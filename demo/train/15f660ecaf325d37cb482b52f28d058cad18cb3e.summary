-- in the past , if you wanted to be able to be able to lift more weight you would have to spend months bulking up at the gym			0
now , with a new invention from a group of engineering students at the @entity7 , you can just strap on an external bicep and you are ready to go			1
the bionic device , called the @entity10 , is the brainchild of four mechanical engineering students who , in their final undergraduate year , built an upper - body exoskeleton that can be used in physical therapy and manual labor			1
the invention won its inventors $ 10,000 in the @entity17 and has recently been shortlisted for the 2013 @entity19 award			1
the @entity10 straps directly to a user 's right arm to help lift heavy objects that the user would n't normally be able to lift			1
its inventors believe that it will be useful in aiding physical rehabilitation , both for people who have suffered upper body injuries and for those with pre-existing muscular - skeletal disorders			1
the @entity10 's inventors say the exoskeleton can also be used by people whose jobs require heavy lifting such as warehouse workers , removalists and couriers			1
" with the @entity10 , we wanted to create something that could both augment a user 's natural strength as well as help someone perform physical therapy in their own home , " says @entity36 , one of the @entity10 's inventors			1
" we wanted to create something that was low - cost and easy for a user to put on and strap to themselves			0
" according to the @entity48 , back disorders are one of the leading causes of disability for people during their working years			0
the @entity53 says that back problems afflict over 600,000 employees each year with a cost of around $ 50 billion annually to the @entity58 economy			0
the problem is significant in other countries : the @entity61 says that worldwide , 37 % of lower back pain is due to injuries sustained in the workplace			0
@entity36 says that addressing this problem while being attentive to user comfort was one of the primary motivating principles in designing the device : " we wanted something that was comfortable for the user , something that mimics the body 's natural mobility and range , so we definitely went through a lot of testing in order to get to where the design is right now			2
" the @entity10 attaches to a user 's right arm with a power motor at its elbow joint			2
the bionic limb can lift approximately 40 pounds of weight , augmenting a user 's natural strength			2
the arm is predominantly made of aluminum and steel components , and is powered by a @entity92 battery			0
as well as helping lift weight , the arm can also be locked into any position with a ratchet brake to hold an object steady without any exertion from the user			0
@entity99 , an engineer and co-founder of @entity101 , calls the @entity10 " exciting , " but adds : " i would caveat that with the fact that it 's a very tough product to launch for a lot of reasons ... it needs to feel right ( and ) i think there 's also some pretty significant safety concerns ... we are taking a piece of machinery and integrating it with a person and so naturally you need to make sure that there 's no way to injure someone			1
" still , @entity99 says that for young engineers , the @entity10 represents an impressive achievement : " they 've managed to combine a pretty wide variety of disciplines both dealing the mechanical side of things -- the design and the electrical -- and the software side of things as well			0
" @entity36 says that the @entity10 team intends to keep working on the exoskeleton with a view to one day bringing it to market : " the four of us definitely want to use our engineering tool kits to better the quality of life of those around us			2
i think that 's one of the things that technology really has the power to do			0
