-- @entity1 is getting fatter , according to a new report , and bulging waistlines will rack up big health care expenditures within the next two decades			2
the report , from the @entity6 and the @entity7 , draws on previously published government data to make predictions about what consequences an upward obesity trend would have for individual states			1
it also projects that the health of the country -- and the dollars spent on the health care system -- would benefit from even a 5 % reduction in the average body mass index			1
the report is called " f as in @entity21 : how obesity threatens @entity1 's @entity23			1
" the @entity1 @entity24 found , in data published in august , that @entity26 is the country 's leader in adult obesity , at 34.9 %			1
that number could rise to 66.7 % by 2030 , the new report found			1
the new analysis also projected that obesity rates in 13 states could rise above 60 % among adults by 2030			1
by that year , every state in the nation may have adult obesity rates above 44 % , including 39 states with rates higher than 50 % , the report said			1
this is consistent with a 2012 study in the @entity43 , which concluded that by 2030 , 42 % of adults will be obese			1
that study forecast $ 550 billion in health care spending from now to 2030 as a result of rising obesity rates			1
just how fat ? but some experts are skeptical about how accurately obesity trends can be predicted			1
methods of calculating how fat @entity1 will be in the future vary greatly , and there 's no accepted standard of determining it , said @entity56 , director of the @entity57 at the @entity58 at @entity59 , who was not involved in the new study			1
" i do n't mean for a moment that we should not be taking steps to reduce obesity , " @entity61 said			2
" if it increases in prevalence , it would be a more serious problem			0
and even if it decreases in prevalence , without us intentionally doing anything in the immediate term , i 'd be shocked if it 's going to vanish			2
" interventions intended to reduce obesity should take place regardless of what the projections say the numbers will be in the future , he said			1
the @entity24 data indicate that the @entity85 is the most obese region of the @entity1 , but that may not be entirely true either , said @entity87 , professor of biostatistics at the @entity58 at @entity59			1
no one was weighed or measured in the collecting of the information ; people were merely asked about their heights and weights via telephone -- so they could have lied			0
@entity87 speculates that there may be bias in the data because " there 's not a social stigma attached to being fat in the @entity85 , " he said			2
" if you ask people how fat they are , they tell you			0
" correlations between obesity and the @entity85 may be tied to other factors , @entity61 said			0
certain ethnic groups , people from rural areas , and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be obese than others			0
it is not known whether there is a particular reporting bias in the @entity85 , or whether lifestyle factors influence obesity there , or if the trend has both components , @entity61 said			0
more obesity leads to more disease , and money for making projections , the new study uses a peer - reviewed model that was used in an analysis of obesity trends in a 2011 article in @entity131			0
the @entity131 study used data from the @entity134 , whereas this one used @entity24 data			1
but note that the methodology for the @entity24 data was different from years past			1
for the 2011 survey , the @entity24 included cell phones for the first time			1
that means trouble for comparisons between this year 's results and surveys before it			0
authors of the new report noted that in 1995 , @entity26 's obesity rate , which led the nation at that time as well , was only 19.4 % , and that 20 years ago , no state was above 15 %			1
but these numbers were not determined the same way as the 2011 data			0
if this report 's projections are correct , the disease burden as a consequence is significant			2
between 2010 and 2020 , new cases of type 2 diabetes could increase tenfold ; so could stroke , coronary heart disease , hypertension and arthritis			0
the number of cases could double again by 2030 , the report said			2
" ( if ) we stay on the current track , we 're going to see unacceptably high rates of obesity , and more importantly , unacceptably high rates of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , obesity - related cancers , arthritis , that will really place a huge burden on our health care system , " said @entity172 , executive director of @entity173			2
other data have also suggested diabetes increases			0
a 2010 analysis from @entity185 's @entity184 and @entity186 found that more than half of @entity1 will have diabetes or pre-diabetes by 2020			0
the researchers said these diseases will account for nearly $ 500 billion in total health care spending			0
current estimates suggest that the yearly medical cost of adult obesity today is between $ 147 billion and $ 210 billion , the study said			1
the report found that by 2030 , an extra $ 48 billion to $ 66 billion per year may be spent treating preventable diseases associated with obesity			1
interventions but there is hope , if adults across @entity1 would reduce their body mass index , the report said			0
if the average body mass index were lowered by 5 % by 2030 , states could save billions of dollars while helping many people			2
that 's the equivalent of a 200 - pound , 6 - foot - tall person losing 10 pounds			0
" we really are looking at two futures for @entity1 's health , " @entity211 , assistant vice president and deputy director for the @entity7 's @entity213 , said at a news conference tuesday			0
in this scenario , the report found , more than 100 cases of obesity - related cancer for every 100,000 people would be prevented in all states			2
nearly 800,000 @entity225 would avoid diabetes , and about 660,000 @entity225 would avoid a stroke or coronary heart disease			0
and savings in health care costs could be between 6.5 % and 7.9 % in most states , the report said			2
the report recommends several policy interventions , such as increasing physical activity in schools , supporting healthy nutrition , putting in place new standards for school meals , and promoting preventive health care services			0
@entity211 highlighted @entity242 as a city that has shown a commitment to reducing obesity , and where efforts are paying off			0
a @entity24 report found that obesity among the city 's public school students has declined in recent years , although only from 21.5 % to 20.5 %			1
@entity242 has implemented several initiatives over the last decade aimed at schoolchildren , including removing all sodas and drinks sweetened with sugar from vending machines , offering free breakfast to all students , and getting rid of fryers			0
the @entity260 , a @entity242 - based nonprofit group , has been bringing supermarkets to communities that need them and ensuring that food stamps can be used at farmers ' markets			0
" the city is the first to succeed in reducing disparities in obesity rates , " @entity211 said			1
" the city achieved the greatest achievements in ( body mass index ) among @entity274 males and @entity276 females , two groups that historically have experienced higher rates of obesity and related health problems			2
" @entity225 , @entity26 and @entity283 are also starting to show declines in childhood obesity rates , she said			1
@entity288 - approved diet drug @entity286 now available			0

@entity24 : @entity26 has highest rate of adult obesity
new report : every state may have adult obesity rates above 44 % by 2030
some experts skeptical that it 's possible to predict the future of obesity in the country
