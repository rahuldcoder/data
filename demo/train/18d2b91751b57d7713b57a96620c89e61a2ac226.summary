-- you might think of black holes as indiscriminate eaters , hungrily gobbling up everything in their vicinity			0
but the black hole at the center of our @entity12 galaxy , @entity8 , is not exactly like this , new research suggests			1
instead , this black hole -- and likely other black holes in the centers of galaxies -- must spit out a lot in order to swallow a little			2
it 's been a mystery why black holes at the centers of galaxies in the present universe appear so much dimmer than quasars , extremely bright objects from the early universe that have black holes at their centers , too			1
as @entity33 noted in his famous formula @entity35 , energy is equivalent to mass times the speed of light squared			0
in a black hole , crushed mass gets converted into energy			2
black holes in quasars eat a lot , creating the spectacular brightness associated with them			0
but we do n't find as much radiation emanating from @entity8 , or other black holes in the centers of galaxies in the present universe			0
so what 's going on ? is the hot gas that @entity8 is eating just not radiating as much as the colder gas that quasars capture ? to find out , researchers used @entity54 's @entity53 to take x-ray images and capture other signature of energy			0
the study is published in the journal @entity60 , and led by @entity61 , astrophysicist at the @entity62 at @entity63			0
@entity8 has about 4 million times the mass of the sun. it is located 26,000 light years from @entity66			0
that 's still super far , as one light year is about 5.9 trillion miles , but it 's close enough that human technology can help us see what 's happening to the matter around it			0
the gas swirling around this black hole has a temperature of millions of degrees			1
based on these new observations , researchers suggest less than 1 % of the material that the black hole 's gravity pulls near actually gets sucked in to the " point of no return , " which is called the event horizon			1
instead , a lot of it gets spat back out			0
that 's why the x-ray emission from the black hole is faint ; in theory , the radiation output would be stronger if the black hole were swallowing more			2
" less than 1 % of matter will be actually sacrificed for the freedom of 99 % of gas , " @entity61 said			1
" so , 99 % of gas can escape from the capture of the black hole			1
" why is that the case ? it appears that in order to be gobbled for good by the black hole , material must lose heat and angular momentum , which is a measurement of how an object or system rotates around a particular axis			1
the temperature is important because hotter material is harder to pin down , even for a black hole			1
@entity61 uses the analogy of a sink : you can pour cold water in and watch it spiral down a drain , but if it 's steam , far less will actually go in ; the water particles are more diffuse and energetic			0
according to @entity61 and colleagues , the black hole needs to throw out more than 99 % of the material in order to accomplish this			1
that ejected 99 % , in turn , heats up the environment around it , which affects the evolution of the galaxy as a whole			2
cold and dense gas goes down easier into the black hole , though , and a black hole may sometimes capture a lot of it			1
this is the gas that tends to form a disk , called an accretion disk , around the black hole			1
in the accretion disk , the gas 's energy and angular momentum dissipate , so more of it is swallowed up by the black hole			1
there was more cold and dense gas in the early universe , so black holes at that time were better at accumulating material this way			1
that 's why we find quasars in the early universe that are so much brighter than @entity8			2
@entity159 -- galactic beauty , deadly beast -- discovered 50 years ago the research is important because a galaxy such as ours is intimately linked with the black hole at its center			2
the more massive the black hole , the more massive the surrounding galaxy is , scientists have found			0
" understanding how the black hole grows with time and how the black hole ejects matter and energy back into the galaxy has strong implications for understanding how galaxies form and evolve , " @entity61 said			2
" that , of course , directly affects how stars form and evolve			0
" @entity180 , take note : our galaxy may have gotten to be the way it is by consuming small portions			0
follow @entity187 on @entity188 at @ lizlandau			0

black hole at center of @entity12 ejects more than 99 % of material for the 1 % it captures
this has to do with temperature and angular momentum of gas in its surroundings
in the early universe , there was a greater *abundance* of cold , dense gas
