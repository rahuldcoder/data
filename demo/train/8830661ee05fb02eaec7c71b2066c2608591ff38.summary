-- whether you are young or old , man or woman , very healthy or quite sick , it is almost a certainty that you are going to use a prescription drug in the next year or two			1
these medicines are crucial for preventing diseases and treating all sorts of ailments and problems			0
they are also expensive -- really expensive			0
for example , the best - selling drug of all time , @entity14 's cholesterol lowering drug @entity15 , went for $ 3.50 per pill and up before going generic in late 2011			1
but these days some retail chains are giving away generic lipitor while the rest are charging barely 50 cents a pill			0
prescription drugs cost @entity26 far more than they do people living in many other parts of the world			2
this is because drug companies spend a fortune on direct - to - consumer sales and marketing ( which they do n't do in other countries ) and because other nations negotiate better deals for drugs than private insurers do in the @entity26			2
is there anything that can be done to lower costs and increase the availability of more affordable and equally effective drugs ? yes			0
earlier this year , the @entity26 @entity47 heard arguments in a case that drew little attention in the media : @entity52 v. @entity53			1
when the court decides this case , probably in june , it will either reinforce @entity59 shenanigans that have helped keep prices high and skyrocketing , or finally bring some relief to our pocketbook and escalating national health care bill for drugs			1
the issue is whether companies that own patents for prescription drugs can pay other companies that want to make cheaper generic versions not to do so , a practice known as pay - for - delay			1
one way to get lower prices on drugs is to get generic versions out to replace name - brand drugs			2
generic drugs include the exact same active ingredients as the brand names			0
the difference is the name of the medication and the color or shape of the pill			0
prescription drug manufacturers , fearing the arrival of cheaper generics and knowing or worrying that their patents alone wo n't keep out competitors , try to buy off the competition instead			1
in the case before the court , @entity94 is accused of paying off would - be generic manufacturers of their blockbuster drug @entity100 , a synthetic testosterone used by hundreds of thousands of @entity103 patients , cancer patients , elderly men and others who suffer from low levels of testosterone			2
the generic companies were happy ; they made money for doing nothing			0
@entity94 continued to reap huge profits by keeping its monopoly in the market			0
the only losers were patients who have had to keep paying much higher prices for their name - brand - only drug			2
usually , buying off your competitors is clearly illegal			0
pay - for - delay deals run counter to basic antitrust principles			1
nonetheless , some lower courts , declining to evaluate the strength of a patent , have let @entity59 get away with these deals			0
@entity59 views the settlements as a bargain			0
instead of losing up to 90 % of their market share bcause of the introduction of a generic , companies can simply pay generic manufacturers and make the competition go away			2
a 1984 law , the @entity139 , commonly known as the @entity139 , was intended to speed up lower - cost generic competition			0
@entity59 has managed to completely undermine @entity142 's intent , which was to put in place mechanisms that encouraged generic drug makers to challenge the weak patents often used to protect brand - name drugs			1
unfortunately , the @entity100 case is not unique			0
in recent years , deals between @entity59 and generic drug makers have delayed the introduction of a diverse range of cheaper generics including cancer drugs , @entity103 treatments , blood pressure medications , antidepressants , allergy medications , sleep aids , add medications and more			1
the @entity160 says pay - for - delay tactics cost consumers billions of dollars and the @entity52 estimates these pay - for - delay deals will cost @entity26 up to $ 35 billion over the next 10 years			1
rep. @entity164 , @entity165 , who co-wrote the @entity139 , has been very vocal in arguing that a law @entity167 intended to help reduce the cost of prescription medicines has been hijacked by the drug industry to do the opposite			0
what we have now are the generic manufacturers and @entity59 making a fortune by agreeing to delay competition that would bring lower priced drugs to market			1
a few weeks ago , the @entity179 @entity47 took a hard look at the way big drug companies were using patent extensions to keep out low price competition			1
they said forget itâ € ” that sort of tomfoolery will not be allowed			0
the @entity26 @entity47 would be wise to concur , heed the @entity52 's complaint and bring pay - for - delay to an abrupt end			1
the right prescription for making medicines cheaper and better is to encourage competition , not stifle it with backroom deals where everyone gets a great deal except for the patients			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 and @entity201 .			1

the @entity47 probably will decide in june on @entity52 v. @entity53
@entity200 , @entity201 : @entity59 has kept prescription drug prices high
@entity206 : the court 's *decision* will affect our escalating national health care bill for drugs
they say the @entity47 should end pay - for - delay and encourage market competition
