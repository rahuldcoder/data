-- you 're bound to find all the usual suspects on television pretty easily on @entity4 -- " it 's a @entity6 , " " @entity7 , " " @entity8			1
" but what if you 're feeling like the @entity10 , or you want something a little different this holiday season ? something where strange little creatures spread anarchy through a small town ? or kids home from college run wild on drug binges ? or @entity19 turns out to be evil ? then we 've got the film for you , with plenty of nostalgia as your wrapping paper : ' @entity26 ' ( 1958 ) think the only @entity28 movie is " @entity29 " ? check out this enchanting story about a man who falls under the spell of a witch on @entity34 ( one of the inspirations for the tv show " @entity37 " )			1
@entity38 reteams with his " @entity46 " co-star @entity39 , the witch in question , who uses her cat / familiar @entity42 to get her upstairs neighbor to jilt his fiancee and fall for her instead , even if falling in love might make her lose her powers			2
among her other charms -- she prefers to walk barefoot , even in the snow			2
' @entity51 ' ( 1983 ) in this twist on @entity54 's " @entity53 , " wealthy @entity55 switches life circumstances with a homeless @entity57 at @entity58			1
during his lowest point , @entity60 dresses as a grubby @entity19 in order to crash a @entity34 party at his former employers ' house , so that he can try to plant drugs in @entity57 's desk and perhaps get his job ( and life ) back			2
this , needless to say , does not work -- and probably placed him smack dab on @entity19 's naughty list			2
' @entity75 ' ( 1982 ) one of the most ornately decorated homes for the holidays you 'll ever see is in @entity79 's " @entity75 , " in which the @entity80 takes up the first third of the film ( especially if you watch the televised versus theatrical version , which gives a generous amount of time to the decadent feast , including recipes )			1
it 's the most lavish and luxurious party you 'll get an invite to this season			1
' gremlins ' ( 1984 ) yes , there 's a cute mogwai as a @entity96 present , and tons of mischievous gremlins who really know how to decorate a christmas tree , but " @entity92 " does more than create total anarchy out of the holiday season ; it also exposes its heartbreak			1
@entity103 delivers a chilling monologue about how her father broke his neck trying to climb down the chimney , and she learned there was no @entity19			0
not for kids of any age who still believe			0
' @entity112 ' ( 1987 ) " @entity113			0
" drug busts in christmas tree lots			0
and if you 've ever agonized about what to give someone for the holidays , consider the present @entity120 gives @entity121 -- the unfired hollow - point bullet he would have used to commit suicide			0
see , it really is the thought that counts			0
@entity126 mention : " @entity127			0
" ' @entity128 ' ( 1987 ) " are you coming home for @entity96 ? " @entity131 asks her very recent ex , @entity132			1
he thinks he has a shot at getting her back , even after discovering she 's been sleeping with his best friend , @entity136 ( @entity137 )			2
but as he learns at a very fabulous and very pink " @entity143 " party , decorated with fake penguins on fake ice glaciers , the only snow they 're going to get this @entity96 is cocaine			1
@entity136 is in the throes of a serious drug habit , and despite his friends ' best efforts , it only gets worse			0
the whole piece is impossibly glamorous , decadent , and sad			0
' @entity150 ' ( 1985 ) @entity96 is not what you might expect in @entity154 's classic			1
a mother reads to her children about @entity157 , and as they ask about how @entity19 will come visit if they do n't have a chimney , a team of police intruders drops through the roof and takes their father away on sabotage charges			0
" @entity96 " turns out to be the minister of information , and a bomb goes off in a department store during peak shopping hours -- one of the many swipes the film takes at @entity96 commercialism			1
geeks ' most beloved holiday classics the @entity177 trio : ' @entity178 ' ( 1990 ) ; ' @entity179 ' ( 1992 ) ; ' @entity180 ' ( 1993 ) it always snows at @entity96 because of the ice sculptures that @entity178 creates for the girl he loves			1
@entity185 provides an occasion for @entity187 and @entity188 to kiss ( ok , lick )			0
even @entity189 's own @entity19 ( @entity190 ) and the @entity191 ( @entity192 ) ca n't ruin @entity96 , despite their manipulation of the good - will - toward - men spirit			1
so of course @entity196 ( as directed by @entity198 ) wants some @entity96 , too -- all of @entity177 's creations do			1
' @entity201 ' ( 2003 ) several stories intersect around the holidays ( including those of @entity205 ; @entity206 , before he was a hobbit , as a porn star stand - in ; and @entity210 as the unavailable object of affection for " @entity213 's " @entity214 ) , revolving around the ensemble cast 's different relationships			2
check out the terrible cover of " @entity218 " -- " except , " as aging rock star @entity201 ( @entity219 ) explains , " we 've changed the word ' love ' to ' @entity96			1
' " ' @entity221 ' ( 2006 ) most @entity96 movies are n't about the @entity96 story at all			1
sure , they 've got the trappings of the holiday -- even the ones mentioned on this list have presents , stress , mistletoe , snow , @entity19 and / or parties			0
but in contrast , " @entity221 , " set in a dystopian future where humanity has given up hope after 18 years of mass infertility ( no more babies , no more future of civilization ) , is about a woman who miraculously becomes pregnant			0
she reveals her state to @entity244 in a manger of sorts , to which he declares , " @entity248 ! " and when she gives birth , the baby 's cries cause a ceasefire -- at least long enough to get them out of the building			2
peace on earth still has to wait another day			0
a stocking stuffer -- ' @entity258 ' ( 2010 ) @entity19 exists , but this @entity260 film reveals that the man credited with giving gifts to children all around the world is more about the naughty than the nice			0
after being trapped in a grave for centuries , he 's free , and he 's on a killing / kidnapping spree			2
be careful you do n't make his list .			0

" @entity51 " is a twist on @entity54 's " @entity53 "
the home in " @entity75 " is one of the most ornately decorated you 'll see
@entity96 is not what you might expect in @entity154 's classic , " @entity150 "
