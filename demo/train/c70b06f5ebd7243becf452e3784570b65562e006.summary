president @entity0 told a large union audience in @entity2 on monday that while " republicans in @entity7 love to say no , " he is the one who " placed a bet on @entity5 's workers			1
" in a speech that skirted the line between politics and policy , @entity0 outlined what many democrats are using as a midterm platform , highlighting hopes to raise the minimum wage and pass immigration reform			1
@entity0 also used the speech to portray republicans as obstructionists who are holding the country back			1
the president told the receptive audience that " most of the policies i am talking about have two things in common			2
they are going to help more families get ahead			0
and republicans who run our @entity7 oppose almost all of them			0
" when the crowd broke out in a chorus of boos , @entity0 reflexively turned to a now oft - used line : " do n't boo , vote			1
do n't boo , vote			2
it is easy to boo , i want you to vote			0
" the political line was a staple during @entity0 's 2012 re-election campaign			1
" i want an economy where your hard work pays off with higher wages and higher income and fair pay for women and workplace flexibility for parents and affordable health insurance and decent retirement benefits , " @entity0 said			1
" i 'm not asking for the moon , i just want a good deal for @entity5 workers			0
" although the @entity0 administration billed the appearance as an official @entity60 event set to " underscore the important progress @entity5 has made since the economic collapse , " the @entity56 speech featured a jacket-less @entity0 who , for most the most part , appeared to be in campaign mode			1
" i think eventually @entity7 is going to hear them			0
we 'll break those folks down			0
we 'll just stay on it			0
we 'll just keep at it , " @entity0 said			1
" ' cause the only thing more powerful than an idea whose time has come is when millions of people organizing around an idea whose time has come			0
millions of people are voting for an idea whose time has come			0
" the president used the @entity79 gathering of 6,000 union members and their families to herald organized labor 's role in passing the 40 - hour work week , overtime pay for workers and a minimum wage			1
standing before helmet - clad workers sporting " @entity90 " t - shirts , @entity0 also said he would likely join a union			2
" if i were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my job , i 'd join a union , " the president said to raucous applause			2
" if i were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day 's pay for an honest day 's work , i 'd join a union ... i 'd want a union looking out for me and if i cared about these things i 'd also want more democrats looking out for me			0
" the midterms are important for @entity104 and @entity0 's legacy			1
midterms in a second term are historically bad for the president 's party , and democrats are facing the prospect of losing the @entity113 and staying the minority in the @entity60 in 2014			2
" republicans in @entity7 love to say no , " @entity0 said			2
" those are just facts , the facts of life			0
they say no to everything			0
" while @entity0 focused much of the speech on the midterms , he was noticeably mum on @entity2 's hotly contested race for governor between @entity126 @entity125 and @entity128 incumbent @entity127			1
according to a @entity131 poll , 49 % of likely @entity2 voters support @entity132 compared to 47 % for @entity127			1
the survey has a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points , which means the two candidates are locked in a statistical dead heat			0
before @entity0 's speech , @entity132 walked around @entity56 and shook hands with supporters and union members			1
@entity132 and @entity0 did not appear on stage together , but the gubernatorial candidate did tweet that she had a " great chat " with @entity0 backstage and that she looks " fwd to seeing him again b4 11/4			2
" a spokesman for @entity132 said before the event that the two wo n't appear together because the event is " an official @entity60 event and not a campaign event , " therefore her " participation in the public portion of events would not be appropriate			0
" a @entity157 official told @entity158 last week that @entity0 will appear with @entity132 before @entity159			2
@entity0 also met @entity127 , who greeted and shook hands with the president when he walked off @entity162 at @entity163 in @entity164			1
" had no problem greeting the president just like i have no problem explaining how i differ with him on things like @entity170 , " @entity127 tweeted monday night			1
@entity2 has been a friendly state for @entity0			1
in 2008 , he won the state by 14 points and in 2012 he carried the state by seven points			0
opinion : how labor unions and @entity104 fell out of love			0
