-- on sunday night , as the @entity1 descended through the @entity3 atmosphere and the @entity5 camera on the @entity6 caught its parachute deploy , the mood in the @entity9 became increasingly electric			1
as the rover touched down on @entity3 , the nation seemed to catch the fever and excitement			1
you would have needed a heart of stone not to get at least a little sentimental in seeing the high - fives and emotional embraces of scientists on live television			0
but was the moment a blip ? or are @entity23 rekindling their romance with science after what seemed like a long and tepid stupor ? americans have always been taken with the adventure of the " final frontier , " but perhaps this is not enough to explain our intense interest this week in a technological marvel			1
@entity3 landing : it could be crazier with the rover so far from the laboratories that hatched it , it took light itself 14 minutes to reach us back on @entity42			1
during that time span , we could not communicate with @entity1			0
what if something went wrong ? the waiting seemed like a solar system 's game of chess by mail			0
the destination only made it more gripping : @entity3 has been a lodestone for the imagination for at least a century			2
@entity56 's 1890s views of a @entity3 civilization frantically irrigating its dying world were at last debunked during the mariner 4 flyby in 1964			1
but hopes of life on @entity3 continued			2
in literature , from @entity63 's @entity62 to @entity65 's @entity64 , the @entity3 has become the @entity23 's @entity67			1
@entity42 loves @entity3 -- why we 're crushing on the red planet maybe we saw something deeper in the successful landing of @entity1			2
we experienced -- even if vicariously -- a group achieving unambiguous excellence			1
in a nation where a city like @entity76 can nearly collapse , where consensus on important policy issues seems far off , where some of the " best and brightest " minds of finance have built fragile institutions , how is it possible that a large cast of scientists and engineers can pull off such a remarkable task ? one of the widely reproduced photographs from the @entity9 showed a trio of scientists : the clean - cut , the mohawked and the @entity93 - haired â € ” something unthinkable for the @entity9 of pocket protectors and ties of 50 years ago			2
the @entity97 has come of age , and this century has a chance to see us living on @entity3			2
this is also the era when we might finally understand some of the underlying principles of human society			1
scientists have long sought to unlock the rules and regularities in the natural world			0
likewise , social scientists have long believed in the existence of invisible forces that govern our social world			0
aided by today 's nearly limitless computer power , we can learn from the traces we leave behind on how we actually live and behave			0
we can see not only how traffic jams form and markets crash but how courtrooms are more or less just , how wars have changed and how they might end			0
while science can not capture the exhilaration of a successful society , or the misery of a failed one , it can show us the properties that underlie them			2
as scientists , my colleagues and i are inspired every day to put theories of both nature and human kind to the test , in hopes of answering their whys and hows			0
rover had ' exciting ride ' so is science cool again ? those of us in the laboratories , universities and institutes could be forgiven for not knowing it was ever uncool			0
topics may fall out of fashion , and some can become political battlegrounds			0
what the immense interest in @entity1 's landing shows , however , is that the curiosity that drives all scientific endeavors persists in the nation as a whole			1
complete coverage of @entity3 when a rover millions of miles away can light our hearts , it 's hard to say whether we wanted to know more about @entity3 , or space colonies , or @entity42 , or ourselves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

the landing of @entity9 's rover curiosity on @entity3 generated intense national interest
@entity164 : are @entity23 rekindling their romance with science ?
he says we experienced vicariously a group achieving unambiguous excellence
@entity178 : this is also the era when we might grasp underlying principles of human society
