-- the 5 - year - old girl found the note tucked inside a plastic bag and left in a basket used as a flower pot. april @entity6 , 8 , abducted in @entity7 , @entity8 , was raped and killed 21 years ago			1
the case was not solved			0
" @entity11 watching you , " it said			0
" i am the same person that kidnapped an rape an kill @entity16 tinsely here is a present @entity18 yo you are my next vitem			0
" a used condom was stuffed in the bag alongside the note			0
it was march 2004 -- nearly 16 years after 8 - year - old april @entity6 was abducted from a @entity7 , @entity8 , neighborhood , raped and killed			1
her killer remains at large , and police believe he has surfaced several times , scrawling a message in crayon on a barn in 1990 , then leaving four chilling notes for children in the @entity7 area years later			1
@entity8 authorities are now asking an @entity35 task force -- the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) team -- to help take a fresh look at the case			1
" investigators believe the case is ' highly solvable , ' and after 21 years , their desire to bring april @entity6 's killer to justice is stronger than ever , " the @entity35 said			1
card teams were created three years ago , aimed at bringing together " a variety of experts in child abduction cases who could quickly respond on the ground to help local authorities with time - sensitive investigations , " the @entity35 said			1
while @entity38 responds to abductions and disappearances , the team also works cold cases , like april 's , the agency said			1
" as team members discovered , there is enough evidence -- including notes , pictures , and dna left by the killer years after the murder -- to make investigators hopeful they can break the case			1
" the team includes behavioral profilers , agents and analysts from the @entity35 's @entity70 and coordinators and representatives from the @entity73 and the @entity74			1
april @entity6 was playing outside with friends on good friday , april 1 , 1988			1
as the three girls were moving from one friend 's home to another 's , the first - grader realized she had left her umbrella behind and went back to get it			1
her body was found three days later , in a ditch some 20 miles northeast of the @entity6 home			1
april 's body was clothed , but an autopsy showed she had been raped and suffocated			2
two years later , a teenage boy called police to report a message scrawled in crayon and black marker on the front doors of a barn about 10 miles from april 's home			1
he never saw the writer , according to the tv program " @entity100 , " which profiled the case in may , but each day noticed the print was getting darker and more pronounced			2
although the message was hard to read , the person wrote he had killed april , and that he would kill again			2
crayons were left behind at the scene , " @entity100 " said on its web site			0
police attempted to conduct forensic analysis on them , but came up empty			0
then , in spring 2004 , the four notes appeared at various @entity7 homes , several of them placed on bicycles that young girls had left in their yards			2
all the notes were written on lined yellow paper and placed inside plastic bags along with used condoms or polaroids of the killer 's body , the @entity35 said			1
several notes referred to april			2
authorities have reason to believe the writer of the 1990 note also left the notes 14 years later , @entity7 police said			1
" that tells us that the person 's still around , still out there , " said @entity7 police capt. @entity133			2
" it 's definitely very odd , " he added			0
" even the @entity35 is puzzled by the behavior , that the letters would come out so many years later and then nothing again			2
" dna evidence was recovered from april 's body and from the condoms , @entity133 said			2
while police have no one to match it with at this point , " things have been resubmitted and retested " as technological advances have been made , he said			0
the advantage of the card team , from a local police standpoint , is that members only work such cases , while " we 're local -- we work on whatever happens here , " @entity133 said			0
the team has experience in such matters , and might look at new aspects , angles and possibilities that local authorities have n't thought of , he said			0
federal investigators were deployed to @entity7 to work the @entity6 case earlier this month			2
after the " @entity100 " profile and the renewed push , authorities received between 400 and 500 tips , @entity133 said			0
some could be ruled out right away -- someone who had died between the murder and the 2004 notes , for instance , he said			2
dna samples were taken on about 150 people			0
police are still trying to run down about 50 or 75 tips , he said			0
" that was the purpose , was to go out and run down every single one of these , no matter how vague it was			0
" some of the authorities ' leads , according to the @entity35 , include identifying @entity7 residents who used polaroids as late as 2004 ; tracking down a green paisley bedspread similar to that seen in one @entity185 ; and looking at misdemeanor offenses in the area near the time of april 's death and the 2004 note spree , as offenses like indecent exposure could indicate more serious sex crimes			1
in addition , the @entity35 has released a behavioral profile of @entity6 's killer			1
police believe he is a white male currently in his 40s or 50s who prefers and desires sexual contact with children , particularly little girls			0
" this offender has demonstrated that he has strong ties to northeast @entity7 and @entity207 , " the profile said			0
" this is where he likely lives , works and / or shops			0
you may be standing next to him in line at the grocery store , sitting beside him in the pew at church , or working beside him on the production line			0
" such profiles can be helpful in that they might spur local residents to tell police , " you know , i always wondered about this one guy , " @entity133 said			0
to offer information on the @entity6 case , contact your local @entity35 office or @entity7 police at ( 866 ) 602 - 7745 .			1
