pope @entity2 is not suffering from any specific disease that forced him to resign , his spokesman said tuesday , a day after the news that he was stepping down shocked the world 's 1.2 billion @entity5			1
the pontiff is resigning because he does not feel he has the strength to continue as the church 's leader , the rev. @entity7 said , adding that it was a " spiritual " decision			2
@entity7 emphasized that @entity2 remains pope until february 28 , when his resignation takes effect			2
he dismissed reports in an @entity18 newspaper that the pope 's decision was linked to a medical intervention to replace the battery in his pacemaker , saying that had been a routine procedure			1
@entity2 has had the pacemaker since he was a cardinal , he added			0
@entity2 's service will end at 8 p.m. on february 28 and he will continue his work as planned until then , @entity7 said , including an important meeting with the cardinals and priests this thursday			1
he will hold a final audience in @entity34 's @entity33 on february 27 , @entity7 said			1
despite addressing reporters at length , @entity7 left many questions about what will come next unanswered -- including those concerning exactly when a successor will be elected			2
the @entity42 does not yet know when cardinals will meet in a conclave to decide who will replace @entity2 , @entity7 said			1
@entity42 experts are studying legal documents on the subject , he explained			0
but the conclave is likely to come between 15 and 20 days after the pontiff steps down , he said , and a new pope will be in place before @entity53 is celebrated at the end of march			2
much of the uncertainty stems from the fact this is the first time a pope has stepped down in nearly 600 years			2
the pope said monday he is resigning " because of advanced age			2
" " strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me , " said @entity2 , 85 , according to the @entity42			0
the pope , born @entity2 , will first head to the pope 's summer residence in @entity70 before he likely retires to a monastery and devotes himself to a life of reflection and prayer , @entity7 said			1
he wo n't be involved in managing the church after his resignation			0
read the full text of pope @entity2 's declaration the pope 's older brother , the rev. @entity79 , told @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , that @entity2 had come to his decision without seeking his brother 's advice			1
asked if @entity2 sounded relieved when the pair spoke monday , his brother said : " his voice sounded the same as by every other call			2
he planned the whole event and it worked out well			0
the news is now out in the world , and now his life must continue its normal path			0
" @entity2 , himself 89 , did not specify when his brother began to feel too frail to carry on			2
but , he said , " the aging process causes difficulties , only in the last few years , first as he was 80 and then when you go past 85 ... when you cross these hurdles you feel like everything becomes more difficult			0
" he is not sorry to see his brother step down , he said			2
i can see that the advancement of life brings changes and it goes along these lines			0
i would say that i would have been happy , had he been able to continue , but i take this realistically and soberly -- that it 's for the best			2
" @entity2 's decision has inevitably prompted frenzied speculation over who might assume the papacy in his place			2
while @entity2 wo n't be directly involved in his successor 's selection , his influence will undoubtedly be felt			1
he appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals that -- as of monday -- are set to make the decision			1
the number of electors could drop to 115 , as two cardinals will turn 80 in march , when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote			0
more than two - thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope			1
the announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the @entity34			1
from police officer 's son to pope : the life of @entity2 the @entity42 does not formally invite cardinals to come to @entity141 for a conclave to elect a new pope , @entity7 said tuesday			1
" the cardinals are intelligent people			0
they know to come , " he said , adding that he expected them to arrive during the first two weeks of march			0
much speculation has focused on whether @entity2 's successor might come from @entity148 or @entity149 , rather than @entity150 , where @entity5 congregations are shrinking			1
@entity2 said he expected to see a pope chosen from outside @entity150 one day -- but not just yet			1
" i 'm certain a pope will come from the new continents but whether it will be now , i have my doubts , " he said			0
" in @entity150 , we have many very able people , and the @entity148 are still not so well known and maybe do not have the experience yet			1
" bets are already being placed on which of the cardinals might step into @entity2 's shoes			1
perhaps belying @entity2 's prediction , @entity166 bookmaker @entity164 has @entity171 @entity168 and @entity170 @entity169 are showing as favorites so far , at 7 - 2 odds			0
close behind are the archbishop of @entity175 , cardinal @entity176 , at 5 - 1 and @entity178 's @entity177 , at 7 - 1			0
there are odds of 33 - 1 on @entity182 's @entity181 becoming pope			1
whoever gets the nod , the selection of a new pontiff is expected to go smoothly			0
" we 're not going to have a problem of two competing popes			0
if pope @entity2 still wanted to have influence , he would n't have stepped down , " said senior @entity34 communications adviser @entity191			1
" what 's interesting is how long ago this decision was made -- shortly after the pope 's trip to @entity199 , which was in march of last year , so that was before the whole butler story even broke			1
" the pope 's butler , @entity201 , was convicted in a @entity34 court last year on charges of leaking private papers from the @entity42			1
he was sentenced to 18 months in prison but was pardoned weeks later			0
the leaked papers revealed claims of corruption in the church 's hierarchy			0
as an aside , @entity7 referred to concerns over financial oversight in the city state , which have meant that @entity42 shops and museums have not been able to accept credit or debit cards since january 1			0
" the credit card payments in the state of the @entity34 city are again working , and so the pilgrims as well as the tourists who visit the church of @entity225 's every day can now use the ordinary payment service , including paying for the @entity34 museums , " @entity7 said			1
the payment service is guaranteed by @entity230 firm @entity229 , he said			0
" thus , even though the pope has resigned , things get done , " he added			0
@entity234 @entity233 says @entity2 's decision to resign should prompt wider debate about how long pontiffs should serve			1
" i believe that a pope should have a term limit or be given the privilege to resign from office , if he ca n't do his various duties effectively anymore due to health reasons or old age , " he said			2
meanwhile , @entity18 ireporter @entity245 says she was shocked by the pope 's decision to resign but feels it was the right one to make			1
she warns against judging the pontiff for what she says was obviously a difficult choice , and urges those who are speculating about his resignation to respect matters which are " above " them in knowledge and understanding			0
while not quite unprecedented , @entity2 's resignation is certainly historic			0
the last pope to step down before his death was @entity262 , who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope .			0

@entity269 's brother says he does not expect new pope to come from outside @entity150
no date is yet set for the cardinals to meet to elect a successor , the papal spokesman says
the pope is not suffering from any specific disease that forced him to resign , he says
credit card payments are accepted again in @entity34 , the spokesman says
