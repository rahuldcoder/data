-- @entity1 , which has connections to @entity3 , is a militant @entity4 group that controls much of southern @entity5 and is active around the capital , @entity5			1
it has waged an insurgency against the weak @entity8 since 2007			0
how it started @entity5 has been without any functioning government since 1991 -- perfect territory for different militia and factions to fight over the bones of the old state			0
@entity1 ( which means " the youth " in @entity5 ) emerged in about 2004			1
its gunmen were involved in a series of assassinations of @entity5 who had connections to the @entity20			2
@entity1 began prospering when the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) seized the capital @entity23 and much of central @entity5 in 2006			1
after defeating a coalition of warlords backed by the @entity26 , the @entity21 brought @entity28 - style justice to the capital , temporarily halting the anarchy in the city			0
many people in the capital welcomed the greater security that the @entity21 brought , thanks in part to the effective fighting skills of several hundred @entity1 fighters			1
official : @entity1 leaders contact @entity42 government to negotiate @entity44 invasion six months after the @entity21 established itself in @entity23 , @entity44 invaded @entity5 , with backing from @entity45			1
both governments were concerned that the @entity21 were establishing fundamentalist @entity4 rule and giving @entity3 a foothold in @entity49			1
many of the @entity21 leadership fled , but @entity1 launched a guerrilla war against the 17,000 @entity44 soldiers deployed , drawing support from many @entity5 , for whom @entity44 is the regional arch - enemy			1
the @entity44 quickly occupied @entity23 but failed to pacify much of central and southern @entity5			1
@entity1 was able to regroup in southern @entity5 , aided by the squabbling within the @entity20 - backed transitional federal government			1
in 2008 , the militants began to retake a series of coastal towns south of the capital , and the port of @entity63 became a major source of revenue			0
according to the @entity66 @entity1 collects an estimated $ 35 - 50 million annually in custom tolls and taxes on businesses in @entity63 -- and two secondary ports higher up the coast			0
at the same time , @entity1 commanders split from the political leadership of the @entity21 over talks with the government , which @entity1 rejected			1
for their part , elders in the @entity21 were uneasy with the growing role of foreign fighters within @entity1 and its shift from being a @entity5 resistance force to part of the global jihadist movement			1
links with @entity3 most @entity1 watchers believe that the organizational ties between the group and @entity3 " central " are weak or non-existent			1
both @entity88 and his successor @entity89 lauded @entity1 for its resistance to @entity44 occupation and its waging of jihad			0
soon after the @entity94 invasion , @entity89 encouraged @entity5 to defeat the " crusader @entity44 invaders			0
" some @entity1 leaders are said to have trained in @entity98 , but the majority of young fighters have little knowledge of @entity3			2
@entity103 ' envoy ' dispenses aid in @entity5 @entity1 formally declared its allegiance to @entity3 in february 2010 , claiming it would " connect jihad in the @entity107 to the jihad led by @entity3			1
" it reiterated the affiliation when @entity89 became @entity3 's leader , and most recently declared that it would " sacrifice everything in the attainment of a global @entity113			0
" @entity114 grows @entity1 's best recruiting sergeant was the incapable transitional government and the long power struggle between president @entity118 , a former warlord , and his prime minister @entity120			0
@entity121 , an ally of @entity44 , was eventually forced to step down at the end of 2008 , easing some of the tensions within the fragile government			0
at the same time , some @entity1 factions began what appeared to many @entity5 as senseless attacks -- a suicide bombing against a graduation ceremony for doctors in 2009 which killed 19 people ; an attack on a medical clinic used by @entity136 forces and civilians in january 2010 ; and in october this year another suicide attack against scholarship students gathered for an event near the @entity141			1
that attack killed more than 100 people			0
@entity1 's implementation of strict @entity28 law has begun to alienate many in the way that @entity3 did in @entity147			2
women have been stoned to death for adultery ; amputations and beheadings are common			0
in some areas @entity1 has banned listening to the radio and @entity156 signs ; and it has assassinated several journalists			0
in a country that has little tradition of strict @entity28 , such moves alienate ordinary @entity5			0
who 's in charge ? @entity1 has no conventional hierarchy and is divided into factions , with foreign fighters prominent in some areas and local commanders in control in others			2
it has also had fluctuating relationships with other @entity4 groups in @entity5 , such as @entity172 , with which it joined forces last year			2
the most prominent and established leader is sheikh @entity175 , who has been on a @entity26 list of people " linked to terrorism " for a decade			0
" i am not a terrorist			0
but if strictly following my religion and love for @entity183 makes me a terrorist , then i will accept the designation , " he said five years ago			0
there is considerable tension within the movement over the extent to which @entity28 law should be implemented ; and more recently over allowing foreign aid groups into southern @entity5 to help alleviate a famine that threatens the lives of millions			1
@entity26 carried out @entity5 suicide bombing , @entity183 claim in essence the foreign fighters ( among them an estimated 40 @entity5 from the @entity26 as well as more from @entity197 and @entity198 ) see @entity1 's role as part of global jihad ; most local leaders , especially in the south , have a more nationalistic approach			2
they oppose the government in @entity23 and the role of @entity136 troops in protecting it ; but are unhappy about @entity1 's ban on foreign aid for famine victims			2
taking the fight overseas it 's unclear whether @entity1 -- like @entity3 -- has ambitions to go global			2
it was involved in a double - bombing in the @entity217 capital , @entity218 , in 2010 -- in retaliation for @entity217 's role in the @entity222 force that props up the transitional government			0
an @entity1 member tried to kill the @entity226 cartoonist @entity225 last year in revenge for his depictions of the @entity229			0
and there is concern among western intelligence agencies that @entity1 may forge links with other @entity4 terror groups in @entity49 , such as @entity235 in @entity236			2
the size of the @entity5 diaspora ( 1.5 million strong and concentrated in @entity239 , @entity197 and the @entity26 ) gives @entity1 an opportunity to recruit for missions overseas , but to date the majority of ethnic @entity5 recruited by @entity1 have remained in @entity5			2
@entity244 women found guilty of raising money for @entity5 terror group among an estimated 40 @entity26 who have joined @entity1 , at least two have died in suicide bombings			1
at least one -- @entity250 from @entity251 -- has become prominent as a propagandist and recruiter , even recording rap videos about the @entity44 invasion and dying as a martyr			0
" we are all @entity88 , " he is said to have told an @entity1 rally days after @entity88 's death			0
current situation in recent months , @entity1 has suffered a series of reverses in @entity23 , with a senior figure being killed at a roadblock and @entity136 troops pushing the group out of several neighborhoods			1
it 's also on the defensive in its heartland in southern @entity5			1
@entity42 has blamed @entity1 for the abductions of several foreigners in northern @entity42 and has begun a cross border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer in southern @entity5			1
there have already been several clashes between @entity1 and @entity42 forces , with the @entity42 vowing to press on to @entity63			2
@entity42 vows to hit @entity1 across @entity5 border around the capital , @entity1 's tactical withdrawal from @entity23 has been followed by a rash of suicide attacks and ambushes as it has resorted has stepped up suicide attacks as it 's lost ground			1
few analysts expect a decisive victory for either @entity1 or the government and its foreign backers			0
but regional analysts fear that under pressure , @entity1 may lash out with attacks in @entity42 and elsewhere .			1

militant @entity4 group has @entity3 connections and some control of southern @entity5
@entity1 emerged in 2004 and grew when @entity21 seized @entity23
organizational ties between group and @entity3 " central " are thought to be weak
some fear that under pressure , @entity1 will launch attacks in @entity42 and elsewhere
