-- in the history of organized athletics , there has never been a person who needs to come back again less than @entity5			1
yes , you have read that correctly			0
i am urging the greatest swimmer in all of sports to keep his word , forget about @entity12 in 2016 and retire			1
to ignore his mother and his sisters and @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity18 and to once and for all hang up his goggles and @entity21			2
because athletics enthusiasts are a peculiar people ( aka : crazy ) , we always beg our heroes to stick around longer than they should			2
it 's the reason a portly , 40 - year - old @entity26 hit .184 in @entity27 in 2010 and the reason @entity29 stepped back onto the tennis court in 1991 ( wood racket in hand ) -- only to win nary a single match			2
it 's the reason our final snapshot of @entity36 is an embarrassing stoppage against @entity38 and the reason @entity40 arrived at spring training with @entity42 in 1991 throwing big , fat , @entity44 meatballs			2
why , it 's even the reason a 41 - year - old @entity17 , @entity47 ' predecessor as our own personal aquaman , jumped back into the pool to qualify for the @entity51 in @entity52			1
he , of course , failed -- by a whopping two seconds			0
news : @entity55 legend @entity47 : ' i 'm done with swimming ' we convince these men and women that they can still do it , that it 's worth one more shot , that age is just a number , that legend is a gift of the gods , and to not use it is shameful			1
( @entity18 , the former @entity55 swimmer who now works as an @entity70 commentator , recently said he believes @entity47 will likely come back because " he 'll be able to walk through airports in a couple years and not be mobbed			1
" there is a word for this line of thinking : sad			0
) then , predictably , when they fall short , we bemoan that the effort was ever made			2
we offer comments such as , " boy , that was pathetic " and " he should have stayed retired " -- forgetting that we were the ones pining for the return			0
again , sports fan are crazy			0
yet the inevitable disappointment of a then - 31 - year - old @entity47 underperforming in @entity12 ( and , for the record , 31 in swimming is 40 in real life ) is n't the no. 1 reason he should stay away			1
no , @entity47 needs to remain retired because , quite frankly , life in a pool sucks			1
ok , not for a week , while vacationing in @entity95			0
you wake up at 5 a.m. , spend four hours in a pool , go home , sleep ( in your @entity101 oxygen tank ) , return to the pool for another two hours , eat ( a disgustingly healthy and bland ) dinner , go to bed , then repeat the following day			0
and the day after that			0
and the day after that			0
and the day after that			0
and ... for , hell , 1Â½ decades , @entity47 ' existence has revolved around the insidious smell of chlorine			1
when he talks , one can hear -- very clearly -- his weariness over the whole endeavor			0
" these @entity55 have been great , but			1
... " but @entity47 needs a life			1
if i 'm @entity117 , @entity5 's mother , i cease with all the @entity12 jabber ( really , the woman needs to stop ) and say the following : " son , i 'm proud of you			1
you 've done amazing things			0
but you 're 27 , and life is short			1
you 've made lots of money in endorsements			0
here 's a backpack , a @entity130 's and a one - way ticket to @entity132			0
sleep in hostels , drink lots of beers , hit up @entity140 and @entity52 and @entity141 and @entity142 and @entity143 and @entity144			0
tell the ladies you 're @entity5 if it helps , or just pull your cap down low and call yourself @entity148			1
just make sure and live ! " when we watch the @entity55 on tv , and the uplifting music is piped in and the anthems are played and tears stream down the cheeks of winners , we are witnessing a sliver of time -- a singular moment that encompasses 1/1,000,000,000th of an athlete 's existence			1
it is romantic and lovely ; @entity162 the former @entity55 volleyball star , calls the experience , " the height of euphoria			2
" but that euphoria , like all things , passes , and at day 's end many athletes are left wondering not whether they should have stayed on longer , but whether , in missing senior proms and romantic summer nights and family vacations , they surrendered too much			0
after three @entity55 and 22 medals , it is time for @entity47 to stop surrendering			1
it is time to live			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity179 : @entity5 should stick to his plan , forget @entity12 in 2016 and retire
he says sports history is lousy with icons who did n't quit when they should have and fell short
he says main reason to ignore *advice* to keep *competing* is that @entity47 should begin to live life
@entity179 : @entity55 is great moment in time , but it ca n't last
