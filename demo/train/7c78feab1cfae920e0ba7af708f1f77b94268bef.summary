-- @entity2 president @entity1 has suddenly shifted his attitude toward the @entity5 extremist group @entity4 , as violence spreads across northern @entity2			1
a week ago , @entity1 warned the group had infiltrated the government and security forces and vowed ( again ) to stamp it out			2
but in an interview with @entity13 news agency thursday he said that if @entity4 identified itself and stated clear demands the government was ready for dialogue			1
he also acknowledged that military action alone would not stop @entity4 ; and northern @entity2 needed economic development			1
but @entity2 - watchers think this apparent carrot may have come too late			1
@entity4 's purported leader , @entity21 , responded in an audio message : " we 're killing police officers , we 're killing soldiers and other government people who are fighting @entity27 ; and @entity28 who are killing @entity30 and talking badly about our @entity32 religion			1
" over the last month , @entity4 has carried out multiple bombings and shootings across the north ; hundreds of people have been killed			1
its targets are frequently police and government officials , but most of the casualties are civilians			0
on one day last week , at least 200 people were killed in @entity2 's second city , @entity45			1
( on monday , militants launched new attacks			2
) who are the @entity4 ? one @entity2 analyst describes the @entity45 attacks as a " breathtaking show of force " by @entity4 -- one that fits a pattern of bolder and better coordinated attacks over the past year			1
@entity56 , a writer who is a frequent visitor to the region , told @entity0 that the " federal government has completely lost control of the north - east , despite deploying thousands of troops and establishing a @entity61			0
" now , he says , " it looks like this insurgency has broken out of the north - east			0
" and what 's worrying , he says , is that there 's " not a whole lot of visible effort from the federal government to calm things down			0
" @entity2 ireporters on uncertain present , and future @entity74 , @entity75 analyst at the @entity76 , says that @entity4 's main aim appears to be humiliate @entity1 's government , tapping into an existing sense of grievance among @entity30 in the north			1
he and other analysts say the government 's heavy - handed response has played into @entity4 's hands			1
" the impulse is to hit back hard and there are political pressures for a crackdown , " de @entity74 argues , " but @entity1 is so weak in the north that he needs to be careful not to alienate people there further			0
" long the poorer part of @entity2 , the north lacks infrastructure such as reliable power			1
since the end of military rule much of the region has felt excluded from the system of patronage that fuels @entity2 politics			1
when he acceded to the presidency in april last year , @entity1 broke the unofficial rotation of @entity106 and @entity30 as head of state			0
@entity1 : @entity2 's embattled president @entity56 , who is with the @entity109 , says poverty has fed @entity4 's ranks			1
it is no longer a sect of @entity32 fanatics but has the support of disgruntled politicians and their paid thugs			0
one source says young men are being paid as little as $ 2 a day to take part in the group 's attacks			1
compounding the situation , the government has so far treated @entity4 as a security problem rather than a political problem			1
because of a lack of trust , security forces find it hard to gather actionable intelligence and different security branches often compete with each other rather than share information			0
a former @entity136 ambassador to @entity2 , @entity137 , says the response of the security forces so far has been " abysmal " -- which is probably why the inspector - general of police was fired this week			2
the @entity140 is probably the most competent branch , he says , but does n't share intelligence			0
@entity56 agrees : " the security and intelligence apparatus is entirely stove - piped			0
" the scale of the attacks , and the subsequent discovery by police of new pick - up trucks in @entity45 wired to explode , suggests @entity4 is not short of money			1
that in turn sparks another debate			0
some analysts believe it is financing its activities through extortion and bank robberies			2
but the @entity2 government , the @entity158 and @entity136 officials say there is evidence @entity4 is part of a wider west african jihadist movement , and has developed links with @entity165			1
a @entity158 report issued last week says arms smuggling throughout the region in the wake of the @entity171 revolution is rampant			0
" large quantities of weapons and ammunition from @entity171 stockpiles were smuggled into the @entity168 , " the report said			0
the weapons included rocket - propelled grenades , explosives and even anti-aircraft artillery			0
" some of the weapons may be hidden in the desert and could be sold to terrorist groups like @entity165 , @entity4 or other criminal organizations , " the @entity158 report said			1
@entity74 of @entity182 says the increasing use of suicide bombings " speak to the real possibility that this movement is getting support , training and possibly finance from outside			0
" but , he says , @entity4 did not grow out of @entity165 ; nor is there any evidence of foreign fighters among its ranks			1
@entity137 agrees , noting that its recent statements have not included jihadist slogans or anti-western rhetoric			0
while contacts with other groups are possible , there is no indication of close co-ordination			0
the @entity158 report notes that " although @entity4 has concentrated its terrorist acts inside @entity2 , seven of its members were arrested while transiting through @entity205 to @entity206			1
" they were allegedly carrying contact details for known @entity165 members			2
just as the jury is out on @entity4 's relationship with global jihad , so there is great uncertainty about its aims and structure			2
different spokesmen focus on different demands , and government officials have said there is no leadership or manifesto they can address			0
last month , one @entity4 spokesman demanded all @entity28 leave the north within three days , and a subsequent video made by @entity226 , railed against @entity28			2
" they killed us , destroyed our mosques and displaced us , " he said			0
" the @entity106 religion that you are practicing is not the religion of @entity27 ; rather -- it is unbelief			0
" but @entity137 , now with the @entity234 and author of " @entity2 : dancing on the @entity239 , " says it would be simplistic to regard @entity4 as a cohesive group motivated mainly by animosity for @entity28			1
there is a strand that follows the strict version of @entity32 preached by its founder , @entity243 ; there are opportunists who rob banks and traffic arms ; and there are northern politicians drawing on the discontent that @entity4 represents			2
@entity137 and @entity56 also point out that @entity4 has frequently attacked figures in the wealthy @entity30 establishment too -- accusing them of selling out to the federal government and not adhering to @entity255 law			2
@entity56 says many of the poor regard the traditional @entity30 hierarchy as complicit in their misery			0
after the 2011 elections , crowds attacked and burned down the home of the @entity263 , a pillar of the @entity30 hierarchy who had supported @entity1			0
even if @entity4 's aim is not to split @entity2 into religious camps , the effect of its violent attacks could be hugely divisive , according to @entity272			1
" if they continue to escalate , " he says , " they could tear apart the ethnic and sectarian tapestry of @entity2 in slow motion			2
" despite its many problems , @entity2 has natural wealth and a growth rate of 7 %			2
@entity4 is unlikely to have much impact on the broader economy , but @entity2 's boom is concentrated in the south and may lead to even greater inequality , and a still greater sense of grievance among the marginalized @entity30 communities in the north			1
@entity1 's olive branch may be intended to avoid that risk			0
but there is considerable political pressure on him not to make concessions to terrorists			0
and there is every sign that some elements of @entity4 prefer a future of extortion -- and explosions .			2
