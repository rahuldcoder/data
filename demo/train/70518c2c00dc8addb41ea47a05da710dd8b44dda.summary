-- the press does not have the right to get access to the government 's investigation into the deadly august accident at the @entity7 , a federal judge in @entity9 ruled tuesday			1
rescuers drill into the mine on august 16 to try to reach the miners			1
three people died in rescue attempts			0
@entity16 district judge @entity15 said there is no constitutional basis for him to make the investigation public			1
" plaintiffs argue that the @entity22 mandates public access to the type of @entity25 [ @entity25 ] proceeding at issue in this case , " @entity15 wrote in his order			1
" they point , however , to nothing specific in the @entity29 to support their claim			0
" a coalition of news organizations including @entity0 , the @entity33 , the @entity34 and the @entity35 filed suit last week seeking to stop the investigation into the @entity7 incident until a judge could decide whether the proceedings should be open to the public			1
the suit asked for @entity15 to grant a temporary restraining order to stop federal investigators " from conducting any more closed proceedings " and to release the transcripts from the proceedings that have already taken place			0
@entity48 , a @entity49 attorney representing the media organizations , said they are " disappointed , but not disheartened			2
" the news organizations are considering appealing the ruling within the court system			2
they are also considering a possible appeal to @entity57 that would require @entity25 to hold public hearings " on these important matters , where the actions of @entity25 as well as the mine owner are under question			2
" certainly , @entity25 should not be allowed to investigate itself in secret , " @entity48 said in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" if the courts do n't intervene , hopefully @entity57 will find a way to allow public scrutiny of @entity25 's investigations of itself and its regulated mines			0
" the @entity70 in @entity9 is pleased with @entity15 's decision , but wo n't comment further " since this is ongoing litigation , " said spokeswoman @entity73			2
attorneys for @entity25 did not immediately respond to a request for comment from @entity0			0
on august 6 , a cave - in of the @entity7 trapped six miners			1
ten days later , three other people , including an investigator for the @entity16 @entity81 's @entity25 , died as they attempted to reach the trapped miners , whose bodies have not been recovered			1
@entity15 said there is no established precedent under which he could make the investigation public			1
some cases the media organizations referred to have to do with access to criminal trials , he wrote , and " the court can not make the leap that plaintiffs suggest by concluding that because the public has a @entity22 right of access to hear witnesses in a criminal trial , they also have a right of access to private government investigatory interviews			1
" the media organizations claimed in their suit that the same @entity9 federal court , after a similar accident 20 years ago , ruled that @entity25 had to make its proceedings public			1
government attorneys said in their response to the suit that the decision was later vacated as moot , and even if it had not been , that case involved formal hearings open to outside groups but closed to the media			1
@entity15 agreed with the government in his ruling , saying the facts in the previous case differ from those in the current situation			0
" in this case , @entity25 is conducting private , government - only interviews			2
unlike [ the previous case ] , no company or union representatives , or any other outside individuals , are permitted to attend or participate in the interviews			0
" the ruling in the previous case allowed @entity25 to exclude the media so long as interview attendants were limited to @entity25 personnel , a court reporter , the person being questioned , and his or her attorney or adviser , @entity15 wrote			0
" this is almost the exact situation in this case			0
the only difference is that in this case a state official [ who is part of the investigation team ] and a notary are also present			0
" the media organizations claimed in the suit that media access to the investigation would ensure it is conducted properly and minimize attempts by the government to distort the truth			1
the government claimed that media access could compromise the investigation through the release of incomplete information or by influencing the statements of those who had not yet been interviewed			1
" the court finds any of these policy arguments persuasive , " @entity15 wrote , but said it was not his place to make such decisions			0
" while it may be true that requiring all government investigations to be open would result in greater accountability and more accurate information , if such a requirement is to be imposed , it must come from a statute that is debated and passed by @entity57 and signed into law by the president			2
" it is not this court 's or any other court 's role to make law , only to interpret it			0
