@entity0 was the world 's invincible sporting superstar , unbeaten on the tennis court for 10 years and still at the top of her game			1
then one day , while she was sitting on her sofa watching tv , she decided it was time to retire , just like that			0
the @entity11 grande dame of wheelchair tennis ended her career in 2013 on a winning streak of 470 matches -- an achievement second only to @entity18 squash great @entity20 's record mark of 555 straight victories set in the 1980s			1
" that decision to walk away , to walk into a world you do n't know , have no experience in , was one of the scariest times in my life , " @entity0 told @entity1 's @entity22			1
" sometimes it still is scary ! " an emotion fueled moment the previous summer had acted as a catalyst for @entity0 's decision to step away from competition			1
after winning a seventh @entity38 gold medal at @entity39 , she broke down in tears , explaining to the media huddled around her , " there was so much pressure on me			1
everybody just expects me to win gold , expects it to be easy			0
" a new life after toiling and training for 20 years , she thought enough was enough			2
" it was such a relief to win that medal , " says the 33 - year - old @entity0 as she reflects on her self - imposed sabbatical			1
" so i decided to take a break after the @entity38 and i enjoyed not having to deal with the pressure anymore			1
" i was at home watching the @entity57 [ in 2013 ] and i realized i did n't miss it			0
i did n't want to be in @entity59			0
i enjoyed being home so much more			0
i was 32 and ready to start a new life			2
" the transition from professional tennis player to a mere mortal was not easy for the wonder woman from @entity66			2
@entity0 dominated her field , winning seven @entity38 gold medals , 21 grand slam singles crowns and 169 singles titles overall , plus 159 in doubles competition			1
" it 's difficult to be retired and not to be an athlete anymore , " @entity0 explains			1
" there are some days that i miss it			0
" winning matches , getting applause , hanging a gold medal around your neck , i guess that is some kind of addiction , something you want to feel constantly			1
" i do n't have that anymore			0
now in everyday life , it 's not every day that people come up to me and say i 'm doing great work			2
" i had to get used to the fact that it 's not going to be there anymore			0
" as an athlete your life is also so structured ; the time you get up , the time you could eat , when you could go on holiday			1
" now everything is possible and sometimes i make the mistake of planning my day too full , even after two years ! " she may be retired from the professional game but @entity0 still has a jam - packed to - do list			1
@entity102 of that list is running the @entity104 , which encourages children and youngsters with a physical disabilities to participate in sport			0
the foundation helps organize sports days in the @entity11 but is also intent on improving sporting opportunities for disabled children around the globe			1
" i do n't think a lot of kids with disabilities go out there and play sports , " she says			0
" that needs to be pushed and promoted			0
that 's what i really want to do			0
" @entity0 's own retirement did , however , lead her to the realization that @entity126 is now much more prominent -- and that 's another positive trend she wants to nurture			1
" when i announced my retirement it surprised me , " she explains			2
" it blew me away that i got so much attention from all over the world from @entity133 , to @entity134 , to @entity135			0
" it made me proud , it made me realize that @entity38 sport was grown and known all over the world			1
that was something i fought for all my life , all my career			2
" when i started playing wheelchair tennis there was hardly any recognition or knowledge of @entity38 sports			1
" in the last 20 years , i 've seen the sport grow			0
i 've seen it become more professional and integrated			2
" there were still moments when i thought ' i 'd really like to be on that tv program ' but then some athlete without a disability became the first to call and sometimes that frustrated me			2
" then i realized , we need to see the growing process			0
i think @entity38 sport will get more attention , will become more integrated and will get more recognition from sponsors and companies in the future			1
" cover story her peerless win - record helped @entity0 blaze a trail to promote @entity38 sport , notably when she posed nude for the cover of @entity169 's " @entity168 " in 2010			1
" sometimes , as a disabled athlete , you must think outside the box , " she told @entity1 at the time			2
" i realize that doing the shoot was ' an edgy ' thing to do but i did n't do the photos just to raise awareness of disabled sport			0
" the aim of the magazine is to show how different types of bodies can perform well in sport and i hope that my photos will get that message across			0
" @entity0 is now proactively , and passionately , promoting another message -- increasing the number of integrated tennis tournaments			1
the @entity188 , which began in 1992 , arguably already matches the demands of the @entity191 and @entity192 tennis tours , with 160 tournaments in 40 countries per season			2
the jewels in the crown of its tour are also the four grand slams -- the @entity57 , @entity200 , @entity201 and the @entity202 -- which are staged in tandem with the prestigious able - bodied events			1
" the ultimate dream i have for wheelchair tennis is that it 's going to be a very integrated sport , " says @entity0 , who is the tournament director for februrary 's @entity206 wheelchair tennis tournament in @entity207 which is played alongside the elite men 's event			1
" able - bodied tournaments are one of the best platforms we have to showcase what people with disabilities can do			0
" to show we are just human beings with ambition and a love of competition			1
" adrenaline rush @entity0 was introduced to wheelchair tennis after she was left paralyzed following surgery to remove a clutch of blood vessels around her spinal cord when she was just eight years old			1
" the moment they told me i would never be able to walk again is not the moment i remember very much , " says @entity0 , who is paralyzed from the waist down			1
but her first competitive tennis match a few years later still very much lingers in the mind			0
" i was so excited and nervous			0
it gave me goose bumps and adrenaline			0
since announcing her retirement from professional sport in february 2013 , it is basketball -- a sport she gave up when she decided to combine tennis with her university studies in management , economics and law -- which has provided her with a regular dose of sporting adrenaline			2
" i have to admit that i 'm playing basketball now , " @entity0 smiles			2
" i 'm really enjoying being in a team and playing in competitions			0
" but inside the confines of the @entity255 sports complex in @entity256 , just outside @entity257 , the former tennis ace was persuaded to pick up a tennis racquet for the first time in 18 months for @entity1 's @entity22			0
the emotions and muscle memories stirred for @entity0 may have revealed more than a recently retired tennis pro might have wished			1
" i have n't played tennis for a while now after my retirement and i noticed that coming back to the court makes me feel free somehow , " she explains			2
" i feel strong , i feel fast			0
i feel in control , i love that ! now i realize a year and a half not playing tennis is too long			0
" i think i 'm going to go out on court more often			0
" could ' @entity0 the invincible ' consider making a comeback in time for the @entity272 in @entity273 ? the @entity11 ace is keeping her counsel for now but perhaps we should n't bet against 470 straight victories and counting .			1

@entity0 has a winning streak of 470 matches - the most set ever by a *female* athlete
the @entity11 wheelchair tennis star says retirement was the " scariest moment " of her life
she is now an advocate for more integrated tennis events outside the grand slams
@entity0 wants @entity38 athletes to be seen as " just human beings with ambition "
