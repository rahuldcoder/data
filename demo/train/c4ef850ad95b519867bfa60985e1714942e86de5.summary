-- the @entity2 uprising , launched by young liberals hoping to bring freedom , democracy and equality to their country , has finally produced a new president			1
@entity9 , long known as the hard - line enforcer of the @entity11 , has promised to govern for all @entity2 , vowing to protect the rights of women , children , @entity15 and @entity16			1
he says he will preserve all international agreements , implying peace with @entity19 , and has made a commitment to democracy , saying " there is no such thing " as " @entity25 democracy			1
" it all sounds good , and tens of millions of @entity2 , along with millions more around the world , hope he is sincere			1
and yet the @entity11 has much to prove -- beginning with whether or not it can be trusted			1
for many years the @entity11 was banned in @entity2 , so it operated underground			1
since the revolution , @entity2 have had a chance to see it in action			1
what they have seen so far is an organization impressively capable of modulating its message to suit specific audiences to achieve political gain			1
more importantly , the @entity11 has revealed a troublesome habit of breaking its word			1
@entity9 won the presidency , but not before his @entity41 , the political arm of the @entity11 , managed to lose half of its popular support in a matter of months			1
millions of @entity2 soured on the @entity46 group after seeing how it acted since coming out of the shadows			1
its leaders knew their presence would trigger international concern and probably a harsh crackdown			0
when @entity54 fell , they pledged they would not try to control @entity2 politics			1
but they promptly changed their minds			0
the @entity11 leaders promised to contest only a minority of seats in the legislature , rather than trying to win a majority			2
they promised , through @entity9 himself , " we will not have a presidential candidate			2
... we are not seeking power			0
" they broke that promise			0
they vowed to run a thoroughly inclusive process for developing a new @entity2 @entity72			2
they broke that promise , too			0
clearly , the @entity11 , and the soon - to - be @entity2 president , have developed something of a credibility problem			1
in parliamentary elections this year , @entity11 candidates won 10 million votes , almost 40 % of the total			2
the more radical @entity46 party , the @entity82 , took 28 %			0
altogether , @entity46 parties took control of a stunning two - thirds of the seats in parliament			0
the courts recently disbanded that parliament , but not before @entity2 voters had a chance to see it in action			2
it was a sobering sight			0
despite all the promises of supporting the ideals of the revolution and embracing equal rights for women , the parliament took on proposals that would have dramatically set back women 's rights			1
and when they put together a panel to write the constitution , it was so loaded with @entity25 that a number of groups withdrew in protest and filed lawsuits			0
that panel , too , was disbanded by the courts			0
support for the @entity11 collapsed			2
@entity9 won just 5 million votes in the first round of presidential elections , half as many as in the parliamentary election , one of every four votes , and just one in 10 eligible voters			2
he won the presidency only because many voters felt the runoff left two terrible choices : the @entity11 or a return to the @entity54 era			2
many opted to spoil their ballot rather than support either candidate			0
what became clear in parliament is that when the @entity11 gained power , it legislated along much less moderate lines than when campaigning , giving speeches to mixed audiences , or speaking to the foreign press			1
in the past , @entity9 has called for banning women and non-muslims from running for president			1
his election rallies reportedly featured pledges to imposing @entity143 , chants of " our capital shall not be @entity140			2
... it shall be @entity147 , " and other deeply disturbing slogans			0
still , the @entity11 is strategically oriented			2
it keeps its eye firmly on its long - term goals while displaying flexible short - term pragmatism			0
to win the presidency it negotiated with the strongest power in @entity2 , the @entity154			1
@entity9 will not have a free hand to govern , at least not in the short term			0
the constitution is not even a work - in - progress yet			0
it 's unclear what role the president will have			0
and there is currently no parliament			0
@entity2 is in dire economic shape , and the need to continue the flow of aid from @entity168 may temper rash impulses for now , particularly regarding peace with @entity19			1
although less than 24 hours after his " message of peace , " he already seems to be backtracking on that front			0
@entity9 's words must be followed closely , but they must be matched against his actions , especially in the longer term , when the cameras leave @entity178 , the place where @entity2 's revolution started with calls for real democracy and equality			1
his first speech as president - elect touched on the right themes			0
but the @entity11 and @entity2 's soon - to - be president still need to show they are true to the ideals of the revolution , not just clever manipulators of a popular uprising			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

@entity197 : can @entity11 's @entity9 be trusted as @entity2 's president ?
she says @entity11 has broken promises , modulating message for political gain
she says public comments are worrisome on women 's rights , @entity19 *relations* , *enacting* @entity143
@entity209 : @entity9 , @entity11 must show they *'ll* *hew* to revolution 's goals , not just grab power
