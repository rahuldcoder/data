-- the coming elections seem to have fired up an intergenerational war , with the older population cast as the " greedy geezers " eating so much of the pie that they leave only crumbs for the younger generation			2
both @entity9 and @entity10 say that entitlements must be cut			0
the main losers of these cuts will be @entity14 older than 65 who collect @entity16 and cash in @entity19 checks			1
at the same time , both parties agree that we must spend more on the education of the young if we are to remain competitive in the world markets			2
taking from the old is justified on the grounds that they take more out of @entity16 than they paid in , while the young , who pay for @entity16 , will find that the program has gone belly - up by the time they retire			1
well - heeled older people are said to be enjoying the good life while the young ca n't find jobs and are saddled with debt			1
@entity37 , writing in the @entity39 , makes the point with numbers			0
he cites a report from @entity43 that says the median net worth of households headed by those 65 or older rose between 1984 and 2009 by more than $ 170,000			2
at the same time , that of households headed by those 35 or younger shrank by 68 % , to less than $ 4,000			0
sixty percent of seniors find it easy to pay their bills and the same percentage expect their quality of their life to improve in the near future			2
others use rather strong emotive terms			2
@entity58 , writing for @entity60 , refers to a " bleeding up of the national wealth " to the elderly from today 's disenfranchised youth			0
the @entity65 editorial board asserts that " while no parent would honestly sell out their children , the @entity14 has done just that			0
" @entity70 , writing in the @entity69 , defines @entity16 in terms of a class struggle between the " young ' have - nots ' ... against the power , wealth , and influence of the older ' haves			1
' " health care expert @entity78 writes that the " elderly receive the lion 's share ( of health benefits ) while breaking the backs of the young			1
" it makes the elderly sound like the 1 % that 99 % of the young should rail against			2
these hostile statements ignore some elementary and some surprising facts			0
@entity16 comes close to paying for itself , after some recent revisions			1
the way to curb @entity19 , which after all is merely a big reimbursement machine , is to cut the costs of health care rather than leave old people to chose between medications and their meals			1
most important , it should surprise no one that people who completed the work years have earned and saved more than those who are just beginning to work or are early in their work career			1
and elementary fairness says that people who worked all their lives and saved a considerable share of their earnings rather than spent it all , should be allowed to live out their remaining years in reasonable comfort			1
@entity111 : senior victims lose average of $ 140,500 to financial abuse utterly ignored in all these tirades against the old , is the notion that the elderly get much more than young is based merely on public budgets and pays no mind to what happens to the large mountains of private dough			1
the data leave not the slightest doubt that our seniors , far from spending it all on a big going - out party during their retired years -- which they surely are entitled to and could do -- give trillions of dollars to the young in gifts			1
a study conducted by @entity133 and @entity134 of the @entity135 at @entity136 predicts that between 1998 and 2052 , a minimum of $ 41 trillion will pass from one generation to the next			0
they estimate that more than half of these funds will be transferred through bequests to heirs , about a quarter will go to estate taxes and fees , and the rest will be given to charities			0
there seems to be no statistics about the billions grandparents spend , while still living , on their grandchild 's first car , first house , college tuition , and such , but looking around me i find these amounts seem to vastly exceed what grandchildren grant their old folks			0
there is always room for reallocating our public budgets , such as cutting the hundreds of billions we are spending in @entity165 and employing them in nation building at home , or stopping corporate welfare			0
we may even have to cap entitlements			0
but the last thing we need is another heated confrontation and a new line of social division			0
instead , children and grandchildren should draft thank you notes to their elders for saving so much and leaving trillions behind			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

@entity182 : the idea is growing that the old get all the benefits while young suffer
but retirees have earned and saved more over the years and should live in comfort , he says
curbing costs of health care would curb @entity19 ; he writes : @entity16 can pay for itself
@entity182 : in terms of private money , older people give trillions of dollars to the young in gifts
