-- it 's been a @entity2 filled with plenty of goals , surprise , intrigue and -- in @entity8 's case -- an unwelcome incisor intervention			2
along with @entity8 , who was handed a hefty ban by @entity12 thursday for gnawing at @entity14 's shoulder , @entity10 also went home early from @entity16 2014			1
so too did world champions @entity19 , much - fancied @entity18 as well as @entity20 , who managed just one point from three games in a group that saw @entity25 and @entity8 's @entity26 reach the last 16			1
remarkably @entity25 topped one of the tournament 's toughest groups with two impressive wins over @entity26 and @entity18 and a draw against @entity20			1
for @entity34 observers , who perhaps do n't have the chance to watch much @entity36 , this has been a @entity2 that has arguably showcased the tactical innovation and passion of the @entity39			1
" whereas @entity42 coaches were previously laughed off as naive and old - fashioned , there 's every reason to admire the developments that are happening now in places like @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , " former @entity50 chief executive and technical director @entity49 , who has regularly scouted players from @entity42 , told @entity0			1
" there 's no coincidence that some of the biggest @entity34 club sides are in the hands of @entity42 coaches , " added @entity49 , referring to @entity55 's @entity54 manager @entity53 , @entity57 's @entity56 and fellow @entity46 @entity58 , who has just taken charge at @entity60 , and @entity61 , recently appointed by @entity62 " i particularly find the work @entity69 -- and @entity58 previously -- have done with @entity47 highly impressive			1
" both @entity69 and @entity58 have built @entity47 's game around that nation 's cultural and sporting genetic heritage			1
" it 's clear that they have created a playing style around the physical makeup and attributes of the @entity54 , " said @entity49			2
" players from @entity47 were always recognized for their stamina , running capacity , combative spirit and fierce temper			1
" in @entity69 's and @entity85 fast , high - pressing game , they take advantage of those characteristics to the very maximum			0
" for the likes of @entity69 and @entity26 coach @entity93 , nothing is left to chance , with both coaches analyzing their own teams and the opposition with the software package @entity99			1
while @entity69 , @entity102 coach @entity101 and @entity48 's @entity46 manager @entity103 have extracted the very maximum from their players , that has n't been the case with @entity20 and @entity107 , coached by veterans @entity109 and @entity110			1
" maybe the conservative ' safe pair of hands ' approach of @entity34 sides like @entity20 , @entity107 and @entity19 is becoming out of date , " argues @entity49			1
" it 's like they are still subscribing to the idea that a national team manager is all about man - management and that the opportunity to create clear technical and tactical concepts -- especially in terms of the attacking side of the game -- is minimal due to the lack of time spent with the players			0
" but managers like @entity131 's @entity130 and @entity69 prove that a national team job is as suitable as a club job for sophisticated technical concepts			0
" i also think that in @entity34 we tend to overvalue the idea of a manager 's personality , reputation and profile , at the expense of his ideas and ability to invent tactical schemes and concepts			1
" having come into this tournament having won three major tournaments in a row — @entity149 and 2012 as well as the @entity150 -- @entity19 found themselves out after the first two games following a 5 - 1 humiliation at the hands of the @entity155 and then a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity47			1
@entity49 believes this tournament has highlighted the need for national football federations , as well as managers , to continually evolve if they want to stay ahead			0
" i 'm quite confident that the poor performances from certain @entity34 nations will put a lot more pressure on their incumbent managers to come up with clear and unique ideas as to how their sides can be improved , " he says			2
" supposedly being good at man - management and defensive organisation simply does n't suffice any more			0
the smaller non-european nations are catching up tactically , leaving no room for complacency			0
" @entity130 wins special praise from @entity49 for @entity131 's rigorous preparation for this @entity2 campaign , preparation rewarded as " @entity131 " topped another tough group			1
" i know that the @entity177 have been particularly meticulous in their preparations for the tournament , for example by rehearsing match - day routines on the day of certain training sessions , " he says			0
" @entity131 have an amazing team working around the clock during -- and leading up to — the tournament to ensure that every little detail is catered for			0
" maybe this is where some of the other nations fail			0
in football , organization around the team is extremely important and can make a great deal of difference			0
" ahead of the @entity2 there had been talk of how the weather might affect the @entity34 teams , one of the arguments often advanced as to why a @entity34 side has never won a @entity2 in @entity201 or @entity200 or the @entity202 " i do n't really believe that the @entity34 teams have been that much affected by the climatic conditions , " says @entity49			1
" @entity131 , @entity204 , @entity205 or @entity206 are no more used to the conditions in @entity16 than @entity209 sides such as @entity19 , @entity210 and @entity18			1
" besides , @entity131 and @entity202 have done well playing in particularly difficult climatic conditions			0
" @entity212 around the team , such as carelessly picking hotels , training sites and understanding every players ' need is the key to success -- and having competent people to take care of these issues is paramount			0
" the name of the continent where the tournament is held does n't really matter that much if you are well prepared			0
" weather aside , this @entity2 has also demonstrated that @entity42 players might just care more about international football			0
" the @entity42 teams seem to have a stronger identity and the players seem to show an overwhelming sense of pride when wearing the national team colors , " said @entity49			2
" maybe , for a variety of reason , this is is n't quite as strongly felt among @entity34 players these days			2
" it 's a generalization , but if one @entity34 player ends up giving 98 % during the @entity2 and a @entity200 offers 100 % that can make a difference on the pitch			1
" four players have particularly impressed @entity49 in the group stages			2
" i would say the @entity48 @entity246 for showing on the world stage that he 's possibly the best playmaker in the world at present , " he says			2
" @entity249 is performing magnificently , with all the pressure he 's carrying the nation on his shoulders			0
without his creativity and flair , @entity16 would look nothing more than average			2
" i 've also been extremely impressed with the @entity258 center - back , @entity259			0
at only 19 he 's settled so well into the void left by the out - of - form @entity262			0
" it 's amazing , given that @entity259 has just played one single league appearance for @entity57			0
" @entity266 is also having a great tournament for @entity47			2

@entity200 teams @entity16 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity26 and @entity46 qualify for last 16
so too does @entity25 and @entity102 from @entity201
@entity204 praised for reaching *knockout* stages from tough group
*tradtional* @entity34 " *heavyweights* " @entity20 , @entity18 and @entity19 go home early
