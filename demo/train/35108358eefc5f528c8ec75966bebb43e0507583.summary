@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 hierarchy have voted to scrap the policy of rotating @entity6 finals between the six continental confederations , following a meeting in @entity1			1
vice-president @entity9 said the rotation would be dropped from 2018			2
executive committee vice-president @entity11 announced in @entity0 on monday that by a unanimous vote it had been decided to drop the rotation from 2018			2
@entity9 explained that all associations would be free to apply to host future @entity6 finals , providing they did not belong to confederations that had staged either of the two previous tournaments			1
@entity19 is set to host the 2010 event , and @entity21 is expected to have its bid for 2014 confirmed on tuesday			0
@entity3 has been under heavy pressure to open the 2018 bidding to allow nations outside @entity26 and @entity27 and the @entity28 to host the tournament			1
the rotation system meant that after @entity31 dropped out of the 2014 race , @entity21 was left as the sole candidate -- a situation @entity3 president @entity35 wanted to avoid in the future			1
@entity35 said the executive committee rejected a proposal from @entity39 to restrict the competition to the @entity42 region for the 2018 tournament and then open it up			1
" @entity3 's decision does not change our own commitment to try to bring the @entity6 back to the @entity49 , " @entity45 president @entity44 said			1
" i believe that a @entity49 bid will be very competitive			0
" @entity51 and @entity52 shared the 2002 @entity6 and @entity53 was the host in 2006			2
" if you go back to 2002 , and look at the recent history of rotation ... it 's been @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity19 and with 2014 going to @entity62 , " @entity39 general secretary @entity54 told @entity55			0
" i thought in all logic and fairness the next cycle should be @entity39			0
regrettably , that did not carry the day @entity35 indicated there is widespread interest in hosting the 2018 @entity6			1
" already we have a bunch of big , great candidates , " he said			0
other nations interested in hosting the 2018 event include @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and a joint bid from the @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
" i am delighted that @entity3 have opened the door for the @entity6 to come back to @entity74 , " @entity85 prime minister @entity84 said monday in a statement			1
" by 2018 , it will be 52 years since @entity74 hosted the @entity6			1
the nation which gave football to the world deserves to have the greatest tournament back on these shores			0
" @entity74 's @entity3 vice-president @entity94 said : " we welcome the decision made by the @entity3 executive committee and will now consider our position			1
" the @entity98 will discuss the matter at wednesday 's board meeting			0
@entity35 said the @entity3 executive committee would decide on the 2018 hosts in 2011 and that bids would have to be submitted at least two years in advance			2
" i think they should start their bidding campaign tomorrow ! " he quipped			0
the @entity3 supremo confirmed that @entity107 , chairman of @entity3 's ethics committee , would play a key role in the 2018 bidding process			2
" we try to be fair and transparent and we have had a discussion on this matter with the chairman of our ethics committee and we have invited him and his committee to overlook the bid process , " said @entity35			0
" this will be not only looking at the @entity3 executive committee -- you should also have a look at the bidders and he will do that			2
" if there are a large number of candidates for 2018 -- @entity35 mentioned 10 or 11 countries -- then @entity3 will adopt the @entity128 policy of making a ' pre-selection ' to reduce the bidders			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , have announced new rules to clamp down on third - party ownership of players following the @entity136 controversy involving @entity137			2
the new @entity3 regulation states : " no club shall enter into a contract which enables any other party to that contract , or any third party to acquire the ability to influence in employment and transfer - related matters its independence , its policies or the performance of its teams			0
" the @entity3 disciplinary committee may impose disciplinary measures on clubs that do not observe the obligations set out in this article			0
" @entity136 joined @entity137 from @entity21 side @entity155 , who have since become embroiled in an investigation by @entity21 police			0
@entity3 president @entity35 said : " identification of ownership of this club and the transfer of money going from there to @entity74 is a matter which has already been dealt with partially			1
" we have been presented with a new approach about how to try to solve this problem and it will be ratified to come into force at the end of the year			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity3 will end its rotation policy for the hosting of @entity6 finals
confederations who have not hosted either of the previous two finals can bid
@entity74 is likely to put *forward* a bid to stage the 2018 tournament
