-- @entity2 's football players voted friday on whether to form a workers union -- one of the most high - profile efforts by college athletes to demand more rights , possibly including payment			1
but the result of the vote might not be known for months			1
the @entity11 allowed the vote after its @entity14 office ruled in march that @entity2 football players can unionize , deeming them school employees because of the hours they put in , the control the university has over them and the revenue they generate			1
however , @entity2 asked the @entity11 for a review -- and the @entity11 said the results of friday 's vote wo n't be made public until that is finished			1
the review could take months			0
still , the group that wants to represent the players -- the @entity26 -- said friday was special because the athletes , by voting , exercised " their rights under labor laws -- rights the @entity33 has fought hard to deny them			1
" " the @entity33 can not vacate this moment in history and its implications for the future , " @entity26 founder @entity34 said			0
if @entity2 loses the review , the players ' votes would count			1
a majority will have needed to vote in favor for the effort to be successful			0
@entity2 is arguing that players are not university employees but " students , first and foremost			1
' some players at @entity2 say they want better medical coverage , concussion testing , four - year scholarships that cover the entire cost of attendance , and the possibility of being paid			1
they 're led by @entity55 and former @entity2 quarterback @entity56			2
not all of the players were in favor			0
two of the team 's leaders -- quarterback @entity60 and running back @entity63 -- said they would n't vote for unionizing			2
@entity63 told reporters on april 19 that he hoped the " @entity33 does understand some things do need to change , but we do not need a third party to come in between us and the coaches			0
" @entity33 president @entity70 has called the idea of unionized collegiate sports teams " grossly inappropriate			0
" " it would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics , " he said , the @entity33 contends that athletes are paid in the form of a free education			0
athletes also get team - issued shoes and other athletic gear , paid travel , coaching and free medical aid			0
the @entity2 players ' vote came weeks after a class - action lawsuit filed by current players who want the @entity33 compensation cap to be erased , and more than a month before trial is set to begin in the case of former @entity94 basketball player @entity93 lawsuit 's against the @entity33			1
@entity93 is suing on behalf of current football and men 's basketball players , and is seeking to get them a share of the millions that the @entity33 makes off of their likenesses			2
on thursday , the @entity33 proposed changes that would give the five power conferences -- @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 -- more options in how they treat athletes			0
among many proposed changes , the @entity33 may consider allowing schools to increase scholarships to cover the cost of living , and not just the cost of tuition , for athletes			2
@entity0 's @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
