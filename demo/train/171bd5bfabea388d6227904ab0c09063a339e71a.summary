from a distance this may look like an ordinary tree , but get closer and you will discover it is actually a power generator			1
@entity8 company @entity7 has created the " @entity9 " or " @entity10 , " a 3 - meter - tall generator designed for urban environments which makes the most of smaller air currents			1
operating in near complete silence , the wind tree consists of 72 micro turbine " aeroleaves " that rotate in the wind , generating an estimated 3.1			1
while this is n't much compared to industrial - sized turbines , which typically generate in the region of 1 - @entity24 , having multiple smaller turbines has its uses			2
" urban wind is not very strong , but it is very turbulent , " says " @entity29 " engineer @entity28			0
" these turbines need less wind to get started and produce around @entity34 of energy , which could heat a small home , fuel lights or charge an electric car			1
" @entity7 was founded by @entity39 three years ago when he had the idea for the @entity10 while taking a walk			0
he saw the leaves on a tree moving in the wind and started thinking about the possibility of turning that kinetic energy into electricity			1
the current prototype of the tree is steel and the energy made from it goes into the electricity grid and is used locally			1
" we have n't yet optimized the structure , " says @entity28			0
" we are hoping to make the leaves out of eco-friendly materials and for the tree to have as a low a carbon footprint as possible			1
" a 12 - meter tall prototype of the tree will be on display from march 12 for two months at @entity62 , a major public square in @entity64			2
this prototype , which weighs around 5 tons and costs roughly $ 35,000 , is to be used as an educational tool and will aim to show the public the technology behind the structure			0
the wind tree will be mass produced for sale from march 2015 and @entity7 says it has raised € 1.15 million ( $ 1.34 million ) to begin pre-production			2
" the reaction has been very positive so far , " explains @entity28			0
" people do n't know how it works but they like it , they find it magical			0
" there is a very negative view of wind energy , people think it 's ugly and it ruins their landscapes			2
then they see the wind tree and they think differently			2
" @entity7 has had interest from local government in @entity8 and @entity89 , as well as real estate agents and businesses that want to have the tree on their land			1
there are even talks about another demonstration tree in @entity97 next year			0
the @entity10 may not be affordable and practical for everyone , but there are other applications that could be more accessible			0
" our technology is in the mini wind turbines ( the aeroleaves ) , " says @entity28			1
" so we are developing other applications for them			0
" architects have been in touch and are interested in using them in their work , perhaps on the roofs of buildings			0
@entity114 turbines are cheaper to produce and buy than the wind tree			1
" other ideas for the aeroleaves include rooftop foliage installed on buildings , foliage on roadsides and the smart balcony -- where the mini turbines are attached to balcony railings			1
however innovative , this is not the first urban energy source inspired by nature -- check out the " @entity128 " and others in the gallery above			0
watch : @entity131 turns power into paint			0

a @entity8 company has designed an energy generator that looks like a tree
the " leaves " are mini turbines and together could power 15 *streetlights*
