@entity0 -- when president @entity3 threw out the first pitch at the @entity6 ' season opener on monday , he kicked off not only a new baseball season but also a new round of fundraisers at @entity10			1
though @entity3 was n't raising any cash himself on game day , his appearance was the backdrop for at least one ballpark fundraiser monday , the first of what @entity6 president @entity17 hopes will be many political events held at the stadium this season			1
since @entity10 first opened in march 2008 , @entity17 has actively encouraged political operatives of all ideological stripes to hold their fundraisers and receptions at the ballpark , as opposed to more conventional venues such as restaurants or hotel ballrooms			1
" i am absolutely bipartisan when it comes to business , or even multi-partisan , " said @entity17 in an interview with @entity1			2
" we welcome all , and we 've had all come to the ballpark			0
republicans , @entity37 , and i 'm sure other parties as well			0
" @entity17 helped bring major - league baseball back to @entity0 in 2005 after a 34 - year absence			2
since then , federal candidates , major political parties , and political action committees have spent at least $ 432,000 on fundraising events either at @entity6 games or at their facility , according to campaign finance documents filed with the @entity48			1
although campaigns did spend money on @entity6 - related fundraising events when the team played at @entity54 , the records show that spending skyrocketed once the gates opened at @entity10			1
campaign disbursements to the @entity6 for fundraising expenses averaged $ 11,000 per year from 2005 to 2007 , but that increased by twelvefold , to about $ 131,000 , in 2008 , the year the park opened			1
that amount doubled to $ 264,000 in 2009			0
the total dollar amount spent on all fundraisers at @entity10 is likely to be much higher than @entity48 records indicate , since lax federal disclosure rules allow campaigns to pay corporations directly for use of their luxury suites at the ballpark , without having to specify how the money was spent			1
however , regulations do require that campaigns pay full price for all expenses , such as tickets , suite rentals and concessions			0
much of the @entity6 ' success in wooing the campaign crowd can be attributed to a relative lack of variety available on the @entity0 fundraising circuit			2
one @entity37 fundraiser who has held two events at the ballpark told @entity1 that both candidates and donors enjoy the change of scenery			0
it 's a good time to interact with people but also have fun while doing something non-politically related , " she said , speaking on the condition of anonymity			0
" there is a little bit of monotony in fundraisers in @entity0 there 's a formula to it , so this is a little out of the ordinary			0
" @entity17 could not agree more			2
" the key to fundraisers is to get people to come , " he said			0
" we have the added element of holding an event at our ballpark and having a fun evening going on alongside the fundraiser with lots of other things to do			0
" " it 's just so much more appealing to potential contributors than just coming to some hotel ballroom , " he added			1
the ballpark hosted over 40 fundraisers in 2009 , and @entity17 expects that number to increase this year with the midterm elections looming			1
the team advertises its facilities to individual campaign committees , congressional offices , and to national party organizations , including both the @entity37 and @entity131			2
special outreach is made to the members and candidates representing whichever visiting team happens to be in town			0
although holding fundraisers at baseball games is not new , the @entity6 have capitalized on being uniquely positioned in a city with a year - round political industry unrivaled by other baseball towns			1
records show that several teams with national fan bases have not received nearly as much in campaign expenditures as the $ 432,000 the @entity6 have garnered so far			0
since 2003 , the @entity146 have received about $ 207,000 , the @entity147 have received about $ 157,000 , and the @entity148 have brought in just over $ 36,000			0
the @entity149 , which had been @entity0 's venue of choice for baseball - themed political fundraisers prior to the arrival of the @entity6 , received $ 134,000 during the same time period			1
but not everyone is sold on @entity10 as a fundraising venue , at least as long as the team continues to perform poorly on the field			1
" the allure of doing events at their games has worn off , since the home team is n't good			1
we usually struggle to sell tickets for @entity6 games , " said one @entity131 fundraiser , who asked not to be identified			1
" we generally advise our clients to have other types of fundraising events that are cheaper and more successful			0
[ @entity174 hockey ] games sell very well right now			0
" on that point , @entity17 , who has also headed up professional hockey and basketball franchises , says that baseball is the most conducive sport for political fundraisers			1
" the pace is a little slower , " he said			0
" it gives people more of a chance to sit and think and talk typically than there is at a basketball or hockey game			0
" despite his efforts to lure partisan fundraisers to his ballpark , the @entity6 ' top executive sees baseball as an inherently nonpartisan activity			2
according to @entity17 , " a ballpark is a controversy - free zone , a politics - free zone , where everyone can unify behind the idea of just having fun			2

@entity6 president @entity17 encourages political operatives to hold fundraisers at ballpark
spending on fundraisers skyrocketed once gates opened at @entity10 in 2008
ballpark is much more appealing " than just coming to some hotel ballroom , " @entity17 said
one @entity131 says ballpark is n't a good fundraising spot because team is n't playing well
