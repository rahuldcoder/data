befitting its status as a fast - growing oil exporter , for @entity3 this week was to be a coming out party of sorts , as it hosts the 24th @entity6 on @entity7			1
more than a thousand academic , business , civil society and political leaders are supposed to gather in @entity12 , @entity3 's capital city , beginning on wednesday , to discuss " inclusive growth and job creation			2
" conflicting with this image of an emerging regional economic powerhouse , just two days before the start of the @entity6 meeting , @entity3 is in the international headlines for all the wrong reasons : @entity21 , the leader of @entity22 , a militant @entity23 organization , released a video on monday claiming responsibility for kidnapping more than 270 schoolgirls in northern @entity3 last month			1
the @entity22 leader explained that the girls should not be attending school and should instead get married			1
he also threatened to sell the girls in the marketplace because , he said while laughing , " @entity30 says i should sell			0
he commands me to sell			0
" that statement , coming the day after @entity3 president @entity36 held a nationally televised " media chat " in which he vowed to rescue the girls , highlights @entity22 's growing power in the country , as well as the government 's relative inability to stop the group 's attacks			1
if @entity22 's growing insurgency is n't halted in @entity3 , it threatens to jeopardize the largest economy in @entity7 and the some $ 100 billion in oil revenue the country generates every year			1
@entity22 , whose name means " @entity53 education is forbidden , " has been at war with the @entity3 state for years			1
founded in 2002 by @entity57 , a member of the short - lived " @entity3 @entity58 , " it is predominantly focused on attacking the @entity3 government and implementing @entity58 - style @entity61 law			0
@entity57 was killed in 2009 while he was in police custody			0
there is no doubt that @entity22 is a growing threat to @entity3 , but to what extent is it also a threat to @entity53 interests ? so far not much , although that could change			1
in the 12 years since its creation , @entity22 has attacked an international target only once , when it bombed the @entity73 office in the @entity3 capital @entity12 in august 2011			1
a year earlier , @entity21 , the @entity22 leader , had released a statement expressing solidarity with @entity78 and threatening the @entity79 , and @entity80 was reportedly in direct contact with the group 's leaders			1
however , @entity78 has never formalized any kind of partnership with @entity22			1
that said , the group has received some funding from the @entity90 affiliate , @entity91 , or @entity91 ; the exact numbers are unknown , but it is estimated that @entity91 has accumulated $ 90 million , much of it from kidnappings			0
6 reasons why the world should demand action the @entity79 is sufficiently worried about @entity99 terrorism in @entity3 that on friday the @entity100 released a warning to @entity79 traveling in and to @entity3 that " groups associated with terrorism " may be planning an attack on a @entity104 hotel in @entity105 , the country 's commercial center			2
though @entity105 has never been attacked by @entity22 , recent bombings in @entity12 -- the first in two years -- show that militants are increasingly turning to targets outside their home base in @entity3 's northern territories			1
to combat the growing threat of @entity22 , the president placed the northern states of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 under a six - month state of emergency in may 2013 ; the state of emergency was extended for six more months in november			0
but despite the heightened presence of security forces in those states , the @entity22 insurgency has worsened			0
@entity127 reported on saturday that more than 1,500 people were killed because of fighting between @entity23 militant groups and the government in the first three months of 2014 , a total greater than in all of 2013			0
continuing this trend , 19 people were killed and more than 60 were injured in a car bombing in an @entity12 suburb on thursday			0
( no group has claimed responsibility for that bombing , but it occurred in the same area as a @entity22 attack that killed at least 70 people on april 14			2
) initially , @entity36 downplayed the @entity22 threat , calling the situation " temporary " and arguing that the @entity3 security forces were winning the battle against the militants			2
but after international criticism and domestic outrage , @entity36 has called for an investigation into the mass kidnappings of the girls in april and has said he is open to receiving foreign assistance			0
@entity22 : the essence of terror some of this assistance will be coming from the @entity79 , with a @entity79 official telling @entity157 that : " you are going to see a focus on this in all three channels of government : diplomatic , intelligence and military			2
" adding to the growing frustration within @entity3 over the abductions are reports that @entity168 , @entity3 's first lady , bizarrely ordered the arrest of two of the leaders of the protests that had erupted after the kidnappings of the girls in april , and had even denied the kidnappings had taken place			2
@entity168 's office has denied the reports , but she was quoted by the @entity178 of @entity3 as saying , " you are playing games			0
do n't use schoolchildren and women for demonstrations again			0

@entity22 leader says it has kidnapped more than 200 girls in @entity3
@entity188 : @entity3 is just about to host a world economic conference
he says the terror group 's actions jeopardize @entity7 's largest economy
@entity196 : @entity22 has n't formalized ties to @entity78 , but it could threaten *westerners*
