@entity0 , @entity1 -- police in the @entity1 city of @entity6 have opened a murder case against the owner of a garment factory where a fire killed more than 250 people this week , a senior police official said thursday			1
also under investigation are the two sons of the factory owner , whose name is @entity16 ; the managers of the factory ; the shareholders of the factory ; and any government official who failed to enforce safety regulations at the factory , said @entity24 , a senior @entity6 police official			1
the announcement means police officers will investigate the fire -- one of the worst industrial accidents in @entity1 's history -- gather evidence and submit their findings to prosecutors who will then decide whether to charge the individuals			2
@entity24 said police have opened a murder case because the exit doors of this factory were locked , preventing many people from escaping the blaze that swept through the building during tuesday night and continued to burn wednesday			1
nobody has been arrested in the case yet			2
police officers are still looking for @entity16 and his sons , who are believed to be " hiding , " @entity24 said			2
other charges in the case may eventually include causing bodily harm , negligence and destruction of property , he added			0
at this phase in the investigation , police do not have to name all of the accused			0
that 's why they 're not identifying any government officials or factory managers at this point			0
earlier thursday , @entity6 authorities lowered the death toll from the blaze to 258 from 289 previously			1
the higher toll reported wednesday became inaccurate because of the rapidly rising number of deaths and confusion amid multiple rescue and recovery operations , according to @entity6 fire department chief @entity68 and @entity69 , a local government official			1
@entity68 said the latest death toll is based on the number of bodies and remains recovered from the factory			1
several people are still missing and recovery crews are working to find them			0
@entity68 said investigators are still trying to establish what caused the fire			0
