-- why did he do it ? that 's what so many of us are asking after @entity6 , a popular freshman , opened fire on classmates during lunch at @entity10 north of @entity11 on friday			1
the shootings left two girls dead and three other students injured , including two of @entity6 's cousins , one of whom remains in critical condition			1
@entity6 died after turning the gun on himself			1
we typically assume that school shooters fit the narrative of a loner , struggling to fit in , ostracized and bullied by his peers			1
but by all accounts , @entity6 was well - liked , a member of the football team who planned to try out for wrestling too and who was recently named the school 's freshman homecoming prince			1
what made him snap ? we do n't know and may never know , but as reports come in that @entity6 might have been dealing with a breakup or anger that a girl he liked rebuffed him and was with his cousin , we have to ask ourselves whether we are doing enough to help our boys deal with difficult emotions and express them without resorting to violence			1
@entity6 , it seems , was using social media to express some of the pain he appeared to be feeling			1
@entity49 school shooting forgives the gunman -- his cousin " tell me what your plan is , " he wrote on @entity51 at the end of august			1
" you ca n't make a bond with anyone like the bond me and you have right now ...			0
tell me what your going to do			0
" he went on to say , " your gon na piss me off ... and then some ( expletive 's ) gon na go down and i do n't think you 'll like it			0
" days before the shooting , he wrote , " it breaks me ... it actually does ... i know it seems like i 'm sweating it off ... but i 'm not			0
. and i never will be able to			0
" " it 's a cry for help , " said @entity68 , who wrote a story for @entity70 on the @entity49 tragedy headlined " school shootings , @entity74 and ' @entity72			1
' " " this kid was hurting , but do we have a safe space for young men to feel ok talking about their feelings without fear of repercussion , whether that 's teasing , even if it 's gentle ribbing ? " asked @entity77 , editor of the motherhood anthology " @entity79			1
" emotional literacy in boys type " emotional literacy for boys " into @entity91 , and " @entity92 : protecting the @entity94 " is the first item that will pop up			1
coincidentally , the book came out just days before the @entity96			0
co-author @entity97 says the " cultural ideal of masculinity , " the thinking that men need to be strong and independent , is causing many boys and young men to have trouble bearing difficult emotions			1
@entity74 , mental illness and guns : a lethal equation ? " teenage boys still have the myths , " @entity97 said			1
" they still believe in the myths of total strength and independence , and when your girlfriend ( drops ) you and you are flooded with feelings of loss , shame and abandonment , then you think you ca n't manage these feelings			2
" and that 's where the issue of emotional literacy comes in , because emotional literacy means being able to identify your feelings and being able to manage them , " said @entity97 , a clinical psychologist who works at a boys school in @entity124			1
" @entity140 , " to be released in 2015 , is a film about the impact that our " narrow definition " of masculinity is having on boys , men and society in general			1
the experts interviewed for the film say " that boys have been socialized in such a way that they 're not supposed to experience pain or suffering and that they 're expected to be dominant , stoic and in control at all times , " said @entity148 , the film 's writer , producer and director			1
she also wrote , produced and directed the documentary " @entity158 , " which examined the role of the media in the underrepresentation of women in power			2
" if young men do not have an outlet for expressing their feelings and communicating honestly and outwardly with others , they are subject to an incredibly lonely and isolating existence , " said @entity148 , who is also the founder and chief executive officer of the non-profit @entity160			2
the numbers paint a portrait of frustration and despair that can lead to extreme behavior : eighty - one percent of completed suicides among young people ages 10 to 24 are by boys , according to the @entity175			2
although girls attempt suicide twice as often , @entity97 said , they typically leave notes or take pills , whereas boys often " get a gun or hang themselves or they jump off a bridge			2
" " why are they doing that ? " @entity97 asked			0
" well , they feel they have to do something that looks strong			0
' i 'm hurt but i 'm still strong			0
i can leap off a bridge			0
' they do what in many ways is the final test of masculinity			2
" what more can we do to help boys ? @entity148 believes a conversation is necessary among parents , guardians , educators and coaches and young men , allowing boys to know that " there is more than one way to ' be a man			1
' " sos for stressed - out teens " we have to redefine healthy masculinity for our boys to include empathy , emotion , care and compassion , " she said			1
" and we have to model it , challenging unhealthy dominant norms in public culture and daily life			0
" @entity97 said that as we see an increase in fathers ' involvement in their sons ' lives , people 's idea of masculinity will change			2
" if your father is diapering you from the get - go and taking care of you and bathing you and feeding you , then you do n't think masculinity is just a ' tough thing			2
' " he also said we should think about encouraging our boys to take on caretaking positions , just like girls do , in terms of babysitting or helping the elderly			2
" meeting the needs of somebody who 's dependent allows you to become more accepting of your own dependency needs , " he said			0
do modern dads get enough credit ? parents need to talk to their boys , but too often they are n't using the right words , said @entity97			1
" they 're often saying ' be in touch with your emotions ' ... ' embrace your inner femininity , ' and men experience that as they are being told to be more like women , and they reject it , and teenage boys do especially			1
" dad : no ' be a man ' narrative in home @entity255 of @entity256 , who has two sons and a daughter , said he has always tried to help his sons understand what they are feeling by " literally saying to them , ' you 're feeling frustrated / anxious / nervous / hurt right now , but i promise that feeling will go away			2
' " " as a dad , we are obligated to take our sons by the hand and make sure they are as familiar with their emotions as they are with healthy eating habits , the importance of exercise and sexuality , " said @entity255 , an award - winning author , radio host and creator of the site @entity268			2
@entity278 , father of two boys who are 4 and 7 , said the " be a man " narrative is not present in their home			0
" there are not stereotypical gender roles in the house , " said @entity278 , of @entity284 , @entity285 , who founded a blog called @entity287			0
" i am an active and engaged parent and do n't feel the need to berate masculinity into them			0
" @entity294 , a divorced father of three , says he has spent a lifetime dealing with his own emotions and trying to find ways to deal with them effectively			0
when it comes to his younger son , who is 26 , he believes he has been dealing with the " being tough " issue since the boy started playing hockey when he was 5			0
" they fall or get hit and are told ' be tough ' or ' get back out there , ' " @entity294 said			0
" as a parent and a former athlete , i wanted him to find a balance , not let little things stop him but also not to try and keep playing if he really was hurt			0
" @entity294 said he tried to strike a balance with his son with emotional issues too -- " what to share and what to hold inside " -- and to this day tries to initiate conversations with his son " to open the doors to him expressing his feelings			0
" @entity77 , who has a 7 - year - old son , says they play the song " it 's alright to cry " from the hit ' 70s album " free to be ... @entity326 " all the time in their household			0
" it 's such a simple concept but one that gets lost to boys as they grow up , " she said			0
she wishes middle and high schools would focus as much on emotional development as many elementary schools do , where the goal is giving boys tools on how to work out feelings , just like they have tools for math and language arts			1
" it 's just padding up their tool belt so they have more things to go to before it boils over and it turns into any number of these tragedies			0
" how much do the you think the " be a man " messaging in society is hurting our boys and young men ? tell @entity354 on @entity51 or @entity355 on @entity356 .			1
