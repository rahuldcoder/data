@entity0 , @entity1 -- limited investment options in @entity1 means real estate has been a popular choice for consumers looking to expand their portfolios			1
this , in turn , has helped push @entity1 's housing prices through the roof but many argue that it 's unstoppable , unstable , overpriced and in some cases , even corrupt			1
those hoping to buy should expect to pay a hefty price			2
in the final months of 2013 , home prices in major cities were running about 10 % higher than the previous year			2
to cool the housing market , the @entity1 government has initiated a campaign to build 36 million affordable homes by 2015			1
i traveled to @entity0 recently on a program organized by @entity26 - based think tank , @entity25 , to find out whether this policy has room to succeed			1
the city was the scene of an unusual protest in september last year			2
a @entity1 man walked into a housing exposition with six crabs tied to a string , each one bearing a sticker			1
it was n't done for laughs			2
the @entity0 resident was voicing his anger at developers whom he called " crawling crabs			1
" pictures shared online on @entity44 , @entity1 's equivalent of @entity45 , showed the writing on the stickers -- each one read " high housing prices " and " high land prices			1
" this was n't a protest you would normally associate with @entity1 but it 's a complaint that is gaining more and more traction in @entity0 and one i heard many times during this trip to the capital of @entity60 in eastern @entity1			1
demand for homes driving through this city of eight million people , i found it hard to believe that housing is an issue here			1
on every street there is a protected wall of construction -- and that 's at street level			2
look up and towering above is skyscraper after skyscraper			2
despite the speed of urbanization , there are not enough homes for everyone			2
it 's easy to understand why : workers are leaving the suburbs and rural areas to seek a new life in the bright lights of the city			2
as a consequence , demand has pushed house prices to rise as high as the expanding skyline			1
according to @entity1 's @entity95 , prices for homes in the largest cities have seen an even steeper rise			1
in december , home prices in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 increased by 16 % to 20 % over the previous year			1
in @entity0 , prices have increased by 15.6 %			1
some economists say runaway growth in this sector is the biggest threat to @entity1 's economic stability			1
many , like the crab protester , " have lost their faith or their trust of the government in controlling the real estate price , " @entity106 , a senior partner at @entity107 said			0
to boost the supply to middle - income families , and in many ways calm discontent over lack of affordable property in cities like @entity98 , the government has implemented measures it argues will help to curb house prices			1
among the measures : higher stamp duties and restrictions on the number of homes individuals can own			0
@entity98 also promised penalties for local governments that do not curb prices , saying officials " will be held accountable " in the event of failure			1
during my visit , i saw little sign of a cooling market			2
those i met felt it was practically impossible to buy a house in the city			0
i talked with a small group of the four million recent graduates who are struggling to get on the property ladder			0
out of the ten i met , only one has been able to buy a home			0
another , who wants me to call him @entity152 , tells me he desperately wants to buy			0
but for an average worker , it will take five to ten years of savings for a deposit			0
for a farmer , perhaps even 20 years , @entity152 added			0
to help correct the imbalance between supply and demand and ease the burden on the big cities and more importantly the financial burden on its people , the @entity1 government finished building four million units of affordable housing by the end of september , according to the @entity170			1
visiting an affordable housing complex in @entity0 , since 2002 more than 90 affordable housing projects have been allocated			1
and on the ground , it 's full power ahead with construction			0
@entity177 , the chief engineer of the @entity178 , told me the municipal government of @entity0 has built 9.66 million square meters of new affordable homes			1
i traveled some 45 minutes from the city center to see one of the projects for myself			0
from far away , the government 's commitment looks good			0
a closer inspection gave me a somewhat different view			0
the place i visited is called @entity191 venture park project in the @entity193 district			0
high rise buildings practically touch shoulders -- it 's a clinical , even soulless environment			0
the only bit of color seems to pop from the nurseries surrounding it ; their faÃ § ade still being painted during my visit			0
i took an elevator to the fourth floor to see one of the apartments			0
as i entered , a flat - screen tv blasted a @entity1 war movie , and adorning one of the shelves was a tiny statue of chairman @entity213			1
the owner , identified as mr. @entity215 , told me he received compensation for moving out of his home in the city center			0
despite his forced move , and with officials listening to his every word , he told me he 's happy here			0
he does n't even flinch when he 's asked by another journalist whether his hour - long commute to work is worth the relocation			0
back outside in the communal area , i bumped into a retired worker called @entity213 and his grandson			0
@entity213 told me through a translator that he 's been living here for a month because the house where he lived in the center of @entity0 was torn down to make way for commercial buildings			1
in return , he was given an apartment , some cash and was told where he would be living			0
no one asked him where he wished to reside			0
despite the picture officials want to portray here of community and generosity , there was definitely a feeling of abandonment and isolation			0
not surprising really , there are few buses here , it takes an hour to get to the city center and just the same to get to a hospital			0
risk of corruption the campaign to build 36 million affordable homes by 2015 is seen as a centerpiece of @entity98 's strategy to cool its red - hot property market			1
but from my visit and interactions it seems to have been quite a long way from being a success			0
not only has it , and other measures , failed to stem rising property prices -- some have linked the scheme to corruption , with many arguing that only those with connections can obtain affordable homes at a fair price			1
in january last year , it was reported in @entity1 that @entity277 , the director of a municipal housing bureau in the city of @entity280 was detained and accused of illegally owning some 29 properties , 11 of which were affordable houses owned by his daughter			1
this is just one case			0
@entity1 's @entity287 says it has discovered local governments mismanaging around $ 465 million set aside for these buildings last year			1
i put a question about corruption to @entity0 's party secretary @entity293			1
" would you agree your policy in curbing property prices has not succeeded and that instead become a hotbed for corruption ? " i asked			2
the party secretary admitted they face many challenges			0
" i do not deny that the real estate industry has corruption especially where there 's an imbalance between supply and demand			2
but i do not think corruption is the root cause of high house prices , " @entity293 said			2
instead , he looked at the infancy of @entity1 's real estate market			1
" its uniqueness is that our market only began 30 years ago , when we started reforms			2
that means that it has n't matured enough , " he said			0
@entity98 - based economist @entity321 from @entity322 told me the government urgently needed to implement stronger property control measures			1
one of the challenges is at a local level -- some district authorities have been accused of auctioning off land , and in many cases resisting or circumventing @entity98 's efforts to cool down the market			1
by selling land at such a high price , the government risks facing a higher cost of living , construction and labor , and that , @entity177 argued , will undermine competitiveness , leading to a property bubble			0
@entity340 , director for the @entity341 at the @entity342 also pointed to this controlled supply			0
" land supply is strictly controlled by government and land cost is an important driving force of house bubble , " he said			0
the central government can argue that it 's doing its part to control high inflation , skyrocketing prices and is in the midst of a nationwide clamp down on corruption			2
it can even proudly state that it 's being socially just in providing affordable homes for many			2
right now that will do little to soothe the concerns faced by the @entity0 crab protester and many others like him whose home ownership dream remains a far - off fantasy			1
