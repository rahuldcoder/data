-- with lights , floats and flying , @entity1 kicked off the opening ceremony in @entity6 as the world turns its attention to the costliest @entity9 in history			1
spectators from all over the world watched the introduction of athletes that marked the official start of the @entity17			2
light shows and music , lots of it , filled the air , starting at exactly 8:14 p.m. local time , or 20:14 in military time			0
" most of the ceremony focuses heavily on @entity1 classical music , " said @entity25 , the main creative producer of the ceremony			1
" unfortunately , unlike @entity30 , we can not boast a plethora of famous world - known pop performers			0
this is why we are now focusing on what @entity1 is best known for musically around the world ; namely , classical music			1
" the celebration opened with a dream sequence of a little girl , who imagined all of the letters in the @entity1 alphabet , each letter recalling a @entity1 writer , artist or landmark			1
then the girl , rigged with wires , flew into the air and floated dreamlike over floats that depicted @entity1 landscapes			1
despite anxiety about terror strikes , controversy over gay rights and ridicule for poor preparations , the nation 's officials have maintained that the sites in @entity6 are secure			1
it will be " the safest place on @entity63 during the @entity17 , " said @entity64 , head of the @entity9			1
@entity1 president @entity65 , who pushed the @entity66 to hold the @entity9 in the nation , attended the ceremony			1
the opening ceremony was the only event scheduled for the day			2
about 40,000 people watched from the stands at @entity73 in @entity6			1
@entity1 classical music star @entity74 performed the @entity9 anthem			1
a day before , high excitement marked qualification events in the men 's and women 's slopestyle , women 's moguls and team figure skating			0
security @entity1 has drafted 37,000 police and security officers to handle security in @entity6 , but that has not done much to assuage fears			1
@entity90 hijacking : a @entity90 jetliner signaled a hijacking and landed in @entity94 on friday after a passenger said a bomb was on board and told crew members to take the plane to @entity6 , @entity90 officials said			1
a suspect is reportedly in custody , and authorities are searching the plane for explosives			1
toothpaste terror : a day after the @entity108 warned of how explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes , its government thursday temporarily banned all liquids , gels , aerosols and powders in carry - on luggage on flights between the @entity108 and @entity1			1
@entity108 partnership : @entity108 authorities are working with @entity1 and other countries to try to disrupt several possible threats , including the toothpaste tube concern , a @entity108 intelligence source said thursday			1
the threats vary in credibility , and the biggest one traces to the group @entity129 in @entity1 , which has publicly said its followers will try to disrupt the @entity9 , the official said			1
" the threat stream is credible , i think it 's real , " said sen. @entity131 , @entity132			2
private protection : the @entity108 ski and snowboarding team has hired a private security firm , @entity138 , to provide protection			0
it 's not clear how much the firm could do in the event of a major incident when @entity1 forces will be in charge			1
but it has been gathering intelligence on the ground and will provide an extra layer of protection as athletes travel around			0
ships for safety : two @entity154 ships have steamed into the @entity155 , where they will be ready to help if any mass evacuation of @entity108 citizens is needed			0
@entity108 security officials are working with their @entity1 counterparts to keep the @entity9 safe against the backdrop of a regional separatist movement that has threatened to use terrorism at the @entity9			1
targets of threats : @entity108 are not the only ones who are jittery			0
@entity168 said two of its female athletes had been the target of specific threats			0
@entity168 media reported that an anonymous letter was sent warning @entity177 skier @entity176 and skeleton racer @entity178 they could be kidnapped			0
we 've heard it before : it 's not the first time security issues have dominated the buildup to the @entity17			0
@entity185 parked missile batteries on apartment block roofs and a warship on the @entity189 before the @entity190			0
the @entity191 in 2002 were held amid heightened security only months after the 9/11 terror attacks in the @entity108			0
and in 1996 , the @entity194 in @entity195 were subject to a terror attack			0
preparations when @entity1 bid to host its first @entity17 in 2007 , a document quoted an expected cost of around $ 12 billion			1
that figure has ballooned to around $ 50 billion			0
that 's more than four times over budget and surpasses the cost of @entity207 's @entity206 -- making it the most expensive @entity17 ever , summer or winter			0
@entity1 had less than seven years to transform what was a fairly low - key seaside resort town into a @entity17 venue			1
the project required staggering feats of engineering in building a new freeway and rail link up a mountain , and a ski resort on the top			0
and yet questions about @entity6 's readiness have dogged the final run - up to the @entity9			1
not quite there : while the sports facilities were completed in good time , journalists and others arrived in @entity6 this week to find that some of the 40,000 new hotel rooms were far from ready and that construction workers were still hard at work on parts of the @entity232			1
thanks to pictures of chaotic scenes posted on @entity237 , @entity1 's pride has not been spared			2
but @entity0 's @entity238 in @entity6 reports that the picture is not all bad			2
his hotel has been " superb , " and staff and @entity9 volunteers are clearly making an effort to be helpful and speak @entity244 , he said			2
while some media hotels and landscaping projects have not been completed on time , the sporting venues all look to be in very good condition , he said			0
protests every @entity17 has protests			0
but thanks to social media , @entity1 is facing a global backlash			2
what got many people riled was @entity1 lawmakers ' passage last summer of legislation known as the anti-gay propaganda bill			2
the law makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality			0
open letter : more than 200 writers from around the world signed an open letter published thursday in the @entity185 newspaper @entity269 , calling for a repeal of laws that have placed a " chokehold " on the right to free expression in @entity1			2
" as writers and artists , we can not stand quietly by as we watch our fellow writers and journalists pressed into silence or risking prosecution and often drastic punishment for the mere act of communicating their thoughts , " the letter said			0
designated site : there is a designated protest site in @entity6			2
but there 's been criticism of organizers ' decision to tuck it away in a hard - to - reach village 7 miles ( 11 kilometers ) from the main @entity232			0
more protests may be yet to come -- perhaps even by athletes -- despite an @entity297 rule that bans demonstrations in any @entity9 sites and other areas			2
@entity0 's @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			0
