@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 stepped off the @entity4 early friday and into the arms of her anxious parents , bringing to an end the nightmarish journey aboard a crippled ship that was towed to port days after it was due			1
it was a big , tight hug between 18 - year - old @entity3 and her mom and dad , the kind filled with the emotion that reflected the days of uncertainty after the cruise ship was left virtually dead in the water after a reported engine fire knocked out power			1
" just to be with them , just to let them know i 'm safe , " @entity3 said , fighting back tears			2
" it means just so much to be with them ... you have no idea			2
" my celebration trup on the @entity4 : from joy to misery a near party - atmosphere abounded aboard the cruise ship as it docked late thursday at the @entity34 , where some passengers hung over balcony rails , while others danced and waved signs			1
" i kissed the ground when i got off , " said @entity3 of @entity39 , @entity40 , just north of @entity41			2
the saga began unfolding early sunday morning as the @entity4 , originally carrying 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members , was making its way to @entity47 , @entity48 , when a fire left the vessel listing to the side and drifting in the @entity52			1
the ship drifted nearly 90 miles before enough tugboats arrived to tow the massive cruise ship to @entity0			1
almost immediately , reports emerged on social media of deteriorating conditions aboard the ship			2
passengers reported sewage sloshing in the hallways and , in some cases , running down the walls of cabins			1
still others said the power outage forced people , especially those in the lower decks or inside cabins , to drag their mattresses to outside decks because of stifling heat			2
the power outage also made it impossible for passengers to call loved ones			1
why did it take five days ? for those who were able to get messages out -- drafting on wireless from cruise ships dropping supplies -- it was a few moments to reassure loved ones they were ok			0
still , for @entity3 and others there was nothing better than being able to put both feet on firm ground while wrapping their arms around family members			1
" the unknown was the worst part , " @entity3 mother , @entity94 , said			0
about 75 families were on hand , according to a spokesman for the @entity100 , at the @entity34			1
family members who spoke to @entity2 said they had come from @entity40 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity48			1
some had come in as early as wednesday but the bulk of people arrived thursday afternoon , with each hour bringing a few more cars			1
after a bad cruise , can you cruise into court ? most of the anxious families could n't bear the thought of their relatives being on a bus for hours and had gotten hotel rooms in @entity0 where the homecoming would include a long shower and a meal			0
@entity120 , 18 , got off the ship scanning the crowd for father and brother , who had driven from their @entity126 , @entity127 , home to get them and bring them home			0
there in the crowd , she and her mother , who was traveling with her , found the family			1
her father picked her up in a tight hug , and @entity120 started to cry			0
" i said i do n't have a boyfriend			0
... i sure hope somebody who missed me is there waiting for me , " she said , her eyes red from tears			0
video : passengers spell out help for others , it will be a little longer before they connect with loved ones			2
@entity148 and @entity149 , both 24 , got off the ship cheering and dancing			0
@entity149 went so far as to lay kneel down and kiss the ground			0
" we won this cruise at a @entity156 game			0
lucky us , " @entity148 said , laughing			0
they are among the many who boarded one of the more than 100 motor coaches that were reserved by @entity4 to take them to @entity161 where many will overnight before continuing their journey home			1
the two are headed home to @entity168			0
but that 's ok with the @entity148 and @entity149 because they have " land under our feet			0
" spate of fires hits cruise industry @entity2 's @entity176 and @entity177 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity178 wrote from @entity179 .			0

new : a number of passengers boarded buses for @entity161
@entity185 was *reunited* with her family at the @entity34
