@entity0 -- more than 100 people who lost their homes in a fire that devastated @entity6 's @entity5 during @entity7 last fall have filed a lawsuit against the power companies they claim are responsible , according to their attorney			1
the fire , which destroyed 126 homes and damaged 22 in the @entity13 neighborhood , began when rising sea water came into contact with the electrical system of a home around 8:30 p.m. on october 29 , according to the @entity18 @entity0			1
the fire was not brought under control until around 6:30 the next morning because the storm surge flooding kept firefighters out of the area			1
fueled by hurricane - force winds , the fire quickly spread from home to home , @entity23 said in a press release in december			1
the lawsuit argues that @entity29 and @entity30 should have shut off power to their neighborhood , in the @entity0 borough of @entity34 , before the bad weather hit , as they did with @entity36 , just off the south shore of @entity6			1
@entity38 wants to spend billions on storm , climate change " had @entity29 and @entity30 acted responsibly in preparing for the storm , my clients would be living in their homes with all of their life 's possessions , and these two communities would not look like a war zone , " the plaintiffs ' attorney , @entity41 , said in a statement released tuesday			1
@entity50 , 35 , lost the restaurant his family had owned for 33 years in the fire			2
a firefighter who has lived in the @entity5 his whole life , @entity50 was also one of the men fighting the fires in @entity13 that night			0
his second - floor condo in the area that overlooks the beach was safe by just inches , he said			0
" i just want not a penny more , not a penny less than what it costs to rebuild , " @entity50 said			0
although the lawsuit does not seek a specific dollar amount , the damages to the area exceeded $ 80 million , and continue to rise since none of the 120 clients have been able to begin rebuilding , @entity41 said			0
@entity7 relief : the need continues @entity50 said his insurance claim covered only about a quarter of the $ 2.5 million to $ 3 million it would cost to rebuild his business			1
he , along with his brother , father and business partner , had paid off the mortgage to the restaurant 15 years ago , he said			0
" we should n't have to pay another mortgage again for something that could have been prevented , " he said			0
" electricity and salt water is a deadly combination , we would have thought the power companies knew this already , " @entity41 said			2
@entity29 officials stood by their actions in a written statement			2
" while we are sensitive to those families and individuals who suffered tragic losses from @entity7 , the effort to place fault for this tragedy with the utility is misplaced , " the statement says			1
@entity41 , who is from the @entity5 area , said the issue has become very personal for him			0
" we all watched those fires rage during the storm and were standing in front of the homes that were reduced to smoldering ash and rubble the next morning , trying to make sense of why this was allowed to happen , " he said			2
weather disasters cost $ 110 billion in 2012			0
