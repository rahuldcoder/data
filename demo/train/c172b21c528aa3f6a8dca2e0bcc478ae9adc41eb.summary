-- it seems a certainty that the biggest headlines coming out of tuesday night 's @entity0 debate in @entity5 will be about race , gays , religion or immigration			1
it has to be , because only @entity11 is gaining any traction on @entity13 , and it is as much for his freshness as it is for his ideas			1
last week , both @entity13 and @entity11 showed they were going to own the debate on the economy			1
little air was left for anyone else on the subject			0
and this week 's @entity0 / @entity25 poll shows that it worked for them			0
so how do the others gain ? by challenging them on the old standby @entity30 primary issues : those of the social order , of course			0
given the stuff that @entity11 has said -- that he would n't hire a @entity36 , he wants to zap immigrants like bugs if they try to get over the wall from @entity40 , and blacks only vote for @entity42 because they are brainwashed -- there is plenty of fodder to rile him up			1
not because most @entity30 primary voters do n't agree with him , but because his inflammatory messages will ricochet differently in the media if he repeats them as a front - runner			0
on an anti-gay scale of one to 10 , with @entity55 and @entity56 registering zero and everyone else but @entity58 earning perhaps a two , only @entity13 has flipped - flopped up and down the scale			2
we now know that @entity55 's small business -- which she co-owns with her husband and is always touting -- is actually a clinic that takes people 's money with a promise to cure them of homosexuality			2
perhaps it would work equally well to cure @entity13 of his hatred of his own views about gays			2
and @entity13 has just as scratchy a record on abortion			2
@entity74 is a touchy place to debate immigration			1
the large @entity78 population votes mostly @entity42 , and the state has long depended on immigrant labor			1
and we saw from @entity83 's failed race for the @entity84 in 2010 that immigrant bashing might get headlines , but it does n't get enough @entity74 votes			1
i predict that tuesday night , the candidates will go for the headlines			0
then there is the third rail of religion			0
what will @entity11 trip up on tonight ? hiring @entity36 ? vying with @entity95 to be the best at avoiding a defense of @entity13 's freedom of religion ? can @entity95 get into the conversation at all ? or is he really bearing too much resentment from being brutalized by his opponents for his evangelical @entity103 faith , as his wife recently said ? he is sure to challenge @entity11 and @entity13 's credentials to represent the evangelical and tea party wings of the @entity30			1
yes , tuesday night 's debate is going to matter wednesday , mostly because of the issues that divide the @entity110 let the red meat be thrown			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity114 .			0

@entity114 : @entity13 and @entity11 seemed to own the debate on the economy last time
@entity114 : what 's left for others to gain traction on : race , religion , homosexuality , immigration
@entity74 is a touchy place to debate immigration , with a large @entity78 population , she says
@entity114 : @entity95 might challenge others ' credentials to represent evangelical *christians*
