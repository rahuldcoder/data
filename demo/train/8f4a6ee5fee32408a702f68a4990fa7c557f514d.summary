you 've got answers , " the students marched to the governor 's mansion , promising to stay until @entity1 changed his mind			1

" mr. governor , with all due respect , we will be here all night , all day tomorrow until you apologize or rescind that recommendation			0
" appearing in a gray sweatshirt , @entity1 addressed the crowd through a megaphone outside the mansion , thanking them for caring and coming out			2
" i want the best thing for @entity5			2
i want the best thing for the @entity5 family			2
i want the best thing for the great state of @entity2 , " the governor told students , although not conceding to their wishes			1
earlier , @entity1 had told the chairman of @entity5 's board of trustees , @entity42 , that he felt the board should take further action against university president @entity45 when it meets monday , the statement said			1
the governor also " placed a call " to @entity45 to notify him of these conversations			2
" i think it 's in his best interests ( to ) make sure that there is no question that this university is doing the right thing and cooperating , " @entity1 said thursday			1
the discussions came after @entity1 returned thursday from a trade mission to @entity58 and was briefed by staffers on recent developments out of the @entity62 university , according to the governor 's office			1
@entity45 responded thursday that he was " sure that this investigation will determine that , under my leadership , the administration acted appropriately			1
" at the same time , he said he was prepared to accept his fate			0
" i serve at the pleasure of the @entity5 board of trustees , and i will abide by whatever decision the board reaches , " he said			1
@entity42 also released a statement in which he acknowledged " a communication with the governor			0
" he said he had n't talked with other trustees , promising that " we will make a decision about how we move forward monday			1
" " this is a very difficult decision that we are facing , " @entity42 said			1
the band 's director , @entity81 , has been placed on administrative leave			0
one trustee , @entity84 , advocated a week ago that the university president should likewise be suspended -- but , instead , the board voted then to reprimand him			0
" if you can place ... @entity81 on administrative leave pending an investigation outcome , then we as a board can place @entity45 on administrative leave , procedure-wise , " @entity84 said december 8			1
the school president had pledged wednesday to " root out this culture of hazing , " though he declined to offer details about what specifically might change			2
band drum major @entity99 , 26 , died after a november 19 football game following a suspected hazing incident			1
he " reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe , " authorities said in a statement			0
he was taken to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead			0
no cause of death has been released			0
some band members said he may have died after a rite of passage called " crossing @entity111 " one member , who spoke on condition of anonymity , explained that members " walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus back backward while the bus is full of other band members , and you get beaten until you get to the back			0
" about three weeks before @entity127 's death , freshman band member @entity125 suffered a cracked femur , deep bone bruising and blood clots after being beaten repeatedly on the thighs , according to arrest affidavits from @entity62 police			1
three men -- @entity135 , 23 , @entity136 , 19 , and @entity137 , 22 -- were charged with hazing , a crime under @entity2 law , this week in her case			2
@entity135 and @entity136 additionally are charged with felony battery			0
" we 're sending all these kids off to school			0
... we expect them to come back with an education and alive , " @entity1 said thursday			2
the university 's troubles go beyond the hazing reports			2
@entity152 , commissioner of the @entity153 , said wednesday that authorities looking into @entity127 's death had found evidence of " financial irregularities having to do with the band and several other components of the university			1
" the suspected fraud is not directly related to @entity127 's death , @entity152 said			1
" it became apparent ( from ) some of the people that we interviewed ( that ) the financial irregularities had to do with the band travels and other sports and administrative components of the university , " he said			1
the state commissioner said it is premature to conclude that the irregularities are " systemic , " adding that it is too soon to tell how much money may be involved			0
but , he added , " it 's not just isolated " to the band program			0
in a statement wednesday , @entity42 -- chairman of @entity5 's trustees -- said the university could not comment , " but we are cooperating fully with this and all investigations			1
" the governor said thursday that he is n't advocating that @entity45 resign but rather " step aside " until the investigation is complete			1
ideally , this inquiry will show that whatever problems are " isolated , " he added			0
" my goal is to have a thorough investigation that everybody feels very comfortable that everybody cooperated with , " @entity1 said			2
" hopefully , there was nothing more ( @entity45 ) could do			0
" champions ' parents did not reference @entity45 specifically during an interview , which was conducted with @entity198 's dr. @entity197 before @entity1 made his recommendation			1
yet the young man 's father did state that it was important that there 's accountability -- for both @entity127 's death and hazing in general			1
" i think the school should be held accountable , i think that each organization should be held accountable , " @entity99 said thursday			0
" we have to get down to the root of the problem , so that everyone can be responsible			0
" his wife , @entity127 , said their family will champion anti-hazing education efforts and look into setting up a hotline through which people can anonymously call in reports of hazing			0
she said that everyone at @entity5 -- from administrators , to students , to alumni -- and other schools need to work together to stop hazing , which she called endemic to a larger cultural issue			2
" if you 're not going to be part of the solution , then you are part of the problem , " @entity127 said			0
" the idea is to ( get ) rid of the whole culture , the whole mind - set of it			0
" @entity0 's @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
