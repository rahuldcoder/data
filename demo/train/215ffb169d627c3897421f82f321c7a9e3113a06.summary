-- if you want to stir up a fiery debate -- or maybe even a fist fight -- start talking about air travel and children			0
inevitably , someone will declare that airlines should offer " kid - free flights			1
" while that has yet to happen , @entity9 might have come up with the next best thing			2
a kid - free economy upper deck aboard its first @entity15 service , nonstop between @entity16 and @entity17 , which takes off july 1			1
families traveling with under - 12s --- including babes - in - arms -- will be automatically allocated seats in the main all - economy lower deck , says a @entity9 spokesperson			1
but before we all jump to brand the decision makers at the flag carrier as a bunch of child - hating monsters , the airline is quick to point out that the 350 economy seats on the main deck of its new @entity33 will be enhanced and designated as a family and child - friendly inflight zone			1
and if there 's overwhelming demand for seats in economy class from families with children and infants , resulting in full load in the main deck , " we will still accommodate such demand in the 70 - seat upper deck economy class zone of our @entity15			1
" @entity48 : private jets a new status symbol in @entity51 this is n't the first time @entity9 has instituted a controversial policy relating to kids in the sky			2
last year , the airline decided to ban infants from first class on its 747 - 400 routes			1
the decision won cheers from some -- and words you 'd never say in front of your kids from others			0
given their penchant for boldly going where no airline has dared before , here 's hoping @entity9 ' next move will be to designate a special zone for drunks and passengers who forgot to take a shower before their flight			1
@entity48 : meet the world 's luckiest traveler @entity83 nannies and ' @entity84 ' while @entity9 is the first to ban or segregate the little ones on flights , other airlines do recognize that traveling with young kids on long - haul flights is n't easy			2
several airlines , such as @entity91 and @entity92 , offer passengers free in - flight nanny services that range from helping with meals to entertaining the kids while mom watches a movie			2
in the @entity100 , a new website hooks up fliers with nannies looking to make a few extra bucks			0
called nanny in the @entity105 , passengers can sign up for free and search for potential babysitters scheduled to take the same flight			0
@entity48 : could budget airlines topple @entity110 's legacy carriers ? @entity112 low - cost airline @entity111 , meanwhile , does n't offer nanny services but it did attract a lot of attention earlier this month with a hilarious @entity117 joke			0
on april 1 , the airline launched a video advertising a new service dubbed " @entity121 " in which parents check their kids in with their luggage			0
the parents enjoy the flight , the kids are sent down to their own special club in the cargo hold			0
not a bad idea , really			0
should other airlines follow @entity9 ' lead and designate inflight kid - free zones ? tell us what you think in the comments below			1

@entity9 designates a child - friendly lower - level zone
upper level in economy class on @entity15 route will be child - free
last year , the airline banned infants from first class on its 747 - 400 routes
