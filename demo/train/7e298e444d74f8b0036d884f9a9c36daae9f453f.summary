-- it 's been billed as an astronomical equivalent of the @entity3 , offering new insights into the formation of the universe and so powerful that it might even detect alien life			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) is an international effort to build the world 's largest radio telescope , one which will probe the dark heart of space shedding new light on dark matter , black holes , stars and galaxies			1
" it will have a deep impact on the way we perceive our place in the universe and how we understand its history and its future , " says @entity20 , interim director general of the @entity8 project			1
" we know we are going to discover things that we have n't already			0
it 's going to be very exciting , " van @entity20 said			2
taking its name from the total size of its collecting area , the @entity8 telescope will consist of 3,000 dish antennas , each one around 15 meters wide			1
construction is slated to begin in 2016			2
collectively the surface area of all the dishes will amount to one square kilometer -- hence the name -- all combining to detect radio waves that penetrate the @entity45 's atmosphere , emitted by stars , galaxies and quasars			1
two other types of radio receptors -- aperture antennas and array antennas -- will combine with the dishes to provide continuous frequency coverage from 70 @entity54 to 10 ghz			1
" it 's not like an optical telescope where you see an image of the sky directly			2
what you do is measure signals from the antennas and process them , " van @entity20 says			0
around half the antennas will sit in a " central core region " made up of three separate five - kilometer clusters			0
the remainder will extend out in five carefully aligned " spiral arms " stretching out ever more sparsely over an area in excess of 3,000 kilometers ( 1,864 miles ) or more			2
the configuration , say scientists , will create the most sensitive radio telescope ever built			1
currently , that honor is held by the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) in @entity78 , says @entity79 , from @entity80 -- a leading @entity82 center for astronomical research			0
" ( @entity77 has ) just undergone a very large refit			0
telescopes themselves have n't changed but the computing at the back end has changed dramatically , " @entity79 said			0
see also : mapping out a new era in brain research at the moment , we simply do n't have the computing power for the @entity8 telescope to perform at full tilt , @entity91 says			1
" we 're talking about huge computing hardware that still needs to be developed			0
there 's a big challenge there , " he said			2
supercomputers capable of performing billions and billions of operations per second will be required , but the results will be spectacular , van @entity20 says			0
" we will have high - resolution images where we will actually peer into the center of what is going on in galaxies , " van @entity20 said			0
" we will also have the big picture where we can make surveys of vast areas of the sky to map out the large - scale structure of the universe			2
" the project is entering a crucial stage with an announcement on where the array will be based expected imminently			2
two locations , one in @entity123 's @entity122 , the other in western @entity125 , are in the running			1
@entity127 , project director of the @entity125 / @entity129 bid , extols the virtues of @entity125 's " intrinsic radio quietness " and the " excellent geophysics " of the proposed @entity134 site			1
meanwhile , ska @entity123 project director @entity135 says hosting the " world 's largest science project " would be extremely important to the country and the continent			1
" it could carry immense importance for the perception of @entity123 -- by @entity143 and by the rest of the world , " @entity135 said			1
" it has already attracted a lot of young people into science and mathematics in @entity123 and from other @entity143 countries and it 's attracted a lot of top - rate scientists , " he added			1
recent reports suggest that @entity123 is favorite to host the @entity8 , but van @entity20 would n't be drawn on the matter			1
wherever the location , the effort to build and operate the @entity8 will be an international one , with 20 countries and 70 institutions already on board , as well as private backers			2
and whatever the outcome of the bids , it will be a while before the array is up and running with construction slated to start four years from now and full operation not expected until 2024			1
the total cost is estimated at â ‚ ¬ 1.5 billion ( around $ 2 billion )			0
but it will be money well spent van @entity20 thinks			0
" if it only tells us when the first stars and galaxies formed then it would have already contributed a huge amount to our understanding			0
" it is possibly the most complex experiment we could possibly do			0
it has huge potential for allowing us to determine the distance to every galaxy in our local universe , " @entity79 said			0
" the @entity3 produces a certain amount of data per hour			0
this will produce the same amount of data in the space of a couple of minutes			0

the world 's largest radio telescope will *uncover* *secrets* of the history and future of the universe
extraterrestrial life may also be detected by @entity8 telescope
3,000 dishes will be used in an array which will *spread* over *massive* area
