@entity0 , @entity1 -- every time i talk to a group of @entity6 , i learn another layer of the complex construct that weaves @entity6 society together and complicates any analysis of the conflict			1
talking to @entity6 in @entity1 is no different			1
of three @entity13 representatives i met who live there , two told me they shared tribal ties with @entity1			1
the three were actively campaigning to support the rebels back home			2
guns -- big guns -- were at the top of their wish list in meetings with @entity1			2
although the @entity6 told me they were n't sure any were being sent , i 'd have been surprised , if they told me they were			2
such issues are shrouded in secrecy			0
what did surprise me , however , was the two @entity6 with tribal ties who told me their motivation was to support their own tribes back home			1
other @entity6 , too , they said -- but tribe first			2
the borders of @entity6 , @entity1 , @entity34 and @entity35 were drawn up in 1916 by @entity37 and @entity38 cartographers , indifferent to the realities of tribal life straddling the new lines emerging over the desert sands			1
today those historic tribal ties are paying dividends for @entity6 's rebels			1
the ancestral connections are igniting sympathies among some of the region 's richest people			0
thousands of @entity1 , @entity51 , and @entity52 share tribal kinship with their @entity6 cousins			1
add to tribal sympathies religious conviction			0
most @entity1 are @entity58 , the same as the @entity6 majority who kicked off the uprising			1
it 's little wonder that when the residents of the desert kingdom dipped their hands in their pockets for the @entity6 , they did n't disappoint			1
close to half a billion @entity1 riyals -- almost $ 150 million -- was raised by the end of @entity70 , a 30 - day period of fasting and giving that ended this weekend			1
most of it was given during a five - day telethon , much of the rest deposited in an account in a @entity1 bank			1
the three @entity6 i met told me they do n't know what the money will be spent on , but they do know they wo n't get their hands on it			2
in the post- 9/11 era , @entity1 have cracked down on fund - raising to the point that all cash coming in for @entity6 is tightly controlled by the @entity1 @entity86			1
it 's an attempt to prevent extremist groups like @entity89 from benefiting from @entity1 largesse			1
but that , according to the @entity6 trio , may be hard to enforce			2
@entity13 member @entity92 , who also represents the high council of the @entity94 , explains : " the feeling now inside @entity6 is that those extremists -- they are coming here to help us , ok			1
and this feeling -- it make this extremist my friend , ok			0
so it 's not enemy now , it 's my friend			0
" put simply , whoever gets the aid , be it guns , grain or bandages , will use it as they see fit			0
and if helping their new extremist friends is what it takes to win the fight in the absence of international support , that 's what they 'll do			0
and that 's why these @entity1 - based @entity6 are doing their best to make their aid networks transparent			1
one @entity6 dentist i met , @entity126 , told me he 'd been to @entity128 to learn how to set up a charity			1
he and his friends put together the @entity131 , setting it up with a bank account in @entity133			0
he ca n't take money from @entity1 , but he can work with official registered charity collection organizations			2
" so whomever comes to us , we refer them to those organizations , those relief groups , and they help us , " he explained			0
how they help is quite @entity142 and his colleagues visit medical suppliers and nail the best deal for the goods			0
then " we present those projects to the local or governmental organization , " and the @entity1 government group buys the goods , delivering them to activists in @entity128 , he said			1
by operating within @entity1 law today , @entity126 hopes his medical charity can keep on giving when the time comes to rebuild @entity6			1
he says the group is going to great lengths to make sure it gets what it pays for			0
" we ask for video tapes , for pictures , for some kind of documentation			0
" but he says once supplies cross the border , it 's hard to maintain transparency			0
" we care more about our activists than our money			0
i 'm not willing to lose any activists on the ground , but i am willing to lose a little money			0
" money is n't all the @entity1 seem prepared to give			2
@entity173 and religious ties , @entity126 says , may inspire some to pay the ultimate price			0
what activists in @entity6 are asking for now is not medical supplies , but doctors , he says			2
" i tell the young men who volunteer , ' are you ready not to come back ? ' it 's a life or death decision			0
" even so , he says he 's been told @entity1 will soon start sending medics			2
he 's still waiting to see them show up			0
but he does n't doubt the bonds that shape young men 's minds here are strong enough to overcome their fears .			0

@entity6 ' tribal ties with @entity1 are *fueling* aid to @entity6 rebels
@entity1 government keeps tight rein on aid to @entity6 groups , trying to keep it from extremists
@entity1 - based @entity6 set up charities carefully to stay within the rules
but one says once aid gets to @entity6 , it 's out of their control
