-- well , guess that argument 's settled for now			0
@entity2 is a more valuable brand than @entity4			1
at least that 's the assessment of an annual study by @entity7 , a communications company that ranks @entity2 as the world 's most popular brand , topping @entity4 , which had held the top spot for the past three years			1
and , yes , we realize the report will change virtually no minds in the tech world 's long - running battle of fan loyalty			2
but it 's fun to talk about			0
according to the 2014 @entity20 ranking , @entity2 's brand value rose 40 % last year , to $ 159 billion			1
@entity4 , meanwhile , slipped 20 % to $ 148 billion			1
according to the report , it was @entity2 's spirit of innovation , and @entity4 's perceived lack of it , that led to the flip - flop			1
" i think the world is looking at @entity4 as a brand that created an @entity32 - shattering revolution , and i think that has slowed down a bit , " @entity27 , vice president at @entity7 , told @entity28			1
" the fact that ( @entity2 ) does n't see themselves contained in one sector is really a testament to their boldness and willingness to try new things			2
" in the past year , @entity2 's @entity42 mobile operating system continued to gain popularity worldwide , its connected @entity45 eyewear became more of a wearable - tech staple and stories about its long - range products , like a self - driving car , continued to captivate imaginations			1
all that is in addition , of course , to its search engine , which remains essentially unrivaled			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , was criticized by some for failing to keep breaking new ground , settling instead for incremental upgrades to its breakthrough products like the @entity60 and @entity61			2
long - standing reports suggest that @entity4 has a smartwatch and a television system on the way			1
and the tech giant also is reportedly on the verge of buying headphone and digital - music company beats			2
but there have been no visible results on those fronts			0
the @entity7 list was decidedly tech heavy			0
rounding out the top five were @entity77 , @entity78 and , representing the nontech world , @entity75 's			0
@entity80 , which continues to strengthen its foothold in the streaming - tv and tablet markets , entered the top 10 for the first time			2
@entity85 and @entity86 debuted on the list at numbers 71 and 78 , respectively , and with a 68 % increase in perceived value , @entity89 was the second - biggest climber on the list , reaching number 21			1
of course , it 's always hard to know exactly how much stock should be placed in these research - company rankings			0
as with @entity7 , many of them use proprietary tools and research that they offer to clients for a fee and do n't care to explain to the public			0
the company does say that the rankings came , in part , from 150,000 interviews with consumers from around the world			0
but how did it measure the value of an @entity4 fan 's willingness to sleep on a sidewalk in order to buy a new phone versus the free press @entity2 gets every time it cranks out a really cool doodle for its search page ? nobody knows			1
but , hey , it 's something for diehard fans to debate between now and whenever the @entity125 is announced .			0
