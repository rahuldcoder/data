-- every @entity1 can make their own judgment about whether justice was served by the verdict in the @entity7 murder trial but one thing we should all recognize : president @entity11 's interference in a local law enforcement matter was unprecedented and inappropriate , and he comes away from the case looking badly tarnished by his poor judgment			1
" if i had a son , he 'd look like @entity21 , " the president said when asked about the case in the @entity16 on march 23 , 2012 , after many had called for @entity7 's arrest but several weeks before he was charged			1
" when i think about this boy , i think about my own kids			0
" in fact , if the president had a son , he would have been born to extraordinary privilege and raised with all the advantages of two very affluent and highly educated parents			0
he would have gone to tony private schools			0
his path in life would have been almost as dissimilar from @entity21 's as one could imagine			0
yes , @entity11 's hypothetical son and @entity21 would have shared the same brown skin color			1
would that have made them interchangeable ? not unless all brown - skinned boys are the same			0
does the president really believe that ? the president 's remarks created a clear impression that he was motivated by one of two factors , and we can only guess as to which , or what combination of the two , was at work here			1
one possibility is that this is merely another manifestation of the president 's well - known narcissism : no matter what the situation may be , it 's all about him			1
the other , more troubling possibility is that the president surrendered to his political instincts			0
he wants disadvantaged @entity1 to believe that he and his family are one of them -- despite their life of unparalleled privilege -- and he wanted the prosecutors , judge and jury to believe that this was a case about race where justice demanded a guilty verdict			2
if that was his motivation -- and we can not know , but reasonable people certainly may suspect -- then @entity11 should be ashamed of his effort to stir @entity1 's turbulent , dangerous racial waters			1
the president 's role is not to be a racial agitator , and the mark of a great civil rights leader has been a determination to reject the temptations of that approach			1
and not that long ago -- in 2008 , in @entity83 -- candidate @entity11 distanced himself from such agitators			2
people such as @entity86 and @entity87 see white racism as endemic and elevate what 's wrong with @entity1 over all that is remarkably right			0
in his 2008 @entity83 speech , @entity11 separated himself from activists of their ilk : the very people who today still hope to punish @entity7			1
on the campaign trail , @entity11 understood the sensibilities of the @entity1 people on these questions ; in office , @entity11 seems to have lost that touch			2
on sunday , the president did once again separate himself from the voices of anger			0
" we are a nation of laws and the jury has spoken , " he said			0
but if his @entity111 brings civil rights charges against @entity7 , as the @entity113 has urged and which it is reportedly still considering , the ugly racial politics of this prosecution will be undeniable			1
let us hope it never comes to that , for at that point a double tragedy will have occurred			0
@entity117 will be dead , and our hopes for a president whose judgment is unaffected by his race will have been thoroughly and irreparably dashed			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124 .			2

@entity124 : president @entity11 's 2012 statement on case was a *mistake*
she says @entity11 wrongly *emphasized* role of race in the case
presidents should be above the stance of those who seek to stir racial *tension* , she says
@entity124 : *federal* charges *vs.* @entity7 would *exacerbate* the race issue
