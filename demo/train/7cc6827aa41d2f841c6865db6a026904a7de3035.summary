-- change is never pretty			0
and the change that results when 50 states step in to take on a job @entity5 has tried and failed to do can be especially messy			1
this is what 's happening -- with a vengeance -- on immigration			1
in the past five years , there has been a virtual revolution in immigration lawmaking			1
and the result is not just chaos -- it 's a lot of bad policy			1
states from @entity17 to @entity18 have enacted laws cracking down on illegal immigration			1
some go after the immigrants ; some target the businesses that hire them			0
some rely on local police to do the job ; others require that employers use the federal e-verify system to check the immigration status of employees			1
many of these statutes have been challenged in court , and the decisions that have been handed down are all over the map			0
the most controversial provisions of @entity17 's 2010 immigration law , @entity39 , were put on hold by a federal judge before they could go into effect , and in april the 9th @entity43 upheld that ruling			2
but when @entity47 's similar law , passed in june , came before a federal judge , she came to exactly the opposite conclusion , upholding sections almost identical to those blocked by the @entity52			0
and on friday , the 11th @entity53 @entity43 took yet a third view , blocking some provisions of the @entity47 law but upholding others -- including the section that permits local police to ask about the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons			1
an immigration reform advocate who went to sleep five years ago when @entity64 last tried and failed to pass immigration reform would n't recognize the landscape today			1
the notion that immigration policy is a federal responsibility -- once widely accepted by both parties -- has been shattered , probably forever			1
far from finding state immigration laws unconstitutional -- as many legal experts once insisted -- the @entity74 's may ruling in the @entity75 v. @entity77 case endorsed the principle that states can and should play a significant role in controlling illegal immigration			1
and policies once unthinkable to many are now commonplace			0
a full one - third of the states now require some or all employers to use the federal @entity87 system to check the immigration status of new hires			1
four states have enacted measures modeled on @entity17 's controversial policing law			2
of course , it 's understandable that states are stepping in to grapple with immigration : the system is dysfunctional , and voters want something done			1
the problem is that most state lawmakers respond to this clamor by intensifying state enforcement			2
but critical as enforcement is , enforcement alone wo n't solve the problem			2
to do that , lawmakers need to combine enforcement with fixes to the legal immigration system -- providing enough visas for immigrants who contribute to the economy , create jobs and keep our cities vital while also protecting @entity53 workers			1
and these kinds of fixes are much harder for states to make			2
so instead , most simply crack down harder on the broken system			0
consider what happened this year in @entity47 , the state with the nation 's toughest immigration law			2
the new measure touches nearly every aspect of life in @entity47 : hiring , firing , policing , the criminal justice system , state contracts , schools and religion -- the aim being to make every aspect of life harsher and less hospitable for illegal @entity136 two recent court decisions on the law are not the last word -- there will be many appeals			0
and in the meantime , chaos reigns across @entity47			0
local law enforcement officials are at a loss , unsure who they should asking for immigration papers or where to house those they arrest -- most jails in @entity47 are already full			1
immigrants are fleeing the state in droves -- illegal immigrants but also legal residents who have unauthorized relatives and are afraid to lead police to their doors			0
five percent of @entity160 children have stopped attending school			0
employers -- particularly farmers -- are complaining desperately about labor shortages			0
and fruit and vegetables are rotting in fields across the state			0
is there a silver lining ? at first blush , it 's hard to see one			1
but sometimes things have to get worse before they get better			0
most support tough immigration enforcement , but they can also see the crops rotting not just in @entity47 but also in @entity178 , @entity17 and other states			1
employers and business groups once hesitant to get involved in the debate are coming out of the woodwork to complain about worker shortages			0
and in a few states , this has led to productive dialogue , even , occasionally , a breakthrough			1
in a handful of states , the two parties have put their heads together and considered options for solving the problem			2
in other places , lawmakers have listened to employers when they explained the damage harsh enforcement would do to the economy			2
this ferment bore fruit in several states this year			2
in @entity17 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 , legislators stopped short of passing the most draconian measures on the table			0
and in @entity215 , politicians , business leaders , law enforcement and faith groups came together to enact legislation that went beyond enforcement only -- trying to create a system that works , at least in @entity215			2
the most important part of the @entity215 solution is a state guest - worker program			0
exactly how it will function is controversial -- @entity215 's answer involves unauthorized workers already in the state and others waiting in @entity227 for legal visas			1
but the underlying principle is only common sense : replacing illegal immigrants with a legal foreign work force that employers can turn to when they ca n't find enough willing and able @entity53 workers			1
justice @entity235 called the states the " laboratories " of democracy			2
a lot of what 's going on in those laboratories today is disastrous			0
certainly , in @entity47 , the results look more like a train wreck than science			0
but maybe even that offers some reason for hope			0
after all , even @entity64 can stand by only so long			0
at some point , surely , @entity5 will have to impose order on the chaos spreading in the states			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			1

@entity254 : states grappling with immigration by making own laws have made bad policy
she says feds failed at immigration reform , now states just focus on enforcement
she says more visas for good workers needed as well as ways to protect @entity53 workers
@entity254 : silver lining to bad laws is that they *clarify* need , can help start dialogue about *reality*
