-- suddenly , @entity1 is talking about growth and not just austerity			1
the @entity4 and the @entity5 have followed voters in a series of other @entity1 countries in rejecting a pro-austerity government			1
the @entity5 just denied their ruling parties a majority vote in the parliamentary elections , throwing into question the country 's commitment to structural and fiscal reform			1
and the @entity4 elected @entity17 , who will be @entity4 's first @entity18 president in 17 years			2
@entity19 has a large stake in @entity1 prosperity			1
twenty - two percent of @entity19 exports are sent to @entity1 and the two economies are stitched together with cross-border investments , interdependent capital markets and a shared view of global economic governance			1
our mutual dependence has grown to the point that when either economy catches cold the other one risks more than a mild sniffle			0
the @entity1 elections add a degree of uncertainty for @entity19 companies thinking about investing in slow growth economies			1
but the impact is likely to be short - lived			1
as @entity1 goes through the process of finding a way to combine some growth with long - term deficit reduction , @entity19 exports are likely to suffer			1
as expected , the @entity17 victory and the political upheaval in @entity5 triggered strong reaction from markets around the world			2
@entity1 banks that have been harboring reserves are likely to be even more cautious going forward			2
and again , there is talk of @entity5 having to leave the eurozone			2
but for some time now , calls for growth have been heard from @entity56 to @entity57			0
the @entity59 government suffered recently as it failed to heed calls for policies to foster growth			2
the new emphasis on growth reflects both a political and economic necessity			0
@entity5 has already plunged into high rates of unemployment			0
in @entity68 , the overall unemployment rate is approaching 25 %			0
almost half of younger @entity68 are out of work			0
adding austerity to the mix is simply politically unsustainable in mature democracies , as the election results in @entity4 and @entity5 demonstrate			1
moreover , short - term austerity policy does not revive economic growth			1
just take a look at @entity78			0
there , the fiscal deficits have grown rather than shrink			0
the @entity4 government will be looked over carefully by international investors			2
if @entity4 was to adopt short - term tax cuts or increases in spending , it will likely be met by investors demanding higher interest rates on government bonds , which would constrain the government in its ability to promote growth			1
if @entity4 pursues a stimulus package , investors will want to see not only how much money is spent but also how the money is spent			2
for example , investments in infrastructure , technical education and scientific research should produce very different results than traditional policies of tax cuts and added unemployment compensation			0
what the struggling @entity1 countries should really do is learn some lessons from @entity109 , which has extended the retirement age , made adjustments to the social safety net and kept a tight rein on fiscal deficits			0
but it 's not easy to emulate the @entity109			0
as @entity4 and its neighbors craft out new policies , slow growth in @entity1 will reduce some pressure on global commodity markets , particularly oil			1
that could be a plus for the @entity19			0
but , a decline in @entity19 exports to @entity1 will drag down an already anemic job market at home			1
economic and financial trouble in @entity1 is not good for the @entity19 economy			1
neither is the political turmoil caused by too much austerity imposed too quickly			0
traders will do well with a period of volatility caused by the changes in governments			2
longer - term investors in @entity1 or the @entity19 will be fine as long as they keep their eyes on economic and corporate fundamentals			1
the leaders of @entity4 and @entity109 are expected to meet next week , shortly after @entity17 takes office			0
they have every reason to pursue reasonable policies that will benefit everyone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

@entity4 and @entity5 reject their pro-austerity governments in elections
@entity153 : @entity19 has a large stake in @entity1 prosperity
he says that short - term austerity policies do not revive economic growth
@entity148 : traders will benefit from market volatility , long - term investors will do fine
