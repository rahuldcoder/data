" the 15th birthday , culturally , is a milestone			1
it does n't have to be celebrated with a party at all , but it is generally marked by something quite special , " @entity61 says			0
experts believe the quinceañera is rooted in @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 traditions			2
today , many coming - of - age ceremonies resemble lavish " sweet 16 " celebrations			0
beyond the elaborate apparel , food and festivities , modern quinceañeras often feature a court of 15 people , typically consisting of family and friends			1
as the event continues to grow in popularity , the makeup of the court has also changed			0
" it has gone beyond @entity91 , so that a lot of @entity94 girls will have not only family members in court but they will reach out to @entity98 friends , " says @entity61			2
" so it 's a way of reaching out and extending social ties and bringing people in who might not otherwise have an opportunity to know a @entity94 family and to know the culture			0

she recommends that families manage expectations before the party planning even begins			0
ireporter @entity140 's quinceañera was a big event in @entity143 " sometimes people go way overboard and [ spend ] much more on the celebration than they can afford and that 's the downside of the quinceañera , " says @entity61			1
" because when it 's done right it can be a beautiful family celebration and a celebration of a milestone that a young girl goes through			1
" quinceañeras have changed over the years			2

it was a small gathering at her sister 's apartment with family and friends			0
she wore borrowed jewelry from a family member , had a homemade cake and danced with her father			0

" @entity181 's mother , grandmother never had quinceañeras there 's a spiritual element to these celebrations as well , says @entity61			1
the church plays a role in helping to prepare teenage girls for this transition to womanhood			2

" when it 's done in the spirit that it probably should be , the girl has certain responsibilities and by the end of the process , she 's met them and she has showed her mother that she can , in fact , be responsible and she does acquire ... a bit more maturity then she [ had ] before , " says @entity61			2
as the celebrations become more popular in the @entity56 , they also offer an opportunity for more @entity56 to participate			0
" it 's a way to push back a lot of the negativity that a lot of @entity91 feel is directed at @entity91 , " says @entity61			1
" it is a way for people who have recently arrived , or maybe not so recently arrived , to say ' i have done well here ' ... i 'm throwing this party for my daughter and i 'm inviting all of you to partake of my generosity so that you can see exactly how well we 've done			0
