-- the stars seem to be aligning for immigration reform			1
the election of 2012 scared many republicans into thinking that their increasingly hardline stance on immigration is cutting against big demographic changes			1
these @entity9 fear that they might risk writing themselves off for decades to come , if the @entity9 loses a vital part of the electorate to @entity12			1
a growing number of prominent republicans are coming out in favor of a liberalized immigration policy , including the @entity18 darlings sens. @entity19 and @entity20			1
during a recent speech to the @entity24 hispanic @entity22 , @entity19 said that " immigration reform will not occur until conservative @entity9 , like myself , become part of the solution			1
" @entity12 sen. @entity28 of @entity29 announced that an eight - person bipartisan group will soon reach a deal to move forward in the @entity33			1
so it appears that the opportunity for bold immigration reform has finally arrived			1
but as any observer of congressional history knows , nothing is inevitable on @entity40 , particularly in the current @entity41 , where both parties remain extremely polarized and there are high costs for bucking the party orthodoxy			0
what needs to happen to close a deal ? it is instructive to look back at history when @entity41 passed two landmark civil rights measures : the @entity52 and the @entity53			1
both were highly controversial ; but ultimately , they went through as a result of bipartisan deals			0
even though @entity41 is different in this era -- with both parties deeply divided internally and a closed committee system that dampens the power of party leaders to control members -- those historical struggles offer some instructive lessons for today as to how to seize a great opportunity that emerges			2
the news media have always been a powerful force in our society			2
at times , they have helped push our political system toward reform			2
right now , a new generation of reporters can shine by taking on the biggest stories of the day that would have long - term impact on the direction of our country			2
this is what happened during the early 1960s , when a young generation of print and television reporters brought the nation vivid reports from the front lines of the civil rights struggle			2
in those years , reporters covered the brutal clashes that were taking place in southern cities like @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity95 , showing the nation the reality of race relations			0
when presidential speechwriter @entity100 watched the clashes on his television screen , he instantly understood how the media were transforming the national conversation			2
he noted , " for a century the violence of oppression had been hidden from the sight of white @entity24			0
... but now the simple invention of a cathode ray tube , transforming light into electrons , registering their impact on the magnetic tape , had torn the curtain away			0
and @entity24 did n't like what it saw			0
" similarly , in the new internet age that we live in , the media can offer the nation a better understanding of the plight of immigrants who are living in this country and the kinds of problems that legislation can redress			2
too often , discussions about immigration have revolved around vague and caricatured images			2
in the next few months , young and enterprising reporters can help politicians and voters see why the government needs to resolve this issue and how it can best do so			0
another important lesson from history is the need to reach out to the other side when a rare opportunity comes along			2
in the civil rights debate , president @entity140 depended on the @entity33 minority leader , @entity9 @entity142 of @entity143 , to deliver the votes needed to end a filibuster in 1964			1
in order to get @entity142 on his side , @entity140 told his administration team and congressional leadership to play to @entity142 's ego and sense of history			0
the key was to allow @entity142 to shape the bill , within certain parameters , so that he could leave his imprint on the measure			0
" you get in there to see @entity142 ! " @entity140 told sen. @entity160 , the @entity12 whip who was shepherding the bill through the @entity33			0
" you drink with @entity142 ! you talk to @entity142 ! you listen to @entity142 ! " @entity142 made some important changes to the bill during the negotiations but in the end , he delivered over 20 @entity9 votes , which killed the filibuster			1
@entity140 got what he wanted			0
president @entity170 will need to make the same kind of moves , giving @entity33 minority leader @entity173 some kind of a role so that he can buy into the legislation and win some amount of credit for producing a bill			0
the president will need to do the same in the @entity182 , where speaker @entity183 will play a vital role as he tries to tame the radicals in his caucus			0
while giving either @entity9 such a role might frustrate @entity12 who feel that their party is in command , the results could be powerful			1
immigration rights activists can sit tight as the final months of the debate unfold			1
for all the talk about bipartisanship in the 1960s , the reality was that bipartisanship was often produced when legislators felt immense pressure from the grass roots			1
when the @entity33 debated the civil rights bill in a lengthy filibuster that lasted 60 days in the spring and summer of 1964 , civil rights activists -- who had already forced @entity41 to deal with the issue through a mass march on @entity205 -- conducted protests in states and districts and gathered in @entity205 to lobby members			1
the immigration rights movement has been extremely effective in recent years , and now it must show its chops once again			1
it must also form alliances with other organizations , such as civil rights and gay rights groups , that have indicated they are willing to enter into a broader coalition to support this cause			0
the movement needs to work on legislators who are currently on the fence , especially republicans who are thinking of joining @entity20 , @entity19 and others			0
the key is to do this without stimulating some kind of backlash in their constituencies			0
the moment for an immigration deal has arrived			1
the political incentives for saying yes are strong in both parties , and this is an issue that needs a resolution			0
the key question will be whether @entity41 seizes this opportunity or whether partisanship paralyzes the institution once again , as it has done so many times before			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			1

@entity245 : it appears that the opportunity for bold immigration reform has finally arrived
@entity245 : a growing chorus of @entity9 is coming around to endorsing reform
he says with the right media attention and *compromises* in @entity205 , it could happen
@entity245 : immigration rights activists must also continue their grass - roots effort
