beneath the snow - capped peaks of @entity2 a group of hardy souls are ditching their skis , and jumping on a horse			1
below the pistes , it 's time for snow polo			1
winter in the @entity12 resort sees a group of dedicated players transform a frozen lake into a battlefield of hooves and mallets			2
" we could n't wait until summer came again , so we had to be creative , " explains @entity19 , who organizes the tournament			2
and if sending a bunch of horses onto a frozen lake sounds like a recipe for disaster , @entity22 points out : " horses on snow are not new			2
" @entity2 has been doing this for a while			1
its annual snow polo event began in 1985 and , since 1907 , a series of horse races dubbed the " @entity40 " have been staged each february , involving not just hockeys but " skijorers " who ride behind their horse , on skis			1
" the question is how to play sport on the lake , with the abrupt motion that polo has , " continues @entity19			1
" the technical possibilities have changed dramatically			2
thirty years ago we had a little @entity49 machine to try to make a field			2
now we have sophisticated machinery to make the surface			2
better surface , better polo -- that is the secret of polo			2
" we create the field by mixing the ice with layers of prepared snow , so it does n't get slippery			1
then , we invented a shoe for the horse so the snow does n't pile up in the hoof			1
" that is achieved thanks to a rubber pad between the shoe and the hoof , which dislodges snow			2
modern snow polo horseshoes also use a lip at the toe , coupled with cleats at the heel , to give horses the traction to compete safely			1
in another safety move , the game 's periods -- or chukkas -- are shorter			2
playing polo in the rarefied @entity2 air is more tiring for horses ( and humans ) than life at sea level			1
" @entity90 polo is very different , " says @entity86 , captain one of the teams at this year 's event , in late january and early february			1
" the game is a bit slower -- there is less control of the ball since you 're playing on snow , it 's very difficult to have control -- but it 's faster mentally			2
" the game can change from one second to another in a faster way compared to playing on grass			0
it 's slower , but somehow more difficult to play			0
" the high - visibility orange ball helps to slow the game , and also makes it trickier , being softer and larger than a standard polo ball			2
" some of the best players in the world get along with it -- some do n't , " says @entity19			0
" you have to have a different swing			0
if you hit it at full strength , it has a worse effect			0
like soccer , you have to have the feeling for the ball , it 's more sophisticated			0
" it 's funny to see some very good players who do n't get along with it			0
in 30 years , we 've found out who is good and who is not so good ... and we invite the good guys			0
" that is a matter of opinion			0
somewhat bizarrely , for a sport quite this exclusive , rival snow polo events face off each february -- both calling themselves the @entity136			1
@entity2 bills itself a @entity136 and proudly maintains it is the original , and best			1
but , over in @entity139 , @entity140 , organizers are preparing to host a @entity141 of their own			1
the @entity140 one is backed by the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) , the sport 's world governing body			1
" we feel it is really the ultimate world championship , " says dr @entity147 , who stood down as @entity143 president in late 2014			0
" all of the teams [ in @entity139 ] are national teams , they do actually represent their countries , the players all have to be citizens of that country			0
that 's a twist to most of the other tournaments , where teams are frequently mixed			0
" dr @entity147 is correct that in @entity2 , teams are usually a mix of nationalities backed by a major sponsor			1
for instance , @entity86 's team will feature the @entity169 alongside a @entity170 and two @entity172 pros			0
@entity86 , making his @entity2 debut after 10 years playing snow polo , is convinced he is heading to the toughest tournament in the world			1
" the most competitive event on snow , from what i 've heard and seen , is @entity2 , " he insists			1
and organizer @entity19 , naturally , wo n't hear of any competition for snow polo 's crown			1
" it 's a jungle out there , " he admits , with a laugh			0
" everybody does more or less what they want			0
but they call @entity190 of snow polo in the newspapers here			1
it 's the best tournament in the world			0
" optically , it 's unbelievable			0
you 're at 1,800 meters ( 5,905 feet ) on a frozen lake , playing polo in the snow with a blue sky			1
it 's a very unique thing			0
" and the food is fantastic			0
we have world - class chefs , the champagne is flowing , the vodka -- no caviar , the lake is frozen so we ca n't get the fish out , " he jokes			0
" if you bring caviar , you 'll make some friends			0
" you 'll be paying upwards of $ 500 to get at the chefs and champagne , who are there to serve the many @entity218 who descend on @entity2 each year			1
but , as @entity19 points out , admission to the lakeside grandstand is free			0
" you go there , you buy your sausage , you drink your beer , you watch snow polo , " he instructs			1
" you have the snow , the cold , the blue sky , the mountains -- the horses , you see the steam -- it 's high - class polo			2
it 's the best tournament in the world			0
