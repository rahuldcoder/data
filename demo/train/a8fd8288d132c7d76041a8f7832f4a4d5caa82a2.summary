@entity0 -- using the available scientific evidence " it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion " about the source of the anthrax used in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks which killed five people , according to a report issued tuesday by the @entity10			1
the findings come two and a half years after the @entity12 said @entity14 microbiologist @entity13 was allegedly behind the anthrax mailings , and the spores could be genetically traced to a flask labeled @entity18 - 1029 in his lab. the scientific panel said the anthrax used in mailings to news organizations and members of @entity25 was the @entity26 strain bacillus anthracis , and spores from those letters shared " a number of genetic similarities " with spores in @entity13 ' flask			1
but the findings say the @entity12 did not fully explore other possible explanations for those similarities			2
@entity13 knew he was under suspicion by the @entity12 and committed suicide in july 2008 before any charges were filed against him			1
@entity13 was involved in anthrax vaccine research at the @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			1
@entity43 , a lawyer who represented @entity13 , said that since august 2008 , the @entity44 has maintained it had a " smoking gun " in the case against @entity13 , citing the flask			1
" their smoking gun just turned into smoke and mirrors , " @entity43 said of the report			0
" they said they had a smoking gun that would have convicted him ( @entity13 ) in court and this report shows they did n't			2
" @entity43 later added : " over 200 people had access to the anthrax that came out of that flask			0
" in response to the report , the @entity12 said , while the scientific investigation could not pinpoint the source of the anthrax , it helped its agents and the @entity44 to focus resources and conclude that @entity13 was behind the attacks			1
" ultimately , the late dr. @entity13 was determined to be the perpetrator of the deadly mailings			2
the @entity12 and @entity44 were preparing for prosecution at the time of dr. @entity77 's death , " the @entity12 said			1
@entity13 maintained his innocence up until his death , @entity43 said , adding that tuesday 's report " just casts doubts " on the @entity12 's conclusion that his former client was responsible			1
the @entity12 praised the report for highlighting the value of what the @entity12 called " microbial forensics , " which it said " proved significant " in solving the case			2
" although there have been great strides in forensic science over the years , rarely does science alone solve an investigation			0
the scientific findings in this case provided investigators with valuable investigative leads that led to the identification of the late dr. @entity13 as the perpetrator of the anthrax attacks , " the @entity12 said			1
throughout the anthrax probe , investigators grappled with questions about how much experience the perpetrator would have needed to make the anthrax and whether the material was " weaponized " with a silicon dispersant to allow it to float through the air , thus making it more likely the deadly spores would be inhaled			0
the @entity10 panel said it found " no scientific basis on which to accurately estimate the amount of time or the specific skill set needed to prepare the spore material contained in the letters			0
" the panel said the time required to make the anthrax could range from two to three days to several months depending on the methods used to make the anthrax			2
the group said it found no evidence the perpetrator intentionally added silicon - based dispersants to increase the flow of spores in the air			0
the panel said silicon was not detected on the outside of the spores which would be necessary as a dispersant			0
@entity134 was found only inside the spores			0
the @entity12 conducted a security review of the academy 's draft report in october 2010			1
the @entity12 subsequently asked to provide the panel some additional information			2
that material included an analysis of environmental samples taken from " an undisclosed overseas site at which a terrorist group 's anthrax program was allegedly located			2
" investigators looked at the overseas site as part of the anthrax letters investigation			2
the @entity10 report said samples from the site had inconsistent evidence of @entity155 anthracis and further review was recommended			0
the @entity12 also told the panel an analysis was done on human remains identified as belonging to 9/11 hijackers from @entity161 which crashed in @entity162			2
one test came up positive for anthrax but all other results were negative			0
remains from the other 9/11 flights were not tested for anthrax			0
the @entity10 report offers no opinion on @entity13 ' guilt or innocence			1
it looks only at the scientific underpinnings of the @entity12 's investigation			1
the scientists also did not have access to classified information			0
the @entity12 asked the @entity10 to conduct an independent review of the science used in its investigation			1
that review began in 2009			0
the @entity12 's investigation of the anthrax attacks was closed in february 2010 and some critics have said the bureau should have delayed that move until the release of the @entity10 report			1
rep. @entity189 , a @entity190 from @entity191 who had criticized the @entity12 investigation , said he 's re-introducing legislation calling for a 9/11 style commission to look into the anthrax letter attacks			1
" it would take a credulous person to believe the circumstantial evidence that the @entity12 used to draw its conclusions with such certainty , " @entity189 said in a press release			2
" the @entity12 has not proiven to me that this is an open and shut case			0
" the anthrax letters were mailed from @entity191 , the state @entity189 represents			0
@entity206 sen. @entity205 , the ranking @entity207 on the @entity208 , said the report " shows that the science is not necessarily a slam dunk			0
" @entity205 called for an independent review of the @entity12 's investigation			1
at one time the @entity12 used @entity13 as one of its scientific consultants in the anthrax investigation			1
after clues led investigators to focus on @entity13 , the @entity12 performed surveillance on him , executed search warrants and studied lab records showing he had spent late hours alone in his lab prior to the time the anthrax letters were mailed			1
after his death , @entity44 and @entity12 officials released numerous documents from the investigation and said they believed @entity13 bore sole responsibility for the attacks			1
the anthrax - laced letters were mailed in fall 2001 -- shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks -- to then @entity234 news anchor @entity233 , the @entity235 , sens. @entity236 of @entity237 and @entity238 , who was the @entity239 at the time			0
five people died from inhalation anthrax which officials say was caused by contaminated mail			0
two of those people were @entity0 area postal workers @entity247 and @entity249 the other victims were @entity251 , a photo editor at @entity252 in @entity253 , @entity254 ; @entity255 , a @entity257 hospital worker ; and @entity255 , an @entity260 , @entity259 , widow			0
seventeen other people became sick from either inhaling anthrax or skin exposure .			0

new : legislators call for independent review of the @entity12 's investigation
@entity269 says it can not say what was the source of the anthrax used in the attacks
the panel does not offer an opinion on the guilt or innocence of suspect @entity13
@entity13 , who knew he was under suspicion by the @entity12 , committed suicide in 2008
