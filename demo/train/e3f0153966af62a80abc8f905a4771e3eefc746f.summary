republicans hoping to secure yet another @entity2 victory in their already substantial majority won in the 2014 midterm election are on edge as @entity0 candidate @entity7 's lead over incumbent rep. @entity8 has dwindled down to a mere 161 votes , a margin small enough to trigger an automatic recount			1
this will be the state 's first - ever congressional recount			0
emerging from election night , @entity7 led @entity8 by a mere 36 votes			2
but technical difficulties later triggered a recount for early votes in @entity20 -- a predominantly @entity0 area -- that gave @entity7 a slightly greater lead			1
weeks later , @entity8 tried to cut @entity24 's lead by challenging a decision by election officials to reject 133 votes from two predominantly liberal counties			0
but on thursday , a @entity30 federal judge denied the request			0
@entity32 files suit in uncalled @entity2 race the recount procedure in the @entity36 is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner -- determined by tuesday , december 16			1
