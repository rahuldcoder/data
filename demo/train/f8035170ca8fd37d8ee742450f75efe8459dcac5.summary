-- of all things , it was surfing that first led @entity4 to @entity5			1
@entity6 ( chapter ) 57 of the @entity8 is described by @entity4 as a triptych			1
the southern @entity11 artist rode the waves in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , and on dry land , his curiosity piqued about the religion practiced there			1
he visited mosques and eventually , acquired a translated copy of the quran , @entity5 's holy book			1
then came the chilling attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and @entity4 realized that @entity24 knew very little about the teachings of the @entity8			1
he embarked on a project to paint all 114 suras ( chapters ) -- but in a way that no one had done before			1
the 46 - year - old painter re-imagined @entity33 's 7th - century revelation to the @entity34 in contemporary @entity24 context			1
@entity4 began transcribing the chapters , relating each to the things he knew best			1
so far , he has completed 60 chapters			1
" @entity41 " is currently on display in two @entity11 galleries			0
" the simple goal was to take text and make it more familiar , " he said			0
so , the @entity8 's opening chapter , seven verses asking for @entity33 's guidance , often found displayed in @entity49 homes , is bordered with arabesqing shapes that on closer inspection reveal objects essential to @entity24 home life -- spatulas , forks , toothbrushes , glasses , ladders , egg beaters , flip - flops			1
to illustrate a verse that speaks metaphorically about the thundering hooves of camels , @entity4 painted a stock - car race			1
how would @entity24 , after all , relate to camels ? the red , white and blue hues of a political convention accompany verses on hypocrisy			1
other scenes unfold in offices , suburban lawns and sushi bars			0
they show funerals , weddings and holidays			0
and then there is sura 44 , called ad - dukhan ( smoke )			0
" therefore , watch for the day when the sky brings a profound smoke			0
it will envelope the people ; this is a painful retribution , " chapter 44 says			0
@entity4 pushes buttons with his interpretation : a diptych of a @entity91 street scene , smoke billowing from the @entity93			2
" i knew i would have to bring up the @entity93			2
otherwise this project would have been disingenuous , " @entity4 said			1
" it was the crux of understanding of @entity5 for @entity24			1
" and the impetus for @entity4 's undertaking			1
@entity100 gallery owner @entity99 knew the @entity102 panel had the greatest potential to offend			0
she said she worried about reaction to the piece , but said there was nothing malicious about @entity4 's intent			1
" it was a tough piece , " she said			0
" but he 's not intending to upset anyone			0
" @entity4 says he is not a deeply religious person			2
he has , however , established a reputation for tackling projects of epic proportions , including work that explored the @entity118 war and @entity120 's " @entity119			0
" @entity121 said some @entity123 blogs have accused the artist of being an apologist for @entity5			2
and @entity49 reaction to his latest work has been mixed			0
half of " @entity8 " is at @entity121 's gallery			1
the other 30 chapters are on display at the @entity133 gallery in @entity134			0
but four miles down @entity136 , the reviews are not good			0
@entity137 , a spokesman for the @entity138 , the largest in @entity139 , said he had no plans to see @entity4 's work			1
@entity137 could not even get past the title			0
" @entity24 quran is very misleading , " @entity137 said			2
" there is no such thing as an @entity8 just as there is no @entity148 quran or @entity149 or @entity150			2
there is only one @entity8			2
" i am disheartened , " he continued			0
" it gives a wrong impression			0
" @entity137 has heard about @entity4 's vivid imagery			1
he said he understood the artist had good intentions and he respected freedom of expression			0
but he could not accept the idea of an illustrated quran			0
that , he said , goes against the grain of of his religion			0
" in @entity5 , we do n't have pictures			2
and that is what we avoid , " @entity137 said			0
@entity4 , however , does not plan to abandon his personal @entity8 project			1
he hopes to complete all 114 chapters by 2011 , painstakingly transcribing by hand each chapter taken from a 1861 @entity176 translation of the quran and painting with gouache on 16 - by - 24 - inch paper			2
he said his panels are not literal illustrations but highly personal meditations on the messages in the @entity8			2
it was important to him that @entity24 recognized that @entity5 scripture was no more strange , poetic , violent or beautiful than any other religious text ; that it was telling similar stories that are in the @entity190			1
that 's a message people expect from scholars , peacemakers , even theologians but not necessarily from a @entity11 surfer dude .			0

surfing waves in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 *inspired* @entity4 's interest in @entity5
9/11 attacks led @entity4 to realize @entity24 knew very little about the @entity8
he embarked on a project to paint all 114 suras ( chapters )
so far , he has completed 60 chapters of " @entity8 "
