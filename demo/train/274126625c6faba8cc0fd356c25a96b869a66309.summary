the k - 12 @entity4 school remained closed on tuesday as investigators tried to figure out what " toxic irritant " had been released on the playground			1
they quickly figured out that it was n't fertilizer or pepper spray , @entity19 reports			0
six habanero chili peppers caused this hot mess			1
investigators found the spicy fruits scattered in the wood chips near the playground , school district communications director @entity36 told @entity0			1

@entity44 generally score between 100,000 and 350,000 units on the @entity47 scale , which measures chili pepper hotness			2
