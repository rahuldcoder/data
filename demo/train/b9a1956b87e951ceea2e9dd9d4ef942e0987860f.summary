-- @entity2 's main protagonists are saving their best until last thanks to a controversial new rule change at sunday 's season - ending @entity6			1
the 2014 drivers ' championship will be decided at the desert denouement when @entity12 title rivals @entity10 and @entity13 roll out for a double or nothing gamble			1
@entity10 leads @entity13 in the standings by a healthy 17 - point margin , but a new rule awarding double points at the season finale has raised the stakes			1
the top - 10 finishers at the twilight race will get two points for the price of one with the race winner earning 50 points			2
the rule change means it is mathematically much easier for @entity13 -- son of 1982 world champion @entity29 -- to snatch the title from championship leader @entity10			1
should @entity13 win the @entity6 , @entity10 , who won the world championship with @entity33 in 2008 , must finish second to stop his @entity35 teammate winning his first world title			1
if the race win was worth 25 points -- as it has been at the preceding 18 races this season -- @entity10 could finish as low as sixth and still claim a second world championship			1
the double points rule was the brainchild of the @entity2 's commercial supremo @entity45 and was introduced by the sport 's governing body the @entity46			1
the new ruling dangled the carrot of keeping the championship alive until the very last race , and so it has proved			2
but the novelty of double points has had a lukewarm reception , even from the man who has the most to gain from the rule change			1
" i find it artificial and i do n't like it in general , " @entity13 told the media after his victory at the last race in @entity60			1
" of course , now with the way it is , it 's great for me			0
we 'll see how it goes this year			0
we need to keep on reviewing it			0
" describing the double points as " artificial " puts @entity13 in tune with the general feeling among @entity2 's inner circle of drivers , teams and the traveling media pack			1
the concept of a single race being arbitrarily twice as valuable as the other 18 on the calendar has been hard to digest among the sport 's diehard racers			0
but hard - racing @entity10 -- who describes his attacking style behind the wheel as " driving like i stole it " -- is adopting a cool and calm approach to the high stakes race in @entity85			1
" it 's something you ca n't be thinking about , " said @entity10 , who has won 10 races in 2014 compared to @entity13 's five victories so far			1
" it 's not something i 'm willing to accept			0
i 'm just going to keep pushing as hard as i can and to win as many points as i can			0
" i ca n't be thinking , ' what happens , if this happens in the future ? ' if we lived our life like that maybe you wo n't achieve what you set out to achieve			0
" the @entity12 hybrid turbo car has been the dominant force this season and the team sealed its first - ever team title with three races still to go			0
an 11th one - two finish in @entity60 saw the @entity108 also break the previous record for the most one - two finishes in a single season set by fierce @entity33 rivals @entity113 and @entity114 in 1988			0
but the drivers ' championship , which has swung between @entity117 and @entity13 throughout the season , is still poised precariously ahead of the @entity85 finale			2
" both are worthy champions , " @entity12 motorsport director @entity120 said of his dueling drivers on the team 's official website			0
" of course , there will be bitter disappointment for one of them and great joy for the other			0
it is now down to us to ensure that this fascinating year concludes in the right way by giving @entity10 and @entity13 a platform to settle the title purely on the track			2
may the best man win ! " there are whispers the @entity12 bosses are privately worried a reliability problem could decide which of their men wins the title			2
@entity120 told the @entity143 if @entity10 broke down during the race it would be " a nightmare			2
" @entity10 retired with an engine problem in @entity148 , a brake failure in @entity150 and because of damage to his car after @entity13 collided with his teammate in @entity154			1
in turn , @entity13 failed to finish the @entity156 @entity6 with a gearbox failure and electronics problems stopped him early in @entity159			2
a reliability issue for @entity10 could also be a major public relations headache for @entity12 , especially in the competitive arena of @entity2 where the finger of suspicion is always ready to point			2
it could also have ramifications on the driver market			0
@entity10 's @entity12 contract runs out at the end of 2015 and he is due to discuss new terms after the season while @entity13 signed an improved multi-year contract in the summer			1
@entity172 and @entity33 are yet to confirm their 2015 driver lineups while on wednesday @entity174 became the latest driver to secure his seat for next season with @entity178			0
for now , the @entity12 duelists go into the @entity6 weekend knowing the title is in their hands			2
@entity10 won the twilight race for @entity33 in 2011 and has taken pole at the glittering @entity184 twice but was beaten in qualifying and the race by his @entity188 last season			0
" i go into this race with no fear and with every belief that this can be my title , " said @entity13			0
" win or lose , double points or no double points , i feel proud of what i have achieved this year			1
" on the opposite side of the @entity12 garage , @entity10 is also counting on fortune 's favor in @entity85			1
" i 'm hoping that bad luck wo n't play a part this time around and i know the team has been working flat out to make sure it does n't , " he said			0
" i 'm feeling relaxed , i 'm feeling confident and i 'm ready to win			0
" @entity2 's twilight finale in @entity85 is poised to be a sensational showstopper but when the sun goes down on the 2014 season only one man be will riding into the sunset as the new world champion			1
