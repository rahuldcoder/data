@entity3 's beating after a high - speed car chase and its aftermath forever changed @entity5 , its police department and the dialogue on race in @entity50			1
" i am saddened by the death of @entity3 , " said @entity51 , a @entity5 city councilman who served as @entity53 chief from 1997 to 2002			1
" although his beating will forever be thought of as one of the ugliest moments in the history of the city of @entity5 and its police department , the victimization of mr. @entity3 and the circumstances that followed created an atmosphere that allowed @entity53 and the city to make historic disciplinary and community - based reforms that have made for a better police department and a better city as a whole			1
" " @entity3 was a symbol of civil rights and he represented the anti-police brutality and anti-racial profiling movement of our time , " the rev. @entity69 said in a statement			1
" it was his beating that made @entity50 focus on the presence of profiling and police misconduct			2
" @entity3 was 25 and on parole after a robbery conviction in march 1991			1
in an interview in 2011 , he recalled he had been drinking and was headed home from a friend 's house when he saw a police car following him and panicked , thinking he would be sent back to prison			0
so he attempted to flee			0
" i had a job to go to that monday , and i knew i was on parole , and i knew i was n't supposed to be drinking , and i 'm like ' oh , my @entity93 , ' " he told @entity89			0
related : @entity3 looks back without anger he realized he could n't outrun the police , but looked for a public place to stop			1
" i saw all those apartments over there , so i said , ' i 'm gon na stop right there , ' " he said			0

four @entity53 officers -- @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and sgt. @entity137 -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer			2
but following a three - month trial in the predominantly white @entity5 suburb of @entity146 , three of the officers were acquitted of all charges			1
the jury , which had no black members , deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against @entity135 , and a mistrial was declared on that charge			0

" most of the nation only saw a few snippets where it 's the most violent , " @entity155 said			0

rioters ran through the streets -- looting businesses , torching buildings and attacking those who were in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
the violence was responsible for more than 50 deaths and $ 1 billion in property damage			0
on the third day of rioting , @entity3 emerged from seclusion to make a plea : " people , i just want to say , can we all get along ? can we get along ? " the violence ceased , but the debate did not			1
nearly a year later , the four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges			2
two african - americans were picked for the jury , and @entity3 testified			1
he hedged , however , on whether police used racial slurs during the beating			2
he told @entity89 in 2011 that slurs were used , but said he vacillated on the stand because his mother had told him to avoid talking about race			0
@entity137 and @entity135 were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison			2
@entity134 and @entity195 were acquitted			2
" it was like ... i just hope we just get one , " @entity3 said			1

" ... they just did n't care			0
like , ' he broke the law			2
he deserved what he got			0
' i told them they were crazy			0
it was about justice for what happened to him			0
no one deserves to get beat like that			2

on the 20th anniversary of the beating in 2011 , he was pulled over and ticketed for a minor traffic violation			2
" the trouble that ( people ) see me in is a part of my life that i 'm working on , " he said in 2011			0
" i 'll always have an issue when it comes to alcohol			0
my dad was an alcoholic			0
the addiction part is in my blood			0
what i 've learned to do is arrest my addiction -- arrest it myself , so i do n't get arrested			0

" the ranks of @entity5 police are much more diverse than they were at the time of @entity3 's beating			1
changes have also been made -- some compelled by the courts -- in the way certain neighborhoods are patrolled and how complaints are handled			0
@entity69 said in his statement sunday that he had recently spent time with @entity279 discussing the release of his book			0
" through all that he had gone through with his beating and personal demons , he was never one to not call for reconciliation and for his people to overcome and forgive , " @entity69 said			2
@entity3 said last year on the 20th anniversary of his beating that he has forgiven the officers who beat him			1
" yes , i 've forgiven them , because i 've been forgiven many times , " he said			2
" my country 's been good to me ... this country is my house , it 's the only home i know , so i have to be able to forgive -- for the future , for the younger generation coming behind me , so ... they can understand it and if a situation like that happened again , they could deal with it a lot easier			0
