-- " they must know what they 're doing , right ? " it 's a common enough phrase , often muttered by nervous people who are thinking the exact opposite -- who are expressing doubts about those who seem to be in charge , the ones who are supposed to have all the answers			1
the bus to work is making a strange , loud , thumping sound , but the driver keeps motoring along			1
there 's an unmistakable smell of smoke coming from the restaurant kitchen , but the waiters and waitresses continue taking orders as if nothing is amiss			1
there is lightning in the sky above the outdoor field of a sporting event and warning sirens can be heard from somewhere in town , but the officials allow the contest to play on			1
the packaged meat looks a little funny , but the sell - by date is current , and the supermarket has it out on prominent display			2
" they must know what they 're doing , right ? " we tend to take it on faith that they -- whoever the amorphous " they " may be -- are on the case and full of expertise and wisdom , ever on the lookout for any threats to the well - being of those who are counting on them			2
so when there are signs that mistakes have slipped past inspectors , past engineers , past control towers -- signs that , for all the double - checking , perhaps a little triple - or quadruple - checking may have been called for -- people pause to consider if the safeguards assumed to be constantly in place are really so fail - safe			2
this @entity66 weekend , @entity65 are pondering a series of recent events that have called into question the airtightness of the business world 's layers of quality assurance , and the effectiveness of the in - house inspection processes that are supposed to monitor and affirm that assurance before customers can be adversely affected			1
food - product recalls around the nation have brought worries to consumers used to taking home products assuming they are safe			1
in @entity84 and @entity85 , state health departments directed people not to eat raw clover sprouts produced by @entity88 after the @entity89 cited seven confirmed and three likely cases of e. coli infection			2
nearly 15,000 pounds of hummus and dip products were voluntarily recalled by @entity94 because of possible bacterial contamination flagged by the @entity97 @entity96			2
merchants in @entity99 and @entity100 were returning bulk and packaged walnuts to @entity103 , which issued a recall as a precautionary measure against possible listeria			2
and the @entity108 's @entity107 announced that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because of possible e. coli contamination			0
in the world of automobiles , @entity111 signaled to @entity115 analysts that it may continue with recalls into the middle of the summer			1
@entity111 , so far this year , has called in almost 14 million vehicles in the @entity65 , in 29 separate recalls -- which constitutes more vehicles recalled than the total of what @entity111 has sold domestically in the last five years			1
the @entity123 was looking into a near miss between two passenger jets in the skies near @entity127 in @entity128 earlier this month			0
this follows the @entity123 's investigation of two other recent near - miss incidents , one at @entity133 in @entity134 and the other at @entity136 in @entity137 , where a passenger jet reportedly almost collided with a drone			1
most of the time , things go just fine			0
but when stories like these appear in the news in a single week , there is the impulse to wonder just what else is perhaps being missed			0
and to reflect upon just how many times each day we depend on precision and diligence that , without knowing exactly who is responsible for it , we presume is there			0
in truth , people reluctantly understand that the idea of endless layers of perfectionist platoons of unblinking and errorless industrial inspectors , while something to be aimed for , is probably a pipe dream			0
consumers know that their own common sense , and personal scrutiny of what they buy , is their best protection			1
yet there are many areas in which the customer can not be expected to be an expert , which is why the relentlessness and rigor of professional inspectors and regulators is so essential			0
the old joke is that the ultimate act of faith in one 's fellow man is opening the door to take a box of pizza from the delivery guy , and then eating it			0
but each time you step into a high - rise elevator and count on all the mechanisms that hold it in the air being up to standards ; each time you get a prescription filled and count on the pharmacist dispensing the correct medication into the bottle ; each time you watch your child climb onto a purposely scary amusement park ride and count on someone having made certain every rail at every turn is intact and tight and correctly angled ; each time you blithely drive through a green - light signal at a busy intersection and count on the light for the perpendicular street being red just like it 's supposed to be ; each time you start to count backward from 100 as the anesthesiologist begins to administer the first drops of the dose before you drift off			1
... each time , you are , of necessity , relying on the conscientiousness , thoroughness , and devotion to detail of strangers			0
there 's a whole lot that , without stopping too often to ruminate over it , we assure ourselves is being done correctly by people we will never meet			0
thinking too much about that , especially after a week like the one just past , could drive us nuts			0
and after all , they must know that they 're doing			0

@entity225 : we count on notion that some vague official authority is protecting our safety
he says recent food recalls , @entity111 recalls and planes ' near misses *remind* us this is *n't* always so
he says giving others sway over our safety carries risk . use common sense where possible
