-- part of @entity3 's job had been to manage a laboratory that conducted clinical trials using various drugs and chemicals			1
until he was accused of using one of those substances -- cyanide -- to kill his wife			2
on friday , a @entity14 jury determined that this accusation was well founded , convicting the @entity16 medical researcher and professor of murder in death of 41 - year - old @entity21			1
as juror @entity22 told reporters afterward , " it was very hard for me to accept and to believe that he could have done it			2
" but i felt that the facts were clear , and i could n't argue with them			1
" for many on the outside , there seemed little amiss in the lives of @entity3 and @entity21			1
they both had successful careers , including @entity21 as a top neurologist at the @entity37			2
their house was brightened by @entity21 's then - 6 - year - old daughter , @entity40			1
and they 'd just returned from a trip to @entity43			0
" i 've never seen anything to suggest they were anything but a happy couple with a beautiful little girl , " their neighbor @entity44 said			0
then , on april 17 , 2013 , @entity3 called 911 and said his wife was " conscious and breathing , but not alert " inside their @entity53 home			2
" please , please , please , " he said			0
" ... i think my wife is having a stroke			0
" when paramedics arrived , they found @entity21 on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine			2
she died three days later			0
according to a criminal complaint , several text messages sent between the couple suggest @entity3 urged @entity21 to try using creatine to get help her get pregnant			1
whatever @entity3 's rationale , there 's no scientific consensus that creatine supplements -- which some use to build muscle mass and may have medical value -- help with female fertility ; in fact , the @entity76 says pregnant women should not use creatine			1
regardless , authorities say it was n't the creatine that killed @entity21 -- but rather cyanide that had been mixed with it			1
one day before @entity21 fell ill , @entity3 had used a credit card to place an overnight order for more than a half - pound of cyanide			1
at the time the order was placed , there were no active projects at @entity3 's lab that involved the use of cyanide , according to the complaint			1
and when investigators looked at the bottle , they found that over 8 grams of cyanide were missing from it			0
cyanide is often used in research laboratories for experiments			0
in humans , in which it interferes with a body 's ability to use oxygen to produce energy , it can be deadly			0
in july 2013 , @entity3 was charged in his late wife 's death , arrested in @entity109 , then extradited back to @entity14			1
accused professor waives extradition and why did @entity21 die ? more than a week after her collapse , after being told that she 'd been fatally poisoned with cyanide , @entity3 himself asked detectives , " why would she do that to herself ? " a few seconds later , according to the complaint , he added : " who would do this to her ? " another neighbor of the couple , who asked not to be identified , said it was no secret that @entity21 wanted another baby			1
but she told the neighbor 's wife @entity3 did not share that desire			1
the criminal complaint raises another source of friction : @entity3 confronted his wife three times within weeks of her death about whether or not she was having an affair			1
" further , evidence has been uncovered that reflects that the victim intended to have a conversation with @entity3 and @entity143 would ' not like the discussion , ' " the complaint adds			2
the case lingered for months , before finally going to trial in october			0
dozens of witnesses took the stand , perhaps none more key than @entity3 himself			2
his lawyer , @entity152 , said after the verdict that he thought his client " did extremely well " on the stand			0
" i thought he was very candid ... and he was telling the truth			0
" yet , rather than be convinced of his innocence , jurors said that inconsistencies in his testimony played a significant role in their guilty verdict			0
" i think he has excellent coaches , " @entity162 said			0
" i think he had a year to think about the story he wanted to tell			0
" @entity152 said that it 's going to take time to review the " 80 - plus search warrants , multitudes of evidence ( and ) terabytes of information " before deciding on the defense team 's next steps , including a possible appeal			0
@entity21 's parents , meanwhile , returned home to care for young @entity40 and cherish the memories of the girl 's late mother			2
" while we are pleased that the person responsible for @entity21 's death has been brought to justice , " the parents said in a statement , " nothing will ever fill the emptiness that we feel in our family and in our hearts			1
" @entity0 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0
