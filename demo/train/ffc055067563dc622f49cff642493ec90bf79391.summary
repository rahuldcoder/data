for close encounters of the furry , feathered , or scaly kind , there 's no place on the planet quite like the @entity6			1
" you just see some of the craziest things , " said @entity7 , operations manager for @entity8 , a @entity9 company that arranges trips to the region			2
" while you 're out snorkeling , the sea lions will come out and swim with you			0
... you feel a little nibble on the end of your flipper , you turn around and there 's this sea lion wanting to play with you , wanting you to chase it			1
" other times , they 'll come up to your face and they 're looking at their own reflection in your snorkel mask			0
" the @entity6 -- 19 islands that lie 600 miles west of @entity28 in the @entity29 -- are home to species of animals found nowhere else on @entity33			1
famously visited by @entity35 in 1835 , the archipelago played a key role in his theory of evolution			1
these days , both tourists and researchers flock to the islands to see giant tortoises that can live 150 years , marine iguanas that dive to find dinner , flightless cormorants , and penguins that somehow thrive near the equator			2
with few predators to make them wary of humans , many of the creatures seem tame and curious			1
" it 's just a fantastically wonderful place , " said @entity51 , a biology professor at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 , who has been to the @entity6 twice			1
" one of the most exciting things about it is that just the animals there are so fearless			2
so you have to step over sea lions and marine iguanas just to get from one place to another			0
" with their remote location , the @entity6 used to be more of a legend than a destination for most people -- but that 's no longer the case			1
in the 1960s , just 2,000 tourists a year visited the islands , according to the @entity76			2
today , that number has grown to more than 150,000			0
to limit their impact on the fragile ecosystem , @entity81 -- which makes up 97 % of the archipelago -- requires tourists to be accompanied by a certified guide when they enter protected areas			2
there are also limits on how many people can be at any visitor site at one time			0
" they seem to be doing a reasonable job of trying to find the happy medium between access and protection , " @entity51 said			0
here are some tips to consider if you want to pursue your own @entity6 adventure			1
what 's the best time to go ? you can have a great experience in the @entity6 year - round , @entity7 said , so there 's really is n't a " best time " to go			1
the busiest tourist seasons are during the summer and around @entity105 , when kids are out of school and people have extra vacation , he said			0
the warmest months are between january and may , when average temperatures reach the upper 70s and the low 80s			0
the driest months are from june to december			0
how do you get there ? the first step is to fly into mainland @entity28 and land either in @entity118 or @entity119			0
a nonstop flight from @entity121 to @entity118 takes about four hours			0
from there , travelers can fly to one of two airports in the @entity6 -- @entity126 or @entity127 -- via @entity128 , @entity129 or @entity130			1
that leg of the journey lasts about three hours from @entity118			0
@entity51 said he did n't find the trip particularly difficult			0
where do you stay ? you can choose land - based lodgings or a cabin at sea			1
there are four islands in the @entity6 with accommodations for tourists -- options that include everything from small lodges to luxury hotels , @entity7 said			1
@entity51 's hotels ranged from rustic to modern , but they were all comfortable and clean , he recalled			2
he dined at local restaurants , where seafood and chicken dishes were the most common fare			0
for those who prefer staying on land , @entity7 recommended the @entity154 in @entity155 on @entity156 and the @entity157 in @entity158 on @entity159			0
many visitors , however , choose to take a cruise around the @entity6 , so they stay on board ships and take lots of land excursions			1
the cruises carry anywhere from 16 to 100 passengers , and most of the ships are relatively small , so this is not a good option if you get seasick easily or are not keen on living on a boat for several days , @entity7 said			2
beginning next year , new regulations from @entity81 will ban cruises from visiting any site more than once in a 15 - day period			0
the goal is to cut tourist traffic at some of the most popular spots , according to the @entity181			0
you can book a 15 - day cruise or , if that is too long , sign up for a shorter itinerary			2
the most popular option is the 8 day / 7 night cruise , which " gives a good overview of the islands , " @entity7 said			1
what are some of the most popular activities on the @entity6 ? watching all of the incredible creatures , of course			1
( you might even catch a glimpse of the courtship dance of the blue - footed booby			0
) but there 's also snorkeling , sea kayaking , hiking , horseback riding , mountain biking and more			2
" the @entity6 is a great , great destination for scuba diving , " @entity7 said			1
" but it is for intermediate to expert ( divers )			0
it 's not a place for beginning scuba diving because you have pretty strong underwater currents and the water is quite cold			2
" how much does a @entity6 trip cost ? as always , it all depends on your accommodations and length of stay , but here 's an estimate of expenses : coach airfare from the @entity224 to mainland @entity28 varies widely depending on your departure point			1
once in @entity28 , a round - trip flight to the @entity6 costs about $ 400			1
there is a $ 100 fee to enter @entity81			0
an eight - day cruise around the islands will set you back anywhere from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000 per person , which includes accommodations , meals and excursions with a naturalist guide , @entity7 said .			1

the @entity6 are home to species of animals found nowhere else on @entity33
with few predators to make them wary , the creatures seem tame and curious
@entity6 tourism has been booming despite the archipelago 's remote location
lodgings are available on four of the islands ; many visitors also stay on cruise ships
