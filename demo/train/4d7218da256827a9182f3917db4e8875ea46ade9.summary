editor 's note : we asked readers to weigh in on @entity6 producer @entity5 's vacation destination , and you chose @entity8			1

giraffes are a common sight in @entity14			2
@entity14 , @entity8 ( @entity6 ) -- i spent two nights sleeping under a full - moon sky , nestled in my trusty hammock at @entity14			1
our guides provided us with tents , but i figured i would n't have too many opportunities in my life to slumber in the open bush on the @entity8 continent			1
thus , i rested more or less exposed throughout the night , hoping that a lion would n't figure that he would n't have too many opportunities in his life to maul a sleeping @entity31 tourist in the open bush on the @entity8 continent			1
needless to say , i survived , and it was magnificent			2
visually speaking , i was n't sure what , exactly , to expect from a @entity8 safari , for my complete mental database of safari images spanned a wide variety of distinct landscapes , and most were cartoonishly obstructed by rich , middle - aged tourists covered head to toe in unnecessary beige safari gear			1
however , @entity14 seemed to fit , quite perfectly , my idea of the @entity8 savannah			1
arid and brown from the winter dry season , it was a forever - long expanse of low trees and dusty earth , the kind that somehow allows the early sun to reflect that perfect glow of stunning reds and oranges			2
our guide was a self - proclaimed @entity8 bushman named @entity59 , who seemed to have an amazing one - ness with both the land and the animals			1
we 'd be driving down one of the many nondescript dirt roads at a fairly fast pace , only to have him hit the brakes of our jeep , slam into reverse and point out a leopard 200 yards away			2
it would take the rest of us a fair bit of time to finally see what he noticed at a mere passing glance			2
he knew the land , and he knew the animals -- a talent that proved helpful for finding the less common residents in the savannah			2
the other creatures carelessly came into view as though the roads and cars were just a natural part of their habitat , a mild annoyance at worst			0
ireport.com : share your @entity8 experiences and suggestions @entity14 is roughly the same size as @entity96 , and here , many animals roamed right along the roadside , gnawing on whatever vegetation remained until the rainy season would flourish the plants anew			1
seemingly endless miles of terrain , and there they were just feet away from us			0
if you did n't know you were in a national park , you might think you were in a zoo			0
that 's how close the animals came to our jeep			1
only , here , they were n't in separate enclosures , wandering aimlessly within an artificial terrain			0
this was truly their home , and we were only passing guests			0
giraffes tore away at high branches			0
elephants walked fearlessly , one - by - one across the road			0
@entity124 ... well , the rhinos pretty much just sat there looking stupid			0
the hippos splashed in the water			0
and the baboons stopped at nothing to make me laugh			0
of course , the rare lions and leopards pretty much just shaded themselves under distant trees , and the crocs swam silently through the bog			0
and just as soon as it began , our time in the @entity8 bush was over			1
a couple of giraffes and elephants met us by the roadside to bid our group farewell as we drove out of the park			0
the preserve faded silently behind us , and the road ahead paved my way to @entity153 for a short stopover before continuing to the second part of this @entity8 journey .			1
