@entity0 -- true love may be priceless , but does that mean we should pay through the nose for fine chocolate on @entity7 - or any day ? the answer is unequivocally yes in the opinion of @entity10 and @entity11 whose organic hand - crafted chocolate bars garnering rave reviews retail for $ 9			1
" you get what you pay for , " insisted @entity14 , 34			1
" for me , chocolate should n't be something you can pick up at the gas station for a buck or two			1
" the @entity21 are not gourmet chocolatiers -- the artisans who melt down large blocks of chocolate and refashion the mix into delectable treats of all shapes and flavors			1
rather , @entity10 and his brother @entity11 , 31 , are true chocolate makers in the tradition of @entity33 's oompa - loompas , though the towering , red - bearded masts -- @entity10 is 6 ' 4 " , @entity38 " -- could hardly be confused with author @entity37 's fictional lilliputian chocolate workers			1
from a small store - front factory in the @entity41 , @entity0 neighborhood of @entity42 , the masts are producing an intensely complex tasting chocolate -- yes , just the way fine wine should deliver layers of flavor -- even though their ingredients are as simple as can be : cacao beans and sugar			1
" we do n't dumb it down so it 's not as exotic or as sexy an experience , " said @entity14 explaining why he adds no milk fat , cocoa butter or emulsifiers			1
" chocolate should take you on a trip			2
" the masts began producing chocolate in their apartments			0
three years ago after maxing out several credit cards and investing their modest savings they turned their passion into a business that tries to live by an environmentally - friendly ethos			0
they purchase organic cacao beans from @entity72 , @entity73 and the @entity74			1
to reduce their carbon footprint this year they plan to have a friend who owns a large sailboat deliver some of their beans			0
the beans are roasted in two convection ovens for about 15 - to - 20 - minutes			0
then the chocolate - makers pour the beans into a custom - made whirling , buzzing contraption that separates the husk from the nibs -- the meat of the bean that becomes chocolate			1
the resulting nibs go into vats where granite wheels crush them			0
@entity95 is added and the mix is stirred until smooth			0
pans filled with the thick pudding - like concoction then sit on a shelf for a month , to allow the full flavor of the bean to emerge			0
finally , the cacao - sugar mix is melted down , stirred again and poured into bars			2
what results is a dark chocolate that tastes like so much more than chocolate : imagine chocolate infused with spice , citrus , and tea , except none of those is an ingredient			2
" we 're bringing out the different characteristics and the flavors people did n't think were imaginable from chocolate , " said @entity11			1
for extra variety the masts add coffee , hazelnuts , almonds , sea salt , peppers and black truffles to create additional flavors			0
a few of @entity0 's finer restaurants , including @entity130 , now offer @entity131 on their desert menus and leading gourmet shops carry the brand as well			0
the masts are shipping 5,000 chocolate bars a week and say they have 1,000 potential accounts on their waiting list			2
with a high content of cacao -- 70 % to 81 % -- @entity131 has as much of the chemicals behind chocolate 's mythical aphrodisiac qualities , the serotonin building - block tryptophan and stimulant phenylethylamine , as most any other bar			2
but , is it worth $ 9 for 2.5 ounces ? i ca n't say it 's the most delicious chocolate you will ever eat ; it has none of the sweetness that lures so many of us to chocolate			2
but it likely will be the most interesting chocolate you may ever taste			0
and , after all to keep priceless love aflame we need to keep things interesting .			0

chocolate should n't be something you can pick up at the gas station for a buck or two , says @entity14
ingredient list is simple : cacao beans and sugar
" we 're bringing out the different characteristics and the flavors people did n't think were imaginable from chocolate , " said @entity11 .
