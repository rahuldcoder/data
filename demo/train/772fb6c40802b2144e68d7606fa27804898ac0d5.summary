-- groups of graduate students who hang out at @entity3 , an indie band bar near the @entity5 campus , like their liquor and their politics straight up			0
many of them felt they only got one of those things after watching the debate between president @entity13 and @entity15 nominee @entity14 on wednesday night			1
" i do n't know what universe @entity14 is living in , " said @entity16 , a doctoral student in american latino literature			1

@entity0 poll : @entity14 wins debate by big margin " i am disappointed in @entity13			1
i felt like he was holding back			2
he 's too nice , " she said			2
" i understand that he has to come across nice but come on			0
after you hear @entity36 talk at the convention , he was willing to say it straight and not pull punches and it 's unfortunate that ( @entity13 ) does n't feel comfortable doing that			1
" @entity13 and @entity14 sparred over differences on the economy			1
in their points and counterpoints , both men drew regularly on examples of people who they met on the campaign trail who 've been hit hard by the economic downturn			0
some of those people were from towns like @entity53 , a community at the crossroads of the nation 's foreclosure and unemployment crises			1
connecting with the viewer : ' @entity14 was able to out @entity13 ' the city has the nation 's second highest foreclosure rate and an unemployment rate that at 17.5 % is twice the national average			1
it is also a city that is nearly 50 % @entity66 , a voting block both candidates are trying to woo			1
" we 're on just about every list it seems like , " said @entity69 , a @entity15 and @entity53 city councilman who helped lead a community discussion on the @entity5 campus after the debate			1
" people 's priorities here ( are ) jobs , jobs , jobs			2
" for generations , many people in @entity53 have depended on the land , growing things like almonds , strawberries and grapes			1

in an area that some residents call @entity98 's " fruit basket , " the housing crisis has further compounded the area 's woes			1
@entity13 , @entity14 clash over economy , health care at that debate watching party , people gathered at the university library 's " @entity107 " were glued to the television as the two candidates faced off			1
when the debate ended , the room full of students wanted to talk about education funding and student loans -- a topic the candidates spent little time discussing -- and jobs , @entity69 said			1
people in @entity53 want " to see what either administration is going to do with unemployment and foreclosures , " said @entity124 , a @entity125 and @entity53 city councilman who also helped lead the post debate discussion			1
speculators flooded the area at the height of the housing market in a frenzy to build and sell homes			0
just a few short years later , many of those homes were often left half finished when builders ran out of money or empty when their owners faced foreclosure after losing jobs and being unable to make mortgage payments			2
" @entity53 is ground zero for all of those concerns , " said @entity143 , a @entity53 native who is pursuing her doctorate in political science at the local @entity5 campus			2

i want the bread and butter			0

i was unimpressed to be honest			0
i know the expectations were n't that high for the president but i wanted him to be more aggressive , " @entity157 said adding that classmates talked about the topic at @entity3			0
most evenings , @entity157 spends her time poring over her studies in the hopes of one day getting a doctorate and a highly coveted tenure track teaching position			0
in the process she 's taken out thousands of dollars worth of student loans , so she listened with keen interest to the any mentions by the candidates ' of addressing student loan rates and soaring tuition costs			1

i 'm trying to start a career and a life , " she said			0
