" and for heaven 's sake , stop licking sledgehammers , @entity5			1

" " nothing but harm will come in the long run , from allowing yourself to be exploited , and it is absolutely not in any way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women , for you to send across the message that you are to be valued ( even by you ) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent , " the 46 - year - old singer says in the letter posted on her official website			0
