-- @entity1 returned to form this year , with @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity4 all choosing to launch flagship devices in @entity6			1
these are my picks from the show : @entity10 just months after being sold to @entity11 , @entity10 chose to launch its first @entity13 phones			1
the devices , all dubbed @entity10 , will run @entity13 but be packed with @entity11 services like @entity16 and @entity17			1
the company says the budget phone will enable @entity11 to enter emerging markets it currently ca n't reach , but whether they still feel that way when @entity11 takes control in march remains to be seen			0
@entity24 @entity2 launched a much more sensible , more cohesive smartphone than previous @entity27 devices			1
there 's a finger print scanner , a heart rate monitor , new camera tricks , and a clever way of making your downloads faster by combining @entity35 and signal coverage together			0
@entity2 also announced a fitness band with a curved oled screen as it continues its push into wearables			1
expect to want the gold one come april			0
@entity42 the @entity43 was very well received			1
however , the @entity42 sports the latest @entity45 processor , bringing with it a stack of improvements			2
that 's the main takeaway here for @entity3			1
@entity50 , better , faster , stronger , as @entity51 would say			0
early reports and a my own " hands - on " test suggest this is going to be one of the best @entity13 phones released this year			1
@entity4 @entity58 there are two ways to talk up your shiny new powerful tablet			2
the first is to let it quietly sell on the merits of what you include ; the second is to do that and then make sure everyone that comes to your press conference knows how good it is by you trashing the nearest competition - in this case the @entity76 and the ipad mini			0
an amazingly crisp screen , slim form factor , @entity81 capabilities and a price that is aggressive all help			0
a bluetooth battery @entity1 is not all about state - of - the - art handsets			2
one gadget that caught my eye is the @entity89			0
it appears to be an aa battery , but it 's actually a case for a aaa battery			0
the case is also @entity93 enabled , so after placing it in your child 's noisy toy , you can shut it off with your phone when playtime gets too much to bear			0
follow @entity101 on @entity102 : @ stuartmiles the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity101			2
