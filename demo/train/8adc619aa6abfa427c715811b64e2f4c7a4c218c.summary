-- @entity1 lives a double life			1
a normal teenager preparing for college , she is also a four - time olympic gold medalist who is rewriting swimming 's record books			1
when she 's not dealing with the usual trials and tribulations of homework and school life , she 's stepping out on the red carpet alongside @entity13 a-listers			1
" i describe my life as like @entity18 , " the @entity16 - born , @entity15 - based star told @entity0			1
" during the week i 'm totally @entity1 , going to school every day and going to practice and just totally being me			1
" but then at the weekend i 'm flying out to the @entity20 , going to these different events			2
it feels like i live a double life sometimes			1
" but the way i describe it also is that it 's not like my whole life has changed , just a part of it has changed			1
" while @entity33 has not yet reached the profile of @entity18 , the schoolgirl / popstar played in the kids ' tv series and movies by @entity38 , she is on her way			2
on sunday , aged 18 , @entity33 helped the @entity42 women 's relay team to victory in the 4 x 100 meter medley at the world championships in @entity46 , giving her a record sixth gold medal of the meeting -- an unprecedented total for a female swimmer			1
only her legendary compatriot @entity51 has won more gold medals at one championships			1
the " @entity57 " took seven golds at the 2007 event in @entity56			1
when @entity59 hung up his goggles at the end of @entity62 , he charged @entity33 with matching his legacy and equaling his record haul of 22 @entity66 medals			1
no pressure then , @entity1			1
" on the last night we were in @entity70 , he ( @entity59 ) had finished swimming , he was done , " recalls @entity33			1
" he looked at me and said , ' i have 56 world records , you 're going to try and beat it			1
you got ta get after me			2
' " @entity33 was one of a vanguard of young female swimmers who ruled the waves at last year 's games			0
@entity81 's @entity80 took two gold medals and stunned the world with her record - smashing swim in the final of the women 's 400m individual medley , while @entity88 , an unassuming @entity89 , breezed to gold in the 100m breaststroke at the tender age of 15			1
but it was @entity33 who made the biggest splash , clinching four gold medals and a bronze to announce herself as swimming 's coming force			1
" i shocked myself ! " explains @entity33			0
" i did n't have any of those expectations going in whatsoever , i was just happy to be there			0
happy to be on an amazing @entity66 team and to be able to call myself an olympian was a huge achievement in itself			0
" after that i just wanted to get out there and make my country proud			0
that was my only goal , whatever came with it came with it -- and that happened to be five medals			2
i could n't have planned it any better			0
" with unexpected success comes new expectations -- and tough decisions			2
notably she decided to postpone turning pro , temporarily spurning the possibility of earning millions of dollars in endorsements to become arguably the world 's most marketable collegiate athlete			2
she also swapped @entity15 for @entity124 , choosing to swim for the @entity125 's " @entity126			0
" she plans to join the professional ranks after the 2015 @entity128			0
juggling swimming with academia is now her biggest concern			1
" it 's very difficult , it 's super hard , " says @entity33			0
" i 'm done with high school , which is super sad to think about because i 'm going to miss it so much			2
" you hear about what the @entity66 can do for someone 's career , but it 's unbelievable how much it really does			0
i 've been able to meet the most incredible people and i think that 's been the best part			0
" going to the @entity20 and the @entity144 ( @entity146 awards ) , seeing my favorite actors and actresses and singers , going to all of these events and meeting other incredible athletes			0
it 's been life - changing			2
" all the work is very hard to keep up with , but all my teachers and my friends are awesome at helping me catch up with homework			0
" it 's all about time management			0
swimming has to happen and homework has to happen , so it 's figuring out how to get those things to work together			2
" another role @entity33 has taken on is to encourage others to take up water - based sports			0
she spoke to @entity0 from the set of " @entity166 , " a film she is making with fellow @entity42 swimmer @entity169 -- a @entity171 gold medalist -- aimed at encouraging people with physical disabilities to take up scuba diving			1
" we 're making an inspirational documentary about helping people with physical disabilities find a passion for scuba diving , " said @entity33			0
" to help them realize that , even if you have a disability , it does n't mean you ca n't do these things -- you might just have to do it a little bit differently			0
" you can be free , you can let go of everything			0
that 's one of my favorite things about swimming , no matter how hard my day was or how tired i am , i can just get into the pool and it does n't matter			2
" we 're all equal when we get into the water , it 's just us and the water			0
the water treats us all exactly the same			0
" despite those sentiments , @entity42 swim fans will be hoping " @entity1 " is without equal when she takes to the pool in future @entity66 .			1
