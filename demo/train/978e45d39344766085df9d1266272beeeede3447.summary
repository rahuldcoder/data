editor 's note : below is a chapter from @entity5 executive producer and author @entity6 ' new book , " @entity8 : @entity10 's @entity9 and the @entity11			1
" this excerpt recounts a trip @entity9 made to @entity14 in november 2007			2
@entity9 , founder of @entity10 , is pictured in @entity14 in november 2007			1
( @entity5 ) -- the group would be met by a @entity10 security team in @entity17 , @entity14			1
they would be escorted from one meeting to another with employees of the @entity22 , the @entity23 , and the @entity24			2
@entity9 wanted to know how his company was being perceived half a world away from the @entity28 media			1
in addition to the contracts with the @entity23 and with defense for airlifting supplies to troops , @entity10 had guards working for the @entity22 at the @entity36 embassy annex in @entity17			2
finally , his men trained @entity14 for border patrol and narcotics interdiction			0
all four contracts needed to be handled with care , given the new controversies the company faced			0
@entity9 had realistic hopes of gaining some new business			2
clashes between coalition forces and the @entity48 along the country 's borders had been brutal , and @entity9 was already in the business of training @entity14 to stop the illicit flow of drugs that was believed to be funding the insurgency			1
surely more could be done			0
@entity14 was a big market for @entity10 , and @entity9 hoped he could expand his business on this trip			1
... the 2Â½ - hour flight to @entity17 was packed with a combination of contractors , military types and some random folk who looked as if they had stepped off a movie set			2
in fact , just a few rows behind @entity9 sat a bald actor who had played a cameo role in an @entity70 movie			2
for @entity9 , the trip was not just about clients ; it was also a chance to meet some of the eclectic , modern - day soldiers of fortune who worked under him			1
@entity9 and his companions were met on the ground by a two - vehicle @entity10 team led by former @entity81 special agent @entity79			1
after his earlier work for the bureau investigating the embassy bombings in @entity85 and @entity86 , he had become @entity10 's regional director of training in @entity14 in 2003 for the @entity88 and @entity14 narcotics interdiction contracts , as well as the @entity14 border police training programs			1
@entity92 knew everyone in @entity17			0
he liked his job , particularly because he was one of the few men who could live in @entity14 with his wife , a @entity98 beauty whom he 'd met years earlier during his @entity81 days in @entity100			0
@entity101 , as she liked to be called , now ran @entity10 's administrative efforts in the country , including the oversight of some 40 local nationals			1
@entity92 greeted the boss with a handshake and a bulletproof vest			0
there had been a suicide bombing in the capital that morning , and at least a few people were killed			0
it happened not far from @entity10 's safe houses , and some of the employees had gone to the roof to get a better look at the huge plume of smoke rising from the site of the attack			1
suicide bombings were becoming more common in the capital , even in broad daylight in crowded areas where security was present			0
@entity48 insurgents were wiring up @entity14 who were mentally or physically disabled , the underprivileged who would sit along the side of the busy streets hoping for someone to drop money into their laps			0
when a @entity36 convoy or other acceptable target got close enough , militants would remotely detonate their victims			0
@entity9 put on his vest for a five - minute ride to the other side of the airport			1
one of his planes was being prepared to take him to the country 's largest airfield , where his own pilots were based			0
there were armed security guards in each of the two @entity150 , but @entity9 kept his own @entity151 on the seat next to him			2
he kept his eyes open as the convoy moved along the crowded @entity17 streets , where fresh meat carcasses hung out to dry and barefooted kids played in the narrow , dust - ridden alleyways			2
he particularly watched for teenagers on cell phones , standing on corners			0
he had seen intelligence information suggesting teens were being paid by insurgents to scout out @entity166 convoys and report their coordinates for a possible attack			0
once safely inside the airport 's perimeter , @entity9 and his team made their way to the @entity10 plane sitting on the tarmac			1
he greeted his pilots and asked how things were going			0
they assured him that the @entity24 was happy with the job they were doing			0
despite the crash of @entity181 61 into the side of a mountain two years earlier , @entity179 had continued to sign contracts with the @entity186 several times since then , including a $ 91 million - a - year contract to provide air support in @entity189			0
@entity9 's company had eight @entity192 aircraft in @entity14 , working for the @entity24			1
his men flew everything from drug eradication missions to bundle drops			0
many of them were high - risk flights from forward operating bases in the countryside			0
if there was an architect of the @entity36 invasion of @entity14 , it had been the @entity23			0
while @entity9 had used his connection to @entity208 , the former executive director of the @entity23 , to get his first black contract for security work , the agency had continued to renew @entity10 's work , even after @entity208 left			1
at the secret @entity23 post , @entity9 met with a handful of his men who had come to greet him			1
several of them looked as if they had walked out of an @entity218 convention : long hair , plaid flannel shirts and baggy pants worn much further down than pants were meant to be worn			0
@entity9 , in keeping with his conservative upbringing , gave some of them a hard time about their appearance , but they insisted it was what worked best among the local population			2
@entity9 's men had apparently made the @entity23 happy , providing static security and performing unknown other tasks			1
but some in the @entity235 suspected that @entity9 's @entity179 had operated rendition flights for the @entity23 , and said so in a report			1
an attorney for @entity9 pressed the @entity235 for proof to support such a claim , but proof never materialized			2
the attorney insisted the statements in the report were false and demanded a correction			0
while the possibility of @entity9 's companies taking part seemed plausible , @entity9 denied it ever happened			1
... eight deputies of gen. @entity249 , the general in charge of the @entity14 border police , were already waiting in a large office on the second floor of the two - story building when @entity9 arrived			1
he took a seat on a large sofa and listened as the general , through an interpreter , gave him an update on just how @entity10 's training program was working out			2
@entity9 's men were responsible not only for training the @entity14 force in firearms procedures , but for equipping them as well			1
it was the " one - stop shopping " that @entity9 had put into place for his law enforcement and @entity266 clients back at @entity10 's @entity268 facility so many years earlier			1
" make yourself indispensable to the client , " he had said , " and you 'll always have work			0
