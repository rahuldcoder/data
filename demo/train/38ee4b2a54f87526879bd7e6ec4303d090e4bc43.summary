a dispute over public prayers at town board meetings will be taken up by the @entity3 in coming months , another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the public arena			1
the justices announced monday the court will decide whether a @entity11 community may continue what it calls " inclusive " prayers at its town board sessions			1
the petition will be argued later this year or early in 2014 , with a ruling ready by the spring			0
after the @entity16 , @entity11 , @entity18 's policy was challenged because virtually all of those invited to offer prayers were @entity22 , the board for a time invited a few others , including a @entity26 , to offer invocations			1
but when that practice appeared to end , local citizens @entity29 and @entity30 sued			1
a federal appeals court found the board 's policy to be an unconstitutional violation of the @entity36 , which forbids any government " endorsement " of religion			1
the town board then asked the @entity3 to intervene			1
@entity29 and @entity30 say the board of the town outside @entity43 almost always invited @entity45 clergy to open the meetings , usually with sectarian prayers			1
the plaintiffs said in court papers they were non-christian and felt " marginalized " by the practice			0
@entity51 , the @entity52 - based group that is representing the two women , cited records showing that between 1999 and 2010 , approximately two - thirds of the invocations contained the words " @entity58 , " @entity58 , " @entity59 , " or " @entity60			0
" and the lawsuit claims that from 1999 through 2007 , every meeting had a @entity45 - only invocation			0
following the complaints from the plaintiffs , four other faiths were invited in 2008 , including a @entity68 leader and a @entity70 lay person			0
@entity29 and @entity30 say the @entity45 - only invocations resumed from january 2009 through june 2010			0
the plaintiffs then launched their legal fight , saying those invited to the monthly meetings were selected by a city employee from a local guide that had no @entity79 faiths listed			2
" a town council meeting is n't a church service , and it should n't seem like one , " said the rev. @entity80 , @entity51 executive director			1
" @entity83 ca n't serve everyone in the community when it endorses one faith over others			2
that sends the clear message that some are second - class citizens based on what they believe about religion			0
" while the 2nd @entity95 in @entity11 last year unanimously ruled against the city 's policy , other courts around the country have found such invocations -- if inclusive and limited in scope -- to be permissible			1
the @entity100 regularly opens its sessions with a prayer			0
friday 's invocation by @entity104 the rev. @entity105 began : " loving and gracious @entity107 , we give you thanks for giving us another day			0
help us this day to draw closer to you so that , with your spirit and aware of your presence among us , we may all face the tasks of this day			0
" forty - nine members of @entity100 , mostly @entity114 , along with 18 state attorneys general have filed supporting legal briefs backing the city			2
the @entity118 , a " legal ministry " based in @entity119 , @entity120 , filed the lawsuit on behalf of the @entity122 , saying the @entity3 has upheld the practice of government bodies " to acknowledge @entity126 's religious heritage and invoke divine guidance and blessings upon their work			2
" " a few people should not be able to extinguish the traditions of our nation merely because they heard something they did n't like , " said @entity131 , an attorney for the group			1
" because the authors of the @entity140 invoked @entity107 's blessing on public proceedings , this tradition should n't suddenly be deemed unconstitutional			2
" but the 2nd circuit appeals court concluded @entity16 officials were not diligent enough in efforts to find a more diverse set of voices from other faiths to open the public sessions , suggesting " a single religious sect " was being advanced			1
the high court is now being asked to offer more firm guidelines over when and if such public prayers are constitutionally acceptable			0
the case is @entity16 , @entity155 v. @entity29 ( 12 - 696 ) .			0

a @entity11 community has what it calls " inclusive " prayers at its town board sessions
some local citizens sued and a federal appeals court found the policy unconstitutional
" a town council meeting is n't a church service , " the legal group backing the citizens says
" a few people should not be able to extinguish " the nation 's traditions , the other side says
