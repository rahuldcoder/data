-- on a recent @entity3 flight , a man dropped his pants and exposed himself to the female passenger sitting next to him , then punched her , according to an @entity7 affidavit			1
the plane was in midair , and the naked man reportedly grew angrier , screaming uncontrollably and shaking his fist in the air			1
in august , a man on @entity3 exposed himself and punched a fellow passenger , an @entity7 affidavit says			1
the man had gone " berserk , " said @entity17 , a 52 - year - old passenger who witnessed the august incident			1
" he was jeopardizing my safety on that airplane			2
i was afraid he would rush the cockpit or try to jump out			2
" laws prohibiting interference with flight crews and attendants on aircraft have been on the books for decades			0
but since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , federal officials and airlines have clamped down on misconduct , imposing bigger fines and stricter punishments for passengers who behave badly			1
" now people are more hyper - vigilant on what occurs on aircrafts , " said @entity35 , assistant section chief for the @entity7 's violent crimes unit , who calls airplanes a " high - risk " environment			1
" the @entity44 government is more aware of what can occur on an aircraft , and [ officials ] do n't want those issues causing the plane to be in an unsafe environment			1
" the @entity7 reports an average of 80 incidents aboard aircraft each year			1
the man on the @entity3 fight , @entity54 , was charged in @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 with interference with a flight crew and accused of exposing himself			1
if convicted , he faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a $ 250,000 fine			1
the @entity62 , which handles unruly incidents deemed to be civil violations , has reported more than 900 cases over the past five years			1
in 2000 , a series of incidents in which passengers verbally harassed and hit crew members prompted the @entity62 to boost the civil penalty fine for interfering with a crew member from a maximum of $ 1,100 to $ 25,000			1
the @entity7 usually handles more serious cases of abuse or dangerous behavior			1
the @entity62 numbers do n't reflect all the cases of inappropriate behavior , said @entity79 , a spokesman for the agency			1
crew members are used to experiencing the wrath of passengers who are frustrated by delays and missing baggage			0
sometimes , these incidents are n't severe enough to be reported to government officials			2
many confrontations occur when a flight attendant refuses to serve an intoxicated passenger another alcoholic beverage , according to flight attendants			2
when the temper tantrums get physical , airline officials may resort to plastic handcuffs and restraining tape			2
on a @entity99 flight in july 2007 , passenger @entity97 was seen physically abusing her children , who were crying , according to court documents			2
the court records show that when the flight attendant refused to serve her alcohol , @entity97 threw her drink at the attendant			0
crew members subsequently taped @entity97 into her seat , and she spent three months in jail for the incident			0
passengers who fail to comply with standard airline policies -- such as staying seated when the seat - belt sign is on or turning off electronics when the plane is landing -- also spark confrontation , airline attendants said			0
@entity118 , a @entity119 passenger onboard @entity120 in 2008 , decided to smoke in her seat last summer despite the no - smoking law implemented on @entity44 flights in 1990			1
court documents revealed that when flight attendants asked @entity118 to stop , she began to yell obscenities and racial slurs			0
the flight was diverted to @entity128 , @entity129			0
@entity118 later was sentenced in @entity56 in @entity128 to serve five years ' probation for interference with a @entity120 flight crew member			2
@entity118 was ordered to participate in anger management and drug and alcohol abuse treatment as well as fined nearly $ 8,000			2
@entity136 , an @entity137 spokesman , reported a slight decrease in the number of incidents of misconduct this year compared with last year			0
the number of unruly passenger incidents tracked by the @entity62 also has dipped since 2004			1
the punishment for unruly behavior can be severe			1
in addition to federal charges , fines and jail time , passengers who are prosecuted may be liable for paying to divert a flight to an unscheduled airport , which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars			1
depending on the offense , the unruly passenger may be banned from the airline permanently			1
but some passengers said they believe the airlines and government are reacting too harshly			0
" you ca n't have a dispute on board an airline with the flight crew period , " said @entity159 , ceo of @entity160 , a security consulting group			0
" in some instances , it 's a good thing			0
but others will say it is a violation of my first amendment rights			0
" several airlines require their attendants to take courses on how to defuse confrontations and calm passengers who make belligerent threats			0
" we have all accepted that when we chose this career path our job is to be a safety professional , " said @entity179 , national safety and security coordinator for the @entity182 , an organization that represents attendants at @entity137			0
" i 'm the eyes , ears and nose of the aircraft to report everything to the cockpit			0
the service part , that 's just a bonus of our job			0
" @entity197 , an aviation consultant and flight attendant for two decades , said flying conditions have become more strenuous			0
few airlines serve meals on domestic flights , and snacks and drinks are carefully rationed			2
the seating space is smaller , leaving passengers feeling crunched			0
there are more delays , fees and less fresh oxygen on board , she said , which can trigger angry behavior			2
@entity197 said she has seen the quality of customer service dwindle since september 11 as some crew members have shorter tempers in dealing with passengers who disobey the law			1
" listening helps , " @entity197 said on the skills she used to deal with rowdy passengers			0
just being heard makes a big difference			0

@entity62 reports more than 900 cases of unruly behavior on planes over past five years
last month , a man reportedly exposed himself to passenger on @entity3
@entity7 officials say bad behavior less tolerated on flights after september 11 attacks
unruly behavior can bring civil fines up to $ 25,000 or *criminal* charges
