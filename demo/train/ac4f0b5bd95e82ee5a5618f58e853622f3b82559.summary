-- @entity1 survived an investigation by race stewards to claim a controversial pole position for the @entity5 saturday ahead of disgruntled @entity7 teammate @entity6			1
they ruled there was " no evidence of any offence " after several hours of mulling over an incident which happened at the back end of the qualifying session			0
both men were on their last flying laps when @entity1 lost control of his car and took to the escape road at @entity20			2
@entity6 , who was behind him and two hundredths of a second ahead on the first sector timings , was forced to slow up as yellow flags were waived and eventually abandoned his effort			2
it meant @entity1 's one minute 15.989 clocking from his penultimate run gave him first place on the grid , with @entity6 0.059 seconds slower from a previous effort			1
but it left @entity6 clearly fuming and insisting at the post-qualifying press conference that he was " on target " to take pole before his teammate went off			1
@entity1 claimed he had " tried to push just that little bit more and went over the edge , " refuting any suggestion that it had been a deliberate ploy to deny @entity6 his chance of pole			1
the @entity42 , who lives in @entity44 , was nevertheless delighted to have taken pole on the famous circuit for the second straight year			0
" i 'm really , really happy -- to be on pole at home is fantastic , it could n't be better , " he added			0
behind the all - conquering @entity7 pair it was @entity53 @entity52 who again got the better of @entity56 teammate and four - time defending champion @entity57 for third and fourth on the grid			1
two - time former world champion @entity59 will occupy the third row ahead of his @entity62 teammate @entity61			0
@entity64 @entity63 of @entity65 and @entity67 rookie @entity66 of @entity68 were seventh and eighth fastest			0
another rookie , @entity70 @entity69 in the second @entity65 was ninth and @entity72 @entity71 completed the top 10 for @entity73			0
@entity6 leads @entity1 by three points in the title race after winning the last four races , but pole position on the tight street circuit in @entity44 virtually guarantees victory come sunday 's race			1
@entity1 took the season - opener in @entity53 when @entity6 failed to finish , but has had to settle for second place to the @entity83 in the last four rounds , with signs of tension between the two men in their own private battle for the world championship			2
after the late incident the atmosphere in the interview area appeared distinctly frosty with 2008 champion @entity6 giving short answers to questions on the subject			2
