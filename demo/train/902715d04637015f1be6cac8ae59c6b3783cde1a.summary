@entity0 , @entity1 -- i never imagined i would find myself in @entity1 , on the outskirts of the brutal civil war in @entity6			1
as a 32 - year - old woman from @entity8 , i did n't know what to expect			1
when i got on the plane last week , it seemed that @entity13 or allied airstrikes on @entity6 were imminent , and honestly , it was pretty scary			0
but the fear i felt about the possibility of airstrikes was put into perspective when i met 7 - year - old @entity18 in a @entity6 refugee camp on the @entity1 border with @entity6			1
i will never forget the first time i looked into his eyes			0
the sadness and fear i saw there were years beyond his age , reflecting the extreme violence and horror he has witnessed -- sights and sounds of war that most of the world will only see in the movies			0
@entity36 : at refugee camp , nothing makes sense for the seven days i was there , most of the kids in the camp followed us in a gaggle , circling us at times , giggling and practicing their @entity47 -- " hello " and " thank you			2
" they loved to see their images on my camera 's display screen after i took their picture .			0

@entity2 *producer* @entity55 spent a week at a @entity6 refugee camp in @entity1
7 - year - old @entity18 's story *dramatizes* the pain , worry , *alienation* that refugees face
@entity18 left behind *comforts* of home ; in a 10 - by - 10 tent , he 's " the man of the house "
he 's *painfully* thin ; he says his last meal , just rice , was a day *ago*
