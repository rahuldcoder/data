an hour or so drive from the chaotic and congested streets of downtown @entity2 is a very different world			2
thousands of pristine new buildings -- many only half - built -- often within gated compounds are surrounded by miles of barren desert			1
new @entity2 is one of a handful of " satellite cities " that are being developed in the desert about 40 kilometers from the city center			1
the landscape is far from conventionally beautiful , but attracted the attention of a @entity15 photographer @entity14 who spent two years chronicling the developments			1
@entity2 's satellite cities have been developed on - and - off for 30 years , but a recent building boom has slowed since the fall of president @entity20 in february			1
@entity14 became interested after the @entity21 moved to a new campus in @entity2 in 2008			1
" i started to hear from students who were alarmed to find themselves in the middle of the desert , " he said			0
" i wanted to look for myself and was struck by the environment			0
" they were pristine buildings but with completely barren surroundings			0
you ca n't get there by public transport			0
i realized it had so little of what a city needs			0
" @entity14 spent two years photographing @entity2 's satellite cities and their construction sites			1
he said : " there were many projects i never saw any work on : half - finished construction sites where people with big ideas had run out of money			0
" others have been halted because of disputes and allegations of corruption over the sale of the land			0
" @entity14 added : " of all the areas i photographed , i would say 80 % were not occupied			2
" for centuries , the population of @entity2 -- now 10.9 million , according to the @entity53 -- was confined to a narrow strip of fertile land along the @entity57			2
in 1969 a development plan was launched to expand @entity59 into the surrounding deserts , according to a 2009 report by @entity62 , the @entity63 agency for human settlements @entity65 , a doctoral student who started a blog , @entity67 , on the city 's architecture and urban planning , has also taken an interest in satellite cities			1
he said the gated compounds of villas for the wealthy currently being built were opposite to the initial intention of satellite cities			1
@entity65 said : " the development of satellite cities has gone through several false starts			1
the initial idea in the 1970s was to respond to the housing crisis and create budget or social housing projects			0
the problem was that the poorest ca n't afford to live so far away without transport to bring them to work			0
" this initial phase was a complete failure and mostly remained vacant			0
there were further attempts in the 1990s			0
now we are seeing a reverse of the initial idea and they are exclusively high - end developments			2
" @entity95 said the gated compounds were being developed at the expense of preserving the historic city center			1
" there 's no recognition of @entity2 's architectural heritage and history , " he said			1
" it 's as if we 're living in @entity104 , but this is n't @entity104 , it 's a city that 's been around for 1,000 years			2
" @entity65 added : " the center of the city is deteriorating and the rich do n't want to be there anymore			0
they can afford to live outside the city and cut themselves off			0
" however , @entity65 said that despite having a combined population estimated at 1.5 million , the satellite cities had failed to ease the overcrowding of @entity2			1
he said : " the satellite cities are not working for many reasons			1
the main reason is that a housing bubble was created in the last five - to - eight years without the demand to fill them , leaving a lot of empty homes in the desert			2
" plus a lot of people who can afford these types of houses , already have second or third homes , so they are empty most of the time and it does nothing to help the housing crisis			0
" there has been a government policy that this type of development is a positive sign of progress and is to be encouraged , but that is very superficial because they are not really helping anyone			0
" @entity65 said the main cities with names such as 6 october and 15 may , as well as @entity2 , were each made up of many individual developments , some a further 15 or 20 minutes drive into the desert			2
working with the @entity2 - based journalist @entity148 , @entity14 produced a 6,000 - word photo essay on satellite cities , called @entity2 divided , in @entity151 and @entity152 , available for only the cost of postage and packing			1
" we had 5,000 copies printed and have had phenomenal interest from people interested in urban development , @entity2 itself , or global cities generally			2

@entity2 's satellite cities were first *conceived* more than 30 years *ago* to ease overcrowding
recently they have become home to exclusive gated compounds , often *standing* empty
photographer @entity14 spent two years *documenting* the developments in a project called @entity2 divided
