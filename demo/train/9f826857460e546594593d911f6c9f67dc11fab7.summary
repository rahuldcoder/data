the future of transport is self - driving cars , says gps inventor @entity3			1
the famed inventor , military hero and former boy scout , told @entity8 that advances in the use of @entity4 mean that the technology could not only emerge in the next few years , but is already being road tested by companies such as @entity13			1
" i think ( the future ) leads to robotic cars			1
i think there will come a time when you go down the highway and you do n't have to have your hand on the steering wheel at all			0
it 'll be a combination of gps , radar and other sensors			0
" if there is anyone who should know about the future of @entity4 , it is @entity3			1
the former air force colonel was an integral member of the team that invented gps technology			2
while he is now a professor emeritus at @entity33 in @entity34 , in the 1980s @entity3 headed up the gps program run by the @entity37 military			1
" when i invented the system i was a @entity37 colonel , " says @entity3			0
" i was in the air force and had a phd in aeronautics from @entity33 , and a master 's degree from @entity44			0
i 'd been testing inertial navigation systems for three years in my past and i had taken digital controls at @entity44			0
" the development of @entity4 was the product of a military program called @entity51			1
@entity3 had the idea that satellites could be used to help find and track targets to make weapon deployment more accurate			0
" i had flown combat , i understood the value of precision weapon delivery , i understood that it would be a humane use of a bomb if you could hit what you want to hit and not hit a mosque , hospital or school			0
" initially , the military was resistant to the idea , says @entity3			0
" the air force did n't want it because first of all they thought we could n't necessarily do it and secondly they are used to their old ways			0
and their old ways were , in essence , carpet bombing , it was very sad			0
" fortunately @entity3 found some powerful allies who helped drive the program forward			0
at a critical moment in the fledgling technology 's development , @entity82 , a physicist and @entity84 officer , introduced @entity3 to general @entity88 , whose personal interest in the program kept the research of gps alive			2
today , as well as being used by the military , geolocation is an indispensable civilian technology -- it can be found in car navigation systems and almost all smart phones			2
according to @entity3 , there are myriad possible uses for gps that are yet to be explored , but one of the most immediate applications will be the integration of gps technology into self - driving cars , which he believes will help bring down the incidence of road accidents			1
" the most dangerous thing in an automobile is the driver			0
usually because of distractions or because he does n't understand how slippery the road is			0
i 'm saying gps can absolutely be the key and cornerstone ... this is really exciting			0
" in the @entity37 we kill 40,000 people a year on the roads ... what can we do to help them ? i contend that automatically guided cars are going to help			1
it will include cooperation between cars ; i will know where the next car is going and will be able to sense how good the friction is on the road , i can sense whether my tires are slipping			2
i can do all that in an integrated single package , so i think where this is going is robotic automobiles			1
" self - driving cars are currently being trialled by companies such as @entity13 , whose driverless car is reputed to have already competed 400,000 miles of testing -- further than most motorists will travel in a lifetime			1
" as @entity13 has already demonstrated , robotic cars are already here , " says @entity3 , " but the version that they are using is far too expensive and cumbersome to be a practical product for general use			1
" as with most new technologies , @entity3 anticipates a ' trickle down ' effect whereby cutting - edge experiments being done at the top level will gradually be incorporated into everyday vehicles			1
" many of the elements of robotic driving are already being installed by leading manufacturers			2
for example , radar systems that measure the distance to the car that is ahead and begin slowing if the condition is hazardous			0
there is already a product that truck drivers can install in order to sense adjacent vehicles			2
" in september 2012 , @entity34 legalized self - driving vehicles			1
the new law obliges the @entity168 to draft regulations for autonomous vehicles by the beginning 2015 , meaning robot cars are unlikely to become available before that point			2
experts predict that the first self - driving cars may be on the roads by 2016 .			1

@entity4 is being integrated into the new technology of self - driving cars
robotic cars are already being tested on roads by companies such as @entity13
@entity34 has legalized self - driving vehicles
