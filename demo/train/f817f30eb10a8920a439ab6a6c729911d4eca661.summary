editor 's note : in @entity3 , we reveal the struggles faced by educators who teach subjects like science , math , @entity9 and history , and the solutions they 've found			1
in the last @entity3 story , teachers discussed their concerns about science education			2
it 's the best of times and the worst of times for @entity9 teachers as they find themselves more accountable than ever for the academic success of their students , while balancing new technologies that change time - honored practices of reading and writing			1
here are some of the modern challenges that language arts teachers face in their classrooms			2
tests are top priority the federal @entity35 law , passed in 2001 , requires states to set standards and assess students ' skills as they reach certain grades			2
since then , the @entity42 @entity41 reports that @entity9 language arts and math are tested more than any other subject area			1
that means @entity9 teachers feel extra pressure to have their students perform well on tests , even as they set aside other education goals			1
@entity50 , who teaches at @entity51 256 in @entity52 , said the pressure to achieve on tests has increased so much in the past 10 years that it influences how he shapes his lessons			0
rather than spend an entire class period on in - depth study of one book , he now spends a portion of each class on skill development for test taking			0
" we want the student to be able to switch on and off the right strategy for the right prompt			0
it can be effective for taking a test , " @entity50 said			0
" but as far as the learning environment goes , it 's like training a musician to announce the chords he or she is playing			0
" not every @entity9 teacher has found success with that model , though			1
in @entity77 's suburbs , @entity75 teacher @entity74 has a different approach			0
" we 've moved away from specifically teaching to the test , because if you teach the curriculum , you should be hitting what the test is asking the student , " she said			2
@entity86 , an eighth - grade teacher in @entity87 , @entity88 , said results on the statewide tests are really a report card on whether students had a good day on the day they took the test			1
everything she does , she said , comes down to three days of testing for which her school receives a grade			1
@entity99 , a teacher at @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , said it 's problematic to judge schools by students ' ability to meet minimal testing requirements			1
under the @entity35 law , underperforming schools are put on notice to improve or face reorganization			0
" i do n't have a problem with teaching to the test , if the test is a good measure of what it said it 's going to measure , " @entity99 said			2
do n't forget to write -- and read , too because time spent reading at home varies from student to student , kids come into language arts classrooms with varying skills			1
that means teachers have to make accommodations for the best readers , the weak readers and , in some cases , those who are just learning to speak @entity9			1
@entity99 , who teaches students in the 11th grade , said educators should n't limit reading requirements to books that students can relate to			1
academic reading is done for a different purpose than leisurely reading , he said			2
" i 'm unapologetic about what i ask them to read , " he said			0
@entity74 , from @entity142 , teaches two novels per year in her middle school classroom , and she maintains a separate reading list to help students choose additional books			1
" all students are reading different books at different times , " she said			1
through mini-lessons , she brings those books into the classroom discussion			0
for example , when they are studying active verbs , students will have to find examples in their individual books			0
" it 's harder , time-wise , but in the end they are learning more , reading and writing more , " @entity74 said			0
@entity162 , of @entity163 in @entity52 , has her students do writing workshops where they edit , provide feedback and revise the papers of their fellow students			0
students learning @entity9 need more time to give feedback , and generally need to attend after - school writing sessions in order to catch up			1
" it 's not necessarily the case that @entity9 as a @entity177 students are not as good at doing this , " @entity162 said			1
" in fact , they sometimes work even harder in order to compensate for a deficiency			0
" but as teachers assign more writing , they set themselves up to spend more time grading papers and have less time to teach			1
@entity162 recently took her students to see the musical " @entity188 " and assigned students to write a review of the show , a monologue for one of the characters and a reflection on the process			0
with a class size of more than 50 students , that generated about 150 papers for @entity162 to grade			1
technology for good , and for bad when @entity204 went to elementary school , encyclopedias were her main research tool			1
now , students in her fifth - grade class in @entity209 , @entity142 , use the internet for research			1
" it 's just so wide open as to what 's available to them , " she said			0
then , there 's the whole video game component			0
when children read , @entity204 said , they take the words on the page and create pictures in their minds			0
but video games provide visuals with the story , so students do n't use their imagination			2
just as everyday use of computers has increased , language arts learning has become more intertwined with technology			2
students naturally turn to computers for research and writing in ways they would n't have a decade ago			1
@entity99 , from @entity102 , said technology can be a distraction			2
while research has been redefined by the @entity210 , his emphasis continues to be on teaching his students to take that information and synthesize it with their own ideas			2
" many of us thought the digital revolution was going to expand students ' worlds because , theoretically , it could give them access to the globe , " said @entity243 , past president of the @entity244			0
instead , she said , social networking sites like @entity253 have contracted students ' worlds			0
" they 're just telling people just like them that they had their nails done or that they drank a cappuccino , " she said			0
in @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity260 said she prefers to have her fifth - graders hand - write their assignments first			0
at that age , students are weak typists , and their creative flow is easily broken if they are hunting and pecking for letters on the keyboard , she said			0
while older students tend to have access to computers in classrooms or computer labs , often there are n't enough computers for each student , so they have to share			1
@entity162 has access to a cart that contains 16 computers , but even if they all worked , there would n't be enough of them for classes of more than 30 kids			2
the shortage of computers makes it difficult for students to research and write during class , @entity162 said			1
" it 's hard to maintain a model of writing workshop and maintain the level of expectation for the student , " she said .			0

many @entity9 teachers say testing drives how and what they teach
in *higher* grade levels , students ' reading levels vary *dramatically*
technology can help with research , but using it too much can hurt students , teachers say
computers can be more of a distraction if there are n't enough available
