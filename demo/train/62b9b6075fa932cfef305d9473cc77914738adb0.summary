april 23 is , according to some reports , @entity2 's birthday			2
in a nod to the @entity2 's enduring legacy 450 years on from his birth , as well as the @entity8 's theatrical history , here are a few stages worth seeing , whether a play 's being performed or not			2
@entity11 ( @entity12 ) the original @entity11 theater was built by @entity2 's company , the @entity14 , in 1599 , but was destroyed by fire in 1613			1
a replica was built in 1997 just meters from the original site , with historical records used for guidance			0
though almost identical in appearance to the original , the new 857 - seat structure has several modern features , including roof - based sprinklers and a concrete theater pit , as opposed to the straw - strewn one that would have existed in 1599			1
one feature faithfully recreated is the roof -- @entity31 has the first and only thatched roof permitted in @entity12 since the great fire of 1666			0
@entity31 , 21 new @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity12 ; +44 20 7902 1400 the @entity36 ( @entity37 , @entity38 ) the history of this @entity38 theater dates to 1818 , when @entity41 presented it to the residents of @entity37 as a gift			1
the modern theater that now stands on the original site was built in the late 1960s			2
its curved , undulating lines are designed to resemble a theater curtain			2
architect @entity51 's design was chosen in a competition			2
the @entity36 , @entity53 1 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; +49 211 85230 @entity54 ( @entity55 ) the @entity54 was built in 1924 and named after @entity58 explorer @entity56 -- the first @entity59 to discover the @entity60			1
the property fell into disrepair , but in 2002 a major restoration began			0
a replica of the theater 's sign , depicting @entity56 's ship , was created using original colors identified from photographs , and stencils were used to painstakingly recreate the tapestry design that once adorned the walls			1
" after a $ 26 million renovation , this elegant vaudeville theater has been fully restored , complete with its one - of - a - kind , fully operational interior waterfalls , " says @entity73 at the @entity74			1
" if you could sum up the beauty of the @entity55 in a single design , this would be it			0
" @entity54 , 868 4th ave. , @entity55 ; +1 619 570 110 @entity85 theater ( @entity86 ) the @entity85 opened in 1904 as a venue for @entity89 plays , vaudeville revues and musicals			1
it was converted into a cinema in 1942 , before dancer @entity93 commissioned architect @entity94 to refurbish the interior so it could operate as a theater again			2
today 's structure incorporates the original columns and water - stained ceilings , giving the venue a @entity101 feel			1
" the 1987 restoration preserved the ornate detail and retained its historical associations , while rebuilding the stage and stripping it out to the bare brick back wall , " says professor @entity102 at @entity104 's theater arts program			1
" it was one of the most exciting theater renovations of the past three decades			2
" @entity85 theater , 651 fulton st. , @entity114 , @entity86 ; +1 718 636 4100 @entity115 ( @entity116 ) forget cement and plasterboard -- @entity121 's @entity120 theater was constructed in 1983 from 400 - year - old bishu - hinoki cypress trees			1
it 's open on three sides and the seating spreads out from the stage in a fan shape			1
despite the traditional elements there 's plenty of tech -- each seat has a personal subtitling system that can be changed from @entity121 to @entity134 at the touch of a button			1
@entity120 ( meaning " skill " or " talent " ) is a form of traditional @entity121 musical drama , and plays often last all day			1
@entity115 , 4 - 18 - 1 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity116 ; +81 3 3423 1331 @entity143 ( @entity144 ) the @entity143 , also known as the @entity143 , was built in the late 1600s			1
the grand staircase is lined with busts of important figures from the theater 's past -- the bust of @entity152 playwright @entity151 is rather worn , due to the belief that touching it will bring good luck			1
" it 's the archetypal theater -- a womb - like curve of red plush and gold , " says professor @entity156 at the @entity157			1
" it 's also a living museum , containing objects , artifacts , paintings and sculptures of huge interest for the history of @entity152 theater , including the armchair actor @entity171 used in ' @entity172 ' just hours before his death			2
" the @entity143 , 8 @entity174 , @entity144 ; +33 1 44 58 15 15 @entity175 ( @entity176 , @entity8 ) the setting is so stunning at this cliff - edge theater that you might find yourself getting distracted			1
on the plus side , the roaring waves could be a blessing for those who 've forgotten to turn their phones off			0
the theater was the brainchild of the late @entity175 , who decided to allow her garden to be used by a local theatrical group			1
in 1932 , @entity193 , with the help of her gardener , hauled several tons of rock from the beach below and created a more permanent venue , which she opened to the public			2
today , there are performances between june and september , though the theater remains open all year round			2

it was designed by @entity209 architect @entity208 , but his decision to base his masterpiece on the work of @entity214 @entity213 resulted in a mishmash of @entity216 , @entity217 and art deco styles			0
the theater contains the second largest chandelier in the world and a priceless @entity227 organ , and is recognized by @entity228 , which has classified it as " a building of great historical significance and high architectural quality , the preservation of which is regarded as essential to our heritage			1
" @entity205 , 49 market st. , @entity206 , @entity209 ; +61 2 9373 6655 @entity233 ( @entity234 , @entity38 ) built in 1745 , the @entity235 - listed @entity233 is regarded as the finest baroque theater in @entity59			1
the stage has a depth of 27 meters and was the largest in @entity59 until 1871			2
much of the original materials remain ( including vast expanses of painted canvas and wood ) , along with original structures , such as the twin staircases that led up to the private box belonging to @entity246 of @entity247 and his wife , who commissioned the theater			0
these staircases were designed so the audience below could observe the couple 's ascension to their seats			0
@entity233 , @entity255 14 , @entity234 , @entity38 ; +49 9 21 7 59 69 22 @entity256 ( @entity257 , @entity258 ) there ca n't be many theaters located in the middle of the @entity263 rainforest , and the @entity256 is certainly the most spectacular			2
the theater was built in the late 19th century during a rubber boom and was designed by @entity217 architect @entity266			0
work took 15 years , largely thanks to the decision to source supplies from all over the world : the roof tiles came from @entity273 in @entity152 , stairs and columns were made of @entity217 marble and the steel walls came from @entity278			0
beautiful features include 198 chandeliers , which also came from @entity217 , and the central dome , covered in 36,000 ceramic tiles painted in the colors of @entity258 's national flag			0
@entity285 , @entity286 , @entity257 , @entity258 ; +55 92 3622 1880 @entity287 ( @entity144 ) the @entity287 was the most expensive building built in @entity144 during the second @entity152 empire ( 1852 - 1870 ) and was the setting for @entity292 's novel " @entity293			2
" the interior is filled with marble friezes , bronze busts and ornate light fittings -- the most famous of which is a six - ton chandelier			0
in 1896 , one of the chandelier 's counterweights crashed through the ceiling , killing an audience member -- an incident that inspired a scene in @entity292 's famous play			0

highlights include a 900 - pipe @entity227 and 99 bulbs embedded in the ceiling to resemble twinkling stars			0
it was regarded as one of the world 's most elaborate theaters when it was built in 1926 and the interior -- a somewhat garish explosion of flowers and angry gargoyles -- resembles a @entity329 courtyard			1
" the simplistic beauty of the @entity312 confirms that @entity213 was a genius at designing vaudeville houses , " remarks @entity73 at the @entity74			0
" but when you see the @entity309 with its complexity and elaborate atmospheric design , you realize @entity213 was also a mad genius			0
" @entity309 , 711 n franklin st. , @entity338 , @entity310 ; +1 813 274 8981 @entity339 ( @entity340 , @entity341 ) @entity339 is one of @entity59 's oldest working theaters -- it was built in 1731 with funds from the @entity345 , a @entity347 military order			0
it remained unscathed during both @entity349 , despite serving as a bomb shelter during the second , and many original features remain , including beautiful painted wooden panels and the silver leaf - adorned ceiling			0
@entity339 , @entity340 , @entity341 ; +356 2124 6389 @entity356 ( @entity357 ) if this tiny theater is anything to go by , bigger certainly does n't mean better			0
within this building visitors find stained glass windows , fireplaces , lots of brass , walnut and oak and a water - powered pipe organ			0
" it was built in 1889 by @entity370 as a memorial to the daughter of captain and mrs. @entity374 , " says @entity73 at the @entity74			0
" this jewel box - like theater feels like it could have been inspired by a child 's doll house			1
