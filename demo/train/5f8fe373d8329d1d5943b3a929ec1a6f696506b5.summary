-- a veteran @entity2 representative from @entity3 is under fire for awarding charitable scholarships associated with the @entity6 to her family members and relatives of an aide			1
rep. @entity11 ( @entity12 ) has said she will repay all the scholarship money this week that went to relatives , a foundation spokeswoman told @entity0 's " @entity16			1
" @entity17 , the @entity19 ' @entity18 bureau chief , told " @entity16 " that new documents show @entity11 awarded scholarship money to her grandsons , @entity23 and @entity24 , as well as the children of her @entity27 district director , @entity26 , last year			1
each of the relatives were awarded two scholarships last year			2
@entity11 is a former chairwoman of the @entity6 and is a former board member of the @entity6 , which gives each member $ 10,000 every year to award as scholarships to students in each member 's district			1
the scholarship money comes from tax - deductible charitable donations			1
the newspaper reported that @entity11 has awarded more than $ 25,000 in scholarships to two grandsons , two great - nephews , and @entity26 ' children in the past five years			1
@entity45 received scholarships three years in a row , and @entity24 won scholarships four years in a row			0
@entity11 's great - nephew @entity50 received scholarships for three consecutive years , and her great - nephew @entity52 received money for two consecutive years			1
the @entity6 's rules state eligible students must attend school in the district of the caucus member and not be related to anyone affiliated with the caucus			2
in addition to violating the latter rule , none of @entity11 's nor @entity26 ' relatives who received scholarships lived in @entity11 's district , according to the newspaper			2
" @entity16 " invited @entity11 and @entity26 to appear on the show monday night , but was told they were unavailable			2
@entity71 , spokeswoman for the @entity6 , told @entity0 's @entity72 the organization is taking the situation very seriously			0
" rep. @entity11 told us that she did not know the rules of our scholarships , and that once she realized she erred , she would make retribution to the @entity6 in terms of returning the money , " she said			1
" this is the first time , to our knowledge , this has happened			0
" when asked about oversight and whether the foundation has ever investigated where the scholarship money goes , @entity72 said , " we 've had no reason to investigate			2
" she said the foundation 's board members will examine the situation , and board members will go back and review applications to ensure students met the qualifications			0
but @entity11 is a former board member of the foundation , and some wonder whether an independent investigator needs to be involved			0
" i ca n't address that issue , " @entity72 said			0
" all i can say is that we will send it back to our board			0
but certainly we do n't want this to happen again			0
" @entity11 has told the newspaper that when she signed off on the list of names of students who were to receive scholarships , she recognized the names , but also said , " immediate family does n't include grandchildren			1
" but according to her website , " congresswoman @entity115 counts among her greatest accomplishments her son , @entity24 , and her three grandsons , @entity24 , @entity23 , and @entity119			0
" @entity11 told the newspaper if there had been more " very worthy applicants in my district , " she probably would not have given the scholarship money to the relatives			1
some students in @entity11 's district may not have known the opportunity existed			0
unlike other members of the @entity6 , @entity11 does not publicize the scholarship on her website			1
scholarship applicants also have to sign off on an agreement saying they are not related to anyone associated with the caucus or the caucus foundation			0
it 's unclear whether the relatives of @entity11 and @entity26 were instructed to say they were not related			2
@entity11 is running for her 10th term as representative of @entity3 ' 30th congressional district , which covers parts of @entity27 and the surrounding area .			0
