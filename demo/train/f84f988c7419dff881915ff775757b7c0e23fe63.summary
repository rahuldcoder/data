-- @entity1 have drawn level with @entity4 's record by going 35 matches unbeaten , after second - half goals from @entity7 and @entity8 gave them a 2 - 0 @entity11 victory over host nation @entity12 in @entity13			1
the @entity15 players appeal for handball as @entity7 celebrates @entity1 's opening goal on saturday			1
the result ensures the @entity20 champions comfortably reach the semifinals of the competition as group winners , while @entity12 also progress to the last four after @entity24 and @entity25 draw 0 - 0 in saturday 's other @entity27 match in @entity28			1
@entity30 's side were last beaten in november 2006 and they will better @entity4 's unbeaten streak , achieved between 1993 and 1996 , if they win wednesday 's semifinal			1
@entity1 have also drawn level with @entity34 , @entity4 and @entity35 in winning 15 consecutive matches and victory on wednesday will ensure they break that record as well			1
after a goalless first half , the match exploded into life five minutes after the interval when @entity1 's @entity44 was crudely fouled in the area by @entity46 , who has just signed a contract with @entity48 and has regularly faced the @entity50 midfielder in the @entity51			2
in - demand @entity52 striker @entity7 stepped up to take it , but his spot - kick was superbly pushed away by goalkeeper @entity55 , diving to his right			0
however , @entity15 joy was short - lived as just a minute late @entity7 again showed what a class player he is when turning superbly to fire home @entity62 's inch - perfect through - ball			0
the @entity15 players claimed @entity64 controlled the ball with his arm before burying it into the far corner and tv replays seemed to indicate they had a valid argument for the goal to be disallowed			0
@entity7 's strike was his 31st goal in 47 international appearances , putting him just 13 off @entity78 's all - time @entity77 record			2
@entity1 , who look a class apart in this tournament and have qualified after winning all their three games without conceding a goal , secured the three points in the 71st minute when substitute @entity8 turned the ball home in a crowded goalmouth , after @entity90 's low free - kick from the right had been helped on by a @entity44 mis - kick			1
despite the defeat , @entity12 's participation in the tournament remains very much alive after @entity25 and @entity24 played out a dull stalemate			2
a two - goal @entity25 victory would have seen the host nation crash out , but the result was no great surprise as neither side managed to score a single goal in their three matches			2
sunday sees the remaining @entity105 matches played , with @entity106 and @entity107 battling it out to seemingly join @entity4 in the last four			0
however , no team is absolutely certain of qualification yet and all four sides in the group can still in theory go through			0
@entity4 face @entity106 in @entity114 and a draw will see the @entity116 definitely finish top of the group			0
however , an @entity120 victory will then turn the attention to the other match between @entity123 and the @entity124 in @entity125 .			0

@entity1 extend their unbeaten run to 35 matches with 2 - 0 win over @entity12
the @entity20 champions win all three of their @entity11 group games
@entity1 will set a new record of *36* unbeaten matches if they win their semifinal
