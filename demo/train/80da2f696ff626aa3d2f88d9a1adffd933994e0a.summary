-- @entity1 , photographers , smiles and tears of joy -- requisite wedding fixtures -- abounded sunday at @entity8 's @entity7			2
but for 133 couples , the day 's fanfare brought an extra dimension			1
after exchanging vows at five stations set up in @entity7 , they walked outside and down rain - slickened steps , greeted by cheers , confetti and a brass band celebrating the first day same - sex couples could marry in @entity20			1
" today was really about the state of @entity20 recognizing us , " said @entity21 , who married @entity22 , her partner of eight years			1
" people beyond our close friends and family saying our family is as valid as any other family			2
" after years of saying no at the ballot box , @entity32 voters for the first time said yes to same - sex marriage this fall in @entity20 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
the couples married sunday in @entity8 were among the first such couples in @entity20 to obtain marriage licenses thursday			1
" you are seeing all generations here , people fighting for equality for decades , " @entity41 , press secretary to @entity8 mayor @entity42 , told @entity0			2
" it 's a very happy day			0
" local businesses provided refreshments			0
musicians and photographers volunteered their services , @entity41 said			0
a city website featured interviews with couples , photos , live webcams and information on obtaining a marriage license			2
@entity60 , 44 , and @entity61 , 34 , of @entity8 were among those tying the knot in simultaneous services			0
" after a commitment ceremony ( this past summer ) we just thought we would go down to @entity7 , fill out paperwork and call it good , " said @entity60			0
" ( today ) you would hear bursts of applause			0
it was very festive and joyous , kind of an electric feeling in the air			0
" @entity60 and @entity74 expressed hope that the @entity32 @entity76 will issue rulings favorable to same - sex marriage			1
on friday , the justices said they will hear two constitutional challenges to state and federal laws dealing with the recognition of gay and lesbian couples to legally wed. oral arguments will likely be held in march with a ruling by late june			2
one appeal to be heard involves the federal @entity89 or @entity89 , which denies federal benefits to same - sex couples legally married in their own state			1
the second is a challenge to @entity96 's @entity95 , a voter - approved referendum that took away the right of same sex - marriage that previously had been approved by the state 's courts			1
before november 's vote , couples in @entity20 had domestic partner rights			1
@entity60 and @entity74 said they now feel full equality			0
" just being able to say @entity105 is my husband , not just my partner , " @entity60 told @entity0			0
approval of same - sex marriage in @entity20 contrasts with the 38 states that have passed bans on marriages between people of the same sex , mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman			1
in six states -- @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 -- and the @entity130 , gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights because of actions taken by judges or legislators , not voters			2
a milestone also occurred this year in the nation 's executive branch : president @entity139 became the first president to openly support same - sex marriage			1
these political trends emerged as a majority of @entity32 say they support legally recognizing same - sex marriage at a time when the public demonstrates increasing comfort with gays and lesbians , according to a @entity0 / @entity149 survey in june			1
@entity60 said he and @entity61 have had to deal with acceptance among some family members			0
" we 're in a great place , but it took awhile			0
" " i feel like we made history today , and i like the way history is going , " said @entity60			0
@entity0 's @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
