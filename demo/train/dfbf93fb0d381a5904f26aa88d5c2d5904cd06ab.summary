@entity0 , @entity1 -- an affidavit of probable cause in @entity1 's case against @entity6 for the shooting death of an unarmed 17 - year - old says that the neighborhood watch volunteer " profiled " the victim , @entity10 , and disregarded a police dispatcher 's request that he await the arrival of police			1
the affidavit , which was drawn up wednesday but not made public until thursday , was prepared by investigators for the state attorney , who charged @entity6 with second - degree murder wednesday			1
public documents in the @entity10 shooting @entity6 's relatives say that he did not profile @entity10 and that he shot him in self - defense			1
they say @entity6 killed @entity10 after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk			1
one of the responding officers reported seeing a wound on the back of @entity6 's head , and surveillance video appeared to show an injury			1
the affidavit offers little new about what happened on the night of february 26 , when @entity10 was returning to the @entity0 house where he was staying after having walked to a nearby convenience store , but it may offer some insight into how the special prosecutor views the case			1
" @entity10 then walked back to and entered the gated community and was on his way back to the townhouse where he was living when he was profiled by @entity6 , " the affidavit says			1
" @entity10 was unarmed and was not committing a crime			1
" it says that @entity6 , who lived in the same community , was in his vehicle when he saw @entity10 " and assumed @entity10 was a criminal			1
@entity6 felt @entity10 did not belong in the gated community and called the police			1
@entity6 spoke to the dispatcher and asked for an officer to respond because @entity6 perceived that @entity10 was acting suspicious			1
the police dispatcher informed @entity6 that an officer was on the way and to wait for the officer			1
" during the recorded call @entity6 made reference to people he felt had committed and gotten away with break - ins in his neighborhood			1
later while talking about @entity10 , @entity6 stated ' these a * * holes , they always get away , " and also said ' these f * * * * * * punks			1
' " as the incident was unfolding , @entity10 was on the phone with a friend , the affidavit says			1
" the witness advised that @entity10 was scared because he was being followed through the complex by an unknown male and did n't know why			2
@entity10 attempted to run home but was followed by @entity6 who did n't want the person he falsely assumed was going to commit a crime to get away before the police arrived			1
@entity6 got out of his vehicle and followed @entity10			1
when the police dispatcher realized @entity6 was pursuing @entity10 , he instructed @entity6 not to do that and that the responding officer would meet him			1
@entity6 disregarded the police dispatcher and continued to follow @entity10 who was trying to return to his home			1
" @entity6 confronted @entity10 and a struggle ensued			1
witnesses heard people arguing and what sounded like a struggle			0
" calls to 911 captured a voice crying for help ; that voice belonged to @entity10 , according to his mother ; the neighborhood watch volunteer 's relatives have said the voice was @entity6 's			1
" @entity6 shot @entity10 in the chest			1
when police arrived @entity6 admitted shooting @entity10			1
officers recovered a gun from a holster inside @entity6 's waistband			1
a fired casing that was recovered at the scene was determined to have been fired from the firearm			0
" the affidavit says that an autopsy determined that @entity10 died of the gunshot wound			1
asked thursday why his client had followed @entity10 , @entity6 's lawyer @entity105 told @entity2 sister network @entity107 , " i know so little about the evidence			1
" @entity105 , who began representing @entity6 on wednesday , said they had not yet discussed the facts of the case			2
immediately after the shooting , @entity0 police questioned @entity6 and released him without charges			2
they said then that there were no grounds to disprove his account that he 'd acted to protect himself			0
the affidavit was released the same day that @entity6 made his first court appearance thursday , wearing gray jail coveralls and saying little as his arraignment was set for may 29			1
@entity124 judge @entity123 , who spoke via a closed - circuit television connection during the four - minute hearing , said all matters including bond and further motions in the case will be handled by @entity132 judge @entity131			0
@entity105 did not ask that @entity6 be released on bond , although he had said earlier that he wanted his client released as soon as possible			2
he added , however , that @entity6 's safety could be jeopardized if he were released			1
" i think nobody would deny the fact if @entity6 is walking down the street today , he would be at risk , " he said			2
@entity6 , 28 , was in hiding until he turned himself in wednesday after authorities said he would be charged in the case			2
blog : updates on charges and arrest as they unfolded the case has triggered a nationwide debate about race in @entity148 and about @entity1 's " stand your ground " law , which allows the use of deadly force in response to a reasonable threat of death or serious injury			0
@entity105 said @entity6 , who will plead not guilty , is worried about getting a fair trial in @entity0 -- where thousands had decried the police department 's handling of the february 26 shooting			1
but @entity105 said he does not share those concerns			0
" @entity1 has a very good process in place to make sure we get a fair and impartial jury , " he told @entity2			0
" i trust that the system , the judge , the prosecutor and i will be able to , should the need arise , to get ourselves a fair and impartial jury to hear the case			0
it may not be in @entity124			0
" @entity10 's mother , @entity176 , released a statement on thursday seeking to clarify what she had said earlier on @entity179 's " today			2
" earlier , @entity180 had told @entity179 , " i believe it was an accident			0
i believe that it just got out of control , and he could n't turn the clock back			0
" in her subsequent statement , she said her comment had been " mischaracterized			0
" " when i referenced the word ' accident ' today with regard to @entity10 's death , in no way did i mean the shooting was an accident			2
" we believe that @entity6 stalked my son and murdered him in cold blood , " @entity180 said			2
" the ' accident ' i was referring to was the fact that @entity6 and my son ever crossed paths			2
it was an accidental encounter			0
if @entity6 had n't gotten out of his vehicle , this entire incident would have been avoided			2
" my son was profiled , followed and murdered by @entity6 , and there was nothing accidental about that , " she said			2
asked about @entity180 's comments , @entity105 said , " obviously , it was a horrible intersection of two young men 's lives , and it ended in tragedy			0
" share your views of the @entity10 story @entity6 was charged 46 days after the shooting and after calls for " @entity220 " had grown more forceful , with @entity10 's supporters taking to the @entity222 and to streets in cities across the nation			1
prosecutor @entity226 said she will ensure that the judge or jury deciding the case will get only " the relevant , admissible evidence on which they can then base their decisions			0
" " let me emphasize that we do not prosecute by pressure or petition , " said @entity234 , who has a reputation for taking on tough , controversial cases in the three counties that make up the 4th @entity132			0
@entity10 prosecutor lives up to ' tough on crime ' mantra a second - degree murder charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison			1
@entity248 , an attorney for @entity10 's family , praised the prosecutor 's decision			2
" it 's actually a very brave charge of @entity226 and really shows that she conducted an independent , impartial and fair investigation in this case , " the attorney said thursday			0
" she could have easily charged this as a manslaughter to try to appease everyone			0
" jurors will have several options under @entity1 law , including considering aggravating factors such as @entity10 's status as a child , @entity259 said			2
