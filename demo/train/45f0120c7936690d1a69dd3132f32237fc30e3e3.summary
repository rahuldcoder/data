@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 knew right away that the photo from their recent trip to @entity8 was a good one			1
@entity3 and @entity4 were taking a photo of themselves when the squirrel popped up			1
however , it was n't until the world -- and @entity14 -- took notice that they realized exactly how good			1
now , after submitting it to the magazine 's online " @entity21 " contest , the @entity1 couple 's photo is set to grace the pages of the magazine 's november issue			1
it 's appeared on the web sites of news outlets around the world , and the squirrel -- now dubbed " @entity30 " -- even has its own @entity32 entry of the same moniker			1
@entity34 and her husband @entity35 were hiking in @entity36 the last week in may when they decided to set up their camera and use their wireless remote shutter for a few shots of the two of them			1
they were getting situated on the rocky shore near @entity46 when the now - iconic critter stopped by for a visit			0
" the little squirrel had been running around while we were getting the shot set up , " @entity34 said in a phone interview tuesday			1
" i was joking with my husband that i hoped he was friendly because he was getting awful close and kind of scampering around our feet and stuff			1
" friendly ? you might say so			0
it was also a bit timid and perhaps even indecisive because it soon scurried away and then , just as quickly , rushed back again			0
" @entity62 " might also be a good word to describe it			0
" all of a sudden he popped back up because he heard the shutter releasing , the clicking of the camera			1
the only thing we can figure is that he thought it was going to give him food or something , " @entity4 said			0
" he popped right up and looked right into the camera , and we were laughing so hard because we were like ' get it , get it ! ' and we were trying to get the remote to fire			1
so we got a couple of pictures -- took a couple of pictures with him there , and then he ducked down and proceeded to run away			2
" the resulting image exceeded all expectations			0
" we did n't realize how good it was until we got back to the hotel that night and downloaded it to my husband 's computer , and when we could see it on the full screen we were like , ' whoa , are you serious ? ' " " we had no idea it was going to turn out exactly like it did with him being in perfect focus , us being out of focus , and then us just laughing in the background			2
we were n't sure if he 'd be standing like in front of one of us or something like that			1
" an international phenomenon @entity4 said she and her husband showed the photo to their friends and family and were subsequently incessantly prodded to " do something " with it			2
for months the two were n't sure what that something could be			2
that changed , however , when the latest issue of @entity14 arrived in the mail			1
" i saw the ' @entity21 ' contest , which of course i knew existed , but i had never thought of entering one of my own pictures into it , " @entity4 said			0
" i thought , ' this is what i 'm going to do ! ' " @entity4 said she submitted it on august 5 and by august 13 it was @entity126 's photo of the day			2
" things just kind of spun out of control from there			0
" the photo was soon published in the pages of two national @entity8 newspapers , and @entity4 received calls from a friend in @entity135 who 'd seen it on a local @entity135 news web site			2
the couple has since appeared on @entity140 's " today " show as well as the @entity142 ' local affiliate @entity141			2
and now that it 's been selected for publication in the november issue of @entity14 , the attention has n't subsided			1
as of this writing , @entity4 has received @entity148 messages from random fans in 29 different countries			0
the @entity148 group " nuts the @entity30 is a legend " comes complete with 5,300 fans and counting			0
the squirrel is also being used by @entity36 in advertising on its web site , and it has created a @entity36 squirrel @entity159 account			2
there 's even a web site dubbed " @entity163 , " which has apparently been created for people who feel their photos lack a certain " squirrel charm			0
" the site 's tool will paste the squirrel cutout onto any picture uploaded			0
other sites have pasted the squirrel onto various scenes from history , from the @entity175 at @entity176 to the @entity177			0
and it has n't stopped there			0
" it keeps popping up everywhere , like at my husband 's job , " @entity4 added			0
" if people are giving him a presentation , all of the sudden they 'll have a squirrel pop up			0
" authenticity assured it was during their appearance on " today " that host @entity191 raised questions about the possibility the photo could have been doctored			1
@entity4 assured him , as she did once more for @entity2 , that the photo is " completely authentic " but said she understood the skepticism because people had originally thought the photo was taken simply with a timer -- as opposed to the remote shutter she used in actuality -- which , if it were the case , would have kept the couple in focus and blurred the squirrel			1
" @entity14 looked at the full high - resolution [ image , and ] realized it was authentic , " @entity4 said , adding , " you ca n't make this stuff up			1

couple had set up camera to take their photo with mountains as backdrop
squirrel pops up in front of camera , is snapped
photo appears all over the @entity225 , will be in @entity14
on question of authenticity : " you ca n't make this stuff up , " woman says
