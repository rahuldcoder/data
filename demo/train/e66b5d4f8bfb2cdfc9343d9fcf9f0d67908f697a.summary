-- middle schooler @entity1 did n't expect to see her classmates cry when she decided to show them her big secret			1
she was bald and did n't know how to tell her peers			2
but after teaming up with her teachers , the @entity6 , @entity7 , student helped make a documentary about why she has no hair			1
now she is the face of bravery for her classmates			0
it all started after @entity1 wrote a letter to her school counselor : " i have a disease and it makes me lose my hair , " she wrote			1
the 11 - year - old was born with alopecia areata , an autoimmune skin disease that results in hair loss on the scalp and other places on the body			2
the condition affects 2 % of @entity26 , both male and female , according to the @entity28			0
people with alopecia generally start losing hair in their youth , which was the case for @entity1			1
at age 8 , she started seeing patches of her hair on the floor of the tub after taking showers and on her pillow after getting out of bed			0
with no real cure available , @entity1 went completely bald at 9			1
she sported a medium - length black wig throughout much of elementary school , but after graduating , she approached her mom and said she wanted to stop wearing it in middle school			1
she said the wig irritated her scalp , especially during gym activities , and she felt hot while wearing it			2
but most importantly , @entity1 says , she just wanted to be herself around her friends			1
" i was fearful she was going to get picked on			0
she was picked on a little in elementary school , " said her mother , @entity55			2
she had seen students questioning @entity1 about her condition , asking her why she was losing her hair and whether she was sick			1
@entity55 was nervous that by not wearing the wig to her new middle school , @entity1 would be subjecting herself to bullying and ridicule			1
bullying was something @entity55 was all too familiar with			0
after a high fever and ear infection , she lost her hearing at the age of 1 and grew up as the only deaf girl at her school			2
" i grew up in the ' 70s , " she explained			0
" the kids at school did n't know how to interact with me			2
they made fun of my voice			0
" it was the kind of experience she did n't want for her daughter			0
but @entity1 was determined to stop wearing her wig and approached her middle school counselor , @entity81 , about her condition in private			1
@entity81 had similar concerns that @entity1 might get picked on but worked with other teachers and the administration at @entity86 to figure out how to share @entity1 's story with the rest of her peers			1
with @entity55 's blessing , @entity81 and other school officials enlisted @entity1 's teachers to help create a short documentary about @entity1 and what it was like living with alopecia			1
" ( @entity81 ) thought that if you educate people and if you tell them about things and you tell them that it is n't contagious , that people wo n't pick on me , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 's science teacher , @entity102 , was one of the participants in the documentary			1
" i was a little bit surprised , " she said , when she learned that @entity1 wanted to tell other students she was bald			1
" most kids do n't come forward in middle school and do something like that			0
in middle school , kids can be a little harsh , and bullying can be a problem			0
but i wanted to support her in what she wanted to do , " @entity102 said			0
the documentary was screened this month in the school 's library for several groups of students , including @entity1 's class			1
" i was sitting at the back so all these people would n't be looking at me , " @entity1 said			2
" and i watched everyone , and people were crying , and i felt sorry			0
" i knew that maybe the teachers would cry , but i never expected that the kids would cry , " she added			0
her mother was also at the screening and had an interpreter translate the film for her			2
i think everyone in the room cried			0
i knew we made the right decision			0
the school was really supportive			0
they did n't have to do this , you know , " @entity55 said			0
after the documentary , @entity1 , accompanied by two of her teachers , answered questions from her peers			1
she also explained to her class that the following week she would not be wearing her wig anymore			2
" it was very inspiring , " @entity55 said			0
" the kids were really interested , and they asked a lot of questions like ' does it hurt ? ' and ' was your scalp itchy ? ' " many students were surprised by the film and admitted that they never suspected that @entity1 wore a wig in the first place			1
some students even told @entity1 that she looked even better without a wig			1
@entity55 could n't help but think of how brave @entity1 was , standing in front of her classmates and answering their questions			1
" she was just determined to do it			0
she wanted to be herself and not cover up and mask who she was			0
" the following week , @entity1 came to school with a hat instead of a wig			1
it 's winter in @entity6 , and she says her scalp gets cold without something covering it			0
@entity102 says her students are reacting normally to @entity1 without her wig			1
" i let my first period class ask her questions , and they did n't			0
everyone seemed ready to move on , " she said			0
looking back at the screening , @entity1 is happy with her decision to tell her classmates that she has no hair			1
" i want people to like me for me and not what i look like , " @entity1 said , " because that 's how i can find my true friends			2
