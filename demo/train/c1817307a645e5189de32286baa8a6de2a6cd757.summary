" lawyers for the men have pointed to a @entity57 ruling in 2013 which cleared the way for a second judicial review			1
however , @entity49 said that ruling was n't effective because the relevant regulations had n't been implemented			2
until they were , he said " we have to stick to the old rule that says judicial review is only possible for one time			1
" ' the @entity3 are not the only foreigners awaiting execution by an @entity5 firing squad			1
of 11 presidential decrees , eight relate to drug offenses			2
of those eight , seven are foreign nationals , including the two @entity3 , @entity49 said			1
the others are from @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , the @entity84 , and @entity85			0

" every day we have 50 people die because of narcotics , of drugs			0
in one year , it 's 18,000 people who die because of narcotics			0
we are not going to compromise for drug dealers			0
no compromise , " he said			0
the @entity136 has expressed concern about the use of the death penalty for drug offenses			2
" according to international human rights jurisprudence , capital punishment could only be applied to the crime of murder or intentional killing , " @entity136 spokesperson @entity141 told reporters			0
