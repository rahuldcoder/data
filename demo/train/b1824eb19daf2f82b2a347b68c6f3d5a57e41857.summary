few things are more ethereal than hope			1
it is n't tangible , easily measurable or available in pill form			0
that 's likely why the idea that hope may wield a significant influence on healing -- and even survival -- may be tough to take for our bean - counter brains , hardwired by evolution to seek certainty at any cost			1
@entity14 , author of the new book " @entity16 , " is unfazed by any such ambivalence			0
" i began my career by studying intelligence and how that relates to good health , " he says			0
" sometimes i found it easier to just tell people i was an intelligence researcher			0
they reacted like that research was somehow important and fancy			0
" when he talks about hope , people 's eyes glaze over more often than not			1
nonetheless , @entity14 believes hope is the stuff of change , recovery and healing			1
using downward dogs to treat depression the positive physiological effects of hope are well - documented , most eloquently in @entity39 's " @entity38 , " where he writes : " researchers are learning that a change in mind - set has the power to alter neurochemistry			1
" belief and expectation -- the key elements of hope -- can block pain by releasing the brain 's endorphins and enkephalins , mimicking the effects of morphine			1
in some cases , hope can also have important effects on fundamental physiological processes like respiration , circulation and motor function			1
" @entity39 's research showed that during the course of illness , belief and expectation -- two mental states associated with hope -- have an impact on the nervous system which , in turn , sets off a chain reaction that makes improvement and recovery more likely			1
this process , he points out , is fundamental to the widely accepted " placebo effect , " which is created by a hopeful outlook			0
it is less of a stretch to contemplate the link between hope and emotional well - being			1
" have you ever met a happy hopeless person ? " @entity14 asks simply			0
@entity39 observed that hope does not just involve a mind - to - body connection , but also a body - to - mind connection , where neural input about one 's physical condition serves as a moderator of positive and negative emotions			1
training the brain to stress less @entity94 , @entity14 says , may buffer us from stress , anxiety and the effects of negative life events			1
studies of workers over time suggest that hopeful employees experience more well - being			1
and it comes as no surprise that in a @entity109 poll of 1 million people , the hopeful said they laughed and smiled much more often than the hopeless , @entity14 writes , citing an " unpublished analysis of data from the @entity113 and the @entity114			0
" according to @entity14 , studies also show that hope promotes healthy behaviors , including fruit and vegetable consumption , regular exercise , safe sex practices and quitting smoking			1
" in each case , " writes @entity14 , " hope for the future is clearly linked with daily habits that support health and prevent disease			1
" that 's because hope triggers a virtuous cycle			1
hopeful people conjure a vision that sustains them , that causes them to show up for the hard work and accept setbacks , @entity14 says			1
they make an investment in the future that pays off in the present : in the way they eat , exercise , conserve energy , take care of themselves and stick to their treatment plan			0
the pathways of hope in 2008 , @entity149 , an associate professor of practical theology at @entity151 in @entity152 , set out to study hope among children suffering from chronic illness			1
" we felt there was insufficient theory about hope from children 's perspectives , " he says			1
" most of the research was based on and extrapolated from adult experiences and then applied to kids			0
" @entity149 and his colleague dr. @entity166 , a pediatric nephrologist at @entity167 in @entity168 , analyzed vast amounts of data from a diverse group of children suffering from end - stage renal failure			1
the researchers identified five main pathways to hope			2
they are : maintaining identity by continuing to participate in activities and relationships that help patients retain a sense of self outside diagnosis and treatment			0
realizing community through formal and informal connections that help patients understand they are not alone in living with disease			0
this community is made real through conversation , visitation , consultation and participation in daily activities			2
claiming power by taking an active role in treatment by setting goals , self - advocating , monitoring and maintaining one 's own health			2
attending to spirituality , activated through religious , spiritual and other contemplative practices			0
developing wisdom , which involves both gaining pragmatic , medical wisdom derived from one 's own experience and finding ways to " give back			0
" " the pathways are not hierarchical in any way , " @entity149 says			0
" you can access hope through any of these pathways and all of them			2
the more of them you can access , the better			0
" literature tends to treat hope as an existential experience , virtue or emotion , @entity149 says			2
but the children @entity149 studied revealed that hope is a social resource			2
it emerges through interactions with the people who surround us and is then internalized			0
what 's important , says @entity149 , is for the patient 's " team members " -- family members , doctors , nurses , social workers , friends and chaplains , among others -- to do things that help create and activate hope pathways for the patient			2
@entity94 is present , ordinary and ' normal ' when asked what he found most compelling or surprising about his findings , @entity149 says his team asked the children to talk about a time when hope became real during their disease treatment			1
" more often than not , " he recalled , " they told us about ordinary moments with family and friends -- saying grace around the dinner table , times when they were aware of the abundance they had in their lives , even though ... they build their lives around dialysis and medication			0
" we so often discount these ordinary daily moments , @entity149 says			2
but those who are more intentional about the practices that bring hope right now are better able to take care of themselves			2
the children in @entity149 's study experienced mostly psychosocial suffering , he says			0
" things like being different from their peers because they were stuck to a dialysis machine or always on medication			0
" @entity94 enabled the children to claim power -- to say : " here 's where the disease gets to influence my life and here 's where it does n't get to influence my life			1
" " i 'm normal , " @entity149 recalls a young girl telling him			0
" @entity94 helps me be more normal			1
" stress , depression may affect cancer survival what hope is -- and is n't there is a thin line between hope and denial , and that line is an unwavering commitment to truth and reality			1
@entity39 writes : " false hope does not recognize the risks and dangers that true hope does			2
false hope can lead to intemperate choices and flawed decision making			2
true hope takes into account the real threats that exist and seeks to navigate the best path around them			2
" both @entity14 and @entity149 emphasize that hope is not about positive thinking			1
@entity94 is half optimism , @entity14 explains			1
the other half is the belief in the power that you can make it so			0
there is a profound difference between hoping and wishing , he continues			0
wishing encourages passivity , whereas hope represents an active stance			2
" wishing is the fantasy that everything is going to turn out ok			0
hoping is actually showing up for the hard work			0
" fighting loneliness and disease with meditation			0

the positive physiological effects of hope are well - documented
@entity94 may buffer us from stress , anxiety and the effects of negative life events
studies show that hope promotes healthy daily behaviors
