@entity1 swimming officials have vowed to " win back the admiration of a nation " following the release of a damning report that blamed a " toxic " team environment at @entity7 which led to the country 's worst olympic pool performance in 20 years			1
it was the first time @entity1 had failed to win more than one swimming gold medal since 1992 , and the subsequent independent review revealed problems throughout the team -- from lack of leadership at the top to unacceptable behavior by the athletes			1
" standards , discipline and accountabilities for the swim team at the @entity7 were too loose , " the report said , having canvassed 94 individuals and received 30 submissions			1
" there were enough culturally toxic incidents across enough team members that breached agreements ( such as getting drunk , misuse of prescription drugs , breaching curfews , deceit , bullying ) to warrant a strong , collective leadership response that included coaches , staff and the swimmers			1
no such collective action was taken			0
" coming soon after this month 's government report claiming widespread use of drugs by @entity1 athletes , it is another serious blow to the country 's image of sporting excellence			1
swimming @entity1 said tuesday it had already begun to address some of the issues raised in the review , and had a 100 - day plan to tackle them further			1
" swimming has a proud history in this country and everyone in the sport wants to maintain and improve on the credibility and integrity which has developed over more than a century of success , " said its president @entity52			2
" before we look at winning gold medals , we want to win back the admiration of the nation , and we want to engage with our swimming community like never before at every level			1
" one of the review 's key criticisms was that team officials had been so focused on winning gold medals that the morale of the athletes suffered			1
swimmers complained of being ignored if they failed to achieve expected standards , describing it as the " @entity76 " and the " @entity77			2
" " things were quiet and weird when someone lost			0
you just sort of went to your room and got out of the way , " said one in the report			2
some respondents felt that team officials were only interested in presenting the most well - known swimmers to the media , with 24 of the 47 - strong squad being first - time olympians , while some did not turn up to support their colleagues on race days			1
" the consequence was an undertone of divisions , now and then , us and them , men and women , the best and the rest , " the report said			0
" poor behavior and disrespect within the team were not regulated or resisted strongly by other team members , and it was left unchecked or without consequence by staff and coaches on a number of occasions			0
" some individual incidents of unkindness , peer intimidation , hazing and just ' bad form ' as a team member that were escalated to personal coaches were not addressed and had no further consequence			0
" these problems were magnified by a lack of control of the team 's social media activities , the report said			1
@entity126 claimed her overuse of @entity128 cost her a gold medal in the 100 meters backstroke event in which she was favorite , while @entity132 made headlines after posting a picture of herself in a skimpy bikini just before the @entity136			1
teammates @entity137 and @entity139 were forced to remove a picture they posted online showing them with weapons in a @entity145 gun shop			0
they were banned from using social media at @entity7			2
" the media search for controversy is nothing new , but @entity152 was the first games where the influence of social media was so dramatic , " the report said			0
" some athletes engaged deeply in public debate on what they were doing , how they were doing , and even on who they actually were as individuals			0
this served to fuel emotions , good and bad , at a time where calmness , intensive focus and consistency should have prevailed			0
" social media also allowed already disconnected athletes to seek support from sources external to the team , which again diminished the reliance on a unified team			0
" the report said the lack of team spirit was partly caused by letting the swimmers prepare under individual programs with their own coaches , which caused a disconnect at all levels of the squad			1
meanwhile , the @entity185 environment was described as " mayhem " and " a candy shop of distractions			0
" " @entity189 was compounded in the absence of familiarity and sufficient opportunities to connect formally and socially			0
greater cohesion as a team would have needed to be intentional and cultivated by design , " the report said			2
the @entity197 welcomed the review 's findings			2
" @entity201 has already commenced recruitment for a new high performance director and has also taken steps to improve its relationship with key stakeholders , " said @entity197 chief executive @entity200			0
" this report is a clear message to @entity201 to continue its reforms to enable it to return to the top table of international swimming			2
