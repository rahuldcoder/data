former @entity1 mayor @entity0 has generated a firestorm by asserting , at a fundraiser for @entity6 gov. @entity5 , " i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe that the president loves @entity9			1
" of course , that 's nuts			1
@entity12 's deep and true love for our country has been a hallmark of his career			1
" in no other country on @entity18 , " he said when he was seeking the presidency , " is my story even possible			1
" @entity12 said this , it should be noted , in his masterly speech on race -- an issue that is @entity9 's most difficult and tortured			1
if you can proudly assert your love of country in a speech addressing the legacy of what he called , " @entity9 's original sin " -- slavery -- you really love this country			1
but it got me to thinking : how do you show love of country ? sure , you fly the flag in front of your house -- as @entity12 does			1
perhaps you wear a flag pin on your lapel -- as @entity12 does			1
but love of country demands more than mere flag - waving			1
let me suggest the top 10 ways all of us can show we love @entity9 : 10			1
support a strong central government			2
the @entity51 were a disaster			2
the @entity9 @entity53 was designed by men who wanted a strong central government so as to build unity , strengthen the economy and defend the homeland			2
be skeptical of too much centralized governmental power			2
inconsistent ? well , that tension is at the heart of the @entity9 experience			2
@entity63 and @entity64 wanted national strength ; @entity66 and @entity67 did not			2
to truly love @entity9 is to hold both ideas in your head at once			1
the best day i had in 2014 was the day my eighth - grader was chosen to speak to hundreds of new @entity9 at their naturalization ceremony			2
the energy , idealism and unadulterated patriotism in that room was overwhelming			0
true love of country was in the air ; and tears were in my eyes			1
connect with a soldier or a veteran			0
slapping on a bumper sticker that says " @entity87 " is fine			0
but the truth is , less than 1 % of all @entity9 serve in uniform , protecting the other 99 % of us			0
we civilians are far too separated from our military			0
i say this as one who never served , but whose father , stepfather and father - in - law all served in the @entity99 ; whose cousins have served , and who has friends on active duty today			0
as a professor at @entity105 i have taught many outstanding young officers over the past 14 years			0
i have kept in touch with many : some are still in uniform -- they give me firsthand reports of the glory and the errors of today 's military			1
others are in civilian life : they connect me to the ground - level challenges young veterans face , from the job market to navigating the @entity120			0
if you really love your country , the least you can do is be able to name someone who is sacrificing for your freedom			1
take off the rose - colored glasses			0
one reason @entity12 's race speech was so remarkable is that he did not sugarcoat the evils of racism , nor has he allowed it to poison his view of the greatness of @entity9			1
when you know the history of slavery , @entity138 terrorism and segregation , it helps you appreciate how far we have come			0
real love , mature and deep , only comes from intimate knowledge			1
ignorant , blind adoration is best left to teeny - boppers at a @entity147 concert , not true patriots			0
the goal is not " @entity150 , " but rather " @entity151 : right its wrongs			0
i have been in all 50 states			0
i had the privilege of visiting most of them with @entity159			0
if you ever get the chance to fly a million miles with president @entity159 , i highly recommend it			0
everywhere we went , we soaked up the local culture ( and both of us inhaled the local cuisine )			0
the lengthy , grueling presidential campaign gives our candidates a marrow - deep love for the wonderful diversity , the impossible breadth , and the miraculous unity of this country			1
the cliche is true : the more you see of the world , the more you love @entity9			1
maybe one reason the @entity179 had such deep love for @entity9 is that they 'd served their country overseas and seen the rest of the world at its worst			1
at the same time , when you see other countries that are doing something better than we are ; when you ride a highway in a @entity193 country that is smoother than your local interstate ; when you see a successful @entity197 pre-k program , it makes you want to work to improve on those things at home			2
listen to someone you disagree with			0
man , am i bad at this			0
i actually listen to @entity204 with some frequency			0
sometimes i want to throw something at the dashboard , but other times i gain a perspective i lack			0
besides , nothing is more @entity9 than a heartfelt political debate ; and nothing is more boring than a vigorous agreement			0
yes , the media is rife with faults , but we live in a time when technology empowers us to inform ourselves as never before			0
so , for example , before i jumped ugly over @entity221 's recent speech in @entity222 , i got on my computer and actually watched the whole thing			2
perhaps before they screamed about president @entity12 's speech at the @entity227 , my conservative friends should have actually read it			1
if you truly love your country , get out of your media comfort zone ( see # 3 above ) , check out original sources , look up some history			1
arm yourself with facts if you want to really love your country			1
question your leaders in time of war			0
the greatest , most disastrous , most tragic governmental decision made in my lifetime was the @entity239			0
too many @entity9 , broken - hearted and justly vengeful after 9/11 , meekly swallowed the @entity242 administration 's line that @entity243 was an imminent threat			2
same thing with @entity247 's internment of @entity248 - @entity9 in 1942			2
when your country is freaking out , when war fever is at its height , that is when questioning your leaders is the deepest display of patriotic love .			1

@entity255 : @entity0 's questioning of @entity12 's love of country is nuts
still , he says , it 's worth thinking about how we can all show we love the country .
