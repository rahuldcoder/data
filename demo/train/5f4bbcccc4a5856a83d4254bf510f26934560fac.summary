@entity0 , @entity1 -- explosions erupted in @entity0 for a second consecutive night wednesday into thursday morning as @entity6 jets struck a vocational secondary school , a @entity1 government official said			1
" we 're not in a position to independently confirm that allegation , " a @entity6 official said			1
the attacks got under way hours after a @entity15 spokesman acknowledged that the @entity16 is providing munitions for allies to use in the air campaign against @entity1			1
" we have provided material support , including munitions , to allies and partners engaged in operations in @entity1 , " col. @entity20 said in a statement			1
but , as president @entity28 warned @entity1 leader @entity29 on wednesday that there would be " no letup " in @entity6 airstrikes , @entity27 lashed out against the air campaign , calling the bombing of certain @entity0 targets a " flagrant deviation " from the @entity36 mandate			1
@entity28 makes the case for @entity39 leadership @entity36 @entity40 ban ki - moon said wednesday he had spoken with the @entity1 prime minister and stressed the urgent need for a cease - fire			1
the @entity36 chief said the special @entity36 envoy for @entity1 , who has been in @entity48 meeting with the @entity1 opposition , would return soon to @entity0 to try to secure an agreement			1
the war has dragged on for more than two months , with reports of horrific fighting and civilian casualties			0
the @entity55 alleged wednesday that several " non-military facilities in @entity0 that had already been bombed , were again attacked in a massive @entity6 airstrike , leading to civilian casualties			1
" it said in a written statement that " this is yet another flagrant deviation " from the @entity61			0
that resolution authorized all means necessary , short of occupying forces , to enforce a no - fly zone and protect @entity1 civilians from attacks by forces loyal to @entity29			2
a barrage of at least 18 rockets struck @entity0 tuesday , killing 19 people and wounding another 150 in the heaviest onslaught since @entity6 's aerial strikes began , a government official told @entity2			1
@entity6 said it had struck a government vehicle storage facility adjacent to @entity29 's compound			1
the @entity27 ministry said @entity6 has justified its attacks by citing the need to protect civilians but said that it was " impossible to deny the obvious fact that airstrikes are not stopping military confrontation between the warring @entity1 sides , and are only causing additional suffering of peaceful @entity1			1
" it said the airstrikes are failing to end the @entity1 conflict , which was triggered by protests in february and an ensuing crackdown by @entity29 's forces			2
@entity27 , which has been critical of the airstrikes all along , has said normalization in @entity1 can come only from an immediate halt in military activities , the ministry said			2
some have viewed the @entity1 campaign as a litmus test for relations between the alliance and @entity27			2
the 28 members of @entity6 work with @entity27 as equal partners in the @entity100 , a group that works on a wide array of issues , including security			2
@entity28 , who met wednesday in @entity104 with his @entity106 counterpart , @entity105 , increased pressure on @entity29 by repeating that , ultimately , the embattled strongman must go			0
the mission to protect @entity1 from their leader means making sure @entity29 " does n't have capacity to send in a bunch of thugs to murder innocent civilians and threaten them , " @entity28 said			2
" i do think we have made enormous progress in @entity1			2
@entity29 and his regime need to understand there will not be a letup in the pressure we are applying , " @entity28 said			0
but he and @entity105 said it will take time to reach a solution in the @entity127 country , ruled with an iron fist by @entity29 for 42 years			0
" we may have to be more patient than people would like , " @entity28 said of the apparent stalemate			0
in an effort to break the monthslong standoff , @entity132 president @entity131 plans to visit @entity0 next week for talks with @entity29 , according to a statement on the @entity132 leader 's website			0
@entity131 will meet @entity29 monday in " his capacity as a member of the @entity143 high - level panel for the resolution of the conflict in @entity1 , " the statement said			2
the panel also includes @entity147 and @entity148			0
it is the second such trip for @entity131 , who was part of an @entity143 delegation that visited the nation last month			0
that visit , which included talks on a cease - fire , did not succeed			0
the @entity1 government lashed out wednesday at @entity28 and @entity105			1
" it is illegal and illegitimate to speak about regime change under the pretext of protecting civilians , " said a government official			1
" it is up to the @entity1 people to decide when and if colonel @entity29 should go -- not the @entity16 and the @entity106 " @entity27 's official @entity165 news agency reported that @entity29 's government may ask @entity167 to mediate the conflict			1
meanwhile , in @entity0 , daily life has become more onerous			0
one woman said wednesday that she had waited more than three days on line to get a half - tank of fuel for her car			1
the woman said that , while waiting in the line on tuesday night , she saw a man a few cars ahead of her reach the fuel pump and present his number to a police officer , who rejected it as fraudulent			2
when the man protested , the police officer fatally shot him , she said			0
witnesses torched a police car in retaliation , she said			0
life outside the capital also appears precarious			0
the same woman said about three dozen @entity29 soldiers on saturday broke into her family 's farm near @entity193 -- just east of the @entity195 border -- and moved in			0
one of the soldiers told the farm caretaker they were taking over civilian properties to use as command posts and weapons storehouses because they feared being attacked by @entity6 if they were to use military facilities , said the woman , who asked not to be identified because she fears reprisal			1
a number of residents of the city of @entity206 , about two hours southwest of @entity0 , had taken up residence in caves in order to avoid @entity211 forces , said an elderly man who cited safety concerns in declining to be identified			1
nearby residents avoid seeking help from @entity206 's hospital , he said			1
" any injured person who tries to enter the hospital is detained by the brigades , " he said			0
" we try to treat our wounded and give them first aid and protect them inside the mountain so they wo n't be killed or kidnapped by @entity29 's brigades			0
" @entity2 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
