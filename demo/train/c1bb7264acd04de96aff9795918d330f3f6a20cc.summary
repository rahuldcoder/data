-- @entity4 is preparing to hand over to @entity6 officials a @entity8 teenager who was mistakenly deported after she ran away from home more than a year ago , the @entity3 country 's foreign ministry said in a statement thursday night			1
@entity12 will be turned over to diplomatic officials friday so she can be transported to the @entity6 , the statement said			1
but the foreign ministry did not say when -- or how -- that will happen			1
the @entity6 @entity16 in @entity17 is working with @entity4 authorities but can not provide additional details " due to privacy considerations , " said a @entity22 official who asked to remain anonymous per department policy			1
@entity12 somehow wound up deported to @entity4 after @entity6 authorities mistook the girl , who lacked identification , for a @entity4 national			1
family members said thursday night that they were thrilled at the news that the 15 - year - old would be returning home			2
" it 's a giant step			2
i 'm relieved , but i wo n't be completely relieved until i get her in my arms again , " the girl 's mother , @entity33 , said			1
" a weight has definitely been lifted			0
" grandmother @entity38 said @entity16 officials called with the news that her granddaughter would be turned over to @entity6 officials			1
" when i heard those words i did n't hear nothing else			2
i ca n't wait , " she said			1
but @entity12 's family was still demanding to know why immigration authorities deported the teen -- a @entity6 citizen with no knowledge of @entity49 -- and why they simply took her at her word when she gave them a fake name			1
the teen 's family had been searching for her since she ran away in the fall of 2010			1
her grandmother scoured @entity56 looking for the girl , viewing @entity12 's friends ' pages for any information			1
" there 's no words , " @entity33 told @entity0 of the ordeal			2
" it has n't been easy at all			2
" the @entity65 confirmed thursday that @entity12 is in its custody , is pregnant , and entered the country as an adult			0
the institute said @entity4 authorities learned about the case a month ago			1
after @entity12 went missing , the family managed to track her to @entity73 , where she worked at a dj club under a different name			2
they tried to get help from authorities there , to no avail			2
then , to the family 's surprise , they learned their teenage daughter was in @entity4 , partying with men and smoking marijuana			1
they later learned from a detective that @entity12 was pregnant			0
how @entity12 got to @entity4 is a mystery to the family			1
the @entity91 agency maintains she was arrested in @entity73 for theft and told them she was an adult from @entity4			1
the agency says authorities believed her story because she maintained her false identity throughout the process			2
they handed her over to an immigration judge , who ordered her removed from the country			0
" at no time during these criminal proceedings was her identity determined to be false , " the agency says			0
it says criminal database searches and biometric verification revealed no information to invalidate @entity12 's claims			0
the family 's attorney , @entity108 , says it does n't make sense			1
" they dropped the ball , " he said			0
he says the immigration agency took @entity12 's fingerprints but failed to match them to the name she gave			1
the name matched a woman wanted by @entity120 , @entity108 says , so they " shipped her on through			0
" the agency says it is taking the allegations very seriously and is " fully and immediately investigating the matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of the case			0
" for months , family members said they frantically searched for signs of the missing teen			2
@entity12 had run away once before , two weeks earlier , her mother said , and @entity12 told her the family did n't give her enough freedom			2
her good grades at school had dropped off , something @entity12 blamed on the normal problems of teenagers			0
in addition , @entity12 's grandfather , her mother 's father , had recently died			0
@entity12 said she contacted @entity8 police , the @entity145 , and @entity8 transportation authorities			0
nothing ever came of it , she said			0
grandmother @entity38 said she then started following @entity12 's best friend on @entity56			2
she eventually tracked her granddaughter to @entity73 , where she worked at a club under the name @entity152			0
@entity33 said she saw @entity12 's face on the marquee on her birthday			0
" @entity158 , " the mother said when she saw it			0
" is this really happening ? is that my child ? " a picture on @entity163 's facebook page further confirmed for the family that the girl with the different name was their daughter			1
the picture had been taken of @entity12 with her grandmother			0
though her grandmother had been cut out of the picture , her hair still showed on the edge			0
her mother said she told @entity8 authorities what she had found			0
then , @entity12 's facebook page suddenly said she was in @entity4			1
the family later learned she had been arrested in @entity73 for shoplifting , but they say they had no idea how she wound up in @entity4 after the arrest			1
the family 's concerns grew when the detective told them that @entity12 is pregnant , her mother said			2
@entity33 said she believes her daughter was coerced along the way , with someone promising her something that led her to maintain a fake story about who she is			0
@entity108 says he believes something more sinister is going on			0
" there has to be something behind this 15 - year - old girl ending up in @entity4 , besides the fact that @entity91 dropped the ball , " he said			1
" of all the nicknames ... to pick one that 's of @entity200 descent , for that to be a name that sticks and gets you deported , that does n't make sense			2
" pictures of @entity12 in @entity4 showed her sitting on men 's laps smoking marijuana , her grandmother said			1
but @entity12 , she said , seemed to be reaching out for help , listing on @entity56 the names of everyone at parties , perhaps so she could be traced			0
@entity108 says he does n't believe @entity12 was trying to fake her way out of the country by using the false name throughout the process			2
" i do n't buy that she had the wherewithal to be able to bamboozle the government , " @entity108 says			0
" you know , kids are scared when they get around authorities			0
... to think that you could bamboozle them to create a new identity , it just does n't make sense			0
" @entity4 's @entity229 said thursday that @entity12 first arrived in @entity17 after she was deported on may 23			1
the ministry said it was investigating what sort of verification its consulate in @entity234 requested before giving the girl an expedited provisional passport as part of deportation proceedings , and how @entity12 received work authorization for training at a call center as part of the government 's " @entity245 " program			1
attorneys with the program made a sworn declaration in front of a notary with " inexact information " that allowed her to receive work papers , the foreign ministry said			1
" those lawyers are no longer providing services to the @entity229 , " the statement said			0
the teen was placed in a protection program by the @entity65 on december 1 after officials learned of her situation , the foreign ministry said			1
@entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report for @entity0 .			0

new : " i flipped out . i ca n't wait , " the teen 's grandmother says
@entity4 's foreign ministry says the girl will be handed over to @entity6 officials
she is a @entity6 citizen but gave authorities a fake name
her family had been looking for her since the fall of 2010
