@entity0 -- a leader of @entity4 's ruling party held out the possibility of a vote on what to do with the @entity0 park where planned razing triggered two weeks of anti-government protests but said demonstrators must leave the park			1
" the @entity4 government will not accept @entity22 protests to be continued forever , " @entity13 , deputy chairman of prime minister @entity15 's @entity14 , said after meetings with a delegation of " popular artists " involved with the demonstrations			1
his comments were carried by the semi-official @entity24			0
@entity13 said the government could hold a referendum on the redevelopment of the park , the last green space in central @entity0 -- but he urged the demonstrators to " walk out			1
" at least one protester immediately rejected the idea of a vote			0
" we do not think that a referendum is the right way to go because we think that this park should remain as a park because it 's our right , and rights should not be asked in a referendum , " said @entity34			1
the meetings took place a day after riot police used massive amounts of tear gas , water cannons and stun guns to break up protests in @entity0 's @entity51			1
police also shot tear gas canisters into nearby @entity22 , violating a promise not to do so			0

meanwhile , thousands of lawyers marched out of their offices in several cities to rally against the arrests of attorneys in the protests			0
with no sign of negotiations on the horizon , @entity4 , a @entity68 ally with a democratically elected government , could see fighting grip more of the country			1
and harsh actions against protesters could strain @entity15 's strategic friendships with much of the @entity78 -- relationships that are particularly critical in light of the civil war ravaging @entity4 's neighbor , @entity83			1
" the real challenge for the government of @entity4 , as now the international focus is on this crisis : how do they get the people behind me to agree to go home ? " @entity1 's @entity92 reported wednesday from outside @entity22 , seat of the demonstrations			1

opinion : past and future collide in @entity4 clashes but the @entity149 protests show no sign of abating			1
what began in late may as a demonstration focused on the environment -- opposition to a plan to build a mall in @entity22 -- has evolved into a crusade against @entity15 that 's spread around the country			2
attorneys in @entity0 , @entity116 and other cities gathered in front of government buildings for rallies , @entity160 reported			2
some called on @entity0 's chief prosecutor to resign			2
government officials , however , insisted that while peaceful protests are allowed , those who use violence were being detained			0
" if these people have objections to the government 's project for @entity22 and @entity51 , they are welcome and we can listen to their ideas			2
such issues can be settled through dialogue and within the framework of the law , not resorting to violence , " president @entity177 told reporters			1
@entity15 's government has no problem with ecologists who started protests to save @entity22 from bulldozers but takes action against @entity191 extremists , who have lobbed rocks and @entity193 at police , said @entity195 , the prime minister 's chief adviser , referring to the latter as " troublemakers			2
" " anywhere in the world , they will not be considered peaceful protesters , " @entity195 told @entity1 's @entity199 on tuesday			2
he said some were associated with a group that carried out an attack on the @entity207 in @entity116 in february			0
the police reaction has been no different from that of security forces ' methods against similar groups at @entity214 protests in the @entity215 , he insisted			0
" the police obviously have the mandate to establish public order , " @entity195 said , just like they do in @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219			0
letters from @entity4 , with pride international criticism experts and human rights groups say @entity15 's government lags when it comes to human rights and freedom of expression by opponents			1
" prosecutors and courts continued to use terrorism laws to prosecute and prolong incarceration of thousands of @entity240 political activists , human rights defenders , students , journalists and trade unionists , " @entity233 wrote in a 2013 report on @entity4			1
@entity4 journalists are afraid to write anything critical of the government , and media companies are slapped with huge tax fines for covering uncomfortable topics			1
