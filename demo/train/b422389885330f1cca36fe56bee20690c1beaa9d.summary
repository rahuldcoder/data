@entity0 , @entity1 -- two @entity1 trade unions accused the country 's president of using " armed thugs " to attack protesters , and urged demonstrators to continue their nationwide strike against high fuel prices on wednesday and beyond			1
" in a @entity17 - style response to the peoples ' protests , the @entity15 administration brought into @entity20 , thugs armed with various weapons including guns , " the @entity11 and the @entity12 of @entity1 said in a joint statement late tuesday night			1
the unions were comparing president @entity15 to former @entity25 president @entity17 , who is accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters in @entity25 last year			0
" @entity28 warns the @entity29 that it will be held responsible for whatever atrocities these thugs commit , " the statement said			0
" we call on @entity1 to continue the strikes , rallies and protests ... wednesday ... and subsequent days until the @entity15 government listens to the voice of the @entity1 people			1
" government spokesman @entity38 denied the accusations and said negotiations between the labor unions and the government are under way			2
" if these claims are properly investigated , you will find out that failed and bitter politicians have not only hijacked this protest , but have diverted it from a protest against deregulation policy , " he said @entity38			0
wednesday will mark day three of the strike , which was spurred by a government decision to remove fuel subsidies -- a move that resulted in more than doubled fuel prices in the largely impoverished country			1
so far , clashes have left at least 16 people dead and 205 injured , according to a tally collected by the @entity1 @entity58 tuesday			1
the strike , continued religious violence in the north and a long - simmering separatist movement are all issues that have created growing problems for @entity15 and fueled tensions on the street			2
the southern state of @entity68 was a focus for much of the violence , according to the @entity58 , with five people killed and 83 injured			0
" revolution has come to @entity1 and the youth will spearhead it			1
until our demands are met , we are ready to protest every day and make sacrifice , " said @entity74 , a @entity1 freelance journalist			1
other violence erupted in northern @entity1 tuesday and wednesday , although it was unclear whether the incidents were related to the strike			1
in @entity83 , four people died wednesday after two gunmen on a motorcycle stopped next to a car filling up at a gas station and opened fire on the occupants in the town of @entity91 , about 600 kilometers northeast of @entity20 , said @entity92 , @entity83 state police commissioner			0
" we do n't know if it 's @entity94 or other criminal elements , " he said			0
" we are still investigating			0
" the victims ' ethnic groups had not been confirmed , he said			0
@entity94 , a shadowy militant @entity98 group that is said to favor strict @entity100 law , is frequently blamed for sectarian violence			0
also in @entity83 , eight people drinking in an open - area bar , including a police officer , were shot to death tuesday by several unidentified gunmen in @entity91 , @entity92 said			0
the gunmen opened fire without announcing their presence , he said			0
no one has claimed responsibility , and police are not sure who was behind the attack , he said			0
in a recent address , @entity15 tried to explain the need for ending the subsidies , telling @entity1 that the government would invest the money in the country 's crumbling infrastructure			1
" my fellow @entity1 , the truth is that we 're faced with two basic choices with regards to the management of the petroleum sector , " @entity15 said			2
" survive economically or continue with a subsidy regime that will continue to undermine our economy			2
" some analysts say the changes could help @entity1 in the future			2
" if they 're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform too			0
if they do that , @entity1 's growth can be instead of 7 % -8 % a year , 10 % or 11 % , " said @entity136 , a chief economist at the global investment firm @entity137			2
but assurances from the president did not allay fears from many @entity1 who do not trust the government to use the money to improve the country 's infrastructure			1
many @entity1 view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil - producing country that has little infrastructure , poor roads , high unemployment and intermittent electric power			1
" though we know that in the long run , removal of ( the ) subsidy will help the economy , for now it is a high - profile lifestyle that is unbearable for most @entity1 , and soon the poorer ones will die out , " said protester @entity157			1
@entity2 's @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , and journalist @entity167 contributed to this report .			2
