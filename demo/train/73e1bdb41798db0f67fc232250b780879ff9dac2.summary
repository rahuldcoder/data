-- sheltered from the @entity3 on a stunning bay in the western tip of metropolitan @entity6 , the city of @entity2 has at its heart one of the country 's most animated harbors			1
with its proximity to the @entity12 , this area of @entity6 is steeped in @entity14 heritage			1
as such , accordions are eschewed for bagpipes and the locals display a preference for zesty ciders over fine wines			0
the region even has its own @entity14 language , " @entity24 " , which is still spoken by nearly 200,000 people			1
@entity25 was sadly all but destroyed in the " @entity26 " during @entity27 it has since been completely rebuilt and is now a sophisticated city that hosts some of @entity31 's most theatrical sailing festivals			1
by far the most prominent of these is " @entity2 " ( " @entity33			2
" ) every four years , more than 2,000 traditional boats sail from countries as far flung as @entity36 and @entity37 to take part in the event , which is attended by nearly 700,000 avid spectators			0
this year marks its 20th anniversary and , according to the festival organizers , it will be " the biggest and most spectacular event yet			0
" from july 13 , @entity2 will be transformed into five " villages , " representing this year 's five honorary countries : @entity37 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 -- all of whom are sending a minor flotilla of historical boats			1
from village to village , visitors will be able to learn about each country 's maritime heritage and sample its music , food and handicraft			2
" there is no other festival quite like it if you like classic boats , " said @entity62 , who has sailed from @entity63 to @entity2 three times since 2000			2
" everywhere you look there are tall ships and the atmosphere is fantastic			0
there is good food and music and you get to race your ships along a beautiful coastline			1
i would n't miss it for the world , " he said			0
but it 's not just an event for maritime history buffs , this year the festival is also welcoming modern boats			2
racing enthusiasts will be able to see the finish of the @entity88 to @entity2 multi-hull transatlantic " @entity90 " , featuring some of the world 's fastest trimarans			1
" the festival has something for everyone			0
it 's really becoming a universal exhibition of all types of boats , " said @entity95 , the festival 's director of communications			0
" @entity101 " ( thursdays at the harbor ) those who ca n't make it to the summer 's main maritime festival can still experience @entity2 's unique harbor each thursday during the summer months when it is transformed into a vibrant arts space , packed with live street theater , concerts , comedy and markets			1
the music on offer is as eclectic as it is exciting , with a mixture of folk , rock , @entity6 chanson , world music , jazz , and classical acts taking the stage throughout the summer			2
@entity123 in recent years @entity6 has produced some of the world 's finest electronic bands and @entity2 has played an integral part in the scene 's development			1
every summer for nearly 20 years the city has hosted one of the most anticipated electronic music festivals in the country -- " @entity136 " -- a three - day musical feast that takes place in august each year			2
but there are also plenty of things to do and see outside the summer festival season -- especially if sailing , seafood and marine life are high on your agenda			0
@entity146 for years @entity25 has been the @entity31 capital of oceanography			0
according to the @entity149 , more than 60 % of @entity6 's maritime researchers and engineers have made the city their home , so it 's perhaps no surprise that a giant marine pavilion has emerged there			1
the venue is much more than your average city aquarium ; it is an ocean discovery park covering nearly 10,000 square meters , with 50 individual aquariums housing in excess of 1,000 animal species			0
through three pavilions dedicated to polar , tropical and temperate marine ecosystems , " @entity146 " aims to immerse visitors in an underwater universe representing flora and fauna of oceans around the world			0
there is also a fourth pavilion that houses the temporary exhibitions on marine biodiversity			0
the current exhibit , titled " @entity176 , " is dedicated to the weird and wonderful creatures that hide in the deepest part of our oceans			0
castle of @entity2 once owned by @entity182 of @entity63 , the impressive medieval fortress is the city 's most important landmark that , by sheer fortune , was spared from destruction during the heavy bombing of @entity27 the castle and its ramparts offer stunning views of the city and inside the fortress hides the city 's branch of the " @entity195 of @entity196 , " which retraces 17 centuries of @entity2 's longstanding naval history			1
@entity199 built on an enormous block of granite , the " @entity199 " is a sightseer 's favorite , with its medieval turret offering views of the long - winding @entity207 river cutting right through the city			2
the tower is also home to the @entity211 - where a series of huge dioramas take visitors on a picture journey through the city 's origins and development , showcasing life in @entity2 before it was bombed .			1
