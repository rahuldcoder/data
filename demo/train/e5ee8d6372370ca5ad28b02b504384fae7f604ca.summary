-- it 's happened to the best of us ; you 've seen an airfare on a travel site and decided to jump on it , only to watch the price plummet weeks later			1
or worse , you 've sat on it , only to see it leap beyond the reaches of your budget			0
such a grating scenario may be a thing of the past , as price predictors are becoming a common feature on booking websites			1
@entity18 , a relatively new hotel booking website that not only lists available rooms , but grades the price on an a to f scale , is the latest venture to adopt the software			1
last month , it became the first hotel booking site to add price forecasting , adding a function called " hotel time machine "			1
the tool analyzes over 10,000 different pricing models to predict whether the price will rise or fall , even providing a percent likelihood			1
given the complexity of the algorithm , it should probably come as no surprise that @entity18 is the brainchild of a former @entity41 's analyst			1
" i come from an investment finance background , and my job was all about processing large volumes of info and distilling it into something you could make a split - second , actionable decision on , " says @entity42 , @entity18 's ceo and founder			1
" we took that mentality and applied it to the website			0
" @entity42 notes that it 's only recently a site like his would be able to operate			2
" even a few years ago , it was n't really practical for a site to collect and process the volume of data that are necessary to do the types of things that we 're doing			1
we 're dealing with billions of past prices and have to literally produce a trillion - trillion forecasts , " he says			2
interactive : which airlines have wi - fi ? @entity18 is one of several sites to jump on the trend			1
in january , @entity71 added a price forecast option to its website , letting guests use it to predict whether an airfare will stay put or take a leap			1
" at @entity71 , every employee randomly gets assigned user feedback			2
enough of us saw users were asking for us to do this that we decided to allow our engineers to experiment , " explains @entity80 , @entity71 's chief product officer			2
@entity71 's approach to number - crunching is slightly different , in that the company bases its data on the billion - plus search queries performed by users			1
" that 's the benefit of our approach : the user does the crowdsourcing for us , " explains @entity80			0
the advantage of @entity71 's model is it relies on an enormous amount of data to make predictions			1
the downfall is that niche destinations ( those that are n't searched as often ) are often overlooked			0
" they 're not as accurate , because we do n't have enough data on those regions , yet , " admits @entity103			2
looking to the future price forecasters are n't entirely new			2
@entity110 brought the feature to the market back in 2005			0
the company was since bought by @entity114 and rebranded @entity115			2
the forecaster is still very much a part of @entity115 's model and , unlike at @entity71 , it extends to both hotel rooms and airfares , though strictly in the @entity123 market			1
one might imagine that price predictors would make hotels and airlines somewhat nervous			0
after all , if a deal is rated " bad " , or an airfare listed as likely to drop , are n't hotels and airlines less likely to sell at a premium price ? @entity42 says he 's found the opposite is true			0
" we expected a hostile response from hotels , just because we were shedding light on their pricing policies			0
we 've actually been approached by a lot of big name chains because they see an opportunity to sell people a nicer room			0
" read more : place your bids for business class in other words , the more expensive rooms that do n't necessarily sell as well could in fact be a better deal			0
though somewhat in its infancy , forecasting tools are going to become the norm , not just in the travel industry , but across a range or websites , according to travel industry analyst @entity158			0
" as customers start feeling comfortable using it , more sites will copy the technology , " he explains			0
" imagine the implications for the restaurant industry			0
if they know they 'll be crowded on a friday night , for instance , they can utilize this tool to incentivize people to eat dinner earlier			0

last month , @entity18 became the first hotel booking site to launch a price forecaster
the site is the brainchild of a @entity181 analyst , and crunches millions of bits of data
@entity71 and @entity115 offer a similar feature for airfares , predicting if a price will rise or fall
