-- the @entity2 must hold down its spending and make choices that will anger " powerful people " in an era of economic strain , defense secretary @entity1 said in a weekend speech in @entity9			1
increasing health care costs , a top - heavy uniformed and civilian management force , and big - ticket weapons systems are swelling the military 's budget at an " unsustainable " rate , @entity1 said			1
in response , @entity1 said , he has ordered the @entity2 's military and civilian leaders to find savings of 2 to 3 percent -- more than $ 10 billion of the @entity2 's roughly $ 550 billion base budget -- and shift spending toward war - fighting costs			1
" these savings must stem from root - and - branch changes that can be sustained and added to over time , " he told an audience saturday at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
" simply taking a few percent off the top of everything on a onetime basis will not do			2
" on his way out of office in 1961 , president @entity32 -- the former general who led allied forces in @entity34 during @entity35 -- warned of the expanding influence of what he called the " military - industrial complex			1
" nearly 50 years later , @entity1 invoked that history to warn that the cuts on the way " will displease powerful people , both inside the @entity2 and out			1
" the @entity45 defense budget has more than doubled since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity47 and @entity48 and the 2003 invasion of @entity50			2
since taking office in 2006 , @entity1 has managed to cut some of the @entity2 's major weapons systems , but efforts to kill other programs have been defeated under heavy pressure from military contractors and members of @entity58			1
" given @entity45 's difficult economic circumstances and parlous fiscal condition , military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer , harsher scrutiny , " he said			0
" the gusher has been turned off , and will stay off for a good period of time			0
gen. @entity69 , a former @entity45 military spokesman in @entity50 , told @entity0 that @entity1 is trying to preserve @entity45 combat power in the face of increasing costs			2
" he sees the political winds and recognizes he will not be able to get the budgets that he needs , " @entity69 told @entity0			0
" what he wants to do is protect the muscle			0
by cutting away at some of the fat , he can keep the money necessary to keep the constantly increasing budget to maintain a strong and ready force			0
" @entity1 acknowledged that many of his predecessors have tried and failed to do the same thing			0
but he said the @entity45 force structure should be reviewed in " the wider , real - world context " and was probably out of scale to existing threats			0
" for example , should we really be up in arms over a temporary projected shortfall of about 100 @entity93 and @entity95 strike fighters relative to the number of carrier wings , when @entity45 's military possesses more than 3,200 tactical combat aircraft of all kinds ? " gates asked			0
" does the number of warships we have and are building really put @entity45 at risk when the @entity45 battle fleet is larger than the next 13 navies combined , 11 of which belong to allies and partners ? is it a dire threat that by 2020 the @entity45 will have only 20 times more advanced stealth fighters than @entity113 ? " @entity1 said defense spending was roughly twice the share of the @entity45 economy in @entity32 's day -- " but today , we face a very different set of @entity45 economic and fiscal realities			1
" " as a matter of principle and political reality , the @entity2 can not go to @entity45 's elected representatives and ask for increases each year unless we have done everything possible to make every dollar count , " he said .			2

@entity1 says he 's ordered officials to find savings of 2 to 3 percent in @entity2 budget
defense secretary wants " root - and - branch " changes , not just onetime cuts
the cuts on the way " will displease powerful people , " @entity1 says at @entity32 *libary*
goal is to shift @entity2 's $ 550 billion annual spending toward war - fighting costs
