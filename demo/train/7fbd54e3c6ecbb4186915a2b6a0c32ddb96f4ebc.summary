-- after an eight - year hiatus , @entity1 is back ! not really , but for some fans of @entity5 it 's the closest they can get at this point			1
the actress made her highly anticipated return to tv on tuesday night in the @entity11 's " @entity10			1
" playing ex-stripper @entity13 and her wealthy twin sister @entity14 , @entity5 's characters are a far cry from her days as the now - iconic vampire slayer on " @entity1			1
" but fans of the late supernatural series agree , they 'd follow the actress just about anywhere : and that includes her new film noir - type soap			0
though the @entity11 's programming tends to skew a bit younger , " @entity10 , " which was originally created with @entity27 in mind , maintains a more adult quality			1
potentially perfect for fans of @entity32 's cult hit , many of whom have likely matured with @entity5 , now 34			1
" this is a good way for fans who loved ' @entity1 ' to sort of continue on with [ @entity5 ] , " @entity36 's tv editor @entity35 said			1
" because they 're older , i think it can appeal			0
we do n't need vampires or werewolves or the forbidden love between her and @entity46			0
" the anticipation helps , too			0
@entity5 went off the air on a high note after " @entity1 " -- and stayed off			1
despite a tv movie , a couple of voiceovers on popular animated series and roles in two film franchises -- " @entity60 " and " @entity61 " -- the actress chose to lay low while beginning a family with husband @entity64 the pair welcomed their daughter @entity68 in september 2009			2
" the hiatus actually worked wonders for her , " @entity35 added			0
" a lot of ' @entity1 ' fans were teens when ' @entity1 ' was first on			0
they grew up with her -- through ' @entity77 , ' ' @entity60			2
' and when she went off the grid to do her family thing , people started to miss her as opposed to tossing her aside as a has - been			0
" like tv bloggers and industry insiders predicted , " @entity10 " reeled in a solid audience for the @entity11			1
however , its 2.7 million viewers do n't quite compare to the 3 to 5 million viewers who tuned into @entity90 - turned - @entity89 to watch " @entity1 " each week in the late ' 90s and early 2000s			1
but tv consumption is a different beast from when @entity5 first graced the small screen			1
anywhere in the 2 million viewers range is standard for programs on the @entity11 , which spawned from the aforementioned networks			1
" ' @entity1 ' fans are incredibly loyal , " @entity98 , the editor of @entity99 , said before the show 's premiere , adding , " they 're 100 % going to watch ' @entity10			1
' ... i 'm sure the @entity11 will be happy with [ tuesday 's ] numbers			1
" and @entity5 's involvement is n't just appealing for viewers			1
her " @entity10 " co-stars are equally as thrilled to have her aboard			2
" when we knew @entity5 was attached , that was the biggest draw to the project -- as much as the brilliant script that we both read , " @entity108 , who plays @entity14 's husband , said at @entity110			1
" the package was just too attractive to turn down			0
" and as if " @entity1 " fans were n't enough , throw in fans of " lost 's " @entity118 , who plays @entity120 agent @entity119 on the show			2
" it 's smart casting , " @entity35 said			2
" they 've picked people who are really going to bring [ viewers ] along with them			2
" but , as @entity98 says , " it 's easy to get someone to tune in , but people have to enjoy the show			0
whether or not the ' buffy ' fans stick around , we 'll see			0
" @entity133 , who runs @entity134 , said he 's sure it will take some time before he can fully separate @entity5 from @entity1 in her new roles , but he 's thrilled to welcome her back to tv			1
of course , he adds , there is a chance it wo n't live up to " @entity1			0
" and @entity5 knows it			2
" you ca n't top ' @entity1 , ' " @entity5 , who is also co-executive producer of her new series , told @entity143 prior to " @entity10 's " debut			1
" there 's no reason to try			0
it lives in that world , so you have to do something that 's interesting for both the audience and for me as an actor			2
and that 's not necessarily the easiest thing to find after a show like that			0
" get more geeky news and musings at the @entity164 blog perhaps unsurprisingly , " @entity10 " was met with mixed reviews			2
the @entity166 is among the many outlets to compare @entity5 's characters to @entity1 , noting , " [ @entity5 's performance ] hardly lends confidence that she 's capable of being the cornerstone of such a show			1
" the consensus of most reviews being , " give it a few episodes			0
" a boating scene shared by both of @entity5 's characters attracted a good amount of negative criticism			1
stationary clouds and calm water for miles backs the scene , which @entity183 describes as " the @entity184			0
" " they might have gotten stuck in the @entity188 trade wind and been unable to navigate the difficult waters of the @entity190 , " the article states			0
but , for " @entity1 " fan @entity191 , @entity5 can do no wrong			2
" i noticed [ the green screen ] a bit , but honestly , it was fine to me , " she said			0
" i mean , it did n't look that bad			0
... it did n't affect the performance			0
" it 's just nice to spend time with @entity5 again each week , @entity191 added			1
" it feels like family -- the same kind of comfort			0
