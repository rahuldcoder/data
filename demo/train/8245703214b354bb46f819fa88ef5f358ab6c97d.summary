-- like most teens , i had a lot of questions about sex growing up , but i really did n't want to ask my parents any of them			1
i did n't want to ask anyone any of them			2
i tried to piece things together for myself from what i 'd read in books , seen in movies , seen in plays			0
it was n't that my parents would n't have frankly answered my questions			1
they had always let me know they were quite ready to discuss the topic , anytime i wanted to			0
even though it was a little difficult for me , i eventually became more comfortable			1
in fact , when i lost my virginity , i felt i should honor my dad 's forthrightness by telling him			2
( my mom and i had already discussed it before the fact			0
) he said , " ok			0
and are you using birth control ? " i told him i was			0
" great , " he said			0
" i do n't really need to know much more			0
thank you so much for telling me			0
" he was proud , i think , that i had shared the news with him but could only handle so much at that moment			0
and though my dad clearly had a line where he got squeamish , i 'm always grateful that both of my parents were so clear with me that sex was a normal , wonderful part of life and nothing to feel ashamed about			1
as a parent , i think about that often now			2
our daughter is in high school , and our older son is in middle school			0
like my parents , we try to do everything possible to make sure we are communicating with them in a clear , frank way so that they actually hear what we have to say			1
they have access to information about sex in ways we never did			1
we are competing with many different sources : @entity61 , texting , the @entity62 , and television all influence how they think and act			0
that 's why @entity68 in october -- an annual awareness - raising effort that emphasizes the importance of conversations about sex and relationships between parents and their teens -- is extremely important			1
it 's a great opportunity for parents and young people to start ( or even better , continue ) a meaningful conversation about sex and relationships			1
a new study from @entity82 , @entity84 magazine and the @entity85 and @entity86 at @entity87 shows that parents are significantly more comfortable talking to their teens than teens are talking to their parents -- just the way i was ! opinion : oops , i left my sexual orientation at home but even though it may be hard to get started , it 's so worthwhile to talk with kids , answer their questions about sex , and help them make smart decisions about their relationships and behavior			1
and the more you talk , the easier it gets			2
in my household , we started talking with our kids when they were young , when their curiosity about their bodies and about differences between boys and girls created natural opportunities for starting a dialogue			1
we always emphasized that their bodies were private and their own			0
and while every family has its own opinions on this , from our earliest conversations about sex i felt it was important to emphasize to both my daughter and my son that birth control is a must , not a maybe			2
age - appropriate school programs also help reinforce the conversations we are having at home and can help increase teens ' comfort level when talking with their parents			1
my daughter 's sex education class in middle school was really terrific			1
every student was required to anonymously write down a question on a piece of paper and put it in a hat at every meeting			0
there were questions like , " can you get pregnant if you have sex when you have your period ? " that kind of anonymity -- when posing a question a teen really wants to ask , but is maybe too embarrassed to ask a teacher or a parent directly -- is so important for a young person			1
and that class sparked endless conversations and made our daughter feel more comfortable talking about these issues with us at home			2
it is never too early or too late to start having these conversations			0
october is as good as time as any			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

@entity165 says when she was young , she dreaded talking about sex with her parents
she eventually did ( her parents were open with her ) , and values that , now that she 's a parent
october is @entity68 ; parents , make sure you talk to your kids about sex , she says
@entity176 : kids get information online ; parents and schools must correct *misinformation*
