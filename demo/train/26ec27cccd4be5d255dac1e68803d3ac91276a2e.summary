@entity0 , @entity1 -- could the leader of a democracy reverse his nation 's slide toward the ever more permissive use of firearms and mandate stringent new gun control laws in less than a fortnight ? well , yes			1
one of @entity12 's loyal allies did just that -- and with massive voter support			2
in a popular tourist spot at @entity17 , @entity18 , in april 1996 , a lone gunman killed 20 innocents with his first 29 bullets , all in the space of 90 seconds			0
this " pathetic social misfit , " to quote the judge in the case , was empowered to achieve his final toll of 35 people dead and 18 seriously wounded by firing semi-automatic rifles originally advertised by the gun trade as " assault weapons			2
" now we discover that a similar military - style rifle enabled the @entity33 killer to add his name to the global list of gun horrors			2
in his initial press briefing on the @entity33 mass shooting , @entity38 press secretary @entity37 said " today is not the day " to talk about gun control			1
in 1996 , @entity1 reacted with the opposite mass - majority voice , insisting : " now is the time			1
" polls : your thoughts on gun control @entity1 's newly - elected prime minister at the time was @entity50			1
the country 's most conservative leader in decades , openly proud of his pal status with @entity54 , prime minister @entity50 led the then @entity12 president to refer to his nation as @entity12 's " sheriff " in @entity58			0
just like president @entity59 , @entity50 was seen to weep and to offer the nation 's prayers in the wake of another gun massacre			1
but only 12 days after the shootings , in @entity50 's first major act of leadership and by far the most popular in his first year as prime minister , his government announced nationwide gun law reform			1
read more : @entity59 on assault weapons ban attitudes to firearms and the regulations governing them had changed almost overnight			0
after a decade of gun massacres which saw 100 people shot dead and 38 wounded , @entity1 had overwhelmingly had enough of anyone with a grudge gaining easy , mostly legal access to weapons designed expressly to kill a lot of people in a very short time			1
new legislation agreed to by all states and territories specifically addressed mass shootings : rapid - fire rifles and shotguns were banned , gun owner licensing was tightened and remaining firearms were registered to uniform national standards			1
in two nationwide , federally funded gun buybacks , plus large - scale voluntary surrenders and state gun amnesties both before and after @entity17 , @entity1 collected and destroyed more than a million firearms , perhaps one - third of the national stock			1
no other nation had attempted anything on this scale			0
it was n't without cost to @entity50			0
self - interest groups among his conservative base raised hell , and at one rural meeting in a country town , he became the first @entity1 prime minister to be photographed wearing a bullet - proof jacket			1
but with statements like : " we do not want the @entity12 disease imported into @entity1 ... guns have become a blight on @entity12 society , " @entity50 knew he was speaking for most @entity1			2
polling at the time measured public approval of his government 's new gun laws at 90 to 95 per cent			2
in the years after the @entity122 , the risk of dying by gunshot in @entity1 fell by more than 50 % -- and stayed there			1
in the 16 years since the announcement of legislation specifically designed to reduce gun massacres , @entity1 has seen no mass shootings			1
gun deaths which attract smaller headlines are 80 times more common , yet the national rate of gun homicide remains 30 times lower than that of the @entity12			2
analysis : why gun controls are off the agenda in @entity12 to claim cause and effect would be to stretch all this too far			0
mass shootings are such rare events as to defy prediction , gun death rates were already falling , and @entity50 's gun laws no more prevent every shooting than our traffic laws eliminate the road toll			2
the best we can say is that the results are encouraging , and suggest a way forward			0
beliefs and fears aside , death and injury by gunshot could be as amenable to public health intervention as road toll , drunken driving , tobacco - related disease and the spread of hiv / aids			0
the obstructions to gun control are nothing new to public health			1
an industry and its self - interest groups focused on denial , the propagation of fear , and quasi-religious objections -- we 've seen it all before			0
@entity59 , at the center of a maelstrom of clashing convictions few foreigners can comprehend , deserves our sympathy			0
but the future is there to see			0
with gun violence , as with hiv / aids , waste - of - time notions like evil , sin , blame and retribution could in time be sluiced away to allow proven public health procedures			0
given the opportunity and the effort , gun injury prevention might save lives as effectively as restricting access to explosives , and mandating child - safe lids on poison bottles			0
opinion : put reason back in @entity12 's gun debate the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

in @entity1 , one massacre turned the tide in favor of gun control
just 12 days after the shootings nationwide gun law reform announced
@entity209 : risk of dying by gunshot in @entity1 fell by more than 50 % -- and stayed there
