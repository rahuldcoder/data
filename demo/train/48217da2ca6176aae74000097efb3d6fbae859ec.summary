-- it seemed like a good idea at the time : skip the " @entity4 : the @entity5 " -- the only major wide release this weekend and more or less review - proof -- and check out the new releases down at the local dvd store instead			2
@entity11 and @entity12 star in " @entity13 , " though she does n't hang around long			1
i was up for this assignment			2
we all know how close " @entity18 " came to bypassing theatres			2
the film was initially bankrolled by @entity20 , and when that boutique shingle was rolled into parent @entity23 , some executive decided that the year 's best picture should not pass @entity26 -- skip the $ 200 -- and head straight to the rental chains			1
( @entity23 , like @entity0 , is a division of @entity28			2
) if it could happen to " @entity18 , " what other gems might be out there ? i scan the shelves			2
" " @entity34 " " @entity35			2
" i 'm a movie critic -- been there , done that			2
a harder look produces a handful of possibilities			2
i zero in on three unfamiliar titles			0
" @entity13 " boasts the participation of former child star @entity12 while the quote from @entity45 @entity44 promises " a pleasant buzz			1
" " ghost writer " does n't come with any critical endorsement , just a groaner for a tagline ( " deadline has a new meaning " ) , cover art that says horror - suspense , and an oddball cast : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
finally , there 's " lullaby " ( " he took her son ... now she 'll take him " ) starring @entity70 best actress nominee @entity69			1
with its unfashionable sepia artwork and mom - on - the - warpath scenario , this looks like a 1970s grindhouse flick			0
not best picture material , i 'm thinking , but then again , when did you last see a bad @entity69 performance ? never , i 'll bet			1
it 's a crapshoot , so to improve the odds i take all three			1
first up is " @entity13			1
" it turns out this did get a theatrical release			0
it opened on nine screens in september and went down from there , so unless you actually live in @entity13 , which is in far northern @entity90 , you probably missed it			1
and if the movie is to be believed , even if you do live there you probably still missed it , because you were otherwise engaged in farming illegal substances , gazing at the shoreline , and / or hanging out with your quirky neighbors			0
it 's an alternative lifestyle that sneaks up on the very straight , anxious young med student @entity99 ( @entity11 )			1
he 's inducted by " @entity101 " ( @entity12 ) , but scarcely seems to notice when she disappears in the second reel , leaving him in the care of @entity105 ( @entity106 and @entity107 ) , not to mention her last boyfriend , @entity108 ( @entity108 )			1
in keeping with the hazy vibe of the thing , nothing much happens -- slowly			0
@entity99 misses the bus out of town , more than once			0
eventually you realize days , even weeks have gone by and @entity101 still has n't returned			0
you wonder if @entity99 and @entity108 might hook up in her absence ? but that would harsh the mood			0
instead things just drift by			0
what does the world need with another doctor anyhow -- and where 's @entity123 when you need him ? so i 'm underwhelmed by " @entity13 , " but it 's a masterpiece beside " ghost writer			1
" shown in festivals as " @entity128 " -- possibly the worst title i 've ever heard -- " ghost writer " is the story of an effete gay music teacher , @entity132 ( @entity57 ) , harboring an unrequited crush on @entity134 ( @entity58 ) , a rampantly heterosexual drifter and aspiring novelist he has invited into his home			1
@entity132 gets madder and madder with @entity134 until the day he knocks him out , dresses him in a bra and panties , ties him up with fairy lights and starts swinging			0
it sounds horrific but it 's pitched as an arch black comedy , and so incongruously staged by @entity57 ( who also directs ) that it 's neither funny nor scary , except in how scarily unfunny it is			1
mind you , the scene in which horny 69 - year - old @entity62 makes out with @entity58 taps a camp hysteria that puts the rest of this flaccid flick to shame			0
now my hopes are riding on " lullaby			1
" i check out the @entity153 and wish i had n't : " lullaby " has a user rating of 2.8 out of 10			1
@entity155 is @entity156 , a waitress who is getting hit up for money by a foreign gangster who says he has her ( grown ) son , a junkie			0
so @entity156 does what any self - respecting mom would do			0
she sells her car , borrows from her friends , and buys a plane ticket to @entity165 to deliver the thug his ransom in person			0
only the price has gone up			0
he gives her two hours to stump up another $ 2,000			0
directed by @entity171 and produced in @entity165 , " lullaby " makes no sense in any way except one : @entity155 's performance does			1
the " homicide " and " @entity177 " actress soldiers through this thing with dogged commitment , as if she does n't know where her next meal is coming from			0
if that means taking a gig shooting in the sleaziest crime neighborhood in @entity187 , well , it 's still better to play a waitress than be one			2
i know exactly how she feels			0
after all , i could be watching the @entity4 right now			0
" @entity13 " is rated r and runs 97 minutes			1
" ghost writer " is unrated and runs 93 minutes			1
" lullaby " is unrated and runs 97 minutes			2
for a review of the @entity4 ' film , go to @entity195 .			0

some films go straight to @entity198 for a reason
" @entity13 " drifts by , with little reason to watch
" ghost writer " is neither scary nor funny , despite being pitched as black comedy
@entity69 does *yeoman* 's work in *pointless* " lullaby "
