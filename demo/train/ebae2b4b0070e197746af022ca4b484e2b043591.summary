@entity0 -- seven people went on trial for manslaughter tuesday in @entity5 , accused of failing to predict an earthquake that killed more than 300 people in @entity8 in april 2009			1
the seven -- six scientists from the @entity10 and a member of the @entity12 -- were members of a governmental panel that prosecutors accuse of giving a " rough , generic and ineffective assessment of the seismic risk			1
" the seven , members of a so - called " major risks " panel , published " inaccurate , incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers of seismic activity undermining the protection of the population , " prosecutors said			1
the first hearing tuesday morning in @entity8 's tribunal was devoted to technical matters and claims by injured parties			1
the city of @entity8 has requested 50 million euros ( $ 68 million ) in compensation			1
only one defendant was in court , the vice president of the panel , @entity33			2
" i thought it was important to be here , not only because this is my turf but also to underline the professionalism ... of the other public officers , " @entity33 told reporters			2
the trial has attracted the attention of the scientific world			2
the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) wrote to @entity5 's president @entity45 in june last year to express " concern " over the indictment of its @entity5 colleagues			0
" the charges against these scientists are both unfair and naive , " the letter said			1
the basis of the indictments appears to be that the scientists failed to alert the population of @entity8 of an impending earthquake			1
however , the letter continues , " there is no way they could have done that credibly			0
" lawyer @entity62 is defending @entity63 , who was president of the @entity10 at the time of the quake			0
@entity62 denies that it 's a trial against science , saying : " professor @entity63 simply said that the earthquake is unpredictable , that it could or it could not happen			2
" the @entity12 had organized a meeting of the major risks panel in @entity8 on march 31 , 2009 , amid concern among the city 's residents over ongoing seismic activity			1
after that meeting some members of the commission made reassuring statements to the press			0
in particular @entity33 said in an interview with a local tv station that the scientific community was " reassuring " him , and that the numerous tremors were in some ways a good thing , as they released seismic energy			2
the interview concluded with a joke			0
" meanwhile , let 's go and have a glass of wine , " the journalist said			0
" absolutely ! " @entity33 replied			0
six days later , the magnitude - 6.3 quake hit the city and surrounding areas , causing wide destruction and loss of life			1
@entity98 is among the citizens of @entity8 to feel let down by the panel			1
" there are big responsibilities that this trial has to establish			0
no one alerted us , there were no evacuation plans that could have saved lives , " he told @entity1			0
" it 's not a matter of drinking a glass of wine , it 's a matter of respecting rules			0
" the next trial session was scheduled for october 1 .			0
