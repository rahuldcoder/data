editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1
" visit his web site for more information			0
@entity2 says he does n't buy all the hype associated with @entity12			1
( @entity13 ) -- with retailers hurting and the @entity8 president trying to encourage @entity8 to spend money to restore consumer confidence , what i 'm about to say may seem like treason			2
but here goes : please boycott @entity12 and all that is associated with this horrendous " holiday			1
" for several years i have ripped into @entity12			1
not because i 'm against love and relationships , but mainly because the holiday is such a farce			2
first of all , @entity12 is not built around a religious event like @entity29 or @entity30 ; nor does it have any special meaning to the nation such as @entity33 or @entity34			1
it is nothing more than a commercial holiday created by rabid retailers who needed a major shopping day between @entity29 and @entity30 in order to give people a reason to spend money			0
now folks , i love my wife			0
she is truly an awesome woman who is smart , talented , fine , and , did i say fine ? but do i really need a special day to show my affection for her ? i 've long maintained that if i sent my flowers at other times during the year , why do i have to fall victim to peer pressure and send her some roses that have quadrupled in price leading up to february 14 ? why should i be inundated with mailings , e-mails and commercials to show her that i love her by buying jewelry or clothing ? if we went shopping in june or september or last month , can i get some kind of waiver or " get out of @entity12 " card ? as for this silly flower thing , it 's even got to the point that any flowers ca n't do			1
some years ago i planned on sending a woman some flowers that were n't roses , and the ( female ) co-workers were aghast			1
they felt that nothing mattered except roses			0
first of all , i did n't have a lot of dough and felt a nice bouquet was sufficient , but they were appalled			0
so i told them to go to hell and i 'll do what i want			0
i guess for them , the thought really does n't matter			0
then there are the women on the job who measure the love of their men based on those flowers			2
you know how some folks are			0
if there are flowers on the desk of 10 other women , and one woman does n't have anything , folks get to talking and whispering as if something is wrong in her relationship			2
i 've learned that even if you get the biggest - ever rose bouquet -- the relationship might be crumbling and you just refuse to admit it			0
and @entity12 really is n't even a two - way street			1
men are utterly irrelevant except to serve as pawns in this commercial game , emptying their wallets in order to satisfy their lovers or those around them			0
oh yea , retailers know the con game			0
most of these guys are hapless saps who have ignored their wives or girlfriends all year , so they buy the flowers and candy , and set a reservation at one of the city 's most expensive restaurants , all to say , " honey , i love you			1
" ladies , and men , stop it ! it 's time to say enough is enough with @entity12			1
what do i want ? how about men and women loving , caring and sharing the other 364 days a year ? february 14 is n't the only time to send flowers to your woman ( ladies , we would n't mind getting a surprise delivery as well ! )			1
how about dropping her a flower arrangement on may 14 ? and on that card you need to write , " just because ... " instead of men and women spicing up their sex life on february 14 , make the effort to satisfy your mate the rest of the year			2
if last @entity12 was the last time you took your significant other out to a really nice restaurant , you deserve to be in trouble			1
are you planning to treat your man or woman to a wonderful day at the spa this saturday ? well , i 'm sure he or she would thoroughly enjoy the same in june or july			0
it 's time that we all take stock of our relationships and learn that we are to be loving and fulfilled 365 days a year , and not reduce our affection to flowers , candy , jewelry , clothes and a meal on one day a year			1
the people who plan their lives around @entity175 's are like those who spend more time planning their wedding day rather than planning their marriage			0
the day is nice and wonderful , but what makes it last is what you do on the " non-special " days			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity12 is good for retailers but it 's a bad idea overall
he says *overpriced* flowers and dinner at a fancy restaurant do n't cut it
@entity2 : show your love for your mate all 365 days a year
