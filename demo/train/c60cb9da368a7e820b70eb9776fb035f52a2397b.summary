house speaker @entity0 on thursday rebuked @entity2 colleague @entity1 for controversial comments on undocumented immigrants , calling the remarks " deeply offensive and wrong , " and acknowledged the fallout makes it harder to reach a deal on immigration reform			1
@entity1 , when discussing a proposal to give citizenship to the children of undocumented workers in an interview last week with @entity15 , suggested many of them were drug smugglers			1
" for everyone who 's a valedictorian , there 's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds -- and they 've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they 're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert , " @entity1 asserted			2
@entity29 immediately denounced the comments and @entity0 released a written statement with similarly sharp criticism two days ago			1
but at a time when there is mounting pressure on @entity36 to address an overhaul of immigration policy , @entity0 deliberately repeated the message before tv cameras at his weekly press conference			1
" there is no place in this debate for hateful or ignorant comments from elected officials , " @entity0 said			1
he added that what @entity1 said " does not reflect the values of the @entity49 people or the @entity50			2
we all need to do our work in a constructive , open and respectful way			0
" @entity0 and many other @entity36 @entity50 are now backing a proposal that would allow children brought into the @entity49 illegally by their parents to obtain citizenship			1
but @entity1 is n't backing off			2
he doubled down on thursday , maintaining his remarks were based on facts			0
" if people were offended , were they offended by the number or my choice of the fruit ? and , if so , what 's offensive about the number or that ? i ca n't imagine why it 's racist and if i offended anybody it was drug smugglers and it does n't trouble me to offend drug smugglers			0
if i intended to offend anybody that would be the group , " @entity1 said			2
after speaking on the @entity36 floor , @entity1 did n't seem fazed by @entity0 's comments			1
" we know that the speaker responds to criticism in the press			0
" @entity1 said , adding that he would have preferred @entity0 to approach him personally before speaking to the media			1
many @entity36 quickly recognized the potential political damage @entity85 remarks could have on the @entity2 as the party works to regain ground with @entity89 voters after losing badly among the group in the 2012 election			0
@entity93 @entity92 rep @entity92 , who represents a district with a significant @entity89 population , concurred with @entity0 in a tweet			0
" @ @entity97 is right			0
rep. @entity1 's comments are hurtful & disrespectful			1
@entity101 member 's prejudicial statements wo n't derail progress ! " the @entity103 , a @entity2 leaning group , released a poll on wednesday that found a majority of @entity50 in @entity1 's district backed a comprehensive approach to immigration reform			1
without naming @entity1 , @entity109 , the group 's spokesman , sent a statement stressing the public support for legislation			2
" hopefully with knowledge like this , the most ardent opponents of reform will pause to consider what they can support and how they can play a constructive role in fixing this broken immigration system			0
" @entity1 brushed off the poll , and suggested the questions were crafted to get a specific response			0
he admitted his office has been inundated with calls since the public coverage of his comments , and said to date the reaction has been slightly more negative , with 55 opposed and 45 supporting his position .			0
