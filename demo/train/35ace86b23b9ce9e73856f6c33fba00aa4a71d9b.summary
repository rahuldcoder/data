-- newsflash : ' 80s icon @entity2 is still cool			1
" @entity4 " star just did an " @entity8 " interview on social news site / intense internet community @entity8 , and by all accounts , it was a smashing success			1
over the course of a few hours , @entity2 shared anecdotes from her @entity13 - directed heyday , proved she knows a thing or two about the site 's unique memes , and poked fun at @entity18 , whose own @entity8 interview went disastrously wrong this past february			1
@entity2 does n't have a project to promote ; " @entity24 " is in the middle of its fourth season , and though she 's working on a jazz album , it wo n't be released until next spring			1
maybe that 's why she was so loose and funny on @entity8			1
here , for example , is how she responded when a user asked about her famous " @entity30 " lipstick trick : " regarding lipstick , it 's all movie magic			2
there is a story behind that : @entity13 wrote it but never actually thought about me having to do it			2
he kept putting it off until the end of filming that long scene			2
i kept bringing it up , like , ' hey			0
we got ta figure this out			0
are we going to have robotic breasts ? ' finally we decided it was better to see less and let everyone assume that i was particularly skilled			0
" robotic breasts ! when someone asked for details about a proposed " @entity51 " sequel : " i do n't remember much about it , but the script eventually became ' @entity54			0
' " the best part of the interview , though , came when accioc asked , " how did you manage to get hotter with age ? " though i 've already spoiled @entity2 's answer here , it 's worth repeating anyway : " i drink the blood of @entity64			1
" ( also worth noting is user cheryldad33â € ²s response to @entity2 's response : " i had assumed that blood would be stale and lifeless			2
" ) this , celebrities , is how you can convince the @entity72 's cynical denizens that you 're more than an empty vessel : do your research , do n't be afraid to stray from talking points , and above all else , show off your personality			0
( unless you 're not funny in real life , i guess			0
) @entity80 's full interview -- there 's plenty more stuff about her ' 80s movies in there , as well as a truly great " @entity87 " reference -- then tell us : what 's your favorite part of this @entity8 ? oh , and @entity91 -- @entity2 is also on @entity92 now			1
just do n't try to get her attention by tweeting , " what 's happening , hot stuff ? " see the full article at @entity0			0
