-- dr. @entity1 , @entity0 's mental health expert , addresses two questions from readers reacting to a piece on anxiety from @entity7 , @entity9 managing editor , on her lifelong struggle with the condition			1
look for @entity12 to address other questions in the future			1
q : can using marijuana or having a drink or two be helpful for people with anxiety ? what should they watch out for ? dr. @entity1 : if one goes on any search engine looking for study results related to marijuana or alcohol and depression or anxiety , one will immediately see that most of the evidence tells a cautionary tale			1
many studies suggest that regular use of either marijuana or alcohol is associated with an increased risk for a variety of mental health problems , anxiety and depression among them			1
increasing data suggests that regular marijuana use in adolescence may also be a risk factor for developing very serious psychotic disorders , especially schizophrenia			1
in addition to promoting other disorders , alcohol is especially liable to abuse and dependence and has ruined innumerable people 's lives for millennia			1
far fewer studies have examined whether using these compounds in moderation might improve depression or anxiety			1
but as @entity56 noted almost 2,000 years ago , alcohol is both a blessing and a curse to mankind			1
indeed , now we know that the regular modest use of alcohol actually promotes a number of health factors			1
similarly , it is increasingly clear that many of the chemicals within marijuana hold great promise for the treatment of physical pain			1
the endocannabinoid system in the brain -- which is a primary target for marijuana -- has profound effects on how people think and feel			1
my son is mentally ill , so listen up for example , increasing evidence suggests that the " runners high " many people get after strenuous exercise is produced primarily by activation of the brain 's ' internal endocannabinoid system			1
other chemicals in marijuana impact other brain pathways , like serotonin , that are known to play a role in depression and anxiety			1
people have been taking a drink or two in the evening since time immemorial			2
and many people will attest that this practice helps them shed the cares of the day			2
recently , i 've met with several very experienced psychiatrists who have been recommending small amounts of marijuana use for for very depressed patients who have n't responded to antidepressants			2
in some patients , they are reporting remarkable improvements			2
but the problem at this point is that while many studies have shown an association between alcohol / marijuana and mental illness , i do n't know of any really rigorous studies looking at the therapeutic potential of either for depression and anxiety			1
answering the question of what people who use these substances should watch out for is easier			2
they should watch out for the possibility that they become more anxious or depressed after drinking or using marijuana			2
and they should keep a close eye on their use , especially use of alcohol , which can be highly addictive			2
whatever potential benefit alcohol and marijuana may offer is 100 % lost once they are abused			2
q : what are the best anxiety treatments who do n't want ( or are afraid ) to take medicines ? is there anything that might ease their concerns ? is there a point where medication becomes essential ? dr. @entity1 : by far the best studied non-medicine treatment for depression or anxiety is psychotherapy			1
literally hundreds of studies have shown that on average psychotherapy works as well for these conditions as do medications			2
of the various psychotherapies , the best studied is cognitive behavioral therapy , or @entity154			2
but studies are being done all the time , and other forms of therapy are also emerging as highly effective			0
over and above the type of therapy employed , a key factor of therapeutic success is the " fit " between the client / patient and therapist			0
in practical terms , this means that people should feel comfortable with their therapists			0
if one feels ignored , looked down upon , dismissed or attacked , it is very unlikely the therapy will be successful			0
very often when therapy works people start feeling better within a few weeks , so this is also something to look for			0
no other non-medical treatment for depression or anxiety has anywhere near the amount of supporting evidence that psychotherapy does			1
having said this , significant evidence now points to the usefulness of exercise for improving mental health			1
especially when it comes to depression , exercise has been repeatedly shown to be of value			0
both strength training and aerobic exercise have benefits and combining them is the best of all			0
however , to get the full antidepressant effect of exercise requires real commitment			0
to work optimally , exercise must be engaged in for at least 30 minutes a day five days a week			0
and the intensity level should be such that one has some difficulty carrying on a conversation while doing it			0
anxiety , you 're not the boss of me however , other health benefits accrue from far less strenuous exercise and in general many people feel better with even moderate exercise			1
several supplements have shown promise in depression			0
both same and l - methylfolate have shown promise as additions to people not fully responding to antidepressants			0
most of us in the field think they also work by themselves , although more data are needed			0
the data for @entity225 is plus / minus			0
some evidence suggests that omega - 3 fatty acids and n - acetyl - cysteine may also hold promise for the treatment of depression if someone has a pattern of becoming depressed every winter , bright light therapy with a light box delivering at least 10,000 lux of light has been shown to be very effective			1
about 10 % of the population suffers from some degree of low mood and energy in winter			0
this phenomenon is more common in cold , dark , gray places than in warm , sunny @entity245 ones			0
the power of a light box to lift mood and give energy can really be exceptional			0
this is an option that is sadly too often overlookied			0
many people swear by a variety of non-traditional approaches			0
the bottom line is that if someone is helped by these modalities and not harmed , the goal has been achieved			0
