@entity0 , @entity1 -- the tech industry is currently all about mobile			1
smartphones are seeing huge growth , and there are a huge number of players trying to get a slice of the money consumers are spending			2
@entity12 in @entity0 is the one big opportunity for companies to show off the models they are hoping will capture the imagination of customers			0
like last year , the show belongs to @entity19			0
almost all of the hot smart phones announced here run @entity23 , @entity19 's phone operating system that is making a decent fist of competing with the other main player in this space , @entity27 's @entity26			1
read more : @entity19 's @entity28 warns of ' digital caste system ' the trouble is , if your company makes mobile phones , it can be hard to stand out from the crowd			1
manufacturers are trying several ways to stand out at @entity12 this year , from a phone that becomes a tablet when you slide it into a separate dock , to a tablet you can draw on using a specially designed pen via a phone that has a projector inside it			1
to make the sameness worse , @entity23 is designed so that anyone can take the software , put it on their phone and that it will work with the same experience			1
to try to avoid their products becoming commoditized , manufacturers have been customizing the software to make their mobiles feel different to the competition			2
this has been a mostly bad strategy as it has meant that , whenever @entity19 has issued an update to the @entity23 software , it has taken ages for the new version to make it through to ordinary consumers , and customers have been complaining in droves			2
companies seem to have learned their lesson though , keeping the tweaks to their new models to a minimum			0
the other big trend is more mobile power			1
quad - core processors are appearing inside all the manufacturers ' high - end models , which gives them more speed than a typical computer from a few years ago			1
whether consumers actually need all this power is an open question , but it opens the door to more exciting , realistic - looking games to appear on mobiles in the future			1
trade shows are great levelers			0
if your product is good enough , you can make a big impact even if you are a small or unknown company			0
@entity95 is one such company that could be giving the likes of @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 some problems in the future , another is @entity102			0
both have announced some high - end models that can easily compete with the very best in the industry , and they should be cheap too			1
expect to hear more from these players in the future			0
but the star of the show is undoubtedly @entity111 , which has stolen the headlines with the announcement of a mobile with a 41 - megapixel camera -- that 's significantly more megapixels than in most cameras people own			1
read more : 41 megapixel camera phone the idea is that it gives much better quality shots when you zoom in compared to a normal camera phone , which matters because there is no room for a big zoom lens on a typical mobile			2
the only downside is that it is running @entity130 , the platform @entity111 is in the process of dumping , rather than its operating system of choice , @entity135			1
but as a great show story , it ca n't be beaten			0
the elephant in the room is @entity27			0
the company does n't exhibit at @entity12 , preferring to create buzz around its own events			0
but it still feels like it 's everywhere			0
as yet , only @entity98 has had much success in competing with @entity27 at the high end , but they are all watching what @entity27 does with interest and keeping their fingers crossed for a monster hit			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152			2

manufacturers *struggling* to stand out in the mobile - *obsessed* tech industry , says @entity152
@entity152 says *android* operating system contributes to " sameness "
phone makers *including* more power , but he questions whether consumers need it
