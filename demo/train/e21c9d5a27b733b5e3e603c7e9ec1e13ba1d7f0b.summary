-- a @entity3 high school that fired all its teachers in february has reached a tentative agreement with the school 's teachers union to rehire them , the union announced sunday			1
the school board of the @entity9 , outside @entity10 , had voted to fire 93 staff members from its high school -- including teachers , administrators and other personnel -- over low student performance			1
the deal between the union and the school district allows teachers to return to work for the 2010 - 2011 school year without having to reapply for their jobs , though the union said sunday that " teachers will need to recommit to their jobs and interview with the new principal			2
" the agreement , which must still be ratified by teachers , includes measures to improve student achievement , including a longer school day , targeted professional development for teachers and more after - school tutoring , the statement from the @entity29 said			1
the school district and union have been working with a mediator since march			0
" there has always been agreement on these points : that we all want what is best for our students , and that significant changes are needed at @entity51 , " teachers union president @entity41 said in the statement			2
" working together , we and the district have arrived at a solid , forward - looking agreement that provides support for our students and the tools our teachers need to help them succeed			0
" a teacher ratification vote on the deal is scheduled for monday afternoon			0
in a move that drew national attention , the @entity61 school board had voted 5 - 2 to approve a plan by the school district 's superintendent to fire its high school staff , including the principal , three assistant principals and 77 teachers			1
the vote came after the high school , which draws students from an impoverished enclave of @entity3 , graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year			1
of @entity61 ' 800 students , 65 percent are @entity77 and for most of them , @entity78 is a second language			0
half the students are failing every subject , with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math , officials said earlier this year			0
president @entity86 publicly endorsed the school board 's vote			2
" our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right , " he said in march			0
but the move outraged the school 's teachers , who argued that they 'd accepted most terms of a plan by the school district 's superintendent to improve student performance			1
the plan approved by the school board in february allowed teachers to re-apply for their jobs but stipulated that no more than 50 percent would get rehired			1
the firings would have gone into effect at the end of this school year			0
" from the start , my principal concern was not who would be working at the high school , but whether the new school leadership team would have the flexibility it needed to improve student achievement , " @entity61 superintendent @entity109 said in the statement provided by the teacher 's union			1
" today 's agreement provides this flexibility			0
" @entity3 officials applauded the tentative deal			2
" i 'm glad both sides have ... [ reached ] this agreement , " @entity3 education commissioner @entity124 said , according to the union 's statement			2
" now it 's time to move forward and work together to make @entity130 one of the best in @entity3			0
