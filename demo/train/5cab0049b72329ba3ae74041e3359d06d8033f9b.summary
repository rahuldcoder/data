-- six - time champion @entity1 has failed to make the title match at @entity3 for the first time since 2002 after being dumped out in the quarterfinals on wednesday			1
@entity1 's title defense came crashing to a halt in the face of an inspired performance from @entity10 in @entity11			1
the @entity13 star was knocked out at the last - eight stage of a tennis grand slam event for second successive time following his similar exit at the @entity17 a month ago			2
@entity19 12th seed @entity10 triumphed 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 4 in front of a stunned crowd on @entity22 to set up a semifinal clash with no. 3 @entity24			1
@entity1 , the top seed ahead of world no. 1 @entity26 -- who reached the semis by beating sixth seed @entity29 -- later revealed that he had been hampered by injuries			1
" i am struggling with a little bit of a back and a leg issue			2
that just does n't quite allow me to play the way i would like to play			0
so it 's frustrating , to say the least , " the 28 - year - old star told reporters , as quoted by @entity39			2
@entity42 bard : @entity3 serves up poetry ace " the leg injury came in the finals of @entity46			2
that never really went away , and the back 's been feeling really badly stiff for the last five or six days			0
when you 're hurting , it 's just a combination of many things			0
you just do n't feel as comfortable			0
" under the circumstances , i think i played a decent match			0
but i 've been feeling bad for the last two , three matches now			0
it 's just not good and healthy to play under these kind of conditions			0
so if there 's anything good about this , it 's that i 'm going to get some rest , that 's for sure			0
" @entity1 was sluggish throughout the match , and though @entity10 wobbled in the final games , he held his nerve to record the biggest victory of his career to date			1
@entity10 broke @entity1 's serve in the seventh game of the opening set to take it 6 - 4 , but the world number two looked to have regained control as he powered to a 6 - 3 triumph in the second			1
@entity3 's humble beginnings but @entity1 's game fell apart in the third set as @entity10 took it 6 - 1 in just 27 minutes			1
another vital break in the fourth set took @entity10 to the brink of victory , and he took his second match point to seal an impressive win			2
it was only @entity1 's sixth defeat on @entity22 , but the former champion was still afforded a huge ovation as he waved to the crowd upon leaving the arena			1
@entity10 reached his second grand slam semifinal , having also reached the last four in @entity91 earlier this month before losing to eventual runner - up @entity29			1
" it 's amazing to play in this stadium against such a great player and to leave as the winner is an amazing feeling , " he told the @entity93			0
" so far it was the toughest game in my career to serve to close out the match			0
" earlier , @entity24 brushed aside the challenge of @entity103 to clinch a place in the last four			1
@entity105 on his marathon match at @entity3 the @entity107 had little trouble dispatching @entity103 , from @entity109 , 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 2 in just one hour and 51 minutes on court no. 1			1
@entity24 's unseeded opponent , who beat @entity113 @entity112 in the previous round , did n't force a single break point in the entire match			1
@entity24 told the @entity93 : " nothing is easy these days especially at this stage of the tournament but the way i played i deserved to win			2
i hit all the shots , played the rallies and was solid from all parts of the court and i am very happy			0
" i sincerely hope i can continue with this level of my game but you never know how you are going to wake up in two days but the way i am playing match after match is very encouraging			0
" you have nothing to lose in the semifinals and definitely this time i am physically fitter than in my last one three years ago			2
" @entity26 , who beat @entity1 in the final in 2008 but missed out on last year 's event due to knee problems , was again too strong for @entity29 as he followed up his @entity17 triumph with another win over the @entity139			1
the @entity140 came from behind to win 3 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 1			1
he will now face @entity141 after the @entity143 fourth seed beat @entity145 no. 10 @entity146 6 - 7 7 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 2			1
@entity141 dropped the opening set on a tie - break but took the second by the same method			2
after that , @entity146 capitulated and @entity141 wrapped up the third and fourth sets with the minimum of fuss			0
speaking of his clash with @entity156 told the @entity93 : " it will be a great match , it 's always fun			0
i think we 've played four times in @entity160 and won two each			0
i 'm looking forward to it			0

@entity10 knocks top seed @entity1 out of @entity3 in the quarterfinals
@entity19 12th seed beats six - time champion @entity1 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 4
he next faces @entity24 in semis after @entity107 no. 3 beat @entity103
world no. 1 @entity26 through to last four after beating sixth seed @entity29
