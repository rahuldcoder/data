-- it was the longest game in @entity3 history , and saturday 's unconvincing victory must have lasted an eternity for @entity7 manager @entity6 and the disgruntled fans of the big - spending @entity10 club			1
last season the @entity11 was a hero as he guided @entity7 to a first league title in 44 years , but with a second successive early @entity16 exit imminent following wednesday 's defeat at @entity18 , his future does not seem so certain			2
criticized for tactics that his players apparently could not understand , @entity6 made more changes for the match at home to @entity24 -- but a lackluster first half ended to the sound of booing from the stands			2
@entity28 , last season 's enfant terrible after going awol following his feud with @entity6 , came to the manager 's rescue after being pulled back to a deeper striking role			2
the @entity33 netted the only goal of the game , his first since september 1 , with an opportunist effort from distance in the 61st minute that sparked the first of two lengthy delays as goalkeeper @entity40 collapsed with a groin injury that has ruled the @entity42 out for up to six weeks			1
@entity7 then had an anxious wait as defender @entity44 -- who publicly questioned @entity6 after the @entity18 game -- was stretchered off with a knee injury , needing an oxygen mask			2
with almost 13 minutes of time added on , the game beat the previous record set when @entity51 drew with @entity52 in 2011			1
the win moved @entity7 up to second place , a point behind @entity56 -- who take on third - placed @entity58 on sunday			1
" our performance in the first half was so - so because i think we were so tired , but in the second half we played better , we had a lot of chances to score , " @entity6 told reporters			0
" in this moment , when you are in a difficult moment , after a defeat in the @entity16 , it is important we start to win quickly			0
" we played three days ago and @entity24 played very well			0
they were fresh , so it was important to take these three points			0
" we now have one week when we can recover and i hope we can recover a couple of ( injured ) players for the next game and we can work			0
" @entity51 also rebounded from midweek @entity77 defeat as midfielder @entity78 scored a late winner against bottom club @entity80 , who had @entity82 sent off			1
the match marked the return of young @entity86 international midfielder @entity85 after a 17 - month injury absence , and the 20 - year - old lasted more than an hour as he helped the @entity90 side bounce back from losses to @entity92 and @entity93 last weekend			1
@entity78 's 84th - minute goal , on the rebound after his initial header hit the bar , came soon after @entity99 was red - carded for kicking out at @entity100			0
" i am very happy with the result because we lost two big games in our head , and the confidence was a bit jaded , " manager @entity104 said after seeing his team move up to fourth place " we were serious , we moved the ball quite well and we needed to be patient			1
it was important not to make a mistake , and wait for our chance and take it			0
" @entity114 moved up to sixth after conceding a last - minute equalizer in the 3 - 3 draw at @entity117 , who remained in the bottom three			0
former @entity58 striker @entity120 put the @entity90 team 3 - 2 up in the 88th minute , but @entity122 snatched his winless team 's fourth draw from eight matches			0
@entity126 moved away from the relegation zone with a 2 - 1 win at home to midtable @entity130 , while @entity131 and @entity132 played out a stalemate and @entity93 drew 1 - 1 with fellow strugglers @entity134 , who had @entity136 sent off with 40 minutes to play .			1

@entity28 scores only goal as @entity7 struggle to 1 - 0 win over @entity24
match is longest in @entity3 history after almost 13 extra minutes added on
lengthy delays caused as both teams lose a player *due* to injury
@entity51 also bounce back from @entity77 defeat , moving up to fourth place with win
