-- the @entity2 @entity1 voted late monday to criminalize any public denial of what new legislation calls the @entity7 's genocide of @entity8 , triggering fresh condemnation from modern @entity10			1
relations between @entity2 and @entity10 have already deteriorated since the @entity12 -- the lower house of the @entity2 parliament -- voted to approve the bill in december			1
the @entity10 government called monday 's vote " an example of irresponsibility " and vowed to " express our reaction against it in every platform			2
" it is already illegal in @entity2 to deny the @entity24 , a crime punishable by a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ( $ 58,500 )			2
the same punishment would be used under the @entity29 legislation			2
monday night 's 127 - 86 vote sends the legislation to @entity2 president @entity32 , who has indicated he would sign it			1
@entity29 's government hailed the vote , saying @entity2 " reaffirmed its pivotal role as a genuine defender of universal human values			1
" but @entity10 , one of @entity2 's @entity41 allies , called it " an entirely unfortunate step for @entity2 politics			1
" " politicization of the understanding of justice and history through other people 's past and damaging freedom of expression in a tactless manner are first and foremost a loss for @entity2 , " it in a statement on the vote			1
" it is obvious that the interpretation of historical events can not be determined by the attitude of @entity2 politicians who see in themselves the right to judge other nations on the basis of one - sided views and declare a judgment on a serious allegation of crime such as genocide , thereby ignoring the principles of international law			2
" the statement added , " @entity10 is determined to take every step required against this unjust action , which disregards basic human values and public conscience			2
" the @entity10 - @entity29 controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist			1
@entity29 groups and many scholars argue that @entity10 committed genocide starting in 1915 , when more than a million ethnic @entity8 were massacred in the waning days of the @entity7			1
@entity10 officially denies that a genocide took place , saying hundreds of thousands of @entity29 @entity87 and @entity10 @entity88 died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of @entity92 i. before the vote , sen. @entity93 , one of the bill 's supporters , argued that since @entity2 already recognizes the @entity7 - era killings as genocide , the same standard that applies to @entity24 denial should apply to the @entity29 case			1
" when we contest the @entity104 genocide , we can be punished , " @entity93 said			0
" and up until now , when we contest the @entity29 genocide , there is no punishment			2
so we ca n't have a legal punishment for one and not for the other			0
everyone is equal in front of the law			0
" but sen. @entity113 , who opposed the legislation , said freedom of expression was at stake			0
" it calls into question historical and scientific research			0
tomorrow will there be a question of a @entity126 © e genocide ? " he asked , referring to a revolt against the @entity2 revolutionary government in 1793			0
" will we put the @entity128 and the @entity129 in the stocks for the massacre of @entity132 ? we must reject this text and consign it to history books			0
" after december 's vote in the @entity12 , @entity10 prime minister @entity135 accused @entity2 of committing its own " genocide " during its war against @entity139 independence in the 1950s and 1960s			1
@entity135 announced that @entity10 was reviewing its ties with @entity2			1
@entity142 recalled its ambassador to @entity144 for consultations , canceled bilateral visits and would n't cooperate with @entity2 in joint projects within the @entity148			0
the @entity149 shot back at @entity135 's comments , saying @entity2 " assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history			0
" and @entity32 has said that his country does n't need an ok from another nation to develop its policies			0
in addition to being @entity41 allies , @entity10 and @entity2 have trade ties valued at $ 13.5 billion , according to @entity10 statistics			1
the genocide debate is also a source of tension between @entity10 and the @entity129 , another @entity41 ally			0
the @entity170 , for example , annually beats back efforts in @entity172 to pass a resolution that would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of @entity8 as genocide .			0

new : @entity10 calls the vote " first and foremost a loss for @entity2 "
@entity29 *praises* the vote and thanks the @entity2
the @entity2 @entity1 approved the controversial legislation 127 - 86
@entity10 expressed anger over the bill when it passed the @entity12 in december
