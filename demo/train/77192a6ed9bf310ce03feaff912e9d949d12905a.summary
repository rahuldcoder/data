-- a @entity2 primate sanctuary on thursday maintained its chimpanzee named @entity4 , who died last week , was more than 80 years old and acted in the @entity7 movies during the 1930s , amid doubts about his age			1
@entity4 died saturday after suffering kidney failure the week before , the sanctuary said on its website			1
several chimpanzees appeared in various @entity7 movies , many of which were popular in the 1930s and 1940s			1
@entity20 , outreach director at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity2 , said @entity4 appeared in the @entity7 moves from 1932 through 1934 , meaning he was older than 80			1
" i 've been around this chimp for 51 years , so we know he 's 51 , and he was an adult when i met him , " @entity20 said			0
but several primatologists said thursday they were skeptical that @entity4 was in his 80s when he died			1
chimps commonly live into their 40s , and in captivity they can live up to age 60 , according to @entity35 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to the welfare of chimpanzees			1
" it 's hard to doubt folks who are caring for the chimp if they say they 've had the chimpanzee that long consistently -- i 'm not in any position to question it , " said @entity42 , a primatologist at the @entity43			0
" what 's a bit surprising about the story is that the chimp is reported to be as old as it is			0
" he said it would be " quite remarkable " to find a chimpanzee anywhere who could live to 80			2
@entity20 said her grandparents acquired @entity4 for the sanctuary in about 1959 or 1960			1
" they used to pick up their own animals , " she said			0
she told @entity0 affiliate @entity58 that @entity4 came from the estate of @entity60 , who played @entity7 in movies through 1948 with other chimpanzees			1
@entity60 -- the first speaking @entity7 , according to the @entity64 website -- died in 1984			2
@entity65 , a primatologist at the @entity66 in @entity67 and a leading authority on chimpanzees , administers the @entity70 , a record of chimpanzees who live in @entity75 zoos			0
he said " only a small handful " of chimps in records dating to 1901 have even approached 70			0
" i think in that light , it 's a pretty unlikely claim " that @entity4 was older than 80 , @entity65 told @entity0			1
the likelihood of a chimp living to 80 - plus is " slim to none , " said @entity84 , a primatologist who has worked with @entity85			1
said @entity86 , dierctor of the @entity87 in central @entity88 , " it makes me scratch my head a little bit			0
" @entity20 said the life expectancy of chimpanzees can be higher in sanctuaries because of the quality of care they receive			0
at @entity21 , they are fed five times a day and receive attentive care			0
" they can go so long , and they can mask illnesses so greatly , " @entity20 said			0
another chimpanzee in a @entity2 sanctuary named @entity106 is said to be 74 years old and believed to be the oldest living chimp now , said @entity108 , a spokeswoman for the @entity109 in @entity110			2
@entity65 said even @entity106 's age is " pushing it a little bit , " and @entity42 said that age exceeds what scientists have been able to document			0
another chimpanzee named @entity4 lives on a primate sanctuary in @entity119 named @entity4 ( @entity120 and @entity121 ) , both named after the chimp character in the @entity7 movies			1
the @entity119 sanctuary 's creator , @entity125 , said on its website that he was saddened to hear of @entity4 's passing in @entity2			1
he said he and others at the sanctuary " send our deepest sympathies to our colleagues at @entity21			0
" @entity125 said he was told his @entity4 was one of the original chimps in the @entity7 movies during the 1930s and 1940s			1
but when he began working with @entity138 writer @entity137 on @entity4 's biography several years ago , research revealed " that our @entity4 is unlikely to be as old as we 'd thought , although he is clearly old , " @entity125 wrote			2
" it is also difficult to determine which movies , if any , our @entity4 may have been in , " @entity125 wrote			2
@entity20 said several primates at her @entity2 sanctuary have been in the entertainment industry			2
" to me , they 're all celebrities , " she said			0
on the @entity4 matter , she said , " we know there 's going to be naysayers			2
we do n't run in that mode			0
