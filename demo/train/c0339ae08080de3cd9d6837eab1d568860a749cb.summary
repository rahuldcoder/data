-- want to get an @entity1 on friday ? you 'll probably need to wait in line			1
or pay someone to do it for you			0
hipster - looking shoppers already have plopped down in folding chairs outside @entity10 's flagship store on @entity11 in @entity12			0
and in @entity13 , a man working through a micro-tasking company ( more on what that means in a second ) has been diligently waiting in line , for a price , since monday			1
" you 're going to wait here until friday ? @entity27 watch over you , " a stranger told that person , who was using a service called @entity24 , according to his @entity26 feed			1
massive demand awaits friday 's @entity1 sale @entity24 nabbed the first - in - line spot to try to promote its online service that allows people to pay someone else to do a menial task for them			1
in this case , according to @entity35 , you can find people online who for about $ 40 to $ 150 will stand in line to purchase the @entity1 5 on your behalf			1
that sort of idea is n't all that new , and line - standers also are offering their services on craigslist			2
" if you are looking to buy the @entity1 when it is released , but not looking to stand in the line			1
i 'll do it for you ! " wrote one person in @entity49			0
" i 'll get in line at 6 a.m. for 40 bucks			2
camp overnight for 70 , " wrote another stander , this one from the @entity53			2
other people are posting craigslist ads asking others to stand in line for them			1
one such ad , in @entity49 , says the patron will offer the stander " a reasonable amount " ... " and on top of that , i 'll even buy you breakfast			2
" @entity66 : lining up for an @entity1 ? for those who do n't want to spend even more than the hefty price tag for the @entity1 , but do want to pick up a phone on friday , perhaps the line is the way to go			1
unless you hopped online within the first hour or so last friday , pre-ordered iphones are n't expected to arrive for weeks			2
but plan to get up early on friday morning			0
while opening - day @entity1 lines vary by location -- what passes as early enough at a @entity77 in @entity78 may not work for an @entity79 in @entity12 -- analysts generally say advance consumer demand for the @entity1 is outpacing previous models			1
early reviews of the phone have been positive			0
@entity10 recently announced it had received 2 million pre-orders for the new phone , which is taller , faster , lighter and slimmer than the previous model , the @entity87			0
that 's about double what the company experienced for the previous @entity1 , @entity10 said			2
that could foreshadow long lines			0
or it could mean more consumers are skipping the line - waiting game and , instead , have chosen to order the phone online			0
iphone 5 pre-order shipping dates pushed back the line waits are part exercise in extreme consumerism , part homage to @entity10			1
last year some of the line - standers made pilgrimages to @entity10 stores in part out of a sense of tribute to @entity10 co-founder @entity108 , who died a week before the phone went on sale			1
fans set up mini-memorials in his honor at some @entity10 stores			0
to get a sense of what the most dedicated @entity10 fans are willing to go through , check out this chart from the @entity120 , which shows the longest @entity10 gadget waits			0
@entity66 : camping out at @entity123 apple store if you 're just in the market for purchasing the new @entity1 , not the in - line circus , there are several other stores that plan to carry the @entity1 5 on friday			1
