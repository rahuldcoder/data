-- call @entity1 a nerd all you like , but never call him a geek			1
to the co-creator of " @entity8 , " the term " nerd " is a compliment			1
" i feel like with ' nerd culture , ' [ it sounds like ] the nerds have triumphed , " he said			2
' @entity14 ' has a negative connotation			0
i 'd rather be called a nerd			0
i love being called a nerd			0
" back in 2003 , this particular nerd could n't believe it was all over for " @entity8			1
" " when we were canceled by @entity21 , we thought that was it , " @entity1 recalled			1
" we really did n't have any expectations at the time			0
it was really emotional because we spent four years locked in a dark room working on the show			0
i went on with my life and wrote a couple of pilots			0
" as the years went by , the network @entity31 ( a @entity33 property , along with @entity0 ) started airing reruns of " @entity8 " along with " @entity35			1
" " @entity35 's " ratings and dvd sales convinced @entity21 to give it a second chance , and the rest is history			0
" @entity8 's " ratings were similarly high , and once " @entity35 " started putting feature - length episodes on @entity43 , a light bulb went off in @entity1 's head			1
" ' @entity35 ' blazed the trail with direct - to - dvd movies and got back on the air , " he said			1
" we called @entity21 and told them every six months that , hey , ' @entity8 ' is even more fitting for direct - to - dvd			1
" finally , in 2007 , fans had their " @entity8 " back , in not one , but four direct - to - dvd movies			1
as a result of those sales , @entity55 is starting a new season of the show on thursday night			0
the first order of business : wrapping up what happened at the end of the last movie , when @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and the rest of the crew were sucked into a wormhole			0
" our first episode is ' rebirth , ' which is metaphorical but a surprisingly literal term -- our crew members are going to suffer some serious physical harm , " @entity1 explained			2
" not for the squeamish , necessarily , but we will see the rebirth process as science has it in the year 3000			0
" the most exciting new thing about this season of " @entity8 , " according to @entity1 , is that it 's , well , new			1
" i want to reassure our fans that this will be the real classic ' @entity8 ' back to its original form			2
they supported us , and we want to repay them			0
" for fans who are probably wondering what happened between @entity65 and @entity66 , last seen kissing before that climactic trip , @entity1 said their questions will be answered , all in good time : " we 're going to be dealing with the surprising sci - fi consequences of that relationship			1
" former vice president @entity92 will also provide his voice , once again , just in time for the holidays			1
" the holiday special 's going to focus on the future versions of @entity97 , @entity98 and ' @entity99 , ' which @entity67 made up to get off of work			0
@entity92 will make his record - breaking fourth guest appearance , " @entity1 said			1
" we will have the classic pairing of @entity92 and @entity104 , making his third appearance , playing kwanzaa - bot			2
" " @entity8 " also has a big milestone to celebrate , thanks to that @entity55 pickup : " we will have our 100th episode with @entity111 and @entity112			1
@entity66 leads the mutant people who live under the sewers in an uprising against the surface people			0
" @entity117 love @entity8 so what kind of brain power does it take to write a show with so many jokes revolving around nerdy topics ? " my master 's degree [ in physics and theoretical computer science ] puts me in the middle of the pack -- we have had three science phds in our writers room , so no one is impressed with my master 's degree , " @entity1 joked			1
" we do sneak in a high - level math or physics equation , and we know few people get them , but they are hidden in the background , and we 'll reward a few viewers and hopefully make them lifelong ' @entity8 ' fans			2
" one example of such nerdy humor will actually come to the forefront in the near future			0
" our tenth episode of the new season is written by dr. @entity147 , and it involves the characters switching minds , and it becomes very complicated due to the nature of this to work our way back to the original body , and requires solving a mathematical problem , " @entity1 explained			2
" @entity147 actually proved a theorem critical to resolving the episode			0
we 're going to present a ' @entity8 ' theorem			0
" cracking jokes and breaking new scientific ground at the same time ? fans of " @entity8 , " nerdy or otherwise , would n't want it any other way .			2

seven years after being canceled by @entity21 , " @entity8 " is back -- on @entity55
co-creator @entity1 : " [ @entity165 ] supported us and we want to repay them "
*cliffhanger* from the end of the direct - to - @entity43 movies will be resolved
