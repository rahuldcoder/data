shortly after exhorting the @entity7 to continue its " never - ending journey " to live up to the ideals of its founders , on his way off the platform at the @entity14 of the @entity15 , president @entity6 stopped to drink in the scene before him			1
" i want to take a look one more time , " he told those surrounding him			0
" i 'm not going to see this again			0
" and so , with his oath of office taken -- again -- and the speech delivered , the president stood aside for 24 seconds on the chilly monday afternoon , letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal , public second inauguration file past			1
it was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam - packed day			1
@entity6 stole another such moment with his wife , at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend monday night			1

first lady @entity48 wore a floor - length , custom , ruby - colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by @entity53 , the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress			1
the celebrations came a day after @entity6 was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low - key ceremony at the @entity59			1
the flag - waving crowd that watched monday 's event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the @entity67 for blocks			1
the waving flags , the red - white - and - blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation , with the peaceful extension of power based on last november 's election that returned @entity6 to the @entity59			1
the best @entity79 tweets the @entity81 marches , the ceremonial guns and the voices of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 having faded away , @entity6 headed into the @entity15 for a luncheon with members of @entity89			1
then he led the traditional parade up @entity91 , stopping near the @entity59 to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks			0
" you 've got to come out for this , " said @entity98 , a @entity99 resident			0
" everyone 's excited -- good vibes right now			0
" also publicly sworn in for a second term was vice president @entity105 , who , like @entity6 , also took his official oath sunday			1
justice @entity107 performed the honors for @entity105 at his home at the @entity110 in @entity99 , where the vice president 's extended family and a few @entity114 officials gathered to watch the ceremony			2
@entity105 and his wife , @entity117 , also took some time to walk part of the parade route , with a grinning @entity105 periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades			0
once both couples and their families were seated at the @entity59 reviewing stand , one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from @entity132 's @entity131 , @entity6 's alma mater			1
what followed included dozens of military and school bands , @entity137 dance troupes whirling in traditional dress , war veterans , @entity141 re-enactors , kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and @entity145 's governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats			0
10 opinions : explaining @entity6 's speech @entity6 , the first @entity151 - @entity7 president and the 17th to win a second term , used a pair of @entity155 in monday 's ceremony -- one from @entity157 , the other from @entity158 his roughly 2,000 - word inaugural address hearkened back to both			1
" i did everything possible today to keep from crying , " said @entity7 rep. @entity161 , @entity162 , a onetime lieutenant of @entity158			1
he called the sight of @entity6 using @entity165 " very moving , unreal -- almost unbelievable			1
" monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of @entity158 , who was assassinated in 1968			0
the loudest cheer of @entity6 's address came when he said the nation 's journey remained incomplete " until our wives , our mothers , and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts , " and " until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law			2
" @entity6 embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address @entity6 begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years			2
@entity7 " have the power to set this country 's course , " he said , urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting " the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast , but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals			0
" on the @entity67 , @entity202 and his wife , @entity203 , took in the scene after driving from @entity205 to witness history			0
the former @entity99 residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration			0
surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing , @entity202 said " it 's nice to see all the different kinds of people			0
" even some of those who did n't support @entity6 's november re-election turned out to watch			2
@entity220 , 27 , and his 21 - year - old brother @entity221 said they do n't agree with the president on taxation , debt and other fiscal issues but did n't want to miss this bit of history			2

@entity36 , @entity234 participate in national day of service a new @entity238 / @entity237 poll released monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago , when nearly 2 million people crowded the @entity67 despite frigid weather for @entity6 's historic first inauguration			1
in january 2009 , nearly seven in 10 @entity7 questioned in a @entity238 survey said they were thrilled or happy that @entity6 was about to take office			2
now , according to the new , that number is down 18 points , to 50 %			0
back then , six in 10 saw @entity6 's inauguration as a celebration by all @entity7 of democracy in action , with just 39 % saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate			2

" the thrill is gone , along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together , " said @entity238 polling director @entity259			0
@entity265 : @entity6 2.0 -- tougher , wiser ? reality of second - term presidencies the smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second - term presidencies , when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act			1
for @entity6 , that difference is even sharper			2
his historic ascendancy to the @entity59 in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades			0
however , a litany of challenges , including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional @entity287 over budgets and spending , only hardened the opposing positions in @entity99			2
@entity6 's signature achievements , including major reforms of the health care industry and @entity294 , became symbols of political division , with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery			2
@entity6 's unfinished business and battles ahead for his second term , @entity6 has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy , proposals that are bound to spark battles with his @entity287 rivals , and oversee the implementation of @entity309			1
and the shootings at a @entity312 elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda			0
@entity238 polling released sunday showed a majority of @entity7 -- 54 % -- believe @entity6 will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term , while 43 % said he 'd be poor or below average			1
and while overall , seven in 10 @entity7 hope the president 's policies succeed , only four in 10 @entity287 feel that way , with 52 % hoping that @entity6 will fail			1
@entity6 's second - term priorities but @entity59 majority leader @entity324 , @entity325 , told @entity238 , " today is the day for all of us in this country to come together			1
" " i think the president did a fine job , certainly , laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country , " @entity324 said			2
" there are areas of disagreement , but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on , and that is this country is one of opportunity			0
and sort of the way we get there to help everybody , there are some differences			0
hopefully , we can bridge those differences			0
" four other priorities for the next four years			0
