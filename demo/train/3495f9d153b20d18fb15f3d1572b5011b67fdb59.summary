" at the time of the hijacking , @entity3 was a @entity37 with dreams of overthrowing the @entity5 government			1
@entity1 , he thought , might provide him with military training to carry out his own revolution			2
to get to the communist nation , he smuggled a .25 - caliber pistol onto a @entity45 flight scheduled to fly from @entity46 , @entity47 , to @entity48			0
after the flight took off , @entity3 brandished the pistol and told the pilot to fly the plane and 56 people aboard to @entity0			2

we are going to hell or @entity1			2
' " @entity5 doctors see @entity5 jailed in @entity1 but @entity3 ' dream of being embraced by @entity1 as a fellow revolutionary did not pan out			1
@entity1 authorities told him that he would n't receive military training and instead would be put on trial			2
they offered to send him back to the @entity5 with the hijacked plane , but he chose to stay in @entity1 to show he was n't " a play revolutionary			1
" after brief court proceedings , his new hosts gave him a lengthy prison sentence			0
" i thought i had won the case , and they gave me 15 years , " @entity3 said			2
" i did n't even know what 15 was in @entity72			0
and they said ' quince			0
' i said , what is ' quince ' ? and my translator said 15 years			0
and i said , ' 15 years for who ? ' and they said , ' 15 years for you			0
' " @entity1 and @entity5 talk mail cooperation @entity3 served over 13 years in some of @entity1 's toughest prisons and said he received regular visits from @entity5 diplomats			1
after his release in 1997 , @entity3 had two daughters and said being a father changed his politics			0
" i am no longer a revolutionary , " he said , " just a father			0
" @entity3 still faces a federal indictment in @entity48 for the hijacking			0
in 2009 , he wrote president @entity92 requesting a pardon for the plane hijacking that brought him to @entity1			0
hearing nothing back , he then wrote the @entity96 in @entity48 to ask if a plea deal could be worked out to take into account the time he had already served in @entity1			0
@entity3 again heard no reply , but his daughters were given @entity5 citizenship and passports , and last year , they left to go live with his family in the @entity105			1
now , @entity3 says he would like to be reunited with his two young daughters			0
but , unlike other @entity5 fugitives in @entity1 -- some with million - dollar bounties on their heads -- his attempts to turn himself in have been met with disinterest from the @entity5			1
the @entity30 has placed @entity1 on the list of countries that support state terrorism , along with @entity115 and @entity116 , for providing a haven for fugitives from @entity5 and international justice			1
" no one 's harboring me , " @entity3 told @entity2 in an interview may			1
" i am trying to go back			0
" on monday , he said his frustration had boiled over and he had planned a hunger strike in front of the @entity125 in @entity0			0
instead , he met with @entity5 diplomats who he said apologized for the delay in issuing his temporary passport			0
@entity3 said he may be back in the @entity5 within a week , where he expects to be spending more time in jail			1
he is hopeful that the years he served in @entity1 's prisons will reduce any sentence he faces back home			1
" i am ready to discuss it and debate the issue in a court of law if necessary , " he said			0
" because i am sure that any @entity5 can understand that 15 years in prison in a communist country is 15 years			2
it 's not a @entity141 situation			0
