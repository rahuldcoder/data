-- for the past few weeks my email box has been slowly , inexorably , filling up with @entity3 invites			1
a seminar here , a reception there , a late nightcap thrown in			2
everyone , it seems , has an event -- and they want you to attend			1
there are the governments bringing along their hot - shot ministers , with whom you can schmooze over canapes ; the consulting groups holding parties to reveal their latest surveys ; the @entity22 seeking attention and coverage for their causes ; the companies screaming " we 're here , come and meet our ceo ! " like opportunistic birds pecking juicy flies from the head of a wallowing hippo , they are feeding on the @entity34 's ability to attract the world 's biggest political , economic and corporate players			1
governments meet corporations ; corporations meet clients ; the press meets everyone			1
all have a story to tell and an agenda to sell			2
allow me to give you a taste of some of this year 's events : one company has invited me to a " thought provoking breakfast discussion on the future of human capital " ( dress code : business casual ; funny - i was going to wear my ski gear ) ; another is offering a session on " re-defining success in a digital age			2
" does n't salary count anymore ? then of course there is the need to have a @entity65			2
one consulting group has tied its @entity3 invite to a photography exhibition : " game changing -- now is the time ! " everyone wants to be seen to be game changing			1
there are some obvious winners			0
the @entity74 , sponsored by @entity75 and the @entity76 , will celebrate the two week countdown to the @entity78 in @entity79			0
since it 's late -- from 10 ' til midnight - and also sponsored by @entity76 business , i predict with confidence that this will be both full and very lively			2
then of course there are the hardy perennials , such as @entity87 with its global ceo survey launch , featuring cocktails			0
there are some events that you just do n't miss ( if , that is , you are lucky enough to be invited )			0
the informal closed breakfast session with @entity96 is always a fascinating chance to hear the 91 - year - old president of @entity99 speak with prescience on world issues			2
it alone is worth the trip to @entity3			1
everyone from @entity106 's @entity105 to the government of @entity108 wants a bit of your time during the @entity3 week			1
and all of this is on top of the 88 pages of official panels , seminars and discussions			0
crucially , invitations are always described as " individual and non-transferable " as if there are hordes of interlopers waiting to freeload			0
to guarantee your place it is not enough to simply be a @entity3 attendee , you need to be invited to each specific event too			1
@entity3 is probably the world 's most elite society , but it dresses itself up as a non-elite event			1
you must wear a specially coloured badge , which shrieks your status to others			0
there are events to which you may be granted admission or be barred from joining			0
even the hotel that you are allocated speaks volumes ( please @entity34 , some will beg , do n't put me in @entity139 this year ... pretty please ! )			0
but there is one meeting place for everyone at @entity3 , where status goes out of the window , and who you are matters less than if you can pay for the ridiculously priced drinks : the @entity148			1
late , very late at night , they pack them in with bone crushing disregard for comfort			0
everyone from interns and volunteers , to ceos and government leaders - the lot			0
drunken singing and high jinks ensue			0
this is a truly @entity163 experience because the @entity148 is neutral territory			0
it does n't matter how you got to @entity3 , or why you are there ; once you 're in the @entity148 all that matters is that you drink , sing and make merry			1
then the early hour arrives , and the chance for a couple of hours ' sleep , before it 's time to attend that morning breakfast discussion , redefining something or other			1
you will only wish you could remember what			0

governments meet corporations ; corporations meet clients and the press meet everyone
