-- during his travels around the nation , meeting countless working men and women , @entity1 has certainly seen many different ways to make a living -- some more dangerous than others			1
before becoming the host of @entity0 's new series " @entity12 ta do it , " @entity1 hosted a @entity14 series called " @entity15			1
" after an episode that took place on an oil rig , @entity1 received a job - safety question from a fan			1
" my husband works on the oil rigs as a well tester , " wrote " suzemommy			2
" " we watched you folks do so without any eye protection ! are you crazy ? drilling a hole with no protective eyewear ? between him , a well tester , and me , a workers ' compensation lawyer , we 're cringing ! somebody could lose an eye ! seriously -- @entity36 , fellas ! i would expect better from the @entity14 ! ! " @entity1 responded , " i sincerely appreciate your concern for me , and agree that stupidity plays an ongoing role in my professional and personal life			1
but believe me , i have no wish to be injured on the job			0
however , it is not the objective of @entity15 to conform to any particular set of safety standards , other than those dictated by the people for whom i happen to be working at the time			1
i take my cues from them , and i assume whatever risk they assume , for the most part			0
in the end , we hope to capture an honest look at what life is like for the workers in a particular venue			1
we do not aspire to set an example , or be a poster child for @entity68 or any particular industry			0
i realize that may sound controversial , but it 's the truth , and not nearly as inflammatory as what i 'm going to say next			1
ready ? of all the platitudes automatically embraced in the workplace -- and there are many -- there is none more pervasive , erroneous , overused , and dangerous , than " safety first ! " in my opinion			1
i have heard this slogan countless times			0
i have seen it emblazoned on banners , t - shirts and hats			0
i have sat through mandatory briefings and slideshows and presentations designed to " protect me from the hazards at hand			0
" and i have listened as safety officers and foreman have run down list after list of @entity68 requirements , all apparently construed to remind me that nothing is more important to the employer than my own well - being			1
what a load of unmitigated nonsense			0
in the jobs i have seen thus far , i can tell you with certainty , that safety , while always a major consideration , is never the priority			1
is it important ? of course			1
but is it more important than getting the job done ? no. not even close			2
making money is more important than safety -- always -- and it 's very dangerous in my opinion to ignore that			1
when we start to believe that someone else is more concerned about our own safety than we are , we become complacent , and then , we get careless			1
when a business tells you that they are more concerned with your safety than anything else , beware			1
they are not being honest			2
they are hedging their own bets , and following the advice of lawyers hired to protect them from lawsuits arising from accidents			0
you are correct to suggest that wearing safety glasses would have made the task at hand safer			2
but why stop there ? wearing a helmet would have made it safer still			0
and wearing a steel mesh shark suit would have made it really , super safe			0
i know that sounds glib , and i know that many will wish to scold me for appearing cavalier			0
but really , i 'm not			0
in a car , i wear a safety belt			2
on a motorcycle , i wear a helmet			0
not because it 's the law , but because it seems a reasonable precaution			2
and ultimately , the only one responsible for my own safety is me			2
( besides , if the government were really concerned with my safety above all else , would n't they drop the legal speed limit to 30 miles an hour and make cars out of rubber ? ) again , you 're right -- i probably should have been wearing safety glasses , not because safety is first , but because i like to hedge my bets			1
we can always be safer			0
we can always assume less risk			0
but if safety were really first , i would n't travel at all , or engage in any activity that required me to assume any risk			2
and i certainly would n't be hosting @entity15			0

author : it 's dangerous to ignore this idea : making money is more important than safety
@entity1 , host of @entity0 's " @entity172 , " says safety is never really the priority
@entity1 : businesses that say they 're most concerned with safety are not being honest
