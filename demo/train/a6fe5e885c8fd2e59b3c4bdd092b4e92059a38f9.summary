-- the @entity2 cabinet is scheduled to meet tuesday to discuss an agreement between political groups and the ruling military council on election policies , the status of the country 's unpopular emergency law and other issues			1
some activists said the agreement does n't go far enough to meet the demands of the popular uprising that led to the end of country 's longstanding regime , while other political groups said the agreement represented progress			0
the agreement , reached saturday , includes promises to open more @entity2 parliament seats to political parties and consider canceling the country 's emergency law			1
the agreement also includes a promise to consider abolishing military tribunals and to consider adopting a 1952 law that opposition groups hope would prevent former president @entity33 's @entity32 from having a role in national politics for up to 10 years			1
also included are plans to draft a document to guide the creation of a new constitution and a call for presidential elections following a national referendum on adopting the new ruling document			0
the coalition of parties had also sought an agreement to hold presidential elections immediately after parliamentary voting scheduled for november , as well as a promise to hand control to a civilian government next year			2
the deal failed to go far enough , said @entity53 , a founding member of the no to @entity56 movement , who called the decision by a majority of party representatives little more than " treachery			0
" " these parties were fooled if they think they accomplished something , " said @entity61 , who called for renewed protests against the military council			2
the agreement comes amid rising dissatisfaction with the council , which took control in february after widespread popular demonstrations forced @entity33 to step aside			0
following an attack on the @entity74 embassy in @entity75 this month , the council reinstated the widely unpopular emergency law that many in the opposition felt was used by @entity33 to suppress dissent			1
despite the concerns , the agreement is a " positive step toward true democracy , " said @entity84 , the spokesman for the @entity85 and a leading figure in the @entity87			1
" yes , abolishing the emergency law was a main demand of the january 25th revolution and the council promised to abolish it , but the reality on the ground is that there are many forces debating including former members of the regime that come in different faces			2
military leaders plan more meetings with political parties to iron out more differences , said @entity104 , a spokesman for the @entity105			0
" pleasing everyone is impossible , " @entity104 said .			0
