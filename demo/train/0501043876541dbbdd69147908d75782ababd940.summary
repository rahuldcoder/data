@entity0 -- former president @entity2 left the @entity3 more than five years ago and has since stayed out of most @entity0 debates			1
but it would be hard to tell that if you have been listening to @entity7 over the past month			1
from defending her record at the @entity11 to defining her economic vision , @entity8 has used @entity2 as her primary rhetorical device to both explain her vision for the future and defend her past			1
" the biggest accomplishment in the four years as secretary of state was helping to restore @entity18 leadership and we did that in a number of ways , " @entity8 said earlier this month before faulting @entity2 for the @entity18 standing on the world stage when he left the @entity3 in 2009			2
@entity27 have always been fond of faulting @entity2 and it was part of president @entity31 's 2012 reelection campaign			1
but the fact that @entity8 , who is admittedly thinking about running for president in 2016 , is attacking him says as much about how she views her future as it does about the state of the @entity38			1
the former first lady has started pointing to the @entity2 administration when talking about the turmoil in @entity42 , too			1
when pressed about @entity31 removing troops from the country , @entity8 regularly points out -- and did so at a @entity1 town hall on tuesday -- that the withdrawal decision was made by @entity2 , not @entity31			2
when asked earlier this month in @entity47 about troops in @entity42 and the failure to get a status of forces agreement , @entity8 said , " the deadline on @entity42 was set by the prior administration , that if there were not a status of forces agreement ... there would not be @entity18 troops			0
" strategy not without problems democrats close to @entity8 love the @entity2 lines			1
" seems to me @entity7 thinks @entity2 was a terrible president , " @entity61 , a @entity1 contributor and a longtime @entity8 confidant , said before enumerating a number of ways he feels @entity2 failed , including two " botched " wars , turning " a massive surplus into a crippling debt " and presiding " over an economic collapse			1
" " i hope she keeps it up , " @entity61 said			0
but the strategy does not come without problems			0
while @entity2 was unpopular in office -- and still is with @entity27 -- his standing has improved since leaving @entity0			1
his overall approval rating hit a seven - year high in 2013 with 47 % of @entity18 approving how he handled his tenure			0
while 50 % said they disapproved , the trend has been been up in recent years			0
most presidents experience this when they leave the job			0
by bashing @entity2 , @entity8 is also looking backward			2
her book tour / campaign has carefully tried to keep her looking forward			0
she told an audience in @entity89 on wednesday that she does n't think much about her legacy because she is " very present - oriented and future - oriented			2
" @entity38 see any strategy that has @entity8 looking backward as a winner for them			1
" she is the personification of a political system that voters believe needs new blood and new energy , " said @entity94 , a @entity38 strategist and former @entity96 spokesman			1
" so looking back , @entity8 may feel that she has an advantage because she gets to point fingers at @entity2 , but it is problematic for a candidate who is essentially part of the status quo for the last 25 years , " @entity94 said			1
people close to @entity8 reject that idea			0
" part of charting a new course for the future is a clear - eyed assessment of where we are and how we got here , " @entity61 said			0
" @entity7 is simply speaking her mind			2
radical candor -- i love it			0
" the enemy of my enemy is my friend for @entity8 , bashing @entity2 might be more than just a standard red and blue tactic , though			2
in front of a liberal audience at the @entity126 in @entity0 last month , @entity8 brought out her most fiery @entity2 rhetoric			2
the speech was , in part , an attempt to make inroads with @entity27 , some of whom have been apprehensive about @entity8 's more moderate positions			1
@entity2 , she said , " allowed the evolution of an entire shadow banking system that operated without accountability " and failed " to invest adequately in infrastructure , education , basic research and then the housing crash , the financial crisis hit like a flash flood			2
" @entity8 then went on to say that the @entity2 years showed that " we can turn surpluses into debt , we can return to rising defects , that is what happens when your only policy prescription is to cut taxes for the wealthy			2
" @entity1 contributor and progressive activist @entity154 said if she were in @entity8 's camp , bashing @entity2 " is exactly what i would be doing			1
" @entity154 is an outspoken @entity8 critic			0
in a recent @entity1 opinion piece she asked , " does @entity7 have to be so boring ? " other than changing her positions on a number of fundamental issues , @entity154 said , siding with the left by showing her distaste for a shared bogeyman could be effective			2
" he is a universally known quantity , " @entity154 said			0
" it is a way for her to run against something that is concrete because she ca n't run against president @entity31			0
" to @entity154 , @entity2 is @entity8 's foil against the left			1
she shows that she shares their opinion on him , but subtly says to progressives that she does n't " want too much noise or else " you will get another @entity2			1
do n't elevate anyone current few president run for elected office again and @entity2 seems more content these days with painting than politicking			1
by focusing on @entity2 , @entity8 is n't elevating any other potential rivals who do n't have the name recognition she does			1
when @entity8 is asked about gridlock in @entity0 or the lack of legislation getting passed on @entity189 , she regularly mentions @entity3 or congressional republicans in general terms and never mentions some of her possible 2016 contenders -- like sen. @entity193 or sen. @entity194 - by name			0
" there is no distinctive @entity38 head of the party for her to post up against , " @entity94 said			2
" so she is again going to this habitual reflex : just blame @entity2			0
" on the contrary to @entity8 , republicans like @entity193 and @entity194 are ready and willing to be mentioned with @entity8			0
@entity194 regularly jumps at the opportunity to fault @entity8 and frequently says the @entity204 terrorist attack should disqualify @entity8 from holding higher office in the future			0
asked about @entity194 's attacks last week , @entity8 told @entity208 that " he can talk about whatever he wants to talk about			0
and if he decides to run , he 'll be fair game too			0
" @entity8 did not , however , refer to @entity194 by name in her answer			0
@entity193 , too , is eager to confront @entity8			0
" secretary @entity8 from the beginning has stonewalled on this rather than acting as a partner getting to the bottom of what happened , " the @entity215 @entity38 said on @entity1 's " @entity216 " after the town hall			1
this strategy , @entity94 says , helps elevate their profile on a level with hers and may be the most potent way to build " a strong national profile as a potential @entity38 candidate			1

@entity7 has used @entity2 to defend her record , explain vision for the future
@entity27 *applaud* her strategy but there are risks as @entity2 's popularity rises
@entity38 strategist says pointing fingers at @entity2 wo n't help *member* of " status quo "
