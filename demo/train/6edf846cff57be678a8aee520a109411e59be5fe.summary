-- relatives of @entity2 want proof that the terrorist leader is dead and are calling for an investigation into how he was killed , according to @entity5 , an author who helped one of @entity2 's sons write a memoir			1
" they just really want some answers , and they would just really like to know what exactly happened , why they were n't called , " said @entity5 , who worked with @entity11 to pen a memoir titled " @entity13			0
" the @entity14 says @entity15 killed @entity2 during a may 2 raid in @entity17 , @entity18 , where he was hiding out			1
on wednesday , a key lawmaker on @entity20 said the death of @entity2 presents an opportunity to " break the back " of @entity24			1
the forces collected a trove of intelligence from the compound and later buried @entity2 's body at sea			1
while the @entity33 administration has decided not to release photos of the slain @entity2 , some @entity14 lawmakers will be allowed to view them			2
@entity2 's relatives " would like to have been able to have witnessed seeing the body , at least identified the body , because , you know how it is in the @entity40 so many times : they really need proof or people start believing -- this has been discussed by a lot more people than me -- that many people will not believe that he 's dead , " @entity5 told @entity0 wednesday			1
her comments come a day after a statement from @entity11 and his brothers was provided to the @entity53			1
asked about the statement , @entity5 said @entity11 -- who has publicly denounced his father 's violence -- contacted her and told her he has some things to say			2
she said she prepared a letter for him and he approved it			0
another family member had gotten an attorney to write a letter about what relatives were thinking and feeling and @entity5 said it was decided to go with the attorney 's letter			2
the statement published in the @entity53 is from @entity2 's sons -- " the lawful children and heirs " of the notorious @entity24 leader			1
it says that despite the extensive coverage of his death , " we are not convinced on the available evidence in the absence of ( a ) dead body , photographs , and video evidence that our natural father is dead			0
" " we seek such conclusive evidence to believe the stories published in relation to 2 may 2011 operation @entity87 as declared by the president of @entity14 @entity33 in his speech that he authorized the said operation and killing of @entity2 and later confirmed his death , " they said			2
the statement argued that if @entity2 has been " summarily executed , " " international law " might have been " blatantly violated " and that @entity14 legal standards were ignored			2
the statement cites the trials for late @entity99 president @entity98 and late @entity101 strongman @entity100 , and notes that @entity2 did n't get a " fair trial " or " presumption of innocence until proven guilty by a court of law			2
" " if @entity2 has been killed in that operation as ( the ) president of @entity14 has claimed then we are just in questioning as per media reports that why an unarmed man was not arrested and tried in a court of law so that truth is revealed to the people of the world			2
" " we maintain that arbitrary killing is not a solution to political problems and crime 's adjudication as justice must be seen to be done , " the statement said			0
three other men , including one of @entity2 's sons , and a woman were killed in the raid , and @entity2 's 29 - year - old @entity128 wife , @entity127 , was wounded			1
all three of @entity2 's wives and a number of children , some of whom were @entity2 's , were taken into @entity18 custody after the raid			1
a @entity14 official identified the other two women as @entity138 , also known as " @entity139 , " and @entity140 , or " @entity141			0
" " it is also unworthy of the special forces to shoot unarmed female family members ... killing a female and that of one of his sons , " the statement said			1
" in making this statement , we want to remind the world that @entity11 ( @entity2 ) , the fourth - born son of our father , always disagreed with our father regarding any violence and always sent messages to our father , that he must change his ways and that no civilians should be attacked under any circumstances			2
" despite the difficulty of publicly disagreeing with our father , he never hesitated to condemn any violent attacks made by anyone , and expressed sorrow for the victims of any and all attacks			0
as he condemned our father , we now condemn the president of the @entity14 for ordering the execution of unarmed men and women , " the statement said			0
it also urged @entity18 " to release and hand over " the wives and the children of @entity2			1
the authors of the statement called for a @entity179 investigation into the event and said they will pursue justice in bodies such as the @entity183 if questions are n't answered			0
a senior @entity14 official wednesday angrily rejected the charge that international law was violated			0
" there is an inherent right of self - defense enshrined in the @entity179 charter within @entity192			0
this is a man who is a terrorist , who declared war on the @entity14 , killed @entity14 and continued to plan operations against the @entity14 and its allies , " the official said			0
on @entity20 , one lawmaker was talking about the opportunity the death of @entity2 presents			1
@entity204 chairman @entity203 , @entity205 , said that although @entity24 is still alive and well , " they are hurt , they are damaged			0
their inspirational and operational leader has been taken off the battlefield , which is a huge opportunity for us			0
" the confusion with them is opportunity for us and this is the time to step on the gas and break their back			0
" @entity203 raised the possibility that there are @entity18 officials who knew about @entity2 's hideway in the country			1
he spoke of a " confusing " relationship with @entity18 , one which was cooperative at times , taking thousands of casualties battling extremists and helping arrest hundreds of @entity24 and @entity231 leaders , bomb makers , financiers and weapons dealers			1
however , @entity203 maintained there are renegade intelligence officers and others in the @entity18 government who are sympathetic toward the @entity231 and @entity24			1
the raid in which @entity2 was killed dealt a blow to the relationship between the @entity14 and @entity18			1
the revelation that @entity2 had been living in @entity18 has fueled suspicions that @entity18 officials knew the whereabouts of the terrorist leader , while @entity18 has complained about the @entity14 military incursion			1
but while the ties between the @entity250 and @entity18 's intelligence agency are strained , they are not shut down , another @entity14 official said			2
this official , who did not want to be identified for safety concerns , said both sides need to continue working together			0
" both sides understand the importance of the relationship , " the official said			0
" cooperation is continuing , discussions are continuing , but there are issues to work through			0
" sen. @entity266 , @entity267 , chairman of the @entity268 , plans to go to @entity18 soon , a @entity264 source familiar with his plans said wednesday			1
he has visited the country at other times and has the trust and respect of many senior @entity18 officials			0
most recently , @entity266 visited @entity18 to help defuse tensions over the detention of @entity276 , a @entity250 contractor who was jailed in @entity18 after he shot and killed two @entity18 men in what he said was a robbery attempt			1
he was released from jail after compensation was paid to the victims ' families			0
@entity285 spokesman @entity284 said the administration is encouraging @entity266 's trip			2
" we think it 's important as part of the overall efforts by the @entity14 government to continue our collaborative relationship with @entity18 and the cooperation that we have seen in the past , " @entity284 said			2
" while we do n't see eye to eye on the issues , that cooperation has led to some very important successes in our war against @entity24			0
we are working at the administration level to continue our consultations with @entity18 leaders , to continue that kind of cooperation , and are glad to see senator @entity266 make that trip as well			1
" in the aftermath of the @entity14 raid on @entity2 's compound , @entity18 interior minister @entity305 told @entity0 tuesday that the @entity14 will be given access to @entity2 's wives and children " so they can interrogate them , they can interview them			1
" a senior @entity18 intelligence source had said earlier that the @entity14 could question @entity2 's wives only if their " country of origin has been asked for permission			1
" @entity305 did not say when or where the @entity14 would be able to question the wives			0
@entity324 spokesman col. @entity323 said tuesday @entity14 and @entity18 officials were discussing the matter			0
@entity284 said the administration is optimistic that @entity14 - @entity18 cooperation " will continue with regards to " access to @entity2 's wives " and also to the materials that were collected by the @entity18 after the @entity14 commandos left " the compound where they killed @entity2			1
he described the @entity14 - @entity18 relationship as " important and complicated			0
" @entity0 's @entity335 and @entity336 contributed to this report			0
