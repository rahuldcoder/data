@entity0 -- some @entity0 may want to reconsider exclaiming " thank @entity2 " when arriving at their destination subway station beginning monday			1
a coalition of atheist groups will place ads in @entity0 subway stations next week			1
or at least that 's what a coalition of eight atheist organizations are hoping , having purchased a month - long campaign that will place their posters in a dozen busy subway stations throughout @entity16			1
the advertisements ask the question , written simply over an image of a blue sky with wispy white clouds : " a million @entity0 are good without @entity2			1
are you ? " on october 26 , a dozen bustling @entity0 subway stations will be adorned with the ads as " part of a coordinated multi-organizational advertising campaign designed to raise awareness about people who do n't believe in a god " , according to a statement from the group , the @entity32			1
@entity0 's subway system is one of the busiest in the world with more than 5 million riders per day and more than 1.6 billion total passengers in 2008 , according to the @entity38			1
recognizing this , the @entity32 of @entity39 decided the " best bang for the buck " was to place posters in popular subway stations to capitalize on the amount of potential viewers , says @entity47 , executive director of the @entity48 , one of the associated atheist groups			1
@entity51 says the ambitions behind the advertisements are threefold			0
first , the coalition hopes the promotion will enhance awareness of @entity0 's secular community			1
he explained that the coalition also hopes to encourage " talking and thinking about religion and morality , " as well as support involvement in groups that encourage a sense of a social community for non-believing @entity0			2
@entity66 , president of the @entity67 of @entity0 , another member group of the coalition , said the ads are in no way an anti-religious campaign			1
they are looking to reach out to more people who have similar feelings , but might not be aware of an outlet to express their beliefs , he said			0
@entity66 and @entity51 cite the @entity78 , released earlier this year , as evidence of a shift away from organized religion			0
those checking " none " for religion rose from 8 percent of the population in 1990 to 15 percent in 2008 , effectively making " no religion " the fastest growing religious identification in the @entity88			0
@entity51 said that the " million " @entity0 nonbelievers mentioned in the advertisements is the result of an extrapolation based on the survey 's findings			2
with more than 8 million residents living in @entity0 's five boroughs , the organization projects more than a million potential atheist @entity0			2
@entity51 said individuals " do n't need religion to be good people and productive members of society " and ultimately he feels that groups of nonbelievers are " adding to cultural life of @entity0			1
" the @entity105 , which is a national organization that helps local groups advocate atheist ideas , approached the @entity0 nonbeliever associations in august with an offer of a donation from an anonymous source to help pay for the subway station ad campaign			2
the donation amount was for exactly $ 25,000 and specifically allocated for the subway advertising promotion			0
@entity66 says the groups involved expect no substantial backlash over their ads. since news of the campaign was made public early this week " reaction has been mixed , " @entity51 said			0
he emphasizes that the @entity32 of reason ads are not " forcing issues , they 're just getting ideas out there , " with the hope of fostering discussion in @entity0			2
the ads are " not poking fun at religion and not being outright nasty , " he said			0
a year ago some unease was caused by advertisements that ran inside subway cars promoting @entity136			0
while the ads themselves were n't controversial , they were partially funded by an imam of a @entity142 mosque who served a character witness for convicted 1993 @entity146 bombing mastermind @entity145			2
in a statement to @entity1 , @entity38 spokesman @entity147 said , " the @entity38 maintains basic advertising guidelines with prohibitions on nudity , four - letter words , and the like			0
beyond that , to accord with the @entity154 , our advertising guidelines are written so as to not prohibit the free exercise of religion or abridge the freedom of speech			0
" according to the @entity161 in their statement , the @entity0 campaign is just one component of a " nationwide effort " by the @entity105 that will see billboards and postings in transit systems across the @entity88 .			0

on october 26 , @entity0 subway stations will be adorned with the ads
