there are many groups listed by the @entity2 as terrorists			0
but few fit the classic definition -- threatening and inflicting terror on a civilian population -- better than @entity8 in northern @entity9			1
what 's more difficult to work out , beyond @entity8 's hatred for everything modern and secular , is its ideology , structure and affiliations			1
@entity8 's modus operandi is all too clear : brutal and indiscriminate killings of both @entity27 and @entity28 in northern @entity9 , the bombings of churches and suicide attacks in the federal capital , @entity22 , including the devastating car bombing of the @entity25 compound in 2011			1
recent attacks in the northeast , mainly in rural areas of @entity32 , have left dozens dead			0
victims are shot at point - blank range or stabbed and mutilated			0
some attacks have lasted hours without any police or military intervention			0
in the first three months of this year , @entity38 estimates , @entity8 was responsible for the deaths of more than 1,500 people			1
in april , the group added mass abduction to its repertoire with the kidnapping of more than 200 girls ages 16 to 18 from a boarding school in @entity32			1
" slavery is allowed in my religion , and i shall capture people and make them slaves , " @entity47 , the leader of @entity8 , declared in a chilling video released in may			2
it was a message typical of a medieval mindset , reflecting the admiration for the @entity56 that inspired his predecessor , @entity57			0
@entity8 and other factions have carried out kidnappings on a smaller scale , targeting @entity62 workers and tourists			2
rescue attempts -- by @entity9 security forces and in one instance in concert with @entity69 special forces -- have ended with the deaths of hostages			1
in one instance last year , @entity8 allegedly received a substantial ransom ( rumored to be in excess of $ 3 million ) for the release of a @entity77 family abducted in northern @entity78			2
why would anyone join a group so focused on killing , maiming and kidnapping civilians , one with such an incoherent , apocalyptic but resolutely backward mindset ? @entity8 , whose real name translates as the @entity85 , feeds on the poverty and discrimination felt by many young @entity28 in northern @entity9			1
@entity47 persistently recalls perceived persecution of @entity9 's muslims by @entity27 , among whom president @entity88 is the latest " oppressor			1
" a lure for young men in a region where unemployment is pervasive , the promise of a weapon and plunder has been enticing to hundreds of young men			1
in a recent report , the @entity100 noted that " most @entity9 are poorer today than they were at independence in 1960 ... and the government is unable to provide security , good roads , water , health and reliable education			2
" the central government 's heavy - handed and frequently untargeted anti-terrorism campaign has radicalized enough young men to sustain @entity8			1
the country 's own @entity112 last year accused the military of arbitrary killings , torture and rape in its campaign against the group			0
@entity88 's declaration of a state of emergency a year ago in three northern states failed to halt or even stem the tide of killings			0
@entity125 , a former @entity126 ambassador to @entity9 and now a fellow at the @entity128 , says , " the security forces have proven remarkably ineffective in securing territory or people within the areas under the state of emergency			2
" this makes for fertile territory for @entity8 , with its demand for @entity138 law and rejection of all things @entity62 ( especially education for girls )			2
it is no coincidence that @entity9 and @entity145 see the most militant attacks on schools and colleges			2
among @entity8 's targets in recent months : a secondary school in @entity151 , where 42 students were killed , and another on an agricultural college near @entity154 in @entity155 , where more than 40 were killed			1
@entity8 's outlook and that of the @entity145 @entity56 have similarities , even if their origins are very different			1
both have thrived in ( usually rural ) areas where the state 's authority is weak , exploiting corruption and sectarian fault lines			0
both have also targeted workers involved in trying to eradicate polio			0
both recruit from islamic schools ( whose students are called almajiris in northern @entity9 ) where memorizing the @entity173 is the core of the curriculum			2
the emergence of civilian vigilante groups in cities like @entity179 has driven @entity8 into the remote northeastern corner of @entity9 , close to the borders with @entity78 and @entity182			1
it has a network of camps in the thick forests of the @entity186 , which is where at least some of the abducted schoolgirls are likely to have been taken			0
@entity8 and @entity189 there 's no firm evidence as yet that @entity8 has ambitions beyond @entity9 , though its campaign of terror has spilled into remote parts of @entity78 and it appears to have informal links with militant @entity198 groups in @entity199 and @entity200			1
and for a while in 2012 , @entity47 sought refuge in @entity203 in northern @entity199 , a town then held by the @entity204 , after being wounded in a shootout with @entity9 security forces			2
@entity47 has declared his allegiance to @entity189 leader @entity208			0
but @entity8 's structure and ideology are so opaque and its focus so local that @entity189 's leadership has thus far -- at least publicly -- shunned it			1
other factions that have broken with @entity47 may have broader ambitions			1
@entity215 , an expert on @entity8 and its several offshoots , wrote in a recent edition of the @entity219 's @entity218 that some leaders " are uniquely capable of expanding @entity8 's international connections to @entity221 ( @entity221 ) , @entity222 " in @entity223 and other militant groups			1
@entity215 , an analyst with the @entity226 , says that @entity227 , said to have masterminded the bombing of the @entity25 building in @entity22 , has trained with @entity222			0
another senior figure , @entity232 , " became the leader of an @entity221 training camp " before being killed in 2012			0
@entity232 led the most effective of several factions : @entity234 , whose full name is @entity236 for the @entity237 in @entity238			0
the group emerged in 2012 in opposition to @entity47 's targeting of @entity9 civilians			1
its members are said to have received training with jihadist groups in @entity246 , and it appears to have a broader canvas than does @entity47			2
in january 2013 , @entity234 attacked a convoy of @entity9 troops on their way to support the @entity77 operation against @entity189 in @entity199			2
it has also targeted western workers , killing seven engineers in @entity256 early last year			0
just who leads @entity234 is a mystery ; its videos show only veiled men			0
but according to the @entity100 , the group is now led by @entity262 , who has close links with @entity189 in the @entity264 and has profited from its part in the kidnapping business			0
yet another faction called itself @entity189 in the @entity269 , a nod toward @entity189 in the @entity264 and its ambitions for a broad @entity273 jihadist front			0
the group 's abduction and eventual murder of two foreign construction workers in 2012 bore the hallmarks of @entity279 , an @entity189 in the @entity281 leader in @entity199 who has turned kidnapping into a lucrative business			0
a more dangerous beast no one ( apart from @entity8 's leaders ) believes the group can overthrow the @entity9 state			1
it has no presence in the oil - rich south ( even if @entity47 threatens to attack oil refineries there ) , and its fighters probably number in the hundreds at most			0
but it can drain the federal government of resources , damage @entity9 's international reputation and turn swathes of northern @entity9 into no - go zones			1
( the governor of @entity32 admitted it was too dangerous for him to travel to the @entity303 area			0
) the @entity100 says the fractured militant groups in northern @entity9 are " unlikely ever to be completely suppressed , unless the government wins local hearts and minds by implementing fundamental political reforms to address bad governance , corruption and underdevelopment			1
" there have been few signs of such an approach -- and its absence may usher in a much worse scenario			0
greater cooperation between @entity8 , @entity234 and other militant factions in the region could create an altogether more dangerous beast , according to @entity215 , creating " a multimillion - dollar " terrorism economy " in the southern @entity322 that fuels corruption and raises tensions between neighboring countries and the region 's @entity28 and @entity27			1

@entity8 , blamed in hundreds of deaths , added mass abduction to its repertoire in april
@entity85 's promises of weapons , plunder lure @entity9 's young men
there 's no evidence that @entity8 has aspirations beyond @entity9
but *splinter* groups may have broader ambitions
