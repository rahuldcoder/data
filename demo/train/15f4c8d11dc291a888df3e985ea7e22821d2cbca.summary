@entity0 -- it was a good idea back in 2008 , in the final days of the @entity4 administration			2
with almost no opposition , @entity5 passed a new law to protect immigrant children from sex traffickers trying to bring them to the @entity10			1
it required judges to hold hearings for youngsters from countries other than neighboring @entity16 and @entity17 , preventing them from possibly getting turned away at the border			0
more than five years later , though , the @entity20 is having unintended consequences			0
it contributes to the surge of child migrants from @entity25 overwhelming the @entity10 immigration system			1
now some in @entity5 want to change the law -- a possibility that could bring more unintended consequences			1
how did a law aimed at sex traffickers play a role in @entity25 kids coming here ? a desire to crack down on the global child slave trade led to the law named for a 19th century @entity39 abolitionist			1
president @entity4 signed it the month before he left the @entity41			0
it ensured that children who came to the @entity10 got a full immigration hearing instead of being turned away or sent back			1
the goal of the hearing ? to determine if the children had a valid claim for asylum			2
here 's the catch : the immigration courts are so backlogged that it can take years for a child 's hearing date to come around			1
as they wait , most stay with relatives or friends already in the country , attend school and generally go about their lives			0
it did n't take long for word to spread to families in @entity25 : send the kids , and they 'll end up in immigration limbo with little threat of deportation -- all the while getting a decent education			1
not in my backyard : communities protest surge of immigrant kids why does it take so long for a hearing ? one reason is that @entity5 has failed to provide enough money for timely hearings , noted @entity80 , director of communications and public affairs at the @entity82 , an independent non-profit			1
from 2002 - 2013 , @entity5 increased spending on immigration enforcement by 300 % , compared with a 70 % increase for the immigration courts , she said			1
now the average wait for a hearing is well over a year -- and federal agents have too many cases to chase after everyone who skips a court date			2
what else is behind the wave of children from @entity25 ? rampant gang crime and faltering economies in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 have pushed a growing number of people to want to leave , especially those with relatives in the @entity10 , the @entity82 says			1
sophisticated smuggling rings flourish with promises to take children through @entity16 and across the border into the @entity10 -- even if it takes more than one attempt			0
their fee : several thousand dollars at least			0
then in 2012 , president @entity113 's administration stopped deporting some children living illegally in the @entity10			0
it was part of a broader effort to overhaul the immigration system that has stalled due to @entity119 opposition			0
the policy change applied only to those who had been in the country at least five years , but the smugglers ignored that nuance in their sales pitch			0
how many children are we talking about ? the government says up to 90,000 children will arrive on their own this year , compared with about 39,000 the @entity130 detained last year			0
according to @entity130 statistics , 98 % of them come from @entity16 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
the statistics show the influx from @entity16 dropped dramatically in the past two years , while the flow from the other three rose			0
poll : most give @entity113 , @entity119 in @entity5 , thumbs down on border crisis what happens when the kids get here ? the goal is to enter the @entity10 immigration system , so many approach border patrol agents to get taken into custody when crossing the @entity143 into @entity144 from @entity16			1
if from @entity16 , they can be turned back -- what is called a voluntary repatriation -- after an initial screening at the border			0
all others get held by the @entity130 for up to three days , then must be turned over to the @entity151 , a part of the @entity153			0
during the process , some get bused or flown to holding facilities in other states , leading to protests by local residents unhappy that the immigrants are coming to their town			1
according to the @entity82 , 90 % of those turned over to the @entity151 eventually get released into the care of a parent , relative or family friend while they await an immigration hearing			2
stories from a desert bus station can the 2008 law be changed to help fix the problem ? maybe			2
republicans and some @entity172 want to change it so all child migrants can be sent back without a full immigration hearing , like those from neighboring @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity172 leaders oppose revising the law , saying the government can speed up immigration hearings without any changes			1
@entity5 : 12 work days to compromise on border crisis a plan unveiled tuesday by two @entity144 legislators -- @entity119 sen. @entity185 and @entity172 rep. @entity186 -- sought a middle ground			1
it would stop requiring hearings but allow children to request one , which would have to take place within 72 hours			0
senate majority leader @entity193 of @entity194 told reporters the proposal was " too broad , " adding " it does more than just address the border problem			0
" what 's the hangup ? another @entity200 , sen. @entity201 of @entity202 , said children at immigration hearings must have legal representation			0
the @entity185 - @entity186 proposal lacks such a requirement , but relies on existing law that calls for the government to seek free legal counsel for the youngsters			2
@entity185 warned that would prolong the hearing process to " serve the goal of some of the people who want to come because it would be years before they were ever deported			1
" the @entity41 says it is open to any formulation that speeds up the process while respecting the rights of the children			2
what is the government doing about this ? @entity113 has asked @entity5 for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds to deal with the problem , including $ 1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children in government custody			1
another $ 1.6 billion would bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers , and $ 300 million would help @entity16 and the three @entity25 governments discourage parents from paying smugglers to get their children to the @entity10			1
so far , republicans are balking at @entity113 's request , saying they will come up with a smaller plan , including changes to the 2008 law			2
meanwhile , the @entity241 announced monday it sent about 40 recent arrivals -- including adults and children -- back to their home country of @entity99			0
it said more removals to the three @entity25 nations were expected soon			2
what if @entity5 does n't act ? the @entity113 administration says it will seek ways for homeland security secretary @entity251 to speed up removals under the existing law			1
it has transferred resources from other parts of the immigration system to better handle the surge , with a goal of quicker hearings for the children			0
@entity80 of the @entity82 said faster hearings would resolve cases before the kids get turned over to family or friends in the @entity10 , eliminating a major incentive for coming in the first place			2
use ' safe zones ' to end immigrant crisis @entity1 's @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0

a law to protect migrant kids from sex trafficking causes hearing delays today
the delays *encourage* parents in @entity25 to send their kids north
some in @entity5 propose changing the law to speed up the process
@entity172 leaders say child immigrants must have a full hearing
