-- the same @entity2 administration that is under fire from critics for allegedly leaking classified information has used a 1917 law to target suspected leakers in twice as many cases as all previous presidential administrations combined			1
under @entity2 , the @entity10 has prosecuted six cases under the @entity12 in recent years ; federal prosecutors had used the law in three cases before @entity2 took office			1
" they 've been very tough on these issues , " said @entity17 , senior legal analyst for @entity0			1
" i think @entity21 administrations feel especially obligated to prove that they can be as tough as republicans on law enforcement			1
that was true during @entity25 , and it 's true now , perhaps even excessively			2
" congressional leaders call for halt to ' cascade of leaks ' @entity17 said he believes the prosecutions are " mildly excessive , " but " i think it 's par for the course			1
i think it 's reflective of a very tough law - enforcement culture that spans the parties			1
" in a post- 9/11 world , perhaps administration officials feel the stakes of leaking are higher , he said			1
the issue of leaking classified information has been thrust into the national spotlight this week			2
several leading members of @entity45 argue that the @entity2 administration has not done enough to prevent leaks about a puported cyberwarfare program against @entity49 , the administration 's efforts to expand its drone program and @entity2 's personal involvement in " kill lists " of militants in @entity56 and @entity57			1
some @entity22 , including sen. @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity2 's opponent in the 2008 presidential race , say the @entity61 must be knowingly involved in the recent leaks			1
they allege that the @entity61 has leaked information to paint the president as a strong commander in chief , a sensitive election - year allegation that the @entity61 has strongly denied			2
@entity69 minority leader @entity68 's reaction to @entity58 's accusation the fact that the @entity2 administration has aggressively used the @entity12 surprised people such as @entity73 , director of the @entity74 for the @entity76 - based @entity75			1
he said the uptick in prosecutions was " not what anybody expected			1
" he said he believes there are several reasons why " there 's something new and different going on			2
" " the aggressive pursuit of leaks is extraordinary and unprecedented , " he said			1
" why is it happening ? i think there are probably multiple reasons			2
those include the fact that it is probably easier to identify the source of leaks today than it was a couple of decades ago because there are more tracks of communications -- electronic communications , e-mail and phone records -- that are accessible to investigators than there were in the past			1
" another reason could be a backlash stemming from the " wholesale disclosures of classified information by @entity108 , " he said			1
the disclosures , he noted , " crossed so many different policy boundaries , they shocked and horrified government officials ... the tolerance for such leaks , to the extent there was any before , has gone away			1
" an additional factor is political pressure on the administration from @entity45 to stop the leaks , he said			1
analysts : ' the ship of state always leaks ' " nobody is saying , ' you 're overreacting			1
there are too many prosecutions			1
' that is not the message coming from @entity45 , " @entity73 said			2
" instead , congressional leaders of both parties are saying , ' we want more prosecutions and fewer leaks			1
' " " that is not my position , " he said			0
" i think @entity12 prosecutions are , in most cases , inappropriate responses to the disclosures			2
" passed after @entity142 entered @entity143 , the act is basically the only law prohibiting such leaks , @entity73 said			1
" there are a couple of other lesser statutes that sometimes are invoked , such as misappropriating government property , that are more of a stretch , but there is no law that says you may not disclose any classified information under any circumstances , " he said			2
" and the @entity12 is the closest fit			0
it does n't mean they are being accused of espionage , but this statute is being applied to fit the facts of these cases			0
and the courts have said , when challenged that that 's permissible			0
" however , he said , the prosecutions do n't mean @entity2 has abandoned his pledge to provide the most transparent administration in history			1
" if that seems like a contradiction , it 's only on the surface , " he said			0
" the administration never pledged not to enforce classification rules or to invite defiance of limits on disclosure of classified information			0
" it is true , however , that the law has only been used recently to prosecute low - and mid-level employees			2
" that 's one of the problems with leak prosecution in general , " @entity17 said			0
" high government officials feel no compunction about leaking , and the rare times anyone is prosecuted , it 's usually someone at a low level			2
" " and also , i react to this as a journalist -- an interchange of information and ideas between government and the news media is indispensable to a functioning democracy , and if you start scaring sources with the possibility of years in prison , the loser is not going to be the news media -- it 's going to be the public , " he said			0
@entity61 press secretary @entity205 said thursday that @entity2 " has demonstrated his commitment to transparency through the variety of steps he has taken , unprecedented in @entity142 presidential administration history			1
" but he is also president and commander in chief , and he will not countenance the leaking of classified information that can harm our men and women in uniform , harm @entity142 who work on our national security , harm counterterrorism operations , " @entity205 said			0
@entity73 said the prosecutions of lower - level officials reflect " one of the basic incongruities " in the law			1
" is it only the @entity227 privates and the mid-level bureaucrats who are leaking ? is it never @entity61 officials or senior agency officials ? judging by the government 's prosecution record , you 'd think that senior officials never leak , because they 're never being prosecuted , and we know that 's not true , " he said			0
" what appears to be a pattern of selective prosecution is another aspect of the unfairness of the way these statutes are being enforced			0
" the government , he said , has several tools at its disposal to respond to leaks , including revocation of security clearances , terminations and other administrative penalties and fines			2
" a felony prosecution for disclosure of information to the media ought to be the response in only the most egregious and damning cases , " @entity73 said			0
" instead , it seems to be the first response , even in the mildest or most questionable cases , like that of @entity266			0
" @entity266 , a former @entity267 official , was indicted in 2010 on 10 counts of willful retention of national defense information , obstruction of justice and making false statements			0
prosecutors accused him of leaking information to a reporter			0
but prosecutors decided they could not pursue the charges after a federal judge ruled classified information would have to be presented in open court			0
@entity266 pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of exceeding his authorized use of an agency computer after authorities dropped the most serious charges -- including some under the @entity12 -- against him			0
he was sentenced to a year of probation in july			0
@entity266 's attorneys said the case did not involve " the handling or mishandling of classified information			0
rather , it relates to mr. @entity266 's decision to communicate with a @entity295 reporter about his belief that @entity267 was engaged in waste , fraud and abuse			0
" other cases include that of former @entity305 officer @entity304 , who pleaded not guilty in april to charges he gave classified information to reporters and lied to a @entity305 review board about material in a book he wrote ; and @entity312 , the army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and @entity315 documents while serving in @entity316 , many of which ended up on the @entity108 site			2
also , there 's @entity319 , a former @entity320 contract linguist who pleaded guilty to providing classified documents to the host of an internet blog , who then published information on the blog			0
@entity319 was sentenced to 20 months in prison in 2010			0
@entity73 said he believes authorities should take into account whether the leak resulted in damage			0
" there 's too much passion at work here , too much zeal and not enough judgment , " he said			0
