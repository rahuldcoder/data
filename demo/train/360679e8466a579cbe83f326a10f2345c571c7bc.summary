-- ten years before comic book heroes dominated box office real estate , there was a small - screen superhero named @entity6			1
she did n't have the strength and speed ( or technology , for that matter ) of the caped fantasies that we now see with regularity at the movies , but she did have capabilities that made her heroic in the eyes of teens and adults who craved a young , female character with intelligence , wit and , most of all , confidence			0
created by @entity23 , " @entity6 " was introduced in 2004 , starring @entity24 ( " @entity25 " ) as @entity6 , a high school student living in fictional @entity26 , @entity27 , who went from popular to outcast after the murder of her very wealthy best friend ( played by @entity32 )			1
@entity6 was determined to find out who committed the crime to the point of ostracizing herself , which was n't hard to do after her father was raked over the coals for pinning the murder on the wrong guy			1
fairly typical mystery series stuff , right ? yet the real beauty of the show was never in @entity6 's search or the cases she cracked along the way ; it was in her total embrace of her outsider status and her refusal to be treated differently because of it			1
life could suck , and many unfair things happened to @entity6 and her friends , but she always rebounded with spunk and smarts			2
" other girls on television , like @entity57 ( on ' @entity57 ' ) or ' alias , ' they could literally kick a * * , " creator @entity23 recently said			0
" i felt like @entity6 's superpower could be that she just does n't give a s * * * what people think about her			1
" that attitude has gone a long , long way			0
while " @entity6 " the tv series was a cult hit that wound up canceled after three seasons , those who did watch were so devoted to the character and her multicultural , multiclass beach town that they single - handedly got a film version off the ground via @entity71			2
@entity75 : will ' @entity6 ' be a hit ? for those who never got into the teen drama , the idea of a fan base strong enough to drum up $ 2 million in less than 12 hours to resurrect a tv character was nothing short of insane			1
but that would be underestimating the world @entity23 and his crew created			0
" @entity6 was the best friend i would beg not to go to @entity89 , " @entity24 told @entity87 in a february issue			1
the actress , 33 , reprises her role in the film version , which sees @entity6 returning to @entity26 to solve a murder case that involves her ex-boyfriend @entity94 ( @entity95 )			1
" i feel so much responsibility to the girls that this show affected , " @entity24 went on			1
" there is a role model here that i care about			1
i think when you get that amount of love from a fan base , you would be an a * * hole not to give it back			0
" those who supported reuniting the " @entity6 " team on film -- and it does reunite everyone , from main characters to actors who had guest arcs -- are getting that love returned on march 14 , when " @entity6 " the movie will debut in theaters and as @entity117			1
' @entity6 ' love triangle resolved ? it 's still up in the air whether @entity6 will have better luck as a big - screen hero than she did on tv , and can draw in a larger audience this time around			1
yet even if " @entity6 " does n't find much life at the theaters , @entity23 , @entity24 and company can rest easy knowing they 've already left an indelible mark on pop culture			1
here are five ways they did : 1			0
it featured a smart , young , kick - a * * heroine			0
when " @entity6 " debuted , it arrived in a tv landscape populated by soapy teen dramas like " @entity138 " and " @entity139 , " and reality series like " @entity141			1
" " @entity57 " had staked her last vamp the year before , and the best place to find women who were n't presented as being one - dimensionally focused on looks or their romantic lives -- or damaged and in need of being rescued -- was in prime time , with shows like " @entity152 " ( about a trio of sister witches ) and " @entity155 " ( about a take - no - prisoners international spy )			2
but " @entity6 " was the place to go if you wanted a character who felt like a teen girl you would actually meet in high school , albeit one who had way better one - liners and better time management skills			1
( this was a character with the caseload of a working private investigator who was still dead serious about her homework			0
) fearless , focused and funny , she made individualism look so much better than fitting in			0
it featured a strictly platonic relationship			0
the tv trope of an opposite sex friendship is so well - worn that we know as soon as we see a pair of male and female buds that there will be something more eventually			0
but on " @entity6 , " the plot refreshingly never went there			2
one of @entity6 's closest friends is a guy named @entity184 ( @entity185 ) , a companion whose shoulder she can cry on and whom she would readily help out in a jam , but with whom she 's an equal , not a romantic interest			1
for once , the teens who tuned in were shown that yes , a nonsexual friendship between men and women can work			0
it had a strong father - daughter relationship			0
after " @entity6 " fans kicked in the funds needed to launch a " @entity6 " movie , their collective breath was held until stars like @entity203 were a sure deal			1
as @entity205 , @entity6 's dad , @entity203 was the older , wiser heart of the series			1
he was n't always the best parent but he was a realistic one , and his relationship with @entity6 was the foundation of the show			2
when everything else came crashing down around her , @entity6 always had her dad -- the sort of comforting story that you do n't see in a lot of teen tv , where the parents are often worse off than their kids			2
it proved that teen dramas could thoughtfully deal with tough issues			2
from rape to class tensions , bullying to predatory older men , " @entity6 " had an endless supply of plot lines that would n't be out of place on an after - school special			2
what saved the series was n't its commitment to talking about complex problems but the way in which they were talked about			0
the script brought real issues into a fictional world , and still made them relatable			0
the topic of race , for example , was n't danced around ; it could crop up in a natural exchange between characters			0
the subject of classism was virtually the backbone of the entire series , as much of the plot 's tension revolved around the wealthy kids who came from a rich zip code and the have - nots they shunned			0
it showed that nothing ever really dies in @entity258			0
by industry logic , this show should have fallen to the wayside and enjoyed a life only on fan sites and in dvd sales of its three seasons			0
but thanks to the on - demand era we now live in , where @entity270 can craft an entire series based on what its users want most , " @entity6 " and its fervent fan base have proven that anything can have a second life			2
