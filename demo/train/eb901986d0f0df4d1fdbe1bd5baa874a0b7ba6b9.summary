-- as a child , i looked forward to nothing more than the dazzling @entity4 laser and fireworks show in @entity7 near @entity8 , @entity9			2
it was family tradition to eat a hearty meal at an @entity14 restaurant and then watch the show on the crowded lawn of the park			2
one year , as i struggled to eat my melting ice cream , a man sitting near us taunted , " what planet are y'all from ? " i observed my family , attired in their extravagant @entity14 clothes and scarves from the restaurant party			1
for the first time , i wondered if we really did not belong in @entity29 , celebrating its @entity4			1
i usually hear the friendly version of this question			0
when my parents are asked , " where are you from ? " and answer " @entity9 , " it is not surprising to hear the follow - up , " i mean where are you from ? " after which they will understandingly answer " originally from @entity41			0
" but when the latter question is posed to me , i can only shrug helplessly and repeat , " @entity9			0
" i used to wonder if i was being facetious in offering such a simple answer , but i honestly do n't know what else to say			0
the same is true when i 'm occasionally told to " go back where i came from			2
" i do n't just brush these comments aside , as many immigrants to @entity29 bravely do , but really question my identity by asking myself : where would i possibly call home except @entity9 , where i was born and raised , or @entity51 , where i have been educated ? to put it in perspective , if all of us " went back to where we came from , " meaning the places of our family origin , there would be nobody in @entity29 except for @entity60 , and the rest of us would be in a predicament			1
the popularized " clash of civilizations " thesis would suggest that racial and especially religious elements of my background conflict with my identity as an @entity29			1
many people genuinely believe that you have to fit a certain racial and religious archetype to be a " real @entity29			1
" i am a @entity73 and i am an @entity29			1
my religion teaches me to treat others with dignity and respect , speak the truth , and accept one @entity79 as my creator and sustainer			0
a religious loyalty to @entity79 certainly does n't make anyone less of an @entity29 , or three of the largest religions in the @entity29 would not belong here			1
but sometimes , people assume that @entity73 must also have a specific loyalty to another country that precludes their patriotism to @entity29			1
contrary to this misconception , there is no such concept in @entity93			0
a fair study of @entity93 and @entity29 values would find corroboration , not contradiction			1
while the @entity98 will not ask for my religion , it will ask for my racial background			0
when my parents came decades ago , they were alternately identified as " @entity103 " and even " @entity104 , " since according to @entity105 , @entity101 are @entity104 , although not white like @entity106 and @entity107			0
they were surprised that color was a determinant of their ethnic categorization			0
racial classification has become clearer since then , and i will choose the " @entity14 " option on the @entity115 , an element of my identity that influences my love for rich @entity119 , clothes and literary traditions			0
but i would be a stranger in my parents ' birthplace of @entity41			0
ironically , it took my being an alien in foreign lands to realize just how @entity29 i was			1
in @entity127 i was told , " @entity129 , you want to see everything , just like an @entity29			1
" @entity131 discovered that my odd habit of drinking cold tea came from my @entity9 origins			0
the @entity135 guessed i was @entity29 based on the way i " carried myself			1
" i could n't erase my apparently nasal @entity29 accent from my @entity138 in @entity139			2
@entity41 tell me only an @entity29 can justify four years of liberal arts , as opposed to vocational , education			2
of course , some comments were based on foreign exaggerations of what " @entity29 " means , and some i still do n't really understand			1
but obviously , @entity29 has shaped who i am			2
what was even more significant was that the speakers never saw my religion or ethnic origin in tension with my nationality			0
neither do i. there are three important dimensions in my life -- my religion , my ethnicity and my country -- and they are all at peace .			0

@entity162 and family at july *4th* fireworks when a man said , " what planet are y'all from ? "
@entity162 says if we all " went back to where we came from , " only @entity60 would be left
people *mistakenly* think @entity73 are loyal to another country above @entity29 , she says
born in @entity29 , @entity162 says it took being " in foreign lands to realize just how @entity29 i was "
