the brief @entity68 report monday did n't state the purpose of the visit by @entity69 , the chairman of the @entity74 , a @entity46 nonprofit group that aims to promote education , dialogue and research in the @entity78			0
but @entity48 spokeswoman @entity79 said @entity69 was traveling with other former diplomats on a trip to " build bridges , " and his visit was unrelated to @entity0 's case			1

he was transferred to a hospital last year after his health deteriorated			0
but last week the @entity46 said he had been moved back to a labor camp , a development his family described as " devastating			1
" in the video , @entity0 asks the @entity11 diplomat to tell his family that " i have not lost hope and have not given up anything			1
" but says he is concerned that if his situation is n't resolved soon , it could " drag on " for months longer			0

" it is the second time @entity2 has canceled a planned visit by @entity66			0
@entity122 said that the joint military exercises are " in no way linked to mr. @entity0 's case			1
" @entity2 has been urging the @entity70 not to take part in the drills -- a call that @entity134 and @entity37 have rejected			0
@entity45 said he hoped a visit would break " that cycle of terror and fear and irritation " between the two countries			0
life in the camp in the conversation friday , @entity0 discusses details of his health problems , as well as the minutiae of life in the labor camp			1
he says he is suffering from back pain and neck pain , making the eight hours of manual labor he does each day " very difficult			0
" " i 've been working with my hands a lot , " @entity0 tells the diplomat			2
" my hands all got numb and sore			0
" but he says that he remains " strong mentally and spiritually , and i am trying to stay strong emotionally as well			0
" @entity0 tells the diplomat that he has access to books and television at the camp and that the staff there treat him " very fairly			2
" the tv antenna stopped working for a couple of weeks recently , he says , allowing him to spend " more time with the @entity166 , with the @entity167			0
" " that was actually a pretty good time for me , " @entity0 says			0
@entity11 represents @entity46 interests in @entity2 because the @entity46 has no diplomatic presence in the secretive state			2
" we again call on the ( @entity2 ) to grant @entity0 special amnesty and immediate release as a humanitarian gesture so he may reunite with his family and seek medical care , " @entity122 said sunday			1
" we will continue to work actively to secure mr. @entity0 's release			1

@entity0 's sister says family is " really discouraged " by his move back to a labor camp
