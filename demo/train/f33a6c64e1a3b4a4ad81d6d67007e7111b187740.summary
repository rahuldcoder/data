-- in the absence of any serious @entity4 opposition , @entity1 appears to have decided to run against @entity5 in the 2016 primaries			1
an interview with @entity8 in the @entity9 revealed her frustrations with the over-caution of the @entity12			0
its maxim " do n't do stupid stuff " might display post-bush wisdom , says @entity17 , but it also betrays a lack of a plan : " great nations need organizing principles , and ' do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle , " she said			0
@entity17 would have gone harder into @entity24 , for example , and armed the democratic opposition early on			0
the message is that while @entity5 has somewhat withdrawn @entity29 from global war games , she would like it to take a lead			1
at the time the interview was conducted , poor @entity17 could not have known that events were about to blunt her criticism			0
( a spokesman for @entity17 said tuesday that @entity17 " called president @entity5 to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him , his policies , or his leadership , " according to @entity42			2
) now that @entity29 planes are bombing @entity45 , or @entity45 , forces in northern @entity47 and aid is finally reaching the persecuted religious minorities stranded in the wilderness , @entity5 's defenders could argue that he 's displaying exactly the kind of leadership @entity17 accuses him of lacking			1
yet , her charge still stands			0
consider the wider fate of the @entity57 world in the past six years			1
the @entity58 promised a new era of democracy and better relations with the @entity62			0
few of its revolutions worked , many were betrayed by the foreigners who should 've been friends			0
the @entity29 rather arbitrarily decided to help topple @entity67 in @entity68 , resulting in an anarchic situation today that is being exploited by a mix of @entity72 and warlords			2
the administration was less certain of what it wanted in @entity76 , vacillating between support for the protesters to support for the army -- and a failed experiment in @entity45 democracy gave way to a return of the generals			0
in @entity24 , as @entity17 suggests , the @entity29 watched as @entity85 slaughtered the opposition			2
in @entity88 , it did worse : arms sales from @entity29 rose prior to the regime 's brutal crackdown on protesters			1
and even as @entity94 continues to export its apocalyptic version of fundamentalist @entity72 , the @entity29 government sells it billions of dollars worth of weapons			1
the greatest failure has surely been in @entity47 , because it is the country for which @entity29 bears the greatest responsibility			2
@entity5 's actions over the weekend are necessary and just			1
the world can not tolerate the slaughter of thousands of religious minorities , the collapse of @entity106 or the invasion of the @entity109 homeland			0
so , well done , @entity5 , for sending in the planes			2
but when he was pressed at a press conference on why @entity29 troops were not already in @entity47 and , by implication , why the @entity29 had stood back as the situation deteriorated , the president economized with the truth			1
he insisted that it was " not my decision " to withdraw troops			0
yet he ran for office on quitting @entity47 in 2008 , then celebrated having done so in 2012 , even as -- as @entity119 argues in @entity120 -- @entity47 prime minister @entity121 was prepared to negotiate on maintaining a @entity29 presence			2
" @entity121 was willing to accept a deal with @entity29 forces if it was worth it to him â € ” the problem was that the @entity5 administration wanted a small force so that it could say it had ended the war , " he writes			1
" having a very small @entity29 force was n't worth the domestic political price @entity121 would have to pay for supporting their presence			1
" in short , @entity5 's claim that withdrawal from @entity47 was forced upon him is hard to believe			1
he was elected and re-elected as the anti-iraq war president ( it 's why he deserves some credit for having the courage to return to the country today )			0
@entity17 is right that @entity5 has hung back from action			1
but the very fact that he was elected and then re-elected on a broadly anti-intervention ticket suggests that this is what the people wanted			0
and therein lies the problem with @entity17 's critique			2
foreign policy rarely functions separately from the domestic political context : presidents typically only do what they think they can get away with			1
there was appetite for military adventures after 9/11 ; there is little post-iraq			0
that 's borne out in the polling and by the lack of political support for action in @entity24			0
it 's all very well for @entity17 to talk of high - mindedness in pre-primary season , but she 'll find that does not go down so well in @entity168 in 2014 and probably wo n't be popular in the general election or inside the @entity12			2
had the @entity29 involved itself in the @entity24 conflict , it would have been picking sides in a brutal civil war with few heroes to choose from			2
so how does the @entity29 -- undoubtedly a " great nation " -- handle foreign crises in an age of doubt ? the problem is that no politician , @entity180 or @entity181 , has yet managed to articulate a vision for an @entity29 that does believe in things worth fighting for yet which picks its battles with incredible care			1
@entity5 's presidency has been too reactive , @entity17 is now laying out a plan that sounds a little too proactive			1
what a pity that so few are saying , " the @entity29 is powerful and , because of that , has a responsibility to support democracy where it can			0
but we can not always presume success and history teaches that going it alone comes at a heavy price			0
" or , what would be so wrong about pursuing a strategy that asserts that if the @entity29 can not do much good then it at least will do as little evil as possible -- starting by refusing to provide arms to @entity57 dictators who torture their own people and export terror ? alas , all too often the only choice @entity29 voters are given is between playing the world 's policeman or doing nothing at all			1
@entity211 to be , as @entity212 described himself , " an idealist without illusions			0

@entity216 : @entity1 criticized @entity5 on foreign policy in *magazine* interview
@entity216 : she *'d* have been more *aggressive* . particularly in @entity57 world , her critique has point
he says @entity5 appears to have hung back , but @entity29 did n't want military adventuring
@entity216 : a *candidate* must show @entity29 they know what 's worth fighting for
