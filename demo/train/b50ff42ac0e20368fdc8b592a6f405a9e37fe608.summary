starting next year , the names of religious holidays like @entity2 and @entity3 will no longer appear on the school calendar in @entity5 , @entity6			1
instead of @entity2 break , students will have winter break			0
and when @entity3 rolls around , the calendar will simply state that there will be no school			2
this new calendar wo n't affect the days students have off , and they 'll still be out of class on @entity16 , @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity17 weekend			2
it 's just that the names of religious holidays wo n't appear on the school calendar			1
the county 's @entity21 made this decision tuesday , pointing out that schools do n't close for religious reasons but for secular ones , such as high absenteeism among students and teachers			1
the decision also arrived amid a push from leaders in the @entity34 community to see their faith 's holidays , such as @entity37 , get the same treatment from @entity5 schools as the @entity41 and @entity42 observances			1
though students who need to be absent because of religious reasons do receive excused absences , @entity34 leaders have argued that 's unequal treatment			1
" currently , the thousands of @entity34 staff and students ( within @entity56 ) have to choose between their education and observing their religious practices , " says a statement on the website of the @entity51 , which has been advocating for @entity5 to close school on @entity34 holidays			1
" they either skip school ( an excused absence ) to celebrate eids or they skip their religious observances to attend school			2
many choose to do the latter			0
however , this is not a choice that , for the most part , our @entity41 and @entity42 neighbors face on their high holidays			2
" plus , there 's the question of equality			0
" sometimes i do n't like it because everybody gets their days off and whenever i have celebrations , i do n't get off , " 9 - year - old student @entity75 told @entity77 affiliate @entity76			0
that said , the @entity21 's decision to scrub the school calendar of all religious holiday names is n't what the coalition was hoping to see			1
" by stripping the names @entity2 , @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity3 , they have alienated other communities now , and we are no closer to equality , " @entity87 , a co-chairman of the @entity51 , told the @entity88			2
" it 's a pretty drastic step , and they did it without any public notification			0
" but to board member @entity99 , who also spoke with the @entity88 , " this seems the most equitable option			0
" @entity5 is n't the first district to remove the names of religious holidays from its school calendar ; @entity6 's @entity105 have done something similar			1
one parent in @entity108 , @entity109 , told @entity76 that she disagrees with @entity5 's decision			1
" i believe religion is what holds our nation together , and i think it 's the glue that keeps our society together , whether you 're religious or not , " @entity109 said			0
her son , @entity118 , saw it as an attempt at political correctness			0
" they 're trying to be politically correct so they do n't offend anybody , " he said			0
" but let 's be real here ; they 're going to offend a few people			0

@entity5 will remove names of religious holidays from the school calendar
it was done to *emphasize* that schools close for secular reasons , not religious
the decision was made in light of a push from @entity34 leaders to see their holidays *included*
