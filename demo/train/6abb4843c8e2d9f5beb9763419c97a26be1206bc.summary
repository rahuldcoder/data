@entity13 rushed him to the doctor , who warned that he was dangerously close to having a heart attack			0
" it was the scariest thing in my life , " @entity2 says			1
that experience , combined with the arrival of baby @entity21 , on march 5 , 2011 , finally inspired him to get fit			1
" being around for my only child was something i made a priority , " @entity2 says , his voice warming as he talks about his daughter			1
" @entity2 bought a set of workout clothes and a pair of running shoes and headed to the gym			1
" i remember it like it was yesterday , " the @entity35 , @entity36 , resident says			0
" i was nervous in front of everybody because i was so obese			0
" his first workout included a little bit of everything			0
without a trainer , @entity2 followed his instincts			1
his only rule in the beginning was to sweat			0

she 's altered her eating habits and takes her daughter on daily walks to stay active			1
she 's looking forward to a long life with her future husband			2
@entity2 does n't allow himself full cheat days -- " the fear of messing up and going backward is still there " -- but he does splurge once in a while on some extra chicken wings or a bigger meal than usual			1
there are days when his legs and arms hurt and his bones ache from all the exercise , but he reminds himself that no one else can do the work for him			0
he 's at 194 pounds and wants to reach 180			1
that said , any extra weight loss at this point is simply a bonus to being healthy			2

he loves to go outside and play with his daughter without breathing heavily or sweating excessively			2
he likes not having to worry about going to the doctor or taking medications			0
he 's thrilled that others have been inspired by his story ; a co-worker lost 80 pounds and several family members have lost more than 50			1
" it 's coming from me , " he says , almost in disbelief			2
" you never would have thought i would be a lean guy			0
sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it 's real			0
