-- hours before 22 @entity3 embassies and consulates were to close for a day , president @entity1 met with top security leaders saturday to review the situation that led to the unprecedented move			1
a @entity3 global travel alert remained in place amid fears that @entity11 may launch attacks in the @entity13 , @entity14 and beyond in coming weeks			1
the threat prompted the @entity3 to announce that 22 facilities would be closed on sunday , including in @entity17 , which was a focus of concern			1
@entity1 met saturday with his @entity21 chief of staff , secretary of state @entity22 , secretary of defense @entity23 , as well as the heads of @entity26 , the @entity27 , the @entity28 and @entity29 , the @entity30 and the @entity31			1
on saturday , the security around the @entity3 embassy in @entity17 was even tighter than last year when the embassy was raided by protesters			1
at least 12 tanks were stationed within 500 meters of the building			0
hundreds of additional security forces were deployed , and roads leading to the embassy were closed			1
checkpoints were set up at a distance from the embassy , and trucks were n't allowed to pass anywhere near the main embassy road			0
@entity17 's special forces , the most elite , were seen in small numbers near the embassy , as well			0
meanwhile , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 have said they , too , will close their embassies in the @entity17 capital , @entity56 , on sunday and monday for security reasons			1
no other embassies are affected , they said			2
neither @entity60 nor @entity61 -- which has no embassy in @entity17 -- planned to close any of their embassies			2
the @entity3 embassies closed on sunday -- a day they would normally be open -- stretch across a swath of @entity14 and the @entity13 , from @entity68 to @entity69			1
@entity70 and @entity71 , both majority @entity73 nations , also are affected			0
the @entity3 government 's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in @entity17 and elsewhere in the @entity13 and @entity14 , said @entity3 officials who spoke to @entity0 on condition of not being identified			1
official : @entity83 tightened in @entity17 " the threat appears to be much worse than it has ( been ) in a long time , " said a senior national security official in @entity17 , where the government is " on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come			1
" various @entity92 targets -- not just those tied to the @entity3 -- are under threat , two @entity3 officials said			1
three sources said the @entity3 has information that members of @entity97 are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack			1
one of the sources said such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the @entity73 holy month of @entity105			0
sunday is @entity106 , or the @entity107 , one of the holiest moments on the @entity73 calendar			0
said one @entity3 official : " it all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future			1
" what 's behind timing of terror threat @entity118 , a former @entity3 ambassador to @entity119 , told @entity0 he had never seen embassy closures ordered across such a broad area			1
" there have been incidents where they 've closed down a number of embassies in the @entity13 because the information is not specific enough to say that ' embassy x ' got to be closed as opposed to other embassies , " said @entity118 , who joined the @entity122 in 1977			1
" but i think this , closing all of these embassies in the @entity13 to @entity14 , is in fact unprecedented			0
at least , i did n't see this during my career			0
" ' leave @entity17 now ' @entity3 officials said that , based on intelligence , they were particularly concerned about the @entity136 in @entity17 between saturday and tuesday			2
president @entity1 , amid regular updates on the situation , has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect @entity3			1
a @entity21 official said the president was updated saturday morning by @entity143 , his assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism			2
@entity1 , who departed for @entity147 to play golf , is being updated through the weekend , the official said			2
he praised @entity17 president @entity149 for his country 's efforts following a meeting thursday at the @entity21			0
the @entity50 @entity153 has also warned its citizens against travel to @entity17 , and urged @entity50 nationals to leave as soon as possible			0
" if you do n't leave the country now while commercial carriers are still flying it is extremely unlikely that the @entity50 government will be able to evacuate you or provide consular assistance , " it said			0
photos : attacks on @entity3 diplomatic sites it was unclear whether the apparent plot targets that @entity168 nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly , and why embassies from @entity70 to @entity171 are being closed			1
nor is the expected time of an attack known , which explains why the @entity3 travel alert extends through august			1
" terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests , " the alert states			0
" @entity3 citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure			2
" @entity188 rep. @entity187 , a member of the @entity189 , called the information " the most specific i 've seen			0
" while the principal attention is on the @entity168 , he stressed to @entity0 's @entity192 that " we ca n't rule anything out			0
" " we are focused on the @entity13 , but it 's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace , " @entity187 said			0
22 embassies , consulates ordered closed the @entity199 listed the 22 embassies and consulates that are closed sunday , which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected			1
the 17 affected @entity3 embassies are in @entity71 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity70 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity119 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity171 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity212 , @entity213 , the @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity17			1
the @entity3 @entity136 in @entity216 will be closed as normal sunday			1
see the whole list consulates in @entity119 , @entity213 and the @entity214 are also being shut for the day			0
embassies and consulates in the region typically close or operate with minimal staff on fridays and saturdays			2
the shutdowns could extend beyond sunday , a senior @entity199 official said			2
retired gen. @entity225 -- who until earlier this year was head of @entity227 , responsible for a 20 - country area that includes the @entity13 -- said the decision to close the embassies underscores the reality of the threat and the wisdom of @entity3 policymakers			1
@entity3 embassies have been targeted before in places such as @entity17 , @entity238 and @entity239 , he pointed out			1
moreover , @entity97 is one of the terrorist network 's most active and most destructive branches			0
" we have to remember that we 're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women , children , diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets , " @entity225 told @entity0 on friday			0
referring to the move by @entity3 officials , he said , " they are showing some proactive discretion here , making certain that we do n't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them			2
" meanwhile , @entity259 shuttered for one day its diplomatic mission in @entity70 on saturday			0
questions , concerns after @entity263 @entity21 leaders have been briefed , @entity265 leader @entity264 told reporters , adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided " some understanding of the seriousness of the threat			1
" @entity187 , who has also heard such briefings , applauded the government 's decision to close its diplomatic missions			0
" i give them credit , " the @entity277 said of the @entity1 administration			2
" i think the government is doing exactly the right thing here			0
" such bipartisan agreement in @entity284 comes at a time when politicians are still scrutinizing the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity3 consular compound in @entity263 , @entity171 , which killed four @entity3 , including ambassador @entity289			2
since then , @entity277 have been pressing @entity1 's administration for answers , with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in @entity263 and not doing enough to track down the attackers			2
eight @entity277 lawmakers are asking that incoming fbi director @entity297 brief @entity296 within 30 days about the investigation			0
they say the administration 's inquiry to date has been " simply unacceptable , " according to a draft letter obtained by @entity0			0
earlier this week , vice president @entity302 and senior @entity199 officials went to @entity296 to discuss embassy security			1
@entity302 also briefed congressional leadership , key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns , a source who attended the meeting said			0
another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the @entity263 attack , which created a political firestorm for the administration			0
on thursday , @entity199 spokeswoman @entity317 said the agency was taking the steps out of an abundance of caution			2
@entity0 found embassy attack suspect before @entity28 @entity0 's @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 and @entity336 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity338 in @entity284 .			0
