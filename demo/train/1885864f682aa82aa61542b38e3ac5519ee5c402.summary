-- sorry , @entity1 : support for emergency care patients barely receives a passing grade and needs extra help , according to a new report			1
the @entity7 , a national medical specialty society , issued a " report card " assessing the country 's emergency medical services			1
as a whole , the @entity1 got a measly d - plus			1
" this report card is saying : the nation 's policies are failing to support emergency patients , " @entity14 , president of the @entity7 , said thursday			1
the report does not single out any physicians or hospitals but shows how well states and the federal government are doing in terms of supporting emergency care , said dr. @entity25 , an emergency physician at the @entity26 and board member of the @entity7			1
categories included access to care and disaster preparedness , among others			2
the country 's emergency care environment has actually worsened since 2009 , the last time the organization graded the @entity1 on support for emergency care			1
five years ago , the nation received a c - minus			1
the @entity7 used 136 measures for grading the states			1
the report card rated some categories in 2014 as better than others , nationwide			0
quality and patient safety environment got a c ; so did public health and injury prevention , and disaster preparedness			0
the medical liability environment got a c - minus			1
but access to emergency care scored a dismal d - minus			1
" if i 'm in a car crash and they bring me to hospital that 's not ready for me , my chances of survival are less , " @entity25 said			0
" so you want a state that has that type of trauma system			0
and when you look at patient safety , that 's one of the components of patient safety			0
" medical liability environment affects your ability to access a specialist in an emergency , @entity25 said			2
appropriate physicians may not be available because they are afraid of being on call for patients they do n't know for liability reasons , he said			0
there have also been trends of physicians migrating from states with high - liability insurance premiums to others where it is not such an issue , such as @entity87 , @entity78 said			2
winners and losers by state in a state - by - state breakdown , grading the 50 states and the @entity93 on these parameters , the report card found that the @entity93 leads in emergency care support , with a grade of b - minus			1
@entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 ranked second , third and fourth , respectively , also getting b - minus			1
@entity103 squeezed into fifth place with a c - plus			0
at the bottom of the list : @entity108 got an outright @entity109 @entity110 got a d - minus ; @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 came out with @entity115 access to emergency care was particularly lacking across many states , the report card said			1
in this category , 21 states received an @entity109 at the front of the class in this category , with @entity125 , were the @entity93 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
" you can have the best medicine in the world , but it wo n't matter if people ca n't get to it , " @entity25 said			0
medical liability was good enough in @entity103 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity87 to score those states as , but 10 states got fs			0
three states got as for policies that support patient safety : @entity142 , @entity126 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
but 10 states got @entity145 in this category			0
for public health and injury prevention , @entity147 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity143 and @entity93 got as			2
but 28 states got @entity153			0
disaster preparedness was also a big problem , with nearly half of all states receiving @entity153			0
on the flip side , the @entity93 and @entity158 aced this category			2
supply is down , demand is up the report also highlighted that there were 130 million emergency department visits , or 247 visits per minute , in 2010 , and there were 37.9 million visits related to injury , according to the @entity171 's @entity170 ( @entity172 )			1
from 1995 to 2010 , there was a 34 % increase in emergency department visits , according to @entity171 's data			2
during this same time period , the supply of emergency departments went down by 11 %			0
the number of patients visiting emergency departments is likely to increase as baby boomers age and develop more medical problems			0
and the report projects that with the @entity190 going into effect , millions of people who ca n't find physicians who accept their insurance , and who were added to @entity188 , will also seek emergency care			1
a recent study in @entity193 suggested that @entity188 increases the use of emergency departments			0
" we 'll be asked to do more with less resources , which has the potential to impact emergency patients , " @entity25 said			0
the report card did not include free - standing emergency departments , as they are new entities and need to be better understood , @entity25 said			1
what can be done ? the @entity190 calls for a work force commission to examine shortages of physicians and nurses , and the @entity7 wants to see that funded			2
graduate medical education funding should also be expanded , @entity25 said			0
the physicians group would also like to see enhancements of the @entity211 in @entity93 to help with disaster response			2
improvements have been made since the 2009 report card ; one state started a new trauma system , while another enhanced medical liability laws			1
" we know that in every single category , there was one state that was able to garner an a on this report card , " @entity14 said			0
those are examples for other states unhappy with their grade , he said .			2

the @entity7 graded states
the @entity1 's previous grade was a c - minus in 2009
