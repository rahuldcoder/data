-- this holiday season , shopping for the gamer in your life is easier -- and harder			1
easier because there are so many great choices , you ca n't go wrong			2
harder because , with the release of the new @entity10 console and the launch of the @entity13 handheld console this year , there are so many choices , you wo n't be able to pick			1
check out my handy gift guide to get ideas for each type of gamer on your list : the pc gamer : the computer gamer is probably looking for one thing : more time to play			1
but in case you want to give them something else to distract them , " @entity28 " is an online role - playing game that lets players dive deep into a fantasy world and have an impact with their actions			1
unlike other mmorpgs , there is no monthly subscription fee , making it a great ( one - time ) purchase			2
if they missed the craze this year , pick up " @entity43 " or opt for other also - on - consoles games like " @entity41 " or " @entity42			1
" if it is n't software they need , @entity44 introduced a new @entity48 gaming mouse this year , featuring three profiles , 20 programmable keys and a new sculpted shape to ease fatigue from hours of gaming			1
the serious gamer : the serious gamer is ready to become one with the console and be challenged with action , adventure and good storytelling			1
" @entity65 " offers a play - it - your - way style split between stealth and combat			1
combining that style with a good story , this title will have players diving back in after finishing their first run , just to see how their actions change the story			1
" @entity77 " is less about the story and more about the guns			2
there are tons of weapons to be discovered and used throughout @entity81			2
but pay attention to the dialogue -- lots of laughs among the bloodshed			2
if they already have the game , think about getting the downloadable content offerings to let them continue their experiences			2
" @entity92 : @entity97 " is another selection guaranteed to tap into your gamer 's aggressive side			2
the vehicle combat scenarios are particularly intense			2
if it is mental stimulation they crave , " @entity102 : @entity107 " is a turn - based game that challenges players to plan , think and enact strategies to save the world			0
balancing short - term gains for long - term goals is key to success			0
the casual gamer : the casual gamer wants to drop into and out of games at their leisure			1
" @entity120 " is the flagship title for the new wii u console and brings @entity116 and friends to life in high definition			1
the platforming action is bolder and brighter than ever as the intrepid plumber runs through worlds to save the princess ( once again )			0
combining the two great franchises , " @entity135 " mixes the classic @entity127 tale , dialogue from the @entity130 movies and a dash of blocky fun to create an exciting game for all ages			0
pay particular attention to the funny bits during some of the more dramatic scenes			0
maybe it 's racing they crave ? " @entity148 " puts @entity142 on the track to save the kingdom through a series of races across very non-nascar - sanctioned tracks			0
he and his racing machine can be customized so players can exercise their creativity while fulfilling their need for speed			0
the kid gamer : the kid ( or kid - at - heart ) gamer is looking for fun , excitement and a touch of something extra			0
why not a physical toy that doubles as a gaming piece ? " @entity164 " extends the franchise this year with new collectable figures that connect with gaming consoles to create a sort of video game magic			1
the pieces are interchangeable for different gaming platforms			0
so if you have a @entity175 version of the game , you can still take your figures over to your friend 's house to plan on an @entity180			0
plus , the toys can be enjoyed as action figures away from the consoles			0
tapping into the magic of @entity185 , " @entity187 " transforms your @entity175 into an interactive storytelling machine			0
the first title , " @entity188 , " is based on the @entity185 universe and written by @entity190			0
players control the action , creating spells , fighting battles and becoming part of the story			0
finally , @entity197 is back and has to travel the world to save his sister in the new " @entity197			0
" the puzzle game challenges kids to come up with creative solutions to problems @entity197 faces in his journeys			0
write the word in his magical notebook , and it comes to life on the screen to allow him to progress and find the magic to stop his sister from turning to stone			0
still stuck ? still not sure what to get your gamer ? do n't worry			0
while it might seem like a cop - out to some , gift cards are sure to be a hit with players			1
this will allow them to explore their opportunities for new games , devices or downloadable content			1
many shopping websites offer electronic gift certificates as well			1
gift cards also work well if they have their eye on some new titles coming out in 2013 like " @entity232 , " " @entity233 " or " @entity234			1
" gamers are always looking for the next big thing			1
happy holidays and happy gaming			2
