@entity0 -- dumpster - lined streets and sidewalks strewn with destroyed art hint at the damage @entity7 wreaked on @entity0 's most important art district last week ; but as electricity slowly returns and flood waters recede , the impact of the " super storm " is still uncertain in @entity0 's downtown @entity14 neighborhood			1
" @entity14 is the center of @entity18 for contemporary art , " @entity15 , owner of @entity16 , told @entity1			1
" this is a big cultural loss			0
" the destruction has left the contemporary and modern art world reeling , and as the recovery effort continues the massive creative and monetary toll is rising fast			1
" i would not be surprised if , when it 's all said and done , the damage that is done to our art world will be in the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in unrecoverable work , " gallery owner @entity26 said			1
the storm that broke records -- and hearts what caused so much damage ? when the surge from @entity7 pushed water levels to record highs on monday night , flooding from the @entity40 quickly filled basements and street level facilities that are used primarily for art storage and exhibitions in @entity14			1
in many cases , precautionary sandbags and sealants were washed away easily , and even works that were elevated high on the wall were soaked by morning			0
as the storm subsided , gallery owners and managers returned early on tuesday , but much of the permanent damage had already been done			2
gallery owner @entity54 returned to his building but could n't operate his electric gate because of the power outage			1
from a back window he was able to see boxes on the ground floor that had floated up when flooding in his 1,800 - square - foot basement nearly reached the ceiling			1
" it 's a disaster , pieces are lost forever , " @entity54 said after emerging from his still - soaked basement			2
" we have been saving works over the past three days			0
" storm victims ' latest adversary : @entity71 @entity26 sealed the bottom of the entrance to his space in preparation for the hurricane			0
" my common sense told me that if there was a foot and a half of water standing on 23rd street , the world was about to end , " he said			1
but when @entity26 opened his doors the following day , water trapped in the gallery all night by the sealant came gushing out onto the sidewalk			2
while many returned to find their collections in ruins , some witnessed the wreckage as it unfolded			0
" the surge came in and broke through the door , and knocked me down , " @entity94 , a sculptor who lives above his studio , told @entity1			1
" [ it ] threw me and thousands of pounds of steel , and bronze , and sheets , all the way to the back door			1
" remarkably , @entity94 was able to return to higher ground and wait out the storm			0
from @entity54 's basement to those barely affected , galleries and conservators seem to agree that the priority right now is recovering as much work as possible and keeping it dry			0
" the conservators were here immediately , there are trucks leaving with art constantly to get repaired , " said @entity15 , who estimates millions of dollars in damage to his gallery alone			1
" the mold is kind of our biggest race , so there 's a speed issue			0
" other galleries have had to perform restorations on their own , reaching out to artists and conservators for insight during this crucial time			0
@entity129 , co-owner of @entity130 , gathered as much work as she could and raced uptown to her parents ' home on tuesday , knowing they still had power			0
opinion : @entity7 shouts climate change " i used their apartment for art triage , " @entity141 recounted , " i brought as much there , and we just cracked open all the frames , got everything out so they would just dry			2
" @entity141 is now using the space above her gallery to hold and restore other works			2
to further assist this process , the @entity150 and conservators from the @entity152 , are offering official guidelines and " a free public presentation on recovering wet art and cultural materials , " according to an official release from @entity150			2
despite the chaos , this generally competitive community has worked tirelessly to come together and ease the blow that @entity7 has dealt , providing each other with generators , food and everything in between			0
" this kind of event brings back the human factor to it , " said @entity166 , senior director at the gallery @entity167 of @entity169			2
" these are artists , these are dealers , people put their heart and soul into the art world and they 're moving to save it , and put things back together			1
" how to help this sentiment seems to be echoing through the galleries of the damaged neighborhood , and many have been adamant that @entity14 's art culture will not only recover but maintain its prestigious position within the art world			1
@entity94 , who has worked and held exhibits in the same studio since 1978 , has already insisted that he will repair and refinish all damaged works			0
" i 'm 75 years old , but i feel i 've still got a lot of life in me , my work is still in demand all over the world , " @entity94 said			0
" the thing about the @entity0 gallery community is that it 's an industry full of extremely intelligent , extremely capable people , " gallery owner @entity196 said			1
" so , i really believe that as dire as things are now , we 're going to bounce back			0
