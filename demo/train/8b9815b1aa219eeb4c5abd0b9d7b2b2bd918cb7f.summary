@entity0 -- @entity2 is to blow up a key part of its controversial @entity5 nuclear reactor on friday			1
@entity6 ( right ) , @entity2 's deputy negotiator to six - party talks , crosses the border into @entity9 on june 5			2
the destruction of the plant 's cooling tower is part of an agreement with the @entity15 aimed at denuclearizing the @entity16 in exchange for loosening some restrictions on the highly secretive @entity20 country			1
the @entity2 government has invited news organizations , including @entity1 , to witness the event			0
earlier this year , @entity24 agreed to disable its nuclear reactor and provide a full accounting of its plutonium stockpile , " acknowledge " concerns about its proliferation activities and its uranium enrichment activity , and agree to continue cooperation with a verification process to ensure no further activities are taking place			0
@entity2 has been taking @entity5 's main reactor apart , but imploding the cooling tower is an exceptionally important psychological step given that the highly recognizable shape of the structure is synonymous with nuclear power plants			1
the @entity44 ' nuclear watchdog , the @entity45 , says it would take a year to rebuild if @entity2 decided to go back on its agreement , and that the construction could not be done in secret			1
secretary of state @entity49 defended @entity15 diplomacy toward @entity2 last week , saying the deal with @entity24 made @entity52 and the @entity15 safer			2
speaking at the @entity54 , a conservative @entity0 think tank , @entity53 said that " @entity2 will soon give its declaration of nuclear programs to @entity57			0
" @entity57 is the host of the six - party talks aimed at ending @entity2 's nuclear program , along with @entity61 , @entity9 , @entity62 and the @entity15			1
@entity53 spoke in advance of her upcoming trip to @entity52 where she will be attending a meeting of @entity68 foreign ministers and meeting with her @entity52 counterparts			0
@entity53 said once @entity2 submits its declaration , president @entity70 will notify @entity72 he intends to remove @entity2 from the @entity15 list of state sponsors of terrorism and scrap some sanctions levied against @entity2 because of nuclear concerns			2
but she noted that there would be no practical effect to loosening the restrictions because @entity2 still was under the same sanctions because of other areas of @entity15 law			0
@entity53 said a 45 - day review would then begin to see if @entity2 is telling the truth and living up to its end of the deal struck in the six - party talks			0
" before those actions go into effect , we would continue to assess the level of @entity2 cooperation in helping to verify the accuracy and completeness of its declaration , " she said			0
" and if that cooperation is insufficient , we will respond accordingly			0
" the @entity15 softened its demand that @entity2 publicly admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and to providing @entity101 with nuclear technology , key unanswered questions that have left negotiations stalled for months			2
@entity2 has already handed over about 18,000 documents on its nuclear past to the @entity15 , which the @entity15 says are critical to verify @entity2 's claims			1
@entity53 said that the deal with @entity2 was n't perfect but offered the @entity15 the best chance to learn about @entity2 's nuclear history			1
" we must keep the broader goal in mind : the elimination of @entity2 's nuclear weapons and programs , all of them , " she said			1
" @entity2 has said that it is committed to this goal			0
" @entity53 said that " no final agreement can be concluded " unless the @entity15 verifies @entity2 's claims			1
