-- @entity1 announced a november release date for its next - generation @entity3 on thursday while looking to shore up two key constituencies -- those still puzzling over the console 's " second screen " controller and hardcore gamers who still view the @entity3 as geared toward families and kids			1
the @entity3 will launch in the @entity13 on november 18			1
two configurations will be available : a basic set for $ 299 and a $ 349 " deluxe " edition that will have additional memory , a stand and charger for the @entity21 and the " @entity23 " game			1
at a @entity26 conference , the company also introduced @entity27 , a free tv and movie service that utilizes the @entity3 's handheld controller , with its built - in screen , as a remote control and tablet - of - sorts for additional content			1
@entity1 president @entity35 acknowledged that , while players who have gotten their hands on the new console have enjoyed it , others remain confused			1
" we 've come here today not just to make news , but to give you a better sense for how @entity3 will change the way you play games , how it will connect your gaming friends and how it will change the way you watch television , " he said			2
" the agent of that change is the @entity52 -- a second screen that does not exist anywhere else			0
" the @entity56 's major advance on the company 's top - selling @entity3 console is the @entity21 , which has a 6.2 - inch touchscreen that interacts in various ways with games that are designed for it			1
players can play together , with one person using a tv screen and the other using the game pad , or a single player can get additional content on the @entity52 that enhances the game on the big screen			0
@entity70 : with new titles , @entity1 works to explain @entity3 while it 's not certain how many new titles will be available at launch time , at least 50 games will be available for the @entity76 , @entity35 said			1
and while thursday 's events showcased new titles in venerable @entity1 franchises like " @entity80 , " there was heavy focus on games favored by more hardcore and adult players			2
those titles included " call of duty : @entity87 , " " @entity88 , " " @entity89 " and " @entity90			2
" " the wonderful 101 " and " @entity91 , " both from @entity92 , will be exclusive to the @entity3 the company has trumpeted enhanced video and memory capabilities on the new system as a way to provide an experience that 's at least on par with the rival @entity100 and @entity103 consoles , which are preferred by many diehard gamers			2
@entity106 ceo @entity105 , who attended the event , called the @entity3 " the most capable @entity1 platform ever , especially for the kind of games we make			1
" he touted planned titles like " @entity113 , " " @entity114 " and " @entity115 , " as well as the " 007 " and " @entity117 " games			1
" we 've never been able to achieve this level of realism before on a @entity1 platform , " he said			2
@entity27 brings together a way to stream , watch and record shows and movies from sites like @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , and @entity129			0
@entity130 , it lets users get additional information about shows and share thoughts via sites like @entity136 and @entity137			0
@entity138 , an executive editor at gaming site @entity139 who covers @entity1 , said thursday 's presentation may have been the moment the company finally hammered home the value of the new system			0
" @entity1 's presentation and vision is far more comprehensive and compelling than what they showed at the past two @entity153 , " he said , referring to a summer video game conference			0
he said the price may be slightly more than many had predicted but that the free inclusion of @entity27 , which he called a key selling point , offsets that			0
the presentation made strides with the hardcore gaming crowd , but that key holes remain , he said , notably titles like " @entity164 : @entity169 , " " @entity170 " and " @entity171 " questions still remain about which , if any , of those titles will be coming after the launch period			0
but while reaching out to new audiences may be a focus , @entity1 has sold 630 million gaming consoles since 1983 and @entity138 says that 's a big deal			0
" loyal @entity1 fans will snatch this up like crazy , " he said .			0
