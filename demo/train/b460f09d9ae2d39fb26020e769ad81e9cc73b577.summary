-- last year 's world champion @entity1 has claimed pole position for sunday 's inaugural @entity3 while his successor as @entity6 's top driver , @entity5 , qualified fifth			1
@entity1 will be looking to end a disappointing year for @entity7 with victory in the season finale at the new @entity10 , but even with a win can do no better than hold onto his fifth overall placing in @entity6 's first day - night event			1
the 24 - year - old will start a race from the front of the grid for the 17th time in his career , and the fourth in the last seven races , after setting the fastest time in all three sessions			2
he clocked a best lap of one minute 40.948 seconds as the sun set on saturday evening to head off the @entity26 duo of @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity27 , whose bid to prevent @entity5 clinching the world title ended last time out in @entity31 , timed 1:41.615 while @entity28 recorded 1:41.726			1
" the car is the best it has been all year			0
it was a smooth lap , and it just kept getting better and better , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" the place is just stunning			0
they all said it would be a great event , but it 's mind - blowing			0
it 's a great place to come to , a great country			0
the weather has been great and the people are so respectful and so welcoming			0
i hope we can put on a great show tomorrow			0
" @entity5 's bid to ensure the first all - @entity50 front row since 1995 came to nothing as he was out - qualified by teammate @entity52 for the 10th time this season			1
the @entity31 is expected to be making his final race outing for world champions @entity56 , who are expected to sign @entity58 from @entity59			1
the @entity60 , who announced during the week that he will be leaving the @entity50 team , qualified ninth as @entity65 's @entity64 and @entity67 duo @entity66 and @entity68 took sixth , seventh and eighth places			0
@entity70 , who will be making his final race appearance for @entity72 , finished outside the top - 10 for only the third time this season , and will start in 11th behind @entity76 's @entity75			1
@entity78 's chances of keeping his drive with @entity7 took a blow as he finished 15th after suffering gearbox problems			0
the @entity83 , fastest in friday 's practice sessions , was just ahead of two - time world champion @entity84 , who along with @entity86 teammate @entity85 failed to make it beyond the opening 20 - minute session			2
@entity84 , at least , can look forward to joining @entity72 as @entity70 's replacement , but @entity91 @entity85 faces an uncertain future as he has failed to take his chance since taking over from the sacked @entity94 former world champions @entity72 will prop up the grid as veteran @entity96 again struggled ahead of what could be the final race of his career as he will be the team 's reserve driver next year when the injured @entity101 returns .			2
