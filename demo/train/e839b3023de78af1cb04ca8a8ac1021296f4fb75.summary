-- when it comes to 3d television , i do n't see it			1
the technology that 's supposed to convince me that a 3d image exists when i look at a 2d screen does n't work for me			1
nor does it work for a small but significant percentage of the population -- 4 percent to 10 percent , depending on which expert you ask			1
me , and millions of people like me , are being left behind by content and hardware companies as they move to @entity16			1
i do n't mean to complain			2
it 's not the end of the world			1
flat - viewers , like me , can watch 2d versions of @entity16 content			1
i saw " avatar " in the non- 3d version			1
as a bonus , the theater was nearly empty -- the @entity16 showing down the hall was more crowded			0
plus , we did n't have to wear those dorky glasses			0
of course , we are social beings , and not being able to view @entity16 means that group or family outings to 3d showings are awkward for the flat viewers , who may have to sit through a showing that will cause headaches or just look bad to them			1
but the flat - viewer 's experience with @entity16 imagery can vary			1
while i find viewing 3d imagery uncomfortable , @entity40 , another person at @entity0 who ca n't see @entity16 , saw the 3d version of @entity24 and wore the 3d glasses			1
it looked fine to him , just not @entity16			0
manufacturers are mute at @entity48 this year , the trend toward @entity16 in home television sets was unmissable , but there was no mention by the manufacturers of how this move would affect flat viewers			0
i was curious how the hardware companies , which fight for every point of market share jealously , could cavalierly ignore the large number of us who wo n't like this new direction			0
it 's a lot of market			1
how are they planning to deal with losing it ? oddly , none of the hdtv manufacturing companies i reached out to could provide a direct comment on this topic , but i did talk with people familiar with the industry and with an optometrist who has a vested interest in promoting the growth of @entity16 content viewing			1
@entity76 of the @entity77 and formerly a marketing executive at @entity79 , noted that for all the hype around @entity16 , the television manufacturers are not really investing much in putting products on store shelves , nor are they expecting consumers to pay for it yet			0
adding the capability for televisions to display alternating images for stereoscopic viewing through electronic shutter glasses is not expensive			1
it 's the glasses themselves that are , and only a few 3d - capable sets actually come bundled with them			1
so consumers will be able to soon buy televisions ready for @entity16 without spending much			0
@entity76 , and everyone else i talked to about @entity16 , reminded me that a good 3d tv is also a good @entity100			1
you should be able to turn off the 3d display features and view content designed specifically for @entity16 but in @entity100 : you just show the view for only one eye			1
if the refresh rate of the program is high enough , you should not notice much of a difference in picture quality			0
get your eyes examined from the optometrist 's perspective , the inability to process stereoscopic imagery is , for many people , a treatable condition			1
dr. @entity117 , president of the @entity118 , told me , " you do n't have to be a @entity16 refugee if you get to the root of the problem			0
the majority of stereo - blind people really can be helped			0
" @entity117 says that there are methods to teach people to see in @entity16			0
using graduated methods and physical aids ( lenses ) as " training wheels , " he says , people can eventually learn how to " point both eyes to focus on the same space			1
" it 's like riding a bike			2
once you learn , the training wheels come off and you ca n't imagine not doing it			0
" vision is definitely learned , " he says			0
" that 's what vision training is			2
" the doctor sounded to me suspiciously like a spokesperson for the 3d television manufacturers , or at least a recipient of some marketing dollars from them			2
" it would be nice if they would fund us , " he said			0
but after reminding me that " @entity24 " had already made $ 1 billion in box office receipts , he added , " i do n't think the industry is worried about this			0
" personally , i have no interest in undergoing medical treatment just so i can spend more money on consumer electronics			0
although dr. @entity162 , in a compelling @entity161 article , did make me wonder what my kind is missing			0
and regardless of whether you see in @entity16 or not , the technology is inexorably changing the visual language of movies and television shows			2
when directors create shows for @entity16 , they ca n't rely on cinematic methods viewers are used to in @entity100 for conveying action , depth , and movement			1
hard cuts and swooping camera moves can disorient viewers new to @entity16			0
the new standard of practice is to lock down the camera and move the action around it , instead of the reverse , which is the case in today 's 2d movies			2
good 3d movies today will appear subtly more stately and cinematic than @entity100 shows			1
the future of the 3d feature for all the hype at @entity48 , @entity16 for the next few years is likely to be a " feature " in the new crop of @entity192 , according to @entity193 of the @entity195 site			2
" it 's not black - and - white to color , " @entity193 says			2
" it 's a feature , like internet connectivity and stereo			2
" he also points out that the content is not there yet , and that many consumers have only recently upgraded their tube televisions to hd flat screens			2
for people like me , for whom the world is flat , this feature can not roll out slowly enough			0

they may be left behind by @entity230 and tv makers ' rush to 3d technology
tv makers say users can turn off 3d display features and just view content in @entity100
