prior to the beginning of the sweat lodge ceremony , @entity13 testified , @entity18 members received only about 10 minutes of training			1
@entity13 , who was a participant in a 2007 ceremony , said @entity25 told the group " to expect that anything could happen : there could be throwing up , some people could get delirious ... anything could happen ; it could get a little crazy ... expect it , it was normal			1
" @entity13 also testified they were not told how to help anyone who was unconscious			2
she said she performed @entity50 , despite having no training , on a man who appeared to not be breathing			2
the witness was outside the sweat lodge during the incident			1
" there was no suggestion anything could go wrong , " said @entity13 , who on that day assisted all three people who died			2
eventually , @entity13 testified , a nurse and doctor rendered aid			0
under cross-examination , @entity13 said participants had a choice of whether to have their heads shaved , which they were encouraged to do in order " to let go of their vanity			0

@entity86 , 49 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , died nine days after the ceremony			0
asked by a defense attorney if the wine episode had anything to do with @entity86 's death , @entity13 said , " i believe that her feeling shameful absolutely had everything to do with her dying in that sweat lodge because she was more than that			0
" on friday -- the fourth day of the trial -- a woman testified that @entity25 dismissed her alert about the failing condition of a woman who was one of three people who eventually died			1
speaking in @entity109 in @entity0 , @entity108 said she twice told @entity25 -- the second time more loudly and urgently -- she was worried about @entity86 , whom she had helped support , during a brief break in the ritual			1

the so - called sweat lodge -- which was 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide , and built to accommodate up to 75 people -- was the site of a purification ritual for participants modeled on @entity138 customs			2
