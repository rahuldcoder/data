-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 blasted @entity4 political opponents friday for criticizing his absence from the state during the snowstorm that pounded the @entity8 over the @entity10 holiday			1
he also took a shot at the media for giving what he characterized as excessive attention to the controversy during what is typically a slow news week			0
both @entity1 and lt. gov. @entity18 , first - term @entity19 , were away on vacation during the storm , which dumped up to three feet of snow throughout the region			1
state senate president @entity24 , a @entity25 , briefly took the reins of power sunday , becoming acting governor before declaring a state of emergency			1
some top @entity4 , in turn , questioned why the state legislature had bothered to create an office of lieutenant governor in 2005			1
@entity1 , who returned to @entity2 on thursday , said the state had competent leadership during his absence			1
he said he would not break a long - held promise to his children to bring them to @entity41 over the holiday and noted that @entity43 had made plans months before to take a two - week cruise with her severely ill father			1
" my first and most important responsibility , in my view , is as a husband and a father , " @entity1 said			1
" i think i made that pretty clear to the people of @entity2 when i was running			0
... and i was not going to rescind my child 's @entity10 gift , especially when i was convinced that we had a plan in place			0
" @entity1 also said he had constantly been in touch from @entity61 during the storm			1
" this is not like in the 1800s when , you know , nobody would be able to get me , " he said			0
" believe me , my cell phone was ringing ... much more than i would have preferred it to under normal circumstances when i 'm away on a family vacation			2
" there is " able leadership in the executive branch of this government , ( and ) i was talking to them on a regular basis			2
" " all this carping and craziness " about leaving the state " stranded " is " just partisanship , " @entity1 argued			1
@entity4 critics in the state legislature " took shots ... without knowing the full story			2
" they should " learn this is a responsible government			0
" noting the massive media coverage of the storm , the governor dismissed it as a reflection of " the nature of the time of the year			2
" " all you guys " in the press " would be doing this time of year , absent a disaster , would be retrospectives on what happened in 2010			0
so you got a disaster to fill the week , and so people want to talk about that , " he said			0
@entity1 emphatically declared , however , that he was not bothered by the criticism			1
it " just rolls off my back			0
it 's what i expect , " he concluded			0
" if you 're going to let that kind of stuff bother you in this job , then you 're not going to last very long in it , and i intend to last in it for quite some time			2
