-- there 's no shortage of promising features expected in the next @entity4 : a brand - new @entity6 operating system , a better camera and processor , and possibly even a fingerprint sensor for added security			1
but the latest rumor is the most eye - catching			0
the next @entity4 could also come in gold			1
well , a classy gold - toned hue , anyway			0
according to recent reports in @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity16 's next @entity4 will likely be available with a white face and gold - colored back and edges			1
so far , iphones have only come in silver , black and white , plus an array of colorful " bumper " options following the disclosure of its @entity4 antenna problems			2
the new color was described to @entity18 as an " elegant " gold tone -- " think champagne , not ingot , " the source said			0
if these reports are true , once - rebellious @entity16 may be further embracing its products ' status as symbols of wealth			0
selling a gold - colored iphone could be popular in countries like @entity41 and @entity42 , where @entity16 and @entity43 are fighting it out to be the dominant player in their still - booming smartphone markets			1
@entity42 and @entity41 account for 60 % of the global gold jewelry market , and the demand is growing , according to a recent report from the @entity50			1
" gold is a popular choice in many markets , particularly in @entity57 where @entity16 has a stated goal of growth , so this seems to be a natural move , " said @entity51 , ceo of luxury phone company @entity52 , in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" gold is a colour that is always in demand , whether for jewellery , watches or fashion			1
it is therefore a natural extension to @entity16 's colour palette and something that perhaps nods to the premium end of the mobile phone market where @entity52 is , " he added			1
" gold in colour falls short of using gold as a material , though			0
" gold phones have been used to show power and wealth long before they became mobile or even cordless			0
in 1930 , pope @entity81 received a solid gold rotary telephone inlaid with mother - of - pearl as a gift from the @entity85			0
a @entity85 telecom company later presented @entity88 dictator @entity87 with a gold - plated telephone , an event fictionalized in " @entity91 : part ii. " although many professionals in the @entity85 seem to now own one , the sleek - looking @entity4 remains an expensive status symbol in many places			1
the demand has created a market for counterfeit iphones , and there are entire fake @entity99 in @entity41			1
manufacturers have struggled over the past two decades to make luxury phones a must - have for people who want to flaunt their wealth			0
@entity104 started its @entity52 line in 1998 , producing an array of phones slathered in precious metals and diamonds			1
the company 's most expensive offering was a $ 334,000 gold and black feature phone framed by a diamond , ruby and emerald snake			1
@entity51 says @entity52 customers are typically " affluent , outward - looking global citizens " and entrepreneurs			2
the company 's single biggest market is @entity41			2
instead of building a phone from scratch , luxury retailer @entity124 takes existing blackberrys and iphones and creates new casings for them fashioned from gold , titanium and diamonds			0
a @entity41 businessman commissioned a $ 15 million phone from @entity124			2
the resulting @entity135 is solid gold with 600 diamonds , plus a 26 - carat black diamond for the home button			0
but phones are not watches or sports cars			0
the technology ages fast , and the devices get supplanted by faster , smarter models every year			0
these speedy development cycles mean the big spenders who coughed up thousands for blinged - out phones five years ago are stuck with devices that look good making phone calls but ca n't connect to the @entity151			0
so a gold - colored @entity4 could be a nice option for people who want to own the latest model and still stand out			2
" it seems @entity16 [ is ] doing an anodized finish , which can look like real gold but unpolished like jewelry , " said @entity124 , the luxury gadget maker , in an interview			1
" i think if the @entity16 rumors are true , a gold phone will be beautiful			2
and that 's coming from me , who has made a massive run of them over the years			0

@entity16 's next @entity4 could be available for the first time in a gold color
it is already possible to get a real gold iphone for about $ *35,000*
@entity175 phones may be an *attempt* to appeal customers in @entity42 and @entity41
