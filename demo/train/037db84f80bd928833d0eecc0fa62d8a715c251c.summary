-- when the comedian @entity3 reportedly singled out a woman in his audience and suggested , according to a blog post that recounted the incident , it would be " funny " if she " got raped by , like , five guys , right now , " the online reaction was swift , heated and often split down gender lines			0
many men wanted to explain free speech or heckling etiquette			0
many women ( and virtually all feminists ) said these topics were distractions , at best , from the sheer offensiveness of @entity3 's attack			2
as we at the @entity20 watched hundreds of users comment on our @entity23 post about the incident , we saw the same disconnect			0
quite a few of the women who shared our post said they were doing so in hopes that a husband or boyfriend would " finally understand why i wo n't watch @entity3 's show with him			1
" some even tagged their husbands or boyfriends , to be sure the message would reach its destination			0
in the aggregate , these comments gave us a glimpse into the ongoing , low - grade conflicts between women who have been trying to articulate their discomfort with @entity3 's lazy , cruel and misogynistic humor , and the men who share their lives but just do n't get it			1
at the center of these disagreements is the rape - joke empathy gap			2
the problem is n't a failure of men to see rape as horrific			1
it 's that many of them do not perceive that rape itself lies on the far end of a broad spectrum of ways in which the idea of rape , the invocation of rape or the threat of rape is used to intimidate women or to regulate their behavior			1
when women are told that they should n't drink too much or walk alone at night or wear a revealing top , they are being given a guided tour of the boundaries of acceptable female conduct			2
women are supposed to understand that these boundaries are policed by rapists			2
we cross the line at our own risk			0
and if we are caught , the brutal punishment is one we have earned			0
@entity83 : if you do n't want to hear an edgy joke , do n't listen a comedian who shoots down an audience member who objects to his rape jokes by joking about her being gang - raped on the spot is n't being funny			1
he 's using rape to shut up a woman who crossed a boundary by speaking out of turn			2
@entity3 was free to say what he said , of course			0
but that does n't mean it was n't morally repugnant			0
what about rape jokes with less vicious punch lines ? here is the gray area where the empathy gap thrives best			1
there is absolutely room in both comedy and in feminism for discussions about rape jokes that highlight rape as a social ill vs. those that perpetuate that injustice			1
that 's why we joined with other feminist media critics and activists to produce a @entity121 " supercut " of rape jokes -- some insightful and some far less so			1
still , the presence of rape in women 's lives is too real and pervasive for many to laugh at all the same jokes that many men can			1
it 's not that women never enjoy crude humor -- a lesbian journalist friend recently confided in us her amazement that her wife is a fan of @entity3 's show , if not some of its more brutal misogyny			0
and it 's not that no man knows with terrible certainty what it 's like to be a rape victim -- one in five females and one in 71 males in the @entity150 are the victims of rape , to say nothing of atrocities around the world such as those described in our new report on rape as a weapon of war in @entity162			0
nonetheless , the significant overlap between the gender divide and the rape - joke empathy gap is real , and it seems inevitable when media coverage of rape so often focuses on what a victim should have done differently to try harder not to get raped			2
such shoddy framing creates a fictional image that there 's a certain type of woman who gets raped			0
women know that 's a lie , because they live the truth , but men may never have occasion to question that image , and so when they laugh at rape jokes , they 're laughing at an abstraction that 's all too real for many women			1
@entity3 and all those with the privilege to hold a microphone have a responsibility to shine a light on the reality behind the abstraction -- not to perpetuate it , and certainly not to silence those who bear its burden			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 and @entity196 .			1

@entity195 , @entity196 : men , women seem to disagree on comic 's rape joke
they say many men do n't seem to get the joke reflected *extreme* end of rape *culture*
they say threat of rape used to *define* boundaries for women 's behavior ; joke did this , too
men see rape in jokes as an abstraction , but it 's real for women , *writers* say
