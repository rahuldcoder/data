-- @entity1 has launched a new flagship @entity3 smartphone , the @entity2 , at the @entity4 in @entity5			1
the majority of mobile giants had their announcements before the actual start of the @entity4 -- including @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			0
@entity1 had the last , and perhaps the most glamorous event of the day , held in a huge rounded dome at the top of the @entity16 next to @entity5 , where the main conference is held			0
the @entity2 ( the first in a new line of devices called simply @entity1 ) , unveiled by the company ceo @entity21 , is a 4.7 - inch , quad core @entity24 3 - powered beast in a polycarbonate white shell			2
the device also brings a vastly improved camera experience , called @entity28			0
the camera takes photos quickly -- in 0.7 seconds			1
it has 8 megapixels and uses an f / 2.0 lens , which captures more light than any other @entity1 smartphone camera			1
it also takes great photos in unfavorable light conditions , thanks to the device 's @entity41 algorithm			0
an on - screen comparison with the photos taken with an @entity2 and an @entity45 portrays @entity1 's device as a clear winner , but we 're sure @entity49 will have a word or two to say about that			0
@entity1 is bundling a bunch of extras with the device : 25 gb of free @entity56 - powered storage , beats @entity58 sound ( @entity1 acquired @entity58 in august 2011 ) and a feature called @entity60 , which takes your photos and videos from the smartphone to the tv ( through a special gadget that connects to any tv ) with a three - finger swipe on the smartphone 's screen			2
the company also launched two other @entity1 devices with slightly lower specs -- the @entity74 and the @entity75 all three devices should be hitting the market in the next two months , likely in april			1
