@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge in @entity1 is set to announce whether prime minister @entity4 will face an immediate trial on charges of abuse of power and sex with an underage prostitute			1
prosecutors in @entity0 filed the request for trial last week , setting in motion a five - day clock for judge @entity15 to make a decision			1
she can order the trial to go ahead without the traditional preliminary hearing , as @entity0 chief prosecutor @entity20 requested , or dismiss it , allowing investigations to continue to determine if there is enough evidence for trial			0
she can also refer the case to another jurisdiction , or request one more day to make her decision			0
@entity4 's lawyers have argued that the @entity0 courts do not have jurisdiction -- because of where the alleged crimes were committed -- or the authority to try a prime minister			1
prosecutors are investigating claims that @entity4 paid for sex with nightclub dancer @entity40 , who was 17 at the time of the alleged activity , and later intervened with the police after she was arrested on an unrelated charge			1
@entity4 dismissed the accusations as " groundless " when the prosecution request was filed wednesday , saying the call for a trial was a " farce			1
" there was no abuse of power , he said			2
and he said he was " sorry because these ( allegations ) have offended the dignity of the country			0
they 've thrown mud on the government , on the country and on myself at an international level			0
" thousands of @entity1 took to the streets across the country sunday to protest @entity4 's alleged behavior toward women			1
the largest gathering was in @entity66 , where organizers said 100,000 people gathered , under the slogan , " if not now , when ? " in @entity0 , organizers estimated that 60,000 people gathered			0
protests also took place outside @entity1 , including marches in @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity77			2
sunday 's demonstrations were the biggest anti-berlusconi rallies since the most recent sex scandal broke			2
@entity4 has denied that he has ever paid anyone for sex			1
the protests were organized by women 's groups and publicized by internet			0
the turnout surprised the organizers , who did n't want the demonstrations to be political , though that 's what they became			0
one woman who came with her family to the @entity0 rally told @entity2 that she was " fed up with the way women are portrayed as objects in the @entity1 media			1
the way that young girls are glorified by their looks and youth and then what ? i do n't want my daughter to grow up thinking that that is the only way to be ... that the only thing that matters is to be pretty and show off their legs			0
... we are more than that			0
" in @entity0 , demonstrators had banners that said , " stop the merchandising of women , " and " @entity4 enough			2
" many of the speakers at the @entity0 rally criticized the way @entity4 's sex scandal made @entity1 look , his behavior towards women and his promoting ex-show girls to high government positions			1
protesters said leaked evidence from the investigation show he has little respect for female dignity , the state - run @entity127 news agency reported			0
wiretaps published in the media suggest he surrounded himself at parties at his home with starlets and other women hoping to use their looks to gain positions in politics or at @entity4 's @entity146 tv empire , @entity127 reported			1
the investigation began in december , after @entity4 called police in may , urging them to release @entity149 , nicknamed @entity150 , from jail , where she was being held on theft charges			2
prosecutors say the activity took place from february until may 2010			0
both @entity149 , now 18 , and @entity4 have denied they ever had sex			2
@entity149 said she did not know @entity4 well but that she did receive 7,000 euros ( about $ 9,300 ) from him the first time they met , on @entity161 2010 , because a friend told @entity4 she needed help			0
the young woman 's former roommate told investigators that @entity149 confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier			1
@entity4 's party argued that he believed that @entity150 was @entity171 president @entity170 's niece and the phone call to the police station on her behalf was done to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with @entity171			2
the lower house of @entity1 's @entity176 voted against allowing @entity0 prosecutors to search property belonging to @entity4 as part of the investigation			1
@entity2 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
