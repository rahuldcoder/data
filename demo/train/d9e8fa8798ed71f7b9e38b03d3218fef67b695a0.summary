-- @entity1 returned to the top of @entity3 with a 5 - 0 crushing of crisis club @entity5 on saturday , while @entity7 kept their @entity9 bid on track with a 1 - 0 victory in the derby against @entity13			1
@entity1 went one point clear of @entity15 , who host third - placed @entity18 on sunday , and @entity7 climbed into fourth despite having a man sent off			1
sixth - placed @entity20 could have joined @entity7 on 44 points but suffered a shock 2 - 1 defeat at @entity24 , who moved out of the relegation zone			1
@entity27 were unable to reclaim fourth place after being held 0 - 0 at home by fellow @entity31 hopefuls @entity32 in the late match			1
@entity5 's season went from bad to worse at @entity35 to end a week that saw @entity38 - based businessman @entity37 become the club 's fourth owner in six months ahead of a winding - up hearing due to tax debts next wednesday			2
@entity44 striker @entity43 put @entity1 ahead in the 40th minute with his 23rd league goal this season with a header from @entity49 's cross , then @entity51 's close - range effort was deflected off @entity52 , who was credited with an own - goal , onto goalkeeper @entity54 and into the net just before halftime			0
it was 3 - 0 after 59 minutes as @entity5 's @entity59 deflected a shot by @entity61 past @entity54 , then @entity1 striker @entity57 fired in a low effort three minutes later			1
the visitors then conceded a third own - goal in the 69th minute as @entity65 diverted @entity67 's cross into his own net to leave @entity5 six points adrift of second - bottom @entity70 , who play @entity73 rivals @entity74 on sunday			2
@entity7 played for 55 minutes with 10 men against @entity13 after @entity77 defender @entity76 was sent off for a two - footed tackle on @entity79 , but claimed a vital home victory thanks to @entity82 's 50th goal for the @entity84 club			1
the @entity86 striker headed home @entity88 's corner from close range in the 55th minute , and @entity13 struggled to break down their rivals ' determined defense before also being reduced to 10 men when @entity95 midfielder @entity94 received his second booking in time added on			0
@entity20 welcomed back @entity44 defender @entity98 for his first outing in two months following injury -- and also since tabloid revelations which on friday saw @entity15 's @entity102 stripped of the national captaincy due to an alleged affair he had with his ex-teammate 's former partner			0
but it was @entity24 , who drew 1 - 1 with @entity15 on tuesday , who took the lead in the 31st minute when @entity111 scored his first league goal			1
the @entity114 striker , whose relatives were affected by the @entity117 earthquake , curled in a fine shot after a layoff by fellow frontman @entity120 , whose fellow @entity86 @entity121 made it 2 - 0 nine minutes after halftime with a 25 - yard volley from half - cleared corner			2
@entity126 's @entity24 pulled one back five minutes when @entity127 scored from close range after a corner by @entity130 , but the visitors could not equalize despite bringing on new signing @entity132 for his debut			0
@entity27 could not find a way past @entity32 's veteran @entity137 goalkeeper @entity136 , who pulled off a string of fine saves			2
the hosts appealed in vain for a late penalty when midweek hat - trick hero @entity144 was brought down by @entity32 midfielder @entity145 , then his strike partner @entity146 missed with a back - heeled attempt from close range in time added on			2
@entity150 consolidated 10th place with a 0 - 0 draw at @entity153 , who were left a point above the relegation zone after having a late header by captain @entity158 ruled out for a push on @entity160			1
@entity161 leapfrogged @entity162 into 11th place with a crushing 3 - 0 win over the visitors in manager @entity167 's 300th match in charge of the club			1
goals from full - back @entity171 and striker @entity173 made it 2 - 0 at halftime , then @entity162 defender @entity174 was sent off for a second yellow card before @entity178 wrapped up victory on 67 minutes			0
the match was marred by the news that a man , reportedly a @entity162 fan , was taken to hospital in a critical condition with a head injury after being found unconscious at the start of the second half			0
police are investigating the matter			0
@entity191 remained 13th after coming from behind to draw 1 - 1 with @entity192 , who led through @entity194 before @entity195 headed home on 64 to give manager @entity197 a point against his former club			1
@entity191 , however , have not won in 11 games while @entity192 -- knocked out of the @entity201 by fourth division @entity202 in midweek -- are just two points above the drop zone			0
@entity206 moved out of the bottom three with a 2 - 1 win at home to fellow strugglers @entity209 to give manager @entity210 his first victory since taking charge and the club 's first in 13 league outings			0
loan striker @entity216 opened the scoring before debutant defender @entity218 doubled the lead , while substitute @entity220 pulled one back for @entity209 late on after fellow new signing @entity222 hit the post .			0
