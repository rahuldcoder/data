-- to say i learn new things about @entity3 , @entity4 , every day is not an understatement			1
i am the chief cameraman in @entity0 's @entity3 bureau and have lived in @entity3 since 1996			1
i traveled so much for @entity0 the first few years that i only had a passing knowledge of the city			1
then my wife and i had kids , so my knowledge became limited to mostly child - friendly pursuits			1
but as @entity13 wrote , " you find no man , at all intellectual , who is willing to leave @entity3			1
no , sir , when a man is tired of @entity3 , he is tired of life ; for there is in @entity3 all that life can afford			1
" so i think most people learn something new nearly every day			2
@entity0 asked me these questions about my adopted hometown : where can you get the best view of the city ? it used to be a number of different places , but the @entity33 is now the best place to go , hands down			1
if you can , time it so you are on it as the sun is near to setting , because you just might catch the beautiful orange sunset hitting the clouds , if the weather is just right			2
which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion ? my wife , her family and i recently went to @entity46 , one of @entity48 's restaurants , and it was excellent			1
i would definitely try that one again			2
where is the best place to people watch ? probably @entity52			2
not only can you watch people , but also there are fantastic views 360 degrees around you ! what is your favorite neighborhood ? why ? @entity57			1
it is very green , very suburban , it has a lot of nice restaurants on the high street and like lots of @entity3 , you often see celebrities strolling down the street			2
@entity66 and the artist @entity67 , who designed the @entity70 ' @entity69 album cover , are two i have seen most recently			2
if i were to travel beyond my own area , @entity72 and @entity73 are beautiful and green with lots of nice restaurants around			2
how do tourists stick out and what 's the best way to blend in ? @entity3 is so eclectic and because vast amounts of the people you will see are from somewhere else , it is hard to be tagged as a tourist			1
that said , if you are wearing an " i ( heart ) @entity3 " sweatshirt , a backpack or a baseball cap with a still camera in your hand and are standing on the left - hand side of the escalator at a tube station , you are definitely a tourist ! so avoid all those things and you will probably do well			1
where do you go to relax ? home , on my couch			2
i travel too much for anywhere else to be relaxing			0
other than that , maybe one of the many , many parks around @entity3 with my family			0
what essential thing should visitors see / experience if they only have a few hours ? you ca n't do @entity3 in a few hours			0
if you have truly never been here before , the best thing to do is to get on a hop - on , hop - off open - top double - decker tourist bus to see the highlights and stop at what strikes your fancy			1
i would say walking from @entity52 down @entity117 past @entity118 to the @entity119 and then @entity120 is a must			0
but the @entity122 is worth your time as well			0
you should spend all your time outside , but if it is raining , the museums in @entity3 are superior , generally free and a great way to pass several hours			0
what 's the biggest tourist trap ? is there a " tourist trap " that 's actually worth seeing ? probably the biggest tourist trap is @entity131			1
it is fun to be photographed with the wax figures , but once you have been there one time , that is usually enough , at least for me			0
but it is worth going to once			0
@entity140 is the other tourist place i am not sure i need to ever visit again			0
fun and frightening once , but not necessary beyond that			0
what is a good local souvenir ? that is very hard to say , as everyone wants something different			1
i recently took a friend visiting around and she was looking for @entity3 snow globes			0
we found some in a souvenir shop after a long search			0
where was your most memorable meal ? @entity158 in @entity159 at a restaurant named drones			1
it has since closed , but i lived over it for a few months when i first got to @entity3			0
it is where i proposed to my wife , and that would be my most memorable meal			0
are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try ? probably one of the oddly named dishes like @entity175 ( sausages baked in @entity178 pudding batter ) or @entity179 ( a classic @entity4 pudding ) would be most appropriate , if only to take pictures of it and tell your friends back home			0
barring that , i would suggest the @entity187 comfort food of mash and pie and a pint			0
the food in @entity3 is great , but there are some bad places to go , so do n't let one bad meal make you slur the whole city .			1

the @entity33 offers the best views of the city , @entity0 cameraman says
@entity48 's restaurant @entity46 is excellent for a special occasion
double - decker bus tours are a good way to get an *overview* of the city
