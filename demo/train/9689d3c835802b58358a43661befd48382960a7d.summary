@entity0 -- family , friends , colleagues and fans have been paying tribute to the author , archaeologist and former @entity1 journalist @entity9 , who has died suddenly			1
@entity9 , who lived in @entity0 with his wife @entity10 and their two children , @entity13 and @entity14 , had just completed the fourth in a series of novels , based around the exploits of a gritty detective from @entity20 , which had been translated into 33 languages and sold two million copies			1
on his @entity24 page he described his feelings over its forthcoming publication : " first proof copy of ' @entity28 ' arrived with the postman this morning			2
curiously i am more excited about this one than any of my previous novels ! " his wife , a documentary maker , on sunday announced @entity9 's death from a ruptured aneurysm , adding : " he was a truly unique person - a brilliant @entity34 and adored husband			1
we will all miss him so , so much xxx			0
" @entity9 , who was born in 1968 , lived an extraordinary life , as he was the first to admit			1
" with a father who sold ladies ' underwear for a living , and an actress - turned - psychoanalyst for a mother , i suspect my life was never destined to follow a wholly conventional path			2
" on his website he described how after graduating with a history degree from @entity49 which he represented at boxing , he almost entered @entity53 's @entity52 spy service , then worked as a gravedigger in @entity55 , sold cigars in @entity57 's and toured @entity58 acting as @entity59 in a " ground - breakingly execrable production of ' @entity61			1
' " on his return to @entity0 , @entity9 worked in the advertising department of the @entity64 , a magazine and charity founded to help homeless people			1
soon he was lobbying the magazine 's founder and editor - in - chief @entity69 to work as a writer			0
" @entity9 wrote some stuff for us , and it was spell - binding , " @entity69 told @entity1			1
" i do n't remember anyone doing it like he did			0
he was just a born writer			0
" @entity64 was floundering during its first year , and it was only when people like @entity9 came along in 1992 that we got a reputation for good journalism			1
he could just do anything			0
" @entity69 recalled how @entity9 's quick wit and warmth relieved the serious atmosphere at the magazine			1
" my world was full of earnest people so to meet @entity9 was so refreshing , " he said			1
" he had an electric sense of humor and seemed to be here to tell funny stories			0
he also had a surprising calm : he seemed supremely confident of his abilities , but never bragged or boasted			0
" @entity9 was always up for a challenge			1
when @entity64 colleagues pointed out his physical resemblance to princess @entity97 's boyfriend @entity96 , he agreed to be photographed for a feature in which he posed in character around @entity0			0
unfortunately , the magazine appeared on the streets the day after the death of @entity97 and @entity96 in a car crash			0
colleagues @entity104 and @entity106 remembered fondly that " the monday was taken up with staff frantically sticking apologies into every single copy of the magazine			0
" @entity9 later worked for other publications including @entity1 , where he wrote features as well as vivid reportage			1
in 2001 he covered the chaotic funeral of @entity115 leader @entity114 in @entity117 's @entity116 when @entity119 troops fired tear gas at a group of @entity115 youths			0
" at one point i tried to take a picture of a young boy attacking a camera , " @entity9 wrote			1
" immediately i was surrounded by a crowd of teenagers shouting ' no photo ! ' one raised his fist at me and shouted ' i @entity131 ! you understand ! ' " as soon as i explained i was @entity135 , however , and not an @entity119 , their anger dissipated			0
the one who had raised his fist at me apologized meekly			0
" @entity138 's vice president , @entity137 , described how @entity9 's enthusiasm inspired his colleagues			2
" @entity9 was a terrific person to work with			2
as well as being an outstanding journalist , he was always cheerful , always helpful			2
" his natural enthusiasm lifted our spirits			0
he made us laugh , he made us think and he cared about people			0
@entity9 was also the master of playing down his own achievements , be it his boxing exploits , his archaeological knowledge or the fact that he became a very successful author			1
if you congratulated him , he 'd say thanks , smile , shrug and ask about you instead			0
" alongside his journalism , @entity9 also worked extensively as a field archaeologist , particularly in @entity158 where he took part in the first expedition to dig new ground in the @entity162 since the discovery of @entity164 in 1922			1
@entity9 described how he had " the dubious honor of having discovered the only items of pharaonic jewellery to have been found in the @entity162 since @entity164			2
" his archaeological knowledge , along with his unique way with words inevitably led to him writing his best - selling novels , and he was proud to be described by the independent newspaper as " the intelligent reader 's answer to ' the @entity175			2
' " despite his success he remained down - to - earth and accessible though			0
@entity178 was just one of many fans who posted tributes on @entity9 's @entity24 page : " @entity9 was an amazing author as everyone has already said			1
he always took time to respond to his fans often with a wicked sense of humour ! he will be sorely missed both my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed his books and send our deepest condolences			2
