a new deadline for a political framework agreement for @entity5 's nuclear talks has been set for march 1 , 2015 , a @entity1 diplomat tells @entity6 on monday , with a deadline for final agreement including annexes on july 1			1
negotiators had been scrambling to reach a deal on @entity5 's nuclear program before a monday night deadline			1
the negotiators included representatives from @entity5 and the p5 +1 countries -- the five permanent members of the @entity18 ( the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 ) , plus @entity24			2
the parties involved will release a statement monday citing " good progress " from their talks in @entity29 , a @entity1 diplomat told @entity6			2
the negotiations will reconvene at a lower level -- below the level of foreign ministers -- in the coming weeks			0
a deal could have brought an end to significant sanctions against @entity38 and a warming of relations with the @entity41			1
the absence of a deal could ramp up tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- and even confrontation -- over @entity5 's controversial nuclear program			2
@entity5 insists that like other countries , it has a right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes			0
but western powers have accused @entity5 of trying to develop nuclear weapons as well			2
and the head of the @entity55 , who was not part of the @entity29 talks , said last week that @entity5 authorities continue denying his agency access to a sensitive military complex suspected of being a site of nuclear activities			0
major disagreement one of the primary sticking points in this round of talks has been how to lift sanctions against @entity5			1
hardliners in @entity5 have insisted that significant sanctions be lifted right away as a sign of good faith from the @entity74 +1 countries			1
such penalties , including banking and energy sanctions , would affect tens of billions of dollars			0
earlier this month , 200 @entity5 members of parliament signed a statement demanding that @entity5 negotiators " vigorously defend " the country 's nuclear rights and ensure a " total lifting of sanctions			1
" international nuclear watchdog : @entity5 needs to cooperate but p5 +1 members have said they 'd prefer to lift the sanctions incrementally so they can have leverage on @entity5 and to make sure @entity38 makes good on its commitments to whatever deal is reached			1
media in @entity38 were skeptical about a resolution before the monday night deadline			1
reaching a deal by the deadline " would be impossible " based on the differences that remain between negotiators , the @entity95 reported sunday , citing an unidentified @entity5 official involved in the talks			1
before monday 's extension of talks , a @entity103 official said negotiators had been " chipping away " at the issues			0
" the focus of discussions remains on an agreement , but we are discussing both internally and with our partners a range of options for the best path forward , " the official said			0
this is n't the first time negotiations over @entity5 's nuclear program have been extended			0
the previous deadline had been pushed back four months , to this round of talks			0
pressure on both sides both @entity5 and @entity19 officials will face a difficult political environment at home as they return without a deal			2
@entity19 president @entity128 and @entity5 president @entity129 have faced domestic political pressure to strike a deal			2
an extension could sharpen opposition both in the @entity19 and in @entity5			0
in the @entity19 , @entity134 will control the @entity135 in january , and lawmakers have threatened fresh sanctions on @entity5 if a deal is not reached			1
although @entity128 has the power to veto , just the prospect of additional sanctions could drive @entity5 away from the table			0
will @entity143 kill an @entity5 nuclear deal ? @entity128 has said that if an agreement is reached , he thinks he can get the approval of @entity143 and @entity19 at large			0
" i 'm confident that if we reach a deal that is verifiable and assures that @entity5 does not have breakout capacity , that not only can i persuade @entity143 , but i can persuade the @entity19 people that it 's the right thing to do , " he said in an interview aired sunday on @entity150 's " @entity149			1
" but the senior @entity103 official told @entity6 on sunday that the @entity5 " still have big decisions that need to be made			0
