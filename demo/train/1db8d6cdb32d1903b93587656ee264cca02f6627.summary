in parental torment over what became of his son and 42 other missing @entity5 students , @entity0 rejects official accounts they apparently were massacred			1
he hopes that somehow his son and the others are still alive			1
" i think they have him arrested or locked up			0
i do n't know where he is , but if i knew , i would go get him , " @entity0 said of @entity12 , 19 , his namesake son with a different spelling			1
" i want him to know that i love him , " he added , beginning to weep			2
" i want him alive			2
" anguish overwhelms @entity0 and grows daily , ever since the aspiring primary school teachers disappeared september 26 in a violent clash with police during a political protest that also left six people dead , including three other students			1
the mass disappearance is so haunting that @entity0 ca n't believe it befell his son			1
the father has n't seen @entity12 in eight years , since migrating to @entity31 to find work and send money to his wife and their four sons back in @entity5 , but the memory of him burns vividly			1
the 43 missing students went missing after they had been captured by police in the city of @entity41 , in @entity43 state			1
they allegedly were turned over to a gang in cartel territory and then executed in a dumpster in @entity47 , 14 miles away			0
the gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river , authorities say			0
fighting a " monster " like many other parents and their supporters , @entity0 excoriates @entity5 officials in the same breath that he asserts his son is alive			1
" i do n't lose faith , but we have fought and fought this monster in front of us , and we ca n't get ahead , " said @entity0 , 66 , a handyman who lives in @entity56 and is believed to be the only @entity58 - based parent of any of the 43 students			1
the " monster " is the @entity5 government , @entity0 says			1
he does n't believe what authorities say about the students having been tortured and killed			2
the story is a way for @entity5 authorities to push the case aside and move on , he says			1
the 43 students were mostly men in their 20s from a college outside @entity41 devoted to helping poor , rural schools			1
so far , authorities have charged @entity41 mayor @entity76 as the " probable mastermind " in the 43 students ' disappearance , and he has been charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide , authorities said			2
in all , at least 74 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances and the deaths , and the governor of @entity43 has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what 's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent @entity94			0
@entity0 is n't satisfied with those arrests			2
" i ca n't tell you that our government is n't doing anything			0
they say one thing and then promise another			0
they say they are going to do something , and they deviate and they do n't do anything , " @entity0 said			2
uproar at highest places the inability of authorities to locate the 43 students or their bodies is an open wound on the psyche of the 43 families and @entity5 society			1
the case is being compared by human rights activists to @entity121 's @entity120 massacre on the eve of the @entity123 there , in which police are alleged to have killed as many as 300 student demonstrators calling for greater democracy in what was then a one - party system			0
the current public uproar has touched the highest political and religious institutions in @entity5			1
at the holiest of shrines devoted to @entity5 's patron saint , some parents prayed to the @entity135 at the @entity136 in @entity121 , chanting " alive they were taken , alive we want them returned			1
" " we have come here so that the @entity135 will give us a miracle , to give us a hand , so that my son and the others will appear , " @entity139 , father of missing @entity140 , told @entity141 at the @entity136 in october			2
then , demonstrators spray - painted and tried to burn a door to the @entity148 , or @entity149 , in @entity121 's central square in unsuccessful effort to breach it			0
on november 20 , a national caravan of protesters will converge on @entity121 , led by some of the families of the missing 43 people and other students from @entity158 , a small college devoted to training students to become teachers			1
parents ' demands the parents even met with president @entity165 in his @entity167 residence about the police search for the missing 43 people and declared the government 's results insufficient			1
" as parents , as students , as lawyers , we believe that these commitments are not enough , " said @entity172 , father of missing @entity173			1
" there are no results for us			0
the results for us will be significant the moment that they hand over all of our missing children			0
" the parents want a team of @entity186 specialists to review the investigation , and they want the @entity5 president to sign an agreement with the @entity190 to participate in the probe , according to the parents ' attorney , @entity192			1
" today there is no irrefutable proof , there remains lines of investigations , there are several people who need to be arrested , there are several statements that could change the course of the investigation , " @entity192 said			0
" parents are not going to accept the hypothesis before us			0
it is not a conclusive , final investigation			0
the investigation needs to be open , so that there will be the full truth that the parents are fighting for			0
we make several petitions that we find this truth , " @entity192 said			0
other missing people cases the alleged massacre of the 43 students has now prompted other families to renew attention on long unsolved cases of missing relatives and migrants in @entity5			1
@entity5 's @entity223 counts 22,322 missing people since 2006 , excluding the 43 students			1
the country 's @entity225 says 3,000 migrants from @entity228 have also gone missing in @entity5 since 2010			1
@entity229 has been wondering for 23 years what became of her son when he traveled from his native @entity232 to @entity5 in attempt to reach the @entity58			1
" twenty - three years that i have n't been to give him a hug on his birthday , 23 years that i have n't been able to my son @entity240 , " @entity139 said of her son , @entity234 , who would now be age 47			2
she criticized the @entity5 government for failing to solve the case			2
she gave a dna sample of her son to authorities a decade ago			0
" it does n't matter what country we 're in , what nationality we are , pain is pain , " said @entity139 , a retiree who lives in an @entity246 apartment filled with photos of her missing son			2

@entity0 's last contact with his son was a phone call just eight days before he and other students traveled in buses to @entity41 to protest a speech by the mayor 's wife , @entity274 , who along with her husband are known as " the imperial couple			1
" a history of antagonism exists between @entity41 's elite and the students of @entity282 , who were involved in a violent protest last year			2
the students are portrayed by @entity41 's business and political leaders as rabble - rousers , one @entity5 analyst said			1
" the young students who are studying to be teachers of farmers have been stigmatized			0
they have been presented as vandals , people who cause problems , " @entity292 , editor of @entity293 , one of @entity5 's major newspapers , told @entity296 en @entity297			2
the rural teachers ' colleges , sometimes called normal schools , are called " devil schools " by critics , @entity300 said			0
" these are schools that are poor , and for the poor , to teach the poor , " @entity300 said			0
the schools have been in the government 's cross hairs , and business groups have requested they be closed , he added			0
" these schools are the gateway to move socially for the poor , rural students , " @entity300 said , " and they are one of the few escape routes that farmers have for their children to become teachers and prosper			0
" a father 's pride whatever antipathy existed against the students , nothing could excuse this , @entity300 said			0
" they did this because they knew they could , " @entity300 said , " and they do n't think there will be consequences			0
