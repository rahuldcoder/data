the @entity1 magazine is running a bombshell story alleging that the @entity3 knew all along that @entity4 was living for years in his longtime hiding place in the northern @entity3 city of @entity7 , where he was killed by a @entity10 navy seal team on may 2 , 2011			1
the @entity1 story , titled " what @entity3 knew about @entity4 , " will carry weight : it was written by @entity15 , the dean of the correspondents who have covered @entity17 and @entity3 since that fateful day in 2001 , when @entity19 's four hijacked planes crashed through @entity10 's comfortable sense that vast oceans insulated it from its enemies			1
at great personal risk @entity15 has authoritatively covered the war in @entity17 for the past 12 years			0
indeed , i first met her during the civil war in @entity17 during the mid- 1990s when she was an aid worker , and i have met her many times since			0
i encouraged her ( along with , i 'm sure , many others ) to write a book about her reporting in @entity17 , as no @entity32 reporter has more to say about what has transpired there since the fall of the @entity36			0
the @entity4 story in the @entity1 magazine is an extract from @entity15 's forthcoming book , " the wrong enemy : @entity10 in @entity17 , 2001 - 2014			1
" @entity15 makes two astonishing claims in her @entity1 magazine piece			2
the first claim : an unnamed @entity3 official told her , based on what he had in turn heard from an unnamed senior @entity10 official that " the @entity10 had direct evidence that the @entity50 chief , lt. gen. @entity49 , knew of @entity4 's presence in @entity7			1
" @entity50 is @entity3 's powerful military intelligence agency			2
the second claim : " the @entity50 actually ran a special desk assigned to handle @entity4			0
it was operated independently , led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior			0
he handled only one person : @entity4 ... the top military bosses knew about it , i was told			0
" it is , of course , hard to prove negatives , but having spent around a year reporting intensively on the hunt for @entity19 's leader for my 2012 book " @entity68 : the ten - year search for @entity4 from 9/11 to @entity7 , " i am convinced that there is no evidence that anyone in the @entity3 government , military or intelligence agencies knowingly sheltered @entity4			1
how did i arrive at this conclusion ? on three reporting trips to @entity3 i spoke to senior officials in @entity3 's military and intelligence service			2
they all denied that they had secretly harbored @entity4			0
ok , you are thinking : " but they would say that , would n't they ? " well , what about the dozens of officials i spoke to in the @entity10 intelligence community , @entity88 , @entity88 and the @entity89 who also told me versions of " the @entity3 had no idea that @entity4 was hiding in @entity7 " ? during the course of reporting for my book i spoke on the record to , among others , @entity97 , now the @entity99 director and then president @entity101 's top counterterrorism adviser ; then cia director @entity102 and his chief of staff , @entity104 ; then secretary of state @entity105 ; then @entity106 , adm. @entity107 ; then vice chairman of the joint chiefs , gen. @entity109 ; then director of the @entity111 , @entity112 ; then senior director for counterterrorism at the @entity115 , @entity116 ; then head of policy at the @entity88 , @entity117 ; @entity119 , who was then the civilian overseer of special operations at the @entity88 ; @entity122 , who is now the deputy national security adviser ; and @entity123 , who held that position before @entity125			1
these officials have collectively spent many decades working to destroy @entity19 , and many are deeply suspicious of @entity3 for its continuing support for elements of the @entity36			0
but all of them told me in one form or another that @entity3 officials had no clue that @entity4 was living in @entity7			2
indeed , an early debate between senior national security officials at the @entity89 , once @entity99 intelligence established that @entity4 could be hiding in @entity7 , was whether to mount a joint @entity10 - @entity3 raid on @entity4 's suspected hideout			1
this plan was rejected because the officials were concerned that such a joint operation carried the risk that word would leak out about the @entity4 intelligence			0
this debate would have been moot if the @entity3 already knew @entity4 was living in @entity7			1
and , by the way , if the @entity10 government had any evidence that the @entity3 were knowingly sheltering @entity4 , as @entity15 claims , why cover this up ? in 2011 , the relationship between the @entity10 and @entity3 was at its lowest point ever			1
early that year a @entity99 contractor killed two @entity3 in broad daylight in the city of @entity158 , and both countries were trading accusations about each other 's perfidy			0
the tension was compounded by the fact that the @entity99 drone program in @entity3 was then at its height , which was deeply unpopular among @entity3			0
what did @entity10 officials have to lose by saying that @entity4 was being protected by the @entity3 if it were true ? the fact is that the senior @entity3 officials @entity15 alleges were harboring @entity4 were utterly surprised that @entity19 's leader was living in @entity7			1
based on the bewildered reactions of top @entity3 officials to the events on the night that @entity4 was killed , it was obvious to @entity10 ambassador to @entity3 @entity178 and to @entity10 officials monitoring communications in @entity3 that the @entity3 had not had a clue about @entity4 's presence there			1
finally , in the course of reporting my book i discovered that @entity4 was even hiding from some of the people living in his own compound ; forget about letting officials in the @entity3 government in on the secret			2
one of the wives of the bodyguards protecting @entity4 did n't know that the tall stranger hiding on the compound was @entity19 's leader			0
in fairness to @entity15 , i have heard from four current and former @entity10 intelligence and military officials that some of the thousands of documents that @entity200 picked up at @entity4 's @entity7 compound that have n't been publicly released could point to some kind of official @entity3 collusion			1
if that is the case , the @entity101 @entity89 should release any documents that are relevant so that the @entity10 public can be the judge if one of our allies was knowingly harboring @entity4 all along			2
so far there is no evidence that that is the case .			0

@entity213 : @entity1 *article* says @entity3 knew @entity4 was hiding in @entity7
he says reporter @entity15 is a respected authority , but there 's no evidence
@entity220 : why would many high - level @entity10 intelligence officials deny @entity3 's *knowledge* ?
@entity220 : if @entity101 administration has *information* showing @entity3 knew , it must release it
