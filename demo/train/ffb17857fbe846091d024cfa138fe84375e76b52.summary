-- breakaway conservative members of the @entity2 in the @entity3 and its @entity5 counterpart are expected to formally announce wednesday the formation of a rival @entity7			1
the consecration of rev. @entity9 as bishop of @entity11 left many conservatives disaffected			1
leaders of the @entity14 , a network of more than 100,000 @entity17 @entity16 in @entity18 , are expected to unveil a draft constitution for a new ecclesiastical territorial division , or province , at an evening service in @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , the group said in a written statement			1
" the public release of our draft constitution is an important concrete step toward the goal of a biblical , missionary and united @entity14 , " bishop @entity28 of the @entity29 , @entity30 , diocese , said in the written statement			0
the move comes after years of debate over issues from the interpretation of the @entity42 to homosexuality			2
tensions reached a boiling point in 2003 , when the @entity2 consecrated an openly gay man , rev. @entity9 , as bishop of @entity11			1
the move outraged worshippers with traditionalist tendencies , and since then , four dioceses and several parishes have left the @entity52 , including @entity28 's @entity29 diocese			1
in all , the newly formed division will consist of about 100,000 members from the secessionist dioceses and parishes , along with splinter groups that had left the @entity52 in earlier years , said @entity59 , a spokesman for the group " this constitution brings them back together under one church , all aligned together , " @entity59 said			1
" this is all these folks coming back together			0
" @entity67 said it was safe to say @entity28 will lead the nascent province			0
an assembly is likely to be called next year to determine additional leadership , he said			0
the rev. dr. @entity72 , canon to the presiding bishop of the @entity2 , @entity75 , issued a statement saying it would not hazard a guess as to the consequences of wednesday 's service			1
" we will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting , but simply continue to be clear that the @entity2 , along with the @entity83 and the @entity84 , comprise the official , recognized presence of the @entity87 in @entity18 , " he said			2
" we reiterate what has been true of @entity89 for centuries : that there is room within the @entity2 for people with different views , and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in @entity99			2
" the @entity2 is part of the @entity87 , which is composed of 38 provinces around the world			0
it was not immediately clear which of the other provinces would recognize the @entity14 , but @entity59 said in a meeting last year in @entity105 indicated that some would do so			0
@entity59 said the draft constitution will state the province 's core beliefs and doctrine			0
he said it will not lay out definite policies for issues the leaders disagree on , such as ordaining women .			0
