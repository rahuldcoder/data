-- " i mean , i hate to gloat , " @entity2 said , " but i 'm extremely satisfied with my position in life and the way things have worked out for me			1
" for over a quarter of a century , @entity2 has made a career out of his two passions : music and comedy			1
his parodies and satirical songs and videos have amassed an army of devoted fans -- 2 million of them follow him on @entity17			0
he 's won three @entity18 and has sold more comedy albums than any other artist in history			2
not bad for a nerd out of @entity23 , @entity24			0
and now , the @entity26 - shirt - wearing , accordion - playing , curly - haired pop satirist can also call himself a children 's book author			1
on tuesday , @entity2 's book , " @entity30 , " lands on shelves			1
the book , published by @entity33 , brings @entity2 's signature brand of nerdy humor to what turns out to be a very sweet and empowering children 's picture book			1
it centers on what @entity40 , an energetic 8 - year - old , imagines he might be when he grows up			1
sure , it seems like writing children 's books is becoming a popular pastime for attention - loving celebrities			1
but @entity2 found inspiration in , of all things , his father 's career advice			1
" as my father used to tell me , the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy , " @entity2 said			2
and what made him happy turned out to be a career that , @entity2 admits , no one in his family ever thought would go in the direction it has			1
" one of the reasons i was inspired to write this book was because my career path was sort of circuitous , " he said			2
" i went to college and got a degree in architecture , because when i was 12 years old i had a guidance counselor talk me out of my dream of being a cartoonist for @entity73			0
" " he said , ' oh there 's no future in comics , you 're not going to make a living doing that			0
' he said , ' well , you 're good at drafting , you 're good at math , you 're creative , why do n't you be an architect ? ' so i decided , ok , i 'm going to be an adult , i 'm going to grow up , and this is what i 'm going to do for a living			0
" after three years at architecture school , @entity2 said , he realized it was n't what he wanted to do			2
with the support of parents who were n't interested in pushing him into any specific career , but rather just " really wanted me to be happy , " @entity2 took a chance on his passion			1
" i suppose i had my rock star fantasies while i was singing into my hairbrush in the bathroom mirror , but i never really consciously said , ' ok , this is what i 'm going to do for a living and i 'm going to be @entity2			2
' my hobbies just sort of gradually became my vocation , " he said			0
of course , @entity2 also saw a children 's book as the perfect opportunity to indulge his quirky humor			1
as @entity40 tells his classmates in the book , " maybe i 'll be a gorilla masseuse , or an artist who sculpts out of chocolate mousse			1
" in typical @entity2 style , @entity40 also suggests " professional pickle inspector , " " big sumo wrestler , " and " smelly pit - sniffing deodorant tester			1
" listen to weird @entity2 read an excerpt from his book			1
@entity2 's favorite career in @entity40 's possible future ? " master debater , " he said , with that instantly recognizable laugh			1
" i ca n't believe i got that through the censors			0
actually i was on the speech team in high school so that probably is pretty close			0
" " i do n't know if @entity40 is obsessive - compulsive , " @entity2 said , " but he seems to have a lot of ideas , his head is filled with a lot of random thoughts			1
i do n't know if that 's typical of all nerds , but that 's sort of how my brain is			0
if i can extrapolate it , maybe that 's something i share with @entity40			2
" lucky for @entity40 , @entity2 said , nerdy qualities come in handy professionally			1
he ought to know : @entity2 's unabashed and overt nerdiness was met with heavy rotation on @entity144 in the 1980s at a time when , he said , " being nerdy was n't quite so hip			1
" " i mean , it 's an extension of who i am , so i do n't have a lot of choice in the matter , " he said			0
even @entity2 's recent album " @entity155 " rides the nerd wave to success			1
the video for " @entity157 " has been viewed online over 100 million times			0
nerds are focused and probably obsessed about a few things , @entity2 said			2
" their field of vision is narrowed , that 's part of the description of a nerd , i think , but it 's that kind of laser focus and attention to detail and passion that also makes them very successful in their chosen field			2
" " i think when @entity40 finally does walk into whatever he wants to do , he 'll be able to settle down and focus a bit more			2
" what does @entity2 mean by focus ? how about weeks - long debates as to whether one of the sentences in " @entity30 " needed a semicolon , a dash or a period ? this was the first time @entity2 has ever worked with an editor , @entity185 from @entity33			1
for someone who has enjoyed the unhindered control of an artist , it turned out to be a positive experience			0
" @entity185 was a great partner in this , " he said			0
" i would write her four lines of verse and she 'd write me back four pages of notes			0
" " we finessed this text for a very long time and i 'm very happy with the way it turned out			0
it was just really great to have somebody that i could have those kinds of dialogues with			0
" likewise , @entity2 is happy with the presentation of his ideas by illustrator @entity207			2
the whimsy @entity207 brings to the collaboration is something @entity2 feels is just right			0
" he really has a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality			0
i think it was just the perfect partnership for this picture book and i 'm very glad that @entity185 put us together , " he said			0
@entity2 confesses he 's been bitten by the children 's book bug			1
" regardless of how this book does , and of course i hope it does very well , but i would like to write at least a few more			0
it was really a wonderful experience and i 'd love to do it again			0
" what could be better news for longtime @entity2 fans who want to make their favorite satirist a family affair ?			0
