the next phase in the underwater search for @entity2 has begun			1
the @entity6 search vessel arrived in the search area in the southern @entity8 and started its search monday morning ( sunday evening et ) , the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) said			1
it marks the beginning of a potentially year - long search operation , spearheaded by @entity14 authorities			2
the ship , and two others which will arrive within the month , will conduct detailed sonar sweeps in an attempt to locate wreckage of the plane			2
the disappearance of @entity2 is arguably the greatest mystery in the history of commercial flight , with an extensive search failing to turn up a single piece of definitive evidence of its whereabouts			1
here 's where we are with the search for @entity2			1
what happened initially ? around 1:30 a.m. on march 8 , air traffic controllers in @entity36 , outside @entity37 , lost contact with @entity2 , a @entity39 , over the sea between @entity41 and @entity42			1
the plane 's transponder , which identifies the aircraft and relays details like altitude and speed to controllers , stopped transmitting , and the passenger jet seemingly disappeared without a trace			1
planes and ships from 14 countries initially searched areas of the @entity56 , the south of @entity42 and the @entity41 peninsula			0
the search was then widened and then shifted location as it was determined , through careful analysis of aircraft performance , cross-referenced with data from the @entity64 " handshakes , " that the plane diverted south			2
since then resources have been focused on a swathe of the @entity8 , around 2000 km ( 1242 miles ) off the west coast of @entity14 , the so - called " seventh arc			1
" continued analysis of the satellite data , along with a better understanding of the communication between aircraft and satellite and of aircraft performance limits has enabled investigators to further refine the search areas			2
although search teams have been focusing along the seventh arc or " partial handshake , " where investigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel , for months , it 's only within the past several weeks that investigators have shifted their focus further south			1
it is in this area that @entity6 has begun its underwater search			1
what has been done in the @entity8 so far ? after seven weeks of intense but fruitless searching , the international air effort to find the plane ended in late april , shifting the focus to an underwater search			1
hopes were raised in may as radio beacon signals -- " pings " -- were thought to have been detected , but the area where the pings were thought to originate from was discounted in may			2
since the active search was postponed , the @entity14 government has been creating an accurate survey of the sea floor in the search area			1
one ship , from @entity108 surveying company @entity107 , continues to map the underwater topography			0
to date , over 111,000 square kilometers of the wide search area have been analyzed and mapped by the @entity14 government and its contractors			1
the existing data for the sea floor in that area is at a very low resolution , says @entity117 , head of the @entity118 of @entity119 , the agency overseeing the mapping process			1
getting an accurate picture is crucial as the drones that will be conducting the underwater sonar search in the upcoming phase will need to be guided with precision to avoid damage			1
" in the second phase of the search , which involves towing devices close to the sea bed to get a very fine resolution picture of what 's down there it 's important to have that level of detail so we do n't run into objects , " he said			1
" it 's a long way from shore at very significant depths so it 's a logistical challenge			0
it 's unprecedented in terms of doing a survey of this size and in this remote location			0
" it has been an involved , long and difficult process -- back in march , @entity152 , vice chief of the @entity153 , said " we 're not searching for a needle in a haystack , we 're still trying to define where the haystack is			0
" authorities are confident that they have accurately identified the correct search areas now			2
@entity158 , chief commissioner and ceo of the @entity4 , the agency leading the search , told @entity3 's @entity163 that , should satellite analysis have led his team to the right spot , the current technology would locate aircraft wreckage			2
" what we 'd say is we 've probably limited it to a small number of haystacks , and we have very good techniques for detecting needles in those haystacks , " he said			0
" we have high confidence that if we 've got the right haystack , we 'll find the needle in it			0
" in a statement , the @entity4 also said that the enhanced data from the detailed mapping will greatly assist the search teams			1
" the recently acquired ( underwater survey ) data has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time , " the statement read			2
the survey also reveals finer features that were not visible in previous , low - resolution survey data			0
at the request of the @entity41 government , the @entity14 government -- in particular the @entity4 -- has been tasked with leading what will almost certainly turn out to be a long , painstaking search			2
" the complexities surrounding the search can not be understated , " the @entity4 says			0
" it involves vast areas of the @entity8 with only limited known data and aircraft flight information			1
" what happens next ? the @entity14 government said in august that it has picked @entity204 , a @entity108 company for the mapping and the next phase of undersea search , along with a vessel , the @entity6 , supplied by the @entity41 government			1
the latter arrived at its assigned search zone late sunday and deployed towed sonar to begin the search on monday			1
it will conduct search activity for 12 days before going to @entity215 , in western @entity14 , for resupply			0
the search vessel will be joined by the two @entity108 ships , the @entity219 and the @entity220 , later in the month			0
the @entity220 is currently finishing up detailed mapping of the search zones			1
" the current plan envisages that we will progressively cover our priority search areas over the course of about a year , " the @entity4 's @entity158 told @entity3 by phone			0
what we know is that the aircraft will be found close to the arc , the final attempt at communication between the aircraft systems and ground stations			0
we 've done progressively more refined and detailed analysis of the other satellite information that has enabled us to prioritise ( search areas ) along that arc			0
" we have a high probability that the aircraft will be found at the southern end of that long arc			1
we now know in considerable detail what almost all of the search area looks like , we 've mapped these in detail			2
we can tow our sonar equipment about 100 meters ( 329 ft ) from the ocean floor in confidence that we wo n't run into any unexpected obstacles			0
" what happens if / when the wreckage is found ? @entity158 says that it largely depends on where , and how , the plane is found			0
the @entity14 contingent , he says , is still discussing plans with their @entity41 colleagues on how to proceed in the event of a positive identification of plane wreckage			0
" if you have a debris field identified , to be able to know what to do with it requires careful mapping and photographing , which will take up to a month , " he says			0
" until we 've got that largely completed we wo n't understand the sequence of what we 're able to do in relation to wreckage and human remains			0
" what happens if they do n't find it within the current search timetable ? there is @entity14 $ 60 million ( $ 52.8 mil ) earmarked by the @entity14 government for mapping and underwater search , and @entity14 expenditure is to be matched by @entity41 government			2
it is a significant resource upon which to draw , @entity158 says			0
however , " if at the end of that we have n't found the aircraft , then it 's really going to be a matter for governments to decide what 's next what resources they might wish to supply and i ca n't really preempt what that discussion might be			0
" a new air of " cautious optimism " pervades the search teams , yet it seems that there are still plenty of uncertainties to overcome before the @entity2 mystery is finally put to rest			1
@entity3 's @entity163 contributed to this report			0

next phase of search operations starts with @entity6
search follows intensive sonar mapping of huge area of seabed in southern @entity8
@entity2 disappeared without a trace over six months *ago*
even after an intensive search , nothing was found
