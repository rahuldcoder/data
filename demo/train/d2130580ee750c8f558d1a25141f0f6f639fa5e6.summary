for almost 200 years @entity5 's @entity4 has had a strict men - only policy , meaning even its patron , @entity3 , was denied entry			1
but it seems the tide has finally turned for the world 's most prestigious sailing club , after it voted in favor of allowing women to become members for the first time in its history			1
the elite club , based in the dramatic 16th century @entity4 on the @entity18 in southern @entity5 , unanimously voted for the new rules this week			1
of its 475 members , 150 attended the meeting -- all agreeing to introduce the rules from @entity24 next year			0
the membership changes require no further vote , but still need to be ratified by all members			0
founded in 1815 , the yacht club has an illustrious place in @entity5 history , launching the first ever @entity31 -- so named after the @entity32 beat their @entity34 rivals in their boat " @entity36			1
" in 1826 , the club also started the annual @entity39 sailing regatta , which kicked off on monday and features more than 8,000 sailors from across the world			1
