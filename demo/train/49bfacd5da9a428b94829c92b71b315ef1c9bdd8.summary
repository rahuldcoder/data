@entity0 , @entity1 -- two @entity1 labor groups suspended their nationwide strike monday over the elimination of the country 's fuel subsidy and urged demonstrators to go home " in order to save lives and in the interest of national survival			1
the @entity14 and the @entity15 cited successes gained by demonstrators , including an announcement monday by president @entity19 slashing fuel prices , in its announcement suspending the strikes			1
" in the past eight days through strikes , mass rallies , shutdown , debates and street protests , @entity1 demonstrated clearly that they can not be taken for granted and that sovereignty belongs to them , " @entity14 president @entity23 and @entity24 , president of the @entity15 , said in the statement			1
but a third organization , the @entity32 , issued a statement deploring the suspension and urging continued strikes and protests until the government agrees to restore gas prices to what they were before the government ended the subsidy			1
" @entity1 should not be discouraged by the abrupt and unwarranted suspension of strike by its @entity47 partner ; neither should the militarization of the protest centers deter @entity1 in their resolve to rid the polity of this class of looters and profiteers that are responsible for mass poverty , unemployment , social insecurity and untold hardships of the majority of @entity1 , " @entity32 secretary @entity43 said in the statement			2
in an earlier statement on the group 's blog , @entity43 said the group and a related organization , the @entity63 and @entity64 , had decided sunday that they would continue their strikes and mass protests after talks with the government failed			2
" however early this morning , our joint leadership advised @entity1 to continue the strike but ( said they ) should stay at home in view of the resolve by the @entity77 to unleash violence on @entity1 who want to exercise their right to protest and procession , " @entity43 said in the statement			2
the @entity32 is part of the @entity82 and has organized many of the protests and rallies against the government 's decision to end the fuel subsidy			1
on monday , the government deployed troops in @entity0 , and military forces set up armed checkpoints at most key bridges and along major roads			0
eyewitnesses told @entity2 that police and the army were not allowing protesters into demonstration zones , but there were no confirmed reports of violence			0
scattered demonstrations began in @entity1 after @entity19 announced on january 1 that the government would end the popular fuel subsidy , which was widely seen by citizens as one of the few perks of living in the oil - rich but largely impoverished nation of more than 160 million people			1
the government has said the removal of subsidies would free up billions of dollars to boost the economy and improve the country 's infrastructure			0
the removal caused the price of fuel and other goods to spike and became a rallying point for @entity1 angry over corruption and the alleged misuse of oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty			1
fuel that had cost about 65 nairas ( 40 cents ) before the subsidy was lifted rose to 141 nairas ( 86 cents )			2
on monday , after more than a week of protests , @entity19 announced in a speech that the government would reduce fuel prices to 97 nairas ( 60 cents ) per liter			1
he cited " the hardships being suffered by @entity1			2
" @entity43 rejected the @entity1 government 's concession and said his group would only accept a return to prices before the government cut the fuel subsidy			1
" the people have every right to tell the presidency and this class of looters and profiteers that @entity1 belongs to @entity1 , " @entity43 said			2
it was unclear monday whether the @entity14 or the @entity15 would accept the fuel - price cut and call for a permanent end to the strikes and protests			1
last week , a major oil union , @entity156 and @entity155 of @entity1 , had threatened to halt production in solidarity with protesters if the two sides did n't reach an agreement			1
a move to halt production would reverberate on the global market			0
@entity1 is the world 's eighth - largest crude exporter			0
@entity167 , a chief economist at the global investment firm @entity168 , said earlier this month that a subsidy removal could help @entity1 in the future			1
" if they 're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform , too			0
if they do that , @entity1 's growth can be , instead of 7 % -8 % a year , 10 % or 11 % , " @entity167 said			0
but there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure ; @entity1 is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world			0
finance minister @entity185 said @entity1 should not let the past determine the future			0
she said the goal now is to regain the citizens ' trust and move forward			0
" they can not say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward , " she said			0
@entity2 's @entity192 contributed to this report			0
