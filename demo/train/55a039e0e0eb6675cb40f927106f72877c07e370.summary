-- there were headlines when one of @entity6 's @entity5 electric cars caught fire in late october after the battery case was pierced by a piece of road debris			1
there were bigger headlines , and much speculation , when within six weeks , a second and then a third model s fire occurred in the wake of accidents			2
the fires are regrettable and must be investigated			0
no one is suggesting otherwise			0
we all need to know whether there 's a flaw in the @entity5 that must be corrected			1
but to use these incidents to question the viability of @entity6 as a company is wrong			1
this is a company that has achieved the remarkable in launching a new automobile , a new propulsion technology and a new automobile manufacturing enterprise in just a few short years and against very long odds			2
@entity6 's brilliant but often blustery chairman , @entity31 , quickly came to the defense of his company 's groundbreaking vehicle , going so far as to claim that @entity6 asked the government to investigate the cause of the fires -- a claim that @entity41 administrator @entity40 disputes			1
@entity41 is investigating , @entity40 said , but the agency made that decision on its own , with no request from the automaker			0
news about the fires has been overtaken by the announcement of @entity41 's investigation , the squabble between @entity31 and @entity40 and the tumble in the price of @entity6 's stock as investors began distancing themselves from a company that until those three fires had been a @entity53 darling			1
the whole thing is a shame			0
this has become much more than a query into a very few vehicle fires			0
electric cars have been politicized and many are taking the @entity6 fires as a sign that electric vehicles are too new , too different and too dangerous to be allowed on our roads			1
additionally , some in the investment community and a few politicians critical of @entity6 and other electric vehicle developers for using government loans have made the fires a referendum on @entity6 itself			1
( @entity6 , which received loans from the @entity81 's new technology program , repaid its loans nine years early			1
) @entity6 has won the backing of two big players , @entity85 and @entity86 , which have ownership stakes in the company			1
whether it remains independent or eventually is absorbed by another carmaker , it is unlikely to end up on the scrap heap			0
it may transpire that @entity6 needs to redesign its cars -- or at least the location or shielding of the batteries -- in order to help prevent further fires			1
but to turn that into an indictment of electric vehicles in general would be wrong as well			2
the two @entity6 fires in the @entity101 occurred when their battery cases were pierced by metal objects struck when the vehicles were moving at high speeds			2
the third fire , in @entity107 , occurred when a speeding driver lost control and hit a stone wall			0
yet while a @entity6 's battery is directly beneath the car 's passenger cabin , the flames were channeled to the front , where an engine would be if @entity117 had gas engines			1
this is part of the @entity5 safety design			2
the passenger cabins did n't burn			0
the cars ' safety systems warned the drivers to pull over and get out because something was amiss			0
the same type of accident involving a conventional gasoline - fueled vehicle might not have resulted in a fire			0
but think of the damage a hefty metal trailer hitch or length of scrap iron could do after piercing a conventional vehicle 's relatively thin floor and entering the passenger cabin			0
it 's not a pretty picture			0
the location of the @entity6 's battery pack may well have saved one or both drivers from terrible injury in the road debris incidents , even though the cars burned			1
meantime , a typical conventional car with 15 gallons of gas on board carries the explosive power of 210 sticks of dynamite			0
but most of us drive around all day long blissfully ignoring that deadly potential			0
gasoline is the devil we know , and familiarity lets us overlook its flaws			0
electric cars , though , are new and different and challenge the status quo			1
that makes them a target for suspicion and for criticism			2
we are not comfortable with things we do n't know			0
we wo n't know until @entity41 completes its investigation whether the design of the @entity5 is inadequate			1
we should wait until then before contemplating obituaries -- for @entity6 or for the electric vehicle			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity6 's @entity5 electric cars have caught fire three times in recent *months*
@entity172 : we need to know whether there 's a flaw that needs to be corrected
but it 's wrong to use this to question viability of the company or electric cars , he says
@entity172 : electric cars are new and different , but they should n't be target for suspicion
