@entity7 flared at @entity8 , a sprawling institution in the country 's largest city			2
it is one of several schools across the country where demonstrators have turned out in recent days to protest government policies			1

it was unclear how many more people were wounded in that attack			0
the campus website said the school will be closed until final exams start on may 13 " due to the current situation			0
" the unrest came as the @entity39 continued to try to impose a cease - fire in @entity3 and organize an observation force to monitor adherence by the regime and the opposition			1
can @entity39 monitors help forge peace in @entity3 ? @entity48 videos posted on the internet show demonstrators and burned campus rooms at @entity8			1
student demonstrators also turned out at @entity52 , the @entity53 branch of @entity54 and other towns			0
@entity56 , @entity17 spokeswoman , said the ferment is a sign that the regime is turning its focus to campus dissenters			1
" they have pretty well hammered farmers and villagers			0
they have targeted many of the professionals , " she said of the regime			1
" they are just shifting their attention			1
" @entity56 said students have been staging protests since the uprising began in march 2011 but now " more and more university students are coming out as the barrier of fear is eliminated			1
" the regime , she said , typically has reacted to student demonstrators by surrounding the campus where they have been protesting , arresting a few students and beating them up , she said			1
now , they are " stepping up the brutality " by firing tear gas and live ammunition , she said			0
at @entity87 , one person died after security tossed him from a window , @entity56 said			1
" this has been building up , " @entity56 said			0
" for many of these students , it is impossible to be educated and know what 's happening in your country and not stand up and speak			1
" she said the students taking part in the protests are from all fields of study			1
" it 's not just the literature people			0
it 's the engineering folks			0
it 's the law students			1
they are coming out and they are demanding freedom			0
" she said security forces were targeting anything that might be interpreted as dissent , such as students sitting silently on the ground			1
the phrase " stop the killing ! " assigns no blame , but it too has been targeted , she said			0

the syrian revolution 2011 page on @entity124 is reporting that students at the @entity126 were holding a demonstration in solidarity with the students in @entity3			2
" i stand with the students at the @entity8 and its martyrs , " a protest flier said			1
@entity0 can not independently verify reports of violence and deaths within @entity3 because the government has restricted access by most of the international media			2
the reported attacks come despite the presence of the @entity39 observers , who have reported cases of cease - fire violations from the government and the opposition			2
the cease - fire went into effect april 12 and is part of a six - point peace plan negotiated by @entity39 and @entity151 joint special envoy @entity152			0
@entity152 's plan includes allowing humanitarian groups access to the population , releasing detainees , starting a political dialogue and withdrawing troops from city centers -- a mandate the government has not met , according to the @entity39			0

a total of 300 are expected to be in the country by the end of the month			0

though the @entity185 seeks an end to all violence , most of the attacks have been by the government forces , said @entity189 , the @entity190 spokesman			0
" so far , the @entity3 regime has taken , really , almost no steps toward fulfilling the core commitments of the @entity152 proposal , " he said			2
@entity3 's protests started peacefully in march last year , but a government crackdown spawned violence that has left thousands dead and prompted some military defectors to take up arms against the regime forces			2
the government has consistently blamed the violence on " armed terrorists			0
" the @entity39 estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the conflict while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000			2
