@entity0 -- ever wondered where your cat goes after it leaves the house at night ? @entity6 what your dog gets up to when it is off the leash ? one man was and he has now designed a gps tracking collar to get a glimpse into the private life of his pet			2
@entity16 , from @entity17 in the @entity18 , wanted to work out why his cat @entity20 was putting on weight , so he designed a " cat nav " to track where he went at night			1
with his new gps collar , @entity20 's secrets have been revealed , including his penchant for chasing chickens in the early hours of the morning			0
" he was actually traveling a couple of miles pretty much every night , visiting other houses and we suspect those other houses were feeding him , " says @entity16			0
now that the mystery of @entity20 's expanding waistline has been solved , @entity16 has developed the " g - paws " device he says will be available soon for purchase by other curious pet owners			1
animal tracking devices have been available for years using various technologies and at a wide range of costs so make sure to compare the various brands before purchasing one			0
@entity44 is based on existing gps technology and the data can be plotted directly onto @entity47			2
the light weight , waterproof device takes a recording every five seconds and @entity16 says it is accurate to two or three meters so you can see the precise route of your furry friend			2
but @entity44 does n't give live data -- so no real - time stalking -- which @entity16 says has helped him keep the cost and weight of the unit down			1
it 's not just cats who are going to have their secrets blown -- the @entity44 device can also be fitted to a dog 's collar			1
if you want to catch your lazy dog - walker , this could tell you exactly how many miles your pet is getting exercised each day			0
and @entity16 says he 's even been approached by pigeon racers and hawk owners to see if the @entity44 might work for their birds			1
" everyone who owns a pet -- whether it 's a cat , a dog , a pigeon -- has got a curiosity that when they 're not around , what 's that animal up to ? " he said			0
for all those greedy cats doing the nightly neighborhood rounds , the multiple dinner days may soon be over .			0
