-- the 9th @entity1 ruled friday that same - sex marriages can resume in @entity3 , a move that the @entity5 paved the way for on wednesday			1
three judges on the appeals court made it possible for local governments to issue marriage certificates for gay and lesbian couples with a few words : " the stay in the above matter is dissolved effective immediately			2
" very soon after , cheers erupted and camera flashes flickered as @entity18 and @entity19 obtained a marriage license and wed at @entity22 's city hall			1
the two were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage from taking effect			2
" this is a profound day for our country , and it 's just the right thing , " said @entity3 attorney general @entity27 , shortly before presiding over @entity29 's and @entity19 's wedding ceremony			2
" justice is finally being served			0
" @entity3 's @entity5 struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage in may 2008 , ruling that the state 's constitution gives " this basic civil right to ( marry to ) all @entity3 , whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as to opposite - sex couples			1
" but months later , 52 % of voters backed proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they can only be between a man and a woman			2
the measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold in the state , though lawsuits followed			0
state officials declined to stand behind @entity45 -- and , thus , its prohibition on gay marriage -- though private parties did step in and offer to do so			0
a federal appeals court later ruled that @entity45 was unconstitutional , though it still issued a stay on same - sex marriages until the @entity64 @entity5 could weigh in			1
that happened in a 5 - 4 decision wednesday , when the high court dismissed an appeal of that federal court ruling on jurisdictional grounds			1
that meant friday 's news -- the resumption of same - sex marriages in the @entity3 -- was expected , even though no one knew when it would happen			1
the @entity5 ruled that the private parties backing @entity45 did not have " standing " to defend the ballot measure			0
chief justice @entity79 wrote the majority opinion , joined by fellow conservative justice @entity81 and more liberal justices @entity82 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
" we have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend a state statute when state officials have chosen not to , " wrote @entity79			0
this decision was cheered by gay marriage supporters in @entity3 , though it skirted the larger issue of whether same - sex marriage is a constitutional " equal protection " right that should apply to all states			1
so , too , did another landmark ruling that same day on @entity99 : it struck down part of the @entity102 and found that the federal government must recognize legal same - sex marriages , though it did not compel them to be legalized in the 37 states where they currently are not			1
@entity5 cases rest of citizens who sued , made history still , both decisions were resoundingly cheered by gay rights supporters			2
many who believe marriage should only be between a man and a woman , however , were disappointed			0
and that held to form on friday as well , after the @entity118 's ruling allowing same - sex marriages in @entity3			1
" this outrageous act tops off a chronic pattern of lawlessness , throughout this case , by judges and politicians hell - bent on thwarting the vote of the people to redefine marriage by any means , even outright corruption , " the @entity120 said in a statement			0
" ... if our opponents rejoice in achieving their goal in a dishonorable fashion , they should be ashamed			0
" @entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0

@entity18 and @entity19 wed at @entity141
they do so after a federal appeals court lifts an order banning same - sex marriages
the @entity64 @entity5 paved the way for the move with a ruling wednesday
