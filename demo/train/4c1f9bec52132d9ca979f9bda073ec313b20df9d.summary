@entity0 -- forget , for now , the traditional debates over taxes and spending or national security			2
the flashpoint in presidential politics , at the moment anyway , seems to be more about age			1
conservative columnist @entity13 labels the incumbent , president @entity14 , an adolescent			1
others from the right -- @entity18 's @entity17 among them -- are leading the charge in labeling @entity20 too old			2
and the debate is hardly limited to what @entity22 think of the current and perhaps future @entity25 standard bearers			1
@entity26 , who has firsthand experience on the receiving end of the age debate , took issue this past week with the " younger " members of the prospective @entity22 2016 field			1
" first - termers like @entity35 , ( @entity36 ) @entity33 and that extreme - right - wing guy -- @entity38 ? all running for president now , " @entity26 said			1
" i do n't think they 've got enough experience yet			2
" that last part suggests @entity26 's beef has more to do with legislative experience than the actual age of the three freshmen senators thinking about running for president in 2016			1
not to mention his clear ideological differences with them , especially @entity38 and @entity35			2
what @entity26 said publicly tracks a line of thought many @entity22 debate more privately : after arguing for five - plus years now that @entity14 -- a freshman senator when elected -- was n't ready for the highest office in the land , does it make sense for @entity22 to nominate a freshman senator ? double standard on age ? ironically , that argument is advanced most by @entity22 who anticipate @entity60 as the @entity25 nominee and use terms like experienced and formidable -- not old -- to describe her			1
for point of reference , @entity60 is 66 now			2
@entity69 and @entity35 are 51			2
@entity38 is 43 , and @entity33 and @entity71 are 42 @entity26 was 73 when he became the @entity22 presidential nominee in 1996 -- the oldest first - time presidential nominee			1
@entity60 allies were n't shy , in public and even more so in private , in suggesting the @entity76 senator was too old			2
nor were @entity25 , especially those in @entity14 's inner circle , shy about suggesting that 2008 @entity22 nominee @entity79 , who was 72 on @entity80 that year , was too old for the rigors of the presidency			1
so in some ways , what goes around comes around now that the age debate is focused on @entity20			2
she is 66 -- and would be 69 on @entity86 if she assumed the presidency in 2017			2
that is the same age as @entity89 in 1981			2
so then is it sexist when conservatives who treat @entity89 as a demigod say @entity60 , the former secretary of state , would somehow be too old ? going too far writing this past week on @entity1 , conservative commentator @entity93 said age was openly discussed when @entity89 , @entity26 and @entity79 ran for president			1
so why not when @entity60 runs ? fair enough			2
like other candidates , @entity60 will be asked to release health records and to make her doctors available for interviews			1
some candidates are more cooperative than others on this front			1
but it is a fair , and relevant , avenue of inquiry , regardless of whether the candidate for president is a man or a woman			1
or in his or her 40s or 60s for that matter			0
but how it is raised can make a huge difference			0
as a substitute host for @entity117 this week , @entity18 's @entity17 tossed in a plastic surgery reference : " she 's going to be old			0
i do n't know how far back they can pull her face			0
" he later argued on @entity18 that " any objective fact about @entity20 " will be labeled out of bounds			1
many conservatives make that argument , suggesting , as @entity93 also did , that @entity60 thrives in a world of double standards			0
at times they have a case			0
but the cosmetic surgery line was n't an " objective fact about @entity20			0
" it was mean and , yes , sexist			0
veteran @entity22 strategist @entity133 says many conservatives probably feel justified repeating against @entity60 the age argument @entity25 used against @entity89 long ago			1
" however justified they might be , it does feed right into the opposition meme , " she said			0
@entity133 is among those -- " in the minority " as she puts its -- not fully convinced that @entity60 will run			0
but if she does , @entity133 says , the age debate will intensify			0
" the first to pick it up will be her primary opposition			0
" a veteran @entity25 strategist close to @entity60 said a politician 's age becomes an issue only when the politician behaves in a way that makes it an issue			1
" it 's all how you act and think , " the strategist said , speaking on the condition of anonymity			0
@entity157 , who was @entity26 's 1996 campaign manager , said just about anything , including age , can be relevant as a presidential campaign issue			1
but , he added , " the woman thing is such an unknown			0
" another @entity22 strategist with presidential campaign experience chimed in with a one - word " nope " when asked if it is wise to raise @entity60 's age			1
" perhaps that her politics / policies are outdated , or that she has been part of @entity0 too long , " this strategist suggested			0
life expectancy a more relevant point a national journal report on this debate this week smartly focused on a question more relevant than chronological age : the life expectancy of the candidate in question			1
a chart from that report suggests that @entity60 " would have the longest total life expectancy of any president yet			1
" still , a @entity60 candidacy -- assuming she won the @entity25 nomination -- would present voters with a generational question			1
her husband was 46 when he took office in 1993			0
@entity192 was 54 in 2001			0
@entity14 was 47 in 2009			0
all three were elected to two terms ; all three will have ended their presidencies in their 50s or early 60s			0
" @entity203 does n't go back , " former @entity198 gov. @entity197 said in a conversation several months ago -- meaning once the mantle of leadership is passed to one generation , he could not envision voters going back to an older generation			0
" except for @entity20 , " he said			0
" she is the only one who could do it because of the historic aspect of her candidacy			0

questions about *potential* @entity22 , @entity25 presidential candidates ' ages a flashpoint
both sides have *alternately* argued candidates are either too young or old over the years
political strategists say the relevance of the question *depends* on the way it is asked
the life expectancy of the president is a far question , strategists say
