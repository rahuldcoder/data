-- the number of aging men and women in @entity6 prisons is growing rapidly , @entity1 said friday , and it expressed concern for their care behind bars			1
because of their age , older prisoners incur medical costs that are three to nine times as high as those for younger prisoners , the campaign group said in its 106 - page report , titled " @entity19 : the @entity20 in the @entity6			1
" prison officials are hard - pressed to provide the appropriate housing and medical care for older prisoners , the report says			1
" prisons were never designed to be geriatric facilities , " said @entity25 , a senior adviser to the @entity6 program at @entity1 and author of the report			2
" yet @entity6 corrections officials now operate old age homes behind bars			2
" @entity1 pointed out that life sentences mean those prisoners reach old age in prison			0
almost 10 % of state prisoners are serving a life sentence , it said , and another 11.2 % have sentences longer than 20 years			0
prisons face a number of challenges in caring for these prisoners , the group said			0
they include tight budgets , prison architecture not designed for age - related disabilities , limited medical facilities and staff , lack of support from elected officials , and the pressures of day - to - day operations			0
it is equally as difficult for the older prisoners themselves who may be frail or impaired			2
prison rules and customs were n't designed with them in mind , @entity1 said			0
" walking a long distance to the dining hall , climbing up to a top bunk , or standing for count can be virtually impossible for some older prisoners , " the group said			1
" incontinence and dementia impose their own burdens			0
" @entity1 called for changes to harsh sentencing rules regarding long mandatory minimum sentences and reduced opportunities for parole			1
it also called for changes to prison facilities and medical care , as well as prison rules that are tough on older prisoners			1
" how are justice and public safety served by the continued incarceration of men and woman whose bodies and minds have been whittled away by age ? " @entity25 asked .			0
