-- in his recent @entity0 column , @entity1 lambasts @entity5 campaign 's slide show ad , " @entity6 , " as the epitome of government reliance propaganda			1
the conservative commentator protests that nothing less than our very liberty is at stake when a cartoon woman is depicted being aided at points in her life by the president 's policies , and the cries of outrage emanating from @entity21 indicate that many a right - wing pundit have heeded his call			1
but when @entity1 zeros in on his concerns that @entity26 is depicted with no man and no church in her life , his true agenda starts to come clearly into focus , and along with it , the core contradiction of the conservative ideology			0
the @entity33 claims to stand for individual liberty and opportunity , but it actually believes that only some individuals are worthy of those fundamental rights			1
as the slide show depicts @entity26 using the opportunities provided to her through government programs to excel in school , in parenting and in starting a small business , @entity1 quakes with frustration that she is doing so without a man			1
at one point , he bellows , " instead , the state has taken their place and is her primary relationship			0
" but his core charge is ludicrous			0
just because the story does n't introduce a male character does not mean that @entity26 's life is bereft of relationships			2
with or without a man , the truth is that any woman will face most of the situations shown in the slide show at some point in her lifetime and will be at a competitive disadvantage without programs that offer equal opportunity to succeed personally and professionally			1
conservatives who continue to wage a war on women 's health and economic parity willfully ignore the basic facts facing @entity73 women today			1
seventy years after @entity74 popularized the idea of women in the workplace -- or at least as factory line workers while the men were at war -- women still only make 77 cents on the dollar compared with men for doing the same job			1
innovative and entrepreneurial women fare no better			0
male - founded start - ups receive four times more venture capital funding over female - founded start - ups			0
women - led companies are twice as likely to get debt versus equity capital , requiring that women shoulder more of the risk on their own			0
despite research showing that gender diversity within senior ranks of organizations translates into financial value , especially when innovation is part of the equation , women have not gained much footing			0
moreover , according to the 2010 census , four million more women than men live in poverty in the @entity73			0
and what about that government with which @entity1 is so concerned ? it must be rife with women who want to bilk the system for women like @entity26 , right ? wrong			2
the number of women representing @entity73 in @entity118 fell in 2010 for the first time in 30 years			0
women went from 93 seats in the @entity122 and the @entity123 to 90 combined			0
women represent less than 17 % of leadership at the federal level , a number that qualifies the @entity73 for a rank of 73 in the world for female representation in government			2
we 're tied with @entity133			0
women like @entity26 have systematically watched the right wing try to take away their opportunities and liberties			0
@entity137 have repeatedly voted against fair pay provisions , parental leave , job training and other proposals that allow women to obtain and pursue opportunity through their lives at the same rate as their male counterparts			1
the budget of @entity73 rep. @entity150 , @entity151 , slashes nutritional assistance that would disproportionately affect women and children , while providing billions in tax cuts for already wealthy individuals , the vast majority of whom are men or couples where the primary wage earner is male			2
it is no longer shocking that @entity137 continue to fight against equality ; their actions have been consistent and focused on eroding women 's rights and economic security			1
the only shocking fact is that @entity1 and other conservatives believe they can claim the mantle of " liberty " and " opportunity			1
" @entity26 and millions of other @entity73 women will secure their own liberty and opportunity only when the @entity33 stops trying to prevent our democracy from doing what it was designed to do : offer all @entity73 an equal chance at success			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

conservatives *criticize* @entity5 campaign 's ad , " @entity6 , " as *big* government
@entity181 : @entity33 continues to wage a war on women 's health and economic parity
she says women are at a competitive disadvantage if not for government programs
@entity181 : @entity137 claim to stand for individual liberty and opportunity , but it 's false
