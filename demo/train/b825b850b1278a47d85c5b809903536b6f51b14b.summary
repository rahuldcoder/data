-- the years preceding @entity1 in @entity2 are generally referred to as the " @entity3 " -- a cultural and economic golden age			1
the period was hardly one of utter utopia for all citizens			0
but in the wake of the conflagration that would shake the globe beginning in august 1914 , it came later to be seen as a period of calm before the storm			0
its cultural practices , too , seem tinged with an almost naive optimism			0
modernism in art and literature had gathered momentum well before the @entity1 , which began in earnest 100 years ago this fall			1
but with its eruption , those earlier @entity23 forms no longer seemed adequate in the face of the period 's upheavals , the destruction to bodies , to landscape , to culture itself			1
new experiments took up the task			0
opinion : the promise @entity1 could n't keep the violent disjunctures of @entity40 collage , for example , were a fitting way to of express the political and geographic revolution			1
@entity44 already practiced the form during the @entity46 of 1912 - 13 , often using the very newsprint that announced the latest battles			2
on the @entity1 itself , the pacifist @entity44 remained silent			1
his innovations with different media and materials , however , influenced movements -- from war - mongering futurism in @entity55 to pacifist @entity56 in neutral @entity57			1
while many artists claimed @entity61 itself as a renewed form of classicism , @entity59 nationalists derided it as a decadent @entity66 import ( and spelled it " @entity67 " accordingly )			2
in @entity59 as elsewhere , then , culture formed a parallel theater of war			0
as many artists became enemy combatants with the stroke of a pen , the cosmopolitan idyll of prewar @entity71 gave way to an increasing xenophobia			0
opinion : how a century - old war affects you the war and its representations indeed seemed bound up with one another at every turn			0
" i very well remember , " wrote @entity87 , " at the beginning of the war , being with @entity44 on the @entity90 when the first camouflaged truck passed			1
... @entity44 , amazed , looked at it , and then cried out , yes , it is we who made it , that is @entity61			1
" the @entity100 @entity99 artist @entity98 not only painted canvases in the sharp lines characteristic of his circle 's aggressive imagery , but also supervised the " dazzle " camouflage ( an angular patterning of black and white paint ) of over 2,000 ships for the @entity109			2
the seemingly gratuitous bewilderment of modernist abstraction was thus put in the more practical service of confusing rangefinders and eluding enemy fire			0
opinion : should nations pay the price for their leaders ' misdeeds ? but it was the @entity55 futurists who most enthusiastically embraced the war , using their works to agitate for intervention against @entity55 's traditional ally , @entity127			2
the @entity129 ringleader , @entity128 , declared that only a giant international conflict could shock @entity55 out of its cultural slumber			0
@entity128 's hymns to danger , speed and mechanized violence found their consummate realization in the @entity1 -- an event he deemed " the world 's greatest poem			1
" as volunteers along @entity55 's northern front , the @entity129 served as avant - gardists in the literal , military sense			2
along with their rhetoric of jingoistic virility , @entity129 painting and poetry nurtured a playful and subversive " anti-aesthetic " that would inspire artists for the rest of the 20th century			0
ironically enough , it was the anti-war stirrings of @entity56 that bore out its most immediate influence , first in @entity57 and then post-war @entity156			2
opinion : the mighty women of @entity1 from @entity159 , @entity56 borrowed strategies of shock and illogic , assaulting received truths and bourgeois morality alike			1
to these , however , the @entity56 married a resolute anti-nationalism , rejecting both the war and its institutional origins			2
yet even politically progressive artists turned to the war 's new spectacles as sources of stimulation and dynamism			1
painted while he convalesced from a mustard gas attack , @entity176 © ger 's " @entity177 " ( 1917 ) depicts the artist and his fellow @entity59 soldiers as virtual extensions of military machinery , their jointed arms mobile like metallic prostheses			1
opinion : how @entity1 gave us ' cooties ' many drew their inspiration from a newly transformed theater of hostilities , whether the shock of trench warfare , mobile x-ray machines or the terror and poetics of flight ( the first pilotless drones were notably developed by the @entity199 from 1916 - 17 )			2
the @entity100 sculptor @entity200 's notorious " @entity201 " ( 1913 - 15 ) features an armored , machine - like body mounted atop an actual rock drill , glorifying an inhuman mechanization and anticipating even the battle droids from the @entity208 franchise 's prequel , " @entity206 , " at the century 's end not all @entity2 artists figured the period 's anxieties -- or witnessed its havoc -- in the same manner			1
following in the tradition of @entity224 and the @entity225 alike , @entity222 would later complete grotesque renderings of soldiers wearing gas masks and battlefields strewn with trenches and corpses			1
in works made just after the war , he ( like his @entity66 compatriot @entity226 and other @entity56 artists ) incorporated collage into his canvases , evoking the scores of amputated veterans visible in @entity66 's city streets , themselves virtual assemblages of prostheses			1
opinion : the ' bionic men ' of @entity1 these artists drew not only upon @entity129 experiments with newsprint , but also the metaphysical cityscapes of the @entity55 painter @entity243 , which conjure up a sense of both post-apocalyptic stillness and disquieting anticipation			0
a girl rolls her hoop across a sundrenched square in @entity243 's " @entity255 " ( 1914 ) , unaware of the hearse that looms in the arcade 's shadow -- the metaphor , perhaps , of a continent hurtling toward the void			0
the war 's traumas also spurred utopian cultural projects after the guns fell silent			1
during the war , @entity262 worked in a neurological ward in @entity265			0
his contact with the stream - of - consciousness ramblings of soldiers suffering from head wounds sparked his interest in the unconscious as a source of radical social and political transformation			0
opinion : how @entity1 gave us drones @entity279 's @entity278 movement transformed dadaist despair -- at both the war and the technologies that had led to it -- into a constructive assault on social and sexual norms			1
holding seminars and publishing questionnaires , the @entity278 campaigned in the 1920s and 1930s against the nationalist enmity that had caused the last war and that was leading inexorably toward another			0
at war 's end , modernist tendencies such as @entity61 , @entity159 and @entity294 came -- rightly or not -- to be associated with its violence			1
opinion : when chemical weapons killed 90,000 but artists generally abandoned the depiction of armored trains and disintegrating forms after the guns fell silent , rendering less threatening subjects in more soothing styles			0
dubbed the " @entity308 " by @entity309 -- the @entity278 painter , poet , playwright , novelist and filmmaker -- this period following the @entity1 witnessed a reprisal of neoclassical motifs , suckling mothers and other emblems of reassuring stability			2
with the gradual rise of fascism , such stability proved itself increasingly illusory , as even the most decorous of aesthetic traditions were put in the service of an aggressive , murderous ideology , and another war -- even more terrible than the first -- tore open the century			0
photo blog : @entity1 : the @entity328 of postcards			0

@entity331 : @entity23 art was not adequate to express @entity1 's chaos ; @entity334 *stepped* in
he says @entity44 's @entity61 was suited to times ; @entity159 and @entity56 would spring from war
apocalyptic imagery *emerged* , of prostheses , gas masks , corpses , military mechanization
@entity331 : at war 's end , soothing images , @entity346 ascended -- a tonic until the next war
