a few years ago , @entity0 was begging for food on the streets of northern @entity4			0
this week , the 12 - year - old girl was on a stage in front of tens of thousands of people , asking @entity9 why @entity10 lets children suffer			1
" there are many children neglected by their own parents , " @entity12 said sunday at a ceremony at a 400 - year - old @entity15 university in @entity4			1
" there are also many who became victims and many terrible things happened to them like drugs or prostitution			0
" " why is @entity10 allowing such things to happen , even if it is not the fault of the children ? " she asked the @entity9 , breaking down into tears as she spoke			1
another former street child , @entity31 , told @entity9 about his struggle to survive without a home			1
" i was feeding myself with what i can find in the garbage , " said @entity31 , 14			1
" i did not know where to go , and i was sleeping on the sidewalk			0
" " when i was in the street , i witness also things i do n't like , terrible things that happened to my companions in the street , " @entity31 said			1
" i saw that they were taught how to steal , to kill also , and they have no respect anymore for the adults			0
" pope @entity9 responded to @entity12 's question and @entity31 's testimony by giving the two children a big hug			1
" she is the only one who has put a question for which there is no answer and she was n't even able to express it in words but in tears , " the 78 - year - old @entity9 told the crowd			1
@entity12 and @entity31 are both in the care of @entity60 ng @entity59 , a non-governmental organization that looks after @entity4 's street children			1
the foundation came across @entity63 and her older sister a few years ago , said @entity65 , the group 's communication manager			0
the girls had left home -- where their impoverished parents were unable to support them or get them an education -- and were fending for themselves on the street , she said			0
they first attended one of the foundation 's drop - in centers before moving into a residential facility and starting to attend school			0
in november , their younger brother joined them at the foundation			0
@entity12 is still in touch with her mother and goes home to see her at @entity82 , @entity65 said			2
the foundation 's center where @entity12 lives is home to about 40 other former street children			1
" most of them are victims of the terrible things that can happen in the street , " including physical and sexual abuse , @entity65 said			2
but @entity12 's tears in front of the @entity9 on sunday were apparently prompted by the intensity of the moment , not because of her own experiences			1
she asked the question " on behalf of all the children we take care of , " not because of " something personal regarding her own story , " @entity65 said			2
the @entity9 touched on the street children theme again later sunday when he celebrated @entity104 in a @entity4 park with millions of people , despite the soaking rain			1
" we need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed , cherished and protected , " he told the enormous crowd			0
" and we need to care for our young , not allowing them to be condemned to a life on the streets			0
" the @entity9 had visited the center where @entity12 and others live on friday after celebrating @entity104 at @entity117 , and reportedly said he was " very moved " by what he saw			1
there are estimated to be more than 1.5 million street children in the @entity121 , about 70,000 of them in the @entity4 metropolitan area , according to the @entity123 , another group that cares for them			1
in his account , @entity31 described seeing some of his friends sniffing glue and taking other drugs			2
he said he learned to be wary of adults offering money or help because it was often a trap to exploit the children			0
he initially declined an offer of support from @entity60 ng @entity59 but later found out that the organization was genuinely trying to help him			0
" i realized that not all people have no heart , " he said			0
the @entity9 left the @entity121 on monday , waving as he boarded his plane at the end of an @entity142 trip that also included time in @entity143			2
in the first visit by a @entity9 to the predominantly @entity121 in 20 years , @entity9 paid a visit to @entity146 , the city ravaged by @entity147 in november 2013			2
@entity9 had to cut short his time there at the weekend because of the approach of another typhoon			2
but it did n't stop him from donning a slicker to celebrate @entity104 in @entity146 on saturday for hundreds of thousands who gathered despite the stormy weather .			0

@entity158 , 12 , asks @entity9 why street children face drug abuse and prostitution
" she is the only one who has put a question for which there is no answer , " @entity9 says
he hugs @entity12 and @entity31 , a boy who *recounted* foraging for food in garbage
