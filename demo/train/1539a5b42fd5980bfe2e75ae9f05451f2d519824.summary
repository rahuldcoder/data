-- organizations today would never think of not investing in high growth markets like @entity3 and @entity4			1
yet they are still dragging their heels when it comes to investing in women , despite it being a win - win situation for the global economy , organizations and women themselves			1
this is not just a human rights issue -- it makes absolute business sense			0
research conducted throughout the world shows gender balance in top positions contributes to improved competitiveness and better business performance			1
in @entity26 this week , issues around women 's advancement and empowerment have been high on the agenda			1
the @entity29 's economic affairs committee voted down the nomination of @entity32 's @entity31 to the @entity34 board , calling for his candidacy to be withdrawn			0
it was a protest over the lack of women in top @entity40 posts			2
also , the @entity40 's justice commissioner , @entity41 , who is intent to impose an @entity40 - wide quota for women on supervisory boards , looks likely to have to go with a watered down proposal to be presented mid-november			2
debate on these issues is important precisely because it puts the issue of gender inequality on the table			2
it draws attention to the danger of having so few women at the top and encourages focus on the improved business benefits of engaging women , for individual organizations and the economy as a whole			1
but business leaders can not afford to be complacent and must demonstrate real progress			0
that 's why i set up the ceo @entity66 initiative with our ceo , @entity69 , and the @entity70			0
@entity71 needs to be driven from the top of organizations , and peer groups like ceo champions are so important because they are designed to create and gradually expand a group of leaders to act as champions of women 's empowerment , helping to achieve what i like to call " visibility with teeth			1
" what makes our peer group unique is our ability to take a strong leadership role in the broader global business community and form powerful coalitions			2
looking ahead , we have much to learn from other successful initiatives like the 30 % club in the @entity92 and @entity75 in @entity93			0
it is only through engaging with other groups and establishing greater visibility for ceo champions that we can drive real change			0
what is clear is that business leaders must commit to champion change -- to be transparent about their goals for change , to align their incentives systems to drive the change , and to make sure their work environments are flexible in a way that allows men and women who choose to work to be able to achieve all of their potential			2
if they do n't champion that change , they will be doing so at their own peril and quotas will be a public policy hammer of last resort			0
over the next decade , the impact of women on the global economy -- as producers , entrepreneurs , employees and consumers -- will be at least as significant as that of @entity3 's or @entity4 's one - billion - plus populations , if not greater			1
if women 's economic potential can be successfully harnessed and leveraged , it would be the equivalent of having an additional one billion individuals in business and in the workforce contributing to the global economy			1
it 's for this reason that @entity134 has been involved in the @entity136 global campaign , which unites governments , ngos , corporations , youth and others to partner toward ensuring women 's access to legal protection , education and training , finance and markets			1
just recently , @entity149 published new data outlining compelling evidence that women can be powerful drivers of economic growth			2
their estimates show that if female employment rates were to match male rates , overall gdp would grow significantly in the @entity158 by 5 % , in @entity159 by 9 % , and in developing countries like @entity161 by a massive 34 %			1
the @entity162 also published their annual @entity163 -- the data suggests a strong correlation between those countries that are most successful at closing the gender gap and those that are the most economically competitive			0
some companies are already investing in women and thereby betting on a brighter future -- for a workforce just waiting to blossom , for emerging economies whose development depends on this new talent , and , of course , for their own financial growth			0
in the current economic climate there really is no longer any excuse to not be investing in one of the largest untapped economic engines			0
you can not flick a switch overnight but the private sector has a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to lead on these issues .			0

in @entity26 this week , issues around women 's advancement and empowerment high on the agenda
over next decade , women 's impact on global economy expected to be as significant as @entity3 or @entity4
research shows improved gender balance in top positions contributes to better business performance
gdp growth of over 5 % possible for countries which increase female employment rates to the level of men
