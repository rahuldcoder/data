@entity1 , @entity0 " it 's a nightmare , " says @entity3			1
@entity3 , a 27 - year old @entity0 comedian who performs with a humorous theatrical group that calls itself the " @entity6 , " was speaking several days after a deadly gun battle erupted last week between suspected jihadists and police in the eastern @entity0 town of @entity11			1
news of the suspected @entity0 terror cell immediately sent ripples of fear through this small @entity18 country 's @entity6 community			1
" i was freaking out			0
really scared , " said @entity3 , who fears young @entity0 - born @entity20 could become victims of a backlash after the raid			1
" my mom said no one can go out tonight because of what happened , " said @entity24			0
the 19 - year old waitress said her frightened mother made her skip work the night of the anti-terror raid			1
both @entity3 and @entity31 were speaking in the lounge of a @entity6 youth center , @entity34			1
@entity34 opened little more than a year ago , with the goal of promoting a peaceful and productive blend of @entity18 and @entity38 values			0
but the center 's director said the recent reports of a suspected homegrown @entity0 terror cell -- emerging so soon after @entity44 jihadis massacred cartoonists in the @entity47 office of the satirical magazine @entity48 had threatened this vision of moderation and integration			1
" we condemn what 's happened			0
this is not our vision , our understanding of our religion , " said director @entity54			0
in @entity44 - accented @entity59 , he explained how @entity0 's @entity6 community was finding itself increasingly trapped between two ideological extremes			1
" we face [ @entity63 ] radicalization			2
but we also face the increase of @entity65 in @entity0 , " @entity54 said			1
" we know that stigmatization , @entity65 , discrimination help this radicalization of young @entity6 people here in @entity0			1
" the january 15 raid in @entity11 resulted in the shooting deaths of two @entity0 citizens			1
police said they were found in possession of assault rifles , handguns , explosives and police uniforms			2
the suspects have been accused of being part of a plot to target @entity0 police , inspired by the ultra-violent ideology of @entity84			1
the gun - battle triggered an international manhunt			1
since january 15 , @entity0 authorities have arrested and charged at least seven @entity0 with participation in a terrorist organization			1
the federal prosecutor 's office announced three of the suspects were intercepted at the airport in @entity1 while trying to fly to @entity93 , with plans to then travel on to @entity95			2
a senior @entity0 counter-terrorist official tells @entity2 the suspected leader of the @entity11 cell is a young @entity0 of @entity100 descent named @entity101			1
@entity101 -- who is still at large - appeared in an @entity84 propaganda video laughing and joking to the camera while driving a pick - up truck that was dragging at least half a dozen corpses through a field			1
he also brought his teenage brother to @entity95 , who has since appeared in photos posing alongside @entity84 fighters			1
@entity101 originally hails from a district of @entity1 called @entity112			0
he is not the only @entity112 native to embrace the @entity84 jihad			2
" there are several people who left here to fight in @entity95			0
and some who came back			0
that 's the danger , " said @entity112 mayor @entity119			0
she spoke to @entity2 in the neighborhood 's central square , which is ringed with halal butcher shops and grocery stores advertising their goods in @entity44 and @entity127			0
a polyglot procession of residents -- many of them women wearing @entity38 headscarves - strolled			0
in the side streets , one could over hear conversations in @entity44 , @entity127 and @entity134			0
@entity112 has a large , predominantly @entity6 population of first , second and third generation immigrants from @entity137			2
the mayor said the neighborhood also suffered from soaring youth unemployment estimated at more than 40 %			0
@entity112 raids as part of their effort to stop the suspected @entity84 - linked cell in @entity11 , @entity0 police have carried out multiple raids in @entity112 over the course of the last week			1
the defense attorney for a @entity112 native arrested by police last week said his client was innocent of terrorism charges			0
@entity153 argued that his client , an unemployed former 25 - year old security guard named @entity155 , did not fit the terrorist profile because he had no previous criminal record			0
" he lives in @entity112 , which is one of the neighborhoods most infested by terrorism , and thus it 's a miracle not to have problems with the authorities when you live there , " @entity153 said			0
while unemployment is rampant , online propaganda for @entity84 ' bloody interpretation of jihad is often only a button click away			2
@entity3 , the comedian who also hosts a radio show that touches upon @entity0 @entity6 affairs , laments that his radicalized peers " do n't learn their @entity38 in mosques or in institutions			1
they learn it on the @entity180			0
" he recalled meeting a young @entity6 convert			2
just a few months after embracing @entity38 in @entity0 , @entity3 said he read in a newspaper that the young man was killed fighting on the battlefields of @entity95			2
" it goes so fast ... even the religious leaders , they do n't understand it , " @entity3 said			0
" people radicalize themselves , " said @entity54 , director of @entity189			0
@entity54 says he has taken to social media , to denounce online propaganda urging volunteers to join @entity84			2
but he confesses the jihadi message can be tempting to vulnerable youths			0
" the speech to get you to go to @entity95 is very simple : you have your enemy , you want to have the power to build your future , and you do n't need to find a solution to the complexity of your life that we have here in @entity0 , " @entity54 said			2
it is this toxic mix of unemployment , marginalization and the clarion call of jihad , that have helped make @entity1 , the capital of @entity18 , a recruiting ground for terrorism			0
@entity0 terror cell has links to @entity84 journalist @entity215 contributed to this report			1

on january 15 , a gun battle during a raid by police in @entity11 left two @entity0 citizens dead
the suspects have been accused of involvement in an @entity84 - inspired plot to target police officers
the @entity6 community fears a backlash and rise in @entity65 that could increase radicalization
