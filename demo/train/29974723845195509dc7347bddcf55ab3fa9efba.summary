@entity0 -- flush with re-election vigor , president @entity2 called friday for @entity4 to immediately pass a bill already approved by the @entity6 that would maintain current tax rates for middle - class @entity8 while increasing taxes of wealthier citizens			1
in his first public comments since winning tuesday 's vote , @entity2 expressed openness to negotiate with @entity15 on how to deal with pending tax hikes and spending cuts that create the so - called fiscal cliff facing the economy at the end of the year			1
however , he also repeated his longstanding demand that @entity23 opponents to any kind of tax increase relent to the will of the @entity27 and the @entity6 -- and now the @entity8 people -- in letting tax rates increase on income over $ 250,000			2
nobody in either party wants the middle class , identified as families making less than $ 250,000 a year , to see taxes increase at the end of the year when lower rates set during the administration of former president @entity38 will expire , @entity2 said			1
" that makes no sense			0
it would be bad for the economy , " he told a @entity27 gathering of what aides described as middle class @entity8			0
" let 's extend middle class tax cuts right now			0
let 's do that right now			0
that one step would give millions of families , 98 % of @entity8 , 97 % of small businesses , the certainty that they need going into the new year			2
" noting the @entity6 previously passed a bill to extend the tax cuts to the middle class , but not income over $ 250,000 , @entity2 said : " all we need is action from the @entity27			1
" " i 've got the pen , " he said , reaching into his pocket to hold one up as the crowd applauded			0
" i 'm ready to sign the bill right away			0
i 'm ready to do it			0
" the president also announced he invited congressional leaders from both parties to the @entity27 next week to launch talks on finding a solution to the fiscal cliff , as well as consensus on how to strike a comprehensive deal to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt			2
separately , a bipartisan group of senators known as the " @entity79 " will reconvene next week to " assess where they are " in working out a bipartisan compromise on a long - term deficit agreement , a @entity6 aide told @entity1 on friday			0
the group 's previous talks have yet to bring a breakthrough			0
the gang of eight includes democrats @entity88 of @entity89 , @entity90 of @entity91 , @entity92 of @entity93 and the retiring @entity94 of @entity95 , along with republicans @entity96 of @entity97 , @entity98 of @entity99 , @entity100 of @entity101 , and @entity102 of @entity103			0
opinion : leave crisis to @entity15 long and tough negotiation while offering to consider unspecified reforms to costly entitlement programs sought by @entity23 , @entity2 ' s initial salvo in what will be a long and tough negotiation signaled he was unwilling to back down on the tax issue that was a central theme of his election campaign			1
" on tuesday night , we found out that the majority of @entity8 agree with my approach and that includes @entity119 , independents and a lot of @entity23 across the country , as well as independent economists and budget experts , " the president said			2
" that 's how you reduce the deficit ; with a balanced approach so our job now is to get a majority in @entity15 to reflect the will of the @entity8 people			0
" what 's in the fiscal cliff ? @entity2 and @entity27 speaker @entity135 are positioned as the lead negotiators in a showdown between @entity119 and @entity23 over the issue identified by voters as a top priority : reducing the chronic federal deficits and debt considered a threat to economic prosperity and national security			1
@entity135 , @entity146 , signaled a willingness to deal on friday but also maintained hard - line @entity23 opposition to any tax increase			1
" raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs everyone says they want , " @entity135 said at a news conference , noting that higher taxes on the wealthy will hit small business owners			2
later , however , he said that " everything on the revenue side and on the spending side has to be looked at			0
" @entity135 also called on @entity2 to take the lead in offering a workable plan that @entity23 can accept but stopped short of providing details , saying : " i do n't want to limit the options available to me or limit the options that might be available to the @entity27			1
" asked if tea party conservatives or others in his caucus might oppose an agreement they do n't like , @entity135 responded : " when the president and i have been able to come to an agreement , there has been no problem in getting it passed here in the @entity27			2
" the brewing political showdown in @entity0 left @entity8 financial markets unconvinced the two sides would resolve their differences and come to an agreement			1
analysis : @entity2 has limits on debt deal all three @entity8 stock indexes ended the week more than 2 % lower due to investor concerns about the fiscal cliff 's potential impact on the sluggish economy			1
markets and @entity8 business are also concerned that brinksmanship on the deficit could influence the deadline for raising the nation 's debt ceiling and eventually hamper the government 's ability to pay its bills			2
the fiscal cliff comprises two main elements : tax cuts from the administration of president @entity38 will expire on december 31 , triggering a return to higher @entity205 - era rates for everyone			2
in addition , $ 1.2 trillion in mandatory across - the - board budget cuts -- known in legislative parlance as the sequester -- will take effect next year unless @entity15 finds a way to offset that amount in the federal budget			0
the automatic cuts were intended to motivate legislators to work out an agreement instead of letting the sequester ever actually occur			0
@entity23 leverage weakened by election results @entity135 's leverage in negotiating a deal got weakened by the election that returned @entity2 to the @entity27 , broadened the @entity119 majority in the @entity6 and slightly narrowed the @entity23 majority in the @entity27			1
while the election resulted in another split @entity15 like the current session that has become a symbol of legislative dysfunction , both sides have signaled a possible new openness to an agreement that was unreachable in the past two years			0
in the final days of the campaign , vice president @entity233 referred to private talks with members of @entity15 on the pending fiscal impacts of expiring tax cuts and mandatory budget cuts			2
this week , @entity135 called on @entity2 to work with him to complete a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement -- the " grand bargain " that eluded them last year			1
@entity135 says @entity23 willing to compromise on fiscal cliff both @entity135 and @entity2 were held back from a deal back then because of pressure from their respective bases , retiring @entity248 rep. @entity248 of @entity249 told @entity1			1
" the ' no - tax pledge ' people in the @entity23 yanked @entity135 back and the ' do n't you dare touch the middle class ' entitlement people in the president 's party pulled him back , and as a result those talks collapsed , " @entity248 said			1
@entity135 said this week that a comprehensive agreement wo n't happen by the end of the year in the lame - duck session of @entity15			1
he proposed that the two sides use that time to set up a framework for substantive negotiations when the new @entity15 comes in next year while taking short - term steps to avoid the fiscal cliff			0
@entity90 , the no. 2 @entity267 in the chamber , said such a timetable could work			0
" we have a chance in the lame duck to at least start the process , and i think there 's a chance to rally bipartisan support , " he said			0
" these are basic issues we can work out , and the president is in a position to do that			0
" both sides agree the best outcome would be a broad deal addressing the overall need for deficit reduction , including reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs such as @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291			2
however , they remain far apart on exactly how to forge such an agreement			0
@entity2 campaigned on having wealthy @entity8 contribute more to deficit reduction efforts , and @entity27 spokesman @entity295 said friday that the president will veto any package that extends the @entity38 tax cuts for income over $ 250,000			1
" we ca n't just cut our way to prosperity , " @entity2 said friday			0
" if we 're serious about reducing the deficit , we have to combine spending cuts with revenue and that means asking the wealthiest @entity8 to pay a little more in taxes			1
" @entity135 and @entity23 oppose raising taxes on anyone , and instead back a broad reform of the tax system that would lower rates further for everyone while eliminating some deductions and loopholes			2
while @entity135 said this week that his side was open to increasing revenue from such reforms , he made clear that such increases should come from resulting economic growth instead of higher tax rates			1
in essence , @entity135 proposed the kind of tax reform championed by failed @entity23 presidential challenger @entity324 , whose plan was criticized by @entity2 and many economists for being unrealistic in assuming that the combination of closed loopholes and economic growth would equal the lost revenue of tax cuts			1
@entity2 's victory gives him new leverage in the budget battles after @entity23 forced the president and @entity119 into prolonged and sometimes bitter showdowns in the last two years			1
one top @entity267 with close ties to leaders on @entity340 and the @entity27 said that the imminent expiration of the @entity38 tax cuts means @entity2 " does n't have to do anything and everyone 's taxes go up , " which is a @entity23 nightmare			1
such an increase would affect personal income tax , the estate tax , dividends and capital gains taxes			0
in addition , some officials are hinting the feared sequester cuts do n't have to be implemented right away in the new year , giving at least a few months for a deal to be worked out			0
@entity2 , @entity135 stand ground on fiscal cliff @entity1 's @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 and @entity360 contributed to this report .			1

president @entity2 says his election victory shows @entity8 backs his plan
house speaker @entity135 says all options on spending and revenue are open
while both sides signal a willingness to deal , differences on details remain
the nation faces tax hikes and steep spending cuts at the end of the year
