@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's taken 11 years , thousands of miles and a few fistfuls of dollars for @entity5 to complete his film			1
but when you 've devoted your life to a cause as important as helping save the planet , it 's a small price to pay			0
director @entity5 holds a jar of bio-diesel ijn front of his " @entity15			1
" " @entity20 " gave us shocking revelations about the problem of global warming			0
now one film offers the solution			2
so starts the trailer to @entity25 's new film " fuel , " which charts the history of oil dependency in the @entity28 , examines the current energy crisis and , most importantly , how you and i can change how we source and use energy			1
the premise might sound a bit preachy and be a turn off for those experiencing green fatigue , but @entity5 's motivations for pursuing this direction warrant closer inspection			1
the 34 - year - old grew up in an oil - refining area in the @entity28 state of @entity45			2
within a 100 - mile radius of his childhood home there are 150 petrol - chemical facilities			0
" i watched many members of my family get sick from that pollution , " @entity5 told @entity2			1
" my mother had nine miscarriages			0
so from quite a young age i was affected by that and i really had the desire to go out and find other ways of making energy			1
" and it was n't just the miscarriages his mother experienced that encouraged @entity5 to look to alternative fuels			1
many of his family , he said , have either died or had problems with cancer			0
" the average oil refinery , " @entity5 said , " pumps out a cocktail of about 8,000 chemical combinations			1
less than 50 of them have been studied			0
but the majority of the ones which have are cancer causing			0
" his upbringing in @entity45 led @entity25 to start using bio-diesel , way before anyone was really talking about it as a serious alternative			0
he bought himself an old 1986 diesel - powered @entity82 which he christened the " @entity83			0
" " for me , it was like what @entity86 's horse would have been for him , " he said			0
his travels across @entity28 unearthed a genuine curiosity in bio-diesel ( made from cooking oil )			2
he began lecturing on the subject and started traveling the world in search of new energy technologies			2
armed with a masters in film studies -- to go with his degree in sustainable living -- @entity5 set about piecing his story together for a wider audience			1
the result is a compelling piece of environmental film - making which won the audience award for best documentary at the @entity107			1
but despite this rapturous reception , audience feedback prompted @entity5 to re-edit the film incorporating many more alternative energies			1
the new cut of " fuel " was officially launched in @entity28 cinemas earlier this month			2
@entity5 hopes that people will walk out of the cinema feeling empowered			1
" i distinguish that from inspiration or hope , " he said			0
" i think empowerment means people can start a new dialogue with a new set of concepts and information			0
even if you think you know about these subjects , you 'll watch the movie and have a completely different perspective and understanding of the issues			0
" @entity5 persuaded a host of celebrities to contribute to his film including @entity136 , comedian @entity137 and musician @entity138			1
@entity136 has been particularly supportive of both @entity25 and the film 's producer @entity139			2
the @entity142 entrepreneur has given " fuel " his backing as well as supporting @entity144 -- the world 's first ever open source national green educational curriculum			1
" it 's much more than just a green curriculum " @entity148 said			0
" any subject can be uploaded by teachers and shared with students all over the world			2
" the web site was launched in @entity156 this week after @entity5 and @entity148 had traveled from @entity157 in the algae - fueled car which they have dubbed " @entity161 "			1
the web site also allows visitors to download a 35 - minute educational cut of " fuel			2
" sadly , " fuel " is only showing in a handful of cinemas in the @entity28 right now , but @entity148 is confident that the film -- which she says cost around $ 6 million to make -- will soon reach a wider audience			1
and next year she hopes the film will be showing in cinemas across @entity175			0
the whole project has been a labor of love in more ways than one for both @entity25 and @entity148 who had a meeting of minds when they first met six years ago			0
the pair plan to marry on january 1 next year .			0
