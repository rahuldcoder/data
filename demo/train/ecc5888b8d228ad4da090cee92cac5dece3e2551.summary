-- maybe you chickened out on the one - way trip to @entity3 that was being offered			1
but never fear , there 's still a way for you to make a name for yourself			0
@entity8 is inviting the public to send their @entity11 and @entity10 to destinations beyond low - earth orbit , including @entity3			1
@entity15 idea , right ? pack lightly , because your name will fly in comfort on a dime - sized microchip aboard an @entity20 spacecraft that launches on december 4			1
the test flight will circle @entity22 a few times before a fiery reentry and a splashdown in the @entity26			0
sounds like fun , huh ? bet you 're ready to sign up			0
sleeper spaceship could carry first humans to @entity3 as an @entity33 intrepid explorer , you just enter your name -- and a few other details -- on the @entity8 website , click enter and you 're ready to go the distance			1
the names will also fly on future @entity8 exploration flights and missions to @entity3			1

there is a deadline for such important matters			2
to get your " boarding pass " for the first test flight , you 'll need to submit your name by @entity52			1
what makes this more attractive is that it does n't end in death on a barren planet			0

departure for the @entity65 is scheduled for 2022 , landing seven months later in 2023			0
the one - way ticket makes the mission possible because it greatly reduces costs , and the technology for a return flight does n't exist , according to @entity62 's website			2
