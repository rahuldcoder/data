@entity0 , @entity1 -- is it time to start carrying two mobile phones ? with the launch of a new no - frills handset , at least one manufacturer is hoping more people might soon be relying on multiple mobiles			0
unveiling its cheapest ever mobile phone , a $ 20 handset with a 35 - hour battery , @entity10 said the device 's extraordinary staying power could make it popular as a backup for when our main handsets run out of juice or prove too bulky to carry around			1
as he touted the @entity10 105 at this week 's @entity23 in @entity0 , an annual showcase for the newest hand - held gadgets , the company 's chief executive @entity21 suggested that the time has come for some of us to be using two phones			1
while some might balk at the idea of filling their pockets with yet more technology , the enduring popularity of some existing low - priced models suggests @entity21 could be right			2
modern mobiles might be capable of all sorts of trickery , but thanks to power - hungry screens and processors , many are incapable of staying switched on for long , despite the aid of various apps designed to wring out every last drop of battery power			0
not so @entity10 's 105			1
although this barebones device offers none of the internet connectivity of most modern phones , it will be able to sit on standby for more than a month between charges			2
the handset , which also features a dust and splash - proof keypad and an fm radio , has been primarily launched as a low - end phone that would appeal to customers in the developing world who may have infrequent access to electricity			2
@entity10 hopes that by focusing on budget as well as top end users it can reclaim ground from rivals such as @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 who have in recent years undermined the @entity71 multinational 's previously dominant position			1
@entity21 , @entity10 's chief executive , told @entity2 his company hoped other budget models such as the @entity76 , which includes top - end features such as internet and email access and a camera but a lower - end price of about $ 180 , would help it corner this market			1
@entity10 is n't alone in targeting this sector			2
earlier this month @entity84 announced a partnership with @entity87 manufacturer @entity86 to create a sub- $ 150 smartphone specifically aimed at developing markets in @entity90			0
but elsewhere in the world , @entity21 said his cheapest device would appeal as either a failsafe that users can turn to when their smarter handsets are struck dumb by power outage or as a novelty stand - in for costlier , bigger devices			2
" for some people it is their first mobile phone in an emerging economy for example , " he said			0
" for others it might be the device they toss into the glove box of the car as a backup device or maybe something retro chic that they might carry with them to a party and slip into a clutch instead of their larger smartphone			0
" of course , @entity10 's 105 is n't the only no - frills handset on the market			1
many manufacturers continue to produce phones that retail so cheaply that some are treated as disposable			0
over the past three years , @entity123 's @entity122 , for instance , has sold in steady numbers to users lured by pre-paid package deals that cost just a few dollars a month			0
but none of these boast the 35 - day battery life that would make them suitable for an always - on emergency standby			1
@entity21 is no stranger to multiple mobiles , admitting to @entity2 that up to 15 devices usually accompany him on his travels , although these are usually consigned to his luggage			0
" normally in my pockets i have four or five , " he said , adding that his array of handsets usually included rival models that he carried around to keep tabs on @entity10 's opposition			1
but he declined to reveal the contents of his pockets to @entity2 on the grounds that at least one of the devices could be a @entity10 prototype that needed to stay under wraps .			0

@entity10 chief exec suggests its customers will use $ 20 mobile as a backup
@entity21 says the 105 device has a standby battery life of 35 hours
phone is part of @entity10 's *strategy* of cornering budget end of mobile market
