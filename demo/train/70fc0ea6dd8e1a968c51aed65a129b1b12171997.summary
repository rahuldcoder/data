president @entity0 on friday said that @entity1 made a mistake in canceling the release of a movie after a cyberattack from @entity7 - backed hackers			1
" i am sympathetic to the concerns that they face			0
having said all that , yes , i think they made a mistake , " @entity0 said at a news conference friday			1
" let 's not get into that way of doing business			0
" @entity0 's statement came hours after the @entity18 announced @entity7 is officially responsible for the cyberattack on @entity1 , an attack law enforcement officials called a " game changer			1
" " we can not have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the @entity27 because if somebody is able to intimidate us out of releasing a satirical movie , imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they do n't like or news reports that they do n't like , " @entity0 said			1
" that 's not who we are			0
that 's not what @entity36 is about			1
" @entity27 government agencies have presented the @entity39 a list of options to respond to the @entity7 hack , according to @entity27 officials briefed on the matter			2
the range of options includes economic and banking sanctions -- but , the officials said , the list does not include adding @entity7 to the list of state sponsors of terrorism			1
the @entity27 will respond " proportionally " to the attack , @entity0 said , though he would not say how the @entity27 would specifically retaliate			2
he did note that the @entity27 has beefed up its cybersecurity infrastructure , but that " occasionally there are going to be breaches like this			0
" an @entity18 investigation linked the malware , infrastructure and techniques a group of hackers called " @entity64 " used in the @entity1 attack to previous @entity7 cyberattacks			1
the @entity7 - backed hackers broke into @entity1 's servers , published private emails and information and threatened to attack movie theaters screening " @entity72 , " a comedy film about an assassination plot on @entity7 leader @entity75			1
@entity1 ceo @entity76 rebuffed @entity0 's criticism in an interview with @entity80 's @entity79 , saying his company did not make a mistake			1
instead , @entity76 said @entity0 , the press and the public " are mistaken as to what actually happened			2
" @entity76 pinned the decision to pull back from the planned dec. 25 release on the major movie theater companies that told @entity1 they would not screen the film			1
" we have not caved , we have not given in , we have persevered , and we haven to backed down			0
we have always had the desire to have the @entity27 public see this movie , " @entity76 said			0
so far , no major video on demand distributors or streaming services have offered to carry " @entity72 " to @entity27 , @entity76 explained , despite a wave of suggestions that @entity1 distribute the film outside of movie theaters			2
and despite enduring what he called " the worst cyberattack in @entity27 history , " @entity76 said his studios would make the movie again , but may have " done some things slightly differently			2
" @entity0 added that the @entity27 has " no indication " that any other country was involved in the @entity7 attack			1
secretary of state @entity110 also sounded off on what he called a " brazen , " " provocative and unprecedented " attack			2
" we are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this state sponsored cyber-attack , " @entity110 said in a statement			0
" these lawless acts of intimidation demonstrate @entity7 's flagrant disregard for international norms			1
" sen. @entity123 said that the onus is on the government and the international community to act in the face of this cyberattack -- the latest in a string of attacks on major corporations in recent years that have also included @entity132 and @entity133			0
stressing the " monumental size " and the " extortion " aspect of the cyberattack on @entity1 , @entity123 called for an " international agreement " to confront cyber threats and said the @entity27 government needs to take action to better protect companies from those types of threats			2
" we are going for bloodshed , i believe , if we do n't stop it , " she said on @entity80			2
" i would hope that we can convince the @entity7 that this carries a very heavy price			2
" and the idea of a foreign government launching a destructive attack on an @entity27 company over an ideological matter elevated this hack to " one of the highest priority investigations we 've worked on , " one law enforcement official told @entity80			2
@entity27 officials also tell @entity80 the hackers routed the attack through servers in countries from @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity36 , even some in the @entity27 â € ‹ the hackers used common dns masking techniques to make it look like it was coming from those places , but the @entity170 and @entity18 were able to track it back to @entity7			1
@entity7 internet traffic is routed through @entity174 , which is one way they are able to hide their activity , but the @entity18 was still able to trace it back to the origin , sources tell @entity80			1
and @entity0 also addressed @entity7 's motives , noting that attacks came after a comedic , satirical movie			1
" the notion that that was a threat to them i think gives you some sense of kind of what regime we 're talking about , " @entity0 said			2
the @entity18 called @entity7 's actions " outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior " in a statement released friday and called cyberthreats " one of the gravest national security dangers			1
" the @entity18 did not use the words " terror " in their statement			0
the investigation linked the " tools " of the @entity1 hack to @entity7 cyberattacks in march 2013 against @entity205 banks and media outlets			1
former sen. @entity209 , the chairman and ceo of the @entity212 , released a statement friday after the @entity18 announcement slamming the @entity7 attacks by " cyber terrorists , bent on wreaking havoc " as a " despicable , criminal act			1
" " this situation is larger than a movie 's release or the contents of someone 's private emails , " @entity209 said			0
" this is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the @entity232 and threaten the livelihoods of thousands of @entity27 who work in the film and television industry , as well as the millions who simply choose to go to the movies			0
" related : cyberattacks skyrocket @entity240 , a @entity7 expert at the @entity241 told @entity80 that he consulted informally on the field as a favor to @entity76 , who sits on the @entity244			1
" he asked @entity244 's president if he had a @entity7 expert to speak to in order to help sort out how to handle the picture and @entity244 's president asked me to do that			1
we had a couple of brief conversations , viewed the movie and sent some comments , " he said , adding " this was not a paid consultency			0
" @entity240 said he suggested @entity1 let the @entity259 know about the film and the potential political issues involved and offered to call @entity262 , the @entity259 's envoy for @entity7 human rights			1
he said " i simply notified him of what was going on			0
" @entity262 told @entity240 the film " was an @entity27 business decision and the @entity259 does n't get involved in things like that			0
" @entity240 said he did not show @entity262 or anyone at the @entity259 the film and said he was skeptical that anyone at the @entity259 saw it			0
referring to the @entity259 , @entity240 said " their attitude was that they were glad to know about it , but it was not their role to intercede			0
" in addition to @entity262 's discussion with @entity240 , the @entity259 has acknowledged that assistant secretary for east asian affairs @entity281 spoke with @entity76 about the film , but denied he had any involvement in its script or creative direction			0
@entity259 spokeswoman said she did not know of anyone at @entity259 that screened the movie , though it is not clear still if @entity259 officials knew how the movie ended			0
" i did not come across anyone who saw the movie in advance , " spokeswoman @entity292 said in an interview thursday on @entity80 's the lead with @entity295			1
sen. @entity298 on friday said the cyberattack amounted to " an act of war " on friday and said the @entity27 should retaliate in kind with cyberwarfare			0
" this is the greatest blow to free speech that i 've seen in my lifetime probably , " @entity298 said friday on @entity305 radio station @entity304 550 's " the @entity306			0
" " we have to respond in kind			0
we have lots of capability in cyber and we ought to start cranking that up			0
" @entity298 plans to hold a cybersecurity hearing into the @entity1 hack in the first two weeks of the next @entity317 , when he takes over as the chairman of the @entity319 .			0

president @entity0 calls @entity1 's decision to cancel movie showing ' a mistake . '
the @entity18 called @entity7 's actions " outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior "
officials tell @entity80 that the hackers were routed through severs in @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity36
