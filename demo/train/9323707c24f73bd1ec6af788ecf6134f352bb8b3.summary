@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 prince was found guilty tuesday of murdering an aide at a @entity0 hotel in february , in a case prosecutors said had a sexual element			1
prince @entity9 was found guilty of both murder and grievous bodily harm in the killing of @entity13			1
@entity13 died after a severe beating left him with swelling and bruising of the brain and fractured ribs and neck			1
he also had bite marks on his face , ears and arm			0
the prince had not denied killing the aide , but said he had not intended to do so			1
he is due to be sentenced wednesday and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison			0
he did not take the stand in his own defense			0
because the prince did not deny killing @entity13 , the jury 's job was to determine if he was guilty of murder or manslaughter			1
to do that , jurors had to determine the prince 's state of mind and his intent at the time he killed @entity13			1
the jury took just over an hour and a half tuesday to reach its verdict			2
the prince -- who is both a grandson and a great - nephew of @entity4 @entity46 , since his parents are cousins -- showed no reaction as the jury 's unanimous verdict was read in court			2
police said after the verdict that the prince had shown no remorse when he was questioned about his servant 's death , instead " concocting a story " about how he died			1
" when that was found to be a pack of lies , he tried to claim diplomatic immunity , " but did not qualify for it , @entity64 of @entity0 's @entity52 told journalists outside the court tuesday			0
prosecutors said the prince 's systematic mistreatment of the victim had a sexual element			0
the bitings suffered by @entity13 were not a factor in his death , but had " an obvious sexual connotation , " prosecutor @entity72 said in his opening statement two weeks ago			2
the two men were in @entity0 earlier this year as @entity9 took in @entity79 , the @entity80 and other @entity82 cities on a long global holiday with @entity13 as his companion			2
@entity9 's lawyer , @entity85 , said in his closing argument monday that @entity9 " must live with the consequences " of having killed @entity13 , but he never intended to harm him			2
@entity88 reminded the jury that a pathologist had been unable to determine how @entity13 died but that only one of his injuries , by itself , could have killed him -- a compression of the neck , the barrister said , that could have been caused when @entity9 grabbed @entity13 briefly by the throat			1
an " awful , reprehensible , culpable act , " he said , " but an act of murder ? " @entity88 also challenged the prosecution 's assertion that the defendant and the victim had a master - servant relationship , telling the jury that the two men had " enjoyed a genuine friendship			0
" he also disputed suggestions from the prosecutor and several witnesses that the prince and his aide had a gay relationship			1
during their visit to @entity0 , the two men shared a hotel room , went shopping together and stayed out late in bars and nightclubs			0
earlier in the day , prosecutor @entity72 presented his closing argument			0
he told the jury they might consider drawing an " adverse inference " from the prince 's refusal to face questions			0
the case " cries out for an explanation , " he said , adding that the jury might care to reflect on how the prince might have answered questions about the nature of his relationship with @entity13 , why it was that he attacked him on more than one occasion , his account of what happened the night his aide died and why it was that he waited hours before informing anyone of his death			1
when he did contact authorities , @entity9 said that @entity13 had been assaulted by robbers three weeks earlier			2
he is a man , said @entity72 , " incapable of telling the truth			0
" @entity2 's @entity142 contributed to this report .			0

he admitted killing his aide , but says he did *n't* intend to
@entity13 died after a severe beating caused swelling of the brain
witnesses speculated that the prince and aide had a gay relationship , but his lawyer denies it
