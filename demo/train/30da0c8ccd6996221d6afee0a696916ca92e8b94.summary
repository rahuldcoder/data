president @entity0 responded to outrage by @entity3 leaders over revelations of alleged @entity6 spying on them by saying monday that all nations , including those expressing the strongest protests , collect intelligence on each other			1
the @entity14 news magazine @entity13 reported sunday that classified leaks by former @entity18 contractor @entity16 detailed @entity18 bugging of @entity21 offices in @entity22 and @entity23 , as well as an " electronic eavesdropping operation " that tapped into an @entity21 building in @entity26			1
mounting anger throughout @entity3 on monday included a threat by @entity30 president @entity29 to halt talks with the @entity6 on trade and other issues unless the bugging stopped			1
@entity6 and @entity21 officials are scheduled to begin talks on a proposed trans - @entity38 free trade agreement next week			1
the @entity41 will sweep its offices for electronic listening devices and other security breaches , a spokeswoman said monday			2
asked at a news conference in @entity46 about the latest leaks involving @entity16 , @entity0 said he needed more information on the specific programs cited in the @entity13 report , but made clear such spying was commonplace			1
" i guarantee you that in @entity3 capitals , there are people who are interested in , if not what i had for breakfast , at least what my talking points might be should i end up meeting with their leaders , " @entity0 said			1
" that is how intelligence services operate			0
" opinion : @entity6 intelligence community is out of control meanwhile , @entity67 president @entity66 opened the door on monday to @entity16 possibly staying in @entity67			2
the admitted @entity18 leaker has been in the international transit lounge of the @entity72 airport seeking asylum in @entity74			0
@entity16 " must stop his work aimed at harming our @entity6 partners " if he wants to stay in @entity67 , @entity66 said			2
previously , @entity66 had said @entity16 should depart the airport for his final destination , wherever it might be			0
conflicting reports emerged monday that @entity16 was seeking asylum in @entity67			0
@entity83 spokesman @entity82 was unable to provide clarity to reporters			2
" we do n't have information one way or another " about an asylum request for @entity67 , @entity82 said , later adding that @entity16 " appears to still be in @entity67 and our position is the same that he should be expelled and returned home here to the @entity6 " @entity0 said monday that @entity16 had traveled to @entity67 without a valid passport or legal papers , and he hoped that @entity72 would handle the case as it would any other travel - related matter			1
the president confirmed that the @entity6 and @entity67 have had " high - level " discussions about @entity16 , after an earlier report from @entity67 that the two nations ' top law enforcement officials were working together to resolve the situation			1
the new bugging controversy follows earlier @entity3 discontent over revelations of @entity6 surveillance of overseas e-mails related to terrorism , as well as the collection of phone records as a database for further court - approved investigation			1
@entity0 sought to distinguish between what he portrayed as normal intelligence - gathering and the specific anti-terrorism programs disclosed by @entity16 's earlier leaks to @entity119 newspaper in @entity120 and the @entity121			2
in the end , he said , @entity6 and @entity3 allies " work so closely together that there is almost no information that is not shared between our various countries			1
" @entity29 , however , said bugging of @entity21 offices went beyond the anti-terrorism programs previously revealed and must stop immediately before negotiations can go forward			1
" we know that there are systems which have to control notably for the threat against terrorism , but i do not think that this is in our embassies or in the @entity21 that this risks exist , " he said			2
@entity13 reported the allegations sunday , citing information from secret documents obtained by @entity16 and " in part seen " by the news magazine			2
in @entity26 , @entity13 says , the agency targeted the @entity145 , which houses the @entity146 and the @entity147 , the union 's main decision - making and legislative body			2
and in @entity22 , the magazine report claims , the @entity18 installed bugs in the @entity21 's building and infiltrated its computer network			1
to @entity156 , a former director of the @entity18 and @entity157 , the report reflected the reality of international spying			2
" any @entity3 who wants to go out and rend their garments with regard to international espionage should look first and find out what their governments are doing , " he told @entity160 on sunday			2
@entity0 declined to comment in - depth on the @entity13 article , saying his staff needs to analyze the report to figure out which , if any , @entity6 surveillance programs it involved			1
" when we have an answer we will make sure to provide all the information that our allies want in what exactly the allegations have been , " he said			0
describing himself as " the end user of this kind of intelligence , " @entity0 said he telephones @entity29 or @entity14 chancellor @entity187 or @entity189 prime minister @entity188 if he wants to know what they 're thinking			0
" ultimately , you know , we work so closely together that there is almost no information that is not shared between our various countries , " @entity0 said			0
' @entity196 seeks new havens reactions abroad the reports elicited particular outrage in @entity14 , where @entity13 reported that @entity18 spying had targeted telephone and internet connection data in @entity14 more than any other @entity3 nation			1
citing the @entity16 documents , the news magazine reported that an average of up to 20 million phone connections and 10 million @entity210 data connections are surveyed daily			0
@entity13 noted that the intensity of surveillance puts the @entity6 ally on par with @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217			1
@entity187 's spokesman , @entity218 , cautioned monday against taking the report as fact without further confirmation			0
" if it is , though , confirmed that diplomatic representations of the @entity21 and some @entity3 countries were spied upon , we have to say clearly : the bugging of friends is unacceptable , " @entity218 said			1
" that can not happen at all			0
we are no longer in the @entity229			0
" the @entity14 and @entity30 foreign ministries planned to meet with the @entity6 ambassadors to those countries to talk about the allegations			0
the @entity235 @entity234 called the reports " a very thorny affair , " while @entity238 president @entity237 said sunday he was " deeply worried and shocked " by the claims			0
" if the allegations prove to be true , it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on @entity21 - @entity6 relations , " he said			1
another report sunday claimed that surveillance extended beyond @entity3 offices			1

what the @entity6 has to say the @entity6 director of national intelligence 's office declined to comment sunday on specific allegations published in @entity13			1
@entity0 : pay no attention to that man we ca n't capture " the @entity6 government will respond appropriately to the @entity21 through our diplomatic channels , and through the @entity21 / @entity6 experts ' dialogue on intelligence that the @entity6 proposed several weeks ago , " the @entity269 office said in a statement			1
" we will also discuss these issues bilaterally with @entity21 member states			0
while we are not going to comment publicly on specific alleged intelligence activities , as a matter of policy , we have made clear that the @entity6 gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations			1
