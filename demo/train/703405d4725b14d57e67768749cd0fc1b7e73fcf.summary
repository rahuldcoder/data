yes , @entity0 is a scary infectious disease			1
but the first thing you should know is that it 's not very contagious -- " common sense and observation tell us that spread of the virus via coughing or sneezing is rare , if it happens at all , " the @entity1 says			2
it 's spread through frequent contact with bodily fluids and can be spread only by someone who is showing symptoms			1
so if they 're not feeling sick ... many viruses can hide in the body and spread from person to person without causing any symptoms in the people it infects			0
@entity0 is n't like that			2
" @entity0 does n't spread before someone gets sick , " dr. @entity23 , director of the @entity24 , said tuesday			1
" @entity0 does not spread ... from someone who does n't have fever and other symptoms			1
" symptoms generally occur abruptly eight to 10 days after infection , though that period can range from two to 21 days			0
as people with the ebola virus become sicker , they become more infectious , experts say			0
the virus can also spread through bodily fluids after the patient dies			1
and by ' bodily fluids , ' you mean ? blood , sweat , feces , vomit , semen and spit			1
basically any kind of fluid that comes from the body			0
people in @entity49 are avoiding hugs and handshakes because the virus can be spread through the sweat on someone 's hand			1
the uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin of their hand that would allow entry of the virus , @entity57 's dr. @entity56 says			0
but " we all have minor breaks in our skin			0
and there is a possibility that some of the virus can be transmitted that way			0
" health care providers -- or family and friends -- caring for @entity0 patients are often at the highest risk of getting sick because they are most likely to come in contact with the body fluids of sick patients , according to the @entity24			1
people with @entity0 suffer from extreme vomiting , diarrhea and high fevers , which causes sweating			2
in the later stages , they may start bleeding from their eyes , mouth or other orifices			0
ebola virus : nine things to know about the killer disease bottom line ? " this is not an airborne transmission , " said dr. @entity91 , director of the @entity24 's @entity92			0
" there needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood			1
" close contact while the ebola virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism , @entity100 says , agents such as chlorine , heat , direct sunlight , soaps and detergents can kill it			2
could @entity0 spread around the world via air travel ? while the @entity24 acknowledges it is possible for a person infected with @entity0 in @entity49 to get on a plane and arrive in another country -- which is apparently what happened in the @entity118 case -- the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low			1
that 's unless your fellow passenger is bleeding , sweating profusely or vomiting on you , of course			0
" it is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel , " the @entity126 said			0
travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoiding contact with @entity0 patients .			2

@entity0 is spread by someone who has become sickened by the virus
from there , the actual transmission occurs through contact with bodily fluids
those bodily fluids *include* sweat , blood and feces
the virus can also spread through bodily fluids after the infected *victim* dies
