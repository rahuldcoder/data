-- while there 's been no shortage of snow this winter , the barrage of winter storms has left many @entity7 cities short of one thing : salt			1
in @entity12 , record amounts of snowfall have left mayors scrambling for more salt to sprinkle on their roads and sidewalks for safety			1
the salt situation in @entity20 has been " very critical , " mayor @entity18 said			2
in a typical winter , the town 's salt silos would normally be at least three - quarters full at this time of the year , he said			1
now , they are virtually empty			0
they 've had to mix the small amounts of salt they have left with sand to try stretch resources , @entity18 said			1
mayor @entity30 of @entity31 , the second - largest city in @entity12 , said its salt shortage also has been difficult			1
a delivery of salt arrived in @entity31 on monday -- an order placed two and a half weeks ago			1
normally , salt arrives only two or three days after an order is placed			2
and the shipment is less than what the city will need , he said			0
instead of badly needed salt , the city has been " using pretty much anything and everything we can get our hands on , " including sand and liquid brine , @entity30 said			1
but the @entity50 says it has enough salt for " several storms , " noting that its commissioner , @entity53 , has been working tirelessly to acquire more resources			2
" in addition to getting salt from our normal channels , the commissioner has reached out to other companies and agencies for salt that we can obtain independently from our normal suppliers , " said @entity55 , a spokesman for the department			0
daring motorists urged to smarten up before taking on bad weather rules torpedo salt shipment while coordinating with one of its main salt suppliers , @entity55 said , the @entity12 @entity74 learned of a 40,000 - ton pile of salt in @entity77 that had not been spoken for			1
its supplier said , " if you can get a ship to take it , it 's yours , " @entity55 said			0
according to the @entity83 , also known as the @entity83 , all commercial goods transported between ports in @entity7 waters must be carried on @entity7 - flagged ships , but the @entity12 @entity74 did n't have a @entity7 - flagged barge large enough to carry all of the salt in one trip			1
a waiver of the @entity83 would have to come from the @entity7 @entity92			0
a @entity92 official said tuesday that no decision has been made on waiving the requirements of the @entity83			0
@entity55 said his department was seeking a waiver so a larger ship without a @entity7 flag could make the delivery , but he got " indications that the waiver was not going to be successful			0
" @entity0 first learned of the 40,000 - ton salt supply via @entity104			1
the @entity12 @entity74 sent a smaller @entity7 - flagged barge monday night to bring about 9,500 tons of salt to @entity12 and expects it to arrive by friday or saturday , @entity55 said			1
the barge will have to make multiple trips to carry all of the salt , possibly taking several weeks			0
@entity55 did not know if more ships would become available to help transport the salt			0
still , @entity55 says , @entity12 is well - equipped to handle any winter weather			1
" clearly we want the salt , we 'd like it as quickly as possible , but we have enough salt on hand , " he said			0
some cities are close to their snowiest winter in history shortages in other areas @entity20 gov. @entity122 said this month that the long , snowy winter had left @entity124 and @entity125 with salt shortages as well , prompting the state @entity50 to move 3,500 tons of road salt to those areas from state stockpiles , according to a statement			1
the state is also mixing sand with salt to stretch resources , a @entity122 spokesman said			1
@entity136 has gone beyond @entity7 borders in its quest for more salt , receiving shipments from as far away as @entity141 , according to a tweet from @entity0 affiliate @entity143			0
the scramble for salt has led many in other states to turn to alternatives to keep roads safe , with some methods of snow and ice removal proving to be cheaper than traditional salt			1
in @entity157 , @entity154 , cheese brine from factories is used for snow and ice control , said @entity160 , program manager at the @entity161			2
" cheese brine is not an alternative to salt , it 's just a cheaper version , " he said , adding that it 's mixed with salt to conserve supplies			2
" in @entity154 , it 's a waste product			0
for us , it can be used on the roads			0
someone can give it to us			0
we ask them to filter and deliver it , and we use it			0
... we 're doing them a favor			0
it 's just another material that we can use with salt to treat the snow and ice that 's supposed to be close to free			2
" the brine is effective because it works at a lower temperature than normal salt , said @entity188 , technical support manager at the @entity189			2
in 2011 , @entity191 , @entity12 , officials used a mixture of salt and water that resembles pickle juice and costs significantly less than salt , former county public works director @entity198 told @entity0 affiliate @entity200			1
the county also had an exceptionally snowy winter this year			0
other alternatives to salt have included liquid byproducts , including beer waste and beet juice , according to a study by the @entity208 , a @entity209 - based environmental group			2
some communities are dealing with high costs for both salt and overtime for plow drivers			2
in @entity217 , @entity216 , salt is three times the normal price because of high demand this winter , and overtime for plow workers is adding up			0
the @entity12 @entity74 reports that it has spent more than $ 82 million for snow and ice removal through february 11 of this year , compared with $ 62 million spent all of last year 's winter season			1
even before the last storm , more than 372,000 tons of salt had been used in @entity12 this winter , compared with " last year 's 258,000 tons for the whole winter , " @entity55 said			1
5 reasons climate change is back in the news @entity0 's @entity232 , @entity233 , and @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
