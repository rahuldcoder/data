-- it was cute for a while			2
and a few @entity5 even learned to locate @entity6 on a map			0
( i think it 's near @entity10			0
) but now it 's time for all of us to come together and stop the madness			0
thus , let it be known that i hereby declare october 12 , 2012 , as the day " @entity15 " died			1
it 's officially no longer a thing			0
@entity19 seems like a really good dude , and i hate to have done this to his song , but this morning i slowly walked " @entity15 " out into the backyard , thanked it for the good times and shot it			1
" @entity27 is @entity29 style ! " k - pop star @entity19 : my video 's more popular than me ! the last straw came for me when i was searching the web for interesting writing topics and stumbled upon yet another trending video of a group dance using this song			1
too many people thought this mattered , and i just could n't take it			0
right then and there , i experienced what some people in the medical community might describe as a mild freakout			0
so , let me just give a big thanks to the random stranger who pulled my shaking , half - naked body out of the storm gutter near my house			0
actually , that was last week and totally unrelated			0
but , nevertheless , thanks			0
@entity53 : @entity15 from @entity54 now , before i go any further , i probably need to stop and explain " @entity15 " to my mom and dad , who , at this moment , are completely lost			1
" honey , do you have any idea what @entity60 's talking about ? " " shhhh			0
" basically , @entity64 , " @entity15 " is a fun , catchy pop song by @entity6 artist @entity19			1
the official music video debuted on @entity68 on july 15 , went crazy viral and has since earned more than 430 million views			2
that said , dear parents , " @entity15 " is more than just a song			1
it 's also a dance ( sort of ) whose main signature move can best be described as riding a horse or , perhaps , fornicating with a kangaroo			2
so , you know , enjoy that little visual , and i 'll see you at @entity82			0
as for the title : it actually refers to a posh district in @entity86 where people are considered trendy and lavish , and the video colorfully exaggerates this uber - affluent lifestyle			2
in other words , one might say @entity91 is @entity15			1
( though there does appear to be a @entity92 in @entity91 , @entity94			0
) for historical comparison , at least in my lifetime , i suppose the closest thing we 've ever had to " @entity15 " was " @entity101 " by @entity100			1
while the song " @entity101 " -- and its signature dance , @entity101 -- did n't enjoy the luxury of @entity68 , it did somehow manage to become an international sensation in the mid- ' 90s			1
if you were at a party or a sporting event or ( seriously ) even the @entity110 , you were ( by penalty of death ) required to dance the @entity101			1
and to this day , i still know it by heart			2
@entity116 video evokes ' @entity15 ' to taunt @entity6 candidate mind you , i can barely remember what i was doing 30 seconds ago , but even after more than 15 years , i absolutely , positively recall every last move of the @entity101			1
just to be sure , i demonstrated it for our 23 - year - old intern and then asked if she 'd like me to teach it to her			0
her wise response : " do i have to ? " so we 've long since rid ourselves of " @entity101 , " and now we say goodbye to " @entity15			1
" they 're not a perfect comparison , for as best as i can tell , " @entity15 " is n't necessarily a fully composed dance but more of a song that features several signature dance moves			1
i already described the main one , and the other biggie looks like some sort of crazed , hyper - animated version of the @entity137			0
well , at least from back in the day when the @entity138 frontman did n't have to move around stage on a @entity141			2
the point is this : " @entity15 " is officially dead			1
true , the @entity143 did n't grant me absolute authority to murder it in the backyard , but i assure you it 's taken care of			0
so , no more group dancing			2
alas , i wish this old boy could 've been put out to stud , but for the safety of future generations , " @entity15 " simply had to die			1
it wo n't see you at @entity82 .			0

i hereby declare october 12 , 2012 , as the day " @entity15 " died
the last straw was when i came upon yet another trending video of a group dance to this song
we 've long since rid ourselves of " @entity101 , " so we say can goodbye to " @entity15 " ?
