in the spring of 2003 , software developer @entity3 was 39 years old and near the top of the heap at @entity8 , sitting at conference tables with @entity10 and " managing people who managed people who managed people , " as she puts it			1
" i ca n't be in another meeting where people just get yelled at , " she explained in her exit interview			2
@entity3 spent a few months teaching yoga and living off her savings , she says , " but i did n't know what the next thing was going to be , which was a little scary			1
" one day a rock - climbing buddy mentioned a class he 'd been taking in circus aerials : the kind of midair acrobatics perfected by @entity27			1
@entity3 tried a session and was instantly hooked -- even obsessed			1
she traveled to @entity29 , @entity30 , for months of training with @entity32 and the @entity33			0
( " my teacher was a lovely old @entity35 lady who liked me because i was n't 20			0
" ) once back in @entity36 , she started performing and teaching with a small troupe			1
" aerials are a way to exercise that 's fun and creative and social -- even more so than your average dance or yoga class , " she says			2
beginners might get the heebie - jeebies watching @entity3 shimmy 30 feet up a silk banner to dance , spin , and tumble in thin air			1
but aerials can be done by people of all ages and abilities -- at least when @entity3 is your instructor			1
your great idea , whose time has come " if students ca n't manage a skill , i will find one they can do , so everyone walks out of the room feeling good , " she says			2

there have been very few people i could n't get up a rope			0
" by 2007 @entity3 's classes were so popular -- particularly with women in their early 20s to mid- 40s -- that she founded @entity73 , @entity36 's first full - time aerial studio			1
" i never wanted to take the risk of starting a business , " says @entity3 , who teaches six group sessions a week and tutors students privately			1
" yet here i am			0
i 've accidentally created a community : people come for their classes , but they also drop by to see their friends and help each other			0
" how to find happiness at work she has also accidentally transformed herself			0
" i used to think of myself as the person who gets stuff done , not the person who comes up with the ideas , " she explains			0
" i cooked from recipes and sewed from patterns			0
so the first time i created a performance routine that seemed interesting and creative and graceful -- that was a revelation			2
even now , when i hear a song on the radio and start thinking of choreography , or when i cook a meal based on whatever 's in the fridge , i 'm aware that i 've changed			2
