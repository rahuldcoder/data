as president @entity0 battles slumping poll numbers and multiple world crises , twice in the past few days he has laid part of the blame for an anxious public at the feet of the media			1
while he 's not the first president to fault some of his problems on journalists , he has added a new twist to the argument			1
monday at a @entity14 event in @entity15 the president touted some of the positive economic news the nation has seen adding : " so , look , i 'm saying all this just because sometimes , you know , if you 're watching tv , it 's just kind of a whole downer			1
now , we 've got struggles			0
we 've got work to do			0
but there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about @entity31			0
" on friday he also discussed why the public feels so anxious about the economy despite recovery from the great recession and declining unemployment numbers			1
he told a @entity39 fundraiser in @entity40 , @entity41 , some of those reasons for the uneasiness include those still unable to find a job and slower growth in wages and incomes			0
but then he turned to the media and its impact			0
" second reason people are feeling anxious is that if you watch the nightly news , it feels like the world is falling apart			1
" @entity0 acknowledged , " we are living through some extraordinarily challenging times			2
a lot of it has to do with changes that are taking place in the @entity63 in which an old order that had been in place for 50 years , 60 years , 100 years was unsustainable , and was going to break up at some point			0
" but at the same time he blamed the explosion of social media for accentuating this concern			2
" the truth of the matter is , is that the world has always been messy			0
in part , we 're just noticing now because of social media and our capacity to see in intimate detail the hardships that people are going through			2
the good news is that @entity31 leadership has never been more necessary , and there 's really no competition out there for the ideas and the values that can create the sort of order that we need in this world			1
" these are not the first times the president has played media critic			2
in 2012 while discussing descriptions of his image as aloof , he told @entity96 , " my suspicion is that this whole critique has to do with the fact that i do n't go to a lot of @entity102 parties and , as a consequence , the @entity102 press corps maybe just does n't feel like i 'm in the mix enough with them , and they figure , well , if i 'm not spending time with them , i must be cold and aloof			1
" also in 2012 during a commencement speech at @entity110 he told the students : " no wonder that faith in our institutions has never been lower , particularly when good news does n't get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore			1
every day you receive a steady stream of sensationalism and scandal and stories with a message that suggest change is n't possible ; that you ca n't make a difference ; that you wo n't be able to close that gap between life as it is and life as you want it to be			0
" and in 2013 he said in an interview with the @entity134 that " one of the biggest factors is going to be how the media shapes debates " while talking about whether some @entity139 would work with the @entity140 .			0

president @entity0 said monday , " if you 're watching tv , it 's just kind of a whole downer "
" if you watch the nightly news , it feels like the world is falling apart , " he said friday .
this is n't the first time @entity0 has been a media critics
" good news does n't get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore , " he said in 2012
