-- @entity2 's supporters say she is being prosecuted because she was in a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex			1
authorities say it is n't a gay rights issue at all , but rather a simple case of an adult inappropriately involved with a minor			2
as public outrage mounts , fueled by @entity13 activism , 18 - year - old @entity2 has until friday to decide whether she 'll accept a plea deal or go to trial for her relationship with a 14 - year - old schoolmate			1
@entity2 is charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery in the relationship that the young woman and her parents say was consensual			2
the students attended @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , while some of the 150,000 people signing an online petition asking prosecutors to drop the case have suggested that it 's being handled differently because it involves a same - sex relationship , @entity29 sheriff @entity28 said that has nothing to do with it			1
" if this was an 18 - year - old male and that was a 14 - year - old girl , it would have been prosecuted the same way , " he said			1
@entity0 legal analyst @entity45 concurs , saying whether the people involved are same - sex or opposite - sex , the legal issues are the same			2
" a kid , a child under the age of 16 , can not consent to having sexual relations with an 18 - year - old , an adult under the eyes of the law , " she said			1
" and that really is all this case comes down to when you look at it legally			0
" the @entity59 has offered a plea deal that would reduce the charges to third - degree child abuse			1
as part of the package , she would get a year of probation and two years of monitoring , meaning she would have to wear an ankle bracelet			2
it would be up to a judge to decide if she would be labeled a felon as she moves forward in life			0

" @entity85 , an attorney for the 14 - year - old , told @entity0 affiliate @entity87 that the plea deal is fair			1
" it takes into account the seriousness of the offense			0
it takes into account that it 's a violation of @entity27 law , " he said			1
" the plea offer allows her to enter a plea that she will not go to jail and she will not be labeled as a sex offender , so there 's no argument that her life is being ruined by this plea offer			2
" a sometimes tearful @entity2 said the whole thing frightens her			0
" i 'm scared of losing my life , the rest of my life , and not being able to go to college or be around kids , be around my sisters and my family , " she said , acknowledging the whirlwind that has surrounded her since the family went public with the story			0
