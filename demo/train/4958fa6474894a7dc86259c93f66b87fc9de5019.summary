it 's no secret that fertility treatments are behind the increasing numbers of twins , triplets or even quadruplets or quintuplets born in recent years			1
however , scientists studying the impact of medical intervention on multiple births were in for a surprise -- in vitro fertilization ( @entity13 ) , which has anecdotally borne much of the blame for multiple births because more than one embryo is typically implanted , was not the primary cause of multiples			1
instead , fertility drugs appear to be the culprit			1
by 2011 , 36 % of twin births and 77 % of triplets , quads and quintuplets came as a result of fertility treatments including fertility drugs , according to a study published this week in the @entity29			1
" we were surprised that @entity36 approaches were more culpable than @entity13 here , " said dr. @entity30 , a professor of medical science at the @entity32 of @entity33			1
he and his colleagues initiated the study because they wanted to find a way to stop the multiples trend			2
why ? doctors prefer women give birth to a single baby or a " singleton " as they are called in medical lingo			0
that 's because even with medical advances , multiple births are still considered risky for both mother and babies			2
top misconceptions about fertility treatments " by and large , human reproduction is designed for singletons , and the optimum outcome we hope for is a singleton birth to term , " @entity30 said			1
" when you get into a situation with multiple and higher number births , all kinds of concerns creep in			0
we wanted to make a deliberate course correction as opposed to flailing indiscriminately at the problem			0
" while doctors recognized the phenomenon was a public health issue , @entity30 said , " we did n't really have the hard numbers and we certainly did not have the kind of detailed insights into what 's driving the increase in the number of multiples			0
" researchers arrived at these details by studying the number of times women gave birth to multiples between 1962 and 1966 -- the era before fertility treatments			1
they contrasted this data with the number of multiple births between 1971 to 2011			0
all births are tracked by the @entity89			0
by law , all children born as a result of @entity13 are also tracked by a national registry			1
children born as a result of some other fertility treatment , such as the use of fertility drugs , are not tracked , so researchers estimated that number			1
what they found , adjusting for maternal age and the national rate of twin births , was that the number of twins increased slightly , by a factor of 1.9 between 1971 to 2009			0
the number of triplets and higher - order births increased by a much larger number -- they were up by a factor of 6.7 from 1971 to 1998			2
thankfully , @entity30 said , that number peaked in 1998			2
that may in large part be due to doctors following guidelines issued that year by the @entity119			1
those guidelines encouraged doctors to limit the number of embryos transferred during an ivf procedure			2
doctors routinely transfer multiple embryos to increase the likelihood that at least one will result in a pregnancy			0
since these guidelines went into effect there has been a 70 % reduction in the transfer of three or more embryos during @entity13 , according to the study			1
that has in part resulted in a 33 % decrease in the proportion of triplet and higher - order births due to @entity13			1
egg freezing changing fertility treatments " maybe the worst is behind us in this epidemic of multiple births , when it comes to @entity13 at least , " @entity30 said			1
however , @entity36 fertility treatments such as fertility drugs still are causing a disproportionate number of multiple births			1
in such treatments , a woman will take drugs that will encourage her ovaries to release more than one egg a month			2
the rate of @entity36 twin births has increased slightly , going from 16 % in 1998 to 19 % in 2011 , according to the study			2
@entity156 triplet births increased from 36 % to 45 % in the same time period			1
" that 's a lot and there is certainly room for improvement there , " said dr. @entity158 , a fellow at the @entity159			0
" because of limited insurance coverage , we see that patients currently have a financial disincentive to go the @entity13 route , which means they are leaving this up to chance			0
" women struggling with infertility may choose the fertility drug route first because it is cheaper			0
often insurance does not cover @entity13 or caps reimbursement			0
with this new data , legislators may want to encourage more insurance companies to cover @entity13 treatments			2
some states do mandate coverage			0
teacher who was fired after fertility treatments sues diocese " there are clearly ways by which these @entity36 technologies can be modified and there are more prudent approaches that result in less in the way of multiples , " @entity30 said			1
he believes education is key to help doctors and their patients understand the negative health impacts of giving birth to multiple children			0
@entity30 said he and others plan to continue to watch this multiple birth trend			0
" hopefully by conducting these types of analyses , we should have a good handle on what is happening in this area , " he said			0
" we want to see if we will be gaining in success at limiting the number of multiple births or , @entity210 forbid , we are losing the battle			0

36 % of twins , 77 % of triplets , other multiples came from fertility treatments in 2011
more multiples are the result of the mother taking fertility drugs rather than having @entity13
the ivf induced triplet trend peaked in 1998 due in part to new medical guidelines
