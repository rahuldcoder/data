-- as things have been going for @entity2 lately , wednesday could easily go down as the best day yet for the new government of @entity4			1
topped by a high - profile @entity7 visit , it was a welcome distraction from a string of humiliations and provocations from @entity13 -- not least of which was the creeping occupation of the @entity16			0
if @entity4 left @entity18 dissatisfied , he clearly was n't showing it			1
the visit brought promises of $ 1 billion of desperately needed loan guarantees , an immediate surge in @entity23 bilateral assistance that ranges from a doubling of support for the may 25 presidential elections to increased academic scholarships and even @entity28 to eat ( @entity29 ) for the @entity2 military			1
read more : @entity32 committee approves @entity2 aid package , @entity13 sanctions @entity18 's overtures came as the @entity37 group of nations and the @entity39 rallied to throw additional support to a beleaguered @entity2			1
aside from strong talk of more sanctions for @entity13 -- should a referendum branded illegal by the @entity44 and @entity2 go ahead this weekend -- there were gifts of $ 685 - million in trade benefits from @entity48 and hints of an accelerated signing of an @entity51 after presidential elections			1
yet , despite all that , @entity4 , one of the most polished and articulate @entity2 politicians of this generation , hinted that his new government is going to have to deal with autonomy demands -- both present and future - from pro-russian regions			1
" we need to start a nationwide dialogue on the autonomy of @entity16 , " @entity4 said at an @entity60 speech in @entity18			1
but he added that there are no legal grounds for sunday 's referendum -- a referendum that he and the @entity44 see as a rogue act backed by @entity58 thugs and a show of brute and unprovoked military force			2
" this is an illegitimate , unconstitutional referendum , " @entity4 said , echoing the talking points heard from the corridors of power in @entity74 , @entity48 and @entity75			2
to his credit , @entity4 and @entity2 president @entity77 have , so far , come across as a national unity government of peace and reconciliation			1
as @entity4 correctly noted , @entity82 has resisted @entity13 provocations and has made real conciliatory gestures to the @entity13 majority in the east and south - for example not backing legislation limiting the use of the @entity13 language at the administrative - regional level			2
to say that the stakes are high is almost an understatement			0
with @entity13 military might also amassing on @entity2 's eastern borders there was talk of the region even descending into a quagmire equal to that of " another @entity101			1
" history of @entity44 promises while the arrival of an unprecedented tide of @entity44 support and rhetorical embrace has been received with glee in @entity2 , it is undeniable that the history of @entity44 promises has been less than stellar			1
as one @entity113 member pointed out wednesday , not one international pledging conference for @entity111 has ever met its goal			0
@entity115 too that the @entity44 is acting only now , with @entity2 on the precipice and when @entity44 experts have been warning for years that @entity118 has long since been developing separatist scenarios			1
and if the sentiments of ordinary @entity2 in the @entity122 are anything to go by , @entity44 assistance has come too late			1
" any moment @entity118 could land a helicopter in here and destroy us , " said a pensioner from @entity125 who was tending his tent friday morning on the fringes of @entity122			0
said another @entity122 protester from western @entity2 : " what was promised does n't make any difference to me			2
they 've promised in the past and then what ? " the precedent being set by the holding of a @entity16 referendum is surely the main reason for the panic from the @entity142 to @entity143			2
brazen land grab in his @entity60 discussion , @entity4 was asked how confident he was of receiving the @entity44 support being promised to him			1
@entity4 said the issue was one of global security			0
he cited the @entity150 -- inked by the @entity23 , @entity151 , @entity2 and @entity13 -- which guaranteed @entity2 's territorial integrity in return for the dismantling of its massive @entity156 - era nuclear arsenal			1
" we executed this memorandum , " he said			0
" and today we ask for the protection			0
if we do n't get this protection , tell me the way how the world is to reinforce or ask another countries to stop their nuclear programs			0
" of course there are other international legal provisions which should prevent @entity13 from grabbing @entity2 territory ; these include the provisions of the @entity169 ( @entity171 ) treaty and the @entity172			0
but , as with the @entity150 , there are n't any clear enforcement mechanisms			0
international legal experts say they are hardly surprised by the @entity177 's brazen land grab , pointing to what seems a long - term policy of strategic separatism in the @entity181			0
@entity182 , a past fellow of the @entity184 @entity183 , said that aside from violating national and international laws , the @entity16 referendum is being held under the duress of @entity13 military occupation			0
" the referendum , if recognized , will deface non-proliferation and support illegal @entity13 operations elsewhere , " says @entity182			0
@entity118 says @entity13 's actions fall within the scope of the @entity194 between @entity2 and the @entity13			2
but with @entity13 apparently in operational control of the @entity16 it 's absurd to claim @entity2 's territorial integrity has been respected			1
at the end of the day , it will be the actions of greater powers that will determine whether @entity118 blinks over his @entity16 strategy			0
with talk of suspending @entity13 's membership of the @entity205 and even of barring its participation in the @entity207 , the @entity177 could decide to back down			0
but with @entity118 being quoted as saying such nonsense as @entity2 did not leave the @entity210 in a legal way , it is anyone 's guess what might happen next			2
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

@entity2 's interim *pm* @entity4 visited @entity18 and the @entity142 this week
he left with promises of loan guarantees , bilateral assistance as @entity39 nations also rallied
@entity217 says it 's curious the @entity44 is only acting now @entity2 is on the precipice
he says @entity44 assistance may have come too late and it 's *unclear* what will happen
