-- @entity2 prosecutors are asking a court to formally exonerate a @entity5 man after dna tests ruled out his guilt in a rape for which he served 17 years in prison			1
@entity10 was freed in 2004 after an appeals court found that faulty scientific evidence had been used against him in his 1987 trial			1
prosecutors did n't retry him , citing concerns about having the victim -- who had identified @entity10 as one of her two attackers in a police lineup -- testify again			1
state officials had denied his request for a pardon , but @entity23 district attorney @entity22 agreed to review his case after she took office in 2009			0
new dna tests on the forensic evidence in the case came back february 22 and conclusively ruled out @entity10 , now 50 , @entity22 said in a statement wednesday afternoon			1
" when this scientific inquiry began , there was no legal requirement or mandate for any further work to be done by our office , because the case had been dismissed , " @entity22 said			0
" instead , we acted on the most important obligation of all -- to see that the truth emerges , and that justice is done			0
today , we can state that an innocent man has been vindicated			0
" the @entity23 district attorney 's office will ask a judge to formally declare @entity10 innocent at a thursday hearing , she said			1
@entity22 , a @entity47 , campaigned on promises to reform the prosecutor 's office in @entity5 ' largest city , and she has drawn praise from defense lawyers for creating a post-conviction review process to examine new evidence			0
the @entity56 , which won @entity10 's release in 2004 , gave her an award in 2010 for that program			2
another man , @entity60 , is now serving a 60 - year prison term in connection for rape			2
the dna testing also confirmed that another man , now dead but long considered an alternative suspect , also assaulted the victim , who was 14 at the time .			0

@entity10 was released in 2004 but never formally cleared
prosecutors say dna tests rule out his *participation* in the 1987 rape
