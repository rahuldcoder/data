interrogators do n't expect to have it easy with @entity2 , a @entity4 law enforcement official told @entity5			1
the suspected mastermind of the 2012 attack on the @entity10 mission in @entity11 , @entity12 , has had time to rehearse his story , the official said			1
but an expert who has interrogated @entity17 operatives thinks there 's a good chance @entity2 will crack , if interrogators punch the right buttons			1
others have done so before him			2
" some were motivated by the uncertainty of the situations			2
others were motivated , as they called it , ( by ) fatigue with the jihad life , " former @entity25 intelligence agent @entity24 said			1
what 's next ? the capture months of intelligence research went into @entity2 's capture , gen. @entity32 , chairman of the @entity33 , said wednesday night			1
then @entity36 slipped into @entity12 by sea over the weekend to nab him			2
with @entity41 agents by their sides , the @entity36 operatives headed to a villa south of @entity11 , a senior law enforcement official said			1
there , they set a trap and lured @entity2			2
he fell for it , and they delivered him by boat to the @entity49			1
they also confiscated some " media " at the villa , which investigators will scrutinize			1
high seas ' a good place ' interrogators from the @entity41 - led @entity57 are on board the ship			1
taking @entity2 by sea , rather than by air , is giving them " maximum time to question him , " @entity10 officials said			1
the high seas are a good place for it to happen , @entity65 said			1
" it really is quite conducive to good interviews			1
" " the main thing is to get the detainee , the subject , to a safe environment with a minimum of distractions			2
" first they 'll let a doctor check him over to make sure he was n't injured when he was captured			0
that should go quickly and easily , he said			0
@entity2 only wrestled with @entity10 forces briefly			0
not a shot was fired when they captured him			0
after the medical , it 's time to meet the interrogators			1
@entity65 says they should prioritize information that improves national security , like tips that help disrupt plots			1
they should also get a roster of terrorist players and the lowdown on how they communicate			0
logistical reasons the sea transport is also being done for logistical reasons			0
the @entity10 would have a hard time finding countries in the region willing to allow the ship to transfer a prisoner snatched in an operation such as this			1
the @entity12 government has decried his capture as a " kidnapping " that violated its territorial sovereignty			0
@entity12 justice minister @entity110 said the @entity10 is still a friend of @entity12 's , but he called for @entity10 officials to loop his government in before carrying out such operations			0
the @entity12 government asked that the @entity10 guarantee the suspect 's safety and rights			2
@entity118 joined that call wednesday , asking that @entity2 get access to a lawyer and appear promptly before a judge			0
they demanded he receive a fair trial			0
about that trial once the @entity49 has neared @entity10 shores , officials will put @entity2 into a helicopter and fly him onto land			1
the @entity130 administration has said he will face a federal trial , a position at odds with some of the president 's @entity135 critics , some of them calling for @entity2 to be incarcerated at the @entity10 military detention facility in @entity139 , @entity140			0
prosecutors have had a lot of success with terror trials in @entity10 civilian courts			2
aspiring @entity147 bomber @entity146 , the so - called underwear bomber @entity146 , radical cleric @entity149 and @entity17 propagandist @entity150 -- all were convicted and sentenced in @entity10 courts			0
and they are but a few examples			0
by contrast , there have been a mere handful of @entity139 convictions			0
@entity2 might tell the court the same story about why he was at the @entity10 mission the day a mob attacked it , killing ambassador @entity163 and it expert @entity164			0
" i did n't know where the place was , " he told @entity5 last year			2
" when i heard , we went to examine the situation			0
when we withdrew and there was shooting with medium guns , and there were @entity172 in the air and people panicked , we tried to control traffic			0
" but @entity10 investigators have collected evidence against him for two years , and the accused will be tried on three charges in federal court that include killing while attacking a federal facility and material support of terrorism			1
a formal indictment is around the corner , @entity10 officials said , and it will include some new charges			0
opinion : why @entity10 raid in @entity12 is a sign of hope opinion : why @entity11 issue wo n't go away @entity11 attack time line lawmaker : if @entity5 can interview @entity2 , why ca n't @entity41 ?			2

terror suspect @entity197 is being held on the @entity49
interrogators will get lots of time to squeeze him for fresh terrorism intelligence
former intel official : investigators should press him for details on plots
the high seas are a good place to get him to open up , the former official said
