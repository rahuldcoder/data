-- @entity1 is announcing today that it has integrated @entity2 and @entity3 , bringing the streams of millions of @entity2 users into inboxes across the world			1
last year , @entity1 launched @entity8 , a plugin that syncs social networking feeds with your outlook contacts , giving you immediate data on what they are doing and thinking			1
it started last year with @entity17 integration , but soon the company announced @entity19 and @entity2 were coming			2
today , @entity20 completes the cycle with not only @entity2 integration , but support for @entity3 as well			0
not only that , but the company is releasing the plugin for @entity20 and 2007 users as well , bringing @entity2 , @entity19 , @entity17 and @entity3 to millions of business and personal inboxes worldwide			0
last week , we got a sneak peek at the new outlook at @entity1 's headquarters in @entity33 , @entity34			0
here 's what you can expect from the new @entity2 integration , as well some features that you can expect in the near future : @entity2 @entity2 and @entity1 worked together to get the launch of @entity2 's integration in @entity8 right			1
@entity2 's strategic partner manager @entity44 told us that they worked closely with the office team to make the experience more social			1
one of the things he immediately highlighted was the pulling of @entity2 profile pictures into @entity20			0
the entire experience is a step above the @entity17 integration , which itself was pretty strong			0
not only does it pull @entity2 profile photos so that you can associate a name to a face , but it pulls the news feeds of your contacts into your inbox			1
when you 're looking at someone 's e-mail , you 'll also get a glance at their status updates , picture uploads and wall posts , among other activities			1
when you combine that with @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity3 , and outlook data , you get a very detailed history of your interaction with your contacts , as well as an at - a - glance look at their activities and interests			2
knowing that a potential client just returned from a trip to @entity80 can be all that you need to have the upper hand against your competition			0
@entity84 product manager @entity83 told us that there 's another new feature to the @entity2 integration : realtime updates			1
thanks to a new update to the social connector platform , also being released today , updates from your contacts will automatically be pushed to your inbox			2
there 's no need to refresh anything : new @entity2 status updates will pop up in realtime within @entity20			1
the @entity2 integration does have limitations , though : except for friend requests , @entity20 can only pull data from @entity2			1
there is no " liking " posts or updating your status via @entity20 , at least right now			0
@entity1 says that the next step is to provide a richer social experience by integrating the ability to push data to other social networks , improving the look and feel of @entity8 , and adding other social networks from other regions			1
the @entity115 @entity1 has known for a while that social technologies are going to dominate the web			0
that was made evident by its $ 240 million stake in @entity2 and its many partnerships and attempts at social media ( some of which have bombed )			2
however , @entity8 has always felt like one of the company 's smarter social media plays			2
@entity2 's @entity128 probably put it best : " what 's unique is that it 's bringing social elements and context from @entity2 form your colleagues and your friends into the @entity20 experience , which is pretty unique given that there are so many that use @entity20 as their primary communiction tool			2
" e-mail is n't inherently a " social " experience ( it 's not a one - to - many platform ) , and attempts at integrating social into the inbox ( think @entity148 ) have mostly fallen flat			0
however , social data can be incredibly useful in the business world , especially when you need to understand what your client or colleague is thinking or doing right now			0
while we 'd still love to see @entity156 integration in @entity20 , @entity2 is far larger and , in most cases , has far more useful information			0
@entity1 's also learned a few lessons from the privacy fiascos @entity2 and @entity161 have undergone in recent months			0
@entity20 will only pull data from e-mails connected to @entity2 accounts			1
if your business e-mail is n't linked to your @entity2 , your data stream wo n't appear in @entity8			1
it gives users a choice , although most people do choose to add their work e-mails to @entity2 in order to join their company 's @entity2 network			2
if you want to learn more about the announcement , @entity1 has also released a short video articulating @entity20 's new features			0
