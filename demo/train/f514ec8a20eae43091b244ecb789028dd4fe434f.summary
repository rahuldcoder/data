-- a federal appeals court offered dramatically different views on tuesday over the constitutionality and scope of @entity6 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage			1
the @entity6 petition and similar ones across the county confront a questioned unanswered by the @entity12 @entity11 : whether the @entity13 guarantees equal protection for same - sex civil marriage			1
a ruling from the three - judge panel of 4th @entity18 could perhaps come as early as next month			2
it would affect marriage laws in those states within the court 's jurisdiction : @entity6 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
only @entity24 has legalized same - sex marriage			2
a federal judge in february struck down @entity6 's ban on constitutional grounds , the first time that had been done in a traditionally southern state			1
@entity34 formalized in 2006 the prohibition has effectively been in place since colonial days , but only incorporated into the state 's constitution in 2006			0
that ruling continued a near - unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year , giving marriage - equality supporters unbridled encouragement that their ultimate goal will be achieved : striking all laws limiting the rights of homosexuals to wed. a state judge in @entity51 on friday struck down a similar prohibition , and same - sex couples in @entity54 had lined up over the weekend to get marriage licenses			1
gay and lesbian couples in @entity6 can not marry in the state until the current case is fully resolved			2
that may not happen until the @entity11 decides whether to review the constitutional issues pending in several states , a process that may not begin at the earliest until later this year			1
@entity11 asked to defer to voters what the three judges in @entity66 seemed to agree on tuesday was that both sides of the issue were using the intermediate court as " way - station up ( @entity72 ) 95 " to the @entity11 , where the social , political , and legal debate will ultimately and almost certainly be resolved			1
in the 70 - minute argument , lawyers opposing same - sex marriage urged the judges to defer the issue to voters and " the democratic process			1
" @entity80 of the @entity81 said procreation and stable families were a key component of state laws supporting " traditional " marriage between one man and one woman			0
judges weigh in but judge @entity90 repeatedly pressed counsel to explain why loving gay and lesbian couples should be treated differently , saying those arguments were " disingenuous			0
" " you can be in prison and still get married			0
yet because of a person 's sexual orientation , ( gay couples ) ca n't marry , " said @entity90 , who was appointed by @entity97			0
" that sounds like a totalitarian system " opponents of same - sex marriage were advocating			0
but judge @entity106 suggested because the idea of same - sex marriage is a relatively recent issue in the courts and public consciousness , states could recognize gay and lesbian couples as " @entity114 , " different from the long - held concept of marriage between opposite sex couples			1
he questioned whether this " brand new relationship " is fundamental to constitutional protection , or something states should have the discretion to address as they see fit			2
the third member of the panel , judge @entity123 , named to the court by president @entity126 , asked few questions and his vote could swing the outcome			0
' second class relationship ' @entity131 , among a group of lawyers representing the same - sex plaintiffs , told the court the state 's law viewed his clients as being in a " second class relationship			0
" @entity6 's governor and attorney general , sworn into office in january , have reversed course from previous administrations and say they will not defend the current ban			1
" i concluded that based on precedent marriage is a fundamental right protected by the @entity13 , " said @entity6 attorney general @entity147			2
other states have also refused to defend current bans , including @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , and @entity155			0
seventeen states and the @entity157 allow same - sex marriage within its borders : @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity24 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , and @entity157			2
@entity167 on saturday will mark the 10th anniversary becoming the first state to legally wed gay and lesbian couples			0
a separate federal appeals court last month heard challenges to same - sex marriage bans in @entity181 and @entity182			0
appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar lawsuits over current bans in @entity153 , @entity186 , @entity152 , @entity187 , and @entity188			0
' equality for all @entity190 ' the challenge to @entity6 's ban was brought by several plaintiffs , including @entity194 and @entity195 of @entity196			1
" the time has come for us and our state " to recognize same - sex marriage , said @entity194 after the court session			0
" we truly want equality for all @entity190			0
" also bringing suit are two @entity66 - area women , whose marriage was formalized in @entity160 , but is not recognized in the commonwealth			1
" i continue to be raised in a loving family , " said @entity207 , the 16 - year old daughter of @entity208 and her partner @entity209 , who have been together nearly three decades			0
" these are my two moms and this is my family			0
" supporters of traditional marriage between one - man and one - woman have criticized the rulings in @entity6 and other states , for expanding the right to homosexuals			1
" it appears that we have yet another example of an arrogant judge substituting her personal preferences for the judgment of the @entity229 and 57 percent of @entity6 voters , " said @entity221 , president of the conservative @entity222			2
@entity11 rulings last june , the @entity12 @entity11 cleared the way for same - sex marriages in @entity160 to resume after it ruled private parties did not have " standing " to defend a voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			2
more importantly , the high court also rejected parts of the @entity241 in its 5 - 4 " @entity243 " decision , citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits , such as tax breaks			1
various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 70 pending marriage equality lawsuits in about 30 states			0
as far as the broader constitutional issues that have a chance of being heard by the @entity12 @entity11 in the next year or so , this week 's @entity6 case stands out -- if only because of history			1
it was an appeal of the so - called " @entity259 " case from @entity6 in the late 1960 's that led the justices to unanimously declare inter-racial marriage the law of the land .			1
