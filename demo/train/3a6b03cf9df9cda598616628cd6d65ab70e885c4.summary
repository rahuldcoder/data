@entity0 -- visitors to the @entity5 website have identified five women depicted in photographs found in a suspected serial killer 's home this summer , but police need to independently confirm those claims , spokeswoman @entity2 said friday			1
authorities would not say whether those women are alive or dead , @entity2 said			1
a website displaying the photos received 10 million hits in 24 hours after police asked for assistance in naming more than 100 women depicted in 180 photos , which police released thursday , @entity2 said			1
some women were featured in more than one picture , police said			2
police have also received more than a dozen phone calls since releasing the photos , they said friday			2
authorities want to know whether a serial killer known as the @entity26 has more than the 10 murder victims that police are now alleging			1
" we are grateful for the public 's response to the release of the images , " a statement said			2
" it is our fervent hope that with this response , coupled with the tireless efforts of our detectives , the women depicted in these images will be positively identified			1
" in july , 57 - year - old @entity26 was arrested and charged with 10 murders and one attempted murder dating to 1985 , and @entity0 police spent hundreds of hours sifting through thousands of photographs , polaroids and videotape found in @entity26 's house			1
the bodies of victims , many working as prostitutes , were all found in close proximity to each other in a neighborhood formerly known as @entity54			0
@entity26 , a mechanic who once worked for the @entity5 , was arrested in july after police say they matched his dna with dna left on some of the victims			1
police were led to @entity58 after his 28 - year - old son got arrested and gave a @entity55 swab , authorities said			0

he declined to talk about the context in which the women 's images appeared			0
" the lifestyle or the situation that these women are in would defeat our plea with the public , " @entity80 said			2
