-- in my life , i 've often heard that " comparison is the thief of joy			1
" i never really thought much about it until taking on @entity0 's @entity8 challenge			1
if i were to compare myself to my @entity8 teammates , i would believe i 'm falling short			1
will @entity10 runs something crazy like a six - minute mile ; i 'm steady at a 15 - to 16 - minute mile			2
@entity13 makes swimming look effortless , while i need an additional swim coach outside of @entity8			1
it would be easy to look at that and think i 'm failing			2
some people think comparison is a good thing			1
" why would n't you want to swim as well as @entity13 or run as fast as @entity22 ? " it 's not that i do n't want to			1
it 's just that i 'm not there yet			1
when we compare ourselves to others , we ca n't be objective			2
when we look at those who seem to have it all , we beat ourselves up			2
but we do n't have all the details of their situation			0
get fit and others will follow during my runs , i 've noticed three sets of people : those i 'm faster than , those i 'm slower than and those who run at a similar pace			0
running allows me to stop all the noise of day - to - day life and focus on me			1
it 's a time to cleanse my mind			1
if i started comparing myself to the other runners , i would n't be able to enjoy " my time			1
" inevitably when we compare ourselves to others , negative thoughts enter our consciousness			0
the negative thoughts might be directed toward ourselves or at the people to whom we are comparing ourselves			1
it 's my experience that negativity only breeds more negativity , and that 's where comparison leads			1
i 've decided my motto for the rest of this triathlon journey , and my life , is going to be " no comparison			1
" when i say " no comparison , " it reminds me to be present in the moment and not be defined by another 's opinion because i 'm the only one who knows me			1
it 's more than a race to me i 'm getting ready to attend my 15 - year high school reunion in a week , and i 'm truly looking forward to it			2
i know some former classmates will be comparing themselves to the rest of the class , and some will even compare themselves to me			2
@entity81 i hear , " i wish i had your dedication " or " your willpower " and so on			0
stop it people ! do n't compare yourselves to me because you only see what i let you see			0
every day is not smooth sailing			0
even though i 've lost more than 185 pounds , i still see glimpses of the old me			0
when i get stressed , i still want to go to food for comfort			0
i admit that i have broken down a couple times recently and had a piece of cake or an order of @entity95 fries			0
at first i beat myself up and felt guilty			0
then i told myself what 's done is done ; get back to obtaining the life you 've been dreaming of			1
this 198 - pound me has more confidence , strength , happiness and love in her life than the 385 - pound me did , and i know the 150 - pound me will have even more of that than the 198 - pound me			2
you may lose friends when you lose weight there is a fine line between inspiration and comparison			1
i have many people i admire , but i do n't want to be them or be like them			0
i 've have a couple of special personal trainers in my life			2
seeing them help people , including myself , become the individuals they 've only ever dreamed of being has made me realize i have something to offer other than my story			0
those people have inspired me to study for my personal trainer certification			0
i 'm not setting out for @entity124 status ; i genuinely want to help others the way my trainers and friends have helped me			0
each of us are unique and have something different to offer the world			0
the only person we have to be better than is the person we were yesterday			0
i challenge you , dear reader , to starting living a life of " no comparison			1
" when you take the pressure off yourself to live up to the image of who you think defines success , you will be surprised at who you can become			0
