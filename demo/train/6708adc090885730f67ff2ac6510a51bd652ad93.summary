@entity0 , @entity1 -- i think i stopped trusting the @entity6 government right after learning that for 40 years , instead of treating a small group of poor , uneducated people officials had identified as having syphilis , officials not only withheld the diagnosis from them , but the cure as well , just to see what would happen if the disease went untreated			1
this was done even if what would happen was eventually death , which is why burial insurance was given to the unsuspecting victims as if the government was doing them a favor			1
and this did n't happen a very long time ago either			2
in fact , the first wave of gen @entity25 were out of diapers while the @entity28 was still going on			2
once you see how hard @entity31 sucker punches people he identifies as expendable , you learn to keep your guard up whenever he comes around			0
it is for this reason that @entity37 is nowhere in my retirement plans			1
call me crazy , but the idea of trusting the government to take care of me , to provide me with " security " when i 'm old and frail is far more frightening than the thought of me trying to make it on my own			1
i 'm not yet 40 , so theoretically i still have plenty of time to have my own plan in place			2
yes , i 've paid into @entity37			1
no , i do n't expect to benefit from it , at least not at the level those who are currently collecting are benefiting			2
and i do n't know anyone in any line of work my age or younger who does			0
we are not as mad about this switcheroo as much as we are mad that the reform can keeps getting kicked down a road that 's getting shorter and shorter by a bunch of politicians who know better but are too afraid of losing voters who wo n't be around when the money 's all gone anyway			1
anybody with a high school diploma and a calculator can see how entitlement programs are damaging the economy and that some sort of reform is necessary to ensure their long - term solvency			0
and yet during budget and debt ceiling talks , @entity74 such as @entity75 and @entity76 responded as if the @entity79 wanted to sell voters ' first - born babies into slavery			0
on monday , president @entity83 introduced another plan without touching @entity37			1
the democrats wo n't even support the modest changes recommended by the president 's own debt commission , including phasing in a two - year increase in the retirement age over the next 65 years and raising the ceiling on payroll taxes			0
they keep mocking us with talk of protecting the middle class when in reality protecting the middle class would have been passing a budget and introducing entitlement reforms before the extras from " @entity102 " got into @entity103			0
but just as @entity79 presidential candidates are saying whatever they can to appease their base ( except for @entity107 , which is why he is in last place ) , the @entity74 are just as guilty of pandering to the home crowd , even if the desires of that crowd are n't nearly as much to blame for the economic trouble the country finds itself in as the @entity116 tax cuts and relaxed @entity118 regulations			1
it 's all a game , and election after election , we keep getting played			0
remember @entity83 did n't say he and the members of @entity103 might not get paid if the debt ceiling was n't raised , but that @entity37 and military checks may not go out			1
and he 's the one being accused of being a socialist			0
can you imagine what the rhetoric of a good ol ' fashion free - market capitalist would sound like ? here 's a hint : rewatch the video from the @entity2 / @entity136 @entity135 last week in which @entity132 asked if society should let an injured 30 - year - old man without health insurance die			0
much was made about the cheers that could be heard coming from some of the crowd , but i was far more disturbed by the lack of chastising that came from the stage immediately after the cheers			0
you mean to tell me the possible next leader of the free world does n't have an instant rebuke to people who cheer at the mention of uninsured @entity6 dying ? and i 'm supposed to trust that person to have my best interest at heart when i 'm at my most vulnerable ? the @entity156 gave birth to @entity37			1
@entity158 fed it and made it strong			0
today the sheer number of the baby boomers is slowly strangling it to death			0
and because politicians continue to use @entity37 as one of its many chess pieces to manipulate people to vote a certain way , one day we 'll speak of it much in the same way we speak of dial - up internet access			1
only instead of laughing at how long it used to take to log on , we 'll be shaking our heads , reminiscing back to the time when government actually cared			2
as i hinted earlier , my faith in government went out the door the moment i found out it was controlled by people			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : i 'm not counting on collecting @entity37
he says relying on government to protect you is a *mistake*
his generation is upset that politicians keep kicking can down the road , he says
@entity185 : presidential candidates except for @entity107 are ducking the issue
