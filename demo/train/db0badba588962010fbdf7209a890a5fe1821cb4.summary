-- it 's time for some tiger cubs to approvingly roar for our strict parents , their domineering ways and their inflexibly high standards			1
the current depiction of tiger parenting is decidedly negative			1
@entity11 's book on " @entity12 " and @entity14 's report " does @entity9 ? parenting profiles of @entity20 and @entity21 " suggest that strict @entity16 - style parenting produces an army of disengaged or emotionally stunted robots			1
while i ca n't speak for everyone , my own experience suggests that such upbringing also gives us the smarts to recognize our emotional and social deficiencies and to address them			1
my parents are immigrants from @entity30			1
i was an only child , and i was expected to excel academically and extracurricularly			1
i got straight a 's			1
i played violin for hours			2
i did extra math , chemistry and physics problem sets under the eagle - eyed gaze of my mother			2
through it all , i cried and screamed			2
i told her i hated my life , my teachers , my school and all my activities			1
she yelled that i just had to get through it			2
@entity48 was not an option			0
and of course she was right			0
opinion : @entity12 moms , do n't turn your kids into robots i owe everything i am and have accomplished to my parents			1
my family expected a lot from me only because they believed in me and wanted the best for me			0
they pushed me to excel because they valued me as an individual			0
@entity66 parents express their love through expectation of greatness , not in acceptance of mediocrity			1
some people interpret such expectation as parental rejection of their worth as individuals			0
i always interpreted such crushing expectation as the ultimate belief in my self - worth			0
i knew that i was not being set up to fail			0
my mother did not push me to excel because she prized my accomplishments more than my feelings			0
she listened to my feelings , but she also knew that my teenage feelings were volatile and irrational			0
she knew better than to let my future be derailed by such feelings			0
my mother also knows that life has many obstacles , some external , many internal			1
she loved me too much to let me give up easily when confronted with those obstacles			0
for that i am eternally grateful			0
i gained confidence and resilience from tackling my endless workload and from fighting through sleep deprivation			1
i knew that i was capable of getting through seemingly impossible situations			0
i knew that if i failed , then i just had to try harder			0
failure is not a permanent state , but merely a temporary challenge that had to be tackled creatively			0
the knock against tiger parenting style is that it does not foster emotional and social development			1
well , it partly comes down to expressing love and affection differently			0
@entity66 parents may not often say " i love you , " but actions speak louder than words			1
my family never would have spent the time , money and effortâ € ” not to mention the emotional energyâ € ” on me if they did not love me			1
they never said this , of course			0
sure , my mother viewed socializing with others as a waste of time			2
she wanted me to be valedictorian , not homecoming queen			0
i did n't attend my homecoming			0
i was probably studying or working on my science project			2
now , i readily acknowledge that there is great value in socializing with others , and that my current social skills probably would be better if i had more time to hang out at the mall or at @entity125			1
but childhood hours are limited			0
each child only has about 157,680 hours before he / she turns 18			2
the opportunity cost of being an accomplished child is that it takes away time from making friends and nurturing relationships			1
for me , the tradeoff was worth it			0
there are skills that can only be learned in childhood			2
it is hard for a student to catch up academically if she is significantly behind in high school			2
but someone can become more self - aware , work on social skills and learn negotiating tactics later in life			1
without the skills and expertise that is a result of excelling , i would never have the chance to sit at the important tables to participate in the discussions , no matter how great my social skills			1
i value my tiger cub upbringing mostly for the tools it gives me to make a difference in my community			2
i know plenty of grown up tiger cubs who tutor at - risk youth , advocate for the disadvantaged , and generally strive to improve the world			1
our childhood accomplishments enable us to meaningfully contribute to our communities			0
and is n't that where self - awareness and proper socialization lead us all ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

@entity171 : some suggest that tiger parenting style produces emotionally stunted kids
