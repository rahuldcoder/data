situated at the heart of @entity2 , @entity0 is one of the most densely populated countries on the planet			1
more than 5 million people are crammed into this bustling city - state with an area of just 276 square miles			1
the squeeze is so tight there 's little room left to take advantage of the surrounding natural beauty			2
but one developer wants to tap into the tourism market by singling out the nearby @entity16 to host " @entity17 , " the world 's largest eco-resort			1
the $ 240 million development , currently in construction , will stretch out over a cluster of six islands covering almost 3.3 million square meters ( 35 million square feet )			1
while the archipelago lies just 16 kilometers ( 9 miles ) off the coast of @entity0 , the area is actually part of and administered by neighboring @entity28			1
crystal clear water , coral reefs and thousands of mangrove trees provide the stunning backdrop to marinas , villas , luxury bungalows and hotel accommodation			0
it 's already an impressive site but the " property is just a start , " said @entity17 pte director , @entity38			1
eco-tourism roughly 70 % of the islands will be preserved in their natural state -- part of the developer 's commitment to creating a viable eco-park			2
" without that 70 % of the natural attractions , our island development will be just like any other or another real estate development , " @entity38 continued			2
nature trails and aquaculture tours will allow visitors to enjoy @entity57 's natural beauty while the short boat ride to @entity0 keeps popular attractions like @entity60 and @entity61 close			1
but being green also means development plans have had to be stringently checked and monitored			0
caps have been set on future visitors , buildings have been relocated from where they were originally slated for and the overall number of units has been paired back			0
according to @entity72 , director of @entity73 , such amendments were necessary to maintain authenticity			0
" it has to feel like we are blend with the nature , " @entity72 said			0
" we do n't want to change that , we want to blend into this environment and make everything balanced , everything synchronized			0
" foreign ownership the average cost per square meter of property comes in at about $ 5,000			0
if that sounds like a deal for an over-the - water villa a short stroll from a powdery white beach , there 's a reason			2
in line with @entity28 property law , foreign investors ca n't buy their piece of paradise here , only lease it for set terms			1
" we are actually selling the lease of the building , " @entity38 explained			0
" every 25 years we do an extension for 20 years , every 20 years we do another renewal			0
" the developers say many investors are undeterred			0
more than 500 homes have sold to date , mostly to buyers from @entity0 , @entity109 and @entity110 in total over 1,200 holiday villas and apartments will be needed to house the one million tourists expected each year			2
with @entity17 set to welcome its first guests in late 2015 , there 's not long left to ensure everything is in place to meet that target .			1
