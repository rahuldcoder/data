-- we have a tendency , when things in the news get bad , to tell ourselves that it 's never been quite this dismal before			1
we are tempted , when disputes become particularly acrimonious , to believe that the current bitterness is unprecedented			0
so it 's beneficial , once in a while , to look at our current problems in light of what has gone before			1
and to remember just how much the @entity14 has endured			0
the newspaper @entity15 reported last week that there has been a sharp increase in the unemployment rate for male veterans of the @entity21 and @entity22 wars			1
the paper said that such unemployment has tripled since the recession began , having reached 15 percent last month			1
more than 250,000 of the male veterans were said to be unemployed last month , with another 400,000 having left the workforce for various reasons : to raise children , or attend college , or because they have just stopped trying to find work			1
@entity32 , a spokesman for the @entity33 , said : " it makes you almost want to go out and rip off all the ' @entity37 ' bumper stickers			0
if you want to support your troops , give them a job			0
" ca n't argue with that			2
after what @entity14 soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity45 are asked to sacrifice , there is something melancholy about the thought of them coming home and having trouble finding a way to support their families			0
the nation is likely to work on a solution to this honorably and in good faith			0
there was a time , during parallel circumstances , when that was n't the case			2
it was one of the darkest moments in @entity14 history , and few people speak about it anymore			2
the shorthand for it was " the @entity68			0
" in the spring and summer of 1932 , with the @entity71 gripping the country , tens of thousands of @entity70 veterans and their families gathered in @entity73 to demand what they felt they had been promised			1
they set up shantytowns , and vowed to stay put until their entreaties were met			0
the federal government had , in 1924 , issued service certificates -- redeemable for bonuses -- to the soldiers who had returned from @entity70 the certificates were intended to reward the veterans for the time they had spent fighting for their country			2
they were like long - term bonds -- they could not be redeemed until 1945			0
but something happened between 1924 and 1932 : the economy collapsed			2
poverty and joblessness were everywhere			0
the veterans , many of them hungry and destitute , came to @entity73 asking @entity98 to allow them to collect their bonuses early			1
the @entity101 voted down the bill			0
so there were the military veterans , amassed in the nation 's capital			1
out of money , out of luck , almost out of hope , they refused to leave			0
the government ordered their evacuation			0
many of the veterans resisted ; the police shot and killed two of them			2
with that , the president of the @entity14 , @entity116 , fearing that radicals had infiltrated the veterans , ordered the @entity120 to take over the involuntary evacuation			1
and this country was confronted with the news that the @entity120 was moving against the old soldiers			1
at the highest level of the @entity120 assigned to the task were men who would later become extraordinarily famous			1
gen. @entity128 was in command ; maj. @entity130 was the go - between with the local police force ; maj. @entity132 was in charge of the cavalry			0
bayonets were drawn ; tanks and soldiers on horseback advanced into the crowds ; acrid gas was unleashed on the protesting veterans ; the makeshift camps were torn down			1
even though president @entity116 did n't want it to happen , @entity128 sent his troops across a bridge to the site of the veterans ' main living quarters			1
a fire broke out ; it was never determined with certainty who set it , but there it was : the @entity14 veterans ' cobbled - together homes in flames , as the @entity120 drove them out			1
there was no television back then ; it is almost impossible to fathom what would have happened if the country had been able to see , live , the military moving relentlessly against former members of the military who were asking for the means to survive			2
as rugged as the economy is now -- and as difficult a time as some veterans are having as they look for work in a dismal hiring environment -- no one foresees a day when soldiers will again be ordered to roust former soldiers and their families			2
later in their lives , @entity128 , @entity130 and @entity132 all lamented , with varying degrees of emotion , having had to play a role in driving the @entity68 out of @entity73			1
their commander in chief had decreed that it must be done , so they carried out his orders			0
we 've come a long way since then ; no president with an eye toward his legacy would order the @entity120 to do such a thing , and it 's hard to believe that military officials would not , behind closed doors , try everything in their power to avoid having to use @entity14 troops that way			1
but as much as things have changed , certain truths have n't			2
we ask our soldiers , in times of war , to cross the oceans and fight in our name			2
when they come home -- those who do come home alive -- we tell them , in bad economic times , that the jobs for them are just not there			0
if our soldiers want to work , we owe it to them to make it easier for that to happen			0
there may never again , we should hope , be a @entity68 camped in the streets of @entity73 , pleading for help			1
the best way to prevent such a sight is to provide the help before the despair of the unemployed veterans reaches that breaking point			0
you might call it our patriotic duty			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

people have a tendency to think we live in the worst of times , says @entity225
he says we have a serious problem with unemployment among veterans
still , today 's troubles do n't equal the woes of the early 1930s , @entity225 says
he says jobless veterans protesting in 1932 were chased out of @entity73 by @entity120
