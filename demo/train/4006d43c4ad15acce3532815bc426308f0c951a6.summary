-- the generation of gays and lesbians that literally created the modern @entity5 movement -- from the heroes of the 1969 @entity8 riots to their slightly younger friends -- is at , or nearing , retirement age			1
that used to mean the beginning of an extremely difficult time in an @entity5 person 's life			1
but as gay baby boomers find more acceptance in mainstream society and continue to do what they 've always done -- push to make a better world for the @entity5 community -- their retirement options are slowly improving			1
that is , if they decide to retire at all			2
" the notion of retirement has never been a part of my vocabulary , " said @entity26 , ceo and co-founder of @entity28			2
nearly 61 , @entity26 has put some thought into what he should do with his strategic public relations and marketing firm as he gets older			2
like many friends his age who are also entrepreneurs , he plans to keep working			2
" because i run a business , as i get older i can change the intensity of my engagement in the kinds of work i take on , " @entity26 said			0
" i know i 'm lucky that way , and i 'm lucky in my personal life as well			0
my husband is 50 , so i have a younger man to help me if i need it , " he said , laughing			0
for decades , according to published studies and reports , many @entity5 seniors entered into a kind of dangerous isolation , because the majority did not have children or spouses to help care for them			1
even if they did have the benefit of a partner to help as their health declined , they faced extra burdens their straight counterparts did not have			1
without federal marriage equality , gay couples -- no matter how long they 've been together -- can not inherit each other 's @entity68 benefits , even if they were legally married in the handful of states that allow it			1
they can be designated as the beneficiaries of each other 's retirement savings , but must pay inheritance taxes that straight widows and widowers do not			1
in order to make health care decisions on behalf of an incapacitated partner , gay couples must pay additional legal fees to be granted medical power of attorney			1
historically , nothing could stop a hospital or nursing home from forbidding a gay person from visiting their partner , and openly gay people often faced discrimination from health care providers , according to the @entity96 report , " @entity97 2010			2
" consequently , many @entity5 seniors ended up going back into the closet as their declining health and mobility left them dependent on strangers for help , according to a study conducted by the @entity105 , @entity106 and others			1
or they were slow to ask for help -- even if they badly needed it			0
" when you put that together -- the absence of adult children and a partner to help , and add barriers to accessing services , and limit the financial means others have -- then this very thin network of support breaks at exactly the wrong time , right when there is an increasing need for services , " said @entity111 , executive director of the group @entity112 for @entity113 , known as @entity114			2
read more : growing old openly gay roll of the dice @entity26 said his retirement plans and those of his friends are nothing like those of their fathers ' generation			1
" my father was of the generation that thought you put in your time and then you just take off the rest , and many could afford to do it , " @entity26 said			0
" he had absolutely no plans and had a generous pension			0
" his father worked on @entity148 for a couple of decades , @entity26 said , and was able to retire at 60			0
he lived another 27 years			0
" over time he did get a little discouraged because he felt like he did n't have a purpose , but that 's what the people he knew did , " @entity26 said			0
" they just abruptly stopped working			0
i can tell you , that wo n't be me			0
" he has , however , seen some friends whose plans to continue working have been derailed by health problems			0
" i do know , as we age , our health can fail , and i 've seen it with some friends who are n't as sharp as they once were			0
so i know it 's a roll of the dice on how long we can keep working , " he said			0
" hopefully i can stay healthy and wo n't need the help			0
" but often retirement - age people do need help , and that has not always been easy for the @entity5 community			1
" there is no question we are making a lot of progress in this area , and we 've absolutely been helped along by the emergence of boomers into retirement years , but by the very nature of the enormity of this work , true change will take years , " @entity111 said			1
his organization , @entity114 , has been working to change the situation for older @entity5 people since 1978			1
much has changed for the community since then , he said			1
" especially since the @entity191 administration took office , " @entity111 said			0
" the federal approach to aging issues has improved			2
" while there still is n't federal recognition of marriage for gay couples , the federal @entity195 allowed a rollover option to nonspousal beneficiaries			1
that meant people could leave their pensions to anyone without a tax penalty			0
in the past , only married spouses were eligible for that benefit			0
in 2010 , @entity191 issued a memorandum requiring all hospitals receiving @entity212 or @entity213 funds -- nearly every hospital in the @entity215 -- to respect the right of all patients to choose who may visit them during a hospital stay , including a same - sex domestic partner			1
the president also directed the @entity222 to help ensure that medical decision - making rights of @entity5 patients are respected			1
this year the @entity225 -- the federal agency responsible for funding programs that help the elderly -- finally issued guidance saying agencies and programs it funds should recognize the @entity5 population among those with " the greatest social need			1
" that designation means that there should be more financial backing and programs to help elderly gay people			1
the @entity225 spends more than $ 2.3 billion annually on nutrition and social services for the aging , according to @entity111 , but the lgbt community only sees $ 2 million of that			2
finally , sen. @entity244 , @entity245 , introduced the @entity246 this year			0
if enacted , it would further boost support for the community			2
as it is written now , the @entity250 , which goes up for reauthorization every five years , does not specifically mention @entity5 older adults			1
among the @entity246 's proposals is an amendment that would permanently establish the @entity255 on lgbt aging , which would provide training to providers of services to the elderly around the country			0
it would also require long - term care ombudsmen to collect data relating to discrimination against @entity5 older adults			1
creating gay - friendly facilities on the local level , however , everything may not be as rosy			1
" while the laws have become more accepting of marriage equality of the lgbt community and nondiscrimination policies in a broader sense are more inclusive , that does n't mean people who work with the elderly automatically become more accepting , " said @entity269 , director of aging and economic security with the @entity96			1
" there is often high turnover in nursing home staff and a lack of professionalism , " she said			0
" sometimes even the leadership will get it ( being inclusive of @entity5 people ) , but it does n't get passed on to the people working with the @entity5 community			1
" several organizations , such as the @entity96 and @entity114 , have made training the staffs of senior centers , nursing homes and assisted living facilities a priority			0
they want those workers to become more sensitive in their work with gay people , particularly because members of the baby boomer generation are more likely to be open about their sexuality than previous generations			1
" @entity5 people want to experience the services and programs that exist for all older people , " @entity111 said			1
" so our work has shifted to try and bring along aging and health service organizations so they 're as accessible as possible to the lgbt community			2
" @entity114 , the @entity96 and other groups also train ombudsmen to intervene if an @entity5 person comes forward with a complaint			1
they encourage facilities to create more gay - friendly paperwork , so instead of requesting the name of a husband or wife , the forms include space for a spouse or partner			2
even changing the decorations can help			0
" these changes do n't have to cost a lot , " @entity325 said			0
" we 've talked about something as simple as having photos in the lobby of the senior center or nursing home that are more reflective of a broader population -- anything to signal that the space is more welcoming			0
" even in the short time that @entity114 has been conducting its training , it has seen a difference , @entity111 said			0
" in the past few years we started to notice a real change in the reception of our calls , " he said			0
" we used to reach out to these organizations and hear , ' oh , we do n't have any gay people using our services , ' and occasionally we 'd have even hostile responses			2
now our offers to help have been increasingly met with a desire on the part of these service providers to do a better job working with @entity5 folks			2
" @entity26 said he hopes he will never need those support services , but if he does , he 's confident his generation will continue to make them more accessible to the lgbt community			2
" we , meaning baby boomers , are such a huge and active bunch , " @entity26 said			1
" i 've seen it so many times before : where we go , institutions change			0
i know with different generations in the past , there were serious isolation issues and institutions that refused to see us as full human beings			0
" but when i think of the arc of change for true equality for @entity5 people and how much has gotten better since my generation was in high school and college , it 's way beyond what i ever imagined was possible , " he added			1
" and i imagine it will get that much better for all of us , so @entity5 people wo n't have to live in fear when they do need the help			2
" how has @entity5 life changed over the years ? share your story with @entity384			1
you 're story could be featured in an upcoming @entity0 story .			0
