@entity2 @entity1 's 1.3 billion citizens may soon find it much harder to belt out their national anthem at will			0
a series of rules proposed by the government will set strict limits on when , where and how " @entity11 " -- the anthem of the @entity12 since 1949 -- can be performed , state - run @entity6 news agency reported friday			1
the anthem is not allowed to be played or sung at private weddings and funerals , dancing parties , commercial events , or any other setting with " an inappropriate atmosphere			1
" when singing the anthem , people should dress appropriately , stand still and be full of energy , according to the government			1
follow the rhythm the rules then get technical : people must sing the powerful marching song in its entirety , enunciate every word and follow the rhythm			1
no one is permitted to start or stop singing midway -- and altering the melody , lyrics or musical arrangement is forbidden			0
no whispering , applauding or talking on the phone , either , while the anthem is played			2
there is no official word , yet , on how violators would be punished			1
while some of those rules sound reasonable , others may be overly harsh , especially to @entity44 who are used to hearing adaptations of " @entity46 " as varied as @entity48 's instrumental rock version at the @entity50 music festival , to @entity52 's soulful rendition before the @entity53			0
creative alternatives despite the government effort , @entity1 people still seem to appreciate creative interpretations of their normally standardized national anthem			2
at an airport ceremony welcoming the visiting @entity1 president @entity63 this past summer , a @entity60 military band -- led by trumpeters going either artistic or astray -- played a refreshingly different " @entity11 " with a new tune , an extra section and a bit of jazz flair			1
while the leaders appeared unfazed on the tarmac , video of the @entity60 performance quickly went viral across @entity1 cyberspace			0
upon learning the new anthem decree , most @entity1 internet users seem to be taking it in stride			0
one widely re-posted comment deadpans : " at least banning the national anthem at funerals makes sense , as the first verse ' arise ! all those who refuse to be slaves ! ' would be so inappropriate			2
singing that line to an open casket would just be creepy ! "			0
