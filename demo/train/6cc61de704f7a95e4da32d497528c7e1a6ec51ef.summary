-- the news that @entity2 plans to dump @entity3 -- again -- lifts the curtain on a dark corner of the media business			1
is it the fact that a network could be thickheaded enough to call the same play that blew up last time with the @entity12 debacle ? nah			0
it 's the way that television critics despise @entity3 , and how that colors the coverage of the late - night wars			1
when the @entity22 ' @entity21 broke the story last week that @entity2 is ready to hand " @entity25 " to @entity24 in 2014 , there was this line buried deep in the piece : " another complicating factor has been mr. @entity3 's success in the ratings			1
" let 's ponder that for a moment			0
@entity3 has the top - rated show at 11:30			2
@entity2 executives are nonetheless planning on booting him when his contract expires in the fall of 2014 and moving the show from @entity39 , @entity40 , to @entity41			2
watch : @entity43 editor created fake @entity45 identity imagine how that story line would play out if critics and reporters viewed @entity3 as sympathetically as they do , say , @entity49 or @entity3 's @entity51 rival , @entity52			1
what ? ? @entity2 is kicking @entity3 to the curb ? the guy who has made the network hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two decades ? the man who bounced back from his last firing and regained the late - night throne ? what did he do to deserve this ? instead the media reaction is a collective shrug of the shoulders : yeah , makes sense			1
time to wheel the old guy off the stage			0
@entity3 has n't been funny since the @entity69 administration and @entity49 appeals to a younger crowd			1
watch : do the critics want @entity3 booted off the stage ? @entity74 's @entity73 writes that " @entity3 ' it 's just a business ' @entity3 deserves no man 's pity however this plays out			1
" the @entity80 complains about his " groan - worthy jokes			0
" but here 's the thing : @entity3 does n't appeal to anyone but the viewers			1
at least those who live west of the @entity87 and east of the @entity88			0
he does broad comedy and hardly wields the kind of cutting - edge style favored by the bicoastal elites			0
but much of @entity93 likes him			2
does the 62 - year - old comic skew old ? well , he 's been beating @entity52 and @entity95 even in the coveted 18 - to - 49 demo			0
watch : is the press now forgetting the horror of @entity99 ? the critics made the same mistake last time around			0
@entity102 was so much funnier than @entity3 that giving him " tonight " rather than risking his departure was a brilliant move by @entity2			1
except that @entity12 's quirky humor appealed to a narrow slice of the audience , the ratings plummeted , and a $ 32 million payout later , he was gone and @entity3 was back			2
@entity3 has been punching back in his monologue , likening @entity2 suits to " snakes " and saying that the network 's motto is " @entity114			1
" the @entity22 reports that a top executive ordered @entity3 to stop mocking the network , a ham - handed attempt at censorship that has obviously failed			0
one strange twist is that some conservative pundits are carping that @entity2 is ousting @entity3 because of his jokes about president @entity122 ( he ribs every president ) and because , unlike the more openly liberal @entity95 , he appeals to the heartland			1
it 's obviously more of a dollars - and - cents gamble that @entity49 is the future			2
and indeed , @entity24 makes sense as @entity3 's eventual heir			1
watch : is there a double standard in gay marriage coverage ? but in their haste , @entity2 execs risk blowing up the situation the way they did in hustling @entity137 off the " today " show , sparking a backlash against @entity140 and sending what had been the iconic morning show plunging into second place			0
their prime - time lineup is in fifth place			0
do they really need to immolate one of the few time periods where the network is no. 1 ? @entity49 's a young guy			2
@entity151 was 66 when he stepped down			0
what 's the rush ? the critics , of course , wo n't be happy until @entity3 is working the comedy clubs where he spends his vacations ( and possibly competing against @entity2 from @entity158 )			1
and they are entitled to their views of who has comedic chops and who is out of gas			0
but in this case , they 're out of touch with the people who vote with their remote controls .			0

@entity170 : @entity2 's plan to *replace* @entity3 sits well with critics
he says @entity3 's brand of comedy appeals to much of @entity93
critics are free to prefer @entity49 , @entity178 , but *replacing* @entity3 is risky , he says
