-- an official national day of mourning in @entity2 on thursday , called by president @entity3 to memorialize the lives of dozens of miners mowed down in a police fusillade one week ago , turned into an opportunity by his critics to call for his ouster			1
while government leaders urged restraint , and religious figures prayed for redemption , the embattled president 's opponents exploited an opening created by the tragedy to portray his government -- and trade unions allied with @entity3 -- as pawns of foreign , white owners			1
these attacks , lodged in several cases by former allies , threatened to reset the terms of labor organizing , radicalize the tone of political debate , and heighten the chances that the president will be ousted by his own political party at the @entity32 ' ( @entity32 ) national conference next december			1
what began as a localized labor dispute , in other words , morphed in the wake of memorial services for the dead , into a volatile , ongoing national crisis			0
the catastrophe at @entity41 placed a harsh spotlight both upon what has changed in @entity2 life since the @entity32 was voted into power 18 years ago -- in the unprecedented response of the head of state to the crisis -- and also what has remained painfully unchanged			1
generations of relatively low - paid black men are still forced to migrate long distances from home in order to take up the most difficult and dangerous kinds of jobs			2
miners are still drawn into mining towns where a kind of frontier spirit prevails			0
injuries are common and unforgiving , and the salaries earned by a single worker often support up to 20 family members who are unemployed , according to the federation of trade unions			2
increasingly , the working poor have begun turning against traditional unions , like the @entity68 , which is allied with the national federation , @entity69 , in turn part of the @entity32 coalition			1
little wonder , under these circumstances , that @entity3 's studied and measured approach to the crisis has inspired so little confidence among the strikers themselves			1
the strength of anti-anc agitation in @entity41 will keep labor and party leaders up at night because they know their history : back in the 1980s , massive strikes by miners helped fuel a mass insurrection that led to the end of apartheid			1
after the mine shootings , the cause of widespread shock and dismay was readily apparent , and the raw feelings were steadily reinforced around the clock by video taken from the scene			1
the stunning images of the shootings , captured from different angles by various outlets , kept public outrage alive			2
the video showed the final minutes of a standoff between police and strikers , which ended in the fusillade that ended the lives of 34 protestors and seriously wounded 78 others			2
what 's behind the marikana massacre ? they were protesters at @entity114 's marikana platinum mine , located 60 miles ( about 100 km ) northwest of @entity115 , and the shooting constituted the worst mass killing by police since apartheid ended			1
in the days after the tragedy , police spokesmen insisted that officers were forced by a charging mass of strikers to fire in order to defend themselves			0
it was difficult to view the footage without wondering why police had launched teargas at strikers on the hilltop where they had assembled , forcing them to scatter in a funnel in the direction of officers gathered below the hill when their weapons were loaded with live ammunition and set for automatic fire			0
the impact of the footage , played in regular loops on local television broadcasts , made it difficult for @entity3 to assert his authority			1
he quickly returned from a trip in neighboring @entity145 to visit @entity41 twice in a matter of days , dispatched nine of his ministers to assist survivors and their families with burials among other actions and swiftly appointed a @entity153 to thoroughly examine the causes and lessons of the tragedy			0
" we are in control of the situation , " he said			0
even as the president made pains to express a sense of grief and dismay , and call for calm , however , his opponents sharpened their attacks on him as a leader out of touch with workers and the poor , the key constituency in his rise to power five years ago			2
at worship services near the site of the police shootings on thursday , the ceremony began with a plea from archbishop @entity179 for no one to use the tragedy for narrow political interests			1
by the end of the service , cabinet ministers had been forced to flee the venue , while speakers called on the president to resign			0
@entity189 , former leader of the @entity32 's youth wing and a former @entity3 ally , took the podium to pin responsibility for the catastrophe on the president			1
" this massacre was committed under his supervision , " @entity189 insisted			0
he slammed the @entity32 , from which he was expelled earlier in the year , and pressed the case for nationalization of @entity2 's mines			2
the stakes in the unfolding national debate about who was responsible for the tragedy , and who should pay the price , could not be higher , not just for the president 's political survival but for @entity2 's economic health and stability as well			0
platinum is the new gold in a country where mining provides 20 percent of gdp			0
though @entity2 has the world 's largest reserves of this precious and rare metal , which is used in everything from catalytic converters and electrodes to jewelry , it is found in deep shafts that are difficult , dangerous and costly to operate			0
against this backdrop , government officials sought to reassure workers that they would maintain their party 's historic " bias towards the poor , " while not scaring off international investors wary of an industry prone to wildcat strikes			2
the strikers at @entity41 mine were rock drill operators who had broken away from the @entity68 in favor of a more militant independent union , and wildcats strikes across the industry are increasingly common			2
a spokesman for the @entity242 was at pains to point out that 95 % of mines in the country were operating normally yesterday			0
in the recent past , national leaders paid a price for crossing labor			0
in 2008 , the @entity32 instructed president @entity250 to resign his office , largely as a result of organizing on behalf of @entity3 , who was backed by the labor federation as a " son of the soil " who promised to close the gap between the government and its people			1
if party leaders conclude , in the wake of the marikana mass killing , that only a change at the top can convince @entity32 's core constituencies that the party of liberation -- now the party of government -- still represents the interests of workers and the poor , @entity3 will be shown the door			1
that is the way the wheel turns in a country where the advent of political liberation has not yet produced greater equality or material freedom			0

police shootings at mine test @entity3 , governing @entity32 political party
18 years after apartheid , not much has changed economically for migrants
increasingly , working poor are turning against traditional @entity32 - allied unions
