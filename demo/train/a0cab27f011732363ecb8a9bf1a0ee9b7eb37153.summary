@entity0 , @entity1 -- there 's a bit of a trend brewing this summer concert season -- put together a couple of big - name acts for a nationwide tour , then record a song together to promote the event			1
members of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 in 2003			1
@entity13 and @entity14 have teamed up for a song and tour			1
it started with classic rockers @entity14 and @entity13 , with their " @entity14 ' " tour and single of the same name			1
now @entity22 and @entity23 are getting on the bandwagon			1
the two horn - heavy bands have recorded three songs especially for their joint 30 - city summer tour			1
it 's part of a charity campaign to benefit food banks across the country -- " three songs for @entity34 or three dollars			2
" @entity22 and @entity23 team up on the new song " you			1
" the bands also take a stab at each other 's material , with @entity22 recording @entity23 's " @entity43 " and @entity23 covering @entity22 's " @entity44			1
" " the fact that the artists and bands , in this case , are touring together builds excitement with the possibility of the live performance that is exclusive to the tour , " said @entity45 of the @entity47 's @entity46			2
it 's " sort of a ' once in a lifetime ' type of attraction that helps to sell concert tickets , merchandise and , hopefully , cds and downloads			0
" concertgoers who contribute three cans of food or donate at least $ 3 will get a download card to access the tunes			0
people who do n't make the shows will be able to donate online and download the songs at @entity72			0
the web site is expected to launch in early june			0
" this is a dream come true , " said @entity23 's @entity74 , who came up with the three - songs promotion			1
" we want to invite everyone to help us do our small part to help feed @entity81 , " added @entity22 's trumpeter @entity77			1
artists jamming together on stage is nothing new , and occasionally the songs are released as singles -- @entity87 and @entity88 's " @entity89 , " from the 1988 album and film " @entity93 , " for example			2
of course , duets promoting two hot artists or bands are hardly new either			0
remember @entity97 and @entity98 on " @entity99 " or " @entity100 " by @entity101 of @entity102 and @entity103 of @entity104 from the " footloose " soundtrack ? " hip - hop artists have been using duets for some time to reach audiences of both artists , " @entity45 said			0
in some cases , more than two artists collaborate			0
" even before that , country artists used this means to reach a larger audience for both artists , " he said , noting the collaborations between @entity115 and @entity116 , and @entity117 and @entity118			0
the new songs for the 2009 tours flip conventional wisdom			0
for decades , groups have recorded albums , then gone on tour to promote them			2
specifically recording songs to promote a tour featuring a pairing of acts is a new idea -- and possibly one whose time has come , given the re-emergence of singles in the digital download age			2
of course , it all depends on the success of the song			0
in the case of @entity14 and @entity13 , they 've scored a hit with their new tune			1
it 's been riding near the top of the classic rock charts -- the biggest original hit by either band in years			0
" the jam ... is just plain , old - school , rock ' n ' roll fun , " @entity14 's @entity153 said on the band 's web site			2
should other bands follow suit and score hits , it might prompt other classic pop artists to join forces not only on tour , but in the studio as well .			0

@entity14 and @entity13 have combined for hit and tour
@entity22 and @entity23 recorded three songs for joint tour
combining forces not new , but way it 's being used may be
