-- study after study has linked long work hours , demanding bosses , and other on - the - job stressors to health problems ranging from insomnia to heart attacks			1
but the jobs themselves may not be entirely to blame			0
according to a new study of @entity15 twins , the relationship between job stress and health problems is influenced in part by differences in personality and temperament , such as how optimistic , confident or self - critical a person is			1
and these traits are in turn closely related to genetic makeup			0
the researchers analyzed data from about 300 pairs of fraternal and ( genetically ) identical twins , many of whom did not grow up together			1
the various combinations of shared genes and upbringings allowed the researchers to parse the connections between genes and environment , job satisfaction and stress , and physical health			1
@entity0 : job killing you ? 8 types of work - related stress after crunching the numbers , they made two initial conclusions : personality type is associated with job stress and health , and a large portion of the differences in personality type -- nearly 45 % -- can be attributed to genes			1
taking the analysis one step further , the researchers estimate that genetic effects are responsible for 32 % of the person - to - person variance in job stress , 35 % of the variance in job satisfaction and 47 % of the variance in health problems			1
the upshot ? the path between job stress and poor health runs at least partly through our genes and personality			1
" we 're not saying job stress makes no difference , or there are n't things that cause stress , " says lead author @entity70 , a professor of management at the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74			1
" but we ca n't have a concept ... that life would be better if we just changed jobs			0
" @entity0 : 10 careers with high rates of depression the findings , which were published in the journal @entity88 , seem to suggest a new twist on the old nature - versus - nurture question : what 's more important for stress , the day - to - day work environment ( the " nurture " side , in this case ) or the inborn personality of the employee ? the question may not be so clear - cut , says @entity99 , a professor of psychology at the @entity101 in @entity102			2
in twin studies , @entity104 says , it can be difficult to separate the shared environment -- whether that 's a childhood home or the workplace -- from non-shared environmental factors , such as " random events , " luck , and personal choices			0
" non-shared environment is by far the largest component for most behavioral outcomes , " @entity104 says			0
judge and his colleagues did try to distinguish between shared and non-shared factors			0
in addition to noting whether the twins grew up together , they also controlled for education and job characteristics ( such as a hazardous workplace )			2
still , they acknowledge that " idiosyncratic " differences in non-shared environment are hard to pin down			0
@entity0 : how your job can hurt your heart although much gray area remains , the new study raises the possibility that previous research on the link between job stress and health woes may be providing an incomplete picture			1
epidemiological studies , which look for broad trends in large populations of people , often do n't account for genes or temperament -- factors that can affect a person 's experience of job stress , as well as how they describe it in questionnaires , @entity70 says			1
" what if the very people who report they 're really stressed are the very people who also report -- or actually have -- health problems ? " judge says			2
" we showed that a big part of the relationship between the two is genetic			0
" @entity0 : stressed ? 7 steps to instant calm @entity161 , an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the @entity164 in @entity165 , says it 's important to remember that genes , though influential , do n't control us			1
someone who 's genetically more vulnerable to workplace stress wo n't necessarily get stressed out			2
in fact , @entity161 says , stress often arises when our temperament and our environment clash			0
" we look at the interaction between predisposition and some sort of stressor to really activate someone 's vulnerability , " he says			0
if you are predisposed to stress -- due to your genes , life experiences , or some combination of the two -- the good news is there are steps you can take to fight back			2
talk therapy , for instance , can help people recognize the situations that cause them stress and learn coping strategies , @entity161 says			0
the vicious physiology of stress @entity198 2011			0

the study looked at 300 pairs of @entity15 twins
genes can influence the relationship between job stress and health problems
it 's important to remember genes do n't actually control us
