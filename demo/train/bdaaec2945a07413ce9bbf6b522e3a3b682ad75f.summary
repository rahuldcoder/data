editor 's note : @entity2 , one of @entity4 's " 25 @entity3 " in 2009 , was the first athlete to compete in the @entity5 on an entirely plant - based diet			1
he 's sharing insights today as part of dr. @entity12 's " @entity11 " effort			2
before : at 40 years old , @entity2 called himself " fat , unhappy and fed up			1
" ( @entity14 ) -- i can still remember it , vivid as yesterday			2
it was the eve of my 40th birthday , and i walked upstairs to take a shower			2
as i was trying to catch my breath , i took off my shirt , looked in the mirror and tried to convince myself that i was still that fit guy i had always thought i was			1
somehow , i had been able to skate by on this delusion for all too many years			1
but the denial had finally caught up to me			2
i saw my true reflection , and i could n't lie to myself anymore			2
i was in the worst shape of my life			1
i was fat , unhappy and fed up			2
it 's the typical story			2
first it 's the career			2
then comes marriage , followed by kids			2
your time is no longer your own , and you resign yourself to " maturity , " " filling out " or whatever euphemism for middle age that soothes that idea that you are simply overweight , unfit and unhealthy			1
i 'm here to say that it does n't have to be that way			2
i do n't care how busy you are			2
i do n't care how old you are , how many kids you have or how little time you think you have			1
the power rests within yourself to enact any change in your life you desire			1
and i can say this because i have seen it happen in myself and countless others			2
after that fateful day of clarity , i made a decision to change my life			1
not a vague , wishy - washy notion that i should " get in shape , " maybe " eat better " or possibly " go on a diet , " but rather a specific long - term plan to enhance my wellness in a way that would not only stick , but fit within the parameters of my busy life as a full - time lawyer , husband and father of four small children			1
in my case , it began with a well - researched and supervised seven - day fruit and vegetable juice cleanse ( during which time i weaned myself off caffeine ) , followed by an entirely plant - based nutrition program -- an animal - product - free regimen i have adhered to ever since			1
the immediate result was a rather surprising and unexpected increase in my energy levels , leading to a very gradual return to exercise , building up slowly over an extended period of time			1
the results were hardly overnight			2
but two years later , i had lost well over 30 pounds			1
and not only did i keep the weight off , i was the most fit i had ever been in my life			1
at 42 years old , i competed in the @entity5 , a grueling three - day uber - endurance triathlon circumnavigating the @entity82 that involves 6.2 miles of swimming , 260 miles of cycling and culminates with a 52.4 - mile double marathon run			1
i placed 11th overall and was the third - fastest @entity87			0
to top it off , @entity4 recently named me one of the " 25 @entity88 in the @entity89			1
" ( not that i actually believe i deserve such an honor ! ) quite an extreme contrast from that day i looked in the mirror			1
i 'm not advocating that everyone should test himself or herself so severely			0
but my point is that change starts with a decision followed by baby steps along a new , consistent trajectory that , over time , can lead to dramatic results			1
i 'm not a professional athlete			0
i 'm just a normal family guy			0
but if i could experience such a vast transformation in my own life , i know with certainty that everybody has within himself the power to enact his own well - balanced transformation			1
and despite what you may see advertised , i 'm sorry to say there is no secret diet , mystery pill or overnight miracle that will do it for you			0
but there is a solution			0
here are some helpful tools i employed along the way that can help you get started : set a goal : @entity124 , nonspecific notions of " getting fit , " " going to the gym , " or " eating better " are all fine , but they are not true " goals " and all too typically devolve , paving the way for relapse to old habits			1
instead , establish something very concrete you would like to achieve on a future date			0
the more specific , the better			1
then create a solid plan with reasonable interim " steppingstone " milestones along the way to achieving the larger goal			1
chart your progress , as meeting interim milestones will boost your confidence and invest you more deeply in the ultimate goal			1
create community and accountability : if you go public with your quest , then you are on the hook			0
a good support network is a key to success			0
but beware of the negative dream crushers			0
be selective , surrounding yourself with people who encourage your success			0
do what you love : when it comes to exercise , it should n't be too painful			0
ideally , it should be fun			0
if you absolutely hate running , find something else you enjoy			0
otherwise , you set yourself up to fail			1
and do n't be too rigid -- mix it up with a variety of activities you like to keep it interesting and fresh			0
do n't diet : instead , get honest about your habits and embark on implementing healthy , lasting changes in your nutrition			0
i feel quite strongly that a nutrition program built entirely around plant - based foods and completely devoid of animal products is optimal			0
conventional wisdom would say that an athlete can not perform on plants alone			0
but i am living proof that this is false , and i have ample research to support this position			0
personally , i can not overemphasize the difference this has made in my own life , a secret weapon for enhanced athletic performance and overall long - term wellness			1
( in the last two years , i have not gotten sick or even suffered a cold			1
) i realize , of course , that not everyone is ready to go 100 percent vegan , but a program built on a strong foundation of fresh organic vegetables , fruits and grains should be the focus			0
do n't skip meals , but reduce your portions slightly			0
read the labels and educate yourself			0
avoid saturated fats , processed foods and soft drinks , all of which are entirely devoid of nutritional value			0
eating whole fresh foods high in nutritional content will also stave off those unhealthy urges to binge			0
one day at a time : large goals can seem insurmountable			1
the idea that you can never eat a cupcake or sleep in again is daunting at best			0
instead , just focus on what is happening today , even if it 's hour to hour , and do n't worry about tomorrow			0
" today , i 'm not going to eat that cupcake			0
maybe i 'll eat it tomorrow , just not today			0
" and if you miss a beat , do n't flog yourself ; it only leads to discouragement and quitting altogether			0
the important thing is to make sure you get right back on it the next day -- do n't let another day go by			1
prioritize : take an honest look at your average week , identify your inefficient uses of time and eliminate the things that do n't serve your goals			1
no matter how busy you are , if you are truly honest about this inquiry , i guarantee you can make some cuts and carve out some time			2
remember : nothing changes if nothing changes			0
be consistent : it 's not about how much you do in a given workout or how hard it is			2
ten minutes of core exercises four to five times per week is far better than one long run a week			0
establishing a consistent rhythm of repetition is key , and another reason that your choice of exercise should be something you truly enjoy			2
let 's join together to shift the world 's perspective on long - term health and wellness			0
no matter how old , overweight or out of shape you are , you have the power to make a decision , set a goal and create a plan			1
positive change is always within your grasp , and today still remains the first day of the rest of your life			1
make it count ! the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity2 .			1
