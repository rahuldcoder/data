after questioning and quickly dismissing five jurors saturday morning for reasons ranging from financial hardship to bias , lawyers and the judge began questioning a 22 - year - old man who said he does n't follow the news " because it 's just awful			1
" assistant state 's attorney @entity56 questioned whether the man would be able to bear the grim details of the case			2

" are you absolutely sure you can do it ? " " yes , sir , " the candidate replied			0
" no doubt in your mind ? " @entity56 asked			0
" no , sir , " the man replied			0
when asked by lead defense attorney @entity71 whether his decision would be influenced if @entity26 declines to testify on her own behalf , the candidate said " i can definitely understand not wanting to be up here			1
" the line elicited laughter from nearly everyone in the courtroom , including @entity26			2
@entity26 's lead defense attorney sought to have the man dismissed for failing to disclose an entanglement with the law over apparent marijuana possession , but the judge refused			1
he was ordered to stand by for possible duty			0
@entity16 later approved the dismissal of a man who posted on his @entity9 page what the potential juror said was a joking reference to a " book coming soon " after announcing he had been called for potential jury duty on a big trial			2
" already have the title , cover and all , " assistant state 's attorney @entity94 said in reciting one of the posts			0
also dismissed was a woman who said she had lost a son in a car accident that required an extensive police investigation			0

after extensive questioning by attorneys , he told a grandmother who remembered " sweet pictures " of @entity5 but said she had no preconceived notions of the case to stand by for duty			2
the two other jurors who will be contenders for the final jury pool are a woman in her 60s who does n't own a computer , and a 43 - year - old man who said that while he 's occasionally seen newspaper headlines that suggest @entity26 is guilty , he said he is able to set that aside			1
" i 've also read that @entity127 is an alien , and that @entity129 is still alive and living in @entity130 , " the man said			0
