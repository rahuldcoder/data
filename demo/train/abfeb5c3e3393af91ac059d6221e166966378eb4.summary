-- if you were flipping around your television dial on @entity3 , you saw a lot of news coverage dominated by anchors and pundits sitting in tv studios spouting opinion and analysis			1
on our air , you saw dozens of reporters at polling places around the country , watching for irregularities but also capturing the messy yet miraculous spectacle of democracy in action			2
you saw @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 at election night headquarters , offering behind the scenes details about the candidates and campaigns as they anxiously awaited the verdict of the people			1
you saw @entity31 dissecting the @entity32 and @entity33 outcomes as only someone can who has covered @entity35 for two decades			0
and you saw the maestro of the @entity37 , @entity36 , interpreting the tallies from decisive counties within the swing states minute by minute as they came in , telling you what they meant and how they would shape the electoral map			0
a lot has been written about how cable news has become increasingly dominated by talk and opinion , because that 's what drives tv ratings			2
but as we began our planning for @entity3 more than a year ago , @entity0 decided to go in the opposite direction and double down on our strength : reporting			1
we pared back on the number of analysts in our studio and sent more reporters into the field			0
we invested in new state - of - the - art sets in our @entity62 bureau that allowed us to display electoral data more clearly and vividly than we ever had before			0
we relied on two anchors , @entity65 and @entity66 , who have always been more interested in conducting great correspondents than being soloists themselves			0
we asked our incomparable international reporters to keep track of what the rest of the world was saying about @entity76 's voteâ € ” and we actually put them on our @entity76 airwaves to talk about it			0
we did it because we value facts more than opinions , but also because these days that 's what sets @entity0 apart			1
and we were glad to see that , for this historical night at least , it was what the public appeared to crave as well			1
an average of more than 8.8 million viewers watched the evening 's coverage on our @entity76 network , more than any other cable news network , and others followed it on @entity0 's international networks around the world			1
the reviews are also in , and they tell us that our investment in covering the election as journalists was welcomed			2
" @entity104 on @entity3 , " was only one gratifying headline , on a post by @entity102 , the media critic for the @entity103			0
at @entity0 , we had more than 203 million page views , the highest in four years			2
our social media traffic on @entity107 , @entity108 and other sharing platforms set new records			0
but at @entity0 we 're not ones to dwell over press clippings , good or bad , and so we are already hard at work following up on all the angles that emerged from last night 's result			1
can the parties now come together to address jobs , the deficit , immigration , the environment , relations with @entity121 and @entity122 and all the other pressing problems clouding our future ? or is a $ 6 billion election that left us with the same division of executive and legislative power we had before a recipe for more gridlock ? and what will the demographic winds that carried @entity132 to reelection , despite a sour economy , mean for tomorrow ? how will our future be shaped by a @entity137 population that now accounts for more than 1 in 10 voters , by the empowerment of a generation of young voters who have now turned out in record numbers for two presidential cycles in a row ( and who are driving a slow but steady sea change in acceptance of gay rights ) , by a white electorate that favored @entity150 , but is smaller than it has ever been , by the growing political gap between women , who favored @entity132 by 11 points , and men , who went for @entity150 by 7 points ? and what are we to make of not only the persistent red / blue divide between states , but the growing urban / suburban / rural divisions within states ? all fascinating questions , for our politics and for our society , and ones that will keep us at @entity0 busy and happy providing you with the kind of reporting and story telling we love to do .			1

@entity172 : @entity0 made the choice to focus on reporting for election night coverage
he says the public *wanted* to know the facts , rather than dwell on opinion
@entity172 : election raises *key* questions , worthy of more reporting , about politics , demographics
he asks : can the parties work together on jobs , the deficit , immigration , the environment ?
