an unknown hacker apparently gained access to a 2 - year - old girl 's baby monitor , calling her by name and harassing her , and her parents , with insults and profanity			1
a couple in suburban @entity9 , @entity10 , told @entity12 affiliate @entity11 that , over the weekend , they heard a strange voice in the bedroom shared by their two toddlers			1
when they got there , @entity17 said they realized the voice was coming from the web camera they use to keep tabs on the children			1
what they heard next was ugly			0
" he said , ' wake up @entity28 , you little slut , ' " @entity17 said			0
he said the hacker , who had a @entity34 or @entity35 accent , may have read her name on a wall in the bedroom			0
when he and his wife @entity39 arrived , @entity17 said , the camera swiveled to face them			1
the hacker proceeded to call him a " stupid moron " and his wife a bitch , @entity17 said , before he unplugged the camera			2
the only positive about the situation , he said , is that @entity28 never woke up			2
she was born deaf and has cochlear implants to help her hear , which she was not wearing while sleeping			0
" i felt like somebody broke into your house , " @entity17 said			0
" as a father , i 'm supposed to protect her against people like this			2
so it 's a little embarrassing to say the least , but it 's not going to happen again			0
" baby monitors , particularly those with video capabilities , have been shown in the past to be vulnerable			1
video monitors can broadcast to tvs and hand - held receivers , or over @entity64 to computers , smartphones and tablets			1
in 2009 , an @entity69 family sued the manufacturer of its monitor after they discovered that they and their neighbors could monitor each other 's feeds			2
some newer models have technology that jumps from frequency to frequency , making them more secure , while older monitors do not			0
security experts warn parents to make sure to enable passwords for baby monitors and web cameras			1
most new models are equipped with that ability , they say			0
experts like @entity90 of the @entity92 blog also say to make sure home @entity64 and routers are password - protected			1
" those who ca n't figure this out should ask for help from somebody with security expertise -- somebody they trust with the safety of extremely precious things , " @entity90 said			0
in comments on the @entity11 article about the hack , @entity17 said he did take basic security precautions : " the router was password protected and the firewall was enabled			1
the ip camera was also password protected , " he said			1
" of course , devices may well be protected by passwords , but default passwords that have n't been changed are like having no password at all , as other commenters pointed out , " wrote @entity90 on the @entity92 blog			1
multiple security experts have identified the camera model shown in the @entity9 news report as a @entity118			1
a faq page on the manufacturer 's site lists the default user name and password -- both " admin " -- for the camera , as well as the default port used to connect it to the @entity128			1
altering those default settings " with a non-trivial password would make the device far more difficult to access , and probably too much trouble to bother with , " wrote technology and security analyst @entity130 for tech blog @entity131			2
" if you want to go even further and make it really hard for attackers , you can change the default port			0
" @entity130 said that anyone on the internet could build a scanner that would find cameras still hooked up to their default port			0
they could then check those cameras to see if they still open using the default password			0
" this is almost certainly what happened , " he wrote			0
earlier this year , researchers at security firm @entity152 used the @entity118 in a demonstration of how @entity128 - enabled cameras can be exploited			2
@entity155 did not immediately respond wednesday to a message seeking comment for this story .			0
