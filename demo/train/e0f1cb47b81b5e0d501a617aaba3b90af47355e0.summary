@entity0 , and she asked me , " what is it about testosterone that gets us into war ? " there is no doubt that women can fight			1
they do so every day in @entity17 and @entity18			0
though not permitted in the infantry in the @entity21 , they have seen plenty of action on a battlefield with no fronts			0
some men , maybe not so much			2
in his correspondence between 1886 and 1898 , for example , @entity29 wrote enthusiastically about the prospect of war with @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity29 may have been an extreme example -- charging up @entity41 's @entity40 , he exulted , " @entity42 , what fun ! " -- but he was hardly unusual in his eagerness for combat			1
when war against @entity38 was declared in april 1898 , president @entity46 asked for 125,000 volunteers			1
he got over a million young @entity21 men almost overnight			2
in those days , women were not permitted in the armed services			0
but what if they had been ? do women share the yearning for combat that has defined so many young men in so many societies , all through time ? i am tempted to say that women would be less likely to get us into wars			1
but then i remember queen elizabeth i ( if you ca n't , just picture @entity61 in body armor ) , @entity36 prime minister @entity64 ( saying to president @entity66 before the @entity67 , " now , @entity66 , do n't go wobbly on me " ) and @entity68 , prime minister of israel during the @entity69 ( ordering revenge for the 1972 @entity72 slaying of @entity74 athletes )			1
does anyone doubt that gun - toting @entity76 would be ready to fight anyone , anytime ? @entity78 ? still , i think women do not have the same primitive urge to test themselves in combat			1
back in @entity29 's time , upper - class men in particular were determined to prove their manhood , fearful that they might be somehow exposed as weak and effeminate			1
this was particularly evident in @entity29 's correspondence			1
he scoffs at his political foes as " hermaphrodites " : roughly , half - woman , half - man			0
curiously , however , @entity29 was introduced to the mythology and glories of war by a woman			1
@entity95 was the widow and sister of two great @entity98 heroes and martyrs , @entity100 and @entity101			0
( you may remember @entity101 's fatal charge with his doomed black regiment from the movie " glory " )			0
the young @entity95 , a family friend of the @entity107 ' , would visit wearing her widow 's weeds and thrill little @entity29 with the exploits of her martyred menfolk			1
in her old age , @entity112 turned against war			0
she had the wisdom to see that a war to free the slaves in @entity21 was noble but that foreign adventuring in @entity41 and the @entity119 had more to do with the atavistic urges of men than wise policy or moral duty			1
indeed , women may respond to the test of their essential identity in a less macho fashion then men			1
although there were reportedly some problems with having women in the frontline units of the early @entity74 army , women fought courageously and well in the @entity135 army against @entity37 in @entity136 in the @entity21 military , women have taken on dangerous jobs			0
after some initial resistance , women fliers have been accepted by the brotherhood of naval aviators and air force pilots			0
in the movie " @entity146 , " about a brave helicopter pilot in @entity67 played by @entity148 , the men are shocked when @entity149 cries			2
there is a wonderful scene in which @entity149 tells the men to stop staring			0
" it 's just tears			0
it does n't mean anything , " she snaps			0
women are no less courageous than male soldiers , but they sometimes have less need to show off			2
they certainly can bring a certain sense of humor that is useful in deflating male egos			0
after @entity29 rode up @entity40 with his rough riders , his wife , @entity164 , went to @entity41 to tour the battlefield			2
when she returned , she slyly told her husband that the hill of his famous charge was not quite as high as she had been led to believe			0
it is not known whether @entity29 laughed			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2

@entity174 was asked , " what is it about testosterone that gets us into war ? "
he says women brave , prudent ; *historically* , men , like @entity29 , eager for combat
women can make war ( @entity64 , @entity68 ) but lack men 's macho urge to test themselves
@entity174 : women tend to have have less need to show off
