-- a nurse who was quarantined at a hospital in @entity5 after returning from @entity6 was released monday , her attorney said			1
@entity7 , who told @entity0 the quarantine was violating her rights , was discharged after testing negative for @entity10			1
also on monday , a 5 - year - old boy who recently visited @entity6 and had a fever tested negative for the virus in @entity14 , according to health officials			1
the boy , who was running a temperature , was with his mother at @entity14 's @entity19 , said dr. @entity20 , president of the @entity21 , which oversees @entity19			1
nurse to return to @entity23 @entity7 was put in isolation friday after returning to @entity5 from a month in @entity25			1
her quarantine , part of a days - old policy the governors of @entity14 and @entity5 instituted for all health care workers who 've had contact with @entity10 patients in @entity6 , has been criticized widely by health care experts			1
on sunday , she spoke by phone with @entity0 's @entity36 and @entity37			0
" this is an extreme that is really unacceptable , and i feel like my basic human rights have been violated , " @entity7 said			1
she said she was flummoxed as to how @entity5 gov. @entity41 , who has no medical training , could describe her as " obviously ill. " @entity7 will return to @entity23 , and arrangements for her travel are still being worked out , her attorney , @entity43 , told @entity0			1
@entity43 said there 's a " legal basis " to challenge the quarantine policies in @entity5 and in @entity14 , but the nurse is n't sure she wants to do so			1
each state has a different quarantine law , said @entity52 , an attorney who helped rewrite @entity54 's quarantine law so the state could more easily respond to outbreaks			0
the @entity58 @entity57 gives states authority over how to approach health matters , though the federal government has control over what happens concerning public health in airports and shipping ports , @entity52 said			2
mandatory quarantines -- now what ? @entity69 issues new guidelines on monday , the @entity58 @entity69 released updated guidance for people who might have been exposed to the ebola virus			1
" the new guidelines increase the level of protection by outlining different levels of exposure and outlining different public health actions that can be taken for each of those levels of exposure , " @entity69 director dr. @entity74 told reporters			1
someone who had direct contact of infected body fluids , for instance , would be classified as high risk			0
someone would be considered low risk if she traveled on an airplane with a person showing symptoms of @entity10			2
@entity74 has long argued against travel restrictions , saying they could hurt the global health community 's effort to tamp down the @entity6 outbreak			2
" we 're far from out of the woods			0
in each of the three heavily affected countries in @entity6 , we 're seeing definite signs of progress , but still be a long hard fight , " he said			0
what states are doing the director of the @entity69 said that active 21 - day monitoring began monday in the six states where about 70 % of air travelers enter the @entity58 from @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity25 , hard - hit countries in @entity6			1
those states are @entity14 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity54 , @entity5 and @entity118			1
the three - week period marks the maximum incubation time for @entity10			1
state and local officials will maintain daily contact with all travelers from the three affected countries for the entire 21 days after the last possible date of exposure to ebola virus , @entity74 said			2
authorities will require travelers to report their temperatures and the presence or absence of @entity10 symptoms aside from a fever , he explained , and they will be required to coordinate with public health officials if they intend to travel and to make arrangements to have their temperatures monitored during travel in a manner acceptable to state and local health officials			1
@entity144 's full remarks @entity14 , @entity5 and @entity145 say anyone returning from having direct contact with @entity10 patients in @entity6 will have to be quarantined for 21 days			1
@entity117 officials will monitor the health of all travelers returning from @entity112 , @entity25 and @entity113 , gov. @entity153 's office said			2
the effort will build on state and local health departments ' outreach and monitoring , according to a statement that explains more about the process			2
illinois gov. @entity162 's office said the quarantine would be a " home quarantine			0
" " this protective measure is too important to be voluntary , " @entity162 said			0
on friday , @entity166 and @entity41 announced a mandatory quarantine for people who had been in @entity6 and had contact there with people infected with @entity10			2
@entity41 said such returning health care workers who are @entity5 residents could be quarantinefd in their homes as long as they did not have symptoms consistent with @entity10			1
@entity41 said monday that he was glad that @entity7 had been released from quarantine			1
" the reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic			2
if you live in @entity5 , you 're quarantined in your home			2
that 's always been the policy			0
if you live outside the state , and you 're symptomatic , we 're not letting you go onto public transportation			0
it makes no common sense			0
the minute she was no longer symptomatic , she was released			0
" @entity54 is implementing an " active monitoring program " for all returning passengers from @entity113 , @entity112 and @entity25 , " with a special emphasis on returning health care workers , " @entity54 governor 's spokesman @entity190 has said			1
should health care workers be quarantined ? could quarantines backfire ? arguments against the quarantines are that they could deter health care workers from traveling to @entity6 to fight @entity10 and could greatly hurt their livelihoods			1
" i 'm concerned of the disincentive for the health care workers " to travel to @entity6 , said dr. @entity202 , director of the @entity203 at the @entity204			1
" if i lose three weeks on my return and do n't get to do the work i 'm supposed to do ... means this would n't be workable for me , " said dr. @entity207 , a pediatric immunologist at @entity208			0
an expert who has studied @entity10 for more than a decade , @entity213 's @entity212 , told @entity0 on monday that he feels the policy on mandatory quarantines in @entity14 and @entity5 are " largely political " rather than medical fact and that leaders are acting based on the desire to calm a panicked public rather than to do what 's most beneficial			1
@entity222 was even more direct			0
" forced quarantine of asymptomatic health workers returning from fighting the @entity10 outbreak in @entity6 is not grounded on scientific evidence and could undermine efforts to curb the epidemic at its source , " the group said			1
@entity231 , @entity58 ambassador to the @entity232 , is traveling in ebola - affected nations in @entity6			0
" ambassador @entity231 and the traveling party were obviously aware of the discussions of potential quarantines by state and local officials prior to departure and will , of course , be prepared to abide by requirements upon return			2
" that said , they are also in close contact with the @entity69 , with medical experts and are taking absolutely every precaution to stay safe and to avoid contracting the disease , a risk that pales in comparison to the risk we take if the international community does not take further action , " said @entity244 , spokeswoman for the @entity245			2
doctor with @entity10 at @entity19 @entity19 is also where @entity10 - positive @entity14 doctor @entity259 , 33 , is in isolation			1
he is in serious but stable condition monday , according to @entity20			0
@entity259 arrived home in the @entity58 on october 17 after spending time in @entity113			0
because he 'd had contact with @entity10 patients , @entity259 took pains to limit his interaction with others , but he did go places and spend time with friends			2
@entity259 's fiancee , @entity271 , had been under quarantine at @entity19 , but doctors said she did not have the virus and has no symptoms , said @entity276 , the city @entity277 spokeswoman			0
" we learned a lot from @entity285 , " @entity20 said , referring to all that went wrong in @entity280 when a @entity112 national arrived from @entity6 with @entity10 and two nurses treating him contracted the virus			2
according to a hospital worker with direct knowledge of the situation , there were not enough nurses on staff at @entity19 to handle both @entity293 and @entity10 patients , so patients in the adult and pediatric @entity293 were transferred to @entity296 for further treatment			1
pediatric patients were transferred monday , while the adult patients were transferred over the weekend			0
they needed the nurses , not the space , the worker said			0
elsewhere , a potential @entity10 patient was transferred to the @entity305 in @entity306			1
" they are appropriately isolated and receiving further assessment and care , " the hospital tweeted on monday			2
how the ebola virus spreads @entity10 and the @entity58 military on sunday , the @entity313 would not say whether it 's willing to still send an active - duty military @entity10 response team to states ordering mandatory quarantine for @entity10 health care workers			1
the 30 - person team finishes training monday and will then be ready for deployment on 72 hours ' notice			0
defense secretary @entity323 would have to approve any deployment			0

@entity330 authorities met @entity326 ' plane " in full @entity69 gear , " an official said , referring to the type of protective equipment health care workers wear when dealing with @entity10			1
there is no indication that any team members have the virus			0
they will be monitored for 21 days at a separate location at a @entity58 military installation in @entity347 , @entity330 , according to military officials			0
it 's not yet clear if family members can visit them			0
" the army chief of staff has directed a 21 - day controlled monitoring period for all redeploying soldiers returning from @entity355			0
he has done this out of caution to ensure soldiers , family members and their surrounding communities including host nations are confident that we are taking all steps necessary to protect their health , " the @entity356 said in a statement			0
@entity0 's @entity367 , @entity37 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , dr. @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 and @entity379 contributed to this report .			0
