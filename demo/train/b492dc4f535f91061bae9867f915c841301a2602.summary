-- with @entity1 just around the corner , this week seemed like a great time to give a tip of our caps to stay - at - home moms , including these four who used clever ideas to become business moguls			1
@entity12 : of course only a mother could found such a successful baby food company ! in the late 1920s , @entity15 mom @entity12 was hand - straining food for her baby daughter , @entity17 , when she realized there must be some way to avoid the messy task			1
she pointed out to her husband , @entity21 , that if his family 's business , the @entity22 , could puree a tomato all day long , its equipment could probably make short work of other fruits and veggies , too			2
@entity30 realized his wife was on to something , and after a year of experimentation -- and an extensive search to find the right drawing for their label 's now - iconic " @entity36 " - the @entity39 introduced their first line of baby foods , a super-yummy menu of strained peas , carrots , prunes , and spinach			1
@entity0 : 6 unforgettable movie mothers @entity48 : when @entity52 , @entity51 mom @entity48 went looking for educational materials for her newborn daughter in 1996 , she found a disappointing hole in the baby market : there were n't really any educational materials to expose babies to music and the arts			1
some parents would just accept whatever the market was offering			0
she shot a video for her daughter in her basement then edited it with her husband , @entity71 , on the family computer			0
she even doodled a logo for the video at her kitchen table			0
within a year , the first baby einstein video was in stores , and the series quickly became a runaway hit			0
@entity80 bought the company in 2001 after @entity48 raked in $ 12 million in revenue the previous year			1
after the sale @entity66 gave an interview to the @entity85 in which she sounded a little surprised by her huge windfall			0
" i was just a stay - at - home mom who wanted to expose my daughter to classical music , poetry , not a budding entrepreneur			1
" @entity0 : 6 other animals dogs will adopt mrs. @entity95 : @entity97 was a young stay - at - home mom when she started to feel restless in 1977			1
she had always loved baking cookies , so she figured she might try her hand at opening a cookie store			0
the concept does n't sound odd now that there 's seemingly a mrs. @entity97 outlet in every mall you walk into , but at the time the notion that a store would only sell cookies seemed absurd			2
furthermore , @entity97 was only 20 years old and did n't have any business experience			2
@entity97 nevertheless managed to secure financing for her venture and she opened up her first cookie shop in @entity113 , @entity114			0
fields and her husband , @entity116 , soon confirmed their suspicions that people really enjoy cookies and will gladly drop a few bucks to get a warm one			0
the company began a sweeping franchising program , and in the @entity124 sold her cookie empire to an investment firm			2
@entity0 : people who switched careers after 50 ( and thrived ) @entity129 : put this one on the list of brilliant niche markets we did n't know existed : baby legwarmers			0
@entity134 managed to turn that very idea into a fabulously successful company			1
in april 2005 @entity134 found a new weapon in her ongoing battle with her daughter 's diaper rashes			1
by letting her daughter enjoy some of what they called " nakedy butt time , " the rash got some much - needed fresh air , but the tot 's legs got cold			1
@entity134 combatted this chilliness by cutting up a pair of socks to make improvised baby legwarmers			2
@entity134 quickly realized that the legwarmers had all sorts of side benefits			0
they did more than just keep her daughter 's legs toasty ; they also protected the baby 's legs when she crawled and made changing diapers a breeze			1
@entity134 whipped up some stylish designs and began selling @entity165 to other moms			1
babylegs proved to be an incredibly lucrative idea			0
in 2008 the company moved over $ 4 million worth of its legwarmers worldwide , and in april 2009 @entity171 bought a majority stake in the company and began aggressively expanding the company 's reach			2
