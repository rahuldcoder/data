-- despite spending more per person on health care than any other country , @entity1 are getting sicker and dying younger than our international peers -- a problem persisting across all ages and both genders , according to a new report			1
in 2011 , the @entity11 found life expectancy in the @entity1 was increasing at a slower rate than in other high - income democracies			1
shortly after , the @entity11 and @entity15 convened a panel of experts to investigate why			1
the panel was given 18 months to review recent health studies from 16 " peer countries " : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , the @entity35 and the @entity36			1
the panel released its report , titled " @entity39 in international perspective : @entity41 , @entity42 , " on wednesday			2
" our panel was unprepared for the gravity of the finding we uncovered , " chair @entity43 wrote in the report 's preface			2
" we hope that others will take notice			0
" lagging behind this is not a new problem , @entity43 noted on a conference call about the report			0
" it 's been going on since 1980 and it 's getting progressively worse			0
" data from 2007 show @entity1 ' life expectancy is 3.7 years shorter for men and 5.2 years shorter for women than in the leading nations -- @entity34 for men and @entity29 for women			1
as of 2011 , 27 countries had higher life expectancies at birth than the @entity1			1
" the tragedy is not that the @entity1 is losing a contest with other countries , " the report states , " but that @entity1 are dying and suffering from illness and injury at rates that are demonstrably unnecessary			1
" @entity1 does rank well in some health measures , according to the panel			1
the @entity1 has higher cancer survival rates , lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lower smoking prevalence rates than many of its peer countries			1
those @entity1 who make it to age 75 will survive longer than their peers in the comparison countries			1
global report : obesity bigger health crisis than hunger but that 's where the good news stops			0
the report outlines nine health areas where the @entity1 lags behind other rich nations , including infant mortality , homicides , teen pregnancy , drug - related deaths , obesity and disabilities			1
@entity1 have the highest prevalence of @entity104 in the group			2
seniors are at a greater risk of developing and dying from heart disease			0
and our children are less likely than children in peer countries to reach their fifth birthday			0
" many of these conditions have a particularly profound effect on young people , reducing the odds that @entity1 will live to age 50 , " the report states			2
" and for those who reach age 50 , these conditions contribute to poorer health and greater illness later in life			0
" why ? " the sheer systemic nature of the problem , that affects so many health outcomes across the whole lifespan , surprised all of us , " said panel member @entity125			2
" it seems to be a whole bunch of things acting together			0
" it 's easy to point a finger at our health care system , which unlike comparison countries ' does not provide universal coverage			0
as a result , lower income and less educated people often receive poorer care			0
" the @entity1 health system is highly fragmented , with limited public health and primary care resources and a large uninsured population , " the authors wrote			2
" compared with people in other countries , @entity1 are more likely to find care inaccessible or unaffordable			1
" opinion : finding the jugaad for @entity1 health care but the panel says that 's not all that 's to blame			1
studies show even white , insured , college - educated @entity1 are sicker than their peers in @entity160			1
the experts gave three other possible causes for the country 's growing health disadvantage : though @entity1 know what 's " good " for them , few act on it			1
although we are less likely to smoke and drink heavily than our peers , we consume more calories , have higher rates of drug abuse , are less likely to use seat belts and are more likely to use guns in acts of violence , according to the report			2
most high - income countries report income and education disparities in their health care system			2
but the panel said @entity1 benefit much less from social programs that could negate the effects of poverty			1
" in countries with the most favorable health outcomes , resource investments and infrastructure often reflect a strong societal commitment to the health and welfare of the entire population , " the report states			0
our environment is also a big contributor to @entity1 ' poor health , the panel said			1
@entity1 communities are built around automobiles , discouraging physical activity and increasing traffic accidents			2
contraceptives are only available by prescription , instead of over the counter			0
even stress could play a role -- adding to our waistlines , substance abuse and criminal behavior			0
moving forward " it would be a mistake for people to respond to this by saying we need to spend more money on health care , " @entity43 said			0
he noted that our peer countries spend significantly less , but appear to be spending it more effectively			0
where in the world can you get universal health care ? with " lives and dollars " at stake , the report made several recommendations for the future			0
the experts asked the @entity231 to join with international partners to improve the quality of research that could be used to compare peer countries around the world			2
they also recommended the @entity231 commission research on health policies that have been successful in our peer countries that could potentially be used in the @entity1			1
waiting for more research is n't the answer , @entity43 said			0
individuals can make changes now , listening to advice about healthy diets and exercise , or making sure to wear their seat belts			0
as for policy , the panel hopes this report will open a broader discussion about what we value as a nation .			0
