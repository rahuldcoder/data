an @entity1 lawmaker says people will not be fined $ 500 for wearing hooded sweatshirts in public , despite some interpretations of a proposed law concerning hoods and masks			1
it is already against the law in @entity1 to wear a " mask , hood or covering " that conceals the wearer 's identity during the commission of a crime or for the purpose of harassment or intimidation			0
@entity23 state sen. @entity22 's @entity21 would make it a crime to wear a " robe , mask or other disguise " in public that would " intentionally conceal the wearer 's identity			1
" violators would face fines from $ 50 to $ 500			0
since the bill was introduced in december , some have interpreted it to include hooded sweatshirts , or " hoodies			1
" media reports have also said that the bill includes " hoodies , " though it is not immediately clear from where this interpretation came			2
but @entity22 points out that the word " hoodie " is not mentioned in the legislation , except for the reference to hoods in the first section			0
" the bill is not designed to ban hoodies , but to prevent the wearing of masks or disguises in the commission of a crime , " @entity22 said in a statement			1
the measure provides a number of exceptions , including religious garments , @entity60 celebrations , parades , weather protection and other circumstances			0
because hooded garments , or hoodies , are often worn as weather protection and not for the purposes of intentional concealment , it is unlikely they would be considered a disguise under the bill , he said in an email			2
" the proposal is intended to protect law abiding citizens , not limit their rights , " he said			0
" this is simply an attempt to combat crime and make businesses and public spaces safer for everyone			1
" no states or counties have active legislation banning hooded sweatshirts or " hoodies			1
" but schools , businesses and government buildings have been able to institute their own bans on hooded sweatshirts			2
the bill will be considered when @entity1 's legislative session begins in february			0
it has to be heard and passed out of committee during the early weeks of february to move onto to the full @entity95 and then the @entity96 .			0

some interpret bill banning robes or masks in public spaces to include hooded sweatshirts
@entity23 state sen. @entity22 says bill " not designed to ban hoodies "
