-- on wednesday , @entity1 is expected to unveil the newest version of its @entity3 with all of the breathless hype that typically attends the consumer - tech juggernaut 's public events			1
but some folks , many of them @entity1 customers and self - described fanboys and fangirls , are n't celebrating			0
instead , they 're calling on the company to shore up human rights concerns by manufacturing an " ethical @entity3 3			1
" the creator of a campaign asking @entity1 to ensure safer conditions for workers at the @entity18 plants that make its products is asking supporters to take to @entity22 on wednesday , posting pleas to @entity1 on the @entity25 @entity22 page			1
last month , @entity26 , a self - described " @entity1 person , " started a petition on @entity28			2
the petition has more than 241,000 signatures and asks , among other things , for @entity1 to create a worker - protection strategy around the release of new products such as the anticipated new @entity3			1
worker - rights groups say that @entity36 , the @entity18 manufacturer that produces products for @entity1 and other tech companies , has a stringent , militaristic culture of surveillance and obedience			1
it 's a culture that labor groups say contributed to a slew of suicides in 2010 at the company 's @entity47 plant -- prompting @entity36 to install nets in an effort to prevent employees from jumping -- as well as worker injuries and even deaths			0
" many of the people who have signed @entity26 's petition have expressed concern that without a strategy to prevent forced overtime , impossible production quotas and worker injury , that worker abuse , accidents , and even death may increase around the release of the @entity3 3 , " said @entity58 , campaign director at @entity28			1
" @entity26 hopes that if @entity1 customers ask the company about how the @entity3 was made , @entity1 will respond to his request for a worker protection strategy for new product releases			2
" @entity26 was traveling tuesday and not able to be reached for comment			0
contacted by @entity0 on tuesday , @entity1 did not have any comment			0
in a statement to @entity0 last month , @entity1 said it cares about all of the workers in its worldwide supply chain			2
" we insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions , treat workers with dignity and respect and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever @entity1 products are made , " the company said			1
" our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with @entity1			0
" after a wave of publicity last month that included a @entity0 interview with a @entity36 worker , @entity36 announced it had given workers a pay increase and was allowing an international labor - rights group to visit one of its facilities			0
@entity58 said @entity26 has never gotten a response from @entity1 about creating a worker protection strategy , even though he was promised one by the manager at a @entity102 , @entity101 where he delivered the petition			0
@entity26 and @entity58 are asking supporters on wednesday to post on the @entity25 page on @entity22 " asking for an ethical @entity3			1
" @entity1 has not officially said what wednesday 's announcement will be , but all speculation centers on a new @entity3			2
many reports suggest it may actually be called the @entity3 to showcase a new , high - resolution display screen .			0
