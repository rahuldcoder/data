-- last weekend @entity1 was hailing the beginning of a " new era " at @entity4 after a rout of @entity6			1
sunday saw a sobering reality check for the @entity8 and his expensively - assembled " galacticos " as the @entity11 powerhouses surrendered a 3 - 1 lead to lose 5 - 3 to newly - promoted @entity13			1
it had looked an improbable scenario at the @entity16 as @entity4 's attacking prowess was on full display with @entity19 setting up @entity20 for a headed opener before record signing @entity22 made it 2 - 0 with a delightful chip			1
the first danger signs came after @entity13 's new talisman @entity25 headed home to reduce the deficit , but when another @entity4 summer signing @entity29 re-opened the two - goal with a clever back heel , the three points were there for the taking			1
but then in @entity1 's words " we made big errors " and the unheralded home team took full advantage			0
referee @entity38 awarded a contentious penalty after @entity40 pulled back @entity41 and @entity42 struck it home			0
@entity13 soon leveled as @entity44 was allowed time to pick out @entity45 to stab past @entity46			2
@entity47 had come on as a substitute for @entity22 , but he was caught napping by @entity49 , who found @entity41 to put @entity13 ahead			2
a miserable afternoon for @entity4 was rounded off when young defender @entity50 hacked down the rampant @entity41 and was red carded			2
@entity51 beat @entity46 from the spot to complete a remarkable reversal and push @entity13 up to seventh in the standings			1
@entity4 , hoping to win @entity56 qualification for next season , languishes in 12th			2
@entity1 , who was talking of the @entity11 title after the 4 - 0 win over @entity6 , must have believed it might be a reality after his side 's superb opening			2
" we started well and score fantastic goals , " he told @entity64			0
but he acknowledged that the frailties which emerged in the second half were of his team 's own making			0
" we have too many players who just want to score goals			0
" we have to look to ourselves because we made such big errors as a team an personally , " he admitted			0
@entity13 manager @entity74 was still pinching himself after the victory			2
" at the moment it 's difficult to believe			0
" today 's result and performance will suggest that on the day we can be a difficult opponent			0
" later in the afternoon , there was a dramatic end to the early title showdown at the @entity84 between champions @entity85 and current leaders @entity88			1
@entity13 had 10 - men after a red card for @entity91 and trailed to an @entity93 goal when former @entity88 star @entity94 equalized with virtually his first touch of the ball after coming on as a late replacement			1
@entity94 spent 13 years at @entity88 before joining a new franchise in @entity99 , who then loaned him out to @entity13 , and his celebration of the goal was muted			1
" i am a little lost for words			0
i did n't expect to come on and score like that , " he told the @entity105 's @entity104			0
" i came on and the @entity88 fans were singing , and that 's emotional			2
then i am playing for this club , who have taken me in brilliantly as well , so i am really stuck in the middle here			0
" @entity88 still tops the standings by three points from @entity114 and @entity115 after five rounds , but its 100 % record was surrendered by the late strike			1
on an afternoon of surprises , @entity119 moved off the bottom with a 1 - 0 away win at @entity123 , while @entity124 stunned @entity125 3 - 2 at @entity126			1
meanwhile , in the @entity128 , one of @entity1 's former teams @entity127 maintained its 100 % start to the season with a thumping 5 - 0 win at @entity133			1
it did not quite match the 8 - 2 drubbing handed out by arch rivals @entity135 to @entity136 saturday , but was @entity127 's fourth straight victory to take a two - point lead over @entity139			1
@entity140 set up @entity141 for the opener , but missed a penalty after being fouled by @entity144 , who was sent off			0
@entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity140 with the fifth completed the scoring .			0

@entity13 beat @entity4 5 - 3 after a remarkable turn around
@entity4 led 3 - 1 until a late @entity13 goal spree
@entity94 equalizes for @entity85 against old side @entity88
@entity127 tops @entity128 with thrashing of @entity133
