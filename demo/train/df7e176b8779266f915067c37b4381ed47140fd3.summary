-- your friends do n't need to know about every song you hear on the radio			0
that 's the position @entity6 has taken toward a new @entity8 feature that lets users automatically publish information to their profiles about songs they listen to , videos they watch and articles they read			1
@entity6 , which makes the popular personalized internet radio service , is n't just concerned about clutter in your @entity8 friends ' news feeds			1
some listeners could feel violated when they learn that an application is broadcasting information about their activities , @entity6 executives said			2
" it 's true that music is a social experience , but it 's also a very private experience , " @entity6 founder @entity24 said in a recent phone interview			1
" we have to be very cautious			0
" @entity8 is poised to release new features at a news conference on wednesday that will allow users to automatically publish information from other websites and apps to their timeline profiles , according to a person familiar with the project			1
these will go beyond the @entity41 app that 's already available , the person said			1
for example , a fitness program that tracks physical activities could send @entity8 an update after a long jog			2
the plans were reported earlier by the website @entity48			0
a @entity8 spokesman declined to comment			2
at a news conference in september , @entity8 ceo @entity50 said people would benefit from publishing more data and letting computer algorithms sort out what 's important			1
" no activity is too big or too small to share , " @entity50 said			0
" you do n't have to ' like ' a movie			0
you just watch a movie			0
" @entity8 will press on without the support of some major app makers , such as @entity62 , whose @entity64 software is the no. 1 digital jukebox			1
an @entity62 spokesman did not respond to a request for comment			0
a spokeswoman for @entity71 , an app that creates personalized magazines from social network feeds , has said the company does n't plan to send information to @entity8 about every article users read and will instead let users selectively post with a share button			2
she said people probably would n't want to broadcast everything			0
@entity6 has supported many of @entity8 's platform development efforts in the past			1
@entity6 launched @entity8 sharing features when they were first rolled out and was among the first to support @entity8 's @entity87 , which automatically recognizes a @entity6 visitor 's @entity8 account			1
" we have a great relationship with @entity8 , " a @entity6 spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail			1
" we continue to be excited about what they are doing and more generally about the social dimension of music -- for example , there are a host of great new social features on the new @entity6 site that we launched in september			2
" @entity6 's feed can be tweaked or edited by each user , but only includes information when a user creates a new radio station or bookmarks or clicks the thumbs - up button on a particular song or artist			1
it does n't post a feed of every song that plays			0
@entity8 lets users manage which apps can publish to their profiles using a page called the @entity119			2
in an interview with reporters in september , @entity8 cto @entity120 said the company 's long - term goal is to have every app support the auto - publish features			1
earlier partners have said that the tools have brought in hordes of newcomers to their websites			0
@entity6 is one of many that is reluctant to sign on , but its absence from @entity41 is noticeable			1
" there is a segment for sure that wants to really promiscuously share and wants to hear about everything that their friends are listening to , " @entity6 cto @entity136 told a small audience at a technology conference recently			0
however , they make up a minority , he said			0
" there is a really large percentage of the @entity6 audience that actually are n't interested at all in what their friends are listening to , " @entity136 said			0
" they do n't want to spam their entire social network with things they 're discovering			0

@entity6 does not plan to support @entity41 and its auto - publish features
@entity8 will launch more " *frictionless* sharing " features on wednesday , a *source* says
@entity62 's @entity64 also does not *participate* in @entity41
