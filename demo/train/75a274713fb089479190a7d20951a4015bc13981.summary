-- the urban planning equivalent of a @entity3 test , a " @entity5 " can be taken to mean almost anything			2
but by the most popular criteria ; sustainable energy and development , open data and government , and integrated information , communications and technology ( @entity14 ) serving wide areas of a city , these ultra-modern hubs are on the rise			1
industrial analysts @entity20 claim predict there will be 88 cities that fit the description by 2025 , up from 21 today , taking in contenders far from the usual suspects of @entity27 and @entity28			1
these dynamic new players hope to redraw the map			2
@entity31 , @entity32 while sister city @entity34 has been lauded for its sustainability practices , the capital has used pioneering data analysis to address its longstanding issues with pollution and congestion			2
improvements in walkways and a widespread bike - sharing scheme have led to reduced car use , with noise pollution falling almost 10 decibels since 2005			2
the city has also benefited from the @entity48 mass transit bus system and a fleet of electric taxis			0
@entity51 , @entity52 the new oasis in the @entity55 desert was supposed to have been the first zero carbon , zero waste city , and if such ambition is yet to be realized there is still much to admire			0
it is home to the region 's largest solar power plant , serving all its energy needs with @entity66 of clean electricity each year			1
autonomous vehicles handle transportation needs , while water and electricity use is monitored for efficiency with high - tech sensors			0
@entity74 , @entity75 a recent @entity77 paper on infrastructure in the @entity75 capital indicates some of the radical improvements to be undertaken , including mass transit systems fitted with intelligent technologies to better regulate the city 's traffic issues			1
locally - sourced renewable energy will tackle blackout problems and enable growth , such as for the $ 40 million @entity88 , intended to become a world class tech hub			1
@entity90 , @entity91 president @entity93 's " @entity92 , " which he describes as the grandest national initiative for a century			0
his government is investing over $ 1 billion in the north highlands site , anticipating its gains would extend the rest of the nation			0
a new university campus , modelled on @entity102 tech cities , would develop elite engineering , energy and biotechnology projects , complete with extensive education and research facilities			1
@entity108 , @entity109 the " @entity109 @entity118 " is already a hub of over 100 software companies , from startups to @entity114 and @entity77 branches , with thousands of local students graduating with @entity117 degrees			0
it will soon receive a major upgrade through the @entity122 development on a 400 hectare grid , wired full of advanced communications , data - gathering sensors , renewable energy , and transport networks			1
@entity128 , @entity129 with @entity129 set to become the world 's most populous nation , ambitious plans are underway for new urban development with prime minister @entity134 promising 100 smart cities			1
@entity128 , in the western state of @entity137 , would serve as test case			0
a smart grid is to be constructed on an area twice the size of @entity142 , designated a special investment region ( sir ) , which would be managed from central command centers with high speed transit routes			1
@entity147 , @entity148 the government 's commitment to open data means that citizens can access most municipal services online , and that figured can be analyzed as a basis for policy initiatives			0
this has enabled intelligent transport management systems and a plan for energy efficiencies that could cut carbon emissions by 19 % by 2030			1
the city has committed to tie infrastructure development to carbon reduction , including " area greening " in residential areas			0
@entity167 , @entity168 the @entity171 state 's efforts to expand beyond @entity172 before @entity173 could hinge on this brand - new metropolis to the @entity175			1
a reported $ 45 billion will be spent on @entity167 , powered by one of the world 's most extravagant hydrocarbon centers , completed with luxury marina , commerce and entertainment zones			0
@entity182 , @entity183 one of @entity185 's most upwardly mobile hubs benefits from one of the fastest internet connections in the world , and recently received an @entity77 grant as part of the ' @entity192 ' project			1
this is earmarked for upgrading transport and its management , as well the development of data - based infrastructure			2
a new tech park for gaming , big data , and cyber security companies will press its credentials further			0
@entity203 , @entity204 the island is developing a technology and business park in the village of @entity203 at a cost of almost $ 300 million , with @entity14 and robotics among the emerging businesses			0
the special zone uses advanced monitoring systems to manage energy and water , with buildings architecturally designed to maximize efficiency			2
ultra-fast broadband and a low tax , pro-business government are also geared to attracting new investment .			0

' smart cities ' are set to *quadruple* over the next decade
@entity185 , the @entity171 , and @entity225 among the *hotspots*
entire cities being built on smart grids for intelligent transport , communications , and energy *transmission*
