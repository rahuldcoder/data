@entity0 -- doctors and patients have a new tool to prevent breast cancer : a drug that is already approved for the treatment of the disease			1
women who are at high risk for breast cancer that is fueled by the hormone estrogen could reduce their risk of getting cancer by taking the hormone - blocking drug @entity15 , according to a study presented at a conference in @entity0 on saturday			1
" we proved that exemestane ( @entity15 ) reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 65 % , " said lead author dr. @entity18 , who is a breast cancer specialist at @entity21 's @entity20			1
@entity18 presented his research at the annual conference of the @entity27			0
the study has also been published in the @entity29			0
@entity15 is one of three drugs in the class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors , which block the production of estrogen in postmenopausal women			0
two other estrogen - blocking drugs exist , but few women use them to prevent breast cancer because there are rare but serious possible side effects , such as an increased risk of uterine cancer and blood clots			1
previous studies showed that cancer drug tamoxifen reduced the risk of getting breast cancer in older women by 50 % and osteoporosis drug raloxifene reduced the risk by 38 % after five years of taking the drugs			1
exemestane , better known under the brand name @entity15			0
was found to have fewer side effects than tamoxifen , according to @entity18			1
his study enrolled 4,560 healthy postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer in a placebo - controlled , double - blinded clinical trial			1
the 65 % risk reduction was found after women had been taking the drugs for only three years			2
" this is the first study to show that a new class of drugs , aromatase inhibitors , have the ability to prevent breast cancer in high - risk women , " said dr. @entity67 , who is a breast cancer specialist at the @entity69 in @entity70 and is not connected to this research			1
@entity67 says she prescribes tamoxifen a lot in her practice and believes it 's a very good and very affordable drug			0
but when she tells women about the possible side effects like uterine cancer , " it definitely scares women away , even though the incidence of these side effects is really rare			2
" she hopes more women in the high - risk category will now be open to taking a cancer - preventing drug like @entity15			1
dr. @entity92 is the associate director of @entity20 's @entity69 , but did not participate in the research			0
he says the study is very good but cautions that the side effects of @entity15 should not be ignored			1
" aromatase inhibitors do have side effects and they are significant , " @entity92 said			0
women can have hot flashes , get arthritis and suffer bone loss from taking the drugs , which can have a big impact on a woman 's quality of life , especially for someone who does n't actually have cancer , he said			0
he also pointed out that 94 women were treated with this drug and did not benefit before one woman was prevented from getting breast cancer			2
so when it comes to prescribing @entity15 , " i would limit it to patients who have very high risks " for getting breast cancer , @entity92 said			2
according to the study , women taking @entity15 had no serious toxic effects and only " minimal changes in health - related quality of life			2
" women are considered to be at high risk for breast cancer if they are older than 60 , postmenopausal and / or have had abnormal breast biopsies in which there are some lesions			1
all the experts agree that women need to talk to their doctor to fully understand the risks and benefits of taking these drugs to prevent getting breast cancer			2
@entity134 , the maker of @entity15 , announced in may that the @entity136 patent for this drug had expired , making it eligible for generic drug manufacturers to produce and sell it			0
@entity18 expects the price of this drug to decline quickly because of this			0
however , he says @entity134 would not reveal to him if they plan to ask for an extension of their patent based on this research			0
a spokesperson for the company , which funded some of this research , would not comment on this topic either .			0

women at high risk for breast cancer could take drug before they get it
