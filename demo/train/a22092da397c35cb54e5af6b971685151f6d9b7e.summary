@entity2 on friday night , the @entity1 - registered @entity0 was towed into the port of @entity5 in southern @entity6			2
normally a livestock carrier , the vessel had just under 400 people on board , including more than 70 children			2
most were from @entity12 , desperate to reach @entity13 -- whatever the cost and risk			2
for the second time in days a merchant ship had been abandoned by its crew in atrocious weather in the @entity21 between @entity22 and @entity6 , its human cargo left helpless in storm force gales			2
the message from the @entity0 was simple and helpless : " there is no one to steer			2
" the @entity28 - flagged @entity27 was abandoned by most of its crew three days earlier			2
one of the migrants on board had been able to raise the alarm , but initially a @entity22 frigate in the area reported nothing amiss on board			1
some 800 people were crammed into the hull of @entity38 in both cases , it was the @entity6 coast guard that eventually boarded and steered the ships to safety			2
@entity44 , an anthropologist from the @entity6 port of @entity46 ( where the @entity27 docked ) , says it 's not the first time that larger cargo ships have been involved in illicit journeys at this time of year , with the smugglers hoping there will be fewer maritime patrols over the @entity55 period			2
but the tactic of setting vessels on autopilot and then abandoning them is rare			1
@entity44 , an assistant professor at the @entity59 in the @entity60 , says these larger vessels are often " mother ships " that discharge the migrants onto smaller boats			1
but the heavy sea conditions suggest the @entity0 and @entity27 -- both old ships -- were sacrificed for one last payday			0
people desperate to escape war , persecution ships carrying the migrants are frequently barely seaworthy -- flying under flags of convenience , sometimes with forged certificates			1
they are the workhorses of the @entity77 , changing names and owners frequently , carrying cargoes like salt until sent on one last desperate voyage			1
some have lost their safety certificate			0
the 73 - meter ( 240 - foot ) @entity0 was built in 1966 , according to shipping records			0
these ships carry some desperate to escape war or persecution , who would typically be classified as refugees			0
the majority are trying to escape poverty or hunger -- illegal migrants			1
the distinction is often not easy to make			0
but with the conflict in @entity12 in its fourth year , and the collapse of @entity98 , the flow of desperate people heading north is growing exponentially			1
@entity13 officials say the port of @entity103 in southern @entity104 , which is still connected by ferry to @entity106 in @entity12 , is often a starting point for the journey , and the ships will sometimes travel via @entity110			1
the @entity27 appears to have called at the @entity12 port of @entity106 last month ; the @entity0 at nearby @entity112 in october			0
there is always money to be made out of misery			0
their routes can be difficult to trace ; these vessels often sail with their @entity120 disabled , making them electronically invisible			1
@entity44 says officials at smaller ports in @entity104 , @entity123 and @entity124 sometimes turn a blind eye to the human trafficking , which can be disguised by bringing migrants on board in small batches			1
in @entity98 , the absence of any state authority allows @entity133 fishing boats to take part in the illicit traffic			0
local militia in @entity98 control and profit from two migrant routes through the @entity140			0
in the east , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 come through @entity145 ; west @entity146 pass through @entity147			0
the " passengers " -- frequently without water , food or warmth -- pay anywhere between $ 5,000 and $ 9,000 a person for the crossing			0
so a single shipment might be worth $ 1 million			0
but most are prepared to pay the premium rather than risk trying to take the cheaper route from @entity98 , where @entity146 migrants endure far worse conditions			1
figures from the @entity162 's border agency , @entity161 , show that 270,000 people tried to enter @entity13 illegally in 2014 -- with huge increases in the numbers setting off across the central and eastern @entity77			1
according to the @entity167 , more than 3,000 died in the attempt in 2014			0
pope : do n't let sea " become a vast cemetery " for 15 months cash - strapped @entity6 ran a program called @entity173 , which rescued thousands of would - be refugees and migrants in the @entity77			1
the @entity6 navy converted the @entity177 into a rescue ship equipped with an infirmary , jail cells for smugglers and even quarantine sections for those with infectious diseases			0
but @entity173 cost some $ 12 million a month and critics said it encouraged migrants to try to reach @entity13			1
" traffickers have taken advantage of the situation by placing more vulnerable people in unseaworthy boats on the basis that they will be rescued and taken to @entity6 , " the @entity188 immigration minister @entity187 told @entity189 last year			0
@entity188 refused to contribute to @entity161 's @entity196 , which replaced @entity173 in november and has already rescued some 11,400 migrants			1
even a patrol boat from @entity199 has been involved : the @entity200 was the first alongside the @entity0 late thursday			0
the @entity200 also helped bring more than 400 migrants to a port in @entity204 last month after rescuing them from ships that had set sail from @entity104			1
by its own admission the @entity161 operation is limited , with patrols staying largely within 30 nautical miles of the @entity13 shore			0
its budget is less than one - third of @entity173 , and it has just two planes and a helicopter , and about seven patrol vessels			1
human rights groups say the new approach amounts to " let them drown			0
" the " autopilot " tactic seen in the last week may be a reaction by smugglers to this new policy , as there is less chance of migrants being found farther out to sea			2
the incoming head of the @entity229 , @entity230 , has promised to reinforce @entity161			0
but across the @entity162 , support is rising for stronger action against would - be migrants			2
there is little sympathy for an expensive @entity13 - wide version of @entity173 to pluck thousands of people from the @entity77			1
in november , @entity238 made an impassioned plea for @entity13 to recognize the " human dignity of immigrants			0
" " we can not allow the @entity77 to become a vast cemetery , " he told the @entity189			1
but with several countries on the southern shore of the @entity77 highly unstable , smugglers will be hoping to make much more money in 2015			1
and hundreds of their customers are likely to perish in the process .			0

the flow of migrants has increased *significantly*
many travel on barely seaworthy vessels
