@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 state television has aired a video of @entity6 's son @entity5 in which he apologized to the nation from prison			1
" i apologize to the people of @entity1 and the brothers in the @entity1 state for the disturbance and destabilization i have caused in @entity1 , and i admit those were wrong things that i should not have done , " he said			2
@entity5 , one of @entity16 's seven sons , has been in a @entity0 jail since his extradition earlier this month from neighboring @entity19			1
the @entity21 country had been seeking the handover of @entity5 , who fled across the border to @entity19 when rebel forces toppled his father in a @entity27 - backed uprising in 2011			0
he has not appeared in court yet and no formal charges against him have been announced , but the government has said it has evidence linking @entity32 to recent unrest in southern @entity1			1
" i call on all the people carrying weapons to disarm , weapons should only be in the hands of the state , " @entity32 , dressed in a blue detainee suit , said in the video			2
" they should resort to reconciliation			0
" in the three - minute video clip , he also asks the @entity1 government and general national congress , @entity1 's legislative body , for " forgiveness			1
" the conditions surrounding the release of the video are unclear			1
reports of abuse @entity32 stated the date of march 27 in the video , and state television said it was approved by @entity1 's general prosecutor and aimed to discredit reports and rumors @entity6 's son was being mistreated in prison			1
the video aired a day after former prime minister @entity63 had said in an interview in @entity66 newspaper that he had heard @entity32 was abused and tortured in prison			1
@entity32 said he was being treated well			2
reports he had broken ribs or bones were not true , he said , moving his arms around and smiling			0
no one has independently had access to him to see how he has been treated			0
there have been concerns about the legality of the video and what impact it may have on the case			0
" if i ever had any hope that there might be some form of due process in @entity1 , it was shattered			2
... watching @entity5 repent in a videotaped confession without any hint of legal representation made me realize there is no hope for a trial in accordance with international law in @entity1 , " @entity87 , an @entity88 former aide to @entity32 , told @entity2			1
" i , along with his family , would like to emphasize that we believe this confession to be coerced and therefore nonadmissible in a court of law			0
" but many @entity1 have little sympathy for him and other former regime members in custody			2
they complain the prosecution of former regime members has stalled and they want them to see them sentenced soon			0
the government has promised fair and transparent trials for all former regime members and other detainees in @entity1			2
televised call @entity32 was a professional soccer player and businessman before his father 's downfall			2
unlike his brother @entity120 , their father 's heir apparent , he is not wanted by the @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 , on charges of war crimes			0
in late 2011 , rebel forces captured @entity120 , who remains in a militia hands in the small western mountain town of @entity129 , @entity1			2
@entity19 handed over @entity32 after @entity1 authorities said they had provided evidence of " communications and practices targeting @entity1 's security and aimed at destabilizing @entity1			1
" in february 2012 , he made a televised phone call warning of an imminent uprising in @entity1 , saying he was in regular contact with people in the country who were unhappy with the new authorities			0
authorities in @entity19 had warned him after that incident			0
he had been staying under tight regulation , including house arrest			0
he is being held in @entity145 in @entity0 , the same facility where other senior regime members are detained , including former prime minister @entity147 and former spy chief and @entity6 's brother - in - law @entity149			1
judicial standards @entity1 's new rulers are keen to try @entity6 loyalists at home to show that those who helped the dictator stay in power for 42 years are being punished			1
but in a country where thousands of war prisoners remain in detention without knowing their fate , and where allegations of torture by the militias guarding them have surfaced , @entity1 authorities will have to prove their capabilities			0
human rights activists say the worry that a weak @entity0 government and flimsy judicial standards mean that legal proceedings will not meet international standards			1
last month , @entity170 released a report after visiting and speaking with senior regime members , including @entity149 and @entity120			0
according to the rights group , officials said they either do not have lawyers representing them or they do not have enough access to their legal counsel			0
" the @entity1 government should make greater efforts to ensure these detained former officials have adequate legal counsel and the opportunity to defend themselves fairly before a judge , " said @entity178 , deputy director of @entity170 's @entity180 and @entity21 division			1
" the prosecution of these men will be no more credible than a kangaroo court if the authorities fail to provide these men with basic due process rights			0
" in a briefing to the @entity197 earlier this month , @entity193 , special representative of the @entity195 secretary - general , raised concerns about continued human rights violations in detention			1
some trials of former regime members started more than a year ago , and another case against more than 30 officials , including @entity120 and @entity149 , is set to start next month			0
