-- three sex abuse lawsuits against the man who once voiced " @entity5 's " @entity4 character have been dismissed by a federal appeals court			1
the 2nd @entity7 made its ruling april 2 in the case of puppeteer @entity10 , who resigned from his job after allegations first surfaced in november 2012			1
the ruling agrees with a lower court 's decision that the accusers waited too long to file their suits			1
the appellate court 's decision on the three @entity21 lawsuits does not cover a separate lawsuit , filed in @entity23 last year , by @entity25 's first public accuser			1
no resolution of the @entity23 case has been announced			2
@entity0 's attempt to contact @entity10 's attorney for comment thursday was n't immediately successful			1
a district judge had dismissed the @entity21 suits last july , ruling that the statute of limitations -- which requires a filing within six years of the alleged crime or three years after the plaintiffs turned 18 -- had run out			1
the plaintiffs -- all adult men who said they were courted and seduced by @entity25 when they were underage teenagers -- appealed , arguing the six - year rule should have applied from 2012			1
that , they contended , was the year they realized they 'd been harmed			2
the appellate court ruled that the lower court properly dismissed the suits " given that the plaintiffs ' complaints failed to provide any reason why the plaintiffs were unable to discover their injuries prior to 2012			1
" clash provided the high - pitched voice of the iconic furry red @entity4 from 1984 until 2012 , when @entity50 became the first to publicly claim that he had a sexual relationship with @entity25 as a teen			2
@entity50 called it an " adult consensual relationship " in november 2012 , but filed the @entity23 lawsuit in march 2013 alleging @entity25 threw a crystal meth sex party for him in 2004 , when he was 16			2
@entity50 ' attorney was not immediately available for comment thursday			0
@entity25 acknowledged a relationship between " two consenting adults " when @entity50 ' story initially emerged , but he said it otherwise was a " false and defamatory allegation			0
" " i am a gay man , " @entity25 , 53 , said in a statement in november 2012			0
" i have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter			0
" that month , @entity25 issued a written statement saying : " i am resigning from @entity68 with a very heavy heart			0
i have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization			0
personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work @entity5 is doing and i can not allow it to go on any longer			0
i am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately			0
" @entity68 is the nonprofit educational organization behind " @entity5			0
