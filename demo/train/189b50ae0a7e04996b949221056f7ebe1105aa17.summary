jobs expert @entity0 , host of @entity2 's new series " @entity4 ta do it , " took a chance wednesday			1
for a little more than an hour , @entity0 allowed himself to be asked anything , by anyone			1
@entity0 sat down for a @entity9 online chat , where he dished about : -- the job that disgusted him the most -- what it 's like working for @entity2 -- how his fear of the mob affected his decision to showcase a certain job after more than 2,900 comments , here 's the good stuff			1
some of it has been edited for length			2
( for the full transcript , follow the permalinks			2
forbidden jobs : q : " what dirty jobs did you always want to do but the network or producers would n't let you do ? ( too dangerous , inappropriate , so on ) , " asked @entity32			0
@entity0 : " the segments i was most interested in doing but found the most resistance around was that of a rendering facility			1
... the mob is still involved in a surprising number of rendering facilities			2
why the mob has such a rich history in garbage - related industries and rendering - related industries is a conversation beyond my pay grade			2
i only know how relieved i was to finally find a rendering outfit that was not owned or operated by the @entity46			0
" that facility was in @entity48			0
and they were called @entity50			0
" to this day , i 'm impressed with how brave they were in their decision to let us provide our viewers with an unvarnished look at what it takes to turn a dead cow into several hundred pounds of chicken feed			0
shockingly awful jobs : @entity62 : " what job shocked you the most by finding out how awful it really was ? " asked nomadbishop			2
@entity67 , buoy tenders are responsible for hoisting these giant steel contraptions out of the ocean , and refurbishing them			0
" in this case , " refurbishment " means crawling into a woefully inadequate tube not much larger than the space taken up by your shoulders , and wiggling your way like a worm into the shadowy depths whereupon you begin to remove the barnacles and various other forms of nautical life with a stick or some other improvised tool			0
" @entity60 later , @entity85 posted that he or she used to do that job , saying , " @entity90 guy here			2
once you start scraping that s * * t off and things start crawling around you and dripping down your neck you have got to question the honesty of your recruiter			0
his @entity2 job : @entity62 : " how has the transition to @entity2 been ? also , what was the reason for the move ? " asked @entity100			1
@entity0 : " the truth is , it 's become very difficult to produce a show with no second takes , and no script , because the people in charge of putting them on the air would prefer to control them , in the same way an executive might be able to control an episode of ' @entity115			1
' " it occurred to me that networks like @entity118 and @entity2 were not just news outlets , but fundamentally , nonfiction outlets			1
" @entity2 , in particular , was very interested in exploring alternative forms of programming , very similar to ' @entity123			1
' " in short , they 've been great to work with			1
" and as long as headlines like @entity127 , and @entity128 , and terrorism , and natural disasters do n't completely dominate the landscape , i think there will be room for ' @entity134 ' and other shows like it			1
making friends on the job : q : " do you keep in touch with any of the people you met at any of your dirty jobs ? " asked @entity138			1
@entity0 : " too many to mention			1
" although i will mention one			0
there is a farm , in @entity146 , called @entity147			0
@entity0 and @entity148 run one of the largest dairies in the @entity151			1
we first shot there back in 2006 , and @entity0 trusted me to not only deliver a dozen cows on a cold winter 's evening , he allowed me to perform a cesarean			2
" after that , he invited the crew and i to stay with them for the evening , and several days afterward			0
" to this day , none of us are allowed to fly over @entity146 without first landing in @entity162 , and driving to @entity147 to drink their wine , and their delicious milk			0
but mostly , their wine			0
' worst advice i 've ever heard ' : @entity62 : " if you went to a guidance counselor in high school , what would he / she have said your ideal job would be ? " asked cjmarc			1
@entity0 : " i did go to a guidance counselor in high school , his name was mr. @entity182 , and he gave me the worst advice i 've ever heard			1
" he told me that my desire to attend a two - year community college was ' beneath my potential			0
' " as it turns out , the two - year school i ultimately attended allowed me to experiment , and explore all kinds of studies that i simply would not have been able to afford at the university			2
" consequently , i got on the road that brought me to where i 'm sitting now			0
" although , to be fair , i should point out that the road also led through several miles of sewer pipes			0
