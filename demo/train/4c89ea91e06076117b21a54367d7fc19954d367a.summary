-- when @entity2 was 16 , she went out with a friend who had too much to drink and could n't drive home			1
if her friend 's car had been an automatic , there would n't have been a problem -- but it had a manual transmission			1
luckily , @entity2 had driven a tractor before , giving her some familiarity with stick - shift driving			1
she wrestled the car into second gear and managed to drive them home			0
now a mother of three girls , @entity2 and her husband have already taught two of their daughters to " drive stick			1
" " you never know when you 're going to need the skill , " she said			0
the ability to drive a car with a manual transmission has long been considered an essential skill , especially for young drivers			1
yet decades after @entity2 's impromptu introduction to stick shifts , changes in the makeup of the automobile and @entity35 consumer habits mean mastering the manual may no longer be a practical necessity			1
downshifting : thinning of manual herd in the earliest days of the automobile industry , cars came with only one type of transmission : the manual			2
after @entity44 released the first automatic transmission -- the 1940 @entity45 -- automobile manufacturers swiftly moved away from manuals			0
by 1957 , 82.7 % of @entity35 - made cars were equipped with automatic transmissions , according to " @entity50			1
" though manuals have accounted for about 4 % of @entity35 car sales in recent years , experts were surprised to see the percentage jump almost 3 % in the first quarter of 2012 , according to a report by @entity57			1
the percentages may seem small , but with nearly 12.8 million cars sold in the @entity35 last year , those sales add up to more than a half million manuals			1
some manufacturers have inferred that the 6.98 % " take rate , " or percentage of total cars bought , signifies a manual comeback in the consumer market			1
despite earlier worry about appealing to millennials , @entity68 , @entity70 's small car marketing manager , said @entity44 believes there 's a future for manuals in the @entity35 consumer market			1
the company has gone so far as to create mechanisms meant to make manuals more appealing to drive , like the rollback - ready @entity81 feature			1
upshifting : comeback or blip ? @entity84 , a product communications representative for @entity86 , said that while he 's not so sure manuals are making a comeback with average consumers , he believes some people will always want them			1
" most people are just interested in getting from a to @entity93 , " @entity84 said			0
people who purchase manuals , @entity84 said , either love the act of driving or are enticed by manuals ' historically lower price tag			2
( some small cars like the @entity100 , however , are more expensive as manuals			1
) " manual transmissions are considered common novelty			2
in the rest of the world , it just is n't so , " @entity84 said			0
if automatics become cheaper in other countries , this may change , he said			0
despite the uptick in manual take rates , not everyone is convinced manuals are making a comeback			1
" the @entity35 market has been moving away from manuals over the past couple of decades , " said @entity115 , @entity117 's technology and motorsports communications manager			1
" we do not see a change in that trend in the foreseeable future			0
" @entity117 , which only offered manual transmissions in 10 of its 19 models in 2011 , had an overall manual take rate of 2.1 % last year			0
just over half of manual sales came from two cars -- the @entity132 and the @entity134 pickup truck			1
" it might look like there 's a stick - shift revival under way in 2012 , but we 're not so sure , " @entity136 editor @entity135 said			2
" fewer manual transmission cars on the road will mean , eventually , that there will be fewer parents or friends who know how to drive them , and so fewer teachers for the next generation			1
" pumping the brakes on hype manuals , when driven correctly , have traditionally been more fuel efficient than other transmission types , but new transmissions and improvements to automatics have rendered this moot in some models			1
the automatic @entity158 gets slightly better gas mileage than its manual counterpart ; moreover , new options like continuously variable , dual - clutch and semi-automatic transmissions with paddle shifters , while expensive , can make up for their price tag with fuel efficiency			1
" almost all the high - mpg cars you see advertised on tv , whether they 're hybrids or a @entity172 , get their best mileage with one of these other types of transmissions , " @entity168 managing editor @entity167 said			0
it 's important to remember that gas prices , while high , have been high for the past few years -- and manual take rates have n't skyrocketed in that period of time			2
where are manuals ' advantages ? for some consumers with children , technological advancements in other transmissions are outshined by perceived experiential benefits of the manual			2
@entity190 , an account manager in @entity191 , is wary of teaching new drivers in automatic cars			0
" we made both of our children learn to drive on a stick , " @entity190 said			2
" and it 's still the only thing they drive			0
" @entity190 said the prevalence of manuals overseas was a major factor in her decision			0
" it takes time and practice , but it 's worth it , " said @entity204 , @entity190 's daughter			0
" once it clicks you do n't even think about it			0
" many parents also falsely believe that having their children drive manuals will keep them safer because it 's more difficult to text or talk on the phone while driving			1
but neither is impossible , and you ca n't control other drivers on the road			0
multiple federal and state transportation agencies stated accident logs do not differentiate between transmission types			0
lessons from the brains of driving instructors while there remain parents who want their kids to drive stick , most driving schools consider such requests anomalous , @entity135 of @entity57 said			1
" chances are at some point they are going to be exposed to a car with a standard manual transmission , " added @entity234 of @entity235 , a driving school based in @entity237			2
" depending on where the teen lives and the types of cars they are allotted to drive , it is relevant and necessary for some and not others			2
our teens tell us unless there is a direct need , they can learn later in life			0
" @entity256 said no more than 15 % of his school 's students come from families owning manuals and that fewer students actually drive them			2
overall , the school gets only about two or three manual training requests a month			0
" i think the old school thought is , ' i learned on a stick back in the day , so my kid should , ' " @entity256 said , " but that does n't mean it 's right			2
those that are into cars are much more likely to want to learn			0
" his school starts all of its students in cars with automatic transmissions if they do not request otherwise , and does not keep a manual car in its fleet , he said			2
@entity281 , president of @entity282 in @entity283 , @entity284 , recently purchased a six - speed manual @entity286 for his fleet after finding out some students wanted to learn to drive it			0
" i do n't know how many of ( the students ) just want to drive a @entity286 and how many of them actually want to learn to drive manual as a life skill , though , " @entity281 said			1
@entity295 's manual student population has held steady at 15 % for the last five years , and parents usually are the ones who ask for their children to learn manual rather than the children themselves , @entity281 said			0
still , @entity256 and @entity281 concur with those who think learning manuals can make a student a better driver than those who simply drive automatics			1
@entity281 added that the desire has to be there			0
" it 's wonderful for them to learn it , " @entity281 said , " but you have to want that			0
you have to want to play golf to go take a golf lesson			0
" he 's not so sure that matters to all parents , as some seem disinclined to make their children the independent drivers they should be			0
" i 've got parents asking me why we teach their kids to parallel park when the car does it for you , " he said			0
do you teach your kids how to drive a stick shift or do you think it 's unnecessary ? let us know in the comments below .			1

@entity332 considered an essential skill in @entity35 , driving stick might be endangered
2012 uptick in sales led some to say manuals making a comeback ; experts are n't sure
manuals are n't always less expensive , more efficient , or safer to drive than automatics
driving a manual may make you a better driver , or at least teach you something about cars
