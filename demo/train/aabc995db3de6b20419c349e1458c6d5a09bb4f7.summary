as millions of @entity1 headed for the polling stations across the nation last weekend , there was a general sense that change was at hand			1
as the results of the vote started trickling in during the evening , it soon became clear that the political scene in @entity1 was about to become a much different place			2
when it was all over and done , the ruling @entity13 ( @entity13 ) had merely won six of the 22 constituencies in the mayoral and commissioner elections , while the opposition @entity20 ( @entity20 ) won 13 , and did so with sizable leads			2
moreover , the @entity13 had lost control of @entity23 , the capital city it had run for 16 consecutive years , to an independent with no political experience , and also saw safe cities in the northern half of the island , such as @entity29 and @entity30 , slip through its fingers			1
in all , it lost nine of the 15 cities and counties it used to control			2
overall , the @entity20 garnered 5.83 million votes , or 47.6 % , against the @entity13 's 4.99 million ( 40.7 % )			0
however , if we factor the votes that went to independent candidates who are ideologically close to the @entity20 , the " green camp " accounted for a solid 6.88 million votes			0
discontent with the @entity13 alone does n't sufficiently explain the @entity20 's performance ; the latter , including leader @entity44 , worked tirelessly in the lead - up to the elections , and for the most part fielded candidates of quality			0
in the wake of catastrophe , premier @entity52 and @entity13 secretary - general @entity53 , as well as 80 members of the @entity55 , have resigned , and it is now rumored that president @entity57 , who doubles as @entity13 chairman , could step down from the latter position on wednesday			0
lazy campaigns ? there are sundry reasons for the defeat			1
in many constituencies , including @entity23 , the @entity13 ran lazy campaigns and spent more time attacking its opponents than trying to convince voters of the virtues of its own candidates			1
more importantly , @entity57 and his party have become highly unpopular			0
after six years of rapprochement with @entity72 , and the signing of as many as 20 cross-strait agreements , the promised " revival " of @entity1 's stagnating economy never materialized			1
furthermore , the benefits of increasing trade with @entity79 tended to fall in the lap of magnates who were close to the administration , while for the majority of @entity1 -- especially youth -- the prospects for their future seemed grim			1
many voters appear to have blamed the @entity13 's inability to deliver domestically on the administration 's single - minded focus on @entity79			2
undeniably , relations between the two sides have improved since 2008 , when @entity57 stepped into office , but many have become increasingly aware of the inherent political risks of doing so			0
@entity1 of all stripes know that @entity72 continues to regard @entity1 as a " renegade province , " but many were nevertheless willing to liberalize ties with it , though many faulted @entity57 for not paying enough attention to safeguarding the island 's sovereignty and democracy in the process			1
more and more , local problems were seen to be tied to the external @entity79 factor			1
from the media to major infrastructure projects , " black box " trade agreements to @entity114 gangsters menacing the population , @entity79 's hand suddenly became a major issue			1
a red line had been crossed , and civic organizations fearing the administration had gone too far , took action			0
in march , scores of protesters stormed a key government building to urge the government to scrap a controversial trade deal with @entity79 in what was dubbed the @entity128			1
the @entity57 administration reacted to all this with repression , then indifference , and consequently paid a high price on november 29			0
one of the @entity134 ' greatest achievements was to raise awareness about the perceived failures of government and the " black hand " of @entity79			2
@entity128 generation candidates like @entity141 in @entity23 had great appeal with the @entity128 generation			1
the fact that the @entity20 chose not to field a candidate to run against him was a masterful move on chairperson @entity44 's part : it signaled the party 's willingness to cooperate with this " third force			0
" several young candidates , some of them from smaller parties or running as independents , were also elected and will be part of that coalition			0
this green coalition will undoubtedly be more attuned to civil society , and their control of a majority of the municipalities across @entity1 will make it more difficult for the central government to implement policies that are unpopular with the public -- something it has done repeatedly since the beginning of @entity57 's second , and last , term in 2012			1
in an early sign that things may be already changing , mayor - elect @entity141 has already said he would fire the police chief in @entity173 if @entity114 activists continued to physically assault practitioners @entity175 -- a spiritual movement banned in @entity79 â€” and pro-taiwan independence activists outside the @entity23 skyscraper			1
facing much greater resistance from " below , " and confronted to an emboldened pan-green coalition , @entity57 's ability to press ahead with further unpopular agreements with @entity79 likely has been severely compromised			2
with a little more than a year left in office , he may have reached the limit of what he can give to @entity72 , even more so if he steps down as party chairman			0
there is no doubt that civil society , and the many that it inspired , punished the @entity13 in the elections			0
unless the @entity13 wants to go through a similar embarrassment in the 2016 presidential election , whoever is in charge will have to ensure that the party better reflects public wishes			0
and that means being more careful with @entity79 .			0

@entity1 's ruling party routed in local elections in " black *saturday* . "
they lost control of @entity23 for first time in 16 years
lazy campaigns and the " @entity79 factor " caused their defeat , says @entity211
" @entity128 generation " wary of closer ties with @entity79
