-- the spectacle of @entity2 swallowing pieces of a neighboring country while claiming to defend its people would make @entity6 grimace with recognition			1
this weekend 's charade , a " referendum " in which we 're told more than 96 % voted to join @entity2 , fits perfectly with the orwellian narrative			1
in this twilight zone of make - believe , @entity2 troops invade after removing the insignias from their uniforms and @entity17 explains , " you can go to a store and buy a uniform , " claiming they are local " self - defense forces			1
" maybe @entity23 shops also sell machine guns and armored personnel carriers			0
in this world of double - speak and misinformation , @entity26 is manipulating the message , intimidating , twisting facts and lying -- the more absurd the propaganda the better			1
my personal favorite is the branding of @entity23 's independence push as the " @entity37			2
" the most famous independence " spring " was the 1968 " @entity39 , " a push to expand freedoms in @entity42 that was crushed by @entity44 tanks			0
on second thought , maybe @entity45 should embrace irony and call this charade a @entity2 @entity37			1
do not believe those who say the result is fair or an accurate reflection of the popular will			1
sure , the @entity2 speakers in @entity23 are intoxicated with @entity2 nationalism right now			1
so are millions in the motherland , who have heard the persistent false claims about grave threats , even warning of genocide against @entity2 's " brothers " in @entity23 and elsewhere in @entity45			1
the more you hear about threats to ethnic @entity2 , the closer @entity17 is getting to launching an expanded invasion			1
look for claims of " requests for protection " from @entity26			0
after all , how can @entity26 not help			0
and ignore the @entity2 agents sowing unrest			1
the unrest is the required pretext			0
@entity2 will come and " pacify			2
" this tactic was not invented by @entity17 ; it left a fetid track in the history of @entity74 empire - building , ethnic cleansing and warfare			1
before the propaganda campaign , a poll reported in the @entity78 found a majority of @entity81 were not exactly yearning to join @entity2			1
more than half said their homeland was @entity23 , and 35 % said @entity45			2
about 12 % of @entity81 are @entity85 who despise @entity2			1
about one - quarter are ethnic @entity45			2
you can bet they feel absolutely no affection for @entity2 today			2
the referendum process was a travesty			0
thousands of invading soldiers , no campaigning to hear differing views , no choice on the ballot for the status quo , intimidation of opponents , and a lightning - fast schedule after the local government is overthrown under the watch of armed men in unmarked camouflage fatigues			0
democracy ? you tell me			0
the referendum was not just a violation of democratic norms and @entity45 law , it was a clear violation of international law			0
a @entity115 statement said @entity17 told @entity117 president @entity116 that @entity23 independence echoes the " @entity120 experience			1
" he may come to regret bringing up the former @entity121 , which unraveled in an orgy of ethnic and nationalism - driven bloodshed in the 1990s			0
no country annexed @entity120 , and that experience has little in common with @entity23			0
no one has accused the new @entity45 government of persecuting @entity23 's @entity2 the way @entity130 forces ever did			1
the new @entity45 government does contain an element of extreme right - wingers , who should be isolated and removed			0
the large mainstream of @entity45 's government , including its prime minister , is moderate , liberal , democratic and peaceful			0
@entity26 's false narrative that fascists control @entity140 is a ploy , a pretext			0
already @entity17 has reserved the right to " defend " @entity2 in other parts of @entity45			1
so - called self - defense forces captured a gas terminal close to @entity23 , just inside @entity45			0
what comes next -- and what should the @entity148 do ? there are clear signs that @entity17 has designs on eastern @entity45			2
he may not have decided yet			0
and what if he orders an invasion there ? what if he goes for the rest of @entity45 ? after all , @entity2 has close ties to @entity23 , but it also has strong emotional ties to @entity140			1
and then ? many neighboring republics are getting nervous			0
their history books are replete with stories of conquest			0
would @entity26 dare ? we just do n't know			0
@entity166 will not go to war against @entity2 over @entity45			2
the @entity148 should set up a dual track response			0
first , help the new @entity45 succeed			0
@entity45 prosperity , democracy , anti-corruption reform , everything the @entity45 say they want			0
many in @entity2 want it too			2
at the same time , impose sanctions and set up trip wires -- escalating sanctions that will go into effect if @entity2 makes more military moves			2
if @entity26 makes a move to seize more of @entity45 , tell the @entity181 , which yearns to join @entity166 and already lost territory to a similar @entity2 move , that its request will go on an approval track			1
the @entity117 and @entity74 need to work together and speak with one voice			1
@entity116 is traveling to @entity74 in the next few days			2
meetings with @entity166 allies should produce more than statements			0
they should produce more than threats			0
real sanctions will make @entity17 rethink his next move , especially if they affect his oligarch friends , who enjoy homes in @entity196 and ski trips in the @entity198			2
sanctions require full @entity74 participation			2
much has been made of @entity74 's need for @entity2 natural gas			1
but gas sales are a double - edged sword			1
@entity2 needs its @entity74 customers			1
@entity117 's newfound gas riches could help @entity74 gain independence from @entity26			1
the long - term goal is to convince @entity2 that the use of force is counterproductive , that the costs outweigh the benefits			1
@entity45 will always be @entity2 's neighbor			1
one country 's prosperity will benefit the other			0
for now , however , @entity17 views @entity45 's dash for an independent , @entity148 future as a challenge to his worldview ; to his goal of a @entity222 future dominated by @entity26			1
he has shown he is prepared to use force			0
he has also shown that he wants a veneer of legitimacy for his actions			0
that 's why he is taking the trouble of placing orwellian labels and going through faux - democratic moves			2
if @entity17 believes each region should have the right to choose in what country it belongs , he has just smashed a hornet 's nest			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			0

@entity240 : @entity17 's talk of " democracy " is double - speak and *unfounded* lies
@entity245 : the 96 % vote to join @entity2 is far from an accurate reflection of the popular will
@entity245 : @entity17 's warnings about threats to ethic @entity2 hint at an expanded invasion
she says @entity117 , @entity74 must unite to convince @entity17 the costs of invasion are dear
