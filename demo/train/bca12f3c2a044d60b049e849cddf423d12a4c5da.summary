-- when @entity2 , 29 , signed up for @entity5 's at - home genetic testing service , there were no surprises in his results			1
the @entity8 learned he would probably die from " a mix of heart attack and prostate cancer , " he wrote on a friend 's blog , but " nothing special there			2
" then a few months ago , he received an update from the company			0
@entity2 's genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to limb - girdle muscular dystrophy , he says the site told him			1
" some people with limb - girdle muscular dystrophy lose the ability to walk and suffer from serious disability , " his results page read			0
this ca n't be true , he thought			0
it must be an error			0
genetic testing can be a powerful tool			1
it can offer information about your family history , tell you how your body might respond to different drugs and identify your risk factors for disease			0
it can also be misleading			0
the @entity42 on monday ordered @entity5 to stop sales of its $ 99 home genetic testing kits , saying the @entity46 - backed company has not proven the validity of its product			1
the @entity42 warned that customers who received inaccurate results could suffer from undue mental anguish or undergo unnecessary medical procedures			1
the government agency has asked @entity5 to revise its marketing strategy to comply with federal regulations			1
the action triggered outrage among some of @entity5 's supporters			1
" so gmos , aspartame , artificial flavors & colors , pink slime ... no problem ! " a poster named @entity61 wrote on the company 's @entity63 page			2
" but in no way should we be allowed the right to know our own genetic material as a means for making better decisions about our health			2
" in a statement , @entity5 said it has received the @entity42 's letter and will be working to address the agency 's concerns			1
there are more than 3 billion letters in our genetic code			2
though it 's been 10 years since the @entity88 was completed , scientists still do n't understand what every gene does , and what a mutation might mean for someone 's health			2
it 's one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often			1
if dna experts do n't understand 100 % what a gene mutation means , how can we expect consumers to ? 5 cool things dna testing can do scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders , says @entity105 , president of the @entity106			1
these are disorders that can be diagnosed based on the mutation of a single gene in the body ; some examples include @entity113 's disease or cystic fibrosis			2
but conditions such as type 2 diabetes or @entity117 's are more complex			2
hundreds of genes may contribute to the development of these diseases , @entity121 says , and a person 's risk is also influenced by his or her environment			2
testing for markers of risk scattered across someone 's genome is " really only testing for the tip of the iceberg			1
" " that 's where it gets a little scary , because if a person has a normal test result on @entity5 , they leave thinking they do n't have a risk , " she says			1
" it 's not that the science behind ( this kind of genetic testing ) is n't good			1
it 's that the science behind them is n't complete			0
" the upside of these at - home genetic testing kits -- and @entity5 is n't the only company that sells them -- is that they 've generated a lot of buzz about genetics , @entity121 says			1
she says she believes most early adopters of the tests are information - savvy and understand the results are n't set in stone			0
" i do n't think that anyone thinks that this kit replaces formal testing by a doctor , " @entity161 posted on @entity5 's @entity63 page			1
" i seriously doubt that a doctor would agree to perform , say , a double mastectomy , based on these results			0
" @entity170 posted , " if you find something interesting , you then take it to a medical professional for further evaluation			0
no one is or should rely on it for medical ' diagnosis			0
' it 's just a tool , like personally checking your heart rate with a watch or checking your weight on a scale			1
" but @entity121 says she worries about what will happen when the tests become more mainstream			0
giving this kind of information to someone unfamiliar with genetic testing 's limitations could prove dangerous			1
@entity121 recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor			1
counselors have specialized graduate degrees and extensive knowledge of the human genome			0
they 're also trained in explaining test results to laymen			0
" our message is to be a smart consumer , " @entity121 says			0
" know what you 're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit			0
" @entity2 did some intense investigating , saying he looked at the raw data @entity5 provided him			1
he eventually found he did indeed have two mutations , he says , but they were n't on the same gene			0
he says he submitted his " bug report " to the company and it apologized			0
in general , @entity2 thinks it 's a good thing for every person to have affordable access to his or her genetic data			2
but he 's browsed the community forums on @entity5 and has seen how seriously some people take their results -- without fully understanding them			1
@entity2 says he now believes he will not get limb - girdle muscular dystrophy , although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids			0
" i can live with that , " he wrote			0
" for quite some time , i hope			0
" parents push for standardized screening of @entity232 genetic diseases @entity0 's @entity233 and @entity235 's @entity234 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			2

@entity42 has ordered @entity5 to stop sales of its $ 99 home genetic testing kits
@entity5 supporters took to *social* media to *protest* the @entity42 's decision
genetic testing can be a powerful tool if used correctly , experts say
