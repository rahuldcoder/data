-- it 's time for @entity2 to come clean			1
at a dramatic press conference last week , the @entity4 governor tried to apologize and said he had no advance knowledge of the lane closings on the @entity8			0
but he came across mostly upset that his senior staff had lied to him instead of upset that the citizens of @entity11 , @entity4 , suffered during days - long politically motivated gridlock			0
plus , no amount of talking would mute the lingering questions : even if @entity2 had n't ordered the lane closings ( a significant and still - to - be verified if ) , why was n't he at least digging into the truth of the story in october and november , when the press and state legislators certainly were ? saying he just did n't know just does n't seem credible			1
at worst , @entity2 seems like a bully who ordered or inspired his staff to punish political opponents			2
at best , @entity2 seems like a passive leader who does n't have a handle on his top staff			1
either way , @entity2 is taking a hit ; as a new poll shows , @entity2 's approval rating among @entity4 voters has fallen from 65 % to 59 % in one month			1
moreover , the incident has taken a toll on his personal reputation			0
a year ago , 70 % of @entity36 held a favorable personal impression of @entity2			1
today , that number is just 44 %			0
and cementing the sense that @entity2 has n't told the full story , 51 % of @entity36 said they believe @entity2 has n't been completely honest yet about what he knows about the bridge closings			1
adding to @entity2 's woes and image problems is news , first reported by @entity0 , that federal investigators are looking into whether the governor improperly used $ 25 million in @entity51 relief on a tourism marketing campaign that featured @entity2 and his family			1
the ads ran in the lead - up to the 2013 election , in which @entity2 successfully sought a second term			2
at the time , @entity59 skewered the ads , as did some @entity61			0
sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , like @entity2 considered a leading contender for the @entity61 presidential nomination in 2016 , said in november , " that 's a real problem and that 's why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayers ' money wisely , they 're offended to see our money spent on political ads. that 's just offensive			1
" of course , to @entity4 's hurricane victims , many of whom are still living in trailers and 75 % of whom feel forgotten by the recovery , describing @entity2 using aid money as his personal slush fund as " offensive " is an understatement			2
meanwhile , just 15 % of federal aid for @entity51 had actually been spent as of last fall			2
and that 's just what we know now			0
ironically for @entity2 , scandals are like gathering storms that tend to gain momentum and sweep up everything in their path			2
in addition to previously reported stories about @entity2 's bullying political persona , this week more @entity4 mayors came out of the woodwork to allege that the @entity2 administration retaliated against them for not endorsing his re-election			1
according to the @entity105 , after declining to endorse @entity2 , @entity104 mayor @entity103 found he was no longer able to get meetings with state commissioners to address key governance issues			2
@entity103 's name came up in the cache of e-mails recently released on the @entity11 scandal			2
the day of the lane closings , when @entity2 's deputy chief of staff @entity115 e-mailed @entity117 appointee @entity113 to ask if @entity11 mayor @entity119 's complaints had been responded to , @entity113 wrote back , " radio silence			1
his name comes right after mayor @entity103			0
" mayor @entity123 of @entity124 said she has also suspected retribution from the @entity2 administration after she did not endorse the governor for re-election			2
@entity123 said she believes her city received less @entity130 storm preparation funding because of her lack of endorsement			0
meanwhile , more e-mails and documents are coming out about the bridge scandal , implicating other members of @entity2 's senior staff and at least suggesting they knew about the alleged retribution scheme , or perhaps were more involved			1
that makes it even more far - fetched to imagine that @entity2 really only learned the truth a few days ago			0
the media started sniffing around about political motivations for the bridge closures in mid-september			0
by mid-november , the @entity145 was convening hearings			0
by mid-december , @entity113 and @entity148 , @entity2 's top appointees at the @entity117 , had both resigned over the growing scandal			1
why did @entity2 finally ask his staff for the facts around the lane closures a few weeks ago ? was @entity2 stuck in traffic for three months ? did he willfully rip the rear view mirrors off and put on blinders ? @entity158 's @entity157 said that watching @entity2 try to defend himself was reminiscent of @entity160 's denying his affair with @entity161			1
indeed , the analogy is that @entity160 was handicapped from the get - go by the common knowledge that he was a philandering cad , just as many @entity165 and voters across the country find it hard to believe that a governor known for being a political bully had absolutely nothing to do with the bridge scandal			1
@entity2 built his political career with a reputation for directness			0
but increasingly , it seems as though he has something to hide			0
and so the questions will keep mounting until @entity2 comes clean			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity182 says @entity2 needs to go further in commenting on bridge scandal
she says he needs to *explain* why he did n't respond to the *controversy* for weeks
@entity182 : @entity2 also under fire for handling of @entity51 relief funds
she notes that @entity2 's ratings among @entity36 are declining
