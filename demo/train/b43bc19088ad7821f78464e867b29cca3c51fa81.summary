police in @entity4 have arrested 39 members of a suspected @entity7 mafia and freed 30 young @entity7 women whom they allegedly forced into prostitution , a senior officer of the @entity2 regional police told @entity10 wednesday			1
the arrests occurred earlier this week after a long investigation			0
it was the biggest strike to date against @entity7 - run mafias involved in forced prostitution in the northeast region of @entity2 , whose capital is @entity4 , said the senior officer , @entity19 , head of the @entity2 police unit that fights human trafficking			1
in recent years , the @entity7 crime syndicate had crowded out others from the prostitution market in the fashionable @entity26 district of @entity4 by using forced prostitution and charging below - market rates , @entity19 said			1
the women were forced to work in unsanitary conditions and in marathon sessions , seeing eight clients in a row for an hour each , he said			2
after initial arraignments , a judge ordered 33 of the suspects to remain in prison			2
six others were released but remain under investigation , and must check in regularly with authorities , @entity19 said			2
police are searching for six additional suspects , @entity19 said			0
a total of 17 brothels were dismantled			0
the 30 women were initially placed in special assistance centers run by a non-governmental organization , but some have now left to live with friends in @entity4 , he said			0
the suspected @entity7 mafia also was involved in document forgery , said @entity51 , of the @entity2 police organized crime unit , at a news conference wednesday in @entity4			1
" in addition to prostitution , the gang also was involved human trafficking , " @entity55 said			0
" @entity4 was the hub used to later send these people to the @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
so for a time , they were kept against their will in @entity4 or nearby until they were provided with documents in order to travel to these countries			0
" in numerous raids , the police seized forged passports from many countries -- what @entity19 called " perfect and very dangerous false documents " -- as well as the machinery to make them			0
the @entity7 mafia also was involved in drug trafficking , and police seized some weapons in the raids , @entity19 added			1
the @entity2 police broke up a forced - labor scheme involving @entity7 clothing sweatshops in 2009 , freeing several hundred victims and arresting more than 100 suspects			1
but across the nation , police and non-governmental organizations say the biggest problem of modern - day slavery in @entity90 is forced prostitution , involving not just @entity7 women , but also women from @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
last year , @entity90 police broke up a ring that tricked @entity100 men into coming to @entity90 and then forced them to work as male prostitutes .			2

the @entity7 mafia *cornered* the prostitution market with lower rates , officials say
some suspects are still being sought , authorities say
forced prostitution is a large element of modern - day slavery in @entity90
