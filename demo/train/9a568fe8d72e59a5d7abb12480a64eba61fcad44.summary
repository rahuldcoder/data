-- according to a leading senator , it presented " an intolerable risk " to national security			2
according to a consortium of retired generals , it would " break " the @entity8 military			2
and according to a leading advocacy group , over " 528,000 " servicemen and women would be lost			2
something this terrible must be averted			2
we must take action now ! except it is too late			2
the scary danger that these generals , @entity18 , and the @entity19 were warning about was n't a future terrorist attack or war with @entity22 , it was allowing gay and lesbian service men and women to openly serve in the @entity8 military			0
that " grave risk " is now celebrating its one year anniversary , and none of the dire predictions proved correct			1
news : one year later , no overall negative impact on military after repeal of @entity35 " @entity35 " was one of the most controversial issues in @entity8 politics , with tens of thousands of articles and speeches on the topic			1
and yet , once it happened , it played out a lot like @entity44			0
there was a huge amount of hype and hysteria , but the world did not end			1
far from the @entity8 military being broken by allowing gays to serve openly , a recent report by a group of @entity8 military school professors writing for the @entity53 found , " the repeal of @entity35 has had no overall negative impact on military readiness or its component dimensions , including cohesion , recruitment , retention , assaults , harassment or morale			1
" the @entity8 military today has the same level of readiness as it did in 2011			1
it did n't have over half a million servicemen exit in protest , as these opponents claimed would happen			0
in fact , only two service members resigned , neither of them combat troops			0
recruitment is just as high now as then			1
and when the @entity75 recently did an assessment of the risks to @entity8 national security , they found dangers that ranged from loose nukes to terrorism			0
gays and lesbians in uniform did n't make it into the threat matrix			0
politics : the grades are in -- @entity90 's first - term report card those who predicted doom ignored that the military of today is staffed by young , millennial men and women who do not share the anti-gay sentiments of previous generations			1
they ignored empirical research , drawn from over half a century of evidence gathered by independent researchers and the @entity8 military itself			0
they ignored the experiences of allied militaries in places like the @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109 , all of which found that open service would not be destructive			0
they ignored that planning and leadership are the keys to successful policy change , and that the @entity8 military excels at both			1
simply put , their predictions of peril were endemic of the " post-truth " practice so common in politics today : hype and hysteria as a poor substitute for facts and substance			1
that @entity35 's end has been a relative non-story is the best evidence of how the transition to allowing open service has been an unmitigated success by all measures			1
but the experience of the last year is still instructive to keep in mind			1
the journey does not end here			0
only one year in , the policy could easily be overturned or mismanaged into something less successful			2
indeed , there are still some who appear interested in returning to the past and forcing troops back into the closet			0
the 2012 @entity148 platform called for a " review " of such policies , while @entity151 has sent mixed signals on his personal position			1
when running for @entity154 in @entity155 , he supported " gays and lesbians being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation 's military , " but when running for president he argued that the policy should not have been changed to allow it " until conflict was over			2
" it is also useful to keep the experience on " do n't ask , do n't tell " in mind , when the same tactics are used in other debates			0
indeed , many of the very same people are at it once more on topics that range from the role of women in the military to budget cuts			0
these too are again " the most destructive thing in the world " and would " destroy the military			0
" if we are ever going to push past the poisonous political climate of today , we have to start turning to the facts to build our positions , and when we genuinely disagree in our opinions , stop painting the other as hell bent only on total destruction and treason			2
news : army general is military 's first openly gay flag officer perhaps that is the biggest lesson of looking back on the differences between the hype back then of ending dadt and the reality today			1
our political leaders can continue to speak the language of the extreme			0
or , they can just show a little bit of faith in the resilience and maturity of both the @entity8 military and the people they represent			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 and @entity208 .			1

@entity210 , @entity208 : the big " scare " over @entity35 repeal a year *ago* was *unfounded*
writers : new report says readiness , cohesion , morale , recruitment *unaffected* by repeal
they say last year 's *uproar* by some were hype , hysteria in place of facts and substance
writers : @entity231 could affect change . @entity148 platform calls for " review ; " @entity151 *waffles*
