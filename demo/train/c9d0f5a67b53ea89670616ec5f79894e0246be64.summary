@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 launched 100 episodes ago			1
that¹s one hundred weeks of african business news that brought our global audience a fresh perspective from a continent that has not normally been viewed as an investor - friendly destination			1
we kicked off the first show by interviewing @entity12 , who was then the managing director of the @entity13			1
his wife , @entity14 , was with him and he proudly introduced me to her , reminding me that both she and i were both broadcasters			2
she is a famous news interviewer in @entity19			1
then , i interviewed him on the stage at a local university theatre			2
it was a small and intimate setting , so very different from the glare of the global spotlight in which he later found himself			1
my interview with his successor @entity29 more than 90 episodes later was a very different affair			2
we met in a smart @entity34 hotel with a view of @entity36 , the seat of government			2
she was shuttling from @entity1 to the @entity40 to @entity41 and seemed to have a punishing travel schedule but nevertheless looked elegant and not in the least bit fatigued by jetlag or the @entity41 debt crisis			1
she patiently took time to explain why @entity1 should care about what happens in the @entity47			1
looking back , though , it is always gratifying to take the show on the road			1
we reported from @entity51 in @entity52 where we discovered that even the poorest consumers were driving changes in the way multinationals were making and distributing their products			0
we went to @entity58 and its administrative and financial hub , @entity60 , to investigate how the mobile revolution was changing the way poor women had access to healthcare			0
while there , we also talked to @entity58 about schemes to rent land to @entity68 , who were planning to plant rice paddies and export the food back to @entity68			0
this is all part of a continent - wide push to utilize @entity76 land resources smartly			1
see also : interview with @entity79 finance minister importantly , we took the show to @entity79 and reported from the streets of @entity82 and the parched lands in @entity84			2
we explored how remittances , money that is " sent home " from family members in the @entity89 or @entity1 , supports entire communities			1
however , the realities of life in @entity79 were made starkly clear to our crew when police and intelligence officers in @entity82 briefly detained us			0
despite having permission to film , these security forces threatened us and insisted we be taken to a notorious central prison for further questioning			0
they were suspicious and uncomfortable with a foreign tv crew filming openly on the street , even though the @entity79 @entity103 insisted that international media were now welcome in the country			0
we were released only after we made a phone call to a cabinet minister who managed to get the message to them that we were to be left alone			0
we continued filming and presenting @entity110 for the next few days and those two shows give a deep understanding of the political and economic realities in the country			0
the free press in @entity117 was one of my favorite stories on our show			2
we highlighted an innovative scheme of newspaper renting on the street corners of @entity125			0
many @entity117 can not afford to buy newspapers or magazines , so enterprising newspaper " landlords " rent out the daily news for a small fee			2
see also : is the ' blood diamond ' concept changing ? it is always gratifying when an interview is a lively discussion that introduces you to new facts			0
@entity140 advice on how to do business in @entity1 was great fun as she explained some cultural quirks in different @entity146 countries , which might hinder or help when doing business			1
of course , chatting with @entity148 about educating young girls was a treat			0
i wish we could have used the whole half hour of that interview rather than just four minutes			0
as we all know , @entity148 makes for good tv			0
@entity155 is the economist who charted the rise of emerging nations @entity157 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 and then coined the phrase @entity163			0
his insightful analysis was fascinating			0
he expressed confusion as to why @entity1 , a relatively small economic player , had been admitted into this group of global big hitters			1
recently we presented @entity3 from a tugboat in @entity171 harbor			1
we were investigating the challenges facing @entity174 busiest port and what better way to do it than to hitch a ride on a working ship ? as for the next hundred episodes , the journey will continue to be just like doing business in @entity1 : exciting , perhaps slightly risky , but with the promise of excellent results .			1

launched 100 weeks ago , @entity3 brings african business news to the global audience .
the show traveled *extensively* across the continent to deliver news from a fresh perspective .
the show will carry on producing exciting and excellent content about business in @entity1 .
