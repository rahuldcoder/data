@entity0 -- a @entity4 man accused of orchestrating his wife 's murder by hit men while they were on honeymoon in @entity9 should be extradited to face trial , a @entity0 court ruled wednesday			1
@entity12 's appeal was dismissed by judge @entity13 , paving the way for extradition , said an official at @entity17			1
@entity12 is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife , @entity20 , 28 , during a taxi ride in @entity22 in 2010			1
taxi driver @entity23 confessed within weeks of @entity20 's death that he had hired two men to kill her			1
in a plea deal with @entity9 authorities , he said he was paid by @entity12 to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a car hijacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of @entity22			1
@entity23 was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing			0
speaking outside the court wednesday , @entity20 's sister , who did not give her name , said the family was satisfied by the ruling , but it was just one step in the battle to find answers			1
" we do n't want to forget @entity20 in this -- for us it 's all about @entity20 , it 's all about finding out what happened to her , " she said			2
" we will fight this battle to the end , and this battle has just begun for us			0
" the ongoing case has been hard on her family , she said			0
" look at my mum , look at my dad -- they are struggling every day with this			0
they have lost a daughter			0
" @entity62 , the victim 's uncle , told @entity1 the extradition decision is a relief			2
" we want to know what happened			0
our view on this is quite simple			0
there were five people in the car , four men , one lady			0
she was murdered , " he said			0
" three of the people in the car have confessed that that they were involved and they are also in jail now for their part in this incident			0
@entity12 is the only one who has n't spoken			2
we want to know why			0
why did a beautiful girl on her honeymoon have to die , to be killed , brutally murdered ? " @entity12 's legal team may still seek to appeal wednesday 's ruling			2
the businessman , from @entity88 in southwest @entity89 , has said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denies any involvement in the killing			2
his extradition was halted last year on mental health grounds			0
psychiatric experts told a @entity4 court last year that @entity12 was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and that he 'd tried to take his life			1
' fair trial ' @entity9 justice minister @entity102 welcomed wednesday 's extradition ruling , saying it reaffirms the view that @entity9 's legal system is fair and upholds the rule of law			1
" we are also pleased that at last mr. @entity12 will stand trial for the alleged murder that induced a sense of shock and outrage -- national as well as around the world , " he said in a statement			1
" we guarantee him and the entire world that he will indeed receive a fair trial			1
" @entity102 said the ruling is also a vote of confidence in the ability of @entity122 , a psychiatric hospital in @entity22 , and the correctional services to ensure @entity12 is cared for in @entity9			1
but he said the ruling would not mean that @entity12 would immediately be returned to @entity9 , since he has further legal avenues to explore			1
if successful , they could lead to a further appeal in the @entity4 courts			2
@entity12 's attorneys argued last year at the @entity130 in @entity0 that extradition to @entity9 would breach his human rights under @entity134 law			1
their appeal cited concerns over the effect of extradition on his mental illness , the provision of facilities for its treatment and the risk of attack and sexual violence from other inmates			0
@entity1 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
