@entity0 took a @entity2 entertainment reporter to task monday after the reporter appeared to confuse the actor for @entity6			1
" you 're as crazy as the people on @entity9			0
i 'm not @entity6 ! " @entity0 said during a live tv interview			1
" we do n't all look alike			0
we may be all black and famous , but we all do n't look alike			0
" the outburst momentarily stunned @entity17 affiliate @entity16 's @entity15 , who had asked @entity0 what the reaction was to his @entity21 commercial			1
" @entity22 commercial ? " @entity0 replied			1
@entity15 looked off camera , confused			1
he immediately owned up to the mistake , but @entity0 dug in			1
" you 're the entertainment reporter for this station and you do n't know the difference between me and @entity6 ? that must be a very short line for your job outside there , " he said			0
@entity15 apologized repeatedly , at one point slapping himself in the face in jest			2
@entity0 kept the mood light			2
" i 'm the other guy , " he said			0
" there 's more than one black guy doing a commercial			2
i 'm the ' what 's in your wallet ? ' black guy			0
he 's the car black guy			0
@entity46 is the other credit card black guy			0
you only hear his voice , though , so you probably wo n't confuse him with @entity6			0
" @entity15 later issued a more formal apology			2
" i indicated to @entity0 that i 'd seen him during the @entity21 , and he thought that i had confused him with the commercial @entity6 had done for a car company			1
of course a ' @entity55 ' ad had also run during the @entity21 , but i immediately felt so dumb , i did n't bring that up -- and he gave me the shellacking that was well deserved , " the reporter said			1
@entity0 is set to appear in the upcoming sequel " @entity55 : the @entity60			2
" " i pride myself on the fact -- that unlike a lot of people who do this kind of work -- more often than not , i really do know what i 'm talking about			0
but i did n't 30 minutes ago , and i 'm really embarrassed about it , and i very much apologize to @entity0 and anyone else who was offended for what was a very amateur mistake , " @entity15 said .			1
