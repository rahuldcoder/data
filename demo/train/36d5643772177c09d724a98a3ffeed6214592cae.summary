some corporations have religious rights , a deeply divided @entity0 decided monday in ruling that certain for - profit companies can not be required to pay for specific types of contraceptives for their employees			1
the 5 - 4 decision on ideological lines ended the high court 's term with a legal and political setback for a controversial part of president @entity14 's healthcare reform law			1
it also set off a frenzied partisan debate over religious and reproductive rights that will continue through the november congressional elections and beyond			0
all five conservative justices appointed by @entity21 presidents ruled in favor of closely held for - profit businesses -- those with at least 50 % of stock held by five or fewer people , such as family - owned businesses -- in which the owners have clear religious beliefs			1
contraceptives or abortion ? both corporations involved in monday 's rulng -- @entity35 of @entity36 and @entity37 , an @entity38 - based arts - and - crafts retail giant -- emphasize their conscientious desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace			1
they argued the @entity43 , also known as @entity43 , violates the @entity44 and other federal laws protecting religious freedom because it requires them to provide coverage for contraceptives like the " morning - after pill , " which the companies consider tantamount to abortion			1
" the companies in the cases before us are closely held corporations , each owned and controlled by members of a single family , and no one has disputed the sincerity of their religious beliefs , " justice @entity53 wrote in the majority opinion			0
the four liberal justices appointed by @entity66 presidents , including the high court 's three women , opposed the ruling as a possible gateway to further religious - based challenges that limit individual choice and rights			1
what the decision means " into a minefield " in dissent justice @entity77 wrote the court had " ventured into a minefield , " adding it would disadvantage those employees " who do not share their employer 's religious beliefs			0
" the practical result will likely be an administrative fix by the @entity14 administration that subsidizes the contraceptives at issue , said @entity91 political analyst @entity90			0
" so in terms of a real gap in medical coverage for these women , should they want it , i think what you are going to see is the government sort of picking up where @entity37 would leave off , " @entity90 said			1
@entity104 spokesman @entity103 signaled as much , telling reporters the @entity14 administration will work with @entity106 to ensure women affected by the ruling will continue to have coverage for contraceptives			1
@entity14 believes that women " should make personal health care decisions for themselves , rather than their bosses deciding for them , " @entity103 said , adding that " today 's decision jeopardizes the health of women who are employed by these companies			1
" the decision comes two years after the justices narrowly preserved the health care reforms known as @entity43 and its key funding provision in another politically charged ruling			1
this time , the issue revolved around a 1994 federal law known as the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) , which @entity53 's opinion said prevents the government from " taking any action that substantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action constitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest			0
" @entity53 wrote that the court 's conservative majority rejected the argument by the @entity137 that " the owners of the companies forfeited all @entity125 protection when they decided to organize their businesses as corporations rather than sole proprietorships or general partnerships			2
" " the plain terms of @entity125 make it perfectly clear that @entity106 did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for - profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs , " he wrote			1
opinion : it 's @entity21 vs. @entity66 complex mix monday 's case presented a complex mix of legal , regulatory , and constitutional concerns -- over such hot - button issues as faith , abortion , corporate power , executive agency discretion , and congressional intent			0
the political stakes were large , especially for the future effectiveness of the health law itself , which marked its fourth anniversary this spring			2
the botched rollout of @entity171 , the federal @entity43 website , was another political flashpoint along with other issues that many @entity21 say proves the law is unworkable			2
they have made @entity43 a key campaign issue in their fight to take control of the @entity181 while retaining their @entity104 majority			1
" today 's decision is a victory for religious freedom and another defeat for an administration that has repeatedly crossed constitutional lines in pursuit of " big government , said @entity104 speaker @entity183 , an @entity184 @entity21			1
" the president 's health care law remains an unworkable mess and a drag on our economy			0
" rep. @entity199 of @entity200 , who heads the @entity201 , framed the ruling as a campaign issue for november			2
" it is no surprise that @entity21 have sided against women on this issue as they have consistently opposed a woman 's right to make her own health care decisions , " she said , calling the ruling a " dangerous precedent			1
" @entity212 , a founder of @entity37 , called the ruling " a victory , not just for our family business , but for all who seek to live out their faith			1
" however , senate majority leader @entity217 of @entity218 said the decision " jeopardizes women 's access to essential health care , " adding that " your boss should never be able to make your health care decisions for you			1
" read the ruling (			0
@entity225 ) contraception mandate the section of law in dispute requires some for - profit employers to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay			2
a number of companies equate some of the covered drugs , such as the so - called morning - after pill , as causing abortion			0
the specific question presented was whether these companies can refuse , on the sincere claim it would violate their owners ' long - established moral beliefs			0
supporters of the law fear the high court setback on the contraception mandate now will lead to other healthcare challenges on religion grounds , such as do - not - resuscitate orders and vaccine coverage			1
more broadly , many worry giving corporations religious freedom rights could affect laws on employment , safety , and civil rights			0
the abortion link the @entity262 family , owners of @entity264 , and the @entity266 family , owners of @entity37 , said some of the mandated contraception prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman 's womb , which the plaintiffs equate with abortion			2
that includes @entity276 contraception , which some have called the " morning after " pill , and intrauterine devices or @entity280 used by an estimated 2 million @entity282 women			0
monday 's decision comes two years after the justices allowed the law 's " individual mandate " to go into effect			2
that provision requires most americans to get health insurance or pay a financial penalty			0
it is seen as the key funding mechanism to ensure near - universal health coverage			2
under the @entity43 , financial penalties of up to $ 100 per day , per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage			2
@entity37 , which has about 13,000 workers , estimates the penalty could cost it $ 475 million a year			0
the church - state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated between the @entity14 administration and various outside groups			0
under the changes , churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate			0
other nonprofit , religiously affiliated groups , such as church - run hospitals , parochial schools and charities must either offer coverage or have a third - party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer 's direct involvement			0
lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts			0
the cases are @entity326 ( @entity325 ) v. @entity327 ( 13 - 354 ) ; and @entity35 v. @entity326 ( @entity325 ) ( 13 - 356 )			0
a mennonite family 's fight over @entity43 reaches @entity0 5 questions : @entity0 and @entity43 on contraception opinion : how @entity43 can reduce abortions @entity37 : the beliefs behind the battle			1

@entity104 : women , not their bosses , should make personal health decisions
conservative justices rule 5 - 4 in favor of @entity37
the ruling could serve as *template* for future challenges to @entity43
issue was whether businesses can *opt* out of mandate on religious grounds
