-- while the @entity4 in @entity5 steals the world 's attention , over 5,000 miles away another global event born from the same ideal of cultural exchange and peaceful rivalry is entering the home stretch			1
rather than competition , @entity9 in the city of @entity11 , @entity12 , is the latest incarnation of an event that officially is meant to foster international understanding ; unofficially it is used for national promotion , boosting trade and providing networking opportunities			1
of the approximately 4 million visitors that will have wandered through the transformed cement port and industrial site before it closes on august 12 , most will have been there to enjoy the pavilions hosting interactive displays on ocean conservation and marine exploration -- the theme of this year 's event			1
but a small but notable minority will not have been there to watch the shows			2
for them it provides a number of chances to broker deals and reach new contacts where 104 countries can be reached in a day			2
" it 's government relations really , " said @entity39 , director of the @entity41 pavilion			2
" @entity12 is quite important to @entity41			1
it 's an opportunity to brand your country both in a tourism way but also attract skillful people or showcase our abilities			1
" @entity41 's pavilion is funded by a mix of public and private money , including some @entity41 companies at the forefront of the renewable energy industry			0
@entity58 bricks are on hand to attract the visitors and keep them entertained , but a backroom for more grown - up meetings is regularly used			0
" there has to be a reason for them both ( government and private companies ) to be here and spend money on it , " said @entity39			0
" it 's a success if our private partners are happy with their participation and our political relations are very strong			0
" the basic principle of @entity76 is non-commercial and educational , according to the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) , the organizing body that was founded in 1928			0
yet that has not prevented a strong presence from the commercial sector , with a large part of the @entity11 site devoted to temporary pavilions from @entity12 's biggest corporations , some of which were built at a cost of more than $ 1million			1
" @entity76 do n't provide concrete benefits for companies , " says @entity90 , commissioner for @entity9			0
" but is it still relevant ... the evidence of why they are still relevant is that a lot of companies and countries want to host @entity76			0
" participant countries have different reasons to be in @entity11			0
@entity101 and the @entity102 , with strong trade and diplomatic ties to @entity12 , respectively , have been two of the more popular pavilions			1
earlier this year a 20 - year deal for @entity101 to supply @entity12 with natural gas was signed between the two countries , but pavilion manager @entity110 was keen to stress that the reason for their participation at event " is about people , not business relationships			1
" @entity117 , ceo of the @entity118 , believes the event is unique in its scope and potential			1
" it 's the only place where you can create something that has a critical mass around it ; it 's a very large event			1
it 's a big tourism opportunity for some , for others it 's about trade , " he said			1
for developing countries like @entity133 , participation is a way to draw attention to a little known country , either as a holiday destination or potential trading partner			0
" we do n't see it as being old fashioned , " said @entity139 of @entity133 's pavilion			0
" we are building our country since 2002 ... if you search for an official tourism website in @entity133 you ca n't find it , so we have to find other ways to show our country			0
there 's a lot of work ahead for our country and this is part of it			0
" for all the fostering of relationships and networking over glasses of sweet tea or @entity58 , ultimately the biggest tangible benefit of the event goes to @entity11 itself			2
the city is little known by people within @entity12 let alone internationally , but around $ 2billion spent on operations and facilities from the government , @entity78 and private investors has completely transformed it			1
" this area is relatively backwards and needs a boost , " said @entity90 , saying it is part of a larger project to develop @entity12 's southern " @entity168 "			1
" it will put @entity11 on the map			0
we have big ambitions to be a famous marine resort area			2
" @entity11 's infrastructure has been upgraded , with new , marble - smooth roads cutting through the lush hillsides and along the coast , while the train to the capital @entity182 now takes half the time it used to			0
while it is still undecided what will happen to most of the expo site when it closes -- conference centers and shopping malls have been mooted -- and tourism to the region develops , there will be an immediate beneficiary of the improved infrastructure : the petrochemical industry			2
just a few miles from the expo is one of @entity12 's biggest industrial complexes that dwarfs the expo site and is the area 's largest industry			1
" for the moment we just want domestic development , " says @entity90 , " secondary is marine resort development			2
