@entity0 -- reports coming from @entity3 suggest that hundreds of people have been injured by a meteor falling from space			1
the force of the fireball , which seems to have crashed into a lake near the town of @entity11 in the @entity12 , roared through the sky early on friday morning local time , blowing out windows and damaging buildings			0
this comes on the same day that astronomers and news reporters alike were turning their attention to a 40 meter asteroid -- known as 2012 @entity22 -- which is due for a close approach with @entity24 on friday evening			1
the asteroid will skirt around our planet , however , missing by some 27,000 kilometers ( 16,777 miles )			1
based on early reports , there is no reason to believe the two events are connected			0

it is easy to think of a serene solar system , with the eight planets quietly orbiting around the @entity41 and only a few moons for company			0
the reality is that we also share our cosmic neighborhood with millions of other , much smaller bodies : asteroids			0
made of rock and metal , they range in size from a few meters across , up to the largest -- @entity53 -- which is 1000 kilometers wide			2
they are left over rubble from the chaotic birth of our solar system around 5000 million years ago and , for the most part , are found in a " belt " between the orbits of @entity62 and @entity63			2
but some are known to move away from this region , either due to collisions with other asteroids or the gravitational pull of a planet			0
and that can bring them into close proximity to the @entity24			1

traveling through the sky at a few kilometers per second , friction with the air can cause the meteor to break up into several pieces			1
eyewitnesses have described seeing a burst of light and hearing loud , thunderous noises			0
this , too , is due to the object tearing through the gases above our heads			0
if any of the fragments make it to the ground , only then are they called meteorites			0
such events are rare , but not unprecedented			0
an object entered @entity24 's atmosphere in 1908 before breaking up over @entity101			1
the force of the explosion laid waste to a dense area of forest covering more than 2000 square kilometers			1
it is not hard to imagine the devastation of such an event over a more highly populated region			0
the @entity24 is sprinkled with around 170 craters also caused by debris falling from space			1
the largest is found near the town of @entity115 in @entity116			0
the impact of a much larger asteroid -- perhaps as big as 15 kilometers across -- is famously thought to have finished off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago			2
opinion : do n't count ' doomsday asteroid ' out yet it is easy to see why , then , that astronomers are keen to discover the position and trajectory of as many asteroids as possible			0
that way they can work out where they are heading and when , if at all , they might pose a threat to us on @entity24			2
it is precisely this sort of work that led to the discovery of asteroid 2012 @entity22 last february by a team of @entity140 astronomers			0
however , today 's meteor strike shows that it is not currently possible to pick up everything			2
a non-profit foundation , led by former @entity146 astronaut @entity145 , wants to send a dedicated asteroid - hunting telescope into space that can scan the solar system for any potential threats			1
for now , astronomers will use friday 's fly - by to bounce radar beams off 2012 @entity22 's surface , hoping to learn more about its motion and structure			0
one day this information could be used to help move an asteroid out of an @entity24 - impacting orbit			1
this latest meteor over @entity3 just goes to show how important such work is and how crucial it is that we keep our eye on the sky			1

meteor explosion above @entity3 left hundreds of people injured
@entity174 came on day asteroid *expected* to pass 27,000 kilometers from @entity24
@entity24 is sprinkled with around 170 craters also caused by debris falling from space
@entity169 says un*expected* meteor shows importance of *monitoring* space for potential threats
