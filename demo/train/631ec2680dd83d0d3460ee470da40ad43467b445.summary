@entity0 -- the @entity2 has taken up the @entity3 , a measure that would protect gay , lesbian and transgender employees in the workplace			1

the first version of the @entity3 was introduced in the @entity34 and the @entity2			1

opponents of the president 's decision challenged the administration , leading to the @entity118 case @entity119 v. @entity120			0
april 2012 : with just more than six months until @entity121 , @entity71 told @entity23 advocates that he would not sign an executive order that would prohibit federal contracts from discriminating against gay and transgender workers			1
it was a major disappointment to the activists			0
essentially it was enda for federal contractors			0
at the time , @entity131 , president of the group @entity132 to work , said this executive order was an easy initiative			2
it was " the low - hanging fruit , " he said			0
may 2012 : just a month later , @entity71 came out in support of same - sex marriage			1
