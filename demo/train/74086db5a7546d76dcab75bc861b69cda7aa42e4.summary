-- @entity2 tensions will remain high on the agenda at the @entity4 on thursday with @entity6 prime minister @entity5 stepping up to the podium soon after @entity9 leader @entity8			1
here are five things to look out for during the third day of the session : 1			0
the @entity9 are set to seek a new status at the @entity13 , but @entity5 is focused on @entity14			1
a year after launching the @entity16 's failed bid to win @entity13 recognition as an independent state , @entity8 is expected thursday to formally announce a less ambitious initiative			1
this time , the @entity16 will seek non-member observer status , one step up from its current position as a permanent observer			1
last year 's attempt to secure recognition of statehood stalled in the @entity27			0
the @entity9 say they are likely to submit the new resolution after the @entity30 presidential election on november 6 in an effort to prevent the issue from becoming political fodder			0
they have already expressed concern about pessimistic comments by @entity37 presidential nominee @entity36 about the chances for peace in the region			0
@entity8 is scheduled to make his speech toward the end of the morning session			2
two slots after him comes @entity6 's @entity5 , who is likely to focus more on the perceived threat from @entity14 than the lifeless peace process with the @entity9			1
the issue of how to respond to @entity14 's controversial nuclear program has put a strain on relations between @entity5 and president @entity51			1
@entity52 insists its atomic program is for peaceful purposes , but @entity56 leaders say they believe it is aimed at building a weapon			0
@entity5 has been pushing the @entity30 to establish a clear " red line " that @entity14 can not cross if it wants to avoid war			1
@entity6 feels a sense of urgency , as negotiations aimed at curbing @entity14 's nuclear ambitions have failed to produce an agreement and the effectiveness of sanctions on @entity52 remains unclear			1
world powers will meet on the @entity14 issue a day after @entity69 complains of double standards			1
the @entity14 nuclear controversy is one of the recurring themes of this year 's assembly			1
@entity5 's speech and a ministerial meeting of global powers are likely to keep it in the spotlight thursday			1
@entity51 said tuesday that he remained committed to a diplomatic solution to the issue but that " the @entity30 will do what we must to prevent @entity14 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			1
" five things we learned on @entity86 @entity14 president @entity69 , who has a history of controversial statements , gave onlookers little in the way of outrage in his eighth and final speech at the annual gathering on wednesday			2
he said @entity14 was committed to peace , though he also accused world powers of double standards in pursuing an arms race			2
" continued threat by the uncivilized @entity99 to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality , " @entity69 said			0
ways to resolve the problem peacefully will be discussed by officials from @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity30 at a side meeting thursday , and a minister - level meeting is expected to follow			1
the @entity115 , the @entity13 's nuclear watchdog , overwhelmingly passed a resolution this month voicing concern about @entity14 's continued nuclear activity and urging @entity52 to cooperate with international nuclear regulators			1
@entity69 tells @entity13 that @entity14 is threatened 3			2
the president of @entity122 gets a chance to steal some of @entity125 's spotlight in the @entity30			1
a less gloomy storyline will be in evidence in the speech to the assembly thursday by president @entity130 of @entity122 , who has overseen a series of political reforms in the @entity134 nation that has spent decades under repressive military rule			2
while the @entity30 and the @entity137 have been piling sanctions on @entity14 , they have also been steadily lifting them off @entity122 in response to the release of hundreds political prisoners , the pursuit of peace talks with ethnic rebels and the holding of freer elections			1
the latest softening of sanctions by @entity149 was announced wednesday by secretary of state @entity150 , following a meeting with @entity130			0
the @entity30 will begin easing restrictions on the import of goods from @entity122 , @entity152 said			2
@entity130 , a former military official , will have a chance thursday to grab some of the spotlight from @entity125 , the @entity122 opposition leader and @entity159 laureate who received the @entity160 last week during a 17 - day visit to the @entity30			2
diplomats and journalists are wondering if @entity125 , who spent the better part of two decades under house arrest in @entity122 for her pro-democracy campaigning , will be in the audience for @entity130 's speech			1
she has expressed support for @entity130 's efforts and even admitted to having a " soft spot " for some of the military leaders who kept her in detention			0
but she and others have also cautioned that @entity122 's reforms are still at a very early , fragile stage			1
@entity111 is n't sending its a-team , but it could still cause a stir			0
most world leaders have n't passed up the opportunity to take their turn at the assembly 's green marble podium this year , but @entity111 's top officials have other things on their minds running the the rising global power			1
president @entity189 and @entity190 appear to have skipped the trip to @entity192 amid the political intrigue and jockeying in @entity195 ahead of a once - in - a - decade leadership transition widely expected to kick off next month			0
this handover of power is especially sensitive in the wake of a dramatic political scandal involving murder and attempted defection that has played out in the international news media			0
as a result , foreign minister @entity204 is leading the @entity111 delegation at the assembly , and he will have plenty of subject matter at his disposal when he makes his speech during the afternoon session			0
many observers will be waiting to see if he addresses @entity111 's myriad disputes with several of its neighbors over maritime territories			2
@entity111 's most heated dispute at the moment is with @entity219 over a set of islands in the @entity222 , a quarrel that has prompted violent @entity225 protests in @entity111 and soured economic ties between the two nations			2
prime minister @entity228 of @entity219 referred indirectly to the situation in his speech to the assembly on wednesday , underscoring @entity233 's commitment to using international law to resolve territorial disputes			0
the @entity238 in @entity195 quickly dismissed @entity228 's comments as " self - deceiving , " the state - run news agency @entity236 reported thursday			0
the question now is whether @entity204 will have more to say on the matter in the @entity13 's @entity242			0
@entity244 leader speaks amid the fallout from the attack that killed @entity30 ambassador and other @entity30			0
the president of @entity244 's @entity249 , @entity250 , is expected to address the assembly during the afternoon session			1
his nation 's young government is dealing with the delicate aftermath of the attack on the @entity30 diplomatic compound in the city of @entity259 this month that killed @entity30 ambassador @entity260 and three other @entity30			0
on monday , @entity152 praised the @entity244 people for their efforts to rid the country of the rogue militias blamed for the killings			0
@entity266 has said the militias would be disbanded			0
the episode has laid bare the challenges @entity244 government officials face in imposing control on the country following the uprising that led to the fall of the dictator @entity274 , who was known for long , rambling orations at the @entity13			2
@entity51 said tuesday that unrest was occurring in the throes of an unfinished regional revolution in the @entity2 that brought an end to oppressive regimes in @entity281 , @entity244 and @entity282			0
@entity283 speaks via satellite from @entity285 , calls for end to ' persecution '			0

@entity8 is expected to seek new status for @entity16
@entity6 's @entity5 is likely to focus on the @entity14 nuclear issue
officials from @entity122 , @entity111 and @entity244 are also among the speakers
