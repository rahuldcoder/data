what is beauty ? what role does it have in spirituality ? is it in the eye of the beholder ? these seemingly innocuous questions have snowballed into a bitter polemic on the @entity12 altar , where a battle of aesthetic titans has ensued : religious scholars versus the so - called " starchitects " who have earned multimillion - dollar contracts to build megachurches for the new millennium			2
to arbitrate , @entity22 photographer @entity21 looked to find meaning in these newly built houses of @entity25			1
" i wanted to photograph new - but - already - established churches from this millennium ... but i had to explain to a lot of people that i was n't documenting the demise of the @entity30 or even the loss of churchgoers but how these churches have now become part of the establishment , " he said			1
from @entity36 to @entity37 , @entity21 zigzagged through cities where celebrity architects hoped their designs would add to @entity22 's great architectural landscape			1
photographing the works of architectural giants such as @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and others , @entity21 explored whether there is a historical continuum with the traditions of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and other artistic geniuses whose religious reverence helped build some of the world 's greatest monuments			1
@entity21 used a formal approach , photographing these churches from an egalitarian perspective			1
his camera takes a centralized position to allow the architectural concepts to get fair play			2
photography , he hoped , could translate the aesthetic decisions behind some very controversial and expensive designs that , to some people , are unrecognizable as churches			1
in @entity36 , which hosts the @entity71 , @entity21 photographed @entity45 's @entity72			1
standing in what was a depressed steelwork factory , the church has received endless accolades by design experts around the world			0
but it has also been criticized by @entity80 members and religious scholars who say they are extremely materialistic , devoid of spiritual references and divorced from the @entity12 dogma			1
at the other end of the discussion , these new architects are building a new vision for the future			1
@entity45 's work is often called " revolutionary " and " genius , " and some have put it in the company of @entity95 and @entity96			1
the crux of the issue : is there a continuum with the past ? does it follow the @entity30 's norms , defined by decree , for what is a church ? in an online interview , @entity45 acknowledged the struggle			1
" to build a church nowadays is to come face to face with millenary history and , whether i like it or not , i find myself ( confronting ) these historical issues , " he said			0
@entity21 said that when he stood outside photographing these churches , he rarely got a positive response			1
" i know you ca n't build @entity117 churches today , but there is definitely a disconnect between the populace and the ideas of these architects , " @entity21 said			1
" the big issue is that we are in search of a model that can represent our era			0
and we have n't found one			0
" @entity80 officials have lashed out against what they see as a diversion from dictates on how to build a church according to catholic liturgy			0
these laws , however , have been subject to interpretation			0
social media follow @ @entity138 on @entity139 to join the conversation about photography			0
the @entity143 , for instance , defends its decision to stand by @entity45 's design , claiming it adheres to @entity12 dogma on aesthetics			2
the seven - tower church with skylights is a symbolic play on the use of natural light in ritual and divinity			0
the industrial - looking church complex blends in with the area associated with @entity36 's working class			2
to the common eye , these towers may seem more like giant chimneys , a reference to the industrial , working - class area			0
photographing inside this monumental building is a different story			2
liturgical tradition is referenced , but only slightly			0
@entity21 photographs the pixelated image of the @entity169 , a " half - cross " by the altar , every element illuminated by natural light			0
a possible allusion that @entity25 is omnipresent in the digital age ? in @entity37 , @entity46 was tasked to build a church in the city 's somewhat derelict outskirts of @entity37 in an area called @entity180			2
perched like a white pearl amid tired tower blocks and parking lots , @entity46 's @entity181 is simple and reflects light like other @entity46 buildings			1
it is a clean , clear - cut design			0
but where is the recognizable iconography and other elements that help situate @entity30 in this era of rationalist architecture ? @entity21 , who said his style is really photojournalism , has great interest in social issues			0
photographing modern buildings makes sense in his body of work , he said			2
" i approach architecture in the same way			0
i am interested in how man is placed in this design , even though i photograph these buildings without people , " he said			2
" they are not there , but i still like to narrate their story			0
" @entity210 is an @entity22 photographer based in @entity211			1
you can follow him on @entity213 and @entity139 .			0

despite expensive price tags and celebrity architects , @entity22 's new churches have their critics
some say the buildings are too materialistic and lack a connection with the past
others have *praised* the architects for building a new vision of the future
