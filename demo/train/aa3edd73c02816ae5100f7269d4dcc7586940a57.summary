seventy one years ago -- december 22 , 1942 -- @entity0 got the @entity1 out of what had turned into an unexpectedly embarrassing situation			1
it concerned the @entity5 -- specifically , something called the @entity6			1
most people today have likely never heard of it , but the @entity6 was once a constant part of the country 's life			0
until 1892 , there was no such thing as a @entity5			1
@entity14 , the owner of a magazine called @entity16 , was on a crusade to put @entity1 flags in every school in the country			0
he sensed that the @entity1 needed a boost of patriotism			0
keep in mind : not even 30 years before , the @entity24 had still been raging			2
national unity was a fragile concept			0
as part of the campaign , @entity27 gave an assignment to a member of his staff : @entity33 , who was an author , a minister and an advocate of the tenets of @entity38 socialism			0
@entity27 asked @entity39 to compose a @entity5 to the flag			1
@entity39 wrote it , and it was published in the magazine			0
it did n't take long for the @entity5 to become wildly popular , even omnipresent			1
at schools , at campgrounds , at public gatherings , in @entity0 , people routinely faced the flag and pledged their allegiance to it			1
because , inherently , there is something physically awkward about people simply standing in place , their arms hanging limply by their sides , staring at a flag and reciting a pledge , it was decided that devising a salute would be appropriate			2
instructions for carrying out the salute were printed in the pages of @entity16			2
the gesture came to be called the @entity6 , in honor of the @entity5 's author			1
the @entity6 consisted of each person -- man , woman or child -- extending his or her right arm straight forward , angling slightly upward , fingers pointing directly ahead			0
with their right arms aiming stiffly toward the flag , they recited : " i pledge allegiance ... " for a while , the salute was n't especially controversial			2
but , as @entity80 was forming in @entity81 , and @entity82 and @entity83 began saluting @entity84 and @entity85 with extended - armed " @entity86 ! " - style gestures ... well , perhaps you can see the problem			1
in the @entity1 there was a growing feeling of discomfort that , when people within the nation 's own borders pledged their right - arms - extended allegiance to the flag , they might be construed as inadvertently showing solidarity with the fascist regimes across the ocean			2
@entity102 , in his book " to the flag : the @entity105 of the @entity5 , " wrote that " the similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid- 1930s			1
" newsreels and still photos were regularly depicting rallies in @entity81 's dictatorships , with thousands of people showing their fealty by extending straight - armed salutes			1
in the @entity1 , the general unease about it -- " the embarrassing resemblance between the ' @entity86 ' salute and the salute that accompanied the @entity5 , " in @entity122 's words -- was combined with the fear that scenes of @entity1 offering the @entity6 could be used for propaganda purposes			1
it would n't be terribly difficult to crop the @entity1 flag out of photos of @entity1 citizens reciting the @entity5 ; without the flag in the shots , the photos could be mischaracterized as proof that @entity1 were expressing support for the ideologies of @entity86 and @entity84			2
thus , on december 22 , 1942 , @entity0 , just before its @entity136 break , took care of it			2
on that day , the amended @entity139 was passed , section 7 of which decreed that the @entity5 should " be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart			1
" and with that , it became official : those millions of extended right arms were brought down			0
the stiff - armed salute was for other people , in countries far away			1
it was purely symbolic , of course , but symbols are powerful			0
over the years , there have been various disputes about the @entity5 , the most basic of which is the question of whether citizens should even be expected to publicly pledge their allegiance to their country			1
the @entity1 was founded on ideals of freedom , and freedom includes not being forced , or cajoled by peer pressure , into publicly declaring any belief			0
the exact wording of the @entity5 has changed several times since @entity168 wrote it ; each change was reflective of contemporaneous concerns about the meaning			1
for example : " i pledge allegiance to the flag " was originally " i pledge allegiance to my flag			0
" the " my " was dropped out of worries that recent arrivals from other nations might be seen as pledging their loyalty to the flag of the country of their birth			0
the most significant change in the wording came in 1954 , when -- with the enthusiastic support of president @entity188 -- the phrase " under @entity190 " was added just after " one nation			0
" @entity188 declared : " in this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in @entity1 's heritage and future ; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country 's most powerful resource in peace and war			0
" the wording of the @entity5 may or may not be changed again in centuries to come , but it 's a pretty safe bet that the @entity6 is never coming back			2
once ubiquitous and unquestioned , it has become a faded and mostly forgotten bit of @entity1 history			0
all because , 71 decembers ago , a solution to a quandary -- a quandary no one could have anticipated when the @entity5 was written -- was formalized : lower those stiff arms			1
and take them to heart .			0

after the @entity5 was written , a stiff - armed salute was developed to accompany it
@entity220 writes that its meaning got *clouded* when @entity224 movements used similar salute
after *outbreak* of @entity80 , @entity0 passed *legislation* to *replace* the salute
@entity220 : 71 years ago , the practice of placing your hand over the heart was adopted
