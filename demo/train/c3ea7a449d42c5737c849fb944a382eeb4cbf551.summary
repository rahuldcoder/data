it was clear from the statement from the @entity2 on monday that the @entity3 is deeply annoyed with @entity4			1
couched in diplomatic language , the statement spelled out @entity8 's position : @entity4 dropped the ball on @entity10 and the @entity3 wants @entity11 to pick it up			1
" we are disappointed by the decision of the authorities in @entity4 to permit mr. @entity10 to flee despite the legally valid @entity3 request to arrest him for purposes of his extradition under the @entity3 - @entity20 , " said @entity2 spokeswoman @entity12 in a statement			1
" we have registered our strong objections to the authorities in @entity4 as well as to the @entity23 government through diplomatic channels and noted that such behavior is detrimental to @entity3 - @entity4 and @entity3 - @entity23 bilateral relations			2
" the statement went on to remind @entity11 that the @entity3 had in the past returned numerous high - level criminals at the request of the @entity11 government			0
" we expect the @entity11 government to look at all options available to expel mr. @entity10 back to the @entity3 to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged			2
" while there has been speculation that @entity38 was behind the final decision to allow @entity40 leaker @entity10 to leave @entity4 -- a semi-autonomous @entity23 territory -- on sunday , @entity4 authorities insist the judicial process was independent of @entity23			1
@entity43 - man , director of the @entity44 at the @entity45 , downplayed the apparent spat between @entity8 and @entity47 saying there may be nothing more to the @entity4 decision than what it has publicly maintained : that @entity8 failed to meet the requirements under @entity4 law that would have allowed the police to detain @entity10			1
" we do n't know all the details as to why the @entity4 government said the paperwork for the request was not in place ; maybe the @entity3 government rushed in sending their package over and really did n't submit a good set of documents , " @entity56 said , adding that he thought the response from the @entity58 had been fairly measured			2
nevertheless , he said that getting a provisional warrant in order required a " low threshold " of preparation			0
" why did n't @entity4 authorities move more quickly ? @entity4 authorities would probably say this is just our protocol , this is how we do these things and in this case we did n't see any reason to make it an exception or treat it with any greater urgency			0
" a @entity58 official said that the @entity3 had met requirements and disputed the assertion from @entity4 's government			2
despite fears bilateral ties between the @entity3 and @entity4 could be damaged , @entity56 said the relationship between the two governments was too deep and longstanding for the extradition drama to have any permanent affect			0
" it may well be they will just sort of brush it under the carpet as a regrettable incident and it probably wo n't have any implications beyond that , " @entity56 said			0
" it 's probably too early to say , but my intuition is that there probably wo n't be too much ( fallout from @entity10 )			0
" while the @entity4 statement on @entity10 pointedly requested a clarification from @entity8 of @entity10 's claims that the @entity3 had hacked targets in the territory , @entity56 said he believed that this was aimed at domestic concerns over @entity10 rather than any veiled attack on @entity8			1
" it simply says to the @entity4 people you 've expressed a lot of concern about this , @entity108 ( the territory 's chief executive ) has said he is going to make inquiries and i think it just reiterated that , " he said			0
other analysts said that @entity4 and @entity38 were probably relieved that a potentially protracted and embarrassing diplomatic problem was now outside their jurisdiction			2
@entity123 , a leading foreign relations scholar and associate dean of @entity126 's @entity125 in @entity38 , told @entity4 's @entity127 that @entity10 's departure was ideal for @entity38			1
" a time bomb that could threaten the @entity23 - @entity3 relationship has been defused , even though the saga will go on and @entity10 can still make more revelations			0
the strategy @entity38 has been using in dealing with the case was to let @entity4 handle it independently and keep a distance from it			1
i believe @entity38 would not proactively take advantage of the intelligence @entity10 revealed , because that would provoke @entity8 and rub salt into its wounds			1
" @entity123 also told the paper : " actually @entity38 made some gains from the @entity10 saga , because his revelations provided @entity38 some bargaining chips for future negotiations with @entity8 in cybersecurity ; @entity8 has lost the moral high ground on this front			2
" analysts say @entity23 has used @entity10 's claims that the @entity3 hacked computer networks in @entity4 and the mainland to put the @entity3 on the defensive in their ongoing cybersecurity dispute			1
meanwhile , analysts will be waiting anxiously to see if @entity8 files any official complaint over the matter			0
whether the requisite amount of face -- an essential part of the @entity23 diplomatic discourse -- has been saved from the @entity10 saga has still to play out			0
" i think in the long run ( it will be resolved ) , but there will be questions asked , " @entity56 said .			0

@entity8 sends *tersely* worded statement to @entity4 over @entity10 case
understated language spells out @entity3 anger that @entity10 was allowed to leave for @entity173
speculation strong @entity38 was behind decision to allow @entity10 to leave @entity4
analysts say @entity4 acted within its laws and independently of @entity38
