under another law , tenants would have had to prove they were citizens or lawful residents , register with the city and pay for a rental permit in order to receive an occupancy permit			0
the ordinances were copied by other cities			0
both were challenged before going into effect and found unconstitutional in 2007 by a @entity22 @entity21			2

" this ruling is a loss for @entity3 and its legal residents			0
