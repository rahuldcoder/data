@entity0 -- its windows are boarded up , the red - painted exterior is peeling and the roof could do with re-tiling -- but this derelict house in a village in the @entity9 region of @entity10 was once the home of @entity13 artist @entity12			1
the house and surrounding industrial area , in the village of @entity17 , might not look too impressive , but it was here that @entity12 decided to become an artist			1
now local authorities have agreed a deal with the owner of the house to rent it for 27 years , with the aim of turning it into a museum and possibly a guest - house , in time for the city 's partnership with neighboring @entity31 , the @entity32 in 2015			1
an exhibition covering @entity12 's time in the region is planned for the @entity36 , while a documentary exploring the artist 's life as an evangelical preacher among the mining community there is also in the works , with the house sure to feature			1
" there is [ currently ] no one living in the house , " said @entity45 , a spokesperson for the municipality of @entity47			2
" you have four walls , you have something that looks like a roof and that 's it			0
" the municipality plans to fully restore the house , so that it will eventually look as it did when @entity12 lived there			1
it is an important cultural resource to the local area , said @entity45			0
" we are a very poor region and it 's really amazing to know that someone as celebrated as @entity12 stayed there , " he said			2
according to @entity65 , an expert on @entity12 at the @entity66 in @entity67 , local people in the @entity9 still " have a lot of sympathy for @entity12 himself , because he had an eye for their needs and troubles			2
" @entity12 's humanistic side was developed during this time and he even tried to endure the same hardships as the impoverished miners , said @entity65			1
but it was when he was discharged from his job as a preacher that he made the decision , on the advice of his brother , to become an artist			0
" it was a struggle to make this decision and he had to work really hard , which is what he did -- he drew hundreds and hundreds of drawings before he saw himself fit to be an artist , " said @entity65			0
few of these early sketches survive , but a drawing entitled " mine workers in the snow " from 1880 and in the collection at the @entity104 in @entity105 , the @entity13 , depicts workers trudging towards a mine which looms darkly in the background			0
in a letter to his brother in 1880 , @entity12 said of the drawing : " i have made a hasty scribble of miners and haulers ( both boys and girls ) going to the shaft in the morning through the snow , by a path along a thorn hedge ; passing shadows , dimly visible in the twilight			0
" according to @entity119 , there is very little evidence left of @entity12 's time in the @entity9 , which is why the house is so important			1
the area , too , is changing rapidly , with the mining industry now almost completely gone			0
" i have a lot of sympathy for that region , " said @entity65			0
" from the tourist point of view [ the house ] would help the region get some attention , " he said			0
@entity12 lovers will hopefully be able to visit the restored house in 2015			2
and for those who ca n't wait , an exhibition entitled " @entity135 " opens at the @entity137 in february , while the @entity66 in @entity67 is currently focusing on @entity12 's studio practice .			1
