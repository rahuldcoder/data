-- scientists studying the carcass of what they call the heaviest squid ever found have discovered it has eyes as big as soccer balls -- reportedly the largest in the world			1
scientists are interviewed while two colossal squids are defrosted			1
the one on the right is missing part of its body			0
the colossal squid 's eyes were measured at about 27 centimeters ( 10.8 inches ) across by researchers , who have been defrosting it and a smaller specimen at @entity19 , the national museum of @entity21			1
" this is the only intact eye ( of a colossal squid ) that 's ever been found			1
it 's spectacular , " squid specialist @entity25 of the @entity26 told @entity27 on wednesday			2
@entity25 , one of a team of international scientists brought in to examine the creature , added : " it 's the largest known eye in the animal kingdom			2
" his assertion was backed up by @entity37 professor @entity36 of the @entity38 , who specializes in vision in invertebrates			0
" this is the largest eye ever recorded in history and studied , " @entity36 told @entity27 " it has a huge lens the size of an orange and captures an awful lot of light in the dark depths in which it hunts			0
" scientists snaked a camera into the colossal squid 's body and measured its beak and tentacles in an exam broadcast live on the @entity57			1
" it did n't seem really fair that only a handful of people would get to see an animal like this up close , " said @entity58 , a marine biologist at the @entity26			0
he led a team that examined the corps of the colossal squid on monday , tuesday and wednesday in a lab at @entity68 's @entity19			1
" it 's the end of three days without much sleep , " @entity58 told @entity0			0
" it 's been an exhausting exercise			0
" blog dispatches from the lab provided updates ( " they 're going to rotate the @entity77 ! " ) peppered with commentary ( " anything with lots of legs / tentacles gives me the willies but if it 's here -- and not moving is a plus in my book -- you have to touch ! " ) a @entity21 fishing boat snagged the squid in february 2007 , as it sought toothfish in the @entity94 waters of the @entity95			2
the crew hauled in a line with many baited hooks and discovered a massive squid feasting on one of the hooked fish , the museum says on its web site			0
researchers determined it was a colossal squid , a species first documented in 2003 that tends to weigh more than the also - big giant squid			1
the larger colossal squid that scientists examined this week weighed 1,091 pounds ( 495 kilograms ) and measured about 32 feet ( 10 meters ) , the museum said			1
" we probably have more questions than we have answers now , " @entity58 said just after completing the exam			0
yet the team made at least one key finding			0
when they measured the colossal squid 's beak , @entity58 said , they were stunned to discover that it was shorter than colossal - squid beaks recovered from the stomachs of sperm whales , which prey on squid			1
that led @entity58 to conclude that even heavier colossal squid lurk somewhere below the surface , unseen by human eyes			2
" they grow considerably larger , " he said			0

researchers defrosting two colossal squid at @entity21 's national museum
the larger one has eyes around 27 cm across , believed to be world 's biggest
it weighs almost half a tonne and measures about 32 feet ( 10 meters ) in length
scientists believe that there may be even larger colossal squids in existence
