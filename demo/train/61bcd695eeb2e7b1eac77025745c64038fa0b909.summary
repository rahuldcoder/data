-- this year , nearly 300,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer			1
with october being @entity4 , we are blessed that for 31 days each year , a global community joins together to support survival , find new treatments and develop a cure			1
while early stage breast cancer survival rates remain high -- with many women and men going on to live long , healthy lives -- there is no cure for advanced breast cancer			1
@entity16 breast cancer -- @entity17 ( metastatic ) -- is a chronic disease for which there will be no remission or survival			1
many of us do n't realize that 20 % to 30 % of all breast cancer cases will become metastatic			1
i know this personally because i experienced it with my mom , @entity28 , when she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2007			1
my mother was warm , funny and smart			2
in her response to living with advanced breast cancer , her most striking quality was her extraordinary strength			1
when she was first diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in 2004 , she had hope and determination that we would fight the cancer and win			1
and we did , for a short time , at least			0
when it returned as metastatic disease during the start of the 2008 presidential campaign , our family felt disappointment and shock , but my mom 's hope remained intact			2
even though she knew the disease was not cureable , she was inspired to make sure her remaining time on @entity50 had meaning			0
she relished making each and every day count for herself and for the people she loved			0
one of her goals , and mine , was that her positive days would outnumber the negative ones			0
and we certainly accomplished that goal			0
living with hope , however , requires a great deal of effort for those who are confronted with this disease			2
advanced breast cancer is different than early stage breast cancer because the treatment path is much more winding			1
with early stage breast cancer , we knew that there was a treatment path and only one objective -- we wanted the cancer gone			1
we could set our lives aside briefly and threw everything we had at the disease			0
my mom was invested in the best treatment , no matter how aggressive ; and as her daughter , i was invested in her survival regardless of the short - term cost to us			0
@entity16 breast cancer was a very different experience			1
this time my mom 's treatment path seemed more daunting and there was no clear timeline to guide us ; the cancer would be with us for the remainder of her life			2
unlike with early stage breast cancer , we needed to make peace with that fact			1
instead of putting life off , my mom did the opposite			0
she lived with purpose and created meaningful moments , not knowing how many days we would have left			2
time is actually a bit of a paradox for people living with advanced cancer and for those who support them			2
on the one hand , we are grateful for time and want nothing but more of it			0
on the other hand , that very uncertainty about how much time is left can leave patients and their loved ones reeling with anxiety			0
for example , if my mom had a headache or back pain , our imaginations could run wild			0
" was this the sign of a tumor progression ? " " did this mean our time was drawing near ? " this would remain an underlying fear until her next scan , when ( as my mom would say ) , we hoped she did n't " light up like a christmas tree			0
" but despite this reality of advanced breast cancer , or perhaps because of it , we embraced each day we had together			1
the value of that embrace , even if it was just being there , together , was one of the most important lessons i learned from advanced breast cancer			1
i was n't living in the same state with my mom during her years with advanced breast cancer , but we talked often by phone and she always knew i was there for her			1
and she was there for me too , always telling me , " do n't forget about yourself			0
" she recognized the support i was giving her			2
but as my mother , she also wanted to continue giving me love and support and encouragement to keep following my dreams			2
as her daughter , at times as her caregiver , i never felt like there was quite enough i could do			0
but for both of us , the simple act of being together was what mattered			0
though my mom passed away nearly three years ago , i am still a part of a very important community			0
today , i want to raise awareness about the unique challenges that face those living with advanced breast cancer			1
and i do mean living			0
many of these women are caring for small children , still working and planning for future life events like weddings and grandchildren			0
their focus , like my mom 's , is making each day count			0
that is why advanced breast cancer needs not only dollars to help fuel research advances , but solid support from all of us -- family , friends , co-workers or anyone touched by the disease			1
and that is why i 've joined the @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity178 program to help amplify the voice for the advanced breast cancer community			1
i 'm asking everyone to join in with me and support a community that so desperately needs a voice			2
