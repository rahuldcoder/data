@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 troops are surrounding the city of @entity5 , awaiting orders to enter what had been a stronghold for late dictator @entity9 as those inside appeal to the international community for help			1
@entity13 , a local official , told @entity2 late friday that @entity5 was under siege with no food or fuel able to get in , nor even fresh oxygen for its main hospital			2
the standoff -- and possible military offensive -- stems from the death of a @entity1 revolutionary fighter from @entity23 credited with capturing @entity9 last year			1
@entity24 and two other fighters were kidnapped near @entity5 in july			2
he was released two months later , at which point he was in bad shape physically			0
after being transferred to a hospital @entity29 , @entity24 died september 24 of the aftereffects of gunshot wounds			0
one day after his death , the country 's @entity32 authorized the @entity1 ministries of defense and interior to use force , if necessary , to arrest those responsible for allegedly kidnapping and torturing @entity24			2
the national assembly also called for the release of the others being detained in @entity5 , giving those in the city 10 days to comply -- or else the @entity46 nation 's military would take action			1
the deadline for that ultimatum was friday			0
and over the past week , @entity1 army troops and militia members from different parts of the nation -- including @entity23 -- mobilized and surrounded @entity5			1
@entity5 and @entity23 have a longstanding rivalry			0
the chief of staff for @entity1 's army issued a statement thursday calling on the people of @entity5 to cooperate by handing over the wanted individuals to avoid a military assault			1
yet many in @entity5 remained defiant friday , turning out in large numbers to protest the national government 's demands and call for the release of those from the city being held about 130 kilometers ( 80 miles ) to the northeast in @entity23 , according to @entity13			1
" they treat us as if @entity5 is not part of @entity1 , " the city official said			1
hundreds of @entity5 residents have been arrested by armed militias , according to the human rights advocacy group @entity74			1
many continue to be detained without being charged , or put in trial , across @entity1 , and have been tortured or otherwise ill - treated , @entity74 said			0
meanwhile , talks are ongoing to resolve the issue in @entity5 , without the use of force , @entity13 added			0
but he said that many residents are " anticipating a military offensive , but will not leave the city and are ready to die in @entity5			2
" @entity5 was a holdout of @entity86 loyalists until the very end of the fighting late last year			0
and tensions between residents and fighters aligned with what was the @entity93 -- and later the fledgling @entity1 government -- continued to simmer after the city 's fall			1
a petition was being circulated friday around the inland city , which is about 170 kilometers southeast of the capital , @entity0 , asked the @entity100 to convene an emergency meeting and act " to immediately intervene to protect the civilians in the town			0
" the petitioners claimed that pro-government " armed militias " were trying to indiscriminately kill large numbers of people in @entity5 , because of the city 's history in support of @entity9			1
they report " bombing on civil neighborhoods " on october 1 " with no regards to the lives of unarmed civilians			0
" " the @entity1 government claims that it is trying to arrest some criminals in the town			0
but the question is : could those criminals be arrested with mortars , missiles and a ban on daily necessary requirements ? " @entity74 joined those calling for restraint friday night			0
it issued a statement urging " @entity1 authorities to avoid unnecessary and excessive use of force in the city and to ensure essential medical supplies are allowed into the city			2
