-- should the government keep its hands off online shopping ? according to the massive response to our stories on a proposed internet sales tax , many of you think so			1
on monday , the @entity10 approved the @entity11			1
it would allow governments to collect taxes on sales that @entity17 retailers , from titans such as @entity19 and @entity20 to independent app developers , make in their state			1
the point , supporters say , is to put traditional brick - and - mortar retailers on equal footing with digital storefronts that , in many cases , have n't been required to add tax to their prices			1
but in an age when many of us have gotten used to one - click , 24 - hour shopping on our laptops , tablets and phones , not many of the readers of our story monday explaining the bill seemed overly excited at the prospect			2
" i will never set foot in another brick and mortar store again , " wrote a commenter using the screen name @entity46 ( who was perhaps exaggerating to make a point )			2
" their whining just cost us all a lot of money			0
let this be the nail in their coffin			0
" a lot of the objections reflected traditional political arguments			0
conservative - minded commenters looked at the bill not as a bid for fairness but as government digging into our wallets once again			1
" its criminal how they tax every dollar you make several times over , " wrote @entity0 commenter @entity70			1
" they tax your earnings , tax your spending , tax your property , special taxes , tax your utilities , tax your gas			2
... they even tax you when you die ! " added reader @entity86 : " politicians never saw a source of income they did n't want to tap			1
then they waste the money on useless projects and regulations			0
" but anti-tax arguments sometimes transcended the usual left - right battles			0
some comments reflected the " keep your hands off our @entity17 " mindset that has grown among online users who fear the impact both government and big business could have on a free and open web			2
@entity107 co-founder : i 'm not mayor of the internet the personal philosophies of billions of web users obviously run the gamut			2
but the @entity17 has always had a sort of @entity115 feel to it , and some commenters argue that is why it 's grown into the unprecedented force its become			2
" watching @entity122 debate the @entity11 , i 'm reminded of the @entity124 's fable where a man and his wife had a goose that laid golden eggs , " commenter nutemanlll wrote			2
" thinking there may be more value to what 's inside the goose than the golden eggs it laid , they killed it , only to realize the value was the golden eggs			0
" on @entity140 , @entity139 said that 's what she 's worried about			0
@entity139 runs @entity142 , an online marketplace where users buy and sell plus - sized fashions			2
" oh goody , more taxes ! " was her immediate , sarcastic reaction to a post from the @entity140 account			0
" @entity142 is a 2 - way marketplace			0
only physical retailers and government wastrels want this new tax			1
" in fairness , the bill as written would only tax sales by online businesses that do more than $ 1 million in sales annually outside states where they have physical operations			1
that would , at least in theory , exempt digital mom - and - pop shops and the random @entity166 crafter			0
but corporations with tax attorneys on speed - dial have a way of negotiating such things , as one reader pointed out			2
" all it will do is rearrange the internet businesses , " commenter 412ctruth wrote			1
" if an @entity20 business does more than 1 million in business they just have to divide their company into segments			0
say it is women 's clothing store , they just create a women 's shoe store , a women 's coat and jacket store , and a women 's clothing store , all doing less than 1 million dollars each and no taxes			0
" it pro and photographer @entity191 replied to us on @entity140 : " it wont help small businesses , it will only help large retailers			1
online and offline ; choking out small online retailers			1
" of course , even among engaged web users , disdain for the plan was n't unanimous			1
some people said that with e-commerce as prominent as it 's become , it 's only fair that states should get a cut			0
others worried about a future in which web - based sales destroy hometown operations			0
" as a small business owner ( and right - leaning individual ) i applaud this tax , " commenter imo wrote			1
" as a consumer it is not welcomed , but as a small business trying to compete with large corporations it absolutely levels the playing field			0
" owning a company with stores in 16 states means having to collect sales taxes in all of them , while major web players with operations in just one or two do n't , the commenter wrote			1
" there are many taxes that i disagree with , but this is not one of them			0
" for it to become a reality , the bill must now clear the @entity235 - controlled @entity234 and be signed by president @entity236			0
it got overwhelming support from @entity239 and @entity235 in the @entity10 , but the @entity234 , much like the @entity17 , has been known to dance to its own tune on such matters .			1
