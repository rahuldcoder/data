-- @entity3 will be fined $ 55,000 for waiting too long to provide timely warnings about a shooter on the loose during a 2007 rampage in which 32 people died , the @entity2 @entity1 said tuesday			1
the school said it will appeal			2
a december 2010 report said the school did not notify students in a " timely manner " -- as dictated by what is known as the @entity14 -- after a shooting that left two people dead at @entity18 residence hall on the morning of april 16 , 2007			2
the same shooter , identified as @entity20 , 23 , went to the university 's @entity21 more than two hours later and killed 30 more people before turning a gun on himself			2
the @entity14 was created in 1990 in memory of 19 - year - old @entity27 , who was raped and killed while asleep in her dorm room at @entity29			0
the law requires colleges and universities to disclose information about crimes on or near their campuses			0
federal officials said the $ 55,000 for two violations of the act is the maximum allowed			2
" while @entity3 's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute , the department 's fine authority is limited , " wrote @entity40 , director of a department panel that reviewed the case			1
@entity50 , associate vice president for university relations at @entity3 , said tuesday the school " respectfully disagrees " with the fine			1
" as we noted before , neither the @entity1 nor the @entity14 defines ' timely , ' " @entity54 said in a prepared statement			1
" the university actions on april 16 were well within the standards and practices in effect at that time			1
" according to the report and tuesday 's letter to @entity3 , police went to the scene of the @entity3 dorm shooting at 7:24 a.m. at 7:57 a.m. police notified the office of the executive vice president about the shooting			1
president @entity70 was then notified and an 8:25 a.m. meeting was held to discuss the shootings and how best to notify the campus community			0
the administration knew that no weapon had been found and that bloody footprints led away from the crime scene , according to the education department			0
but it was not until 9:26 a.m. that the university first notified students and staff by e-mail about the shooting			2
" the message was vague and only notified the community there had been a shooting on campus			0
it did not mention that there had been a murder or that the killer had not been identified , " the @entity1 said tuesday			1
it was about 15 minutes after the e-mail went out that @entity20 began shooting in @entity21			0
the rampage lasted from about 9:40 a.m. to 9:51 a.m. a second message was sent to the community at 9:50 a.m. with a " much more explicit warning			0
" " because @entity3 failed to notify its students and staff of the initial shootings on a timely basis , thousands continued to travel on campus , without a warning of the events at " the residence hall , the education department said			1
@entity29 officials disputed the federal findings			0
" we believe that @entity3 administrators acted appropriately in their response to the tragic events of april 16 , 2007 , based on the best information then available to them , " @entity54 said			1
the university also argued it " is being held accountable for a new federal standard that was adopted after the april 2007 shootings			2
" new rules went into effect in 2008			0
but in its letter to @entity3 , the @entity1 said the school did not meet timely warning rules that were in effect on the day of the rampage			1
the school also is being fined for not following the warning policy it had disclosed to students and staff , the department said			0
@entity0 's @entity131 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 did not send timely warnings , the federal government says
the university says it will appeal *decision*
it *claims* it met rules that were current at the time ; the @entity2 @entity1 disagrees
