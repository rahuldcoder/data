meet dr. @entity0 , the county health director for @entity1 in @entity2			1
you have now met half the medical team in @entity1			1
there are two doctors in the entire county			2
i do n't mean two doctors to treat @entity11 patients but two doctors , period			1
two doctors to take care of @entity11 patients , plus the 100 patients in their general hospital , plus the rest of the county			1
that 's two doctors for about 85,000 people			0
@entity0 does n't complain , even though he 's been working around the clock since june , when the first @entity11 case appeared in this agricultural county			1
he would , however , like an actual ebola treatment center			0
he 's been taking care of patients in a holding facility , which has only 12 beds			1
sometimes they have nearly double that number , and patients overflow onto mattresses on the floor			0
he ca n't send these patients to real @entity11 treatment centers because they 're all full			1
ebola outbreak : how to help @entity0 has been begging the federal government for more than a month for an official ebola treatment unit , one with more beds and a quarantine area for people who 've come in close contact with @entity11 patients but are n't sick			1
my team and i -- senior producer @entity46 , senior photographer @entity49 and our coordinator , @entity2 journalist @entity52 -- saw firsthand tuesday night just how much he needs a real hospital			1
about 7 p.m. , an ambulance arrived at @entity0 's facility in @entity56 with five people who , the day before , had washed the bodies of a mother and daughter who had died of @entity11			1
after they 'd done the washing , their community kicked them out , @entity0 told us			1
now the five relatives -- three adults , a 13 - year - old and a 5 - year - old -- were in the ambulance in @entity11 limbo			1
they could n't go back home , and they could n't go into the facility because they might get infected			2
complete coverage of the @entity11 outbreak by the light of a single bulb outside the facility , @entity0 convened an impromptu meeting between himself , county superintendent @entity79 and acting county field officer @entity78			1
it was decided they 'd look for a government building of some kind where the family could spend the 21 - day quarantine			0
the county health department would feed them and take care of their needs			0
but they were n't going to find a place until the morning			0
the five relatives would have to spend the night in the ambulance			0
@entity0 put in an order for a second ambulance so they could stretch out and sleep more comfortably			2
desperation grows in the @entity11 zone @entity0 and his staff are doing a heroic job of taking care of @entity11 patients under difficult circumstances			1
he 's strict about infection control -- no health care workers have died on his watch -- and he resourcefully tries different drugs to save his dying patients			2
here 's what i do n't understand : with the millions upon millions of dollars spent in @entity113 on @entity11 , why does n't this man get his treatment center ? these centers are the single most important way to prevent the transmission of the disease , since they isolate the infected			1
we left @entity56 and @entity0 and his ambulance full of @entity11 contacts and headed back to @entity122			1
i fell asleep in the car to the sounds of @entity125 on my @entity126 ( i have tween daughters )			0
just as the boys were telling me " @entity130 , " the car came to a stop , and i heard the sounds of male yelling			0
@entity2 @entity134 is beautiful and mellifluous and largely incomprehensible to me , especially when spoken at loud volume with a lot of testosterone and passion behind it			2
but i figured out this was a checkpoint , and the young men with guns wanted us to get out and wash our hands and have our temperature taken			0
@entity52 , our coordinator and an accomplished @entity2 journalist , argued with the guards			2
they did n't back down			0
they told us the president of @entity2 had been through the same checkpoint earlier in the day , and she 'd gotten out for the wash and check			2
@entity52 shot back that was fine for her , but we were n't getting out of the car			0
the screaming back and forth went on for about 20 minutes			0
we visibly and dramatically sprayed our hands inside the car with the disinfectant we had with us and leaned our heads out the window so they could check our temperature			0
no contact : life inside the @entity11 outbreak the guard aimed the thermometer at my temple ; " 36.4 , " he said , and kept staring at me			2
i had a moment of anxiety -- why was he staring ? i do n't use @entity172 every day , but i knew that was a normal temperature			0
after a few beats the guard moved on			0
i invited @entity125 back into my ears and fell asleep for the rest of the ride back to @entity122 .			0

@entity1 , @entity2 , has just two doctors
@entity0 takes care of patients in a holding facility , which has only 12 beds
he ca n't send them to real @entity11 treatment centers because they 're all full
