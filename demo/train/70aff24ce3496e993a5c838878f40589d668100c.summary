-- @entity2 coach @entity1 insisted his team can still win @entity5 's @entity4 despite their humiliating 5 - 0 defeat to arch - rivals @entity7 in the @entity8 on monday night			1
@entity1 admitted @entity2 had suffered a " much deserved loss " in the first @entity11 clash of the season , but claimed it was not a true reflection of the abilities of the two sides			1
" it was n't an embarrassment , " the 47 - year - old told a post-match press conference			0
" it 's the biggest loss of my career but it 's an easy loss to swallow because it 's a loss in a game that you have no chance of winning			2
" " [ there was ] a team that played to its maximum potential and a team that played very poorly			1
it 's a much deserved loss , but again , it was an easy loss to swallow			2
" five - star @entity7 thrash @entity2 it was @entity1 's first defeat since arriving at the @entity33 and left reigning champions @entity7 two points clear of @entity2 at the of the top of the standings			1
but with 25 matches still remaining in @entity40 season , the @entity37 is still optimistic his team can hit back			2

we have to have mental fortitude			0
" when you win important things , you have a reason to cry for joy and when someone scores five against you , you have to leave with an eagerness to play the next game			0
" @entity7 is a finished product			2
@entity2 , even though it has been playing well , is n't a finished product			2
but the result today was not indicative of the difference that exists between both teams			0

they were 2 - 0 up inside 20 minutes through goals from @entity70 and @entity71			1
