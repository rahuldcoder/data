editor 's note : @entity2 , a native of @entity3 , @entity4 , records for @entity5			1
her current album is " naked with friends			2
" singer @entity2 says one of @entity10 's favorite songs , " @entity11 , " spoke to his love of family			1
( @entity14 ) -- in 1992 , i had the pleasure of singing at the wedding of sen. @entity10 to @entity18			1
i had never met him , nor was i aware that he had even heard of me			2
to say i was surprised would be an understatement			2
he made the call himself to my home number			2
my housemate hung up on him , believing it was a hoax , but he eventually left a number for me to contact			2
when we spoke the next day , he told me how much he enjoyed my singing and named particular songs that meant a great deal to him			2
one of those songs is " @entity11 " by @entity34 , which speaks to the idea of unconditional love within a family			1
i can only assume that it had particular resonance for him			2
we discussed the song and many others that were favorites of his and , of course , i agreed to sing at the wedding			1
we spoke a few more times before the wedding and he sounded like any other man who was delighted to be marrying the woman he loved			1
i was thrilled to be involved			2
the @entity51 have been a huge part of the @entity54 psyche since i was a child			1
in many houses back then , there were pictures of the pope and @entity59			2
the fact that he was proudly @entity54 was a huge boost for our national ego at the time			2
my family had a very special photograph that was on top of our piano all my life			1
it was a picture of my father with @entity10 that was taken in the early ' 60s at the @entity75 duty free store , where my father worked at the time			1
we were all very proud of that , so when i got the call about singing at the wedding , the first person i told was my dad			1
on the day of the wedding , my musicians @entity84 and @entity85 and i were brought to @entity10 's house and escorted to the senator 's home office			1
there were so many iconic pictures on the walls it was disconcerting			0
he made time to come and visit us and was about as genial a host as i have ever encountered			1
he talked about his bride - to - be in glorious terms , shared the story of his proposal to @entity101 , and answered questions about the various pictures around the room			0
he was relaxed and happy			0
the wedding itself was beautiful			1
it was just very close family			1
there was a civil ceremony and then a blessing			0
i sang some songs during the ceremony , and then a few afterwards			0
he joined in here and there , but @entity116 bless him , he had n't a note in his head			0
he had requested that i sing the old standard " @entity120 " which i had recorded , and he and his bride danced , looking into each other 's eyes			1
he gave @entity101 a painting of daffodils he had painted as a wedding gift			1
a few days later , a framed signed print of the painting was delivered to my home			0
ever since then we kept in contact			0
they came to see me play at the @entity134 , a music hall in @entity136 , @entity137 , a few times			0
i sang at various events the senator was involved in , most recently at a fundraiser for his re-election			0
it was not a one - sided friendship though			0
a few years ago i accompanied my son to @entity146 to take part in a young leaders of @entity150 camp			0
i was a bit surprised when i found out there was to be no real interaction with any serving politician			0
on the day that we were to tour the major sites , i decided to call @entity10 's office at the @entity159 building			1
i explained to his wonderful assistant , @entity160 , what i was doing in @entity146 and asked if the senator would mind waving at the hordes from his office window			1
she called me back about 10 minutes later to say the senator had cleared some time in the afternoon , and he would speak to the group in the little park opposite the building			0
he spoke to the kids about his first time in @entity146 and how his brother @entity169 , a senator at the time , showed him around			0
he told them how inspiring it was to see how government worked and that he knew right then that he wanted to be a public servant			0
he was playful , too , and told them lots of silly stories about his dog			0
afterwards he agreed to be photographed with the group			0
i believe that many young people gathered there may have been inspired by his stories and may prove to be the next generation of humanistic @entity183			0
he loved to serve , but most of all he dearly loved his wife and family			1
i will miss him , too -- even his singing			0
