-- the young women in a @entity3 classroom are learning how to deal with a difficult birth			2
as instructors watch over and guide the simulation , the girls gently tug at a baby doll as it passes through the model of a birth canal			0
these students , all in their third semester at the @entity13 , will soon join the growing number of midwives in a country where being a mother is ranked among the worst in the world			1
women in @entity20 are 70 times more likely to die in childbirth than from a bullet or a bomb , according to @entity24			1
it 's a grim statistic the women here are trying to change			1
" my father encouraged me to do this because when he was 10 , he lost his mother when she was giving birth to another child , " says @entity28 , who , like the rest of her classmates , hopes to make @entity20 a better , safer place for mothers and their babies			1
@entity28 says she wants women in far - flung provinces to have access to good medical facilities , doctors and midwives			1
to that end , she says she plans to go and work in @entity46 once she 's certified			0
in 2003 , there were only about 500 midwives in @entity20			1
today , there are some 3,000			0
but many more are needed			0
" increasing the numbers of midwives , particularly midwives that live and work within communities and rural communities that might not have access to other health services is an extremely important factor in reducing maternal mortality , " says @entity51 of @entity24			2
still , less than two - thirds of @entity20 women have access to nearby health facilities			1
" many , many mothers and children will never see a trained health worker , a doctor , a nurse or a midwife in their lifetime , " @entity51 says , " and that really needs to be improved and turned around			1
" it 's one of the reasons why groups such as @entity24 , along with other nongovernmental organizations and foreign donors , are funding programs in conjunction with the country 's @entity80 to improve the chances of mothers ' and children 's welfare and survival			2
a mother bravely campaigns for president one pilot program in @entity90 teaches volunteers how to become community health workers			0
many of the women being trained have lost mothers , sisters and cousins to pregnancy - related complications			1
many have also buried their babies			0
they decided it was time to change things			0
the women are illiterate , so they learn from pictograms			2
" it 's good work , " says @entity105 , a mother of six			0
" in my village , maternal mortality has gone down 100 % in the last two years			0
" @entity105 's village may be an exception , but most women there now give birth in the presence of qualified health workers			2
still , sustaining and spreading initiatives such as this one will take even more investment from the international community			0
and while @entity121 point to a certain success in the reduction of mother and child mortality rates in recent years , the situation in @entity20 remains dire -- here , a woman dies from pregnancy - related causes every two hours			1
that statistic is just one that illustrates the fragile state of women in @entity20 more than a decade since @entity133 forces ousted @entity135 rule			1
speaking out against rape tortured teen : ' same should be done to them ' back in the @entity3 classroom , the midwives in training stay focused			2
" their main goal should be serving mothers and decreasing the rate of maternal mortality , " says @entity142 , a midwife instructor			0
it 's a noble goal , but one that could be in jeopardy , women and aid workers say they fear , if foreign funding falls off once coalition troops withdraw .			0
