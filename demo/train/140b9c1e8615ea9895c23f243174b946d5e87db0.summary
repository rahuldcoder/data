-- @entity2 energy production is skyrocketing , and pundits are promising everything from millions of jobs to energy independence			1
all of this could be put in jeopardy , though , if we do n't get serious about the accompanying risks and make sure that oil and gas development is done right			2
the @entity2 is now the world 's largest producer of natural gas			1
meanwhile @entity2 oil production increased last year by over 300 million barrels -- its biggest jump since the industry began in 1859			1
there 's good reason to believe that these changes have created hundreds of thousands of jobs			0
meanwhile increased production of cleaner burning natural gas has helped cut @entity2 greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest level in more than a decade			1
and while claims of looming " energy independence " are wildly over the top , there 's no question that the oil and gas boom is making the country more secure in the world			1
these changes are driven by a technique known as " fracking , " short for hydraulic fracturing , which is being used to produce oil and gas trapped in dense shale rock			1
photos : taking from the land : oiling on @entity46 reservations drillers dig down thousands of feet underground , take a sharp turn , and then bore thousands of feet further sideways			0
then they pump a mix of water , sand , and chemicals into the new l - shaped well , and detonate explosives to create tiny cracks in the surrounding shale			0
oil and gas flows through those cracks and eventually up to the surface where it can be collected , shipped , and sold			2
the practice has raised alarm in many of the communities where it 's used			0
people fear that their water will be contaminated by the chemicals that are used in fracking			2
they worry about earthquakes that have been reported near some places where disposal of water from fracking occurs			2
and they often bristle at how a sudden surge of workers and wealth transforms their neighborhoods overnight			0
these concerns have led to a moratorium on fracking in @entity84 , and efforts to pass similar restrictions by state and local governments elsewhere , from @entity89 to @entity90			2
people are right to insist that fracking is done safely , but they 're wrong if they conclude that it ca n't be			1
the key is to drill down on the biggest problems and require drillers to address them			0
the first risk has to do with water			0
the problem is n't so much what 's pumped underground -- it 's borderline impossible for fracking chemicals to seep up from thousands of feet beneath the earth and into water supplies -- but what comes back out			2
opinion : the myth of energy independence when oil and gas are produced , they 're accompanied by " flowback water " , which contains a mix of toxic chemicals found underground			1
if drillers cut corners and do n't dispose of that water right , it can contaminate local water supplies			0
rules need to be in place -- and enforced aggressively -- to ensure that does n't happen			1
the second danger has to do with air			0
some drillers power their operations using diesel ; others let gas seep out from their equipment			2
both practices lead to local air pollution			0
and while the emissions from a single well might not be big , the impact of dozens of wells operating in the same area can be bad			0
these problems can be fixed -- diesel generators can be replaced with equipment that uses clean - burning gas , and leaks can be plugged -- but the rules need to be right			1
perhaps the toughest challenge , though , is fitting fracking into communities that are n't used to intense industrial development			2
it 's no surprise that concerns about fracking began to really rise in 2009 , when the practice migrated from states like @entity90 and @entity153 , where oil and gas development is commonplace , to @entity155 , where oil production peaked in 1891			1
if local authorities do things like make sure roads are maintained , help workers get training so that they can join the oil and gas business if they want to , and protect people on pensions who often struggle with rising living costs in boom towns , everyone can win			1
if they do n't , though , the intense fights that result between winners and losers from energy production can be paralyzing			1
opinion : do n't let @entity2 get ' fracked ' a lot of enthusiasts for oil and gas are hostile to new rules			1
they say that companies are already doing the right thing and warn that extra costs could kill the industry			0
it 's true that many companies are ahead of the curve when it comes to social and environmental responsibility ; some are even working actively with local and environmental groups to ensure that they pursue development right			0
but the dangers do n't come from the good guys -- they come from the laggards who screw things up			0
reining them in ca n't be done just through voluntary steps			0
that makes it a relief that , while dumb regulation could indeed be crushing , smart rules would not			0
( by one estimate , a suite of twenty - two tough requirements , including greater disclosure of fracking fluids and tighter standards for cementing wells , would add at most 7 % to the cost of a well			0
) the biggest risk for fracking , and to all the benefits it brings , is n't that drillers will have to spend a bit more to make sure that oil and gas production proceeds safely			1
it 's that they wo n't -- and that the resulting backlash when things inevitably go wrong will deal the @entity2 power surge a far more severe blow			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity2 energy production has surged , largely *due* to fracking for natural gas
@entity228 says energy boom increases @entity2 security , boosts the economy
fracking can be done safely , but rules must be in place to regulate it , he says
