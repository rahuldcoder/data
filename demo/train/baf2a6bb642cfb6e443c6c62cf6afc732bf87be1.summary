late last month , the @entity0 voted to approve the siting of the @entity4 pipeline by a vote of 62 - 36			1
this vote will ultimately have little impact on the project 's future as president @entity10 has promised to veto the legislation			1
nevertheless , the process by which the @entity0 considered this highly partisan issue was truly remarkable			1
over three weeks , the @entity0 debated and voted on 41 amendments -- nearly three times as many amendments as were considered during all of 2014			1
moreover , the process was cordial , occasionally intense and at times even suspenseful			1
while covering a wide variety of topics , the amendments were all substantive and reasonably related to the topic of the proposed legislation			1
votes were taken on delaying the effective date of the pipeline ; requiring campaign finance disclosures for those benefiting from tar sands development ; and removing the lesser prairie chicken from the threatened species list			0
several amendments were adopted including bipartisan legislation to accelerate energy efficiency and a widely supported resolution acknowledging that climate change is real and not a hoax			2
given the authentic opportunity to debate , @entity37 responded in kind , agreeing to a fixed number of amendments and a endorsing a process for final consideration of the legislation			1
this blast of engagement is not a testament to the exceptional or unique significance of the @entity4 debate			1
it is also not a coincidence			0
majority leader @entity52 has committed to restoring the @entity0 's deliberative process even if it means spending more time in @entity54 and subjecting his caucus to the occasional " tough vote			1
" the @entity0 's ability to conduct this productive process while considering a hotly contested and highly partisan issue is an early sign that both @entity61 and @entity37 are up to the challenge			1
the more open debate created an obligation and opportunity for @entity67 chair @entity66 , @entity68 , to work closely with the committee 's ranking member , sen. @entity69 , @entity71			2
energy policy is often a topic that can generate bipartisan support , and this early legislative activity is promising , even if the debate was partisan and at times even harsh			0
more fundamentally , that the full @entity0 spent long hours together in the chamber is a breakthrough			1
the process may be laborious , but it 's the essence of our democracy			2
to appreciate the ramifications of a return to active deliberation , it is necessary to understand the dynamics at the heart of congressional gridlock			2
the usual diagnosis of our government 's recent dysfunction is that toxic polarization and anger are preventing deliberation			2
but the reverse is equally true : the absence of deliberation has also caused exasperation , enmity and toxic polarization			2
in the six years that former @entity37 sen. @entity104 of @entity68 served in the @entity0 , he did not have a single amendment considered on the @entity0 floor -- not one			1
imagine a pilot who is never allowed to fly a plane or a surgeon barred from the operating room and you 'll get a sense of the exasperation felt by those serving in a dysfunctional democracy			0
centrist democrat @entity117 lamented last year that his worst day as governor of @entity119 was better than his best day as a @entity121 senator			0
and yet another senator grudgingly described his job to me as that of a " glorified telemarketer who occasionally gets to vote to confirm an assistant secretary of education			0
" this boiling resentment must be channeled somewhere , and much of it follows the path of least resistance -- feeding the foul mood and partisan rancor that undermines collaboration			0
even when the vast majority of amendments are defeated , the very act of being heard serves as a safety valve , releasing some of the steam and reducing the likelihood that issues blow up			0
moreover , the ability to debate amendments provides an incentive for building coalitions			0
why take on the political risk of pushing an idea that is at odds with leadership or orthodoxy if you 'll never even be heard ? an additional reason @entity154 may be opening up the process is that the political strategy of avoiding tough votes was , thankfully , a big flop in the 2014 elections			2
all of the seven purple state democrats that sen. @entity161 sought to protect lost their seats			0
in each contest , these democrats were aggressively challenged for voting in lockstep with the president 's agenda			0
given the opportunity to take some " tough votes , " they might have been able to demonstrate independence and courage			0
looking to the future , the real question is whether @entity154 can sustain his promise in light of the time commitment and occasional " gotcha " amendments that go along with open debate			0
there have been few opportunities of late to extol @entity121 democracy			0
let 's hope our leaders seize and build upon this opportunity to restore the wisdom and character of the @entity0 .			1

@entity192 : @entity4 legislation is likely to be vetoed , but process was *encouraging*
he says the @entity0 is returning to its *tradition* of more open deliberation
