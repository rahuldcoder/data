@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 owed his bosses $ 300,000 , and he was running out of time			1
one anti-drug operation in @entity0 netted $ 10.6 million , 108 kilos of cocaine , 17 pounds of meth and 32 weapons			1
gunmen snatched @entity3 and locked him in the basement of a home to try to settle the drug debt			0
he was chained to a wall of the basement by his hands and ankles , gagged and beaten			0
his captors , members of a powerful @entity20 drug cartel , held @entity3 for ransom , chained in the sweltering , dirty basement for six days without food			0
@entity3 's ordeal could 've been a scene from the drug war in @entity20			0
but it played out recently in suburban @entity0 , @entity1			2
@entity31 federal agents are fighting to keep that kind of violence from gripping @entity0 , as the city known for @entity35 and @entity36 has become a major distribution hub for @entity20 drug cartels			1
in fiscal year 2008 , authorities confiscated about $ 70 million in drug - related cash in @entity0 , more than anywhere else in the @entity31 , the @entity39 says			1
this fiscal year , @entity0 continues to outpace all other @entity31 regions in such seizures , with $ 30 million confiscated so far			1
next are @entity45 , @entity46 , with about $ 19 million , and @entity47 , @entity48 , with $ 18 million			2
" there is definitely a center of this type of drug activity here , and we are working to make sure the violence does not spill out to the general public , " @entity0 @entity31 attorney @entity49 said			1
@entity0 has become a stopping point for truckloads of @entity20 cocaine , heroin , marijuana and methamphetamine , agents say			2
the drugs are held in stash houses before being distributed up the @entity67			0
" the money comes down here also to money managers in @entity0 , who get the books in order before it is sent out , " said @entity68 , @entity0 's chief of the @entity39			2
agents attribute the growth in drug trafficking to @entity0 's location , proximity to other major cities and access to major highways			1
authorities also point to the growth of the @entity85 population in @entity0 , which allows practitioners of the @entity20 drug trade to blend in among hard - working , law - abiding @entity88			1
no place is that more evident than in @entity90 , a community about 20 miles north of @entity0			1
@entity90 's @entity85 population rocketed from 8,470 in 1990 to 63,727 in 2000 , according to the @entity93			2
by 2010 , 20 percent of the county 's projected population of 700,000 is expected to be @entity85			0
" in @entity90 , the drug dealers are able to hide in plain sight , " county district attorney @entity96 said			1
" to combat this , we have to be much more coordinated between my office , the police department and the federal authorities			0
the presence of the organizations is a dilemma enough that we have to develop new tactics			0
" federal agents say arrests and drug - related violence in @entity0 have been linked to the two most powerful @entity20 organizations : the @entity113 and @entity114 cartels			1
a battle over drug routes has been blamed for the recent surge in violence in @entity20 border towns , bloodshed that has included hundreds of deaths			0
the fear is that the battle will extend deeper into the @entity31 , causing more to suffer a fate similar to @entity3 's ordeal in the @entity90 basement			1
lucky for @entity3 , federal agents had a wiretap on his captors ' phones			0
agents stormed the home just as it appeared that the debt would not be paid and @entity3 would be killed			0
" there is no doubt in my mind that we saved his life that day , " said the @entity39 's @entity68			0
one case resolved , as cartels thrive in @entity0 .			2
