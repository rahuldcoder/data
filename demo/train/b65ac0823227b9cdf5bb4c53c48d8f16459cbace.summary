-- president @entity1 is getting a lot of free advice			1
here 's a question , not an answer : with every issue in the @entity9 intertwined with every other , like a giant bowl of spaghetti , where do you begin ? in reality , no matter where you begin in the @entity9 , each strand connects to almost every other : @entity15 ? immediately you must think of the @entity16 who are harboring refugees and fighters just across the border , and @entity20 , who are beginning to harbor thoughts of autonomy and are increasing contacts with their ethnic brothers in @entity25 and @entity16			1
@entity27 , of course , is aiding the beleaguered @entity28 but also trying to organize an exit strategy ; @entity30 and @entity31 are pouring money and arms into the country with the sole purpose of cracking the @entity15 - @entity27 entente ; @entity25 fears that a @entity38 takeover in @entity15 will revitalize its own restless @entity38			1
the @entity40 issue ? no need to elaborate			1
that is tangled up with everything in the @entity9			1
the @entity45 awakening ? the policies you adopt with the emerging @entity49 governments will affect every strand you touch in the region , from relations with @entity53 to the @entity45 states in the @entity55 that are terrified of sweeping change			1
the president will not have the luxury of choosing a single issue and ignoring or postponing all the others			0
the whole @entity9 has a habit of intruding , and policy choices will have to be made about each of the major issues , even if it is not convenient			1
still , in plotting a second term , the president must establish some priorities			0
trying to do everything at once is not only bad strategy , it is a certain recipe for failure across the board			0
a point of entry : possibly the most promising strand to pull when trying to unravel the @entity9 problem is the @entity27 dilemma			1
when @entity1 came into office four years ago , he courageously promised to engage @entity27 leaders			1
he made a genuine attempt , but he quickly pulled back in the face of @entity27 's brutal suppression of a civil uprising , @entity53 demands for an early deadline on the nuclear issue and the fact that he had a lot on his domestic plate			1
@entity93 evocatively describes that episode in the book " a @entity96			0
" there was no staying power			0
instead , the @entity99 reverted to its default position of sanctions while maintaining the framework for serious negotiations with @entity27 as part of the so - called @entity105 -- the five permanent members of the @entity107 ( the @entity99 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 ) plus one ( @entity112 )			1
the sanctions did their job			0
@entity27 has gladly accepted the invitation of the @entity105 to return to the negotiating table			1
however , in the run - up to the presidential election , the @entity99 was unwilling to put a meaningful offer on the table , and the negotiating track languished in a kind of limbo			0
the value of sanctions : sanctions have two useful purposes			0
one is to persuade @entity27 to return to the negotiating table			1
the other is to give the sanctioning party something to bargain away in return for concessions			0
up to this point , the @entity99 has been unwilling to offer significant sanctions relief in return for significant concessions from @entity27			2
sanctions have assumed a life of their own and are gradually becoming politically untouchable			2
if that remains true , then there is no prospect of serious negotiations			0
there is another use of sanctions -- to punish a party you do n't like and potentially coerce them into submission or collapse			0
the current sanctions regime is taking on that coloration , even if it is seldom discussed as such			0
the record of sanctions in producing abject surrender or regime change is not promising			0
instead , the sanctions typically hurt the average citizen , while leaders escape most of the effects and adopt a defiant posture , blaming their own failings on outside interference			0
this is beginning to happen in @entity27 today			2
vicious assaults on the well - being of a country 's population can produce popular bitterness and hostility against the " enemy " that can last for generations			2
the shape of an agenda : as with many long - standing disputes , the broad outlines of a settlement are well - known to the parties			0
what is lacking is the political judgment by both sides that now is the moment to proceed with a deal that will require mutual compromise			2
the @entity99 and its allies will have to accept a measure of @entity27 domestic enrichment of uranium			2
@entity27 will have to accept limits on its entire nuclear infrastructure , subject to intrusive inspections and monitoring			1
@entity27 will need to document the history of its nuclear program , and the @entity194 will need to remove sanctions			1
all of this must happen in a step - by - step process with safeguards and verifications at each stage			0
there is nothing easy about it			0
the @entity27 are known as obstinate and often infuriating negotiators			2
the @entity99 is not known for its patience , and it can be clumsy and ponderous as it attempts to please multiple constituencies at the same time			0
@entity27 is certain to face strong objections from its hardliners , and the same will apply in the @entity99			2
the hardliners on both sides , who regard another @entity9 war as an acceptable option , reinforce each other and impede efforts to find mutually acceptable compromises			1
@entity53 and the @entity216 will try to impose impractically tight deadlines			2
and events in the region , such as the recent case of @entity27 aircraft firing on a @entity99 surveillance drone , can sabotage negotiations			1
the @entity45 states of the @entity55 will be intensely suspicious of any hint of a secret deal between the @entity99 and @entity27			1
they remember @entity99 's strategic reliance on the shah , the @entity232 administration 's covert sale of weapons to @entity27 in the mid- 1980s and @entity99 's installation of a @entity236 government in @entity25			1
they ( and @entity53 ) will have to be persuaded that any accommodation with @entity27 is not at their expense			1
private and public negotiations : the starting point must be private @entity99 - @entity27 discussions , leading to an agreed agenda			2
both sides have recently hinted that such talks are under consideration , and reactions from the @entity250 , @entity111 and even the @entity99 people have been undismayed , even openly supportive			0
the choice of representatives and venues is less important than confidence that delegates credibly reflect the view of their leaders			0
experience suggests that an agreed agenda is more likely to emerge from bilateral discussions outside the glare of publicity			0
if that is accomplished , then the actual negotiations could be carried out within the existing @entity105 framework			0
even a preliminary agreement -- establishing a mutually acceptable process with a defined end point -- would help to unravel some of the tangles of @entity9 issues			1
the threat of a new war in the @entity9 would be reduced			1
the possibility of getting @entity27 cooperation on @entity15 would be improved			1
the threat of nuclear proliferation in the region would be tamped down at least temporarily			1
and the multiple flash points in the @entity55 could potentially cool down , leaving opportunities for more constructive initiatives			0
the history of @entity99 - @entity27 relations is a story of relentless hostility and serial missed opportunities			2
chances for genuine progress come along scarcely once in a decade			0
so , mr. president , here is one more piece of free advice : the present constellation of circumstances with @entity27 is probably the best you 're going to get			2
do n't let it pass			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity300 .			2

@entity300 : @entity9 issues are all bound up together , *impossible* to *disentangle*
@entity15 , @entity27 , @entity53 , the @entity40 , @entity30 : all are intertwined politically
@entity1 's first step must be to deal with @entity27 , he says , accepting compromise essential
sick : @entity27 deal would cut threat of war , help in @entity15 , lesson risk of nuclear proliferation in region
