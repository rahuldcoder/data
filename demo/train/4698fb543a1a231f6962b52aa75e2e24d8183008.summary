" those are two words that @entity2 and @entity3 say perfectly describe their families ' reaction to their unique wedding plans			1
instead of having a typical ceremony , complete with cake and family photos , the couple chose a different path : to celebrate their love by sharing good deeds across the country with people they 'd never met			2
for past two years , the newlyweds have been spending their wedding budget to perform one act of kindness in each of the 50 states			1
the @entity24 plan to complete their mission this spring			0
the @entity27 - based couple met as students , while attending @entity29			1
they say it was their mutual love of volunteerism and community activism that drew them together			0
" it just clicked , " says @entity35			0
" we both had this passion within us			0
" while in the midst of selecting a venue for a more traditional wedding ceremony , they had a change of heart			1
" we were actually planning a big wedding reception and honeymoon , " @entity3 says			1
" we realized that our way of celebrating our love would be different , and we came up with 50 acts of giving back			1
" for @entity3 , the idea of sharing goodwill in place of a wedding also became a special way to honor the legacy of her father , a civil engineer and philanthropist who taught her the importance of making a difference			1
" the father of the bride plays important role on the wedding day , and i realized my father would n't be there			2
" @entity3 says her father suddenly passed away from heart attack while hosting a charity event that gave college scholarships to underserved youth			1
at that event , @entity3 's father delivered his last speech -- focusing on the importance of love and the importance of giving back			1
so , @entity2 and @entity3 ditched the idea of a formal wedding			1
no flower bouquet was tossed			0
no speeches were made , and no family pictures taken			0
the @entity27 couple quietly exchanged vows at a courthouse			1
they named their mission , " @entity92 " and took to @entity88 and @entity89 for suggestions of where to go			2
soon the couple was overwhelmed with responses			2
they say each stated visited was the result of an online discussion			2
after sharing their idea on social media , their friends and followers echoed the message through @entity88 shares and retweets			1
using the hashtag # @entity107 , the @entity106 say they were contacted by people across the country in need of their support			0
what started as a way to honor the legacy of @entity3 's father became an online campaign to promote the couple 's first love : volunteerism			1
" social media , whether it 's a post or a tweet , can impact your world , " @entity2 says			1
" it may seem small , but it can go a long way			0
" after hearing of their initiative , @entity2 and @entity3 say others were so inspired by their story , people began to donate to their cause			1
the couple continued to self - fund " @entity92 " but used the monetary donations to start a nonprofit , @entity135			2
this way they would be able to continue their charitable work once their 50 state journey was completed			2
after selecting a location with the help of their online friends , the @entity24 rented a car and drove to each state			1
although challenging , it became the @entity106 best way to travel as they soon learned they were expecting their first child ! after their daughter @entity152 was born , the couple hit the road again with her in the backseat			2
" she became a part of this journey			0
she was always with us , " @entity3 says			2
the baby became like the little mascot			0
" in @entity162 , @entity163 , they brought flowers and presents to patients suffering from cancer			0
in @entity168 , @entity169 they assisted elderly men and women with grocery shopping			0
in @entity174 , the couple participated in an adaptive sports camp for children with disabilities			0
at the conclusion of the camp , the couple says they presented gifts to the children			0
" because of all the support received from all over the @entity185 , we realized this journey is much bigger than a wedding , " @entity3 says			1
although rewarding , the couple admits there were challenges			0
in addition to handling the daily tasks of having a newborn , @entity2 and @entity3 balanced worked schedules as well			1
working in a family business allowed them the flexibility to travel , but they say coordination was key			0
" some states you literally have to drive seven hours just to get to the next area , " @entity2 commented			1
" it 's definitely something you have to be mentally prepared for			0
" the couple 's next move ? the @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209			0
they hope to wrap up their journey by spring of 2015			0
" we believe in a chain reaction of kindness , " @entity3 says			2
