it 's a heartwarming , epic journey through defining events of the late 20th century , as seen through the eyes of a dim - witted but honorable hero whose life is a testament to small - town @entity6 values			1
it 's an overrated , manipulative tearjerker that glosses over a turbulent period of @entity6 history and suggests a simpleton can become a successful businessman , husband and father merely by chance			1
with " @entity17 , " which hit theaters 20 years ago this weekend , there 's not much middle ground			1
the movie won the best picture @entity23 , earned $ 677 million around the world and is hailed by many as a modern classic , filled with homespun catchphrases like , " my momma always said life was like a box of chocolates			0
you never know what you 're gon na get			0
" but many critics -- and some moviegoers -- hated it			1
to them , " @entity17 " was a simpleminded mix of gooey sentiment and ridiculous flights of fancy			1
( @entity17 suddenly decides to jog back and forth across the country ? for three years ? seriously ? ) " @entity47 ' ode to 20th century @entity6 still represents one of cinema 's most clearly drawn lines in the sand , " said @entity43 a decade after the movie 's release			1
" one - half of folks see it as an artificial piece of pop melodrama , while everyone else raves that it 's sweet as a box of chocolates			0
" twenty years later , the movie remains a cultural touchstone -- and surprisingly polarizing			1
while some other best picture winners from the ' 90s ( " @entity65 " ) have faded from memory , it 's hard to find someone even now who does n't have an opinion about " @entity17			1
" " i think the movie can be read in several different ways , " said @entity70 , a professor of history at @entity72 who has co-authored academic papers about the movie 's influence			0
" it can be read as a celebration of @entity6 goodness and innocence			1
and it can also be read as a kind of critique of @entity6 naivete and innocence			1
" here 's a closer look at some of the arguments around " @entity17 , " both pro and con			1
it 's a celebration of conservative values @entity17 , as played by @entity94 , is the epitome of wholesome decency : a @entity98 - fearing , all - american football player and war hero who has no use for the counterculture movements of the late ' 60s			1
despite an iq of 75 , he achieves fame and financial success			0
he 's even from red - state @entity105 ! meanwhile @entity17 's childhood sweetheart , @entity108 , becomes a promiscuous hippie , joins the anti-war movement , hangs out with the @entity111 , gets strung out on cocaine , ponders suicide and eventually -- if you need a spoiler alert here , we feel sorry for you -- dies of an unspecified disease			1
no wonder many political conservatives embraced the movie			1
in 2009 the @entity122 ranked it no. 4 on its list of the 25 best conservative films of the past 25 years			0
" it seems the film promotes a very conventional conservative political position , " said @entity126 , a professor of media culture at the @entity128			0
" while both @entity17 and @entity133 experience many of the most notable historical events of the era , @entity133 's anti-conformist lifestyle is made to look very unappealing			2
it panders to audiences between @entity139 's swelling score and @entity94 ' somber voice - overs -- especially at the deaths of three major characters -- " @entity17 " wears its emotions on the surface			1
for many viewers , this worked -- especially during the tear - jerking final scene at @entity133 's grave -- but others complained the movie went for cheap sentiment by suggesting to moviegoers how they should feel at each moment			0
" this movie is so insistently heartwarming that it chilled me to the marrow , " wrote @entity154 in @entity155			0
" there are no moral crosswinds here , not a breath of doubt or unease to ruffle the @entity17 image			2
" some critics griped the movie had no nuance , no subtlety , no shades of gray to muddy its simplistic view of the world			2
" it is incredibly manipulative ... in what i would say is the most dangerous way , which is manipulation through a sleight - of - hand superficial liberalism ; it hides its political conservatism in a good - ole - boy story about a protagonist whose very heroism is totally unconscious , unaware , " said @entity172 , a professor of film theory at the @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity128			0
" it is a funny film , a sweet film , and an entertaining film , " he added			0
" but it is a deceptive film , a manipulative film , and ( like most best picture winners ) a conservative film			0
" it offers young viewers a valuable history lesson " @entity17 " spans some 30 years and touches on many important chapters in @entity6 history , including the @entity198 , the ' 60s anti-war movement and the @entity200			1
along the way @entity17 encounters a young @entity202 and three @entity6 presidents and even appears to inspire @entity204 's " imagine " when he meets the ex-beatle on a talk show			1
some teachers have shown the movie in high school classrooms as a jumping - off point for discussing the ' 60s and ' 70s			0
no , it airbrushes history " the film ... simplifies historical events that were incredibly tumultuous and complex , " said the @entity128 's @entity126			0
by presenting history through the experiences of the slow - witted @entity17 , the movie " situates history as something to be felt , emotionally , at the expense of intellectual consideration			1
" @entity222 , of @entity72 , surveyed students about the movie and found that they remembered iconic moments , such as the scene where @entity17 accidentally addresses an anti-war protest in @entity228 and reunites with @entity133			1
but the students did n't remember how @entity17 got there , or understand the scene 's historical undercurrent -- that disillusioned @entity198 veterans were instrumental in turning public opinion against the war			2
hey , lighten up ! it 's just a fable many believe " @entity17 , " adapted liberally from @entity238 's novel , is not meant to be taken literally			2
some viewers see @entity17 as a @entity241 - like figure , especially in the scenes when he 's trotting across the country , long - haired and bearded , with a herd of followers behind him			2
even its floating feather , which opens the film , can be seen as a metaphor for the randomness of fate and the direction of one 's life			0
it was a pioneer in visual effects " @entity17 " received kudos for its unobtrusive and @entity23 - winning digital effects that made @entity260 's lt. @entity259 look like he had no legs and turned a few thousand extras at the @entity263 into half a million war protesters			2
the filmmakers also inserted @entity94 seamlessly into archival footage of presidents @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 , providing some of the movie 's funniest moments			0
ok , but it 's no ' @entity274 ' although " @entity17 " beat " @entity274 " for the 1994 best picture @entity23 , many film scholars rate @entity278 's film -- with its vivid antiheroes , nonlinear plot and pungent dialogue -- as the better movie			1
" @entity274 " and its gallery of colorful criminals did n't stand a chance of winning top honors at the @entity23 that year			0
but @entity278 's brash movie inspired countless imitators			0
if you ask a film critic to list the most influential movies of the 1990s , you probably wo n't hear them mention " @entity17			1
" who cares ? it 's a classic " @entity17 " blends drama , comedy , reality and fantasy into a genre - busting saga that almost defies description			2
it should n't work , but it does			0
its scenes , and lines , are indelible to many of us : " run , @entity17 , run ! " " i got ta pee			2
" " @entity307 is as stupid does			0
" " that boy sure is a runnin ' fool ! " " i 'm sorry i had to fight in the middle of your @entity111			0
" " there 's pineapple shrimp , lemon shrimp , coconut shrimp , pepper shrimp ... " the list , and " @entity17 's " legacy , goes on and on			2
and that 's all we have to say about that .			0
