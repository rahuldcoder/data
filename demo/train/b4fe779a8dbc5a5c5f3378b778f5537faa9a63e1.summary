-- picture a field full of heavy - set men sporting shaved heads and covered with tattoos			0
they pump their fists in the air and dance raucously in front of a stage festooned with @entity11 flags and racist skinhead symbols			1
others , including a few women , watch around the perimeter			0
onstage , people are playing deafening music , shouting more than singing , with lyrics urging white people " to stand up and fight			2
" without the racism element , this might just be another concert			0
but this is music with a message -- a white power music concert			1
every year , versions of this scene play out across the @entity27 , if not in a field , perhaps in an old warehouse or , more rarely , an actual music club			0
some white supremacists drive for hundreds of miles to attend			2
others purchase or download white power music from the @entity34			1
since white power music arrived in the @entity27 in the late 1970s , it has become a pillar of the subculture permeating the white supremacist movement			1
white supremacist groups strong it is in this subculture that @entity42 , the white supremacist responsible for the massacre earlier this week at a @entity45 temple in @entity46 , moved , made friends , and fully immersed himself			1
page , 41 , was a white supremacist skinhead who played in two white power music bands , @entity50 and @entity51 , affiliated with the @entity52			1
the @entity52 are a longstanding hardcore racist skinhead group with a history of violence and hate crimes			0
page was a member , identifying himself as a @entity59 , part of the group 's upper @entity62 branch			0
white power music is a small music scene , not comparable to any mainstream music genre			1
the largest concerts wo n't attract more than 300 people ; most organizers would be happy to see half that number			1
music , military marked @entity45 temple gunman 's path at any given time , about 100 to 150 white power bands are in the @entity27			1
the bands ' own names defiantly express feelings of hate or violence : @entity80 , @entity81 , attack , @entity51 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , among others			0
most of these bands are the white supremacist equivalents of garage bandsâ € ” nobody is getting rich from this music			1
behind them are small record labels or distributors that specialize in white power music : label 56 , @entity99 , @entity100 , and others			1
many bands are associated with a racist skinhead group such as @entity104 , the @entity105 or , especially , the @entity52			0
the @entity52 dominate much of the white power music scene			1
many bands are @entity52 - affiliated , while the group itself organizes hate music concerts , including @entity111 , its largest annual event			1
@entity114 killings put spotlight on hate rock the music comes in many flavors			2
the oldest is a racist form of @entity120 ! , associated with the original skinhead subculture in @entity122			0
also popular is hatecore , a white supremacist version of hardcore punk			2
a white supremacist form of death metal music , known as @entity128 or @entity129 , has become popular			2
there are other small subgenres of hate music ; even a few white power hip hop artists , though most white supremacists dislike hip hop			1
white power music conveys many messages			1
obviously , it conveys hatred : antagonism toward @entity141 , immigrants , nonwhites , @entity144 , gays and left - wingers			0
but songs can convey other messages , too			0
some white power songs may glorify heroes or martyrs of the white supremacist movement			1
some are essentially self - promotional , praising a group or leader			0
songs that urge or celebrate generic violence are also common , emerging from a subculture in which violence is easily condoned			0
a number of songs attempt to convey some sense of commonality , to strengthen the sense that listeners are in a movement with shared ideas , goals -- or enemies			0
what are the effects of white power music ? it 's often hard to know exactly how music of any kind may affect someone			1
music is universally acknowledged as powerful , yet its effects are often indirect			0
hate music does sometimes create direct effects			2
incidents of hate crimes being committed by people who had just been at a hate music event have been reported			2
more indirectly , hate music certainly contributes to the shared ideas and notions of the white supremacist movement , including its willing acceptance of violence			1
but there is a " chicken and egg " question , too			0
it is almost certainly the case that , for many white supremacists , the music does n't motivate them to violence so much as reflect attitudes about hate and violence they already possess			1
does the music motivate them to be hateful , or does the fact that they are hateful cause them to appreciate the music ? for each individual , there 's probably a different answer			0
white power music is often cited as a recruiting tool for white supremacists			1
this is certainly true to some degree , although most of their recruitment tends to be passive rather than active			0
organized attempts are made from time to time by white supremacist groups to use white power music to attract young people , but none of these attempts has truly been successful			1
of more importance is simply the existence of hate music			2
a certain number of people will like the music or the message , or both , and some may be drawn into the movement itself			2
the @entity34 has allowed more people to encounter this music than previously			0
what can be done about this music and the violence it seems to beget ? one solution is to shine the light of day on the hateful lyrics and subculture , so that more people will speak out and reject their disturbing and sometimes violent message			2
this is part of the work we at the @entity249 do every day			0
a previous version of this commentary incorrectly included the band @entity252 in a list of white power bands			2
@entity252 is a self - described " hardcore metal " band			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			0

@entity261 : tattooed men pump fists in front of @entity11 flags at white power music concerts
@entity261 : this music a part of white supremacist movement subculture since 1970s
for supremacists , the music reflects attitudes toward hate they already have , he says
concerts do n't attract a lot of people , he says , attempts to recruit are not truly successful
