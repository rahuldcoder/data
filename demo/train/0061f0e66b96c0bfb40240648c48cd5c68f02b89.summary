-- @entity1 's week went from bad to worse saturday			1
three days after it was ousted by @entity2 in the @entity4 quarterfinals , @entity1 lost 1 - 0 at lowly @entity5 in @entity7 's @entity6 to give @entity2 's second club a huge boost in the title race			1
@entity2 can move four points clear of @entity1 on sunday , a lead that would render the teams ' clash on the final day of the season meaningless -- if @entity16 is out of contention			1
@entity16 replaced @entity1 in second by defeating @entity19 4 - 0 at home later saturday but was still without the injured @entity21			1
@entity16 has 79 points to match @entity2 , though trails through head - to - head record and has played a game more			2
a combination of inspired goalkeeping by backup @entity28 and @entity1 misses -- from the likes of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 -- ensured a night of frustration for @entity35 's men , who must pick themselves up in time for wednesday 's @entity37 final against @entity16			1
a headline on @entity1 's website saturday proclaimed , ' the ball did n't want to go in			0
' @entity1 registered nearly 30 shots but only one player scored in the game : @entity44 in the 16th minute			0
@entity5 entered saturday three points above the relegation zone			1
" this is a step backwards , " @entity32 told @entity47			0
" sometimes it 's hard to find an explanation when you lose but we just could n't get the goal			0
" teams like @entity5 who are playing for their @entity6 survival live and die on chances like the one they scored but that was too much punishment for us			2
" we tried everything we could to score			0
it hurts having taken this step backwards with so few matches left			0
" surging @entity2 visits third - last @entity67 on sunday , hoping to take three more points			0
@entity67 has won once in the league since the end of november			0
@entity71 wins the @entity73 classic after winning the league title in record time in late march , @entity74 lost its lengthy unbeaten streak , lost in the league for the first time this season and , some would say , struggled to eliminate @entity81 in the @entity4 quarterfinals			1
saturday saw another wobble , as @entity74 was soundly beaten by @entity71 3 - 0 at home in @entity73 's biggest club game			1
for @entity71 , meanwhile , it was the perfect response to exiting in the @entity4 this week to @entity16			1
@entity87 -- guilty of a miss or two against @entity16 in the second leg when another @entity71 goal would have forced extra time -- @entity92 and @entity93 scored for @entity71			2
@entity74 ended the evening with 10 men after @entity95 was given a straight red for striking @entity87 in the face in added time but worse news for @entity74 was keeper @entity101 's calf injury			0
he had to be substituted at halftime			0
@entity74 and @entity71 are expected to meet again this season , in the @entity105 finale .			2

after exiting in the @entity4 quarterfinals , @entity1 loses in @entity6
@entity1 beaten by relegation *threatened* @entity5 1 - 0 on the road on saturday
@entity16 takes over second spot from @entity1 , *downing* @entity19 4 - 0
in @entity73 , @entity74 is humbled 3 - 0 at home by @entity71
