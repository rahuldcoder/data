night gathers , and now your watch begins			0
you step into the elevator and take a last look around the courtyard of @entity5 before a bone - rattling ride lifts you 700 feet , depositing you in the whipping wind of the frigid north , high atop @entity9			2
then , as the red flames of torches flicker in the distance , you hear two telling blasts from the watchmen 's horns			2
for thousands of " @entity17 " fans , that brief immersion into the life of a @entity21 soldier in the @entity23 show is becoming a reality this week , thanks to an exhibit at the @entity27 festival that employs one of the hottest gadgets in tech. " @entity35 " is part of a traveling exhibit promoting the wildly popular fantasy epic , which returns for its fourth season next month			1
it 's built using @entity37 , a virtual - reality headset that has captured the imaginations of gamers since its $ 2.4 million debut on @entity41 in 2012			1
designed specifically for video gaming , the @entity37 provides a 360 - degree field of vision , allowing wearers to view , and react to , their surroundings in a realistic manner			1
the device 's capabilities were inspiring to @entity50 , creative director of @entity51 , the @entity52 - based visual - effects company that developed " @entity35			1
" " it 's whatever you want it to be , " said @entity50 , whose company recently scored an @entity57 for best visual effects for " gravity " and has another for 2008 's " @entity61			2
" " they know that they 're reinventing gaming , " he added			0
" there are , literally , endless possibilities			0
" at the exhibit , which also featured props , costumes and other " @entity17 " displays , visitors lined up , sometimes for several hours , for a turn in a bank of booths designed to look like the elevators that carry soldiers on the show 's massive , icy wall			1
once inside , they 're fitted with the @entity37 and a set of headphones , and the experience begins			1
the visuals are built using a gaming engine , and the booth 's floor and walls are equipped with rumble packs that help create the illusion of movement			0
a set of air vents complete the experience , flicking on and off to cool the temperature and give the sense that the wearer has , indeed , exited the elevator into a howling wind above			0
the end result is impressive			0
@entity37 's full field of view makes it difficult not to keep looking over your shoulder , expecting an unpleasant surprise			1
and when it moves you to the edge of the wall , it 's a challenge to not instinctively scramble back , despite intellectually knowing you 're standing still in an @entity109 music hall			0
@entity110 made at least one big fan with the exhibit : actor @entity113 , an avid gamer who also happens to play gentle giant @entity114 on " @entity17			1
" " i was excited to try the @entity37 ... was n't ready for the awesome , " @entity113 wrote on @entity115 after checking it out on saturday			2
" i 'm telling you , if you are excited about it , ( it 's ) better than you hope ! " in another post , he said he was picturing how the @entity37 could be used with games such as " @entity122 " and " @entity123			1
" " they will be perfect for it , " he wrote			0
@entity126 was n't the only one singing its praises			0
many of those who waited in a long line to test out the @entity110 seemed similarly wowed			0
" the @entity110 experience at the # @entity136 is ridiculously good , " tweeted @entity132 , executive producer at @entity133 " wanted it to last for hours			0
" the fourth season of " @entity17 " kicks off april 4			2
merging a popular cable tv series with cutting - edge technology appeared to be a winning combination at @entity27 , where the first five days of the 10 - day festival are devoted to film and digital culture			1
at times , the wait to get into the exhibit itself ( never mind the @entity110 experience ) was more than two hours			0
and festival organizers said that , as of sunday , " @entity17 " was the ninth-most popular topic in tweets that also mentioned @entity27			1
@entity150 to @entity27 : we 're all being watched @entity152 on ' @entity154 ' game : ' i was horrified '			2

fans at @entity27 are lining up to check out the @entity37 virtual - reality headset
headset offers a virtual world that immerses the wearer in @entity23 's " @entity17 "
a *consumer* *version* of the @entity37 is expected on the *market* within the next year
