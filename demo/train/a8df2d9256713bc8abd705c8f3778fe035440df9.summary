-- @entity2 's propaganda system appears to be working hard to belittle @entity4 president @entity3 before he heads to @entity5 for three key multilateral meetings			1
the open mockery of the @entity9 's loss in the midterm elections is likely an attempt to put the president on the defensive before he lands in @entity14 on monday			1
but it 's really little wonder that @entity2 is trying to change the subject from its own problems , both foreign and domestic			1
for a start , @entity2 president @entity21 will want no trouble from a @entity4 president as he executes his anti-corruption campaign , the primary purpose of which many believe is to consolidate and further centralize his power			2
meanwhile , @entity21 is also dealing with a restive empire , including a democracy movement in @entity29 and unrest in @entity31 , which has seen terror attacks against @entity2 civilians and paramilitary officers			2
domestically , @entity21 is not helping matters by clamping down on @entity29 residents ' rights or repressing the mostly peaceful population of @entity31			0
but @entity2 's policies are also sparking problems regionally , as @entity21 continues to press @entity2 's claims in the @entity42 and @entity43 , something @entity44 , the @entity46 and @entity47 are all strongly resisting			1
add in the fact that @entity2 's long and successful run of rapid investment and export - led growth is coming to an end with slack global demand and growing @entity2 debt , and it 's clear that @entity3 is arriving at a politically tense time in @entity14			1
@entity3 , of course , faces his own domestic political issues after the thumping his party received in tuesday 's midterms , and the incoming @entity63 @entity62 majority will be eager to work with the president to get tougher on @entity2 and assert @entity4 power and influence in @entity5			1
with all this in mind , what should @entity3 be pushing for as he meets leaders from the region ? here 's a five - point wish list for the president that will help get @entity4 policy in the @entity71 on track : bring the @entity76 to a quick conclusion : the @entity76 -- a free - trade agreement that would involve 12 countries , including the @entity4 -- is not only good for the @entity4 economy , but is also good for @entity4 foreign policy			2
a successful negotiation of the agreement and quick ratification in @entity85 would demonstrate that only the @entity4 can lead on trade liberalization in the @entity71			0
push back over @entity87 : @entity3 should have the @entity88 announce , in conjunction with @entity91 friends and allies , that it is implementing new moves to counter @entity2 coercive moves in the @entity87			1
this initiative should include a major effort by the @entity4 to develop a coalition maritime domain awareness system that would allow all friends and allies to have the same real - time intelligence and information about @entity2 aggressive activities			0
this should be the building block for an allied defense organization in @entity5			0
reinvigorate @entity44 ties : the administration should work with @entity44 on a comprehensive plan to stop @entity2 coercion in the @entity109			1
@entity44 prime minister @entity110 has outlined a forward - leaning defense strategy with plenty of room for integration of air and naval forces			0
there is much @entity44 and the @entity4 can do to ramp up shows of force and exercises to demonstrate that @entity2 will not gain anything through its continued harassment of @entity44 commercial and defense assets in these seas			1
be honest about @entity2 's shortcomings : @entity3 should follow @entity2 's cue and criticize the @entity2 leadership			1
it is past time to speak forcefully about @entity21 's failure to reform the @entity2 economy and to bring up his human rights crackdown throughout @entity2			0
it is also time to side with the growing number of @entity2 who are fighting for basic human rights			0
@entity137 's energy advantage : @entity3 should take advantage of the @entity4 energy revolution to shore up alliances and friendships with major gas consumers , such as @entity144 , @entity145 , and @entity44			2
a public commitment by @entity3 while in @entity5 to fast - track licenses for companies seeking to export gas to friends and allies would be a serious demonstration of leadership			0
the reality is that @entity2 is trying to define @entity3 as a weak leader , and by extension , the @entity4 as a weakening country			1
but structurally , the @entity4 is far stronger than many assume			0
it has close friends and allies in the region , it is becoming a net energy producer , it has the world 's most powerful and tested military , and it has a set of principles and ideals that speak to universal hopes			0
@entity2 has none of these things			0
during his time in @entity5 , @entity3 can begin to reverse the dangerous perception of a @entity4 that is weakening while @entity2 rises			2
this week offers as good a time as any to start pushing back .			0
