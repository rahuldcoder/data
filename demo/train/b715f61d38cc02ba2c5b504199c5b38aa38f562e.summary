-- @entity2 math question : what has 78 fingers , 22 arms , and no brain ? answer : " @entity8 , " the robot band with a surprisingly human sound			1
listen to this three - piece with your eyes closed and it could be any group of musicians plucking a guitar , twinkling on an electric keyboard , or beating a drum			1
sure , there 's a synthesized quality to the music -- which sweeps from orchestral to experimental rock -- but what band does n't get a little help from computers these days ? open your eyes and you 'll find something very different indeed			2
for starters , the guitarist is a humanoid looming two - meters - tall , with 78 fingers sweeping across the glowing instrument strapped to its torso			1
the rocking robot -- called march -- bangs its impressive mane of multi-colored cables in time to the music , albeit a little jerkily			2
seated a little behind is @entity39 , the drummer with 22 arms extending like a futuristic octopus and playing four times faster than any human ever could			1
and then there 's @entity45 , perhaps the most alien band member of all , a keyboardist with green lasers hitting each key with pinpoint accuracy			2
" the footage of the robot performer is almost like watching a broken human , with a skeleton of steel , and oil for blood , " said @entity54 , better known as @entity56 recording artist @entity54 , who composed the music for the mechanical band 's new ep			1
" using robots has this eerie narrative associated with it -- the twilight area between human and machine			0
it 's just a box of tricks , but it still haunts us because we see it as an impression of ourselves			0
" @entity73 created by engineers at the @entity76 , the robot band uses around 300 kilowatts of electricity , which designer @entity78 admitted : " is a big amount of power			1
" " we just bought a power board which has a switch -- many people can try to make this kind of robot in their house now			0
" the machine musicians made their stage debut at a " @entity90 " in @entity91 last year , performing an electro - rock mash - up for the screaming crowd			1
girls in space - age outfits gyrated around guitarist march , whose screen face flashed slogans like " party ! " each time the audience raised their drinks in the air , the band would play faster , in an event sponsored by the drinks company			1
soul music ? now the machine musicians are set to release a five - track album , with the first single " @entity107 , " a more melancholy tune than you might expect from a band without hearts			2
" can these robots play music that is emotionally engaging ? ' asked @entity54 , who composed the song and has experimented with electronic music in a career spanning two decades			1
" it 's a fascinating question , and one that i 've tried to explore in this project			0
i 'll let people make up their own minds			0
" so how do you create music for a machine with 78 fingers , which can hit a note every eight milliseconds ? " it 's just another way of making sound , but in this case what 's interesting is the aesthetics of the instrument , " said @entity54			1
" just like when you 're writing music for a human , there are certain possibilities and certain limits			0
the robot guitarist for example , can play much faster than a human ever could , but there is no amplification control			2
" electronic evolution if you imagine that this is the start of a robot revolution , never fear , we 've still got a fair way to go before people tire of flesh and blood performers , said @entity155			0
" is the performance going to be less compelling because it 's robots ? " he asked			0
" for me , part of the appeal has to do with hearing a familiar instrument being ' played ' in an unfamiliar fashion			0
" and behind every robot musician , is a human being bringing it to life .			0
