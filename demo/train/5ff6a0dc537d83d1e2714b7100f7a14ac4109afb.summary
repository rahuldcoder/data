@entity0 inside the @entity1 is the storied site of many key moments in @entity5 history -- from heated debates about slavery to inaugural lunches with presidents			2
but @entity0 has almost surely never hosted a departing lawmaker rapping for national tv -- that is until @entity12 gave us her now famous rendition of the hip - hop song " @entity17 " by @entity16			1
i wear your granddad 's clothes			2
i got twenty dollars in my pocket , and i 'm going to the thrift shop down the road , " @entity12 , rapped , moving her body to the beat for effect			1
it is hard to believe this is the same @entity12 who sprung onto the political scene shaking her fist in the air on the @entity1 steps , rallying tea party protesters against president @entity36 's policies			1
" i was n't politically correct , and i was n't as worried about my own political career , " she said			2
" i was really worried about the issues of the country			2
and what i was doing , i think , was just giving voice to what i would do if i was a mom back home			2
" this is @entity12 unplugged , as she exits stage right after four terms in @entity47 , eager to show that she can lighten up while still sticking to conservative principles			1
" nobody has to worry about competition from me , i 'll tell you that ! " @entity12 jokes about her rapping , which she said she learned from her 27 - year - old son @entity53 during a family trip last spring			1
related : @entity12 touts the @entity55 in final speech @entity12 has been one of the most polarizing politicians of the last five years -- and few news organizations have held her feet to the fire about controversial comments more than @entity62			1
@entity64 's " @entity65 " segment had its hands full with @entity12 statements to fact check			1
we personally spent many a long day walking the @entity1 hallways trying to find @entity12 to ask her tough questions -- most famously about her comments about frivolous presidential spending , like on a dog walker , that turned out not to be true			1
but now that she is on her way out of politics , we thought it would be interesting to get to know @entity12 beyond her big political persona			1
entering the spotlight it is hard to believe @entity12 has only been in @entity47 for eight years			1
but she made national headlines sooner than most backbenchers by embracing the tea party movement and becoming a de facto leader during the financial crisis			2
" when i first came in , one of the first things that i did is i took on the president of my own party , @entity92 , because @entity92 wanted to pass a $ 700 billion bailout for @entity94 , " she recalled explaining her " no " vote for the bill			2
" we were in a completely different realm that does n't even make sense anymore , these numbers that we 're talking about			2
$ 700 billion is a lot of money ! and so i asked the question , where did you get that figure from ? and number two , what are you going to use it for ? and i could n't get good answers			2
" she jokes that she does n't know who is more excited to see her go , @entity108 or her fellow @entity110 leaders			1
" i do n't know who 's going to miss me more when i leave @entity47 -- @entity112 or @entity113 -- i have no idea ! i 've been a thorn , i think , in both of their sides , " @entity12 said			1
sexism in politics @entity12 is eager to note that she was the only @entity110 woman to run for president in 2012 , and says sexism is still very prevalent in politics			1
" i 'll be frank with you -- the way that i see it is that i think that when women speak , i do n't think that we 're listened to the same way that a man does			0
i know that i -- i 'm in a lot of venues where i 'm the only woman			0
" " one thing that i notice is that when i walk into the room , the men are talking to each other -- when i arrive -- they 'll talk to each other when i 'm leaving , and i 'll go up to them to try and get into the group and talk with them , but it 's different			0
it 's just different , " she admitted			0
@entity12 and @entity140 in her final days in office , @entity12 took her family to a place in @entity144 @entity110 do n't visit : the @entity145			1
she scrounged around the capitol for extra tickets from colleagues not planning to attend the annual @entity150 party , so that she could bring all five of her children to see president @entity36 for the holidays			0
not surprisingly , she advised her kids to make their moments with the president count			0
" i told them , look , you only get about a second with him , " she recalled			0
" make sure whatever you say is exactly what 's in your mind			0
" her initial political experience was not working for @entity166 , as one would think , but on @entity140 's campaign			2
" the first time i ever came to this city was to dance at the inaugural ball for @entity140 and @entity171 ! which is kind of hard to believe			0
but then i saw how their policies worked out , they were a complete and utter failure , and then that 's why i became a @entity110 , and i never looked back , " @entity12 said			1
the frustrated landscaper in a lighthearted lightening round of questions , @entity12 said her theme song is " @entity181 " by @entity182 , naturally			1
who does she want to play her in a biopic ? " @entity185 , " who played @entity12 in @entity188 skits			1
if she could ask her musical idol @entity191 one question what would it be ? " ah , would you please sing at my next birthday party ! that 's what i would say -- not gon na happen ! -- but i do love him			0
" what is @entity12 's non-political reading material of choice ? " my favorite thing is landscaping			1
and so what i 'll do is , mostly i put language into search engines , and if i want to look , like , at tulip gardens , or , like , @entity209 gardens , " she said sheepishly			0
" i love @entity211 gardens , how they 're laid out			0
@entity213 gardens , @entity214 gardens			0
so , i 'm kind of a frustrated landscaper			0
" mistakes , @entity47 and beyond @entity12 admits she " made mistakes " during her time on @entity218			1
no doubt repeating some erroneous facts in conservative media about the cost of presidential trips , or ties @entity225 aide @entity224 's family had to @entity227			2
some of those comments drew attention from reporters like yours truly , who tried to walk as fast as she could in heels to ask questions			0
" that is one of the things i really like -- i run stairs here			0
when we go , like , from the basement up , i 'll be in high heels and i 'll run the stairs because , the good thing is -- you actually do get a workout , cause you can walk seven miles a day here , plus do the stairs , " will she miss us chasing after her ? " oh , of course i will , " she said with a knowing laugh			0
though she may be leaving @entity47 , there is no way she going far from the political spotlight , whatever her next act may be			1
" well i 'll be involved in 2016 one way or another , " she said shermanesquely			0
" i am not looking at being a candidate , but i fully intend to be involved			0
this is a huge election where now we are tee 'd up , both in the @entity145 and in the @entity260 , for the repeal of @entity262			0
" " when i ran for president in 2012 , that was my motivation - i wanted to repeal @entity262 ... i think that there will be a lot of momentum for that in 2016 , and i want to be a part of that voice to help that happen , " she said .			0
