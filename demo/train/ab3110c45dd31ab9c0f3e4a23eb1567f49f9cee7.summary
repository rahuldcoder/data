@entity0 -- forty - two years ago , the rev. @entity2 was assassinated in @entity0 , while promoting the importance of the content of one 's character			1
today , an @entity9 - @entity8 candidate who marched with @entity2 is hoping the voters in a @entity12 primary race will look at the color of his skin			1
@entity15 , who served as mayor of @entity0 for almost two decades until he resigned in 2009 , is making race a key part of his platform in his attempt to unseat incumbent rep. @entity21			1
@entity15 's main campaign slogan on yard signs , flyers and t - shirts is the phrase " @entity27 , " a reference to his belief that there should be at least one @entity9 representing @entity31 in @entity32			1
" i believe that it is very clear to the majority of the citizens of this community that we lack representation			0
and all we are seeking is just one , well - qualified , @entity9 to serve in an 11 - member @entity31 delegation that is currently all white , " @entity15 said			1
the august 5 primary in @entity0 ' heavily @entity12 9th @entity43 has attracted unprecedented attention from president @entity45 and the @entity46			1
both are looking beyond race and backing @entity15 's white , @entity50 opponent			1
@entity21 has the support of the @entity46 , receiving endorsements from many of its members and a contribution from its political action committee			1
the president gave @entity21 a rare , written endorsement in mid-july			2
" congressman @entity21 is a proven leader in the @entity32 and a strong voice for @entity31 , " the statement said			1
" together , we passed historic health care reform , and together we 're continuing the fight to renew our economy and bring jobs back to the @entity8 people			0
i am proud to stand with @entity21 and support his re-election to @entity32			1
" @entity15 said that even though he respects @entity45 , he was upset with his decision to get involved			1
" i 'm disappointed that the president intervened			0
this is a local race , a local race that the citizens of this community should determine the individual that they want to represent them without the interference from the @entity78 and the president , " he said			0
in addition to downplaying the endorsements , @entity15 says growing up in an impoverished part of @entity0 and spending his career serving the people of the 9th district makes him more qualified for the job			1
he draws attention to @entity21 's singing and dancing at campaign events , saying he is " trying to act black			2
" " it 's patronizing , it 's pandering , it 's almost playing on the emotions of the people			0
and @entity96 , like many in my city am resentful of that type of behavior			0
@entity21 says he is bothered by that type of rhetoric and says his opponent is desperate and looking for a ticket to @entity103			2
" you know it 's something he does , and i think it 's grasping , because i 'm not trying to be black			0
i understand the black community better than most @entity108 do because i have spent so much time working on issues , " @entity21 said			2
" i represent everybody , and i work hard for people to get them opportunities			0
and i just think that race should not be an issue in 2010			0
" four years ago , @entity21 became the first white congressman since 1972 to win the district			2
canvassing for votes this past weekend in @entity0 ' predominately african - american @entity123 community , many of his constituents re-enforced his belief that his hard work on key issues such as education , health care and the economy resonated with voters more than skin - color			1
when he met resident @entity132 and her children , she gave him a big hug for helping her oldest son find a job			0
" if it was n't for you and that education lottery , he now works with the @entity31 lottery in @entity143 , thanks to you , so you keep up the good work , " @entity132 told him with a huge smile			2
@entity15 has never lost a political election , even though he says he is always considered the underdog			2
" according to our polls , we 'll get about 80 percent of the @entity9 - @entity8 vote , and we feel comfortable with getting anywhere from 5 or 6 percent of the white vote			0
the way we calculate it , there is no way @entity21 can win			2
this is a real uphill climb for him , " he said			0
@entity21 says he is not worried about the election at all and wishes @entity15 stayed focused on the issues at hand instead of race			1
" it does get to be a drag			0
the issues should have been addressed more fully			0
there are differences ; the truth is i am a strong , hard - core @entity45 @entity167 , " @entity21 said			1
" my district needs a liberal , because we need policies that work for people			0
" @entity15 says he does not want his campaign reduced to just race and that voters should look at his unique qualifications as former mayor and school superintendent			2
but he says it would be wrong to just ignore the topic of race all together			0
" this great nation is still in denial that race matters			0
in my view , race continues to permeate every facet of @entity8 lives			0
especially white @entity8 is in a state of denial when it comes to race , " @entity15 said			0
both candidates believe that @entity2 would be proud of their work			1
" i think if dr. @entity2 were alive today , he would support the proposition that the @entity8 democracy fosters inclusion , the @entity8 democracy respects representation of diverse people in his government , and he would be sympathetic and would be encouraging to a group of people that seek representation , " @entity15 said			1
and asked about what people will be saying on august 6 , a day after the election , @entity21 says he hopes people will see @entity0 in a different light			2
" i think they will be saying that citizens of the @entity212 voted in a way that dr. @entity2 will be smiling upon , voting on the content of their character and not the color of their skin			1

@entity15 hopes voters in @entity31 's 9th district will look at color of his skin
@entity15 *challenging* incumbent rep. @entity21 in @entity12 primary
@entity21 has backing of @entity45 , @entity46
both candidates say they think @entity2 would be proud of their work
