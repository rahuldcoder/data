-- @entity1 is all about the independents			1
and that 's why it 's the best test of general election electability			2
while @entity9 's caucuses are disproportionately dominated by social conservatives , in @entity1 's open primary , independents can vote -- and they make up more than 40 % of the local electorate			2
that 's right -- in @entity1 , registered independents outnumber @entity15 or @entity16			1
it 's a libertarian instinct reflected in the state 's motto , " @entity20			0
" it 's captured in the wonderful fact that in the northern town named " @entity24 , " independents make up the bulk of the 1,000 - plus voters			0
it 's also reflected in the fact that @entity1 is one of the least religious states in the nation			2
likewise , a @entity32 poll conducted before the 2008 primary found that 55 % of @entity1 @entity15 primary voters believed that abortion should be always or mostly legal , while just 13 % of @entity1 @entity15 primary voters said abortion should be always illegal -- posing a problem for fundamentalists like @entity40 who support a constitutional ban on abortion			1
fiscal conservatives rule the roost in the @entity1 @entity15 , which is committed to the state 's anti-income tax tradition with a focus on balanced budgets and a concurrent aversion to deficit spending			1
while president @entity53 won the state by 9 percentage points in 2008 , his in - state approval rating is just 41 % today			1
to add to its relevance , @entity1 is a general election swing state , unlike , say , @entity58			2
decades ago the @entity1 was considered rock - ribbed @entity15 , but as the @entity59 moved further right , especially on social issues , @entity1 -- like much of the @entity61 -- started to declare its independence			1
@entity64 won the state twice in the 1990s , @entity63 won it in 2000 and @entity66 in 2004			0
follow developments on the @entity69 's live blog to add to the portrait of swing state diversity , the state 's two senators are split between @entity15 and @entity16 -- @entity74 and @entity75			1
the state 's governor , @entity76 , is a centrist @entity78 who was re-elected by a 75 - 25 margin and is serving his fourth term			0
he is not running for re-election in 2012			0
@entity82 has enjoyed a double - digit lead in @entity1 for months			0
it 's not surprising -- the former @entity86 governor came in second to @entity88 there in 2008			0
@entity82 holds the distinction of being the only statewide elected official from @entity86 who failed to win the @entity1 primary			0
@entity88 's endorsement of @entity82 is intended to solidify the front - runner 's status as the candidate of the responsible center - right			0
but even with the two - time @entity1 primary winner 's benediction , @entity82 could see tightening margins in the final days before tuesday 's vote			2
@entity102 has been camped out in @entity1 for the past six months , trying to rally @entity103 around his center - right campaign , promising fiscal conservatism alongside a healthy critique of absolutism on social issues			1
likewise , @entity109 , whose campaign doubled his 2008 totals in @entity9 on tuesday night , is poised for a strong showing in the @entity113			0
if @entity102 and @entity109 continue to gain support with @entity1 independent voters , they will eat into @entity82 's lead , helping @entity40 close the gap with @entity82			1
to get a sense of @entity40 's potential base in the state , remember that @entity122 came in third in 2008			2
@entity1 is a very healthy stop for the @entity15 during the january gantlet , positioned between @entity9 and @entity58			1
it gives the @entity15 a primary electorate that is representative of the audience the nominee will need to appeal to in november			0
@entity130 is a broadly diverse state , but it still has a closed primary			0
open primaries offer the broadest choice and the best test of national electability , focusing on fiscal issues rather than social issues			1
@entity1 offers the antidote to a polarized @entity15 whose primaries are too often distorted by the fringe blurring with the base			1
it is a state where centrist candidates are rewarded , reinforcing the wisdom that presidential elections are won by the candidate who connects best with moderates and the middle class			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

@entity151 : the " live free or die " state is *deeply* committed to independent thinking
he says it 's a good place for @entity15 to test candidates for national electability
voters in @entity1 *concerned* with *freedom* , fiscal conservatism , @entity151 says
@entity151 : @entity53 won state by 9 percentage points in 2008 but is less *popular* there now
