-- if there 's one more thing a true @entity5 fan should have on his or her desk besides an @entity8 and an @entity10 dock , then it 's this wonderfully crafted @entity11 action figure			2
@entity11 ' trademark black turtleneck , blue jeans , and ( removable ) rimless glasses are all there , of course , but the tiny details like the faithfully replicated @entity20 991 sneakers @entity21 wears make this one a real winner			1
action figure @entity21 even has a tiny iphone in his left hand ( he 's holding it wrong , we think ) , but perhaps the most amusing parts of this cute toy are the speech bubble cards that you can stick to @entity21 's head and write your favorite @entity34 catch phrase on it			0
the price is $ 79.90 , but we wo n't comment on whether that 's too much for @entity5 's boss , immortalized in plastic			1
just let your heart decide			0
