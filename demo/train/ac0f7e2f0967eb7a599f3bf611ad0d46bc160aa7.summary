-- when a couple left scathing comments on a travel review website that a hotel in northern @entity6 they had stayed at was a " filthy , dirty rotten stinking hovel , " they thought no more about it			1
but @entity10 and @entity11 were shocked later to see an extra Â £ 100 ( $ 156 ) added to their credit card bill			0
on investigating the couple found they had been fined by @entity16 in the seaside resort of @entity18 , which reportedly told them its policy was to charge guests who had left bad reviews			1
the pair , from @entity24 in @entity25 , wrote on @entity26 they chose the hotel because it had " ample parking , " but the car park was so full they had to park at a nearby hotel			1
@entity11 , 63 , said he " could n't believe the state of the room , " which cost Â £ 36 ( $ 56 ) a night			1
" the hot tap did n't work , when we reported it we were told they knew about it and it would be fixed in the morning ( we were only there for one night			2
) " the drawer fronts fell off when we opened the chest of drawers			0
again , they knew about this and it was supposed to be dealt with in the morning			0
" " the wallpaper was peeling off the walls , the carpet was thin , dirty and stained			0
the bed was something else , it must have come out of the ark , the base was all scuffed and dirty and the springs in the mattress attacked you in the night			0
" @entity11 complained about the fine to local trading standards officers , who passed the complaint on to @entity61			1
@entity62 , cabinet member responsible for public protection , said : " our trading standards team became aware of this issue last week			1
as a result , we have spoken to the hotel owner and asked for the policy to be removed , which has now happened			2
" " this is a unique case and not one that we have come across before			0
" @entity11 told the @entity72 he would fight to get his money refunded , adding : " annoyed is n't strong enough for how i feel about this , what happened to freedom of speech ? " everybody we have spoken to says they ( the hotel ) are not allowed to do this			2
" @entity0 was unable to contact the manager of the hotel for comment			2
in a statement , @entity26 said it deplored the practice of fining its users			1
" while thankfully such instances are very rare , it is completely against the spirit and policies of our site for any business owner to attempt to bully or intimidate reviewers who have had a negative experience			0
" where we find evidence of a business doing so , we will take action to protect the integrity of our site			0
