-- you may have just unwrapped your new ipad 2 , but rumors are already swirling about the @entity2 3			1
the always - fertile field of @entity6 rumors is once again blossoming furiously , as tech observers pore over the most minute tidbits of information to speculate on the future of the market - leading @entity6 tablet			1
while much of the chatter is just that , there are a few details to be gleaned in all the usual fervor that precedes an @entity6 " @entity18			2
" it was january 2010 when @entity6 unveiled the " magical " @entity2 , introducing much of the general public to the concept of a tablet computer for the first time			1
with the massive @entity25 set for january 10 - 13 and @entity27 / @entity26 -- billed as " the world 's ultimate fan event " for @entity6 lovers -- scheduled for january 26 - 28 , observers are wondering whether @entity6 could soon roll out the third generation of the device			1
on thursday morning , the conventional wisdom in the blogosphere seemed virtually sure that @entity6 would do so			2
but by friday , many tech pundits were saying there 's no way it will happen			0
tomorrow ? who knows ? " we 've entered a @entity44 news cycle , when @entity2 rumors are surfacing with full force , " wrote @entity40 for @entity41			1
" of course the launch date has been discussed quite a bit , as it goes with any anticipated @entity6 device			2
... but the reality with an @entity6 gadget is that we 'll have to wait and see			2
" other tidbits making the rounds ? that a new model will be rolled out february 24 , which would have been @entity55 ' birthday , or in march , the same month the ipad 2 was introduced			1
@entity57 , an analyst at research firm @entity58 , told @entity59 that a january release date might be wishful thinking			0
january is " a little suspect , " @entity57 told the blog			0
" when they make them available they want to have as many as possible			0
and my sense is that they will wait rather than make them immediately available			0
" but from folks who monitor the supply chain of @entity6 components in @entity74 and other analysts , a few plausible details have emerged : faster processor			1
several reports have suggested that the new @entity2 will have a new , faster processor that will offer quicker browsing , gaming and other activity			1
@entity6 recently started using a plant in @entity84 , @entity85 , to manufacture computer chips , according to a @entity88 report and other sources			2
analysts have speculated that facility , owned by @entity92 , could be the source of the new processors			0
it 's also a relatively safe bet to expect a higher - resolution screen , an upgrade that 's been a staple in most new permutations of @entity6 's mobile products			1
reports of a much stronger battery have also surfaced in multiple places and seem to have some merit			0
one ca n't help wonder whether @entity6 will add @entity109 , the @entity111 's voice - control " virtual assistant , " to the new @entity2 as well			1
also possible is that @entity6 will attempt to address , in some way , the recent success of the smaller , simpler @entity115 tablet from @entity116 , which costs $ 300 less than the entry - level ipad 2			1
no single tablet computer from @entity6 's competitors had gained much traction until @entity116 rolled out the fire this holiday season			2
the company says it sold more than 4 million kindles in december , and most of those are believed to be @entity127			0
how @entity6 may address that competition has prognosticators split			2
@entity131 - based @entity130 , which sparked much of thursday 's speculation with a report that the new @entity2 will be unveiled in january , also reported that the company will roll out two new tablets and that the @entity2 2 would get a price cut to let it compete more directly with the @entity122			1
( it should be noted that @entity130 has a somewhat spotty track record , doing pretty well with reports out of its native @entity131 but missing the mark more often on other news )			0
the same site quoted unnamed sources just two weeks ago saying that @entity6 would be unveiling a 7 - inch tablet to match the @entity122 , a departure that would seem unlikely unless it was in the works well before @entity116 's new gadget was announced			1
@entity57 attempted to throw cold water on the concept that @entity6 will take a step back in features to try to snuff @entity116			0
" they do n't want to create any hint of a second - class product , " he told @entity59			0
" they have no reason			0
they 're selling as many as they can make			0
and this next - generation device is going to reinforce that supply - demand dynamic			0
