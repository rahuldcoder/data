@entity0 -- election night was terrible for the @entity3 , and @entity4 was not spared			1
@entity5 visited 20 states and stumped for 26 candidates ahead of @entity8 2014			1
her midterm record was an abysmal 11 wins , 14 losses and one runoff , according to @entity1 projections			0
but there is an argument - @entity5 advisers will spin it to you - in the context of what appears to be an all - but - certain run in 2016 , that her midterm record is far less important than what she gained while campaigning for @entity3			1
re-learning to stump going into the @entity28 , @entity5 's mostly paid speeches were corporate and dull			1
she addressed audiences that were full of executive types who did not alawys seem excited to see her ; many of whom were attending conferences that had no connection to the former secretary of state			0
that changed during @entity5 's time on the campaign trail			1
the former secretary of state stretched her long - dormant political legs and toyed with what will likely be her presidential message			0
she honed a new message based on women 's rights and opposition to @entity50 and - perhaps most importantly - got some needed practice ahead of a possible presidential run			1
when the former secretary of state took the stage at september 's @entity54 in @entity55 - her first real political speech of the year - she appeared to reporters on the ground to be flat and out - of - practice			0
that afternoon , the crowd responded with far more excitement to @entity54 , their retiring senator , and @entity5 , @entity4 's husband and the former president			1
but over time during the @entity28 , @entity5 became more comfortable on the stump			1
" elections come down often to who 's got more money , who 's peddling more fear and who turns out , " @entity5 confidently told an excited audience in @entity67 in october			1
she did n't she away from hitting her @entity75 opponents and drawing some contrast between them and the person she was endorsing			2
most noticeably , @entity5 honed her focus on women			1
nearly every event @entity5 did was geared towards some combination of mothers and grandmothers			2
in @entity86 she spoke to a " @entity88 " event , while in @entity90 it was " moms and @entity92 with @entity93 " who filled the event space			0
@entity5 seemed to embrace the theme and recognize that fact that if she runs for president , it will be from a historic perch as possibly the nation 's first woman president			1
" do n't let anyone dismiss what you 're doing today as women 's work , " she told an audience in @entity104			0
" do n't let anyone send you back to the sidelines			0
" as @entity5 has grown back into the role of retail politician , though , so have her @entity75 detractors			1
groups like the @entity115 and @entity116 learned how to prod @entity5 and poked her with emails to reporters and tweets about her gaffes			1
they sometimes drove the media conversation and seized on mistakes she made			0
shortly after the @entity129 officially turned red on tuesday , @entity128 's facebook page uploaded a photo of @entity5 and the six losing @entity129 candidates that she endorsed			1
" @entity135 , " read the photos that went gangbusters online			0
the morning after the country , effectively , turned red , the @entity115 blasted an email to reporters : " @entity139 were on the ballot			0
" ' this is bigger than a single surrogate ' @entity5 's closest confidants also do n't see tuesday as a repudiation of @entity5			1
" this is bigger than a single surrogate , " said a @entity5 source with knowledge of her midterm schedule who requested anonymity to speak candidly			2
" no surrogate is that , sort of , silver bullet			0
" the source added that going into the midterms there was a realization that @entity5 " has n't given a political speech , certainly on any regular basis , in six years			2
" given that , and despite her less than 50 percent batting average with successful candidates , people close to @entity5 felt confidant that the midterms were time well spent for the former first lady			2
" i think her going back in for @entity170 was a good example [ of not shying away from tough races ] , going to @entity55 twice , too " the source said			0
" there was no , ' oh man , we ought to pull out of here because it is going to be a loss			0
" the source argued that 2016 did n't come up a great deal during the conversations about where to go in 2014			2
growing from the book tour @entity4 's book tour was defined by her gaffes in the interviews trying to sell it			1
out of the gate , @entity5 slipped up answering questions about her and her husband 's wealth - pointing out the now mega-rich couple was " dead broke " when they left the @entity195 - and it seemed like she was never fully able to recover			1
longtime @entity5 confidants were concerned about her book tour performance			2
" with the book tour , there were a lot of unforced errors			0
that was concerning , " said one longtime @entity5 adviser			2
" it was an open question whether she was going to fumble about her wealth			0
" but watching @entity5 on the stump , the source said , it seemed that @entity5 kicked off the rust			2
" she is going to have to meet a reality where talking about only war on women issues and raising the minimum wage is not sufficient to win a national election or elections in these states , " said @entity214 , executive director of @entity116 , said after tuesday night			0
" i think that is a reality that the whole @entity3 is going to have to meet but @entity4 was gung ho about that message , too			1
" the midterms also were n't rhetorically flawless for @entity5			2
in @entity227 , the former first lady " shorthanded " a line that seemed to hint it was n't " corporations and business that create jobs			0
" @entity5 went on to walk back the comment that was , for the most part , her only noticeable gaffe for two months on the stump			0
that is a departure from her book tour , a two month long affair riddled with slips of the tongue , and confidants were happy to see her gaffe on the populist side of the party			0
" was it completely without these sort of perceived bumps ? no , " said the source with knowledge of @entity5 's midterm schedule			1
" but , at the end of the day , was it viewed as time well spent ? yes			0

@entity4 helped @entity3 campaign during the 2014 @entity28
@entity5 found a voice campaigning for other @entity3 and honed what will likely be her 2016 message
@entity5 's @entity75 detractors also grew and learned how to effectively attack @entity5
