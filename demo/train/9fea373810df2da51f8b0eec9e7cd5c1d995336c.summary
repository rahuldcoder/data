-- for the past week - and - a - half , people have been marveling over the discovery of evidence supporting " inflation , " the theory describing the birth pangs of the @entity7 13.7 billions years ago			1
what do these findings mean and how did they come about ? lots of articles reported the news , but i am going to try to explain it in depth			0
stick with me , because this is one of the most exciting astrophysical discoveries in decades			1
humans have wondered about the origin of the universe for millennia , and last week 's news brought us a little closer to an answer			1
what this development means , basically , is that for the first time , we may be seeing what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second of the universe			1
assuming this discovery is verified by other similar experiments , it means the very birth of the universe can be studied			2
these will tell us about the physics of matter and energy well beyond the reach of earthly particle accelerators like the @entity45			0
in a press conference on march 17 , leaders of the @entity47 ( @entity49 ) experiment announced their discovery of evidence of gravitational waves -- predicted by @entity55 's theory of @entity56 -- that were generated by the near - instantaneous expansion of the universe by some 50 factors of 10 , or a factor of 100 million , trillion , trillion			1
those waves were predicted by the theory of inflation , developed 30 years ago by @entity64 , @entity65 and others			1
inflation is the instantaneous initial expansion , far faster than the speed of light , that " describes the propulsion mechanism that drove the universe into the period of tremendous expansion that we call the @entity7 , " as @entity64 put it			1
incidentally , the term " @entity7 " was coined as an insult by a physicist who did n't like the theory			1
the @entity7 idea itself is simple			1
@entity80 -- after whom the @entity81 is named -- showed more than 80 years ago that our universe is expanding			1
objects in space are not hurtling outward : space itself is becoming bigger over time			0
that means the distance between two galaxies grows even if neither galaxy is moving through space at all			0
by extrapolating the @entity80 expansion backward , we have long known that the universe was once smaller by many , many factors of 10			1
all the mass and energy of the entire universe squeezed into such a tiny volume would have been much hotter and denser			2
then , as the universe expanded over time , the energy density went down , so the temperature cooled			2
this @entity7 idea implied that cool relic radiation should be visible today			1
indeed , this @entity7 glow of radiation was discovered in the early 1960s by two @entity108 engineers , @entity109 and @entity110 , who were trying to build the world 's best radio antenna			1
their instrument recorded a mysterious irreducible low - level noise from every direction			0
apparently worried that the surface of the antenna horn had been corrupted by , um , debris from pigeons roosting inside , the engineers repeatedly disassembled and cleaned the antenna , to no avail			0
physicists later connected this measurement to the @entity7 prediction of a cosmic microwave background , for which @entity109 and @entity110 were awarded the @entity127 in 1978			1
as a colleague at @entity108 joked , referring to their obsession with pigeon droppings , " they went looking for dung and came up with gold			0
for most of us [ scientists ] , it works the other way			0
" the @entity7 idea was well established by the 1980s			1
but it did not explain important pieces of the story			0
first , the universe looks pretty homogeneous and isotropic -- that is , galaxies in any one direction look very similar to galaxies in the opposite direction , no matter how distant			2
the number of galaxies , their masses , their shapes and their stellar content are remarkably similar , to the furthest reaches we can observe			0
this is surprising because the @entity7 - @entity80 expansion implied that very distant regions should never have been in causal contact			1
how then could they be so similar ? here is a simple analogy : imagine a thermos of ice water and a thermos of hot tea			0
as long as these two liquids are separate , they will have different temperatures			0
but if the two liquids are combined , the mixed liquid will quickly reach an intermediate temperature			0
similarly , two well - separated regions of the universe can be alike only if they were at one time in contact			2
the theory of inflation explains this quite naturally : if at the beginning the universe inflated at an extraordinarily rapid rate -- much faster than the @entity80 - measured expansion today -- then all parts of the universe visible today were once in contact			1
that means they had the same initial physical conditions ( such as temperature and density ) , so that similar stars and galaxies eventually formed out of the cosmic soup			0
inflation also explains why the universe has a very " flat " geometry -- something revealed in the 1990s by analysis of the spatial distribution of tiny fluctuations ( hot and cold spots ) in the cosmic microwave background radiation			1
in principle , other geometries of space were possible			0
for example , a two - dimensional surface can be flat like a table ; convex like the surface of a sphere ( also called closed ) ; or concave like the surface of a saddle ( also called open )			0
for the universe to be flat requires a very precise balance			2
it has infinitely more ways to be open or closed , with strong curvature , weak curvature , or anything in between			0
but to be flat -- well , that 's like balancing on a knife edge			0
inflation naturally explains this odd fact			2
specifically , the idea is that , at the very beginning , the universe must have inflated enough to stretch the fabric of space until no trace of curvature remained			2
imagine inflating a beach ball to the size of the @entity229 : you can easily see the curvature of the beach ball in your hands but once it 's hyper - inflated , any piece of its surface seems very flat , just as the @entity229 feels flat locally			0
the enormous inflation in size would effectively erase the initial conditions in the universe			1
whatever the initial temperature , for example , inflation would cool the universe to absolute zero			1
even if the initial universe were very lumpy , after inflation we can see only a very smooth , local part of the original volume -- and it would seem perfectly flat			1
after about one hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second , according to theorists , whatever repulsive gravity caused inflation then transformed into a hot , dense soup of particles and energy			2
at this point , the @entity7 expansion that @entity80 discovered took over			1
how inflation began and how it ended are not yet understood , but this simple idea of inflation neatly explains otherwise odd characteristics -- isotropy and flatness -- of our universe			1
still , until now , there had been no direct evidence of inflation			1
what @entity49 saw was the imprint of inflation on the cosmic microwave background radiation			2
specifically , inflation should have generated a lot of gravitational waves -- that is , it would cause propagating ripples of space itself			2
such waves have a characteristic pattern , squeezing space rhythmically in one direction then the perpendicular direction , like two hands pressing a rubber ball top to bottom then side to side			0
this distortion of space causes a special pattern of polarization in the @entity294			0
so what is polarization ? light is a wave that oscillates back and forth -- polarized light oscillates preferentially in one plane			2
because most light is a mix of random directions of polarization , its net polarization is zero			2
but any scattered light , like sunlight reflected off water , is polarized -- which is why polarized sunglasses cut down substantially on glare			2
@entity49 scientists searched for that special pattern of polarization in the cosmic microwave background that would show the evidence of inflation , working for several years analyzing and reanalyzing their data			1
as they ran through every possible check of the analysis , team members finally began to believe they had detected the first direct signs of inflation			1
now other experiment teams are redoubling efforts to find the same signal -- or to find contradictions			0
the reported @entity49 signal is unexpectedly strong , so it should be within reach of at least some of these experiments			0
physicists around the world know : the @entity49 discovery is only the beginning of the story			0
if this result is verified by independent experiments , new , more accurate experiments will be designed to better measure the polarization imprint			0
this in turn will tell us about how matter and energy behave in conditions much hotter and denser than on @entity229 or any other place in the cosmos			0
as @entity351 once said , " @entity349 claims require extraordinary evidence			0
" let the observations begin			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity355 .			1

@entity355 describes the *sequence* of discoveries that lead to evidence of " inflation "
@entity355 : inflation , far faster than speed of light , happened in the first instant of the universe
@entity355 : theory began 80 years ago with @entity80 : *telescope* named after him
@entity355 : after inflation , the universe went into more " sedate " pace of @entity7 we see now
