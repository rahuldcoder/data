-- we 've all been there before			0
your head hits the pillow after a long day 's work , your consciousness pleasantly fading away as the sweet promise of sleep draws closer ... then it hits you -- an idea for a game - changing invention that will make you a millionaire overnight			1
come the following morning however , and the prospect of turning that once - in - a - lifetime idea into a reality seems so implausible that you swiftly forget about the whole thing and carry on with your day			1
but it need n't be like this			1
with a bit of careful planning and a dollop of determination , your somnolent stroke of genius could be on the shelves before you know it			1
@entity0 spoke to some industry experts to get you on your way			1
so , should i patent my idea immediately ? it depends who you ask			1
@entity38 , a client adviser from @entity39 -- a firm that helps inventors get their products into the marketplace -- reckons it 's the first thing you should do as soon as you 've emerged from your shed			0
" get a skilled intellectual property ( ip ) professional involved as early as possible , " he suggests			0
" you need to have formalized protection in place before coming close to the market , because there 's always a risk that a more nimble operator could rush out a copy of your idea and gain a first - mover advantage			1
" however , serial inventor @entity55 , author of " @entity57 's guide to turning your idea into your @entity59 , " argues against over-zealous patenting			1
" most inventors are very afraid that someone will steal their idea , but for the most part companies who knock - off products do n't steal ideas , they steal successful merchandise			1
they let the market work out which inventions are successful and generally do n't take the risk with things that have n't been tested			1
" however , @entity55 warns that not rushing into a patent office too early should n't be mistaken for having a lax attitude to patents protection in general			1
" get a provisional patent application in fairly early and once you 've established the commercial viability of your product , then it 's time to seriously secure your ip , " he says			1
but how do i know if my product is commercially viable ? well , this is -- quite literally if you 're lucky -- the $ 1 million question			1
@entity38 recommends testing the water for demand by starting off with a " small production run and selling through an online port such as your own website or on @entity90			0
" @entity91 , commercial director at @entity92 -- a firm that provides product design and innovation expertise -- agrees			1
he observes that starting small allows you to develop a track record and prove demand to potential investors or large retailers without taking on too much risk			0
" a little customer - base and solid feedback is a real sweetener when you 're pitching your product , " he says			2
in addition , @entity91 offers a quick , rudimentary formula for establishing a snapshot of your potential market			2
" study your competitors -- how many units are they shifting and to whom ? go online , look at user reviews for similar products -- get a flavor for the levels of enthusiasm around it , " he suggests			0
" now , let 's say you 've identified roughly a million people in the country who are in your market , you should be able to identify a market specific , typical or good penetration level as a per cent			1
for board games for example , a top game could realistically expect to reach 1.5 - 2 % of the target market			2
" @entity91 cautions that such market research is more of an art than a science , but is nonetheless crucial to establishing a rough idea of commercial viability			1
so , when do i ship my production to @entity137 ? not so fast ! @entity38 points out that although labor in @entity137 is generally much cheaper than in the @entity140 , those savings could well be offset by hefty transportation fees , especially as the cost of fuel continues to rise			0
much also depends on the type of product you 're making			2
" if it 's simple , has a low unit value and requires bulk -- like a new type of door nail -- then it might make sense to export production , " he says			0
however , other types of goods -- particularly those with a more bespoke , high - end feel -- can benefit from local manufacturing			0
" apart from the fact that you 're saving on transportation costs , it 's just much simpler			0
you 're in a better position to manage and respond quickly to problems when they inevitably arise , " says @entity38			0
@entity91 also notes that some types of product are increasingly enjoying a " marketing edge " among conscientious consumers if they are known to be locally manufactured			2
it all sounds like a lot of hard work			0
could n't i get someone else to do it ? sure , you can license your invention to an established manufacturer or brand , but be prepared for a much smaller bite of the pie			1
" a reasonable cut is in the region of 5 % , " says @entity91			0
" so if your product is on the shelves for $ 20 and selling to the retailer for $ 8 you 're taking home 40 cents per product sold			2
" as such , @entity91 adds , to make a sizeable income you 've either got to be selling in big volumes or at a high price point			0
this is starting to get complicated			0
who can i turn to for advice ? @entity55 is a member of the @entity198 ( @entity199 ) , which is itself composed of a multitude of state - level factions , each dedicated to providing support and advice to inventors			1
" a lot of first - time inventors have the blinkers on when it comes to things like understanding price -- how much someone will be prepared to pay for their product , and therefore how much they need to manufacture in order to make a profit , " says @entity55			2
" organizations like the @entity199 offer expertise based on years of experience and collective knowledge to help inventors get to grips with these issues in a very supportive way			0
" @entity91 , somewhat naturally , says that there are also a number of commercial organizations like his own who offer professional assistance in bringing products to market , but he is commendably frank about the risks associated with such services			2
" it can be difficult to get an objective opinion from some commercial businesses because they inevitably have an angle , " he admits			0
" they can be very helpful if they genuinely put your needs first , but it is important to identify those that have a vested interest in pushing you to develop a product -- even if it is not likely to generate money			2
" @entity91 recommends that budding inventors solicit referrals from trusted sources , check who else the company has worked with and if they have links with other reputable non-commercial organizations , particularly government - sponsored bodies			0
last but not least , the one thing all three men agree on is to do your research before spending a penny on anything			0
" the best way to be successful as an inventor is always to educate yourself before taking action , " concludes @entity55			0
" i ca n't promise you 'll get rich , but you 'll certainly stand a much better chance of not going broke			1

many of us have had at least one good idea for an invention , but *rarely* follow it through
getting a product to market poses many *challenges* , but none that ca n't be *overcome* with research and planning
