the @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 brought in $ 144.4 million in 2013 , a three-fold growth from the $ 51.5 million the foundation received in 2012 , according to tax documents released on wednesday			1
though the group said in a statement the boost came from a consolidation with other charities under the foundation , the jump could also be seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case @entity1 runs for president in 2016			2
" in 2013 the foundation reconsolidated the @entity23 into its operations , " @entity18 , the foundation 's chief financial officer , wrote in a letter attached to the tax forms			1
" as such , the 990 tax document shows a corresponding increase in both revenue and expenses			0
" according to the filing , nine donors collectively gave over $ 60 million			1
one donor gave $ 15 million , while three more gave around $ 10 million			1
the foundation does disclose a range of their donors online -- though they are not legally obligated to -- but the names of these donors are blacked out on the tax filing			1
" in 2013 , the @entity2 expanded our work , reinforced our financial footing , and became better positioned to maximize our impact for years to come , " @entity18 said			2
" our tax statements reflect these improvements			0
" while revenue went up , so did expenses			0
nearly 10 % -- or $ 8.1 million -- of the foundation 's $ 84.6 million in expenses was spent on travel			1
the only categories with higher expenses were salaries and wages and " conferences , conventions and meetings			0
" and now at least one conservative group , @entity56 , is calling on @entity57 to detail the foundation 's expenses to reveal whether the @entity61 ' politically - related travel during the 2014 midterms was funded by the nonprofit organization			1
" we are calling on the foundation to release details of how their travel and fundraising budget was spent so voters know the extent to which the @entity57 's use the charity to subsidize their lavish travel , courtship of potential 2016 donors , and political schedule , " the @entity56 's executive director @entity71 said in an email			2
early in 2013 , just shortly after @entity1 left her post as @entity81 's top diplomat , the foundation that was once simply known as the @entity65 was renamed to the @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2			1
@entity1 has been very visible at the foundation 's events			2
she led a number of sessions at the group 's annual @entity23 meeting in @entity89 this year and just last week led a session at a foundation event in @entity92			0
since leaving the @entity93 , @entity57 has stepped up her role in fundraising for the foundation , too			0
when @entity57 served as secretary of state , the foundation pledged to disclose their donors and stopped holding events overseas in order to avoid conflict of interest claims between her role and the foundations			0
with @entity57 eying another run at the presidency , a spokesman for the foundation said earlier this year that should @entity57 run for president , the " precedent " of what the foundation did while she served as secretary of state would serve as a guide to how they would handle her run			0

the @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 had a three-fold growth in *contributions* from 2012 to 2013
according to the tax filing , nine donors collectively gave over $ 60 million
nearly 10 % -- or $ 8.1 million -- of the foundation 's $ 84.6 million in expenses was spent on travel
