it 's not the type of plane either @entity2 or @entity4 likely planned to take home			0
but when health officials evacuate the two @entity9 aid workers infected with @entity10 in west africa , it will be the plane they take			1
the @entity12 has outfitted a @entity15 jet with an isolation pod designed and built by the @entity17 , the @entity12 and a private company			1
the pod , officially called an @entity19 , is a portable , tentlike device that ensures the flight crew and others on the flight remain safe from an infectious disease			0
a @entity9 - contracted medical charter flight left @entity26 , @entity27 , thursday afternoon , to evacuate the @entity9 , a source familiar with the travel plans told @entity30			1
at least one of them will be brought to @entity33 near the headquarters of the @entity12 in @entity35 , @entity27 , hospital officials told @entity30 's dr. @entity36			1
the @entity12 raised its travel warning for @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 from level 2 to @entity42 on thursday , warning against any nonessential travel to the region			1
since 2003 , the agency has only issued @entity42 alerts on two occasions : during the outbreak of @entity49 , severe acute respiratory syndrome , in 2003 , and in the aftermath of the 2010 @entity53 earthquake			0
the @entity12 is sending 50 additional personnel to the three countries , @entity12 director dr. @entity54 said			1
they will be working to speed up laboratory testing , trace potentially infected people and strengthen the local health care systems			1
@entity10 is believed to have killed 729 people in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity62 between march 1 and july 27 , according to the @entity63			1
stopping this particular epidemic could take months			0
it 's like fighting a forest fire , @entity54 says -- if you leave even one burning ember , the epidemic can start again			0
" it 's not going to be quick			0
it 's not going to be easy			0
but we know what to do			0
" evacuating @entity2 and @entity4 was ultimately up to the aid organizations they work for , @entity54 said			2
moving them could do more harm than the good that might come with better treatment options in a developed country			0
" i can tell you that airplanes are tough environments , " said dr. @entity80 , chief medical officer at the @entity81			0
@entity80 was a flight surgeon for 16 years in the @entity85			0
" you want to have the shortest trip possible for the best quality medical care			2
that is as available in @entity91 as it is in the @entity9 it 's a matter of how much flight they can handle			1
" the @entity9 health care system is well - prepared for @entity10 patients , experts say			1
" i think any major medical center can take care of any @entity10 patient , " said dr. @entity98 , an expert on infectious diseases at @entity101 's @entity100			1
" we have isolation rooms we use all the time			0
" these isolation rooms are used for patients suspected to have tuberculosis , @entity49 , @entity109 respiratory syndrome or another infectious disease			2
@entity98 said not much would be different for an @entity10 patient , though more stringent precautions might be taken to ensure health care workers are following all protocols			1
" but all that is minor compared to the adjustments you have to make during influenza ( season ) , for example , " he said			0
the @entity12 has quarantine stations around the country staffed 24/7			1
and most hospital staffs have been alerted and are on the lookout for @entity10 symptoms , said dr. @entity128 , chief of emergency medicine at @entity130 in @entity131			1
symptoms include fever , headache , diarrhea and vomiting			0
some patients have trouble breathing			2
doctors are asking patients with these symptoms if they have traveled recently to the three countries primarily affected by the @entity10 outbreak : @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity39			1
they 're also asking if patients have been in contact with anyone else who has traveled to the region lately			2
@entity128 said hospitals have a low threshold to isolate patients , meaning anyone who is even remotely suspected of being infected will immediately be put in an isolated @entity152 room so health officials can run tests			1
" they would most likely be flying in civilian aircraft and seek care in civilian hospitals , urgent care clinics , physicians ' offices and emergency departments , " said @entity80			2
" that is exactly why this awareness is important for all caregivers			0
" @entity10 is not airborne , he said			2
it can not be transmitted via coughs or sneezes			0
if an infected person is exhibiting symptoms , he or she can transmit the disease via bodily fluids such as blood , breast milk or semen			0
the virus does not die with a patient -- so deceased bodies can transmit the disease			0
there is no specific treatment for @entity10			2
doctors can only administer what they call " supportive therapy , " which means supporting the patient 's own immune system as it tries to battle the infection			2
this usually involves intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and shock , said @entity193 , associate director of @entity195 's @entity194			0
this therapy for @entity10 patients could also include blood or platelet transfusions and oxygen therapy			1
@entity10 can last two to three weeks , @entity193 said , so patients would remain in isolation until their symptoms subside and tests come back negative for the virus .			1

at least one victim will be brought to @entity33 near the @entity12
