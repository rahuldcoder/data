@entity0 -- on the walls of @entity5 's @entity4 hideaway are some of her most prized possessions -- portraits taken every two years of all the women in the @entity10			1
the first picture from 1988 is @entity5 , a @entity12 , and one other female senator , @entity14 @entity13 of @entity15			1
" the hemline 's a little different , the hair color , " @entity5 mused , staring at the photograph			1
" that 's when there were two			0
" the two forged a bond across party lines			0
the most recent picture , taken last year , features 17 female senators -- five @entity14 and 12 @entity25			1
@entity5 remarks that there are more women in that photograph than had served in the @entity10 in all of @entity30 history when she arrived some three decades ago			1
the @entity32 senator knows a lot about the history of female lawmakers , and she should			1
she has made a lot of it herself : the first @entity25 woman ever elected to the @entity10 in her own right ; the first woman in the @entity10 @entity25 leadership ; and in late 2010 she became the longest - serving woman ever in the @entity10			1
on saturday she will top that , becoming the longest - serving woman ever in the history of the @entity45 , surpassing rep. @entity46 of @entity47 , who represented @entity47 from 1925 to 1960			1
to mark the milestone , she invited three other women senators who span parties and generations , to talk about what @entity10 women call their " zone of civility			1
" democrat @entity57 of @entity58 and republicans @entity59 of @entity61 and @entity62 of @entity63 joined @entity5 to sit at a table that came from her childhood home and explained how hard the women of the @entity10 work to maintain a lost dynamic in @entity45 these days : comity			1
ironically , it is a relic of the old boys network that does n't really exist anymore in today 's era of partisanship : get to know each other personally , so they can work better together professionally			0
regular dinners across party lines it starts with regular dinners organized by @entity5 , whom some call the " @entity80 , " others call " coach @entity82			1
" " when the day 's over , let 's kick back and put our lipstick on and have a glass of wine , and keep the institution and @entity30 going , " @entity5 said			1
though the dinners are strictly off the record , the senators spilled a few details			1
" we talk about our families , our concerns in our lives			0
sometimes we talk about what we are working on but it 's a very collegial setting where we are trying to cultivate friendship first and foremost , " said @entity57 , who jokes they " rarely get nights off anyway , so that 's our big night out			2
" @entity59 , a moderate @entity14 who recently made a surprise announcement that she is retiring because she is fed up with the polarization in @entity45 , said , " we made the commitment to do it on a monthly basis , and to get together because it 's critical , and we naturally bond , and we have an opportunity to let our hair down			1
" @entity62 said when her husband sees one of the @entity10 women dinners on the calendar , he knows it 's non-negotiable			2
" he does n't say , ' my gosh , why are you at work so late tonight ? ' he knows that that is a time that i value because i derive so much from the conversation , from the camaraderie that we have in the hour and a half at the end of a very long day , so i make it a priority when the dinners are scheduled to be there and enjoy that conversation with friends , " @entity62 said			0
@entity5 notes that the @entity10 can be a " lonely place , " so the dinners are a refuge with " no agenda , nothing to prove [ except ] finding common ground where we 're going to talk about what we 're going to work on in other committees or circumstances			1
" " i think it 's a place that gives us energy , gives us a sense of our own community and we all really do know we can count on each other if something comes up we would be the first there , " @entity5 said			1
a bipartisan sisterhood but does this bipartisan sisterhood translate into bipartisan legislative action ? @entity62 replied that just this past week she was able to work out differences in the highway bill with @entity155 , the @entity12 overseeing it , primarily because of their personal friendship			0
@entity57 recalled getting tremendous help from @entity59 and @entity62 on the 9/11 first responders legislation			0
" i remember when i was trying to so hard to pass the 9/11 health bill , both @entity62 and @entity161 were encouraging me			0
they said we 're not going to be name sponsors in the bill for instance , but we believe in what you are doing , and i think that if you approach it a , b and c , you 'll be more effective , " gillbrand remembered			0
" i think we 're just natural allies and we trust each other			0
it 's almost instinctive , " @entity59 said , turning to @entity57 , " i can remember the conversations that we had			0
she was eliciting ideas about how to advance the bill , and so we trust another to give solid advice and to take that advice			0
" " we are all a team as women			2
we may not agree on every issue but that 's not the point , " @entity59 continued			0
" we know how to work together in the give and take of it and achieve results			0
" @entity62 offered another explanation for what makes @entity10 women different from the men : ego			2
" i do n't think that we have as much ego attached with who 's getting the credit , " said @entity62 , who noted that oftentimes with the men , it 's " my way or the highway			0
" " we 're all pretty competitive or we would n't have gotten here in the first place , but in order to achieve the results that we are looking for , i think there is less personal ego on the line , " she said			0
there is also another female trait that factors in here			2
they all say they instinctively know how to listen			0
" i think it is how we communicate the message and how we listen to what is being communicated			0
and i think that the listening part of it is an important part of how we get the results , " @entity62 said			0
four generally agree on women 's issues though they differ on everything from taxes to energy policy , they generally agree on women 's issues			2
but @entity62 recently voted with fellow republicans against free access to contraception			0
women back home in @entity63 got upset , and she said she regretted her vote			2
asked if any of her female colleagues went to her and urged her not to side with her party on this one , @entity62 made clear the answer was no. " i wish that we had had that discussion , i can honestly tell you that , " she said , and then ripped into the @entity14 on the issue			2
" i think that my party is in an unfortunate place right now as viewed by many women in this country who are feeling very anxious about what they believe to be attacks on women 's health , " she said			2
in a bitterly partisan era , @entity10 women cherish this cross-party sisterhood			1
columnist @entity248 wrote recently in the @entity249 that @entity10 men complain they no longer have time to forge such relationships			2
she joked that @entity10 women somehow do it , and it 's certainly not like they get more time in the day from their extra x chromosome			2
" if anything , these women have more demands upon them , " said @entity5 , who notes @entity57 has two young sons and @entity62 is the mother of teenagers			1
" i had to make school lunch this morning , " @entity57 chimed in , laughing			0
they talk surrounded by @entity5 's female - oriented memorabilia adorning her walls : a poster of @entity264 , the first female vice presidential candidate ; a photograph with @entity266 before she was appointed the first female secretary of state ; even a picture of the @entity269			1
@entity5 's female colleagues credit her with cultivating and maintaining these relationships , and say she starts by mentoring new @entity10 arrivals			1
" i remember when i first got appointed , she was one of the first to ask me to visit her , gave me guidance on how things work , how to pass legislation , " @entity57 recalled			0
after 12,858 days of service , that makes her the longest - serving woman in congressional history , it 's abundantly clear that creating a collegial oasis for women inside the intensely partisan atmosphere is one of her proudest accomplishments			1
" i wo n't always be here , but i hope the legacy of civility , that i 've worked with the other women to create will remain , " she said			1
@entity1 producers @entity289 and @entity291 contributed to this report			0
