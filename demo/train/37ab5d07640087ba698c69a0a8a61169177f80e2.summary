-- a commercial rocket company has announced plans to go where no other has gone before			1
@entity5 , founder and ceo of @entity7 , said tuesday that his company is building a rocket big enough to carry more cargo than any space vehicle ever built except the @entity13 moon rocket			1
@entity5 made the announcement during a news conference at the @entity16 in @entity17			0
the rocket -- called @entity19 -- will arrive at the @entity21 launch pad in @entity22 in november or december of next year and should be ready for its first test flight in late 2013 , @entity5 said			1
space x is in talks , he said , with several countries , including the @entity27 , and private companies interested in using @entity19			2
space x is paying for all the development costs leading up to and including the first test launch			1
@entity5 told @entity0 it will cost somewhere between $ 300 million and $ 500 million			0
no paying customers have come forward so far for the first test launch , @entity5 said			1
" we have lots of customers for the second , third and fourth launch , " he said , " but they did n't have the risk appetite for the first flight			2
" @entity7 says the first launches will take place at @entity21 but eventually @entity42 in @entity43 also will be used			0
@entity5 said his company is talking with @entity45 about using one of the two space shuttle launch pads for his new rocket			1
he said production of @entity19 should create a couple hundred jobs in @entity43 and @entity22			0
overall , @entity5 said , he expects a couple thousand jobs to be added during the next two years in @entity43 , @entity22 and @entity52			0
@entity5 told @entity0 he decided to build the heavy lift rocket because he needed it to put bigger satellites into orbit than his smaller @entity57 rocket can handle			2
@entity5 said he believes his new rocket will be capable of putting large payloads into orbit for $ 1,000 dollars per pound			2
the lowest current cost is roughly $ 6,000 per pound			0
@entity5 told @entity0 he wants to bring " revolutionary change , not evolutionary change , to the space business			2
" this rocket , he says , is revolutionary			0
" the public should be very excited about this			0
it re-establishes @entity27 leadership in space , " he said			0
@entity19 also will be able to carry humans to the moon or perhaps @entity72 , @entity5 said			1
because @entity19 wo n't be as big as the old @entity13 , more than one rocket would be needed to carry out those missions			1
for a mission to the moon , for instance , one rocket would carry the lander and another would be for the crew and command module			1
@entity7 already has a contract for a dozen cargo flights to the @entity83 using the smaller falcon 9			0
that rocket has already flown two successful test flights and , barring setbacks , should begin the cargo flights next year			1
space x is also in the running to replace the space shuttle program for ferrying astronauts to the space station .			0

it can carry more cargo than any space vehicle ever built except the @entity13 moon rocket
it should be ready for its first test flight in late 2013
space x is paying for all the development costs
