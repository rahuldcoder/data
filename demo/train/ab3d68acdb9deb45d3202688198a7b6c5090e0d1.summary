@entity0 -- @entity2 sat aboard @entity3 to @entity4 on the morning of august 28 thinking about where she had been and where she was going			1
a month before , she was exactly where she and her family had expected she would be : working at a marketing firm in northwest @entity11 after graduating from the @entity12 in december			1
the 24 - year - old felt underpaid , unappreciated and unmotivated			1
she knew she needed to make a change			1
after a month of planning , she accepted as job as an au pair for a family with two children in @entity20 , @entity4			2
what 's in an airport name ? sitting in her seat waiting to take off , @entity23 said she was " absolutely flipping out excited but i was so nervous			1
i thought my knees would give out			2
i had no idea what i was getting myself into			2
i was about to move in with a family i had never met on a 12 - month agreement			2
" you can learn a lot about people by looking at what they post on social media when they 're at the airport			1
that day in late august , @entity1 sent a team of more than three dozen journalists to @entity40 to document an entire day at the world 's busiest airport by volume of passengers and the number of takeoffs and landings			1
( the stories @entity1 discovered both behind the scenes and among travelers will be published on november 20			1
) at the same time , thousands of people passing through the @entity0 airport were telling their own tales via social media			1
@entity23 's close family and a few friends knew about the move , but nobody else did			2
so to officially announce her big move to the world , she took a photo of her boarding pass and passport and posted it to @entity64 with the following quote from @entity66 : " i travel not to go anywhere , but to go			2
i travel for travel 's sake			2
the great affair is to move			2
" now , two and a half months later , she has no doubts			2
though she misses her family and friends , she feels a great sense of personal achievement and growth for making the move			2
10 airport restaurants that taste like home " relocating is never an easy thing to do -- especially by yourself -- but i am too curious about the world not to , " @entity23 said			1
" i love it here , i am able to impact the lives of kids and set a good example for them			0
... sometimes the happiest decisions may not always look like the most impressive ones on a resume , but i 'm ok with that -- for the time being			0
" first step toward a lifelong dream later that day , 17 - year - old @entity95 sat in the terminal waiting for a flight to @entity98 , @entity99 , that would bring him closer to achieving a lifelong dream			1
since he was 5 years old , the high school senior from @entity103 , @entity104 , has wanted to attend the @entity105			0
the dream dates back to when he was living in @entity108 , @entity99 , and watched his aunt graduate from @entity105			1
as he got older he rooted for the school 's sports teams and told everyone that when he was old enough , he would enroll at the @entity114 school			0
so as he waited for @entity3 flight 1030 to board , he was anxious and nervous , but also excited about the three - day campus trip he was about to take			1
that 's when he posted a photo of his boarding pass on @entity64 with the caption : " my first official college visit , and it 's at @ theohiostateuniversity ! ! so ready ! ! # @entity125			0
" during the 90 - minute flight , @entity95 shared a row with his father and twin brother , who both fell asleep			1
but he was wide awake , staring out the plane 's window , thinking about his future			0
" i realized , ' wow , i 'm going to visit the college of my dreams , ' " @entity95 said			0
the visit only strengthened his resolve			0
if he is accepted , @entity95 plans to study aviation and business so that he can be a pilot for the @entity139 and then a commercial airline pilot			0
@entity95 said he needs to score higher on the sat if he wants to fulfill his dream			0
" but with hard work and the passion i have for the university , i know i can get in			0
" ' i was so happy ' @entity147 was so excited about her trip to the airport that she could n't sleep the night before			1
but she was n't flying anywhere			0
instead , the arrivals lobby at the @entity0 airport would serve as the site of her first meeting with her granddaughter , 2 - month - old @entity156			1
the @entity157 , @entity104 , woman 's son and daughter - in - law live on an air force base in @entity162 , so she had only seen pictures of her first granddaughter			0
@entity147 stood with a group of relatives in the arrivals lobby waiting for the infant to emerge with her parents			0
i was so happy , " @entity147 , 47 , said			0
" it was so special to get to see them			0
i thought i would n't see them until @entity173			0
everybody was trying to be the first one to hold the baby			0
" while @entity147 was with a large family contingent at the airport , she wanted to share the joy of meeting @entity156 with a wider group			1
so at 9:05 p.m. she posted a picture to @entity64 of herself holding the baby in her arms and looking into her eyes			0
