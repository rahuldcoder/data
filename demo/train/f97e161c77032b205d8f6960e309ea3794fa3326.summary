@entity1 , @entity0 -- blind women are being trained to use their sensitive touch to help detect breast cancer earlier and more precisely than doctors			1
the blind assistants use tape strips with braille coordinates to accurately locate cancerous lumps the program , called " @entity15 , " is the brainchild of @entity14 gynecologist dr. @entity13			1
two years ago , he created braille strips as a system of orientation , allowing the blind to carry out breast examinations			1
using these strips blind women are trained to become @entity23 ( @entity24 ) because they are more able to detect smaller lumps than sighted doctors			1
@entity27 argues that because of their disability , the blind can possess a more acutely developed sense of touch , which has proved to be a valuable asset in breast examinations			1
once the strips are placed along specific areas of the breast , they are then used to report a precise location to the doctor as the @entity41 reads their @entity43 coordinates			2
" we are turning a disability into a gift , " dr. @entity13 told @entity2			0
" it 's like the game @entity49 , " he added			0
" you have the exact location			0
" a study at the @entity56 's women 's clinic , @entity57 , concluded that @entity24 found more and smaller tumors than doctors in 450 cases			1
the identification of smaller lumps allows earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment			2
another advantage of having @entity66 is that they are able to dedicate more time to examining a patient			2
dr. @entity27 said he had previously been able to spend only a few minutes on each examination due to his other commitments , whereas @entity24 can commit half an hour			0
training takes place at the @entity74 occupational school in @entity75 , west @entity57 , a center for those who are no longer able to continue their profession because of visual impairment or blindness			1
so far , ten blind women have qualified as @entity66			1
one of the women , @entity83 , 57 , told @entity2 : " the work brings me a lot of joy			0
" @entity83 had previously practiced as a nurse before losing her sight in 2007 , but used the experience when training at @entity91 for her new role			0
the highly personal nature of the procedure means that only women will be trained			2
the @entity66 report to the doctor - for whom they act as an assistant not a replacement - who then uses this information as part of their ultimate diagnosis			0
if an abnormality is located the doctor will decide how to proceed , with ultrasounds and mammography being the most frequent course of action			0
the testing phase of the project between 2006 and 2008 has now been completed in @entity57			2
the hope is that twenty trained @entity113 will qualify every year after 2010			0
the program has been acclaimed as a success by both patients and practitioners in @entity57			1
health services in @entity119 including @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 have also registered interest in starting an equivalent of their own , @entity27 said .			0
