-- when @entity3 asked @entity4 about the difficult decision to return to the air less than a week after 9/11 , the " @entity2 " host said , " i remember not wanting to go back , not feeling ready to go back , but knowing we had to go back			1
and you know -- my concerns were minimal compared to people who really suffered			2
" @entity3 , sitting in for @entity11 , in his return to hosting after leaving " @entity18 " gets @entity4 to open up about fatherhood , politics , his career , his friendship with the late @entity17 and more			1
@entity4 's " @entity2 " guests on september 17 , 2001 , were @entity3 and @entity20 , and his completely joke - free monologue was solemnly delivered from behind his desk rather than the usual center stage			1
@entity4 praised @entity25 firefighters , police officers and mayor @entity27			1
of those who carried out the attacks , he said : " we were told that they were zealots fueled by religious fervor , and if you live to be a thousand years old , will that make any sense to you ? " when @entity3 asked @entity4 to take him back to the beginning of his career , @entity4 recalled falling behind in college until the semester he took a public speaking course at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			1
he referred to the class as a " lifeline " that made him realize he " might be able to turn this into doing something			2
" @entity4 graduated from @entity38 in 1969 and six years later went to @entity45 to try to make it as a writer			1
he found success quickly , he told @entity3 , " not because of me			0
it was just in those days ... if you wanted to go to @entity45 and become a comic or get involved in comedy , writing , performing , whatever , the blueprint for that was laid out in front of you every night on ' @entity58			0
' " the show 's host , @entity17 , often plugged comedians ' appearances at the @entity63 , and @entity4 saw the famed @entity65 comedy club as " an instant connection			1
" three years later , in 1978 , @entity4 appeared on " @entity58			1
" on that appearance , @entity17 predicted great success for the young comedian , and @entity4 , watching the old " @entity58 " clip , told @entity3 , " that breaks my heart -- to see @entity17 again			1
" @entity4 recalled @entity17 's early influence on him			1
" he was , i think , the biggest star in television			0
and i was just a kid who has followed ... the beacon of his light coming out of @entity77			0
" @entity4 called @entity17 's friendship " a tremendous blessing " and said he made a point of telling him the way he felt			1
@entity4 recalled the last time he saw @entity17			1
" the way life is , " @entity4 said , " you do n't know that that will be the last time , but it turned out to be the last time , and it could n't have been a lovelier evening			1
and i cherish that because it was unusual			0
it was not going to happen under any other circumstances			0
and it was my wife , myself , @entity17 and his wife on @entity17 's yacht that he had anchored in the @entity94			1
" and it was a friday evening and we sailed off just before sunset and went up the @entity94 , up under the @entity98 , which is lovely , turned around , now the sun is setting			0
we go out to the @entity100 and see that at night , as the sky is darkening			0
and then you turn around and we headed up the @entity104 , and you see the lower tip of @entity107 , and it was a sight and an experience			0
... you never get to see @entity25 like that			0
" @entity17 passed away in 2005			1
@entity4 has hosted " @entity111 " on @entity112 for nearly 19 years			1
before then , he hosted " @entity114 " on @entity113 for 11 years			0
one staple of both shows -- the " @entity118 " list -- is still going strong			2
" it was a cheap , easy way to refill a category and get some laughs most nights , " @entity4 said			1
when @entity3 asked if coming up with the lists was " a chore , " the " @entity2 " host joked , " not for me			1
... i 'm not even in the building			0
i 'm an old man with a facial			0
" @entity4 also said that his favorite guests -- besides @entity3 , of course -- were " people who really come and do a great job for us			2
" he counted @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 among the " handful of people who are really , really strong			0
" when @entity3 brought up the fact that , in the past , talk - show hosts have avoided politics so as not to alienate their audiences , @entity4 said , " i have been guilty of appearing to be playing partisan politics			1
however , i 'd just like to say that for the record , i am a registered independent			1
" @entity4 insisted the material drives his jokes , and noted that " no president that i am aware of got hammered harder than @entity148 -- president @entity149 -- over the @entity151 situation			2
we beat up on him			0
we still use him as a reference , and then we were desperate			0
we thought , ' well , this was so easy ' -- and then we got @entity155			2
" @entity4 said that while he may appear to have a political agenda , it 's simply a matter of who 's easier to poke fun at			2
" if a guy drops his dog or a guy straps his dog to the roof of a car or if a guy gets a shoe thrown at him , well , this is where the material is going to be , " @entity4 said			2
@entity3 also asked @entity4 about fatherhood			1
the comedian 's son , @entity171 , is 8			0
" life is no longer solely about you , " @entity4 said			2
" it 's about him			0
" @entity3 asked if @entity171 knew what his dad did for a living			0
" no , " the comedian joked , " he thinks i have a job in a metal shop			0
" @entity4 said he and his son took up skiing four years ago and very much enjoy the sport			2
@entity171 also loves animals , @entity4 told @entity3 , and likes to visit his father at work when " @entity2 " does its " @entity4 " segment or has zookeeper @entity188 as a guest			1
when @entity3 asked whether @entity171 was a " mama 's boy " or a " daddy 's boy , " @entity4 answered , " he 's a mama 's boy , for sure			2
" what 's great about being the 65 - year - old father of an 8 - year - old ? " i 'm old enough now where if i see trouble down the road , i 'll probably be dead by then , and it will be his stepfather 's problem			0
