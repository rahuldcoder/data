-- @entity1 made headlines in april when she was sworn in as president of @entity4 , becoming the first female head state in southern @entity6 and the third in the whole continent			1
more recently , she grabbed the spotlight again after deciding to sell her presidential jet and downsize the government 's car fleet			2
her move came as @entity4 , one of the world 's poorest countries , tries to cut spending and deal with its pressing economic challenges -- the government recently cut the value of its currency , the kwacha , by 40 % , to restore donor funding by meeting conditions suggested by the @entity25			1
" the fact that we had to devalue by 40 % at once means that @entity4 are feeling the shock , " @entity1 says			1
" while that is going on , they need to see , us , the commitment on our part , particularly right at the top			0
the political will needs to go through this with the people , side by side			0
" @entity1 spoke to @entity0 's @entity38 about why she believes repairing her country 's relationship with the @entity25 was so imperative for its future and why the @entity43 will no longer be held in @entity4			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : you 've introduced some fundamental changes already in your country			2
when it comes to what happened before you , relations with the @entity25 and with donors had deteriorated significantly under the previous administration			1
what was the cost to the economy and to the people of @entity4 ? @entity1 : the bad news is that it 's tragic that the former president refused to devalue the kwacha for four years			1
because what that could have meant was maybe they could have devalued the kwacha by 10 % a year			1
it would still have been 40 % by now			1
but the fact that we had to devalue by 40 % at once means that @entity4 are feeling the shock , the impact of that huge devaluation and particularly rural people , the poor are the ones that are going to be most affected			1
that is why there is the austerity plan			0
@entity0 : talking about the austerity plan , the presidential plane has been sold , the government 's car fleet has been significantly down - sized , what other plans do you have to cut government spending ? @entity85 : what i have said to my team is that at a point such as this , with 40 % adjustment in our currency , it means that @entity4 are paying the price			1
while that is going on , they need to see , us , the commitment on our part , particularly right at the top			0
the political will needs to go through this with the people , side by side			0
and so it 's not a luxury i need to have a presidential jet			2
i need to improve our relationships with our neighbors			0
it was a thing for me to do and i did it without any reservation			0
we can make that sacrifice now and in the future we shall have a plane			0
@entity0 : are you sending a message with that ? @entity85 : i 'm just sending a message to the poor , to show the people , to ordinary @entity4 that we can do this together			2
@entity0 : these are some key moves that you 've made in just a short period of time , but nearly 40 % of your money comes from aid or donors			1
and that 's very important to the development of the country			2
what about the future though ? what about getting to the point where you need less aid ? @entity85 : what i am saying every day to @entity4 is that time has come for us to move from aid to trade			1
we have picked several sectors that we think we can focus on immediately in order for us to grow our economy			0
so we have decided to diversify agriculture , we decided to develop our tourism sector , we have decided to develop our mining sector			0
so these are some of the things we 're telling @entity4 , we say this is what we need to do in order for us to get out of this total dependence on aid			2
@entity0 : the @entity25 have just agreed to provide a loan of $ 157 million , relations have been restored with some of your biggest donors			1
what are your plans for getting the economy out of this cycle of receiving aid and into more self sufficiency ? @entity85 : what we decided to do was , as soon as i was elevated to this position , was to go back on track with the @entity25			2
that was fundamental because it was going to influence all other decisions that were going to be made by all our partners that had withdrawn aid			0
i have been saying to all our donors that we have gone as far as we can			0
when there was resistance in @entity4 to stay on course with the @entity25 program , what @entity4 were being told is that this resistance is as a result of our belief that if we devalue or if we stay on course , @entity4 will suffer			1
now i came in and told them the reverse -- i said it 's not true			0
it 's when we go the other way , we pass this difficult part that everything should be fine			0
now what @entity4 need to see is that while we are making these sacrifices the international community is also moving in time to support us			2
@entity0 : the @entity43 summit was scheduled to take place in @entity4 , now it 's taking place in @entity204			1
and it 's reported because you decided you did not want to allow @entity208 's president @entity207 into the country			1
do you think it would have been better to allow him to arrive into the country and then arrest him ? @entity85 : i want you to know that i do n't have any right , @entity4 has no right to stop any president from coming to an @entity43 summit because that is an @entity43 meeting			1
but six months ago we had @entity220 summit in @entity4 and the international community told us that we should not invite president @entity207 to come to @entity4			1
the president of @entity208 came to @entity4 and attended the meeting			1
and we went from where we were , which was already bad enough to zero			0
@entity0 : in terms of donors you mean ? @entity85 : in terms of our donors was concerned			0
i did n't say that he should n't come but i made it very clear that we were not prepared to pay that price again			0
now it is the @entity43 that has decided to withdraw the summit			2
the only concern that i have is that when he was going to attend the summit in @entity6 , @entity6 said if he comes he will be arrested and @entity239 said the same			0
and the summits were not withdrawn .			0
