cyberspace discussions on @entity49 's fate have been censored			2
on @entity10 last week , bloggers who type in @entity49 's name , or even his initials @entity56 and homophones , typically got an automatic reply : " due to relevant regulations and policies , search results for ' @entity49 ' are not being displayed			2
" @entity4 's censors fuel online frenzy @entity64 , an associate professor of journalism at @entity66 in @entity67 , says the government 's actions are " not surprising			1
