-- a timid judge is a lawless judge			1
@entity4 district court judge @entity3 , it would seem , is not a timid judge			2
in deciding to lift the @entity7 's six - month moratorium on deep water drilling in the @entity9 , @entity3 certainly looks like a decisive jurist			2
his criticisms of the department 's ban were forceful			2
but @entity3 was remarkably selective in his criticism			0
he was willing to scrutinize the government harshly , but not the oil industry			1
his opinion made important points about the department 's mistakes			0
he noted that the moratorium affects drilling in water deeper than 500 feet , even though a scientific panel that the department commissioned expressed concern with wells in water deeper than 1,000 feet			2
he worried that the department had no framework for lifting the moratorium			0
and he is not wrong to suggest that the moratorium might reflect political rather than scientific judgment			0
@entity3 's opinion also properly expressed concern that the livelihoods of many @entity9 residents depend on continued oil production			2
@entity3 , however , did not similarly train his critical eye toward the oil industry			1
he stated that we can not conclude that " because one rig failed			0
all companies and rigs drilling new wells at over 500 feet also universally present an imminent danger			1
" that is simply false			0
the accident reveals exactly what the contingency plan is when equipment fails in a deep water rig ; the plan is not to have the equipment fail			2
this is much akin to the @entity55 's contingency plan for hitting an iceberg ; the plan was not to hit an iceberg			2
to be sure , the oil companies had complied with regulatory requirements that they file contingency plans			1
plans exist on paper , but they are completely worthless			2
some of these plans literately call for the hiring of an expert , who is now deceased , in an effort to protect walruses , which do not live in the @entity9			0
consequently , we have witnessed two months of @entity70 foundering from one ad hoc scheme to another while millions of gallons of oil pour into the @entity9			1
by filing a lawsuit against the department 's moratorium , oil companies have shown that they do not intend to use this disaster as an opportunity to craft a meaningful response plan based on sound engineering principles			1
the suit itself shows remarkable hubris in which the oil companies demand the right to continue drilling on federal land , as if nothing had happened			1
@entity3 's decision , unfortunately , might allow them to do just that			0
opinion : the case against the moratorium @entity3 had all the facts he needed to judge both the department and the oil companies to be sloppy			1
he critiqued the department thoroughly			0
but as to the oil industry , he concluded that " no one yet knows why " the @entity103 rig failed			1
that is true enough , but we certainly know that no oil company has a sensible means of responding to a deep water blow out			0
the reality is that drilling for oil in the @entity9 is more dangerous than we thought , and more precautions are in order before proceeding			1
@entity3 's sensitivity to employees on the drilling rigs is appropriate , but myopic			0
a moratorium can force the oil companies operating in the @entity9 to craft a realistic plan for addressing a deep water blowout			1
with a moratorium in place , oil companies have enormous incentives to identify a sound set of contingencies for the kind of accident we have seen that would reduce the flow of oil long before a relief well can be dug			1
@entity3 's lifting of the moratorium is akin to allowing the passenger ships to cross the @entity136 without an adequate supply of lifeboats right after the @entity55 sank			0
fortunately , the department will likely appeal the ruling , or re-issue it with further justification			0
deepwater drilling is and will remain a valuable part of @entity4 's energy supply			0
one - third of domestic oil production comes from the @entity9 , and comes from increasingly deep waters			0
the fact that engineers can devise ways to send a pipe through 2 miles of rock under a mile of water is itself amazing			0
but such drilling has inherent risks , and oil companies need to use these engineering techniques to develop a coherent plan b before they proceed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			1

@entity161 says judge is willing to scrutinize terms of ban , but not oil industry so much
judge says @entity70 spill does *n't* presage others ; but companies still lack sound disaster plans
oil companies ' suit shows they *'d* like to keep drilling as though nothing has happened , he says
@entity161 : @entity179 would force oil companies to come up with plan to *prevent* *future* disasters
