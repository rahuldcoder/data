so says @entity2 , the world - famous physicist who controversially argues in a new book that @entity5 did not create the universe			1
" @entity5 may exist , but science can explain the universe without the need for a creator , " @entity2 told @entity0 's " @entity12 " in an interview that aired friday			1
@entity2 , 68 , says in his book " @entity13 " that , given the existence of gravity , the universe can and will create itself from nothing			1
" spontaneous creation , " he writes , is the reason why the universe and humanity exist			0
" gravity and quantum theory cause universes to be created spontaneously out of nothing , " @entity2 told @entity22			2
@entity22 asked @entity2 why he thinks people have reacted so strongly to his book			1
" science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion , " @entity2 replied			2
" the scientific account is complete			0
" @entity2 said his book is an attempt to give a " broad picture of how the universe operates and our place in it			1
it is a basic human desire and it also puts our worries in perspective			0
" the idea behind it is " m - theory , " which , he says , allows there to be many universes that were created out of nothing , none of which required the intervention of @entity5			2
that 's because if there are many universes , one will have laws of physics like ours -- and in such a universe , something not only can , but must , arise from nothing , @entity2 says			1
therefore , he concludes , there 's no need for @entity5 to have played a part			2
that 's the point of his book , @entity2 told @entity22 -- " that science can explain the universe , and that we do n't need @entity5 to explain why there is something rather than nothing , or why the laws of nature are what they are			1
" @entity2 said that if he could travel through time -- which he said is theoretically possible -- he would go to the future to " find if m - theory is indeed a theory of everything			0
" @entity2 has @entity79 , or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , which has confined him to a wheelchair and leaves him unable to speak without the help of a computerized voice synthesizer			0
the disease is also known as @entity79 in the @entity85 and motor neuron disease , or @entity79 , in @entity87			0
he told @entity22 he 's doing " pretty well " with the disease , 45 years after he was first diagnosed			0
the disease has a life expectancy of two to five years , according to the @entity91 .			0
