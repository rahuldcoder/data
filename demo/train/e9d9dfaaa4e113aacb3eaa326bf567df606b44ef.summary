@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is the type of director for whom the word innovative was invented			1
@entity3 and his costume designer wife @entity7 , who is a long time collaborator			2
with a filmography comprising of just three full - length feature films , ( and one currently in post-production ) @entity3 has produced a stunning and highly visual body of work that is loved and loathed in equal measures			1
his films have a tendency to suck the viewer up into a swirling vortex of lush imagery and a lavish production style , often with a frenetic pace that one critic described as being like " a madman on @entity23 "			2
but there is a method to @entity3 's madness			1
the trio of films , " @entity29 , " an adaptation of @entity32 's " @entity31 " and " @entity33 ! " all form part of a specific filmmaking technique described by @entity3 as " the @entity37 " cinema			1
@entity3 incorporates traditional theatrical conventions into his films and morphs them to create visual treats in stories set in heightened otherworlds			1
simple devices like song and dance are then used to drive the action			0
he always surrounds himself with the same creative team for all of his projects			0
his wife , production and costume designer @entity7 , who is known as @entity51 , is intrinsic to his striking visual style			1
in his directorial debut " @entity29 , " @entity3 injected dazzling colors and energetic dance moves into the stuffy world of ballroom dancing and was credited with making the genre hip again			2
@entity3 himself was a ballroom dancer from the age of six , and the film reflects his affection for and intimate knowledge of that world			1
an intensely personal director who always draws on his own experiences , @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity67 : " art and life can not be separated , they feed each other and creative decisions are based on what will make life rich and what will enrich the story telling			1
what i make comes from a personal level			0
" it paid off for " @entity29 , " which became a global hit , winning eight @entity81 , three @entity82 , and the @entity84 's @entity83 in 1992			2
in 1996 , @entity3 worked his magic again in " @entity86 , " an @entity88 - style version of the classic love story set in latter - day @entity90 , complete with warring gangs wielding automatic weapons			1
but it was in " @entity33 ! " that the @entity37 's opulent and extravagant theatrical style would explode in , spectacular , some would say violent , fashion			1
starring @entity99 and @entity100 , it explored a young writer 's foray into the bohemian underworld of @entity104 , @entity105			0
following the film 's box - office success @entity3 landed a highly lucrative @entity109 contract , making a @entity37 - inspired 2004 film for @entity111 , starring @entity99			1
at $ 36m , it is reputedly one of the most expensive adverts of all time			0
the maverick movie - maker began his film career as an actor , training at the prestigious @entity120 in @entity121 , but it was n't long before he was employing his flamboyant and creative talent behind the scenes			0
what seems to drive @entity3 is his huge passion and appetite for all art forms			2
he is a veritable @entity130 - of - all trades : a writer - director who has produced theatre and opera pieces , worked as a guest editor for @entity136 @entity135 and in 1999 , @entity3 scored a surprise - hit single with " @entity138 ( to @entity139 )			2
" following his @entity37 trilogy , @entity3 planned to move onto epic storytelling			1
he started work on a retelling of @entity144 , set to star @entity145			0
but the film was set aside when @entity148 's version was released -- and flopped -- in 2004			2
" " my next great passion after musicals is the epic -- telling a recognizable universal story using a vast canvas of a far away place and historical events , " he tells @entity2			0
" i embarked on that in my exploration of doing @entity144			0
at one stage , i was collaborating with @entity160 and @entity161			0
" we were looking at sets around the world and studios were built in @entity166 and @entity167			0
it got a long way down the road but for various reasons , not just because of the competing project , we walked away from it , " he explains			0
" for where we were in our life particularly because we were embarking on a very personal part of our story to have children , it was n't right			0
" it 's all about the timing and what is right for your life in that moment in time			0
we walked away from that and i never regret that for a second			0
" after a seven - year hiatus , during which he and @entity51 have had two " magical , incredible children , " @entity3 has finally made his epic film , simply titled " @entity192 , " with a budget of $ 130m , making it the expensive movie ever made in the country			1
" @entity192 " is a love letter to his home country			2
in it @entity99 plays an @entity0 aristocrat who travels to 1930s @entity192 to sell a cattle ranch			2
a grueling journey across country with a rough drover ( @entity205 ) ends with the pair witnessing the @entity208 bombardment of @entity209 at the start of the @entity211			0
" it 's been a long time since we 've had those huge banquet like motion pictures , when i was a kid , if a big epic was coming it was a big event and the whole family went , " @entity3 says			1
" it 's big drama , comedy , landscape -- a huge banquet and i would like to invite the audience to this cinematic table			0
" @entity3 is unsure if the departure from his normal style is a good career move but is adamant " it 's a good life move			1
" " we found our inner spirit enlivened again , " he says			0
@entity3 , ( unlike @entity51 ) , has been thus far overlooked for an @entity232 award , but " @entity192 , " a big , bold movie with a vast emotional landscape is just the sort of film the @entity232 loves			1
come 2009 , it seems they will no longer be able to ignore @entity3 's considerable -- and -- inimitable talents			1
what do you think of @entity3 's cinematic style ? do you love it or loathe it ? tell us your views in our sound off box below .			1

@entity3 's early cinema style is known as " the @entity37 "
a striking and highly visual and theatrical style *exemplified* in " @entity33 ! "
his new epic film " @entity192 " is a departure from this cinema style
