-- on sunday , @entity1 2.0 was launched for the @entity2 , bringing a long - sought feature to the table : making calls over @entity6			1
by now , 5 million users have downloaded the application from the @entity9 , showing just how important this feature is to users			0
unfortunately , the new feature was accompanied by an unpleasant announcement ; after august 2010 , @entity1 will start charging a monthly fee for the @entity6 calling feature on top of whatever fee you 're already paying your mobile operator for data transfer			1
@entity1 promises the fee will be reasonable			2
" we 're not going to want to price ourselves out of the market			0
i ca n't ignore the fact that consumers ( currently ) use us for free , " said @entity24 , @entity1 's general manager for mobile			0
still , one can not help but wonder how the users will react when faced with a double fee for mobile voip calls			0
how do you feel about it ? will you continue using @entity1 over @entity6 after the fee is introduced ? Â© 2010 @entity0			1
