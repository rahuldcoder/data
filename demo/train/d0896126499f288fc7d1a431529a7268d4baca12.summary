the @entity1 brothers -- @entity2 and @entity3 -- have committed to spending $ 125 million to buy elections for the @entity5 and @entity6 this cycle			1
what are they hoping to get for that hefty sum ? likely , the same self - serving agenda items they have been after for more than 30 years : tax cuts for the wealthy and big oil , eliminating the minimum wage , slashing @entity16 and dismantling @entity17			2
you know , the usual agenda of the extreme , tea party candidates their money and organizations support			2
recently , the @entity24 reported on new documents we uncovered detailing the @entity28 ' early political pursuits , including @entity1 's 1980 @entity30 campaign for vice president			1
it was a role he sought in an attempt to skirt campaign finance laws that prevented the @entity28 from otherwise pouring unlimited amounts of their fortune into their attempt to defeat revered @entity41 icon @entity40			1
the @entity1 / @entity43 1980 campaign platform was strikingly extreme			1
they ran to the far right of @entity40 , attacking him for representing " no change whatsoever from @entity47 and the @entity48			1
" they called @entity17 " the most serious threat to the future stability of our society next to the threat of nuclear war			0
" they wanted to abolish all minimum wage laws , while giving tax breaks to the rich and big oil			0
all in a self - serving attempt to drive the policy discourse further toward their extreme ideals to benefit their own bottom line			2
well , it 's now more than 30 years later , and the @entity1 agenda has n't budged			1
only now , instead of running a fringe party , they 're driving the @entity41			1
the organizations the @entity70 , such as @entity71 , and the radically conservative politicians they support frequently espouse the same positions as the 1980 @entity30 ticket			2
to understand their priorities , look no further than their body of work			0
@entity71 has repeatedly championed tax breaks for big oil companies , such as the @entity83 ' piggy bank -- @entity84 -- and railed against standards to keep our air safe to breathe and our water safe to drink			0
they 've played cheerleader for rep. @entity92 's extreme budget plans that would turn @entity16 into a voucher program and cut taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class			0
they 've poured money into statewide elections in @entity100 and @entity101 to remake the statehouses in their mold -- then lauded their politicians as they gutted education and attacked women 's rights			0
they worked to end a celebrated school integration program in @entity109 , @entity101 , and fought to stop a fix aimed at helping @entity112 homeowners in high - risk flood zones avoid paying more for flood insurance			2
this is the @entity116 , and their influence on lawmakers is undeniable			0
@entity71 keeps a scorecard of what it considers " key votes " so @entity41 in @entity122 can make sure not to upset these extreme , secretive billionaires and their war chest			1
as a result , the @entity41 establishment is becoming more and more extreme on key issues , cowering in the shadow of their power			1
@entity71 - backed candidates have supported slashing @entity16 and giving more tax breaks to the richest @entity133 while opposing a raise for working families			0
some have even called for eliminating the federal minimum wage altogether			0
voters deserve to know the truth behind the @entity28 ' self - serving agenda and just what they stand for			0
so , at @entity143 , we 've launched @entity144 , a new research and rapid response resource to highlight the truth about the @entity1 agenda and what it means for working families in states around the country			1
the @entity28 may see their boundless political spending as free speech			0
but when you look at today 's @entity41 candidates , their speech is n't free			1
it 's bought and paid for by secretive billionaires @entity2 and @entity1 in a longstanding effort to enrich themselves			2
join us on @entity163 / @entity162 .			0

@entity165 says the @entity1 brothers are even more right - wing than they let on
he looks at a 1980 campaign where @entity1 ran to defeat @entity40
today , he says , instead of running a fringe party , they 're driving the @entity41
