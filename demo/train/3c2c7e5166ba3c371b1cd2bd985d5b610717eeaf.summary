-- crowds gathered at the headquarters of a @entity4 newspaper on monday , in support of a rare protest by journalists against alleged government censorship			1
the journalists at the @entity11 paper , based in the southern @entity4 city of @entity13 , claim that an editorial calling for political reform was censored by and re-written as a tribute to @entity18 rule			1
photos published by the @entity20 and circulated on @entity4 's most popular microblogging site @entity21 showed dozens of people gathering outside the paper 's headquarters , some holding posters calling for press freedom			2
one journalist from @entity28 , which owns @entity11 , told @entity0 that colleagues joined the protest to express their outrage			1
" we stand up now because we were pushed to the limit , " the journalist , who asked to remain anonymous , said			2
some journalists have threatened to strike			1
if it goes ahead , it would be the first time an editorial staff of a major @entity4 newspaper has openly staged a strike in more than two decades , the @entity20 reported			1
the controversy emerged last week when a group of former @entity11 journalists said , in an open letter , that a local propaganda chief had dramatically altered the paper 's traditional @entity46 message , according to a translation published by the @entity49 at @entity50			1
while newspapers in @entity4 are often subject to censorship , the journalists wrote in the letter that the changes were excessive , and took place after editors had signed off on the final proofs			1
the letter also said that the official had introduced factual errors			2
a spokesperson from the @entity64 government declined to comment on the incident			2
hundreds held in @entity4 for spreading doomsday rumors the controversy intensified over the weekend after a second open letter signed by prominent scholars from @entity4 , @entity71 and @entity72 called for the local propaganda official to step down			1
on sunday , @entity11 journalists disputed a statement released by their employer			1
the statement from the paper told readers that the @entity46 greeting was written by a staff member and the online allegations that a propaganda official had interfered in the paper 's editorial were false			2
it also apologized for the errors in the article			0
however , @entity89 , the executive officer for the paper 's new media department , said he had surrendered the password to the paper 's official microblog account to the newspaper 's management			0
" i 'm not responsible for the statement to be published on that account and whatever is published in the future , " he said in a post on his personal @entity21 account that was later deleted			0
the furor has dented hopes that @entity4 's next president , @entity105 , might usher in an era of greater openness for @entity4 media			0
@entity109 , who teaches journalism at @entity111 in @entity112 , said that @entity4 's @entity113 was on guard as the country 's new leadership prepares to take the reins later this year			0
the alleged censorship at @entity11 also comes as @entity64 , the province where the paper is based , gets a new leader			1
the previous party secretary , @entity121 , who was promoted , was seen as being tolerant toward the media , @entity109 said			0
" whenever you have a new person coming in the tendency is always towards conservatism , " said @entity109 , whose book " @entity124 " examines the role media plays in shaping public opinion in @entity4			0
" it 's a changing of the guard both in @entity64 and in @entity133			0
" @entity4 blocks @entity135 website online censors deleted all comments added to @entity11 's statement and searches for the four characters that make up @entity11 's @entity4 name have been blocked from @entity21 searches since friday			0
however , some photos of monday 's protest outside the paper 's headquarters could still be found online			2
the @entity18 - backed newspaper @entity147 published an editorial on monday morning that was critical of the @entity11 journalists			1
" in the social and political environment of today 's @entity4 , the so - called free media can not exist , " it said			0
" even in @entity155 countries , the mainstream media will not choose to openly confront the government			0
to do so in @entity4 , there will certainly be losers			0
" to express their support for the paper 's journalists , some @entity21 users switched their profile photo to a black - and - white image of the newspaper 's logo			1
this story is based on reporting from @entity168 and @entity169 in @entity133 and @entity170 in @entity71			0
