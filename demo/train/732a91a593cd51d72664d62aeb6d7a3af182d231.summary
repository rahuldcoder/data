-- march 3 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : oh say can you see a new edition of @entity0 ? ' cause it starts right now ! from the @entity20 in @entity21 , i 'm @entity22			2
first up : @entity23 @entity24 : first up , president @entity25 says the @entity26 will spare no effort to learn how an outrageous attack took place			1
happened yesterday at @entity5 's @entity30			1
two @entity26 troops were shot and killed on a @entity26 military bus			1
they were security forces who were being deployed			2
@entity5 police have one suspect in custody			1
officials say that what they think happened is that the gunman rushed onto the bus while it was waiting outside the terminal and then started shooting			2
this would be a federal crime in both the @entity26 and in @entity5			1
this story was developing when we produced this show yesterday			2
for the latest : @entity50			2
crisis in @entity6 @entity24 : the fighting between @entity6 leader @entity54 's troops and the rebels who are against colonel @entity54 is getting worse			1
@entity6 aircraft bombed two parts of the country yesterday where rebels have taken control			2
in this incident that you 're watching , a @entity50 crew saw an aircraft drop two bombs near a town that has major oil and natural gas facilities			2
@entity26 officials say one option to try and push @entity54 out of power is to create a no - fly zone over @entity6			1
defense secretary @entity73 says if @entity77 orders that , the @entity26 military could do it			1
but he warned lawmakers that in order to set up the no - fly zone , first , the @entity26 would have to attack @entity6 's anti-aircraft weapons			1
@entity81 @entity82 , @entity15 : today 's first @entity83 goes out to mr. @entity85 's global studies classes at @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88 ! which of these documents discusses freedom of speech ? is it the : a ) @entity94 or @entity95 ) @entity93 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! freedom of speech is found in the @entity93			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! free speech decision @entity24 : the @entity102 , to be specific			1
people have the right to exercise their freedom of speech , even if what they 're saying is hurtful			1
that 's the ruling that the @entity26 @entity108 made yesterday in a case about the balance between free speech and privacy			1
on one side was the @entity114			0
they believe that @entity116 is punishing @entity26 for " the sin of homosexuality			1
" and they think that @entity26 troops deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality			1
church members have raised controversy by protesting near funerals for members of the military			0
that includes the 2006 funeral for @entity131 @entity130			0
@entity130 's father @entity132 -- who says his son was not gay -- is on the other side of this court case			1
he says the protesters should n't have been at the funeral , and he sued the church for invasion of privacy			0
the case made it all the way to the @entity26 @entity108			1
and in an 8 - 1 decision , the court ruled in favor of the @entity114 and said members had a right to promote their message in public settings			1
chief justice @entity150 wrote that , " speech is powerful			2
it can stir people to action , move them to tears of both joy and sorrow and -- as it did here -- inflict great pain			0
on the facts before us , we can not react to that pain by punishing the speaker			0
" he also pointed out that the protest happened far enough away from the memorial service that there was n't any indication that it interfered with the funeral			0
but chief justice @entity150 added that while @entity114 believes that @entity26 is morally flawed , many @entity26 might feel the same about @entity114			1
@entity172 @entity24 : wan na talk about this ? @entity174 to @entity175			0
we 've posted this story on today 's blog and we 're looking for your thoughts on both the controversy itself and the @entity108 's decision			1
@entity184 @entity24 : americans are split on the possibility of a government shutdown			0
according to a recent survey , 46 percent of people say a shutdown would be good because it would stop the government from going further into debt			0
44 percent say it would be bad because of the federal services that would stop running			0
it 'll be two more weeks before that possibility comes up again			0
yesterday , the @entity184 voted to keep funding the government through march 18th			0
the @entity198 passed the bill the day before			0
and once president @entity25 signs the extension , it 'll be law			0
@entity203 @entity24 : many of you might not know the name @entity207			1
back in 1991 , not a lot of other people did either			0
but that changed after something that happened twenty years ago today			2
@entity207 led @entity7 police on a high speed chase			1
the video of what happened when he was caught got attention across the country			0
a man nearby took this video , which shows the police beating @entity207			1
he was arrested , but later released without being charged			0
and a little more than a year later , four of the officers were acquitted of beating @entity207			1
the ruling caused racial tensions and set off a week - long riot in @entity7 that left 55 people dead			0
@entity227 recently sat down with @entity207 to talk about some of the struggles he 's gone through over the past two decades and what his life is like now			1
( begin video ) @entity227 , @entity234 , @entity235 : in the 20 years since his life was turned upside down , @entity207 has relocated to suburban @entity236 , @entity237			1
he 's 20 years older and , according to him , a lot wiser			2
he admits his past is riddled with bad decisions			0
if you could do it all over again , what would you do ? would you go out that night ? @entity207 , @entity244 : i would have stayed , stayed home			1
i think i would have stayed home			0
@entity248 : for years after the beating , @entity207 continued to have run - ins with the law			1
in 1996 , he was sentenced to 90 days for a hit - and - run involving his wife			0
he was also arrested several times on charges related to domestic abuse , drug intoxication and indecent exposure			0
why , after all that , that 's what people would say , especially black people , why after all that , @entity207 , are you still getting in trouble ? king : i guess the trouble that they see me in is a part of my life that i 'm working on			1
@entity248 : and 20 years later , @entity207 still lives in fear			1
years after the beating , you wore a vest ? king : oh , yeah			2
@entity248 : do you still wear a vest ? king : yeah			0
@entity248 : he wears a bulletproof vest in large crowds because threats against his life were all too real			0
the @entity283 once infiltrated a white supremacist plot to assasinate king			0
@entity286 : are you constantly looking over your shoulder ? king : i never feel safe , just things that happened			0
when you are part of history , and it changes for the better , you got a lot of devilish people out there that do n't like it			0
@entity248 : when @entity207 had the blood on his face , that mug shot of you with the blood on your face , who was he then ? king : oh man			1
a guy that was almost dead and just , like , happy to be able to still have that face , to be able to see that face			0
@entity248 : and @entity207 now ? all cleaned up , trimmed goatee , beads around his neck			1
