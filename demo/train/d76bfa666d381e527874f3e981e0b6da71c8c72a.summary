-- in his strongest words to date , @entity3 @entity2 leader @entity1 , @entity4 , tried to quash talk that he would allow another government shutdown if he becomes @entity3 majority leader next year			1
remember me ? i am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns , " @entity11 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview wednesday			2
" it 's a failed policy , " he said of shutdowns			1
earlier this month , @entity19 reported that , if selected majority leader , @entity11 plans to tell the president to accept bills reining in the administration 's policies or veto them and risk a government shutdown			1
last year 's government shutdown was hardly a popular event , and @entity11 's @entity29 opponent , @entity28 , pounced on the story			2
" senator @entity33 's shutdown promise will hurt @entity35 small businesses , " screamed a @entity28 campaign press release			0
@entity11 opposed the last shutdown , fueled by a strategy from his fellow @entity2 @entity38 , @entity39 , to only fund the government by defunding @entity41 , which passed the @entity2 - led @entity42 but had no chance in the @entity3			1
the shutdown backfired on @entity2 , and after the government reopened , @entity11 made clear he did not intend to go through it again , citing a @entity4 saying on the @entity3 floor : " there 's no education in the second kick of a mule			1
" still , @entity11 is vowing to try to roll back @entity53 regulations that @entity2 loathe , especially @entity55 rules on coal that @entity57 see as harmful to their coal - rich economy			0
he says he plans to do that , if the @entity2 takes control of the @entity3 in the midterm elections , by attaching those changes to spending bills as they move through @entity65			0
" one of the powers of @entity65 is to direct spending , and we 've had an abuse of bureaucracy across the board			0
it 's been particularly bad here in @entity35 with @entity55 and the coal industry , that needs to have some directions from @entity65 , " @entity11 told @entity0			2
" the reason @entity78 wo n't allow votes on coal in the @entity3 is he is afraid it will pass , in other words it would actually pass with @entity29 votes			0
we 're going to have those kind of votes next year if i 'm majority leader , " said @entity11			1
he again underscored he has no intention of taking that strategy all the way to a government shutdown -- noting he is often the veteran legislator who comes in at the last minute negotiate a way out with @entity29			0
" i 'm the guy that 's gotten us out of the shutdowns that some of our members have pushed us into in the past , " said @entity11			2
but he also cautioned , " that does not mean that you should send the president a total blank check with no restrictions at all on how the money is spent			0

@entity1 says shutdowns are " failed policy "
election *foe* in @entity35 . says he would allow them to occur
@entity11 hopes to become @entity3 majority leader
