-- @entity1 and @entity2 lay dead on their bed			2
on the floor near them lay the bodies of three of their children , from 11 to 14 years old			1
there were no signs of trauma , no indication of toxins in the air			1
but beside each body there were cups with liquid inside			1
these details come from court documents obtained thursday by @entity0 related to the deaths of the five @entity25 family members , documents that hint at a potentially deadly cocktail including the powerful prescription drug methadone			1
based on this evidence and perhaps more , one of the court documents states that one detective on the case " believes the property and evidence described above is evidence of the crime or crimes of homicide			1
" authorities in @entity40 , @entity25 , acknowledged thursday that the recently released information has " re-ignited interest " in the investigation into the @entity44 , whose bodies were found september 27			1
" the various affidavits written so that officers could fully investigate this tragic event seem to have raised additional questions as to the events that occurred that night , " the @entity25 city 's public safety department said in a statement			2
chief among those questions : who is responsible for the deaths ? and why did they die ? there are no firm answers yet , though the court documents made public this week do shed some light on what authorities know and believe			1
documents : empty bottles of methadone , cold and flu meds one of them describes how a biological son of @entity2 and the son 's girlfriend noticed the house was unusually quiet that late september evening and that the master bedroom door had been locked			1
once inside , they and eventually police officers came upon the eerie scene			0
the parents were in their bed , while the children were around it " covered in bedding up to their necks			2
" " officers reported there was a red liquid substance coming from the mouth of @entity2 , " a police detective wrote in an affidavit for one search warrant			2
" all of the occupants of the home were non-responsive			0
next to each of the victims was a cup / drink with a liquid inside			2
" detectives fairly quickly concluded the family members ' deaths were due to " poisoning , " though exactly what killed them has n't been officially determined			0
the @entity40 public safety department said that might not be known until late november , when the state medical examiner is expected to release autopsies			0
the fire department has concluded , however , that " there was no carbon monoxide leak " and " no toxic levels of any kind inside the home , " according to an affidavit			1
everything in the home was found " to be in good working order			2
" an affidavit for another search warrant , filed in early october , discussed other evidence found in and around the @entity40 duplex			0
a black bag put in an outside trash can , for instance , contained " 10 opened and empty boxes of nighttime cold and flu medication consistent with generic @entity127 " and " two empty boxes of allergy relief medication consistent with generic @entity130			1
" inside the home , authorities found empty bottles of liquid methadone -- a synthetic narcotic used in the treatment of heroin addiction			1
the methadone bottles had come from a drug treatment clinic , authorities said			2
@entity140 contributes to nearly 1 in 3 prescription painkiller deaths in the @entity142 , according to @entity144 findings from 2012			0
police : ' probable ... deaths were not accidental or natural ' the official documents do n't point a finger at any person , in particular , who might be behind the deaths			0
yet authorities -- who continue to investigate , including looking intently at things likely a laptop computer and cell phones found at the @entity2 's home -- believe that the entire thing was intentional			0
the court documents note that it would n't be normal for the three children -- son @entity161 , 14 ; daughter @entity162 , 12 ; and son @entity164 , 11 -- to go to sleep inside their parents ' bedroom , since they had their own rooms			1
and a police officer wrote , in one affidavit , that " with the placement of the bodies , it would appear somebody had to position the bodies after they were deceased			0
" " it is probable that these death ( s ) were not accidental or natural in any way , " the officer added			0
in a statement given thursday to @entity185 , another @entity0 affiliate , relatives of the @entity2 family said the release of the documents " was shocking to our family and unfortunately it begins to confirm our suspicions			0
" the statement did not elaborate , beyond adding : " we are upset about this new information and are struggling as we are forced to relive this horrible tragedy			0
" @entity0 's @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
