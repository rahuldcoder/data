-- have you always wanted to have your own garden and grow fresh , healthy food but did n't know quite where to start ? which vegetable varieties to go for , how far from one another to place the seeds and how much water to use ? that 's also how @entity9 felt back in 2002 , at 16 , when her father asked her to plant a garden during her school holidays			1
" i was overwhelmed by the amount of seed i had to buy , the amount of fertilizer , the wastage , " recalls @entity13			1
@entity13 quickly realized that gardening was not made easy for beginners			1
she was frustrated that she had to measure manually the correct distance between the seeds , as well as to pay a small fortune to buy what she needed , since everything came in bulk -- not to mention the badly written instructions			0
so @entity13 then decided to put her young mind to work			2
" i wanted to come up with an idea that if i only wanted to plant a meter of spinach , i only needed to buy a meter of spinach , " recalls @entity13			2
after giving it some thought , @entity13 used baking flour and liquid feritlizer to stick seeds , in calculated intervals , onto newspaper strips			1
she then went on to plant the strips in furrows			0
the experiment worked and @entity13 was encouraged by a school teacher to present her idea into an expo for young @entity52 scientists -- @entity13 's project won the gold medal			2
" i was a 16 year old girl that was barely passing science in school and the concept of me becoming a businesswoman was quite absurd , " says @entity13			2
yet , that high school idea has grown today to become @entity62 , an award - winning patented invention aiming to simplify food gardening and make it more effective			1
launched in 2010 , @entity13 's @entity68 - based startup produces a paper strip that that comes pre-packaged with seeds and organic fertilizers			1
these are spaced at the right depth and distance apart so they can be easily planted and maintained			0
the tapes , which are sold in reels , are packed by hand and cost $ 1 per meter			0
" we are passionate about starting a planting revolution , " says @entity13 , whose packaged seed strips grow vegetables , herbs and flowers			1
" so we enable anyone to be able to grow vegetables -- with little space , little education and little water			0
" @entity13 says her biodegradable strips use 80 % less water than traditional gardening methods , because they require water only at the exact location of each seed			1
and that 's one reason why she shares her product with people in urban slums where water is less available			0
so far , more than 120 community and school gardens have sprouted up with @entity13 's help			2
there are 11 official languages in @entity52 so the young entrepreneur uses simple pictures on the products ' packaging to overcome language and literacy obstacles			0
" it tells you exactly where to water , all the nutrition is already in there , " says @entity13 , who sells her planting strips throughout @entity52			1
" birds ca n't eat the seeds out of the soil ; water ca n't move the seed ; and you only need to plant as much as you have space for			0
" looking ahead , @entity13 is determined to see @entity62 grow , even outside @entity52			1
" we are hoping to be live in the @entity131 , selling on the 1st of may , " she says			0
