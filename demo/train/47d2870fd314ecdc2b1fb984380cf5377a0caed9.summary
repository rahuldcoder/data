in a case that pope @entity1 says he 's taken an interest in after speaking to one of the alleged victims , a @entity5 judge on wednesday filed preliminary charges of sexual abuse against three catholic priests and a religious teacher			1
investigating magistrate @entity12 , in the southern city of @entity11 , ordered the suspected ringleader , a priest , to post a $ 12,500 bond in order to leave jail , according to a court statement and spokeswoman			1
the suspect posted the bond , and @entity12 released the others from custody without bond , the statement said			2
the four must report regularly to authorities and ca n't have any contact or communication with two alleged male victims , the court statement said			2
the judge 's decision came two days after the four were arrested , and just a day after @entity1 told reporters that he called an alleged victim in august and urged him to come forward to authorities in @entity5			2
" the truth is the truth , and we must not hide it , " @entity1 said aboard the papal plane , @entity39 @entity38 contributor @entity36 reported in a story for the @entity44			1
the @entity1 confirmed that he received a letter from a young man describing his plight			0
" i received it and i read it , " @entity1 said of the letter			0
" i called the person and said , ' tomorrow go to your bishop			0
' i wrote to the bishop so he could start his work , do the investigation and go ahead , " the @entity1 said , @entity36 reported for the @entity44			0
@entity5 media have credited the young man 's letter to the @entity38 -- alleging the abuse when he was a teenaged altar boy -- and then the surprise phone call from the @entity1 as big steps toward preventing the events from remaining a dark secret			2
attorney @entity65 , representing all four defendants , told @entity39 that they deny the charges , while acknowledging they know the man who brought the complaint			1
the court investigation is under seal , and since it began , a second man has come forward to allege similar abuses			0
the @entity75 regional government 's education department in @entity11 is moving to terminate the contract for the high school religion teacher who 's facing the preliminary charges			1
he 's been teaching for seven years , up until friday , but authorities do not want him back in the classroom , a department spokeswoman told @entity39			0
on sunday , the archbishop of @entity11 and other clerics took the unusual step of prostrating themselves in the cathedral during @entity90 , " asking forgiveness for the sins of @entity93 , for all of the scandals that have , or might have , occurred among us , " the @entity84 website reported			0
the archbishop usually does that once a year , on @entity97 , but he lay on the floor of the cathedral sunday because of the seriousness of the allegations , a @entity84 spokeswoman said			0
the archbishop earlier had removed an unspecified number of priests from their duties pending an investigation , she said			0
the arrests of three priests in a single day over sexual abuse allegations is the biggest case of its kind in @entity5 , said a spokesman in @entity112 for the @entity5 church leadership , known as the @entity114			1
since 1997 , 10 priests have been convicted of sexual abuse , in individual cases , most recently in 2010 , the spokesman said			1
the @entity1 has called for " zero tolerance " of sexual abuse by clerics and has said @entity122 bishops " will be held accountable " for failing to protect children from such abuse .			1
