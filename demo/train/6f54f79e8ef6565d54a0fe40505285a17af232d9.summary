-- we 're barely 60 miles southeast of the home of @entity4 's latest sports phenomenon , but as kickoff approaches the atmosphere in @entity7 is , in contrast to @entity10 nights , muted at best			1
the city 's fans , it seems , do n't always have the stomach for 3.30 a.m. kickoffs			0
a mere border may separate @entity7 from @entity17 and its flagship sports franchise , @entity18 , but the city sleeps , unaware , or uncaring , that the team from the neighboring province is playing the game of their lives			1
this team , which was languishing in @entity4 's second division when property magnate @entity26 bought it in 2010 , has just played current @entity28 champions @entity27 at the @entity29 in @entity30			1
there is no feeling of ownership here of the team that has surprised everyone , and captured a historic trophy in the process , as @entity7 fans struggle to even find the @entity40 on their dials			2
the fiscal situation of this southern @entity4 team is not dissimilar to that at , say , @entity45 or @entity46 , both title hopefuls in @entity49 's overwhelmingly popular @entity48 , or @entity50 's @entity51 , who have similarly benefited enormously from the largesse of well - to - do owners			1
all three have designs on @entity58 's biggest prize , the @entity10			0
@entity4 domestic football ca n't hope to match the popularity of @entity62 or @entity63 football here in @entity7 , but even so there 's been little sense of occasion tonight			1
if anyone was capturing hearts and minds it would have been the @entity27 players , with an assured victory over the newly wealthy @entity4 , with three rapid - fire goals around the half - time whistle sealing victory in a game in which @entity78 failed to score			1
the result was never really in doubt -- the question was rather the severity of the mauling , but just to be on the same pitch in a competitive match , albeit as underdogs , is enough for many @entity88 fans			2
after all , @entity27 are the team of wunder - coach @entity89 , formerly of storied serial winners @entity91 , along with players such as midfield maestro @entity93 and @entity94 hopeful @entity95			2
while it might have been hard to tell in @entity7 , it has been arguably the biggest night of @entity18 's short existence , eclipsing even the @entity98 victory over @entity99 on away goals in october , a victory orchestrated by @entity103 's @entity102 - winning coach @entity101			0
@entity4 's last success on the @entity106 stage came over two decades earlier -- before some of the players on the pitch were even born -- when @entity110 triumphed in the now - defunct @entity111			2
@entity26 , who runs property developer @entity112 and is reportedly @entity4 's 13th richest man , energized @entity4 football when his team lifted the @entity111 trophy in october			0
and while it is nigh - on impossible to break the hegemony of the @entity28 leagues ' popularity in @entity106 , beating the best of @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 -- who supplied the other representatives of the semi-finals -- proved that @entity4 could compete with the best , regionally at least , and brought them to the world 's attention last night			0
the @entity4 team beat @entity134 champions @entity133 in saturday 's quarter final to set up the semifinal clash with @entity27 , whose form under @entity89 has been frighteningly good			1
while aspirations of beating this stellar team may be beyond the @entity4 arrivistes at present , their last match showed promise			2
with success comes profile , and with profile , fans			0
" i 'm not a fan yet , just interested , " @entity147 says by email the day before the match			0
this @entity7 - based @entity152 fan said he was planning on getting up -- or staying up -- to watch the match			2
" it makes me proud to see a @entity4 team playing at this level , and if they win i 'll think about starting to go up to watch their games in @entity78			1
" prizing the loyalty of already - declared fans like @entity147 away from their @entity28 teams might be a hard sell for an outfit that routinely plies its trade week - in , week - out in the parochial confines of the @entity166 , but the team 's run of form has started to win them new admirers , like 19 - year - old @entity26 , who comes from @entity78 but studying in @entity172 , in @entity173			1
" i am not a real fan , ' " she says , also by email			0
maybe later i 'll be more interested [ in the team ] ... [ the club 's ] success attracts me to become a fan of it			0
" @entity26 is starting a long - term project -- he is setting up football schools and recruiting the best coaches			0
" ahead of the game , she remains coy about predicting the result , but with an admirable optimism says , " i believe that my team , our @entity4 team will make a miracle			1
" but not everyone in @entity4 is convinced			0
@entity194 , president of @entity196 des @entity195 in @entity197 , tells @entity0 that he 's happy that @entity27 played a @entity4 team			1
" on one hand it 's my favorite team , and on the other it 's a team from my country , " he says via a translator			0
" it 's not that much of a test of my loyalty			0
i pay much more attention to @entity27 's games and even though @entity78 is a @entity4 team i do n't follow them so closely			1
" i hope that at some point in the future a @entity4 team will be able to rival a @entity28 team but for the present there 's still quite a gap in the skill level			1
but this is a good start , and for @entity4 teams to play @entity28 teams more often is a good learning opportunity			0

@entity7 slumbers through the @entity222 ' crunch match against @entity27
@entity27 wins the game 3 - 0 , but @entity78 fans *delight* in being on the same pitch as @entity27
the @entity4 team beat @entity134 champions @entity133 to set up the semifinal clash with @entity27
newly wealthy @entity78 is making new fans across @entity4
