-- it 's been an interesting year for @entity2			1
from getting fired from his gig on " @entity4 " to flooding @entity5 with non-sensical ramblings ( # winning anyone ? ) , and most recently , appearing on the @entity8 to wish his old co-stars good luck , he 's had his share of ups and downs			1
and tonight , he got called out for them			0
comedians @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 ( ? ) , among others , were all on - hand for @entity2 's sometimes brutal @entity23 roast , which aired shortly after his character 's mock funeral on @entity4 ( poetic timing much ? )			1
the comedians took a no - holds barred approach , taking aim at @entity2 's history of employing prostitutes and using drugs ( read eight of the meanest jokes here )			1
even @entity2 's kids were n't off - limits			1
" if you 're winning , this must not be a child custody hearing , said @entity18			0
" the only time your kids get to see you is in reruns -- do n't you want to live to see their first 12 steps ? " @entity2 laughed and applauded			2
the comedian also singled out @entity2 's ex-wife @entity44 ( who was in the audience ) , in an especially touchy bit alluding to the actor 's previous domestic violence charges			2
" [ @entity44 ] is not very bright unless @entity2 throws a lamp at her , " @entity18 said			2
he later added , while addressing @entity19 , " there 's no denying the fact that @entity19 had the hardest hitting right hook in history -- your opponents spent more time bleeding in the corner than @entity2 's ex-wives			0
" for his part , @entity2 seemed to take it all in stride and even fired back with some zingers of his own ( " i 'm done with ' the winning ' because i 've already won " )			1
although , it 's hard to imagine he did n't feel a single singe while sitting in that hot seat			0
but how about you ? did the heat from @entity2 's roast make you uncomfortable ? or were you enjoying the skewering ? do you think the jokes went too far ? or was it all fair game ? weigh in with your take in the comments below			0
