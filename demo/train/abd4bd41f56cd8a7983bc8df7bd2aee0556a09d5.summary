@entity0 , @entity1 -- fierce battles raged tuesday for control of key @entity1 cities in the east and west as @entity1 entered its fourth week of fighting and continued its descent into civil war			1
in the eastern oil city of @entity12 , rebels fired antiaircraft guns after @entity1 's air force carried out fresh raids			1
video shot by @entity17 showed that fighting was continuing in @entity19 , despite government assertions that forces loyal to @entity1 leader @entity21 controlled the oil - refining city			1
hundreds of anti-government demonstrators could be seen marching in the street , many of them pumping their fists in the air			2
as the crackle of gunfire could be heard , the demonstrators ran toward the camera			2
four men could be seen carrying a fifth , then putting him into an ambulance			2
a doctor who left the city in the morning told @entity2 that @entity21 forces had fatally shot two fellow doctors in the main square and were shooting wounded civilians rather than allowing them to be treated			1
the city 's two medical clinics were closed , he said			2
military casualties were being taken from the city by ambulance , he said			2

rebels have seized several cities and the army has fought fiercely to reclaim some of them			2

" this is what @entity83 , this is what the @entity85 , those colonialists , want			1
" he cited people from @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- " hunting children who are not mature , who have certain deficiencies ; they offer them pills			0
this is what we understood so far			0
" he called anti-government forces in @entity100 , a rebel - held town in the east , " traitors " and predicted that the @entity105 residents " are going to throw them out			0
" in @entity21 's stronghold , the capital city of @entity0 , about 100 journalists assembled during the evening in the lobby of a hotel after being told that @entity21 would arrive			1
nine hours later , just before midnight , his convoy of suvs pulled up to the hotel			2
shortly afterward , surrounded by his security detail , he strode into the lobby , waved at the throng of reporters , pumped his right fist several times into the air , retreated to a private room for an interview with a @entity124 journalist , then left via a back door without addressing the reporters			1
the interview was to air wednesday morning			0
the incident occurred hours after opposition members denied tuesday that they have been negotiating an exit deal with @entity21 , rejecting an assertion made earlier in the day by an opposition official			1
@entity21 's regime , too , denied having entered into negotiations with the rebels			1
@entity136 , a government spokesman , called reports of such negotiations " lies			0
" the @entity1 opposition is composed not of a single monolithic group , but of various groups and individuals around the country whose shared goal is to see the 68 - year - old ruler ousted			1
but their military skills tend to be rudimentary , at best , when compared with the relatively disciplined , well - armed @entity105 forces			0
" there is no one here with military experience , but have a strong heart , " said medical student @entity149 , who was manning an antiaircraft battery in the eastern @entity1 town of @entity152 after four hours of training			1
in @entity160 , @entity159 spokesman @entity158 said any departure from @entity1 of @entity21 would not exempt him , his family or others from responsibility for their actions			1

" they agreed that the common objective in @entity1 must be an immediate end to brutality and violence ; the departure of @entity21 from power as quickly as possible ; and a transition that meets the @entity1 peoples ' aspirations for freedom , dignity , and a representative government , " it said			1
both leaders agreed to go ahead with planning responses , " including surveillance , humanitarian assistance , enforcement of the arms embargo , and a no - fly zone			0
" death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000			0

the council is composed of @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and the @entity245			0

and the @entity236 said monday night they supported such an action			0
the @entity262 , which represents 56 member states , said tuesday that it wants the @entity257 to enforce a no - fly zone over @entity1			1
but any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from @entity268 and @entity269 , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power			0
@entity1 deputy foreign minister @entity273 told @entity2 on tuesday that @entity1 is not misusing its air force and that any no - fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war			1
he said the @entity1 government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion			1
he said the military " are taking purely defensive positions ; they are not taking offensive ones " except in self - defense			0
the @entity83 administration remains reluctant to move forward on a no - fly zone alone			2
" well , we want to see the international community support it , " secretary of state @entity287 told @entity17 on tuesday			0

" we 'd like to see this resolved peacefully , " @entity292 said			0
" we 'd like to see him go peacefully			0
we would like to see a new government come peacefully			0
but if that 's not possible , then we 're going to work with the international community			0
" asked if the @entity83 was considering lifting the arms embargo , she said , " well , i think everything is being looked at , but it is difficult in the midst of this civil conflict that is going on now to even know how you would do that , because right now , it 's not clear what part of the country is actually under rebel control			2
