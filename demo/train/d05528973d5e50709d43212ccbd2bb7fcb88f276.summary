@entity0 sen. @entity0 could face a brutal battle against former secretary of state @entity2 , a @entity3 , in the 2016 battle for the presidency			1
but on thursday , the @entity7 senator extended his potential rival an olive branch			2

in light of the recent verdict not to indict a white police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man , @entity28 , @entity0 said he is " shocked " that no statement has been delivered from the @entity31 police about whether the bystanding officers involved in the incident will continue to serve			1

asked about comments he made wednesday where he blamed the politician who created @entity44 's high cigarette tax for @entity28 's death , @entity0 said the black market created by heavy taxation and regulation -- whether it be food , drugs or cigarettes -- forces police officers to arrest people for mostly menial , non-offensive crimes			1
@entity28 was arrested for selling tax - free cigarettes			0
" there 's a black market because we have made the price of cigarettes so onerous that people are going to sell it illegally , " @entity0 said			1
