it was late in the day with the @entity2 oversight hearing on @entity3 winding down			1
on social media and elsewhere , there was conservative grumbling that @entity7 was getting off relatively unscathed			2
then came conservative rep. @entity8 of @entity10 's second round of questions			0
" if anyone wants to ask ' what difference does it make ? ' it always matters whether or not you can trust your government , " @entity8 said , borrowing some words from the former secretary of state			0
" and to the families , we 're going to find out what happened in @entity3 , and i do n't give a damn whose career is impacted , " @entity8 continued			1
" we 're going to find out what happened			0
" tough legitimate congressional oversight or partisan politics ? leading republicans say the former ; most @entity29 the latter			1
truth is , it is both			0
and as the @entity3 investigations continue , that presents both parties with challenges			2
for @entity44 , if they want public support for continued hearings and questions beyond the @entity43 's conservative base , the challenge is to stress the legitimate questions about the @entity48 administration 's response to the deadly attack on the @entity51 consulate -- and its conflicting explanations of why it believes the attacks happened			1
house speaker @entity55 served notice on thursday that @entity43 pressure would not subside			2
the speaker said the administration should make public a series of e-mails and other records he said would provide key details about the attacks and the response			0
@entity55 calls for @entity2 to release @entity3 emails among the records , he said , should be an e-mail from a top @entity70 official from the day after the attack			1
the e-mail , @entity55 said , refers to " islamic terrorists " as carrying out the attack			0
" a senior @entity70 official e-mailed her superiors that the @entity78 ambassador , she had told the @entity78 ambassador , the attack was conducted by @entity82 terrorists			0
the @entity70 would not allow our committees to keep copies of this e-mail when it was reviewed , " @entity55 said			0
the @entity2 and its allies in @entity88 make the case that any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the attacks stemmed from the " fog of war " -- not any deliberate effort to mislead the @entity51 people about the source of the attacks			1
doomed @entity78 ambassador : ' we 're under attack ' traveling in @entity100 , the man who replaced @entity7 , secretary of state @entity101 , said he was as determined as the @entity44 @entity2 leadership to answer any legitimate questions			1
" i have already made it crystal clear to the chairmen of the relevant committees that i have assigned my chief of staff , @entity107 , to be responsible for liaising with them to answer any questions that they have , " @entity101 said			2
" i am absolutely determined that this issue will be answered , will be put to bed			0
" " and if there is any culpability in any area that is appropriate to be handled in some way with some discipline it will be appropriately handled			0
but that judgment awaits me in a report that will be forthcoming and i am confident that any recent evidence will be a component of that consideration , " @entity101 said			0
@entity124 , who became the top diplomat in @entity78 after ambassador @entity126 was killed , suggested at wednesday 's @entity128 hearing that he was demoted and otherwise punished or making it clear he believed the @entity48 administration was withholding or ignoring key facts about the @entity3 attacks and response			2
after hearing , @entity44 say there 's more to story the committee chairman , @entity139 @entity43 rep. @entity137 , said @entity29 on the panel had shown little interest in finding the truth			1
in turn , committee @entity29 , including ranking member @entity143 of @entity144 , said @entity137 and other @entity43 members were to blame for a reckless campaign designed to " smear public officials			1
" @entity149 , the @entity51 ambassador to the @entity150 , took the most direct heat because of her assertions in a sunday television interview days after the attack that linked the attacks to a demonstration outside the @entity3 consulate			1
@entity124 said there was no demonstration and that top @entity70 officials had been told that , and he told the committee he was " stunned " and " embarrassed " by @entity162 's televised account			0
what the @entity48 administration has said about the @entity78 attack the administration concedes @entity162 spoke from flawed talking points , but insists the mistakes were born of understandable confusion			2
many republicans see it differently -- alleging the @entity48 @entity2 , in the closing days of the presidential campaign , wanted to play down the idea of a successful , coordinated terrorist attack on a @entity51 diplomatic post			1
" i do think that was the political motivation behind it , " @entity176 @entity43 sen. @entity175 said thursday on @entity177			2
" what i think is sad is how many people around the administration , including the former secretary of state , @entity7 , knew this to be the case , and allowed this to move forward anyway			2
mother of @entity3 victim : i blame @entity7 " you would 've hoped that people would have stepped up and said this was wrong and the @entity51 people deserve the truth			1
" @entity29 are quick to suggest it is @entity175 playing politics , noting his own interest in a possible 2016 presidential campaign			1
democrats make the same argument when asked about the harsh criticisms of @entity43 sen. @entity203 , another potential 2016 @entity44 contender			1
@entity203 calls @entity7 's handling of @entity3 a " dereliction of duty " that , in his view , disqualifies her from higher office			1
@entity55 tried to take a less confrontational tone on thursday , but nonetheless said the @entity2 was refusing to make public e-mails and other documents he says show the political calculation behind the @entity215 appearance and other elements of the administration 's @entity3 response			1
" the @entity2 continues to claim it only made stylistic changes to talking points used by @entity149 , ignoring the fact that senior @entity2 officials directed the changes being made " to those talking points , @entity55 said			2
conservative media outlets also clearly see an opportunity to raise questions about @entity7 that could be a factor in her 2016 calculations			2
respected conservative writer and commentator @entity236 reminded his readers this week of the initial @entity3 statement suggesting , " some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet			2
" @entity236 said the @entity70 refuses to provide information about who told @entity7 an internet posting might be a possible cause			0
@entity124 told the hearing on wednesday that @entity51 diplomats in @entity78 reported back from the very beginning that they believed it was a terrorist attack			2
among the conservatives urging @entity2 republicans to demand answers from @entity7 directly is former vice president @entity250			1
on thursday , @entity250 spoke to the weekly " @entity255 " meeting organized by @entity2 conservatives and two people present at the breakfast said the former vice president said if @entity7 declined to voluntarily answer questions , then she should be subpoenaed to testify			1
another veteran of the @entity260 administration also weighed in thursday , in a way that highlights the intersection of @entity3 oversight and @entity3 politics			1
in an e-mail sent to conservatives , former @entity150 ambassador @entity265 said , " what happened with @entity3 is not how it 's supposed to be handled and i think it could be a hinge point for the @entity48 administration			2
" the @entity272 note was distributed by the @entity2 @entity43 's campaign arm -- the @entity274 -- and asks for political contributions to the @entity43			1
in fact , if you click on the links in that @entity272 e-mail , it takes you to an @entity274 fund - raising website that declares " @entity3 was a cover - up " over a photograph of @entity7 and president @entity48			1
that definitive assertion on a @entity2 @entity43 official fund - raising site is par for the course in @entity287 these days			1
but it gives @entity29 fodder for their argument that @entity44 have already made up their minds and are n't conducting oversight hearings with an open mind			1
@entity7 is now a private citizen			0
but close allies on the committee , including @entity298 @entity29 rep. @entity297 , came to @entity7 's defense during the proceedings			1
and other longtime @entity7 political loyalists were privately nudging reporters and media outlets about the tone of the @entity3 coverage			1
one veteran @entity29 strategist , who spoke only on condition of anonymity because @entity7 chafes at those who publicly speculate about her 2016 interest , noted her overwhelming popularity among @entity29			1
" she will have to deal with this , " the strategist said , " but it will not be central to the campaign			0
" @entity317 ally and @entity29 strategist @entity316 takes a similar view			0
" once more , the @entity43 runs the risk of appearing to be blinded by their partisanship , " @entity316 said			0
" i have no idea if @entity7 will run			0
but i know this : if she does this issue will not be a major stumbling block			0
" @entity327 drew historical comparison -- between @entity7 now and then - vice president @entity329 heading into the 1988 presidential campaign			1
" @entity331 ? " @entity316 asked			0
" infinitely more damaging than @entity3			0
the @entity333 administration sold weapons to the ayatollah 's regime in @entity337 , then diverted some of the proceeds to the ( @entity341 ) @entity340 , then lied about it			0
the scandal paralyzed the @entity333 administration for 18 months			0
" there were high - level resignations and criminal convictions , @entity316 recalled			0
" there was a major joint congressional investigation , with highly publicized , televised hearings			0
there was a special prosecutor			0
it was one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century			0
and two years later , it had no impact on vice president @entity260 's campaign			0

@entity44 say @entity3 investigation legitimate congressional oversight
@entity29 say @entity43 is playing partisan politics with the attack on @entity51 consulate
@entity250 tells @entity2 conservatives that if @entity7 wo n't answer questions , she should be subpoenaed
*analyst* points to similarities between @entity7 now and @entity329 in 1988
