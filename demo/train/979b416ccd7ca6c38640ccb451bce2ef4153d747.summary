-- @entity1 says it is not responsible for the death of a drum major last year , and that he broke the law and school policies when he willingly took part in the hazing that left him dead			1
in court papers filed monday night , the school asked a judge to drop a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of 26 - year - old @entity15			1
" mr. @entity15 should have refused to participate in the planned hazing event and reported it to law enforcement or @entity1 administrators , " the court documents say			1
" under these circumstances , @entity22 's taxpayers should not be held financially liable to mr. @entity15 's estate for the ultimate result of his own imprudent , avoidable and tragic decision and death			1
" the student 's family lambasted the school tuesday for denying responsibility			2
" @entity33 family is shocked at the defense @entity1 has chosen in the brutal hazing death of @entity15 , " family attorney @entity32 said			1
" we simply can not ignore the audacity of an institution that blames students for their own deaths , yet for decades ignored the hazing epidemic occurring within its own walls			0
" in a message to @entity0 , school attorney @entity43 said @entity1 is not " blaming the victim , " but is saying " that his voluntary participation in felony hazing , as a 26 year old grown man and band leader , bars his estate 's alleged claim for taxpayer dollars as a matter of law			1
" @entity1 is publicly funded			0
champion died in november 2011 following his beating on a bus in @entity59 , @entity22 , after a football game at which the school 's famed marching band performed			2

in july , @entity33 's parents filed a lawsuit against the school 's board of trustees , the company that owns the bus in which the abuse occurred , and the driver of the bus			1
the school , in its response filed monday night , said @entity33 watched or at least heard two other students -- one female , one male -- undergoing hazing on the bus before he did , and there is " no allegation or evidence " that he attempted to stop the process before being hazed himself			2
" instead , mr. @entity15 allowed himself to be subjected to an act of hazing known as a ' hot seat , ' during which he allowed his adult body to be deprived of oxygen , punched , kicked and hit with objects , " the court documents say			2
@entity33 's injuries " arose from his participation in unlawful acts of hazing , " so the school can not be held legally liable , it argued			1
@entity1 noted that many of @entity33 's " co-conspirators are now under criminal prosecution for felony hazing , yet @entity118 has not asserted any civil claims against any of mr. @entity15 's identified hazers			1
" the family 's lawsuit said @entity1 " has a long history of knowledge of and tolerance for hazing within the " band , including incidents that led to hospitalizations over the years			1
@entity1 students will have to sign anti-hazing pledge to take classes in november , shortly before the incident involving champion , the school 's @entity140 " proposed imposing an immediate long - term suspension of the @entity138 to combat the egregious hazing , " but the school did not implement the proposal after opposition from the band director , the lawsuit alleges			1
it also argues that band members " were under the control of @entity1 at all times " during the weekend when @entity33 died			1
the bus was operated " pursuant to a valid @entity22 contract " between the bus company , fabulous coach , and @entity1 , the lawsuit says			0
the count accusing @entity1 of wrongful death says the @entity156 owed champion " a duty of care " and knew , or should have known , that the band engaged in conduct that violated laws and school policies			2
the board either " negligently failed to have any policies or procedures governing , monitoring , or disciplining @entity138 members for facilitation , participation or encouragement of hazing activities " or failed to adequately implement such policies			0
@entity1 president resigns in wake of hazing death while an amount of money was not specified , the lawsuit sought damages for wrongful death as well as for the pain and suffering of the dead man 's parents , @entity184 and @entity157			1
