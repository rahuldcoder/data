-- some of @entity2 's best footballers will be missing in @entity3 and @entity4 this month , as the effects of another grueling season takes its toll			0
the @entity8 , the only one of the continent 's major divisions not to have a winter break , is particularly brutal in its demands on players , with research by @entity2 indicating that @entity8 stars are four times more likely to be injured in the last three months of the campaign than those elsewhere			0
with so many matches being played -- and at such physical intensity -- perhaps player burnout is inevitable before a major championship such as @entity24 even starts			1
but is it ? what if coaches and medical staff had a way of tracking players ' fitness , allowing them to be rested before injury occurs ? one leading sports scientist , dr. @entity33 , has come to the conclusion that soft - tissue injuries -- such as those suffered by @entity38 's @entity37 and @entity39 -- can be prevented if players wear global positioning systems ( gps ) during matches			1
a satellite - based positioning system owned by the @entity46 @entity45 , gps can measure how intensely players are working by tracking their position on the field			2
a study of two international rugby union players , which was published in 2011 , concluded that " gps data provides important performance indicators , assists in the development of conditioning and training protocols , as well as injury management			1
" in @entity59 , where @entity33 is based , the tool is permitted in rugby league and rugby union as well as australian rules football			1
however , according to football 's ruling body @entity67 , " gps systems are not a part of the players ' basic equipment " -- even though the system is used by clubs and international teams in training			1
however , arguably it might be in @entity67 's financial interest to permit the use of @entity42 given that it recently committed $ 75 million to an insurance policy to pay clubs a maximum annual payout of $ 9.7 million per player injured while on national team duty , with clubs paid a daily maximum of $ 27,000 a player			1
" football needs to legalize its use to enhance player welfare , " @entity33 , who is head of human performance at soccer club @entity85 , told @entity0			1
" it 's in the interest of clubs , fans , players and the game itself that we do everything possible to maximize the performance of the player while doing our best to minimize the risk of injury			2
" half the size of a mobile phone , a gps unit can be comfortably worn on the upper back by players			2
@entity33 wants @entity67 to allow the use of @entity42 to enable managers to track how their players are coping -- and if they are working too hard , to replace them			1
" we have substituted players in preseason when these numbers start getting outside normal zones and also to monitor loads in training to ensure injuries are prevented , " said the @entity59			0
@entity33 believes @entity42 has played an important role in significantly reducing injuries at @entity85			1
" as with any prevention initiatives it 's hard to say how much we have prevented but i will say we have reduced injury rates at my club by over 60 % this year due to careful monitoring			2
" if we could use it in games i do think we could prevent more as many injuries are fatigue related			0
however i also realize many managers would not make subs based on this			0
" his fears are backed up by the head of fitness and conditioning at @entity38 club @entity134			0
@entity135 -- another @entity59 -- remains unconvinced by @entity33 's argument , insisting that analysis systems such as @entity138 provide more than enough data during the week to measure players ' workload			2
" i 'm not sure you would ever get to the stage where a coach would make a substitution based on a player 's workload -- and i 'm in the coach 's camp on that one , " said @entity135			0
he also believes here could also be reliability problems with @entity42 because major stadiums like @entity154 might interfere with the satellite signal			1
question marks have also been raised about @entity42 accuracy and variability , but @entity33 insists that if you are aware of the error range and it is consistent , you will be able to know when a player is outside their desired limits " i have used it in a number of stadiums without issue and it is used every week in @entity59 rules , rugby union and rugby league , " he said			1
exercise physiologist @entity171 , who is working with the @entity173 national team during @entity24 , believes as many as 80 % of injuries are preventable			1
he has long argued that fatigue due to overtraining is the cause			0
the @entity178 recently published a study demonstrating that teams playing every three days are substantially disadvantaged by player fatigue			2
the study , which looked at 27,000 matches , showed that teams playing after just two days ' recovery against opponents who had enjoyed at least a three - day gap were found to be 39 % less likely to win at home and 42 % less likely to win away			2
where both teams had just two days ' rest , the away team suffered more , showing a 26 % reduced likelihood of victory			0
the @entity67 insurance program starts after the @entity195 in @entity3 and @entity4 , with @entity2 providing insurance for the 16 - team event and all national team matches involving players who play in @entity2 until september 1			1
part of @entity33 's reasoning is based on his belief that not enough money is being spent on protecting on a club and country 's most valuable assets -- the players			2
" i 've seen estimates that the total @entity8 wage bill is $ 2 billion and i would say less than 1 % of that is spent on maintenance of these players through the use of sports medicine and sport science , " @entity33 told @entity0			1
" it 's just not good business			0
people spend a greater percentage on maintaining a $ 30,000 car but for some reason commonsense thinking is removed in professional sport			0
" @entity225 company @entity224 is working with the @entity226 -- a @entity228 firm that has developed a heart - rate analysis product			0
@entity224 's chief executive @entity230 says stressed footballers need to get away from thinking just about training and then playing matches			0
" there is a real area of excitement that people are starting to understand the multiple demands of being an athlete , " said @entity230			0
" it 's not just about the training that you do for 20 hours a week			0
what is the player doing for the other 148 hours of the week ? how are they coping with the demands of travel , media and social relationships ? " so sports teams have the challenge of making sure that athletes take ownership of looking after themselves for 24 hours a day			2
" in fact that is not just true of sports people , it also applies to business people			0
" although @entity67 rules do not permit the use of @entity42 , a spokesman for the world governing body did point out that on page 65 of the laws of the game it states : " a player may use equipment other than the basic equipment provided that its sole purpose is to protect him physically and it poses no danger to him or any other player			1
" all items of clothing or equipment other than the basic equipment must be inspected by the referee and determined not to be dangerous			0
" theoretically that might allow clubs or national federations the scope to request that @entity67 allows players to use @entity42 in a game -- and arguably navigate a route to injury prevention .			1
