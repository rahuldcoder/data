@entity0 , @entity1 -- as much of the country deals with heat waves , the temperature in this coastal city rarely exceeds 75 degrees			0
do n't you want to be in @entity0 ? really ? you might want to re-think that			2
it 's not a good time			0
the circus came to town several weeks ago , and now it refuses to leave			0
one of @entity14 's finest cities is being held hostage			0
what are we supposed to do ? call the mayor ? that wo n't do any good			1
he 's the one holding us hostage			0
@entity24 , national punchline and catnip for late - night talk show hosts , has been accused of sexual harassment , inappropriate touching , lewd comments and other boorish behavior by -- at last count -- 17 women			1
one woman who accused him of making inappropriate comments -- apparently about his sexual stamina -- was a 67 - year - old great - grandmother			1
i had snarkily predicted that we 'd get to 20 women by @entity40			2
now , the way it 's been going , we could hit that figure by the end of business today			0
opinion : no room for lecherous mayors the 70 - year - old is no longer just a weirdo with what he admits is a problem ( he recently underwent what we are assured was intensive behavioral therapy )			0
in recent days , it 's been revealed that he 's a first - class narcissist who wants to lead this city so badly that it is of little concern to him that very few people still want to follow			1
forget that , like most politicians , he rode into office on assurances that he was doing it all to help the less fortunate			0
now we know the truth : it 's all about @entity24			1
most of his supporters have deserted him			0
a new poll shows about 80 % of @entity72 want him to resign			1
a recall effort has begun with volunteers hoping to collect more than 100,000 signatures by september 26			0
and all the while , mayor @entity76 fiddles			2
@entity24 is n't exactly cleaning out his office			1
he does n't seem to care what anyone thinks about him			1
he wo n't leave , and it might just be that -- even with all the pressure being applied -- we ca n't make him leave			2
even if @entity24 is recalled , he 's likely to challenge the legality of the action			1
after all , he could argue , he 's innocent until proven guilty			0
where is his due process ? do n't be surprised if some @entity89 start saying the same thing			1
they 'd like to drag this sordid affair out as long as possible			2
since the beginning of this soap opera by the sea , the loudest voices clamoring for @entity24 to leave have belonged to his fellow @entity96			1
they know what 's at stake			0
@entity100 is a red county that is turning purple as the number of @entity96 grows , thanks to changing demographics			1
@entity24 could drag his party down with him , and send the county back into the @entity89 column for another generation			1
mayor @entity24 's accusers even the @entity111 is ratcheting up pressure on the mayor with a vote on a resolution planned this week calling on him to resign			1
how embarrassing are the @entity24 follies ? try this on for size : @entity120 restaurants in @entity0 have banned the mayor because , according to the management , @entity24 does n't respect women			1
what do you do when you 're deemed morally deficient by a restaurant chain that made a fortune off the concept of waitresses serving up hot wings in tight shorts and cleavage - baring t - shirts ? in @entity24 's case , you go on with business as usual			1
you ignore calls to step down , from the entire @entity136 and a host of elected officials , including sens. @entity139 and @entity140 of @entity1			2
this week , the mayor ducked into a downtown office building for settlement talks with @entity144 , his former communications director , and her lawyer @entity146			0
@entity144 , who was the first woman to publicly accuse @entity24 of wrongdoing , has filed a lawsuit claiming the mayor told her to work without panties , tried to kiss her , told her he wanted to see her naked and put her in a headlock			1
one of the issues still unresolved is just who would pay a settlement if one were reached -- @entity24 or the city ? city officials have made it clear they are n't eager to foot the bill for @entity24 's alleged misbehavior , but they seem to be keeping that door open if it will help get the embattled mayor into an early retirement			1
@entity24 does still have a few supporters			2
this week , several dozen of them staged a protest to try to dissuade people from signing the recall petitions			0
one activist took to the microphone to denounce the " witchcraft , uh , witchhunt " going after @entity24 , who she insisted was a good man and a champion for the downtrodden			2
" he was a @entity177 , " she said			0
" he fought for immigration			0
he is far more than sloppy kisses			0
" out of rehab , but locked out of office and that 's a defender ? have mercy on the hostages			0
great weather notwithstanding , at the moment , it 's hard to imagine that any city in @entity14 is more uncomfortable than this one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity192 : 80 % of @entity72 want embarrassing mayor @entity24 to resign
so far , *16* women accuse @entity24 of sexual harassment , inappropriate touching
@entity192 calls him a narcissist who wants to lead so badly he does n't care no one wants him
he says @entity24 could drag @entity96 down with him , and give county back to @entity89
