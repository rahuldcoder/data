-- well , it was bound to happen			0
the high - tech arms race has escalated once again			2
no , we 're not talking about military weaponry			0
it all started with the radar guns used by police officers to detect speeders			2
we 're talking about the tech - driven cat - and - mouse game between law - enforcement agencies and motorists when it comes to setting and avoiding speed traps			1
it all started , of course , with the radar guns used by police officers to detect speeders			2
then came radar detectors used by motorists who wanted to skedaddle faster than posted speed limits			1
then police began using laser units which are more effective and more accurate than radar guns and so on and so on			2
now , the latest " upgrade " in this ongoing game of high - tech one - upmanship : @entity27			1
@entity27 is a service developed and run by @entity29 of @entity30 , @entity31 , and is essentially a cell - phone social network that allows motorists to hook up with one another for the purpose of issuing real - time alerts about the location of speed traps			1
@entity27 works like this : go to the web site , and sign up for a free membership			1
then download the @entity27 software to your cell phone or pda			1
@entity29 said that most current - generation cell phones , @entity47 and other pda 's can accommodate the @entity27 software			1
then , you 're ready to hit the road			0
and once you 're tooling down the highway , if you spot a state trooper or city cop lying in wait with a radar gun or laser unit , you just need to punch in " pound one " on your cell phone -- or dial a toll - free number			1
other users are then alerted on their cell phones or pda when they approach the same speed trap			1
" one great thing about that is that it 's hands - free , " says @entity29			0
" you do n't have to be looking at the phone or even be holding it to be notified of the speed trap -- which , of course , is safer , because you do n't have to take your eyes off the road to be notified of the trap			1
" the more sophisticated cell phones / @entity71 can also display a map that displays the exact location of the speed trap			1
" but obviously , people should pull over if they 're going to look at the map , " @entity29 added			0
@entity27 was launched in april , and while @entity29 declined to comment on the exact number of subscribers , he did say the site is booming			2
" we 're going crazy , we 've had so many people sign up that it 's been hard to keep up with , " he said			0
" we initially had some capacity issues as a result , so we had to re-do some of the architecture			0
" @entity29 said one thing that surprised him is that " about half of our initial subscribers were soccer moms			0
but , when you think about it , that makes sense , they 're in the car the most , and they take a lot of short trips , driving their kids to and from school , soccer practice , music lessons , etcetera -- so they 're the ones getting the worst tickets , like for driving 53 [ mph ] in a 35 [ mph ] zone			0
those are worse tickets than the ones you get out on the highway because judges show no mercy when it comes to speeding in residential neighborhoods or adjacent surface streets			0
" in may , @entity27 also became integrated with @entity114 , an @entity116 - connected gps device for vehicles that can be mounted on the dashboard			1
@entity27 relies partly on the @entity120 technology provided @entity121 , a @entity122 - based firm that provides positioning services that depend on various @entity120 access points			1
it also relies in part on satellite - based @entity127			0
" the reason that @entity121 is a great partner for us is that , if you have a handset that only has @entity127 , that takes a few minutes after you turn it on before it gets a fix on the location of a speed trap , " says @entity29			0
" but @entity121 's @entity120 technology is instantaneous ; it can tell you immediately if there is a cop with a radar gun in your vicinity			0
" " @entity29 needed to get @entity27 into as many handsets as possible , as many different types of phones and @entity71 as he could , in order to build a large interactive social network , " @entity145 , @entity146 's ceo , explained			1
" a big challenge for a service like @entity27 is that it requires the phone to know its own location			1
so , by integrating our technology , it enabled @entity27 to expand the potential pool of phones they could get service onto			2
" we take advantage of the fact that there are @entity120 access points almost everywhere in populated areas -- homes , offices , @entity171 stores , etc , " @entity145 said			0
" we have crews that go out and survey every street , we 've covered over a million miles of road , which covers 70 percent of the population			0
we 've now mapped over 40 million access points			0
" as mentioned , @entity27 also relies in part on satellite - based gps , but using gps alone is not enough to ensure " total coverage " for a system like @entity27 , @entity145 said			1
" our @entity120 system works in a way that is similar to @entity127 , except that , instead of using satellites , we use the @entity120 signals that permeate through most populated areas			0
@entity127 has some limitations , in that the cell phone manufacturer has to add it to the phone , and @entity127 also does not work as well in crowded urban areas			1
" @entity29 expanded , saying , " what 's also great about @entity27 is that it can work with handsets that have gps , or , it can work with handsets that do n't have gps , because of the @entity120 technology provided by @entity121			2
" one would think that law enforcement would take a dim view of a company / service like @entity27 -- since you could look at it as a service that is enabling speeders to escape detection			2
but both @entity29 and @entity145 point out that the opposite is true			0
" we have a quote on our web site from the @entity212 that states a service like @entity27 is actually a positive , " says @entity29			1
" because , if one driver warns everyone else that there is a speed trap at a certain location , then everyone slows down -- which , after all , is the whole purpose of a speed trap , getting drivers to slow down			2

@entity27 is a cell - phone social network that allows motorists to alert others
users send alerts via cell phone regarding locations of speed traps
in may , @entity27 became integrated with @entity114
police : services like @entity27 actually a positive ; it gets people to slow down
