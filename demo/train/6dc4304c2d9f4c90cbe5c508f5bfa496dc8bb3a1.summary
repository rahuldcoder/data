@entity0 -- @entity3 's campaign can now point to at least one thing it has in common with @entity7 's -- a musical act is asking it to stop using its music at campaign stops			1
the rock band @entity11 this week served @entity3 's campaign with a cease - and - desist order after it says @entity3 's campaign used its song " @entity16 " at an event earlier this month			1
" seems as if the @entity20 is once again whimsically ignoring our great nation 's laws to do whatever it wants to do , and shooting itself in the foot in the process , " band representative @entity18 said in a statement			2
@entity27 against the machine the band 's lead singer and guitarist @entity31 could n't resist making a political point : " we were very close to just letting this go , because the irony was too good			1
while he is inadvertently playing a song that describes his whole campaign , we doubt that ' @entity16 ' really sends the message he intends			1
" a @entity3 spokeswoman , @entity38 , responded to the request , saying , " the song was inadvertently played during event setup before gov. @entity3 arrived at the location			1
" " as anyone who attends gov. @entity3 's events knows , this is not a song we would have played intentionally			1
that said , it was covered under the campaign 's regular blanket license , but we will not play it again , " said @entity38			0
squabbles between artists and campaigns over artistic sensibilities , political compatibility , and rights issues have become as much a political tradition as campaign buttons			2
among the most famous of these is the clash between @entity7 and @entity62			0
during the 1984 campaign , @entity7 told a @entity65 crowd , " @entity67 's future rests in a thousand dreams inside our hearts			1
it rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young @entity67 admire : @entity65 's own @entity62			0
" but @entity7 apparently had n't heard the lyrics			2
" born in the @entity67 , " the song he referred to , was n't a message of hope and pride but of " how this country is going to pot , essentially , and do something about it , " said @entity80 , pop music editor at the @entity81			2
@entity62 later told @entity87 magazine , " i think people have a need to feel good about the country they live in			0
but what 's happening , i think , is that that need -- which is a good thing -- is getting manipulated and exploited			0
you see in the @entity7 election ads on tv , you know , ' it 's morning in @entity67 , ' and you say , ' well , it 's not morning in @entity101			2
' " @entity102 on @entity104 lawsuit @entity62 so much wanted to convey the actual message of his song that he " took to playing ' born in the @entity67 ' on an acoustic guitar so it would n't sound so rousing anymore , " said @entity108 , editor of @entity109 sen. @entity111 's presidential campaign also came under fire for using music from artists who did not support it			1
in 2008 , the band @entity116 asked the campaign to stop playing its song " @entity119 " in honor of vice-presidential candidate @entity122 's nickname on her high school basketball team , " @entity122			1
" the band even went on national television to express its outrage			0
" @entity122 's views and values in no way represent us as @entity67 women , " @entity127 and @entity128 told @entity129			0
" we ask that our song ' @entity119 ' no longer be used to promote her image			0
" @entity111 also settled out of court with @entity138 for using his 1977 hit " @entity142 " in a campaign ad without the artist 's permission			1
@entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 asked @entity111 and other candidates to stop using their music			1
and @entity148 did n't find @entity149 his type of " @entity151			0
" the rocker 's manager asked the @entity149 campaign to stop using his 1977 hit " @entity151 " after it was played during the kickoff event for the @entity159 representative 's presidential bid			2
@entity148 also asked president @entity161 not to use his music during his campaign , the @entity160 reported			1
but those artists were alive to protect their music			0
@entity165 has been co-opted by everyone from dictators to revolutionaries			0
@entity170 's book " @entity171 : a political history " chronicles the symphony 's use in clashing political contexts from @entity176 's birthday , to the deadly protests in @entity179 's @entity178 , to the fall of the @entity181			0
