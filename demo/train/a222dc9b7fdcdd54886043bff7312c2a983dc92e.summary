@entity0 -- president @entity2 hit back at @entity4 governor @entity3 over @entity5 on tuesday , warning that quarantine policies based on fear could discourage @entity9 health care workers " doing @entity11 's work " in @entity12 to battle the epidemic			1
@entity2 issued a veiled but clear public rebuke to the tough - talking @entity15 who strode back onto the national stage in a tussle with the @entity19 on friday after ordering the isolation of a nurse who had just landed at @entity22 from @entity23			0
the president warned that health workers who do a " really tough job " in @entity12 should be applauded , supported and monitored in a prudent fashion once they come back home			0
he said @entity29 precautions should be based on science not " on our fears			0
" the public disagreement marked the latest twist in the odd couple relationship between the cool , no drama president and the no - nonsense governor , who bonded two years ago after @entity38			0
widening disagreements are likely if @entity3 decides to run for president in 2016			1
@entity3 justified his decision to contradict federal @entity5 procedures by quarantining the nurse , @entity44 by saying that the inconveniencing of one person was outweighed by wider concerns for public safety			1
but the confinement of @entity44 , who exhibited no symptoms of @entity5 , stirred a public relations mess for the governor and on monday he relented and allowed her to return home to @entity55 for monitoring			2
another governor , democrat @entity56 of @entity57 also climbed down on tough new quarantine rules under pressure from the @entity19			0
but @entity3 remained defiant on tuesday , saying he had no regrets over how the drama had unfolded in his state			1
the @entity5 episode offers another example of challenges @entity3 faces as the @entity15 governor of a @entity68 state with his eyes on the @entity19			1
he has to avoid alienating conservative primary voters -- many of whom are still bitter about @entity3 's embrace of president @entity2 days before the 2012 election after @entity38 ravaged his state			1
but he ca n't hew so close to the conservative line that he upends his image as a straight - talker willing to take on both parties			0
that dynamic was on display monday after @entity44 was released			0
conservative talk show host @entity82 said @entity3 himself should be quarantined after again lining up with @entity2 on a key issue shortly before a critical election			2
" @entity2 and his gang are flipping out ...			0
so one week before the election , once again gov. @entity3 has caved , " @entity82 said			2
" we need to quarantine @entity3 , is what we need to happen here folks			2
" still , the @entity19 that was once so eager to embrace @entity3 's @entity91 bear hug of @entity2 's leadership is now rebuking the state 's the treatment of @entity44 , saying medical staff returning home must not be stigmatized			1
" her service and commitment to this cause is something that should be honored and respected			0
i do n't think we should do that by making her live in a tent for two or three days , " @entity19 spokesman @entity101 said monday			0
the jab was a reflection of how the political circumstances of both @entity3 and @entity2 have changed since their interactions in the wake of @entity38			0
back then , with @entity3 seeking a thumping re-election win to set up a 2016 run , and keen for federal relief cash , he had sound political reasons to offer @entity2 a disaster photo - op â € ” much to the fury of @entity117 's supporters			1
now , with @entity3 seeking a national stage , polishing his reputation after the @entity123 scandal , and keen to capitalize on @entity15 claims @entity2 is incompetent , it makes sense to stand firm on @entity5			1
@entity125 : the @entity5 epidemic the @entity19 noticed the shifting dynamic from a politician who now has more incentive to confront @entity2 than to embrace him			0
a senior administration official told @entity1 on sunday that the @entity19 told @entity3 and @entity56 it was concerned with " the unintended consequences of policies that are not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat @entity5 at its source in @entity12			1
" the saga reveals two sides of @entity3 â € ” likely to be vying for prominence if he decides next year to run for president in a campaign that will likely contrast his abrasive style of management with the cool , ' no drama ' persona adopted by @entity2 , which critics see as evidence of disengagement			2
" what i think @entity3 did here was he managed once again , just like @entity38 , to reassert himself as a very strong and powerful leader , someone who will seize the bull by the horns , " said @entity150 , an analyst who has watched the governor 's fast rising career from @entity153			2
in standing up to federal health authorities , @entity3 assumed leadership of those suspicious of @entity0 officials who insist their risk to @entity9 from @entity5 is miniscule			1
" being an undeclared candidate in a hotly contested primary ... @entity3 's calling card is going to be that bold leadership â € ” and he is going to show it time and time again , " said @entity167 , a public affairs consultant who runs a daily newsletter on @entity4 politics .			1
