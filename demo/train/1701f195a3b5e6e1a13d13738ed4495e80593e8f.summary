@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity3 and @entity4 approved a resolution tuesday to install the country 's vice president as head of state until ailing president @entity9 recovers enough to resume his duties			1
but the @entity11 , made up of government ministers , must still approve the resolution before vice president @entity14 can become acting president			1
the @entity11 is likely to discuss the matter at a regularly scheduled meeting wednesday			1
the absence of @entity9 , who left @entity1 for medical treatment in @entity21 in november , has created a power vacuum in @entity24 's most populous country , observers have said			1
it also sparked demonstrations in the nation 's capital , @entity29 , where protesters demanded a constitutional order on his absence and evidence about his true state of health			1
but @entity1 's attorney general @entity37 insisted tuesday there has been no power vacuum			1
" the main issue is that there must be ways of resolving our progress constitutionally , " @entity37 told @entity2 's @entity40			1
" the system is working because nobody has taken up arms			0
" he added , " what is important now is to move the country forward ... for the three arms of government to come and support the vice president to carry out his duties			2
" @entity37 's stance was criticized by a @entity57 winner for literature , @entity59 of @entity1 , who accused the attorney general of talking " from all four compass points of his mouth			1
... he 's told so many untruths			1
" @entity59 accused the ruling @entity66 of taking advantage of the president 's absence			1
" the issue is that certain elements within the ruling party love this hiatus , they love the headlessness of government because they can proceed to loot and create their own little empires while the president is away , " he said			2
@entity59 predicted that the @entity66 will not give up its current position easily			0
" they 're going to find other forms of delaying tactics , and i 'm talking about certain criminal elements within the ruling party , " he said			0
" they are the ones really responsible for this			0
" @entity59 added that @entity1 may soon need to embark on a campaign of civil disobedience to stop the @entity66 , which he described as " an illegitimate , unelected , corrupt and murderous party			1
" a failure to implement measures such as electoral reform -- designed to put the country back on a democratic path -- could foment such a campaign , he said			0
" there 's got to be a review , " he said			2
" failing all this , the citizenry will embark on a civil disobedience campaign			0
i see no other course for the nation			0
" @entity59 said such a campaign would begin on a small scale and escalate until " so - called legislators " are made to live up to their responsibilities			0
" it 'll mean a de-recognition of the government to start with , flouting the law wherever possible , " he said			0
" we 've demonstrated that the rallies need not be violent as long as civil rights are not trampled on			0
" the president is being treated for inflammation of tissue around the heart , a condition that was diagnosed in november after he complained of chest pain in @entity29			2
he was taken to @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity21 , where he had undergone his last checkup in august , his doctor said			2
@entity9 said at the time he did not intend to resign while in @entity21 , but no further news came from the president for almost two months until january 13 , when he gave the @entity127 an interview from his hospital bed			1
in a frail voice , @entity9 sought to assure his countrymen that he was getting better and intended to return soon to power			0
@entity1 's @entity4 expressed concern " that there had been no formal communication to the @entity137 " -- as required by the nation 's constitution -- to " empower the vice president to act and perform the functions of the president , " @entity133 reported			1
but @entity37 , the attorney general , has said the president did not need to write such a letter			0
in addition to internal discord over its missing president , the oil - rich nation has faced international heat after one of its citizens allegedly attempted to blow up a @entity154 - bound jetliner on christmas day			0
@entity154 authorities then required passengers on @entity154 - bound flights from @entity1 to undergo enhanced security measures			2
a senior @entity154 administration official said @entity1 fell into the @entity154 @entity161 category of " state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest			2
" @entity2 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 's president has been in @entity21 for medical care since november
@entity3 and @entity4 vote to make @entity174 acting president ; @entity11 must also ok
