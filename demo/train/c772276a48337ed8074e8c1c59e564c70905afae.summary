-- the makers of @entity3 devices , @entity1 , are gearing up for a fight they ca n't afford to lose			1
on wednesday at a press event in @entity7 , the company will finally unveil its new smartphone operating system , @entity3 10 , and a pair of new handsets -- one with a physical keyboard and another that 's all touchscreen			1
but are there enough @entity3 fans left out there to embrace a new kind of smartphone from a company that has fallen woefully behind the competition , both in sales and innovation ? many @entity3 users in the @entity24 are stuck with the device because it is issued by their employer , which has led to a cumbersome trend of people carrying two devices : a work phone and a personal one			1
to succeed , @entity1 must persuade diehard @entity3 fans to upgrade to something radically new			1
@entity3 also must woo corporations by emphasizing security and support features while distinguishing itself from the leading smartphone platforms , @entity40 and @entity41 , and the other new kid , @entity43			1
" they need to get everything absolutely right , from the design of the hardware to the @entity50 ( user interface ) of the hardware to the number of applications to the price of the applications , " said @entity44 , an analyst at @entity45			0
unlike @entity57 , which cut its teeth on @entity59 and sunk huge amounts of money into polishing and marketing @entity43 , the troubled @entity1 needs its new platform to be a success the first time out			1
it has been a rough couple of years for the @entity67 company			0
unable to keep pace with the rich app store selections and slick design of @entity40 and @entity41 devices , @entity1 has hemorrhaged users in the @entity24			1
the company 's public image has suffered , as chunky @entity3 phones became a popular target for mocking by the press and @entity79 owners in coffee shops , bars and meeting rooms			1
a widespread network outage in 2011 did n't help			0
the financial impact was brutal			0
over the course of a year , @entity1 's sales volume dropped 51 % , according to the company 's third quarter 2012 earnings , and in july , @entity1 announced plans to cut 5,000 jobs			1
part of this plunge could be spun as customers waiting for the next generation of @entity3 devices			1
the @entity3 platform was announced in may , along with plans to roll out products by the end of 2012			2
but the date was pushed back , and the company missed out on the lucrative holiday season and corporations ' it planning for 2013			0
" the delay has not helped them			0
corporations that have decided to move away from @entity1 already made that call for 2013			2
" said @entity44 , who believes corporations will be the key to @entity1 's survival			1
real vs. virtual keyboards it 's a different world now than when the first waffle - shaped @entity3 caught on in the early to mid- 2000s			1
at the top of its game , the @entity3 had cachet			2
its users were workaholics , such as high - powered executives and members of @entity122 , and they were adept at composing full - length missives on the small keyboard with one hand while walking and talking			0
but in recent years a new trend has swept many of the large corporations that issued @entity129			0
now many employees bring in their desired devices , usually iphones or high - end @entity41 phones , from home and use them for work instead of taking what 's doled out by the it department			1
@entity1 recognizes that its core customers are highly regulated industries such as government and finance , which have struggled with mobile security issues			2
on wednesday , the company released @entity144 , a device - management system for corporations and government agencies that can support company - issued devices as well as employees ' personal smartphones			1
@entity1 also is promoting another feature , @entity153 , which sets up separate profiles for work and personal apps and data on a single device			2
the brand 's traditional focus on it - friendly support , security and e-mail productivity will likely still appeal to companies			0
but @entity1 also needs to liven up its line of phones with great apps and smart - looking hardware			2
@entity1 still has loyal fans outside it departments , like speed typists hooked on the phones ' physical keyboard			2
the @entity3 was one of the first devices to combine e-mail and a mobile phone in a way that made it possible to do real work			2
for many @entity3 users , that level of productivity was never quite matched by the next generation of touchscreen smartphones , kicked off by the @entity79 in 2007			1
when the first @entity79 debuted , a common criticism was that it could n't be taken seriously as a work device because it did n't have a " real " keyboard			0
there was a sharp learning curve , and typing required getting used to the autocorrect features that were supposed to compensate for stray fingertips			0
eventually the the new school of touchscreen smartphones won out , thanks to powerful features the @entity3 could n't touch , such as stocked app stores , stunning games and full internet browsers			2
the features that appeal to the remaining @entity3 fans are the ones that make the devices good for communicating quickly , like pounding out e-mails on the full qwerty keyboard or using the @entity206 service			2
" @entity1 has always built a device you use 300 times a day for 10 - 20 seconds at a time			2
their goal is to add seconds back into your day , " said @entity211 , editor of @entity212 , a site for @entity3 fans			2
but a new phone that lacks the signature keyboard could be a hard sell for @entity3 fans who have managed to resist the siren song of touchscreen devices			2
" the difficulty is that the people who are left over are the people who are happy with what they have today , " said @entity44			0
what 's coming at wednesday 's launch @entity1 is expected to cover its bases by introducing two devices -- one joining the mainstream with an all - touchscreen display and another keeping the keyboard			1
the release dates for the new products have n't been announced , but @entity211 thinks @entity1 could make a touchscreen phone available first in an attempt to convert the curious keyboard faithful			0
the @entity3 operating system will still emphasize work productivity with a @entity240 feature that collects e-mail and other messages in one spot			1
a voice assistant will do its best @entity246 impersonation , and mobile payments will get a boost with built - in @entity249			0
app selection is another key area that @entity3 must address			0
@entity252 , its online store , has about 100,000 apps , compared to more than 700,000 each for @entity41 and @entity255			0
historically , the company has been known as an inhospitable place for small outside developers			0
but as part of its internal shakeup , @entity1 has drastically revamped its developer relations program			0
led by @entity263 , the group has been actively courting developers ahead of next week 's launch with tools that make it easy to port over @entity41 apps and programs like built for @entity3 , which offer incentives for apps made for the @entity3 platform			1
@entity1 is extending the deadline for the built for @entity277 after it says it received 19,000 submissions			0
@entity263 has stated the company wants to have more apps at kickoff than the other smartphone platforms originally launched with			0
however , many big developers will likely wait to see the initial reaction to @entity3 before sinking money into creating apps for the new system			1
developers might be more optimistic about @entity1 's international potential			1
in @entity291 , where the @entity3 brand has faired slightly better over time than in the @entity24 , carriers still offer extremely competitively priced data plans for the devices , giving the phones an edge with companies that have international business travelers , according to @entity44			0
according to @entity299 , @entity3 is set to battle it out with @entity43 for the no. 3 smartphone operating system worldwide in 2013 , behind @entity41 and @entity255 's @entity40			1
while its grip has slipped in @entity303 , @entity3 has maintained a strong presence in such far - flung places as @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 and some @entity311 countries			0
@entity211 thinks that @entity1 's decision to delay its big @entity3 launch until after @entity43 debuted could yield unexpected advantages			1
" being the newest platform on the block , they can look at what everybody 's doing , what 's good and bad , " said @entity211			0
@entity1 will have to convince existing users that @entity3 and its new phones are worth sticking around for , but those last vestiges of @entity3 's fan base probably wo n't be enough to keep the company afloat			1
the company also must lure back past @entity3 users who have moved on to newer platforms , and present itself as a reinvigorated alternative to @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity43			1
even then , there 's no guarantee it will work			0
said @entity44 , " they can still do everything right and not succeed because of how competitive the environment is out there			0

new @entity3 operating system being unveiled at @entity1 event wednesday
the company must appease its corporate base while winning over @entity41 and @entity40 users
this could be the company 's last *opportunity* to cling to its no. 3 spot in the smartphone market
