-- after thousands of years of civilization , finally @entity1 has @entity3			1
in march , a @entity4 opened in @entity5 , the first @entity1 outpost of the chain			1
about 2,500 people a day have been lining up to try burritos and quesadillas , helped out by employees hired to explain what , exactly , burritos and quesadillas are , according to reports			0
but @entity1 customers are n't just ordering the @entity17 treats known in the @entity19 @entity18 , @entity4 's parent company , came up with a bunch of special menu items designed for local palates : crunchy potato tacos and extra-spicy burritos filled with paneer , the rubbery , fresh @entity1 cheese			1
this move is what people in the trade call product localization : customizing what you 're selling to the people you 're selling it to			0
it 's a crucial strategy in the global fast - food business			1
@entity19 chains are bringing burgers and pizza and chimichangas to @entity41 , but they are also adapting to their new homes , coming up with hybrid foods that the folks back home do n't hear about			1
this is nothing new , of course			0
@entity48 's , which has branches in more than 119 countries , has been customizing its menus for years			2
food court city : how where you live affects what you eat anyone who 's seen " @entity59 " knows that a @entity48 's @entity60 is called a @entity61 in @entity62 , but it 's not just the names that are different			2
@entity62 visitors to the golden arches can get @entity67 , a smaller - size burger with mustard sauce , and they can pair it with a banana caramel shake			1
in the @entity73 , @entity72 serves a @entity74 ( a fried beef croquette on a bun ) ; in @entity77 , it offers shrimp with cocktail sauce			1
the 280 @entity80 is an @entity82 - only burger , designed for sophisticated palates -- you can get one with real @entity86 cheese			1
there 's a burger on pita bread for the @entity91 market ( the @entity91 @entity92 , of course ) , and a @entity94 for @entity95			1
naturally , you can get guacamole on your burger in @entity98 ; you can also order @entity99 -- refried beans and salsa on an @entity103 muffin			2
@entity41 is the fastest - growing market for @entity19 fast food though , and all the chains trying to find a place there are scrambling to come up with new dishes to please local tastes			1
here 's some of what @entity19 may be missing : @entity1 as the @entity4 honchos undoubtedly know , @entity1 is a tricky market for food chains			1
@entity115 do n't eat beef , @entity117 do n't eat pork , and a sizable percentage of the country does n't eat meat at all			0
fried chicken is a relatively safe bet , and @entity124 -- another @entity18 - owned brand -- does a good business in buckets of @entity128 ' original recipe			1
but it also caters to vegetarians with a veg thali , a vegetable - and - rice mixed plate , and the @entity133 , a chickpea burger with @entity135			1
the @entity1 @entity137 menu has the same turkey and tuna sandwiches as in @entity19 stores , but roast beef is nowhere to be found , and the ham is made of chicken			1
and at franchises from @entity146 to @entity147 , you can order a chicken tikka sub or one made from roast lamb			0
when @entity48 's set up shop in @entity1 in 1996 , it ditched beef and introduced the @entity153 @entity92 , originally made with lamb			1
chicken patties are used on the sandwich now , but even more popular is the vegetarian @entity157 , a burger made from potatoes and peas			2
to allay strict dietary concerns , the carnivorous and vegetarian cooking is done separately , by different sets of workers : those cooking the veggie meals wear green aprons ; people handling meat wear red			0
the big fast - food success story is @entity172 , which recently opened its 300th branch in @entity1			1
it manages to please all tastes and honor all restrictions : there 's a corn and black olive pizza for the vegetarians ( the " gourmet " ) and keema do pyaaza topping -- ground lamb and onions -- for meat eaters			2
for a true exotic taste , there 's pepperoni : " 100 percent pork pepperoni , " the online menu promises , rather scandalously			0
@entity192 the leading @entity19 chain in the @entity192 market , @entity124 , offers plenty of dishes that cater to local tastes			1
instead of coleslaw , you can order seasonal vegetables with your chicken : bamboo shoots in spring , lotus root in summer			0
it also offers a traditional breakfast menu featuring congee -- rice porridge -- served with fried crullers or sesame flatbread for dipping			2
@entity48 's , on the other hand , sticks mostly with classic sandwiches			0
after introducing regionally specific items , such as the rice burgers it serves in other @entity41 countries , and trying to compete with @entity124 on the chicken front , it found that its @entity192 customers preferred to order @entity221 foods			1
so it played up the burgers , rolling out a suggestive ad campaign with the slogan " feel the beef			0
" but not everything is exactly the same as it is in the @entity228			0
a version of the @entity60 ( called the @entity230 ) is served with cucumbers rather than pickles and comes with a spicier sauce			0
if you do n't want fries , you can order a corn cup , a side dish that has caught on at other @entity41 branches			1
for dessert , you can choose between pineapple or taro root pies			0
@entity242 for its @entity244 stores , @entity48 's has found that novelty is the way to go , and the company has introduced lots of special menu items			2
you can pair your @entity251 , made from pork , with a bag of @entity255 fries ( add the seaweed powder yourself )			1
you can get a @entity258 or a @entity259			0
probably the most distinctively @entity244 dish is the @entity261 , a fried shrimp patty on a bun ( " ebi " means shrimp in @entity244 )			0
@entity48 's helped popularize the dish by signing up model @entity266 -- nicknamed " @entity268 " -- to do a series of print ads and commercials			0
a few years back , @entity272 introduced the @entity273 , an over-the - top pizza to make all other over-the - top pizzas run away and cower in fear			2
one half ( the " gourmet half " ) was topped with ham , bacon , sausage , tomatoes and garlic			0
the other half was covered with miniature hamburger patties , soybeans and corn			0
sadly , the @entity273 is no longer sold , but that does n't mean @entity272 is boring			0
your topping choices include tuna , fried squid and spicy @entity294 - style beef			2
you also can get the " @entity299 " with potato , corn , bacon and mayonnaise			0
@entity300 @entity301 has made a big splash in @entity300 , popularizing bagels and doughnuts as breakfast treats			0
besides the standard @entity19 glazed and filled versions , it offers red bean and glutinous rice doughnuts as well as sweet potato muffins and a sesame tofu ring			1
there are savory fried croquettes filled with lentil curry or kimchi , spicy pickled cabbage			0
to drink , you can get a hot 12 - grain latte , made from roasted barley , brown rice and other grains .			2
