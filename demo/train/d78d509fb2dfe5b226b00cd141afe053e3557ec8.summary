-- when i heard the news that @entity3 , the first @entity4 woman in space , died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer i was shocked and saddened			1
she was a woman clearly ahead of her time , blazing trails for all of those behind her , showing other women that it was possible to be smart , to care about science and to be an astronaut			2
after her death , it was revealed that she was gay , but it did n't totally surprise me			2
being a lesbian myself , i admit i was proud to learn that such an accomplished @entity4 pioneer and role model was on " our team			0
" some are saying that she let the gay and lesbian community down , that she should have been more visible and should have publicly declared her sexual orientation			1
she could have made a contribution to gay rights			0
she could have inspired many young people struggling with their sexuality			0
but it is n't that easy			2
especially for women like @entity3 and me , who grew up in the ' 50s and ' 60s			1
i retired from the @entity35 in june 2002 as a captain after nearly 30 years of living under " do n't ask , do n't tell " and its predecessor			2
once i retired , i knew that i needed to add my voice to the fight against @entity42 , to be a visible example of a gay service member			0
however , outing myself beyond my close circle of friends was n't easy			1
i was proud of my accomplishments but a big part of me wanted to keep my personal life private			2
in @entity4 : @entity3 as role model in my early career , most of my challenges , like those of @entity3 i suspect , were trying to succeed in what was pretty much a man 's world			1
no , @entity3 was n't in the military -- but being a part of @entity60 had many similarities			1
i can see why she wanted to focus on succeeding as a woman , which was difficult enough , and did n't want to complicate things by bringing up her sexual orientation			1
more science news from @entity0 @entity67 she carried the burden of being the first @entity4 woman to go into space and all that it meant , and back then , she faced some pretty laughable questions			0
one was whether the flight would affect her reproductive organs			0
former astronaut @entity75 , who was co-pilot on the @entity77 mission with @entity3 , recalls another : a reporter asked : " do you think you will cry during the flight ? " and she answered : " why does n't @entity75 get asked that question ? " there is still a long way to go			1
for example , @entity3 's partner of 27 years , @entity85 , will not receive her federal survivor 's benefits because it is prohibited by the @entity90			1
still , a lot has changed rather quickly for the better			0
@entity42 has been repealed , and gays and lesbians are serving openly and successfully in the military			0
marriage equality is beginning to take hold in several states , and campaigns such as the " @entity100 " project are trying to send a message that it really is ok to be @entity102			0
opinion : a friend remembers @entity3 could @entity3 have come out publicly before her death ? yes			2
but we should respect her choice to keep her personal life relatively private			0
perhaps , if she had been fortunate to have lived a little longer , she might have decided that giving up some of her privacy was worth it to let people see her as an @entity4 hero who " happened to be a lesbian			0
" i know thousands of @entity102 kids might have been encouraged to learn @entity3 was gay -- but we need to remember that those of us who grew up in the ' 50s and ' 60s , when many of us did n't even know what gay meant , are still on a journey of self - acceptance			1
i still marvel at so many young gay and lesbian kids when i see how accepting they are of themselves and how their straight peers accept them as " normal			0
" although i am retired and @entity42 is gone , i still hesitate to share i am a lesbian and am still surprised when people are totally fine with it			0
opinion : thank you , @entity3 let 's remember @entity3 as a courageous pioneer and @entity4 hero			1
let 's not let the fact that she did n't publicly come out to the world detract in any way from her remarkable accomplishments			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			2

@entity3 kept her sexual preference a secret during her lifetime
some say @entity3 should have come out , @entity142 says , but it was n't easy in her *generation*
@entity142 : when @entity3 and she grew up , being a woman in a man 's world was hard enough
@entity142 : ride should be remembered for her remarkable life , not for her orientation
