-- at an age when most pensioners are winding down their lives , @entity1 began a new one			1
in his late 80s , and feeling " more dead than alive " following the loss of his wife and one of his sons , he took up marathon running			1
now 102 , he has become an unlikely celebrity despite a birth defect that prevented him being able to walk until the age of five			1
" @entity17 showed me kindness and brought me back to life by making me forget all my traumas and sorrows , " he told @entity0 's human to @entity16			2
" when i took up running , it was like meeting @entity24 himself			2
i have been running ever since			2
" with his distinctive flowing grey beard and the traditional @entity28 headgear that has earned him the nickname " the @entity30 , " @entity1 has been a star entrant at marathons all over the world			1
it is a far cry from his humble upbringing in @entity36 , which despite its village tranquillity was also a test for the young @entity1 -- who was unable to walk until he was five due to weakness in his legs			1
" it took me another five years to gain strength and become strong			2
by age 10 i was living a normal life , " he recalls			2
while many older people suffer bodily deterioration , @entity1 said tests done when he was 94 showed his left leg had the bone density of a 35 - year - old and his right leg that of a 25 - year - old			1
" my response was , i knew my left leg was weak , " he smiles			2
as he says later : " life is a waste without humor -- living is all about happiness and laughter			2
" more medical tests done when he was 99 " showed that i was a man of 40 years of age			0
" @entity1 grew up in a village in the @entity65 district of the north - western @entity67 state along with his four brothers and sisters and their parents			1
" one does n't know about life 's complexities at that age			0
whatever means one has always seems to be enough , " he said			0
" life was good because we had land and animals ... there was no stress			0
" @entity1 now lives in @entity81 , the @entity82 's bustling capital city , having finally made it his home in the 1990s after several trips to @entity82			1
" after my wife died and when i suffered another tragedy -- the loss of my son -- i came here for two years but i did n't like it as my mind was still in @entity36			1
eventually i had to come to terms with it , " he said			0
" then i took up running -- eventually i was able to overcome my sadness			0
" @entity1 started out competing over shorter distances -- from 100 meters up -- but was convinced to try for the 26 miles and 385 yards that makes up a marathon			1
" i had run a @entity100 but i could n't tell the difference between a kilometer and a mile -- i thought i had done 20 miles so i thought i could do the other six quite easily , " he said			2
" then i met @entity105 ( @entity1 , his longtime coach and mentor ) , he trained me in a couple of months to run the full distance -- and then i was 89 years old			1
" @entity1 's fastest time is the five hours and 40 minutes he took to run the 2003 @entity110 at the age of 92			1
eight years later he returned to the @entity113 event to become the first marathon centenarian , this time clocking more than eight hours			2
it was not accepted by @entity117 ' rule - keepers due to his lack of a birth certificate , although he did produce a letter from @entity82 's @entity121 congratulating him on his 100th birthday			1
just days earlier he had set five world records for his age group in the space of a few hours in events from 100m to 5,000m at a @entity128 meeting in @entity129			0
as well as soothing his soul , running has also brought @entity1 unexpected fame -- he appeared in an @entity134 advertising campaign along with soccer superstar @entity135 and boxing legend @entity136 in 2004			1
" i was really , really happy as i did n't even know who these people were before that , " he said			0
most of @entity1 's marathons were charity fundraisers , in line with his @entity28 beliefs			1
" there are two noble things in life : one to do charity and other to look after your body , " he said			0
" this includes the high principles outlined by my religion , to earn an honest living and to share your means with those less fortunate			0
" i am inspired by honest people who do n't cheat others			0
to me the famous are those who are kind to fellow human beings and dedicate their life to charity			0
" and it is religion that helps him keep going when he hits the dreaded " wall " during a race -- he experiences the transcendental effect of such exercise that was so eloquently documented by @entity169 author @entity168 in his book " @entity171			0
" " the first part of the run is when i am quite cheerful ; my heart is singing a song and dancing seeing the different colors of life , " @entity1 said			1
" when i get really tired , i start chanting @entity24 's name : ' @entity181 , @entity181			0
' " @entity17 also makes people more spiritually aware and in - tune with their inner self			2
a retired marathon runner will still retain all these qualities			2
" and having become the world 's oldest marathon runner , @entity1 is indeed now retired			1
his final race was the 10 - kilometer event ahead of february 's @entity191 marathon , after which he took the advice of his family and @entity194			1
" i have retired because given my age , my body has deteriorated a bit , but retirement has n't slowed me down , " he said			0
" i lead a very active and healthy life			0
i walk for three to four hours a day , play with kids and do all my day - to - day chores myself			1
i might have continued to run for another year but i realized i had to eventually retire one day			1
" a strict vegetarian ( he appeared in a campaign by animal rights group @entity204 ) @entity1 describes himself as " an illiterate person " -- this interview was translated from @entity207 with the help of his coach			1
while he lives a simple life -- in bed by 10 p.m. after relaxing listening to @entity212 , and up again by 6 a.m. -- he does admit to one guilty pleasure : shopping			0
" though i am an old man now , i am still very particular about my personal style			0
i love shopping for suits and shoes -- i keep looking for the latest and best available , " @entity1 said			1
" i do n't have many expenses but i do spend often on new suits and shoes even though i have a lot of them			0
" running shoes , in particular , remind him of the happiness he has discovered			0
" i am very fond of my running shoes , i absolutely love them			0
i wear them for pleasure			0
i ca n't imagine my life without them			0
