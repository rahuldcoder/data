@entity1 , @entity0 -- this week the who 's who of the @entity5 rubbed shoulders at a @entity8 dinner			1
business people talked deals , swapped business cards and rubbed shoulders with government elite -- in @entity14			1
sheikh @entity15 with @entity14 premier @entity16 the @entity14 government invited sheikh @entity18 on an official visit to the country			1
the ruler responded by arriving with an entourage of 50 business leaders and throngs of government support -- an obvious symbol of the importance the @entity5 has put on growing relations with @entity14			1
" @entity14 is a booming market			2
we 're here exploring opportunities with @entity14 government entities as well as @entity14 private sector companies , " said @entity31 ceo of sustainable energy company , @entity32			2
the @entity37 and @entity38 arguably identified the exploding opportunities in @entity14 15 years ago and , in fact , make up the bulk of the investment into the country			0
compared with the huge amounts of dollars pouring in from these countries , @entity45 nations do relatively little business in @entity14			1
@entity49 has mostly centred on oil imports coming out of the @entity51 and cheap @entity14 goods coming into the region from the other direction			0
@entity55 , trade between the two countries reached $ 19 billion last year and the @entity5 is keen to strengthen and diversify ties with the booming @entity14 economy by investing in areas like finance , real estate and construction			1
" @entity14 , @entity64 , the @entity5 are considered fast growing emerging markets			1
so , what it is , is we have to see what are the niche markets and some growth where we can complement each other rather than compete , " @entity66 , the @entity5 minister of foreign trade told @entity2			0
@entity73 is chairman of @entity74 , the @entity76 government 's powerful holding company which supervises a portfolio of businesses -- including the third largest ports operator in the world , @entity79			2
the company is looking at investing in @entity14 and considers real estate and finance attractive investments , according to @entity73			0
" we would like to do business in a sector we are familiar with			0
we 're big in real estate			0
we also look at the financial sector because we have a merger with a mortgage company in @entity76			0
we are investing in financial institutions , " he said			0
@entity73 thinks that in today 's climate it is easier to invest in the @entity95 than the @entity96 : " we are concentrating in @entity14 , concentrating in @entity100 , because these are places where they 're hungry for capital and there is growth potential , " he said , " the officials in the @entity95 are encouraging while the officials in the @entity96 are creating noises unnecessarily			2
so , naturally , people will look at more investment in the @entity95 , " he continued			0
to drive home the @entity5 's interest in doing business with @entity14 , @entity108 met with @entity14 president @entity112 in @entity113			1
he also oversaw the signing of a private investment deal between telecommunications firm , @entity116 announcing plans to set up a research center with a @entity14 partner , @entity120			1
the two companies have been working together for about five years but getting things done in @entity14 is still far from easy , according to @entity116 ceo , @entity123 : " at the beginning of our relationship with @entity120 , there was a communication issue			1
but that has been overcome			0
with others , we have to approach different people to get a decision made			0
so , in business , time is the most valuable thing and we do n't have time to waste , " he said			0
very few of the @entity5 delegation have any experience working with the @entity14 , which is why the government is conducting a seminar especially for @entity108 's executives on the basics of doing business in @entity14			1
they hope the lessons which include talking about the country 's laws and business culture will help any future business collaborations to go smoothly			2
the @entity14 are working to bridge the cultural gap too			0
" we tell @entity14 companies to be careful of eating pork and drinking alcohol in the @entity5 , to learn @entity156 and @entity157 and not to sell fake goods			2
@entity14 firms are still finding their way , " @entity160 , general manager of state - owned investment company , @entity159 @entity14 and the @entity5 are certainly building closer ties and striving for more profitable partnerships			1
