at a news conference in @entity24 , @entity25 , on monday , after @entity11 announced her selection , @entity7 said she wanted to " thank my fellow @entity26 who have , for eight years , given me the joy of a job i love with the opportunity to work on issues i care deeply , in a state that i cherish			1
" @entity7 added that " leaving the @entity10 is very difficult for me			2
" the task of choosing a successor falls to @entity35 , @entity3 's @entity36 governor			2
whomever he picks would serve for two years , before a special election in november 2010 to decide who fills the last two years of @entity7 's term			1
@entity35 has a strong bench to choose from			0
there are a number of contenders , including at least eight members of @entity3 's delegation in the @entity46 , @entity3 state attorney general @entity47 , @entity49 mayor @entity48 , @entity51 president @entity50 , @entity53 executive @entity52 , @entity54 , and her cousin , @entity55 " this is not an election			1

in an op - ed column last week in the @entity87 , journalists @entity83 and @entity85 urged @entity35 to " send @entity7 to the @entity10			1

he died a few months after taking office			0
@entity7 would bring gravitas to the job , and he obviously knows his way around @entity93			0
