editor 's note : @entity2 is director of the @entity3 at @entity4 , @entity4			2
@entity5 is the director of the @entity6 and @entity7 in the @entity8 at @entity9			2
both have testified before @entity11 in support of federal hate crime legislation and are co-authors of a book on hate in @entity17 , due to be published next year			1
@entity2 says a new federal hate crime law is needed to combat violent incidents of bias			1
@entity21 , @entity22 ( @entity23 ) -- @entity17 needs a coordinated and multifaceted response to combat the continuing scourge of violent hate crime like the crime committed at the @entity28 on june 10			1
the @entity29 , originally introduced by sen. @entity30 a decade ago and nearly passed during the most recent legislative session , is expected to go before the @entity32 for a vote soon			2
@entity17 attorney general @entity34 testified on its behalf thursday before the @entity36			0
it is a crucial step in the nation 's evolving response to hate crime			1
a hate crime occurs when an individual intentionally targets a victim or their property because of his or her actual or perceived race , color , religion , national origin , ethnicity , gender , gender identity , disability or sexual orientation			1
while some have argued that these kind of laws criminalize free speech , the @entity17 @entity61 unanimously ruled in the 1993 case , @entity62 , that well - drafted hate crime laws are constitutional and do not punish speech			1
rather they enhance the penalties only for acts that are already considered crimes			2
the act is named for @entity68 , a 21 - year - old gay college student who was kidnapped , robbed , tortured and left to die , tied to a fence in a remote area outside of @entity71 , @entity72 in october 1998			2
his mother @entity73 has been a tireless advocate for hate crime laws and victims			1
the @entity76 remedies legal loopholes in federal and state criminal law that fail to protect against bias - motivated attacks based on such characteristics as sexual orientation , gender , gender identity and disability			2
it also removes antiquated " klan era " language that forces federal prosecutors to tie violent racial attacks to a small number of activities such as participating in a jury , voting or using hotels			0
as recent events have indicated , today 's violent hate offenders , unlike their predecessors , will often swing into brutal action on their own initiative without waiting for a victim to exercise a specific activity covered by old 1960s laws			2
however , much of the act 's potency lies not in what it punishes , but rather in its recognition of the primary role local authorities now play in combating hate crime			1
nearly all hate crime investigations and prosecutions in the @entity17 are handled by state and local authorities , such as the @entity118 or @entity119 , @entity120			1
gone are the days where masses of federal agents and soldiers had to swoop into states to protect new students and freedom riders from thugs in @entity131 - dominated municipalities			0
the act has a clear bias in favor of local prosecution and has restrictions that require federal prosecution only in limited cases where the leadership of the @entity140 approves			2
however , reporting data indicates that some states apparently provide limited assistance to hate crime victims			1
these jurisdictions report either zero hate crimes or a handful of crime to the @entity149 , year after year , while neighboring states with similar demographics and crime profiles report far more			1
a 2005 @entity154 victimization study found that only a small fraction of hate crimes nationally are actually reported			1
thus , there appear to be various instances where federal help or prosecution are still necessary			0
today , in the midst of our economic downturn , federal authorities are needed much more to assist cash - strapped local departments , not as an unwelcome occupying force , but as a desperately needed partner to assist with forensics , technical assistance and investigations			0
even in police departments with model hate crime investigative units , such as the @entity118 's @entity174 , modern cases increasingly involve interstate travel or internet hate networks , and require sophisticated ballistic and dna testing or computer forensics			1
these measures may be beyond the capacity of many local police agencies , particularly in difficult economic times			0
the act also provides greater access to local communities for federal training programs and mediation services that can prevent hate crimes before they boil over into violence			1
our research has established that hate crimes are a qualitatively unique category of offenses			1
compared to non-bias motivated crimes these crimes are more likely to involve violence , injury , hospitalization , psychological trauma and a greater risk of retaliatory attacks , which can often spill across municipal borders			0
and while we can not say whether hate crimes overall are actually increasing , there does appear to be an increase in the most violent hate crimes			1
in 2007 , hate - motivated homicides claimed nine lives , up from three in 2006 , and the last year has seen a steady stream of violent plots and attacks against symbolic targets by hardened hate - mongers			0
since the beginning of the year we have seen many examples of extremist crimes			0
here are a few : @entity218 , @entity219 : january 21 -- white supremacist @entity220 22 , allegedly kills two , rapes one , and shoots another while en route to a synagogue to kill @entity224			0
@entity225 , @entity226 : february 26 -- @entity227 , 60 , a man known for anti-immigrant rantings , allegedly shoots 5 , killing two @entity230 immigrants			0
@entity231 , @entity232 : april 5 -- neo-nazi @entity233 , 22 , agitated over the belief that president @entity236 would ban guns , allegedly kills three police officers during a domestic violence call			0
@entity240 : may 20 -- four @entity242 converts are arrested on federal charges relating to a plot to bomb @entity224 and military targets			0
@entity246 , @entity247 : may 30 -- leaders of the @entity249 allegedly kill a 29 - year - old @entity251 man and his nine - year - old daughter in an attempt to steal drugs and money to finance their civilian border patrol group			0
@entity119 : june 10 -- holocaust denier @entity257 , 88 , allegedly kills a security guard at the @entity28			0
two national research reports released last week document a disturbing level of supremacist activities and overall violence against a broad range of groups			0
another report from the @entity267 counted a record number of 926 hate groups in the @entity17 last year			0
but there is something more to hate crime 's harms that can not be completely captured by statistics or criminological studies			1
as the @entity28 attack demonstrates , hate crimes threaten pluralistic democracies in a way that other crimes do not			1
unlike many other crimes , they are at once discriminatory and terroristic			0
as law professor @entity291 observed : " the effect of @entity284 on @entity285 was greater than the sum of the damage to buildings and assaults on individual victims			0
" violence and threats that destabilize the bonds between citizens and the democratic institutions that they share are worthy of additional punishment and federal assistance			0
moreover , victims of hate - motivated violence are entitled to legal protection no matter where they reside			2
that is why over two - thirds of the @entity17 public favor hate crime laws , and why the @entity32 should heed their call to pass the @entity76			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity5 .			2

@entity2 , @entity5 : @entity32 to vote on @entity68 hate crime bill
they say loopholes in existing laws require new legislation
they say bill would provide federal help to localities fighting hate crime
@entity2 , @entity5 : hate crimes target pluralistic societies along with victims
