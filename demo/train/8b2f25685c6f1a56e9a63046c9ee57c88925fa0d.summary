editor 's note : a renowned chef and restaurateur , @entity3 - born @entity2 is perhaps best known in the @entity6 for his television show " @entity8			1
" he writes here about witnessing domestic abuse as a child and what he 's doing now to make sure others do n't witness the same			1
he will appear on " @entity14 " tonight at 9 et. chef @entity2 writes of seeing his father abuse his mother ; today @entity2 fights domestic abuse			1
@entity18 , @entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- no child should ever have to live in fear in their own home			0
a home should be a place where you feel safe and loved ; when i was a kid , our home was anything but that			0
growing up , my father was less than a perfect role model			2
i watched how he battled alcoholism and how he became terribly violent with my mum , to the point where she feared for her life			2
every time he got violent , any present that my brother , sisters , or i had given mum would be smashed , simply because he knew it belonged to her			0
there were instances when the police were called to take him away ; mum was taken to the hospital while we kids were taken to a children 's home			2
as kids , my brother , sisters and i moved around to more homes and schools than i can remember			0
@entity58 would often have a fallout with someone at work and get fired , and because our home often came with his job , we would become homeless and have to move again			0
to this day , i will never understand why mum stayed with him			0
she deserved so much better and so much more ; it still pains me to remember how badly he treated her			0
i have four young children of my own , and i could never see myself behaving the way my father did when i was a child			2
i want to be a role model for my children and have them look up to me			0
with that said , my wife , @entity74 , and i are proud to be ambassadors of women 's aid , a national charity in @entity79 working to end domestic violence against women and children			1
women 's aid helps more than 320,000 women and children every year			1
it also supports more than 500 domestic and sexual violence services across @entity79			1
domestic violence is not identified solely by violent physical abuse ; instead , it is defined as physical , sexual , psychological , financial , or emotional violence that takes place in a relationship , intimate or family - oriented			1
eventually , this develops into a pattern of coercive and controlling behavior			0
the statistics are staggering : 1 in 4 women in the @entity100 experience domestic violence in their lifetime , and between 6 - 10 percent of women suffer from domestic violence in a given year			1
the problem is , less than half of these incidents are reported to the police			2
and even still , a phone call is made to the police every single minute in the @entity100 to report a case of domestic violence			1
that means police receive an estimated 1,300 calls each day and more than 570,000 each year , according to women 's aid			1
i encourage everyone to help take a stand against domestic violence			1
my wife , @entity74 , and i ran the @entity120 for women 's aid for the past two years			1
as ambassadors , we are pleased to say that we have received more than £ 5,000 in donations from friends , well - wishers and supporters of the charity			0
just last week , @entity74 and i hosted a fundraising dinner and auction for women 's aid in @entity132 in @entity133 , which helped raise more than £ 475,000 , more than double our original target for the evening			2
my father passed away in 1997 after a long battle with alcoholism			0
these days , my mum is still my biggest supporter -- she remains there by my side through everything , and for that , i am forever grateful			0
