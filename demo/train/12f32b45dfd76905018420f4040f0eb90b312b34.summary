-- @entity1 filed a complaint against the federal government thursday , seeking compensation for what she called its failures to track the man who held her captive for 18 years			1
the lawsuit was filed thursday morning in the @entity11 for @entity12			0
this comes after the @entity15 government " summarily rejected " two requests from @entity17 " for private mediation in the case , " according to a press release from @entity21 and associates , a @entity24 - based public relations firm that represents the long - time kidnap victim			1
the @entity26 had no immediate comment thursday , as it had not seen and thus did not know the details of the complaint , said spokesman @entity30			0
@entity17 was 11 years old in 1991 , when she was abducted from the street in front of her @entity33 , @entity12 , home			1
@entity35 and @entity1 held her and the two daughters she gave birth to in subsequent years in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until they were found in 2009			1
@entity1 was convicted in the 1970s of kidnapping a 25 - year - old woman and keeping her in a storage shed in @entity43 , @entity44 , where he repeatedly raped her			2
he spent 11 years of his sentence in a @entity50 , @entity51 , federal penitentiary , then went to a halfway house and eventually was allowed to live with his mother at her @entity54 , @entity12 , home			2
the federal government oversaw @entity1 's parole from when he got out of custody in 1988 through 1999 -- including the date in 1991 when @entity17 was kidnapped -- after which responsibility shifted to @entity12 authorities			1
" for nearly the entirety of their lives , ... @entity17 and her two daughters were held captive , abused and irreparably damaged by a deranged and maniacal felon , @entity1 , " the complaint begins			1
the court document sharply criticizes the federal government for releasing @entity1 originally from prison in 1988 as well for what it calls its " outrageous and inexcusable " handling of his case			1
" had federal parole authorities demonstrated a modicum of vigilance -- indeed , had they simply performed their duties and obligations as required by federal law and internal policies -- @entity83 and her daughters would not have been forced to endure a virtual lifetime of physical and mental abuse from a detonated ' time bomb , ' " the complaint states			1
no specific damages are requested in the complaint , and @entity17 " is not seeking money for herself " -- as any funds would go to her non-profit @entity90 , which gives support and services to families recovering from abductions and other traumatic services -- said the press release			2
" we believe that the years of abuse experienced by ms. @entity17 are a direct result of the @entity15 parole commission 's colossal blunders in the supervision of mr. @entity114 , " @entity100 , part of the law firm of @entity100 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , which filed the complaint on behalf of @entity17 , said in a statement			1
a $ 20 million settlement was paid out in 2010 from the state of @entity12			0
the press release on @entity17 's behalf notes those funds were shared between her and her children , as well as used for legal and other expenses			1
moreover , it states " the two governmental entities " -- meaning the state and federal governments -- " committed separate , distinct and consecutive acts of negligence			0
" this past april , the @entity129 pleaded guilty in @entity130			0
a judge sentenced @entity1 to 431 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 12 counts of sexual assault			2
@entity1 got 36 years to life in prison for her role in the crimes , including kidnapping and one count of rape by force			2
a few months later , in july , @entity146 -- the chief federal judge for northern @entity12 , thus putting him in charge of the probation department there -- released a once - confidential report from the @entity152 of the @entity153 on @entity114 's case			0
it found no evidence that federal officers charged with overseeing @entity114 over the years would have found @entity17 by searching the premises			1
still , the report called the handling of his case " clearly substandard " and symptomatic of larger problems			0
" the @entity114 case is a significant reflection of the deficient practices in the probation office in the northern district of @entity12 , " the report said			0
" the office had a track record of inadequate supervision ( and ) serious deficiences in operations			0
" after arriving in @entity54 , @entity114 was " correctly categorized as a ' high risk ' offender , ( but ) the probation office failed to supervise him accordingly			0
" the @entity175 said the case 's poor management was unsurprising , as the same federal agency had concluded in 2000 that the northern @entity12 probation office 's supervision of sex offenders was " poor			0
" @entity0 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

new : abuse is *due* to " the @entity15 parole commission 's colossal blunders , " a lawyer says
federal authorities oversaw @entity1 's parole between 1988 and 1999
he and his wife abducted @entity1 in 1991 and held her 18 years
