-- @entity1 was 8 - months - old when he was last spotted alive at a @entity3 motel in late 2009			1
almost three years later , his disappearance is still a mystery			2
and a trial that gets underway this week may finally provide some answers to what happened			2
jury selection begins wednesday in the trial of @entity12 's mother , @entity11 , who is charged with kidnapping , custodial interference and child abuse in the case			1
on december 17 , 2009 , a judge awarded @entity1 and @entity18 , the boy 's father , joint custody of @entity12			1
but @entity1 allegedly defied the ruling and set out for @entity3 with her son			0
@entity18 did n't hear from @entity1 until several days later , when she reportedly sent him a text message saying she 'd killed @entity12 and put his body in a dumpster			1
" i killed him , " @entity1 said in a text to @entity18 on december 27 , 2009			1
" u will never see @entity12 again , i made sure of that			1
and you can spend the rest of ur pathetic life wondering about him			0
" the scathing series of texts continued			1
" u will never find me im already bording a plane			0
out of the country , " @entity1 said			0
" when im safe ill email u the exact location of dead gabriels little blue body			0
if the garbage do n't come first			0
" @entity18 also recorded a phone call from @entity1 in which she made similar claims			0
@entity1 : " you made me do this			0
" @entity48 : " you did not hurt @entity12			1
" @entity1 : " yes , i did			0
i suffocated him and he turned blue			0
and i put him in his diaper bag and i put him in the trash can			0

@entity1 was arrested on december 30 , 2009 , in @entity57 , @entity58			2

@entity1 and @entity66 had met in june 2009 , when both women were waiting for the same flight in the @entity70 airport			2
@entity66 suggested to the young mother that she and her husband adopt @entity12			1
@entity1 said she called @entity73 that december to ask if the couple was still interested			0
this may , @entity66 was found guilty of forgery and conspiracy to interfere with @entity12 's custody			1
in july , she was sentenced to probation and 30 days in jail			0

the defendant addressed the court at the time , admitting that she helped @entity1 and helped care for @entity12 for nine days			1
