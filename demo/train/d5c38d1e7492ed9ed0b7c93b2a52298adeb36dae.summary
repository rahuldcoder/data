@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 says it has ordered a controversial bishop who denies the @entity5 to " distance himself " from his views " in an absolutely unequivocal and public manner			1
" in the interview , @entity9 denied the @entity11 had used gas chambers at concentration camps			1
the @entity3 has been under fire since pope @entity15 lifted the excommunication of bishop @entity9 almost two weeks ago , days after @entity17 broadcast an interview in which @entity9 said the @entity11 had not systematically murdered 6 million @entity19 during @entity20 @entity21 wednesday blasted the rehabilitation of @entity9			1
" the reinstatement of a @entity5 denier by the @entity3 offends every jew , in @entity21 and around the world , and humiliates the memory of all holocaust victims and survivors , " the @entity23 said in a statement			2
it said the @entity34 's distancing itself from @entity9 's position was " the first step in the right direction " and said it expected " more explicit and unequivocal decisions and statements on this issue			0
" @entity21 's statement appears to have been made before the @entity3 's secretary of state , cardinal @entity42 , said @entity9 would not be allowed to perform priestly functions if he did not recant			0
@entity9 's position on the holocaust is " absolutely unacceptable and firmly rejected by the @entity15 , " @entity42 said			1
he added that @entity9 's views on the holocaust " were unknown to the holy father at the time of the excommunication 's remission			2
" @entity9 was rehabilitated on january 21 along with three other members of the ultra-conservative @entity53 the move was announced three days later			2
@entity42 's order comes only two days after he declared the matter " closed			0
" " the @entity53 has distanced itself from its bishop and apologized to the pope for this embarrassing incident			0
the pope spoke clearly on wednesday ( january 28 )			0
i think the question can be considered closed , " @entity42 , said , according the @entity62 daily @entity61 tuesday			0
but on tuesday , @entity65 chancellor @entity64 demanded that the pope firmly reject denial of the @entity5			1
earlier on wednesday , a @entity65 district attorney said he had launched a criminal investigation into @entity9 's remarks			1
" i believe that the historical evidence is strongly against -- is hugely against -- 6 million @entity19 having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of @entity78 , " @entity9 said in the @entity72 interview , which also appeared on various web sites after broadcast			1
" i believe there were no gas chambers			0
" @entity82 district attorney @entity81 said authorities were investigating whether the remarks can be considered " inciting racial hatred			0
" denying the holocaust is a crime in @entity65 , punishable by up to five years in prison			0
@entity90 @entity19 leaders have also expressed outrage that @entity9 , who was excommunicated in 1988 , was welcomed back to the church days after the interview			1
@entity9 and three other bishops who belong to the @entity53 were excommunicated by @entity95 in 1988			1
the society was founded by archbishop @entity97 , who rebelled against the @entity3 's modernizing reforms in the 1960s , and who consecrated the men in unsanctioned ceremonies			0
@entity3 spokesman father @entity102 said when the controversy erupted that the @entity3 's decision to accept @entity9 was part of its desire to normalize relations with the ultra-conservative group , and had nothing to do with the bishop 's personal views			1
@entity81 decided to launch his investigation in @entity82 because the @entity9 interview was conducted at a seminar of the @entity53 , of which @entity9 is a member , in the nearby town of @entity116			2
@entity81 told @entity2 that a legal representative for @entity9 contacted him and said the bishop denied the allegations			1
@entity9 apologized last week for the " distress " his remarks caused the pope , but did not retract them			0
according to the legal representative 's account , @entity9 had told the @entity72 reporters he did not want the interview aired outside @entity72 -- and therefore , the remarks would not fall under @entity65 criminal law			1
according to the @entity65 criminal code , comments glorifying or denying crimes committed by the @entity11 , or national socialists , are a crime only if they are made publicly			1
@entity81 says he will attempt to question the two @entity72 reporters who conducted the interview			0
he said it was unlikely @entity9 would have to appear in court because he is currently in @entity139 , but the bishop may be required to submit a written statement in the case			2
the pope -- who was born in @entity65 and was a child during the @entity146 period -- rejected @entity5 denial in public statements on january 28			2
after his 14th birthday in 1941 , @entity15 -- then called @entity15 -- was forced along with the rest of his class in @entity152 , southern @entity65 , to join the @entity153			2
however his biographer @entity154 , said @entity15 's family was strongly anti-nazi			0
@entity2 's @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity0 and @entity158 in @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
