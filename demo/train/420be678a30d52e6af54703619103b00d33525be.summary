she declined to be named			0

@entity70 said it was preparing a statement in response			0
opening the @entity7 hearing at @entity0 's @entity32 , the airline 's legal counsel , @entity89 , told the presiding justice that the balloting process contained " serious and substantial irregularities			2
" he called the union 's action in choosing to strike over christmas " willfully disproportionate and clearly unlawful			2
" @entity89 referred several times to the serious disruption that will be felt by the airline 's passengers , saying some " ordinary people will find it very difficult to understand			0
" passengers angry and despairing meanwhile the @entity26 union said it had accepted an offer from @entity7 to meet for talks wednesday afternoon			1
" we are pleased the company has seen sense and will meet with us to seek an opportunity to get the talks back on track , " union spokeswoman @entity107 told @entity2			2

tell us about your @entity7 travel troubles @entity7 says the changes , introduced in the wake of a record pre-tax loss of more than $ 485 million for the six months from april to september , will save the airline $ 665 million			1
meanwhile , @entity18 train drivers based in the @entity16 announced wednesday they will strike friday and saturday , and again december 26 and 27			2
@entity18 , however , said service would not be affected , because drivers from @entity141 and @entity142 would be used			0

she would not divulge specifics of the offer , saying only that it was " enough for a good meal			0
" separately , the @entity163 , an umbrella group for the air travel industry , predicted tuesday that the world 's airlines will lose $ 5.6 billion in 2010			0
that 's more than the group 's previous prediction of a $ 3.8 billion loss in 2010 , but still only half as much as it expects the industry to lose this year			0
" the world 's airlines will lose $ 11 billion in 2009 , " said @entity173 , the association 's director general and ceo , in a statement			0

@entity7 has said passengers holding tickets for the strike period may rebook for any date in the next 12 months with no penalty , but ticketholders still hoping to fly over the holidays are faced with a dilemma			1
what 's the advice for travellers affected by the strike ? the airline has said it will refund a passenger 's ticket only if their flight is canceled , and so far it has not canceled any flights because of the strike			0
passengers not willing to wait to see whether their flight will be canceled can try to rebook on another airline , but @entity7 has said it will not reimburse them for the cost of that ticket if their original flight goes ahead as planned			2
there is little availability on other airlines , and any tickets are likely to be expensive , @entity187 said			0
