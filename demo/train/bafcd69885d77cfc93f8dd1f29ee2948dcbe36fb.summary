-- @entity2 vice president @entity1 and defense secretary @entity3 helped usher in the next chapter for the @entity2 in @entity6 on wednesday , presiding over a ceremony launching a new military operation designed to train , assist and advise the @entity6			1
the ceremony , held at @entity10 in @entity11 , marked the conclusion of the @entity2 combat mission dubbed @entity14 and the transfer to the assistance mission , named @entity14			0
army gen. @entity17 replaced gen. @entity18 as commander of @entity20 in the changeover , held at one of the many palaces of late @entity6 leader @entity24 -- whose regime was ousted from power in the @entity2 - led invasion of @entity6 in 2003			1
@entity1 said @entity14 is over , but promised that " @entity2 engagement with @entity6 will continue " with the new stability mission			1
" this change of mission , to state the obvious , would never have been possible without the resolve and tremendous sacrifice and competence of our military -- the finest , if our @entity6 friends will forgive us , the finest fighting force in the world , and i would argue the finest fighting force that ever has existed , " @entity1 said			1
he acknowledged the pain @entity6 endured during the long war , saying tens of thousands of troops and civilians died , and many more were wounded and displaced			1
however , he said , " i believe that their darkest days are now behind them			0
" noting the divided opinion toward the war in the @entity2 , he said people from both parties had always backed the troops for their " extraordinary service " after " a high - speed invasion that toppled a tyrant became a grinding struggle against violent extremists			1
" " our fighting men and women were given a mission in @entity6 that was as complicated as any in our history , an assignment that taught us that war is the realm of uncertainty , " he said			1
" troops steeped in military doctrine were asked to deal with challenges ranging from electricity to unemployment , currency exchange to trash collection			0
" the vice president also praised the new electoral system in @entity6 , urging political parties there to settle their differences and form a government soon			1
" @entity6 have cast their lot as well as their ballots for a better future , " he said			1
@entity1 highlighted @entity3 ' contributions , saying the defense secretary 's decision to serve under both @entity85 and @entity86 administrations during the war is a testament to his patriotism			1
@entity18 , who said @entity6 security forces are ready to take the lead there , recalled the wartime period as one of @entity6 heroism			1
" this period in @entity6 's history will probably be remembered for sacrifice , resiliency and change			1
however , i remember it as a time in which the @entity6 people stood up against tyranny , terrorism and extremism , and decided to determine their own destiny , as a people and as a democratic state , " he said			1
as @entity1 did , @entity18 urged @entity6 political blocs to form a government , which has yet to be established since elections six months ago			1
" it is time for @entity6 to move forward , " @entity18 said			1
@entity18 said a democratic @entity6 " can become an engine for peace and stability " in the @entity116			1
" we can no longer dwell on our past accomplishments , but must remain focused on the tremendous opportunity at hand			0
@entity6 has always played a vital role in this uncertain part of the globe , " he said			1
@entity17 said @entity6 still faces hostile threats from insurgents working to undermine the country			1
but he said that " the past few years in @entity6 have been marked by steady progress " and he envisions a " stable , secure and unified @entity6			1
" " @entity14 marks the next phase of an enduring relationship " between the @entity2 and @entity6 , he said			1
while the @entity2 combat mission is ending , roughly 50,000 @entity2 troops will remain in the country until the end of 2011 for the assistance mission			0
when asked wednesday if the @entity2 is still at war in @entity6 , @entity3 responded , " no , we 're not			2
" @entity3 added it is up to historians to determine whether the war was worth it			0
along with @entity2 political and military dignitaries , @entity6 officials -- including interior minister @entity142 , defense minister @entity143 and the @entity146 region 's prime minister @entity144 -- attended the ceremony			1
the @entity2 combat mission in @entity6 officially ended at 5 p.m. et tuesday			2
the drawdown and end to the @entity2 combat phase marks a new page in what has been a controversial seven - year conflict			0
weapons of mass destruction , a major justification by the @entity158 administration for going to war , were never found			0
@entity24 was toppled , along with his massive @entity11 statue , but sectarian violence soon erupted			0
on tuesday night , @entity2 president @entity162 addressed @entity2 about the transition in a televised speech			0
" the @entity2 has paid a huge price to put the future of @entity6 in the hands of its people , " @entity162 said from the @entity165			2
" we have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in @entity6 , and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home			2
we have persevered because of a belief we share with the @entity6 people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war , a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization			2
" the war in @entity6 has claimed the lives of more than 4,400 @entity2 troops			2
@entity162 said he was " awed " by the sacrifices of service members and their families and that the @entity2 has met its responsibility			0
" @entity14 is over , and the @entity6 people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country , " @entity162 said			2
" we have removed nearly 100,000 @entity2 troops from @entity6			2
we have closed or transferred hundreds of bases to the @entity6			2
and we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of @entity6			2
" before @entity162 's speech , some @entity85 had urged him to acknowledge that the 2007 @entity2 troop surge in @entity6 ordered by then - president @entity158 had worked			1
@entity162 , as a @entity2 senator and candidate for the presidency , had opposed it			0
@entity162 , who spoke with @entity158 in a phone call earlier in the day , did not mention the former president 's role in the surge			0
meanwhile , senate minority leader @entity207 , @entity208 , delivered a speech tuesday suggesting @entity158 deserves more credit for reaching this milestone			0
" you might recall that the surge was n't very popular when it was announced , " @entity212 said			0
" you might also recall that one of its biggest critics was the current president			0
so it makes it easier to talk about fulfilling a campaign promise to wind down our operations in @entity6 when the previous administration signs the security agreement with @entity6 to end our overall presence there			2
" @entity162 said the most urgent matter now is restoring the economy and " putting millions of @entity2 who have who have lost their jobs back to work			0
" to strengthen the middle class , he said , " we must give all our children the education they deserve , and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy			0
" @entity162 's emphasis on the economy appears to dovetail with the mood of the @entity2 public			0
in a @entity244 poll earlier this month , 56 percent of respondents said the economy would be extremely important to their vote for @entity247 this year			0
fewer than four in 10 said that the wars in @entity6 or @entity249 were extremely important to them			0
@entity0 's @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report .			0
