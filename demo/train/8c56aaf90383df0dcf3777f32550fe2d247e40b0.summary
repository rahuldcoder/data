@entity0 -- @entity3 rep. @entity2 , a self - made @entity4 millionaire , is only in his third term in @entity6 , but he already is in charge of fundraising for the @entity8 , and he sits on the powerful @entity9			1
but all that could be jeopardized			0
federal investigations underway could result in @entity2 serving his next term behind bars			1
@entity1 has confirmed there are no fewer than four congressional and federal investigations into @entity2 's business practices , his campaign finances and his alleged attempt to try to stop a witness from talking			1
@entity6 : same hours , half the work now that witness is stepping forward in an exclusive interview with @entity1			0
@entity2 's former business partner says the congressman schemed to launder money from his car dealerships into his campaign coffers , and then tried to get others to cover it up			1
many of the questions surrounding @entity2 go back to his auto dealerships in @entity4 where he made his millions , and back to the days when he worked with his former business partner @entity35			1
their partnership started at what is now a weed - filled lot , the @entity41 dealership			2
eventually they owned four dealerships together			0
" i respected him , " @entity35 says of their early years together			0
" but @entity35 says he was naive , and that he soon found out the man he believed in was interested in only two things : money and power			0
" mr. @entity2 is a very selfish person , and in my opinion people who go to @entity6 have got to do good for the people they represent , " @entity35 says			1
@entity35 presented to @entity1 the same information , documents and testimony he has given to federal investigators			0
the two men had a falling out over their finances , and they 've been suing each other for years			0
@entity2 says @entity35 is a disgruntled partner and has lied about what happened			1
at the center of @entity35 's allegations is a cash swap scheme used to finance some of @entity2 's campaigns			1
he says employees were forced to write checks , then were reimbursed with cash drawn from @entity2 's car dealerships			1
" it was to a point where i said , ' chief , we ca n't give you this kind of money			0
at which point he said , ' just run it through the corporation , ' " @entity35 said			0
" what he said to me was ' get people to write a check to the campaign and then pay them back through the corporation			0
' " @entity35 did , and he was soon calling in managers , salesman , even assistants			0
people who never gave money to campaigns were suddenly writing big checks to @entity2 for @entity6 and , according to @entity35 , getting reimbursed from the dealership			1
it added up to almost $ 70,000 at @entity35 's dealership alone , he said			0
@entity96 close to deal to extend low interest rates on student loans " i remember one of the partners jokingly saying , ' @entity102 , you have all the money in the world			0
why do you want us to pay you the money ? ' and he said , ' well , it does n't look good if it 's coming from me			0
' " @entity35 took his detailed allegations to the @entity109 , which was already looking into @entity2 's campaign finances			1
investigators there wanted to know not only about how the cash - swap scheme was set up , but if the congressman knew about it			1
@entity35 says there is no question the congressman knew all about it			0
the @entity109 's initial report found " reason to believe " that @entity2 " knowingly and willfully violated " federal election laws			1
read the initial @entity109 report ( pdf )			1
but in a later report the @entity109 pulled back , saying it found credibility problems with both @entity35 and @entity2 and not enough corroborating evidence to back up @entity35 's testimony			1
the @entity109 then dropped the investigation into @entity2 , stating , " while there is some other evidence in the record that is consistent with @entity35 's general allegations , other evidence supports @entity2 's denials or is ambiguous			1
" read the @entity109 report ( pdf )			1
the @entity109 eventually fined kazran $ 5,000 in a settlement because he admitted reimbursing employees for campaign contributions			1
@entity35 has never disputed his involvement , but he says he did it because @entity2 told him to			1
while the congressman has said the later @entity109 report proves he 's innocent , the findings at the @entity109 were more convoluted , stating it came " close to supporting a finding that it is more likely than not " that @entity2 violated the law			1
and that 's where things get much more serious for the congressman			0
during the @entity109 probe , @entity2 pushed to settle a lawsuit @entity35 had brought against him			1
at the last minute , with a $ 2.9 million settlement offer from @entity2 dangling in front of him , @entity35 says he was given an affidavit to sign			2
according to @entity35 , the congressman and his attorneys were asking him to sign a statement that was a lie , that @entity2 knew nothing about the campaign cash swap			1
@entity35 says @entity2 and his team were trying to force him to lie about @entity2 's role in the campaign cash scheme in exchange for the nearly $ 3 million cash settlement , money which @entity35 says he desperately needed , as his finances were in trouble and his wife was suffering from cancer and was undergoing expensive medical treatments			1
" a lot of the language of it was really to distance himself ... , " said @entity35			0
" in short it said that mr. @entity2 had nothing to do with it			2
" @entity35 's lawyer , @entity178 , says it was clearly an effort to lean on @entity35 when he was vulnerable			0
" he was holding the settlement in escrow , " @entity178 says			0
" he basically said , ' we can settle , but there 's one little thing remaining			0
all you have to do is sign this affidavit			0
we release the settlement and everything will be rosy for you			0
' " @entity35 refused to sign and took the affidavit to federal investigators			0
now , @entity1 has learned that @entity2 is being investigated for attempting to tamper with a witness in a federal investigation			2
after @entity1 's repeated requests for interviews were ignored , @entity1 decided to find @entity2 as he emerged from a hearing			2
@entity2 would not respond fully to any questions and quickly walked away from @entity1 's camera			2
when asked if he tried to get @entity35 to sign the affidavit , @entity2 responded " no , no , no , no. no i did n't , " adding that he needed to get to another meeting , and that @entity1 should contact his office			2
when asked if he used the affidavit to hold up the $ 3 million settlement with @entity35 , @entity2 replied : " no. " in a recent report , released quietly several weeks ago , the @entity202 wrote : " there is substantial reason to believe that @entity2 attempted to influence the testimony of a witness in a proceeding before the @entity109 in violation " of federal law and @entity9 ethics code			1
read the @entity202 's report on the affidavit ( pdf )			2
now a full @entity215 is looking into it			0
@entity1 has also learned that the @entity217 is conducting its own investigation			0
in addition , the @entity202 also found " substantial reason to believe " that @entity2 failed to disclose unearned income on his financial disclosure forms from 2007 to 2010			1
read the report ( pdf )			2
@entity224 , a former chief financial officer for @entity2 's business interests for five years , said in a recent deposition conducted by @entity2 's attorney that he submitted a federal whistle - blower complaint to the @entity229 with allegations that @entity2 violated federal tax laws , including tax evasion , fraud and conspiracy to commit tax evasion			1
in the deposition , @entity2 's attorneys asked @entity237 if he stood to gain a " financial windfall " by filing the complaint			2
" the deposition did not provide details of the alleged violations of tax law			0
@entity237 declined an interview with @entity1			0
@entity2 's office responded to @entity1 's interview request with a statement saying the charges are " politically motivated , " that the congressman did nothing wrong , and " we are confident that the @entity250 and @entity215 will reach the same conclusion			1
" on friday , lawyers for @entity2 filed a legal motion in @entity254 , @entity4 , to seal all documents in the @entity35 case and to stop @entity35 and his lawyers from speaking publicly about it			1
@entity2 's lawyers said news stories about the congressman are " publicly disparaging " his character			2
@entity178 said : " as an @entity264 citizen , both congressman @entity2 and i have the fundamental right of free speech			2
... mr. @entity2 's motion is yet another in a series of frivolous efforts to attempt to shut down the case ... and to conceal his wrongdoing behind a shroud of secrecy			2
" @entity1 's @entity275 contributed to this report			2
