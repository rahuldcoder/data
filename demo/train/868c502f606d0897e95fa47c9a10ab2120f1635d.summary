-- there are few cities in the world blessed with a more beautiful setting than @entity5			1
it is surrounded by rugged green wilderness ; to the west the @entity9 , to the east the volcanoes and glaciers of the @entity12 , and all around the brisk waters of the @entity14			0
the @entity15 dominates the @entity5 skyline			1
over the years , @entity5 has inspired a number of nicknames			1
it 's not hard to understand why some refer to it as " @entity22 , " but visit when the sun is shining , when lakes @entity24 and @entity26 are sparkling under a blue sky and majestic @entity28 is visible in the distance , and you 'll realize that " @entity33 " is the most appropriate of its monikers			1
@entity5 started out as a logging town , grew as a stop - off point for gold prospectors at the end of the 19th century , and earned another nickname , " @entity5 " , when plane manufacturer @entity39 rose to prominence in the 1950s and 60s			2
at the height of its powers , @entity39 employed some 100,000 locals and the @entity5 remained a solidly working - class town until the 80s , when local startup @entity46 started making a name for itself			2
as @entity46 grew into the behemoth it is today , other tech firms such as @entity49 and @entity50 were drawn to the city , bringing with them a wave of young , educated and affluent workers			0
@entity5 began to shake off its blue - collar roots and in recent years its cultural credentials have been boosted by the addition of the @entity58 and a showpiece public library , while the acclaimed @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 have all moved into impressive new buildings in the last decade			2
some resent @entity5 's gentrification , bemoaning the near - gridlocked traffic and arguing that the city 's most interesting neighborhoods have lost their individuality to the property developers			1
but if you spend some time in neighborhoods like @entity72 or @entity73 , the self - proclaimed " @entity74 , " you 'll find there 's still plenty of the native free spirit in evidence			0
it was that free spirit that gave birth to @entity82 , the post-punk guitar noise that came out of the city in the early 90s , when local bands @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 became international stars			0
now @entity82 is just a memory , but in popular culture it remains as much of a symbol of the city as the @entity15 , the persistent drizzle and the excellent , ubiquitous , coffee shops			0
despite its rapid growth , @entity5 has kept its trees and parks and many areas maintain an almost suburban feel			0
the city and its residents are laidback and liberal , and that famous free spirit is as at home in the great outdoors as in @entity5 's boho neighborhoods			1
as a modern , civilized outpost among outstanding natural spectacle , the place once known as the " @entity108 " still reigns supreme .			0

@entity5 has been known as " @entity5 , " " @entity112 , " and " @entity33 "
it has a great location , surrounded by mountains , lakes and fantastic *scenery*
the city *boasts* a *symphony* *orchestra* , and *ballet* and opera *companies*
