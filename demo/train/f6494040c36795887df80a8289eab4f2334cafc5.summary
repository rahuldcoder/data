@entity0 -- authorities have arrested a man they claim was plotting to detonate pipe bombs in and around @entity0 , mayor @entity2 said sunday night			1
the intended targets of @entity7 , 27 , were @entity9 military personnel who had served in @entity10 and @entity11 , as well as @entity9 postal facilities and police in @entity0 and @entity14 , @entity15 , according to @entity16 and @entity0 police commissioner @entity17			1
the suspect was described by @entity16 as an " @entity20 sympathizer , " though he is not believed to have ever worked with or received training from anyone in that terrorist organization			1
" there is no evidence he worked with anyone else , " @entity2 said			1
" he appears to be ... a lone wolf			0
" the police commissioner identified the suspect as a follower of @entity31 , a radical @entity9 - born cleric who rose to become a top figure in @entity33			1
@entity34 allegedly tried to contact @entity31 directly , but never got a response			0
an unemployed native of the @entity38 @entity37 who is a @entity9 citizen , @entity7 had lived most of his life in @entity41 , except for five years in @entity42 , @entity0			1
he 'd had been monitored by authorities since 2009 and his extreme positions " made even some of his like - minded friends nervous , " said @entity17			0
the commissioner said that @entity7 even talked about changing his name to @entity50 -- in honor of his now deceased " heroes , " long - time @entity20 leader @entity53 and @entity10 dictator @entity54			1
last august , the suspect allegedly decided to carry out the bomb plot			0
he " jacked up his speed " after september 30 , when @entity31 was killed in a @entity9 drone strike in @entity59 , according to the police commissioner			1
after that strike , @entity33 released a " eulogy " in which it promised to " retaliate soon " for the deaths of @entity31 and three others			0
that threat prompted the @entity9 to issue a worldwide alert warning of such attacks			2
" we knew for the last two years , he 's been reading a lot of jihadist information and talked a lot of inflammatory rhetoric , " @entity17 said of @entity7			2
" but it appears at this juncture the death of @entity31 motivated him and made him increase his tempo			0
" @entity7 bought ingredients for the three bombs that he was working to make at @entity80 and other stores , mindful to shop around so as not to " raise red flags , " according to the commissioner			1
he allegedly planned to test an explosive device in a mailbox before using it against other targets			0

" he was arrested at 3:30 p.m. saturday in an apartment in @entity97 , a neighborhood in northern @entity41 , after he began to drill holes in the would - be pipe bomb , @entity17 said			0
while authorities had monitored him for over two years , they decided to move quickly for fear that device may explode , according to the commissioner			0
" @entity7 's behavior morphed from simply talking about such acts to actions -- namely , bomb making , " said @entity17			2
the suspect allegedly learned how to make a pipe bomb after reading an article entitled " how to make a bomb in the kitchen of your @entity114 " in @entity116 , the @entity20 terrorist network 's @entity118 online propaganda , recruiting and training magazine			1
the issue that came out just before @entity31 's death , for instance , emphasized that @entity20 supporters in the @entity125 should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves			1
" he was a reader of @entity20 's slick online magazine @entity116 -- and inspire him it did , " manhattan district attorney @entity129 said			2
" his stated desire to attack our servicemen and women ... could have come from an @entity20 playbook			2
" @entity129 said that his office and other @entity0 authorities had long been " in communication with federal authorities			0
" that said , @entity7 was arrested by state law enforcement agents and will be tried in @entity0 courts			2
specifically , the district attorney announced that his office filed charges sunday against @entity7 for conspiring to build a bomb for terrorist purposes and possessing a bomb			2
neither @entity2 , @entity17 nor @entity129 gave details on where @entity7 was being held or when he would appear in court			1
