-- this week 's congressional battle over the @entity2 move to repeal president @entity4 's @entity3 , as well as the @entity6 's boos in response to @entity9 's proposed elimination of what he called the " nonessential " @entity3 program , provides yet another reminder of how divided @entity13 has become over this issue			1
other nations have avoided these rifts and built a consensus for universal health care coverage			2
consider the case of @entity20			2
since the early - 20th century , the government and civil society have been proactive in establishing health care as a common good , while sharing the burden of paying for these services through a myriad of taxes			1
still , there are several cracks in @entity20 's generous health care system			1
while the government has certainly been committed to providing a public option , it is simply overstretched			0
federal health care spending is minimal at best , failing to meet ongoing needs , while several managerial , human resource and infrastructural problems remain			2
despite these limitations , it seems that there is one key lesson about health care in @entity20 that we can learn from : that is , an enduring cultural belief and expectation that everyone should contribute to health care and that it is a fundamental human right			1
@entity20 's universal healthcare system is called the @entity50 ( @entity51 , sus )			1
@entity50 is decentralized , such that the management , formulation and implementation of policies are the responsibility of the state and municipal governments			0
in addition to providing free primary care , surgery and medication , @entity50 also provides a @entity63 , where doctors and nurses visit households to provide services			0
@entity20 's health care system is funded through a variety of taxes at the federal , state and municipal level			1
the states receive money from the federal government , while the municipalities receive funding from both the federal and state governments			0
what 's more , the government has always been committed to levying taxes , increasing them and even tapping into the state 's oil revenues to fund @entity50			0
but why has the government been so committed to providing health care ? this endeavor reflects a long history of social and political commitments to providing health care as a government and civic responsibility			1
after obtaining independence from @entity93 in 1822 , @entity20 saw the emergence of well - organized social movements advocating for government intervention in health care			1
supported by personal income and social security taxes , health officials agreed with these movements that health care was a government responsibility and that everyone should contribute to the system			2
this policy idea survived several democratic governments and military dictatorships throughout the 20th century , lasting up through the transition to democracy in 1988			0
it was also sustained with the help of proactive social health movements , such as the sanitaristas , comprised of medical doctors , bureaucrats and politicians			0
this idea of a shared responsibility in providing health care was so popular that it eventually became part of the 1988 constitution			2
through the constitution 's introduction of @entity50 , health care became an official government responsibility and human right , an issue on which liberals and conservatives could agree			2
@entity20 's health care system seems to have paid off			1
@entity20 's average life expectancy has improved at a faster rate than that of the @entity13 since 1960 , though it continues to lag behind			1
life expectancy there increased from 54.49 years in 1960 to 73.1 in 2010 , compared to the @entity13 increase of 69.77 years to 78.24			1
first , notwithstanding heavy demand for health care services , the government has only modestly increased spending for @entity50 from 50.2 billion real ( $ 24.6 billion in @entity13 dollars ) in 2008 to 61.7 billion in 2010			1
second , @entity50 hospitals and the @entity63 have often had a difficult time treating individuals in hard to reach areas , such as the @entity144 region while individuals often have to wait a long period of time for prevention and treatment services			0
consequently , many of the poor in need of immediate care have had to purchase private insurance , or pay out of pocket for services			0
in fact , the percentage of individuals purchasing insurance increased from 8 % in 2000 to 14.4 % of the population in 2005			0
what 's more , there is a chronic shortage of doctors and nurses , especially in rural areas			0
many hospitals are also poorly managed , lacking autonomy from state governing boards			0
and finally , there is a high level of inequality in medical technology and infrastructure , with larger , more affluent municipalities able to provide better technological equipment and medical care			2
while the @entity13 joins @entity20 in lacking sufficient health care personnel , especially in rural areas , @entity13 cities in general are wealthier and have access to the latest technology and health care infrastructure			1
despite @entity20 's ongoing commitment to providing health care , the government will need to ensure adequate funding , hire more personnel and strengthen its facilities before its citizens can effectively benefit from @entity50			1
in short , government " capacity " must meet its unwavering passion for taking care of its people			0
even so , @entity13 can certainly learn a big lesson from its southern partner			0
that is , @entity2 viewing the @entity3 requirement to buy health insurance as an unfair " tax " versus @entity202 perceiving it as a " penalty " should put their haggling aside and instead view the @entity3 as a shared responsibility and human right			0
indeed the @entity20 show us that the right to health care is way too important to be mired in incessant policy debates , regardless of the innumerable challenges that generous health care systems confront , and that it is a common good that all @entity13 should support			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity13 is divided over who should be responsible for paying for health care
@entity215 says @entity20 has long considered health care a right
he says @entity20 's life expectancy has increased at a faster rate than that of the @entity13
@entity215 : @entity20 still lags behind in some areas , *including* *widespread* access to medical technology
