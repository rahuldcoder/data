@entity0 had a secret so macabre , that when a @entity3 sheriff 's deputy showed up to question him about it , he pulled out a handgun and killed himself			1
about three years ago , he deep - froze the body of his mother , @entity8 , law officers said			0
they do n't think he killed her			1
she appears to have died of natural causes at the age of 96 in spring of 2011 , @entity10 said in a statement thursday			1
since @entity0 is dead , there are no charges against him			2
but law officers want to know what he can no longer tell them so they can complete the puzzle of what happened to @entity8 's body from the time of her death until they found her remains this april -- tied up in tarp in the yard of a ramshackle home			1
the picture they have painted so far based on conversations with witnesses and acquaintances has the makings of the stuff of a grotesque novel			0
behind the 8 - ball as @entity8 lay bedridden in their home in @entity40 for the last years of her life , her son sunk into a financial morass			0
he took care of her but was also dependent upon her @entity45 and retirement benefits			0
when she died , he did n't want to lose that income , the sheriff 's office said			1
so he concealed her death and postponed her funeral			0
he purchased a freezer where he kept her remains , the sheriff said			2
talking with him about her was a tough topic			0
" we did n't know she had passed away , and we were afraid to ask , " @entity58 , one of @entity0 's close friends , told @entity61 affiliate @entity60			1
but it seems the two friends did speak about the financial implications of her death			0
" i guess he was afraid to report that his mom died because of what i said about the funds disappearing , " @entity58 said			0
his mother 's retirement checks were not enough to save @entity0 from getting behind the eight ball			1
the family home went into foreclosure			0
" he was forced to move out of his home somewhere around @entity80 of 2013 , " the sheriff 's office said			1
@entity8 found a house to rent in another county , but was in disrepair , not fit to live in without some work			0
law officers believe he took his mother 's body there			2
and as the winter was a bitter , it would remain frozen if left outdoors			0
in the meantime , @entity8 moved next door to his mother 's former home , into the house owned by a friend who did not live in it			1
inquisitive law officers eventually , authorities wondered why there were no signs of life from his mother , and a fraud investigation into the @entity45 benefits began			2
on march 29 this year , a deputy decided to go question @entity0			1
some three weeks after his suicide , police brought in dogs trained to sniff out human remains , but they caught no scent of @entity8 's body			2
during the investigation , detectives came across the property @entity0 had rented and decided to check it out			2
there , a detective found a body tied up in tarp lying partially under a wooden box at the edge of the driveway			0
the sheriff 's office is looking for witnesses to answer many of the questions about what happened to her that her son would not .			1

his mother appears to have died of natural causes in spring of 2011
