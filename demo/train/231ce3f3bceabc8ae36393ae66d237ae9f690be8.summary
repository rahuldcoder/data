@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity6 man fighting for custody of his 9 - year - old son has been invited to spend @entity9 with the boy 's @entity1 family , the family 's attorney said friday			1
@entity12 has been locked in a legal battle over custody of his son , @entity12 , with the family of the boy 's deceased mother			1
the family 's attorney , @entity17 , said friday that the legal battle had gone too far			1
" it is about time that @entity12 's family , and i mean all @entity12 's family , get together			1
i am authorized by mrs. @entity24 to invite you , mr. @entity12 , to spend @entity9 night at her house , " @entity17 said , referring to @entity12 's maternal grandmother			2
" this will be a long awaited family reunion " " i hope you can accept and we can talk logistics , " he said , with the boy 's grandmother standing next to him			1
@entity17 also said that the family would consider allowing the boy to go to the @entity6 , perhaps for the holidays , if @entity12 wants to go			1
however , " @entity12 must be heard in court , " he said			0
there was no immediate response from @entity39			0
earlier friday , @entity39 slammed a decision by a @entity1 @entity42 justice thursday that prevented the boy 's return to the @entity6			1
that decision had " nothing to do with the merits " of the case , he said			0
on wednesday , a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that @entity12 be returned to his father in @entity53			1
that decision was made in accordance with the 1980 @entity56 on the @entity57			0
" every day that my son is under that roof , he is being severely psychologically damaged , " @entity12 said			2
he insisted that there is the " utmost urgency " for @entity12 to be reunited with him			0
" my son is suffering , and he 's losing the innocence of ... a child , " @entity12 said			1
the family argues that it would traumatize @entity12 to remove him from what has been his home since 2004 , when his mother took him to @entity1 on what she said would be a vacation			1
the family said @entity12 screamed with joy when he found out thursday that he would not have to leave with his dad			2
the custody battle began in 2004 , when @entity12 's wife , @entity12 , took their then - 4 - year - old son from their home in @entity53 to @entity0 for what was to have been a two - week vacation			1
she never returned , instead remarrying there and retaining custody of @entity12			1
she died last year in childbirth			2
@entity39 has argued that as the sole surviving parent , he should at last be granted custody			2
instead of traveling to @entity88 , where the high court is , @entity39 planned to stay in @entity0 on friday , where he is just miles from @entity12			2
he has n't seen his son since february			2
rep. @entity93 , @entity94 , who is traveling with @entity39 , said three court - appointed psychologists tasked with determining the boy 's emotional and psychological well - being had unanimously concluded that he is being hurt emotionally " by the continuance of this abduction			1
" @entity93 said @entity12 was previously put in front of a video camera as adults asked questions			0
the boy made remarks in that video that members of his mother 's family suggest indicate he should stay in @entity1			1
if the court allows a child 's drawings or such a videotape to be used as evidence in a courtroom , @entity93 said , " every kidnapper everywhere in the world -- every child abductor in the world " would have the children make such things			0
@entity39 also addressed the videotape : " what is he going to say ? ' no , i hate it here , ' knowing he 'll go back up under their roof ? what do you expect ? he is an innocent , helpless , vulnerable , defenseless child that needs to be freed from this circumstance			0
" @entity93 called on @entity1 's full @entity42 to " vacate this illogical and unjust stay on the rightful return of @entity12 to his only dad			1
" if the court does not do so , @entity93 said , he and @entity39 hope chief justice @entity134 will			0
@entity93 also said @entity1 's @entity135 , which represents interests of the @entity137 in the country , planned to appeal to get the justice 's stay lifted			1
@entity1 's @entity135 did not immediately return calls seeking comment friday			1
@entity12 described how he longed to bring his son home in time for @entity9 , to play with him in the yard , to go to movies and eat popcorn			0
@entity93 said that all the " surveillance " present at the time of the february visit -- including a psychologist that the family had " almost right next to @entity12 and @entity12 the whole time " -- made it " an oppressive situation			0
" " @entity12 ought to be with his son , not on a visit but permanently , " @entity93 said			0
the family has said @entity39 can visit his son			2
" it 's not about going to a compound with a man standing over us , intimidating my son " and " making him nervous , " @entity12 said			1
he added that when his son " was abducted , " he would cry , " i want to be with my dad			0
" in separating the child from him , " you poison the child 's mind , " he said			0
the case has drawn attention worldwide			0
@entity93 called it a " major embarrassment to the @entity1 government			2
" @entity12 said he holds out hope that he will be able to take @entity12 home so the two " can go on with our life as father and son			0
" " i 'm ... begging for justice , begging , " he said			0
" why is it so hard ? why ? " @entity2 's @entity184 contributed to this report .			0
