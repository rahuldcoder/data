young children are far more likely to experience attention and hyperactivity problems if their mother develops diabetes during pregnancy and they are born into a poor or lower - middle - class household , a new study suggests			2
the study , published this week in the @entity9 , found that children whose mothers received a diabetes diagnosis during pregnancy ( known as gestational diabetes ) were twice as likely as their peers to meet the criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity18 ) at age six			1
living in a family with below - average socioeconomic status likewise doubled the risk of adhd in six - year - olds			0
but children with both risk factors -- those who were exposed to gestational diabetes and grew up in a less - than - affluent household -- had a 14-fold increased risk of @entity18 compared to children with neither risk factor			1

" mothers should be aware that gestational diabetes can affect her fetus , " says @entity47 , @entity48 , the lead author of the study and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the @entity53 , in @entity54			1
gestational diabetes , which affects roughly 5 % of expectant mothers in the @entity61 , generally develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy -- the same window of time in which a fetus undergoes a critical burst of brain development			1
@entity31 : tips for a healthy pregnancy with diabetes women with gestational diabetes have abnormally high blood sugar ( glucose )			2
if the fetus is bombarded with excess blood sugar , energy normally used for nervous - system development could potentially be diverted to absorb that excess , @entity47 says			1
as a result , the central nervous system may not develop properly			0
growing up in poverty would likely aggravate any underlying nervous - system deficits , @entity47 says			1
" when babies are born into higher socioeconomic status households , they have better access to medical care [ and ] remedial activities , intellectual stimulus is higher , they have better foods , " she says			0
in addition , low - income women may not control their gestational diabetes as well as more prosperous mothers - to - be , says @entity98 , @entity99 , clinical director of pediatric endocrinology at the @entity101			1
" having diabetes during pregnancy by itself may not be so bad , but if you do n't take care of it , there may be consequences on the brain development of the child , " says @entity98 , who was not involved in the study			0
@entity31 : exercise tips for people with type 2 diabetes @entity47 and her colleagues followed 212 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children living in @entity119 , @entity54 , 10 % of whom were exposed to gestational diabetes			2
from preschool through age six , a trained psychologist or doctoral student evaluated each child for adhd symptoms annually			0
the study had several shortcomings			0
it was relatively small , and although they did take into account the parents ' history of @entity18 , the researchers did n't collect data on whether the children had siblings or other relatives with attention or hyperactivity problems			0
also , @entity98 notes , the researchers did n't measure how well the mothers controlled their gestational diabetes			2
still , the study is a valuable reminder that a child 's environment -- in and out of the womb -- appears to affect the risk of @entity18 , says @entity149 , @entity48 , a professor of psychiatry at @entity151 , in @entity152			0
@entity31 : @entity18 linked to pesticide exposure previous research suggests , for instance , that children are at increased risk of @entity18 if they 're exposed to lead and certain pesticides			0
" as a precaution , we might want to add [ gestational diabetes ] to the list of risk factors we 're aware of , " says @entity149 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study .			2

findings do n't prove that gestational diabetes directly causes @entity18
