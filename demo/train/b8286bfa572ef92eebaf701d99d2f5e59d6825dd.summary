there is no doubt that in our interconnected world , the @entity2 has a critical role to play in driving inclusive growth , creating jobs and increasing global living standards			1
as a long - time advocate for reducing inequality -- or to put it another way , upping the fairness factor in local and global economies alike -- i am heartened to hear world leaders and policy - makers increasingly agree that growing inequality is undesirable			1
but while we all agree that the world is facing an unprecedented number of large - scale , complex economic challenges , there remains heated discussion about the policy fixes needed			0
the diagnoses of the world 's ills are increasingly in alignment -- even @entity31 chief executive @entity30 recently expressed concern about rising inequality -- but the suggested cures are fiercely contested			1
wealth gap increasingly ' obscene ' as economist @entity36 so eloquently argued this year , wealth and the return on capital are growing faster than the overall economy and income from labor			1
making matters worse , labor income is becoming increasingly skewed , with an ever increasing share going to a small band of top earners			0
this means we are approaching levels of inequality in wealth and income that are increasingly difficult to justify , increasingly obscene , and are an increasing drag on productivity and growth			1
inequality of this magnitude undermines the basic notions of trust , fairness , and social cohesion that underpin our economies and societies			0
that 's why civil society wants @entity2 nations to embed equity in their country growth plans by measuring improvements in the incomes of the bottom 20 % of households			1
the @entity2 's commitment to pursuing economic growth of two percentage points above current targets over the next five years is welcome			1
but the success of the @entity79 talks must also be viewed through the lens of fairness			2
leaders must be held to account for ensuring the benefits of growth are spread more widely			2
@entity2 needs to change just as the @entity2 has evolved in recent years from a gathering of finance ministers to include national leaders , the involvement of non-government organizations in @entity2 meetings and decision - making is a reflection of the realities of contemporary governing and policy making			1
put simply : the continuing relevance and legitimacy of the @entity2 as an effective global economic policy - making body is reliant on it being more people - focused			1
that means the realization among global policy agenda - setters that inequality and exclusion stifles economic growth must drive better responses to addressing the economic impact of climate change , for example , and the establishment of robust post- 2015 sustainable development goals			2
the way forward the @entity115 presidency has no less a task than securing the @entity2 's future			2
the jury is still out on whether its outreach to non-government actors and , importantly , to developing nations is enough to deliver this			0
consider the key agenda item of driving jobs growth			0
governments must work with the corporate sector and the community as equal partners to provide real and quality jobs in the formal sector of the economy , with social and legal protections so that all workers , especially those from vulnerable groups , have the opportunity for improved participation			0
the @entity2 is also poised to make genuine progress on glaring faults in global governance , via its tax reform and transparency agenda			1
the potential benefits of coordinated action to increase transparency range from strengthening efforts to combat corruption and money laundering , to finally countering tax evasion and avoidance			0
it 's time to end tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions , and the practices that allow earnings to be " washed " or hidden , as well as the lax residency standards and treaty shopping that allow profit shifting			0
aggressive tax planning alone is estimated to cost developing nations billions of dollars a year			0
these are the same countries which rely heavily on foreign aid and lack the resources to deal with poverty or fund essential health care and education services			0
as governments of wealthy and developing nations alike decry their ability to " afford " to meet the growing demands placed on them by their citizens , they surely have no excuse to ignore the policy levers they have at their disposal to plug leaky and opaque tax systems			0
is it too much to ask that adequate health services , better education opportunities and even clean water no longer remain hostage to capricious and shady global tax arrangements ? i 'd say it 's only fair for the @entity2 to act .			2

@entity2 leaders are meeting in @entity79 to agree ways to boost global growth
@entity192 chief @entity191 says wealth gap is rising and becoming " increasingly obscene "
equity needs to be embedded in country growth plans , he says
incomes of the bottom 20 % of households should be measured
