-- the accusations are ominous			0
@entity3 has fired weapons into @entity5 and boosted the number of troops near the border , officials have told @entity0			1
and the @entity9 is staging a new round of military exercises this week			0
@entity13 leaders stepped up sanctions , but @entity3 president @entity15 shows no sign of backing down			1
what 's his endgame ? " he 's got lots of options here , and he 's playing it , " retired gen. @entity19 told @entity0 this week			0
" he 's like someone fumbling with a lock , trying to find the right key to open the door			0
" here 's a look at several goals @entity15 could have in mind : bolstering support at home @entity15 certainly is n't winning many points worldwide in the court of public opinion			1
@entity13 leaders slam @entity3 for backing separatists in @entity5 and fueling violence there -- accusations the @entity9 denies but ca n't seem to shake			1
but even as criticism grows abroad , things are playing out very differently inside @entity3			1
@entity15 's popularity is soaring , said @entity0 's global affairs correspondent @entity41			1
" his ratings have n't been so high since he went to war with another former @entity13 neighbor : @entity45 in 2008 , " @entity41 said			0
taking over territory this is the scenario that @entity15 's fiercest critics worry is in the offing			1
they point to @entity3 's annexation of @entity52 in march -- touted by @entity3 as a legitimate reflection of the will of the people and slammed by the @entity56 as a violation of @entity5 's sovereignty			1
@entity59 warned this week that @entity3 could use " the pretext of a humanitarian or peacekeeping mission as an excuse to send troops into eastern @entity5			1
" " we 're not going to guess what 's on @entity3 's mind , but we can see what @entity3 is doing on the ground -- and that is of great concern , " @entity59 spokeswoman @entity64 told @entity65 in an emailed statement			2
@entity19 , the former supreme allied commander of @entity59 , said even though it seems like @entity15 has n't made up his mind yet about what steps he 'll take , it 's clear he has his eye on eastern @entity5			1
" he 's building up his capacity to intervene			0
... he wants that to be @entity3 , " @entity19 said			0
protecting @entity3 others argue @entity15 could have another goal in mind if he sends troops into @entity5 : protecting his own country			1
it 's true that @entity15 is weighing intervention , said @entity88 , a professor emeritus of @entity3 studies at @entity90 and @entity91			1
but that does n't mean it 's a crisis of his making , said @entity88			0
" he 's being told by people who are advising him that this is no longer a struggle for @entity5 , but a struggle for @entity3			1
these cities that are being attacked by the @entity5 army are close to @entity3 , " @entity88 said			2
" he 's being told , if you let these cities go , if you lose those cities , you will fight tomorrow in @entity3			2
" @entity103 , a former @entity9 adviser , offered a similar take in an opinion column for @entity0 in march			0
" as @entity5 was slipping into anarchy and chaos , with all sorts of radicals causing mayhem , president @entity15 's endgame became obvious , " he wrote			1
" he needed to do anything in his power to prevent @entity5 from becoming another @entity114 , with a possibility of a civil war breaking out and violence spreading to @entity3 at some point			2
" keeping @entity5 unstable but could there also be an incentive for keeping things chaotic in the nation next door ? plenty , @entity41 said			0
" for years , @entity15 has made keeping @entity5 from joining the @entity125 and @entity59 a major strategic goal , " she said			2
but the february ouster of former @entity5 president @entity127 , who was closely allied with @entity3 , made that much tougher			1
" one way to stop @entity5 from joining the @entity56 , " @entity41 said , " is to make it too unstable by keeping this insurgency running			0
" growing @entity3 's regional influence @entity3 has spent billions of dollars in recent years building up its arsenal of warships , military planes and helicopters to go along with what remains the largest nuclear arsenal in the world , @entity0 's @entity132 said			2
now come the reports of troops amassing near the @entity5 border and renewed military exercises			0
what 's the point of flexing all this military muscle ? you do n't have to look too far back in history to see an example of a similar situation that -- from @entity3 's point of view -- really paid off , @entity132 said			2
in 2008 , @entity3 sent troops into neighboring @entity45			0
" there 's a view in @entity3 that that 's when the world started taking @entity3 seriously again , because for years @entity3 had seen itself as being far behind , hopelessly behind the @entity56 in military terms			2
and that 's a problem that @entity3 's leadership wanted to correct , " said @entity132 , @entity0 's chief national security correspondent			0
@entity132 said the focus is what @entity3 calls " the near abroad " -- former @entity162 republics like @entity5 and @entity45			1
" @entity3 wants to expand , reassert its influence ( there ) once again , " @entity132 said			0
" and it feels it needs , in order to do that , to expand its military			0
" @entity15 issues retaliatory ban on food imports @entity0 's @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
