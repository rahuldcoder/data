-- tears flowed and hugs were traded on thursday in an @entity4 maternity ward as four nurses saw for the first time the baby whose birth they helped safeguard during a direct hit by monday 's tornado			1
" look how handsome your boy is , " said one of them , when she saw the 4 - day - old boy			2
but baby @entity18 's birth came only after a very close brush with the twister			2
his mother , @entity21 , was already in labor when the tornado turned toward @entity24 , @entity4			1
she was so far along -- dilated and going through contractions -- that in spite of the approaching storm , there was no way to evacuate her			2
" she could n't move , " said @entity30 , nurse supervisor at @entity31			1
" she 'd had an epidural anesthesia , which meant that it numbed her enough that she could n't walk			2
" as the tornado came closer , the medical staff moved @entity21 into a hallway , then to a windowless operating room that offered more protection			1
" her baby was not doing the best , " said charge nurse @entity38 , " so i really needed a way to monitor her baby to see how the baby was tolerating the labor process -- especially since she was so far dilated			1
so the only place to do that would be the or			2
" with the twister bearing down on them , the four nurses -- @entity38 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- covered their patient with blankets , pillows and even their own bodies			1
" we actually were on the floor , " said @entity30			0
" bonny the scrub - tech was kind of leaned over her a little more			0
we had blankets and pillows all around her			0
we were holding onto each other -- and the bed			0
" within minutes , the hospital was hit with massive force			1
@entity21 said she did not know whether she and the baby would survive , but she kept praying			1
" i knew we were getting hit directly , " she said			1
" i felt the floor start shaking			0
it feels like an earthquake			0
" the outside wall of the operating room was ripped off , but everyone in the room survived			0
afterward , debris was lying everywhere , including heavy equipment and lighting fixtures strewn across the floor			0
there was wreckage in every direction , there was a gaping hole where the wall once stood , and the baby - warmer was silhouetted against the open sky			0
" i opened my eyes , i could see @entity88 , " said @entity21			1
" and i could see the movie theater			0
" but @entity21 's husband @entity90 -- who had taken cover downstairs with their 4 - year - old son @entity92 -- did not know whether she had survived and did not know how to find her			1
" they were saying ' no , everyone 's out of the building , ' " he said			0
" and i was like ' no , my wife - my wife is upstairs			0
" he soon found her , and she was transported on a flat board down a stairwell and through the debris			0
@entity21 was closer than ever to giving birth			1
she was taken to the nearby hospital in @entity104 and gave birth within hours			1
@entity18 weighed in at 8 pounds , 3 ounces			0
" he probably will sleep through anything now , " @entity30 said with a smile			0
@entity21 is herself studying to become a nurse			1
seeing these nurses put a patient 's welfare ahead of their own , she said , has made her more committed than ever to becoming a caregiver			2
" those nurses are amazing , " she said			2
students , teachers from tornado - leveled school say goodbye a mother 's instincts saves her three sons -- here 's how piece of a children 's book reflects the loss			2

@entity21 was already in labor when the @entity24 tornado roared toward her hospital
it was too late to move her ; her four nurses *sprang* into action to protect her
as her labor *intensified* , " i knew we were getting hit directly "
