dozens of video - capable smartphones -- most of them @entity4 ' own creations -- peered out over the sea of technology journalists like digital periscopes			1
nothing particularly video - worthy was going on in that moment : it was january 2010 , and a bunch of us tech writers , wearing plaid and skinny jeans and funny hats , were waiting in line outside the @entity19 in @entity20 for an @entity22 news conference			1
but a line outside a news conference where @entity4 will appear is no normal line			1
it 's the kind of thing you might just want to record every second of			2
and so , when our media handlers , wearing bright t - shirts with the simple @entity22 logo , let us into the building where @entity4 would unveil his company 's " magical " @entity36 , pretty much everyone in the audience raised his or her @entity38 in unison and clicked " record			1
" i 'm sure our collective scramble down a hall toward a dimly lit auditorium was recorded and uploaded dozens of times			0
@entity22 's revolutionary co-founder , who died wednesday at the age of 56 , had that kind of power over people -- even the ostensibly objective technology press corps , which breathlessly hangs on @entity22 's announcements as if their gadgets have the power to change the world			1
which , if we 're being honest , they do			0
" the world has lost a visionary , " president @entity58 said in a statement posted wednesday night on the @entity61 blog			2
" and there may be no greater tribute to @entity4 's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented			1
" " so much talk on @entity70 of @entity4 , but @entity73 has been eerily quiet the past few hours save the clicking of keyboards he tailored , " @entity70 designer @entity69 posted on his popular @entity70 feed			2
all around the world , it seems , people used the technology @entity4 created to remark on his impact and his passing -- a testament to the personal impact @entity22 's suite of @entity83 has on many of our lives			1
regardless of your technological tack -- whether you 're addicted to that red light that blinks on top of the @entity91 or swear your allegiance to the @entity94 overlords -- it 's hard to deny the industry - changing power of @entity4 and the @entity22 brand			1
before the @entity38 , an app - running , touch - screen device did n't exist			2
it was the first true smartphone , just as the @entity36 was the first true tablet computer			2
but way before that , back in a @entity103 garage in the 1970s , @entity4 and @entity104 essentially kick - started the personal computer revolution			1
in part , i owe the fact that i 'm able to type this story and send it to you over the internet to the vision of @entity4 and @entity104			2
if the technological history explains part of the hype that surrounds every press conference @entity4 presided over , his personal life tells more of the story			1
gallery : @entity4 ' life offstage after we @entity38 - holding hordes made our way into the auditorium where @entity4 would reveal @entity22 's tablet computer , i took a seat next to a buttoned - up tech analyst and noticed the music playing over the loudspeakers : @entity130 's " like a @entity131			1
" " how does it feeeeeeeel ...			0
" @entity133 wrote on its live blog of the event , quoting the lyrics			0
( in case you 're not familiar with that phenomenon , tech bloggers , myself included , post -- instantly and publicly -- pretty much every word @entity4 utters at these press conferences			1
@entity22 does n't allow live video feeds , so these insta - blogs are the only way to get information about new @entity22 gadgets out to the salivating public in real time )			1
when @entity4 emerged , the audience greeted him with a standing ovation			1
again -- all iphones in the air			0
as he paced the stage in front of a massive , glowing @entity160 - style presentation , wearing his trademark mom jeans and black turtleneck , a scruffy beard and @entity165 glasses on his face , writers hung on his every word			2
he told us the @entity36 would be " truly magical and revolutionary , " and the doubters believed him			2
" i went into it prepared to be very skeptical , " @entity172 's @entity171 told me after the event , " but i was impressed			2
" that 's partly because @entity4 carried weight like no one else in the industry			1
his presentations were the rock concerts of the technology world			2
his ability to connect new gadgets with human wants and desires -- their ability not just to make you a productive worker but to connect you with loved ones -- took them to another level			0
his onstage charisma is something everyone since -- most notably @entity195 's @entity194 -- has tried to imitate , without quite the same success			0
that 's partly because of style but also because of history			0
@entity4 ' status as a counterculture figure -- the kind of guy who loves @entity130 , whose company asks fans to " think different , " and who went on a find - yourself pilgrimage in @entity209 , where he experimented with psychedelic drugs -- puts him in a more sacred place in the public consciousness than other tie - wearing tech execs , who seem like photocopies of each other compared to someone with @entity4 ' rich personal history			1
no one videotapes the walk into a @entity222 press conference hosted by @entity223 , for instance			0
i 've been to those , too			0
@entity4 ' story is almost painfully @entity228 and it reads like a screenplay : driven individual from humble beginnings sells @entity233 bus to found company in his family 's garage ; in process , revolutionizes music , digital movies , computing and mobile tech. " to technology freaks and geeks , he is a ' demigod ' , whose product launches are adulatory affairs regularly likened to religious revivalist meetings , " the @entity243 newspaper @entity242 wrote in 2006			1
" the @entity4 life story -- humble birth , rise and fall , then miraculous comeback -- has even been likened by @entity22 fanatics to the heroic myths of @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259			1
" maybe all this , in part , explains why the suit - wearing analyst sitting next to me at the 2010 @entity36 event literally shrieked with joy when @entity4 announced some details of that tablet , including a detachable keyboard he could use to file reports on the go			1
i do n't claim to fully comprehend the pandemonium that surrounds a @entity4 press conference			1
in june 2010 , about six months after the @entity36 event , i attended @entity22 's @entity275 ( known to insiders as @entity275 ) at @entity20 's @entity277			1
that massive glass building was cloaked in an @entity22 logo big enough to have its own zip code			2
inside , the usual suspects were waiting for a chance to see @entity4 unveil the latest - generation @entity38 , which turned out to be the @entity38			1
i was in a pack of tech bloggers waiting behind a velvet rope , just outside the giant conference room where the event would be held			0
we were talking about all the latest @entity38 rumors -- would it really be a game changer , etc. -- when security guards ( really ) lifted the velvet rope to let us in			0
keep in mind there were maybe 100 writers and photographers covering this event and we were getting let in before anyone else -- to choose our seats in a room with at least 2,000 chairs			0
bottom line : we were getting really good seats , no problem			0
still , the moment that rope lifted , there was a mad rush			0
i did n't expect it at all , and almost got knocked out of the way as these laptop - and camera - toting journalists sprinted -- literally sprinted -- into the empty news conference			0
at the time , i thought this was completely insane			0
but , upon reflection , i do n't condone it , but i get it			0
they were rushing not to hear about the @entity38			0
they wanted the best chance possible to get close to a man who 's been described as the @entity320 of our time			0
a man who , in his own words , " put a dent in the universe			0
" you do n't get that kind of opportunity every day .			0
