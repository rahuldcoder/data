-- it 's not just clothes , shoes , sofas and other household goods that are on sale right now -- plenty of footballers are up for grabs as well			0
the january transfer window opened on @entity11 in @entity12 -- 31 days of opportunity for clubs , be they title chasing or relegation haunted , to reinvent their season			1
a window of opportunity for players to seek pastures new			2
a window of opportunity for fans to dream afresh			0
and a window of opportunity for agents and lawyers -- football 's middle men -- to secure their cut from these transfers			1
the biggest deal so far was actually arranged during the previous transfer window , in august			1
@entity34 international @entity33 has now signed a four - and - a - half - year contract to join big - spending @entity37 club @entity36 from @entity38 in a transfer worth an initial $ 52.8 million , with up to $ 6.6m in bonuses			1
file under bargain within hours of this window opening , struggling @entity46 club @entity43 confirmed the signing of @entity49 captain @entity48			0
the 24 - year - old former @entity51 under - 21 defender has signed an initial two - and - a - half - year contract , with the option of a further year , after @entity43 paid $ 990,000 for him			2
by all accounts @entity43 have snagged a bargain			0
over in @entity56 , @entity58 's @entity57 , who has not played for the @entity61 club since september -- partly due to injury , partly due to a dispute over his contract -- is another player likely to move during the january window			1
the 28 - year - old is one of football 's highest - paid players , but he has struggled to regain the heights of 2010 when he helped the @entity72 reach the @entity74 final after a treble - winning season with @entity58 , who are keen to reduce their wage bill			1
speculation also surrounds the playing futures of a host of other players , including the likes of @entity84 striker @entity83 and midfielder @entity85 of @entity86			0
" i think it 'll be reasonably quiet in continental @entity12 , but i can see a few high profile moves happening in @entity91 , " @entity88 chief executive @entity87 told @entity0			2
" in the @entity46 the stakes are so high as regards to television money that in certain scenarios it does actually make sense to spend relatively heavily in an effort to secure an objective , be it a higher table position or staying up			0
" buyer beware @entity104 manager @entity103 has called the january transfer window " the silly season "			1
that is because clubs are loathe to sell their best players midway through the season and if they do more often than not will slap a premium on the departing star , just as @entity113 did when they sold @entity114 to @entity86 for $ 80m in 2011 , with the @entity116 club subsequently paying @entity117 $ 57m for @entity118			2
those two transfers perhaps best demonstrate the danger of buying in january , with @entity114 only just starting to recapture the form he showed at @entity113 , while @entity118 is now on loan at @entity124			2
it is not just the transfer fee and the players ' wages that clubs also have to take into consideration when they sign a star -- there is also the cost incurred by employing the agents who oil the wheels of every transfer deal			1
between october 1 , 2011 and september 30 , 2012 , @entity46 clubs spent over $ 123 million on fees to agents , who fill a dual role -- sometimes working for clubs , while also representing players			1
it is a competitive business			0
in @entity91 there are 493 licensed agents , @entity56 has 937 , @entity147 has 559 , while @entity34 has 291 , according to the @entity149 website			1
" there are too many agents chasing too few players of commercial potential which leads to a ruthless , cut - throat industry , " wrote lawyer and agent @entity151 recently , estimating that there is a ratio of one agent for every six professional players in @entity91			1
even before the window had opened @entity117 found themselves at the sharp end of that " cut - throat industry " as @entity86 expressed an interest in signing @entity165 striker @entity164			1
representatives of the @entity168 international , who has an $ 11.3m release clause in his @entity117 contract , held talks with @entity86 on sunday , which were described as unproductive			0
yet by wednesday @entity86 had triggered the release clause in @entity164 's contract and @entity117 finally gave the 27 - year - old permission to speak to the @entity175 holders			1
the role of @entity164 's representatives -- according to @entity179 media reports his agents want to share fees of $ 3.25m -- has irked @entity117 manager @entity182			2
" in some respects i feel a little bit sorry for @entity185 , " said @entity182			0
" there are people out there fueling this who are not actually involved or want to be involved and that 's the sort of world that we are in			2
" @entity164 's official agent is @entity194			0
@entity0 was unable to reach him via phone or email , but another source close to the negotiations dismissed the 27 - year - old forward 's reported demand for a signing on fee of £ 2m ( $ 3.25m ) and a weekly wage of £ 100,000 ( $ 163,000 ) as " ludicrous			1
" " when i negotiate a transfer i try to do a deal where everybody comes out a winner -- the selling and buying club , the player and the agent , " added the source , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of such negotiations			0
however , the regulation of agents is proving cause for concern for world governing body @entity149			1
with as few as 25 - 30 % of international transfers concluded using licensed agents , @entity149 wants to ditch the system for regulating them			1
" a possible new approach could be to regulate the conduct of clubs and players , and extend the scope of the regulations to include all kinds of intermediaries , " @entity149 said in november			1
" in other words , the regulations would stop attempting to regulate access to the activity , and instead control the activity itself			0
" players and clubs could choose any parties as intermediaries , but would have to meet certain criteria and respect certain principles			2
this approach would also result in the annulment of the current licensing system			0
" but @entity149 's hopes of reforming the agents ' regulations have met opposition from a number of leading football associations , and for the time being the idea of deregulation has been kicked into the long grass			1
not that the agents are particularly happy with how the current system works , with one describing it as a " joke			0
" " i belong to a generation of agents that had to make a deposit of $ 219,000 to get the license , " said @entity34 agent @entity260			0
" i got mine in 1997 as co-founder of the @entity149			2
there were only seven of us and we were called ' the @entity271			0
' " then the deposit was dropped , replaced by an insurance scheme , which had to be done in every country			0
the @entity149 agent concept disappeared then , and licenses had to be issued by every association			2
" if you want a license , i can show you the way to get one for a maximum of $ 6,600			0
" administrative backlog where huge sums of money are involved , disputes invariably follow , thereby providing an administrative headache for @entity149 , which has to deal with 3,500 complaints a year relating to transfers			1
one @entity37 agent , @entity290 , who is still waiting for a decision over a complaint he filed to @entity149 in september 2010 over a transfer , is so fed up with the backlog that he is trying organize a petition among agents to bring about reform of the system			1
" a lot of agents or players called me to tell me about their problem with too long a delay			2
there is a one - session trial per month , which is incredible for the number of cases , " he said			0
" these delays break careers of players and lead to a lot of collapses of business for agents because many of them do n't pursue litigation			0
" a @entity149 spokesman said that type of delay was " very unusual from the cases i 've had to help provide answers to in the past			0
" the more you delve into the world of transfers the riskier business it appears			0
if buyers should beware of rushing to find a bargain in the january sales , agents and players might also proceed with caution .			1
