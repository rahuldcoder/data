@entity0 -- art exhibitions do n't usually float on water but the @entity5 regatta , which debuted this weekend on @entity0 's @entity6 , is no ordinary expose of contemporary culture			1
part fine - art show , part boat - race , the three - day event saw 10 sailboats -- skippered by a host of @entity14 and @entity15 sailors -- take to the water bearing sails adorned with the work of some of @entity21 's foremost modern artists			1
monochrome prints of giant facial features , manic flocks of imposing seagulls and a menacing child with tribal war - paints comprised just a few of the surreal and arresting works on show during a snow - blanketed weekend in the @entity21 capital			1
organizers say the concept marks a first of its kind collaboration between art and top - class sailing and could soon be casting off at famous waterside locations around the world			1

" there is already interest in staging an event on the [ @entity54 ] @entity6 in view of the @entity56 , " he said , adding the possibility of others in @entity48 , @entity49 and on the @entity50			0
artists who contributed works to the riverside event -- which formed part of the week - long @entity63 -- include the fashion duo @entity65 and @entity66 , portrait artist @entity67 , as well as musician and actor , @entity70			2
as @entity5 moves on to other locations , @entity41 hopes creatives of all disciplines and nationalities will be inspired to add their handiwork to the project			0
" it 's a totally new way for artists to display their work , " he explained			2
" this event has given those involved the opportunity to try new things , display their art in a very public place and access to an audience they otherwise might not reach			0
" @entity41 also makes a point of highlighting the artistic difficulties encountered in this new mode of exhibition			0

the manner in which sails are designed to capture wind meanwhile ensures that any design , painting or print is constantly moving and changing shape when on the water , altering the appearance of the artwork in the process			1
according to @entity21 sculptor , @entity113 , who donated a print for the regatta entitled " @entity116 , " tackling these unorthodox requirements was an enjoyable part of the creative process			0
" the sails are a very rich concept for artists to work with and it has culminated in something of pretty majestic proportions , " @entity113 said			1
" it 's a versatile and adaptable format [ which ] when you think about it is basically a new kind of art form			1
" most artists work in a rectangular format but this creates a totally new shape , " he added			0

while unsure about the extent to which artistic sails can integrate into sailing at the very highest level -- where sails have to be as light as possible -- @entity147 believes they can be a valuable asset in garnering the attention of a non-traditional sailing audience			2
" this is something that has never been done before and hopefully it will add a little bit of culture to our sport , " said @entity147 before taking to the water			0
" i 've been so lucky to be involved in sailing since a young age and know how wonderful it can be , so if an event like this can grab people 's attention and get them involved then it will definitely have been worthwhile , " she added .			2
