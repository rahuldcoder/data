@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the shadows of @entity4 , often referred to as the " happiest place on @entity6 , " many children are living a reality that 's far from carefree			1
they are living in cheap motels more commonly associated with drug dealers , prostitutes and illicit affairs			2
it 's the only option for many families that are struggling financially and ca n't scrape together a deposit for an apartment			1
by living week to week in these cramped quarters , they stay one step ahead of homelessness			0
" some people are stuck , they have no money			0
they need to live in that room , " said @entity24 , a local chef and restaurateur			1
" they 've lost everything they have			0
they have no other chance			0
" while " motel kids " are found across the @entity34 , the situation is very common in @entity36 , @entity1 , a wealthy community with high rents and a large number of old motels			1
in 2009 , local authorities estimated that more than 1,000 families lived in these conditions			2
when @entity24 learned that these children often go hungry , he began serving up assistance , one plate at a time			1
to date , he 's served more than 270,000 pasta dinners -- for free -- to those in need			1
" kids should not be suffering , " @entity24 said			1
" [ i had ] to do something			0
" @entity24 , 55 , has always given back to the community where he achieved his @entity34 dream			2
when the @entity58 immigrant arrived in the @entity34 30 years ago , his poor @entity56 skills forced him to settle for a job as a dishwasher			2
but within five years , he had become chef and owner of the @entity0 @entity63 , an @entity58 restaurant that is now a local hot spot			1
in 2003 , he created @entity65 , which raises money for underprivileged children			2
the charity is named after @entity24 's mother , who taught him how to cook at the family 's trattoria in @entity72 , @entity58			1
when she came to @entity1 in 2005 to visit her son , he took her to the local @entity75 , the main recipient of the charity 's funds			1
there , they saw a small boy eating a bag of potato chips and learned that this snack was his supper			0
@entity24 said his mother was shocked by the boy 's meager meal			1
she had raised seven children and always made sure food was on the dinner table , even during the lean years after @entity92 " my mama ... her whole life was to feed kids , " he said			1
the @entity96 found out that the boy lived in a motel with his family			0
the situation was so common in the area that the @entity102 had a " motel kids " program , where vans pick up the children after school and drop them off at the motels every night			1
while these children receive free breakfast and lunch through school programs , their parents often do n't have the resources to give them dinner			1
@entity117 found it unacceptable that the children would go to bed without supper			2
speaking in rapid @entity58 , she made her feelings clear to her son			2
" @entity123 said , ' @entity24 , you must feed them the pasta ! ' " @entity24 recalled			1
when he discovered that this meant feeding around 70 children , he demurred			2
he went back to his restaurant and prepared 70 pasta dinners to serve at the club			0
his mother helped him that first night , and @entity132 has maintained the ritual nearly every night for more than six years -- even through the recession			0
the economic downturn was a challenge , though			0
@entity24 lost 30 % to 40 % of his customers , and the number of children he fed each night more than doubled			1
he often found himself giving away more meals than he served in his restaurant , and he was forced to refinance his home to keep going			0
but @entity24 found that his work with the children helped sustain him , at least on a personal level			1
" so many nights ... it was not too many customers , " he said			0
" [ to ] know that i served 150 kids ... it made me feel better			0
" today , @entity132 's business has rebounded , and his program feeds nearly 200 children , in two locations , seven days a week			2
he also pays for drivers to transport the kids to the @entity75 , and he has purchased another van			0
all told , he estimates that the endeavor costs him around $ 2,000 a month			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity160 @entity161 , the executive director of the @entity102 , says many of the " motel kids " he serves depend on @entity24 's meals			1
he also relishes the irony of the situation			0
" these are some of the poorest kids in @entity0 eating from one of the most exclusive restaurants every night , " he said			0
" i love that ! " @entity171 , 12 , has lived in a motel room with his family -- a total of six people -- for almost his entire life			0
he and his younger brother @entity177 often eat @entity24 's pasta , and his father , @entity179 , says it 's a relief to know that his children can get a free meal			1
" i no longer worry as much , about them [ coming home ] and there being no food , " he said			0
" i know that they eat over there at [ the ] @entity75			0
" this spring , @entity24 plans to expand his program to an additional 100 kids a night , and he will partner with another organization to give 100 children three meals a day			1
he is also calling on other restaurants around the country to work together to feed " motel kids			2
" he believes that providing just a few dinners a night could make a significant difference			0
" every restaurant in the country -- @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 -- let 's do it all together , " @entity24 said			1
" we would have no hungry children			1
" @entity24 's love for the children is clear , but he 's quick to give all of the credit to his beloved " mama " back in @entity58			1
although she suffers from parkinson 's disease , he still talks to her via @entity216 every morning and believes that if she knew how their work has grown , she would be proud			0
although his mother made him start the work , he now says he could never stop helping the children			2
" they 're customers , " he says with a smile			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity65 website at www.thecaterinasclub.org and see how to help .			0

chef @entity24 serves up free pasta to hungry children in @entity36 , @entity1
