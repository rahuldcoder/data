has @entity2 president @entity1 gone completely mad ? this question is actually being debated in serious circles			1
in a telephone conversation with president @entity8 a few months ago , @entity6 chancellor @entity5 is reported to have suggested her @entity2 counterpart is " living in another world			2
" the @entity12 crisis : everything you need to know just last week , a leaked report commissioned by the @entity16 in 2008 concluded that the @entity2 leader may have @entity18 , a type of high - functioning autism			1
the report said it may account for his apparently high degree of control			0
a @entity16 spokesman said there was no guidance from the @entity16 on the report and experts told @entity0 they were skeptical of the reliability of the @entity18 's claim			0
for the record , the @entity29 has dismissed the allegation as utter nonsense			0
@entity1 , though , is an enigma			2
his unflinching support for rebel separatists in @entity12 , despite their alleged excesses , has plunged @entity2 's relations with the @entity38 into their worst crisis since the end of the @entity41			1
even in the face of mounting international sanctions that have isolated @entity2 and helped hobble its fragile economy , @entity43 officials say weapons and manpower continue to flow across the border , although the @entity29 insists it is supplying neither			2
clearly , @entity1 is determined to get his way in @entity12			1
we already know , essentially , what this means in terms of a peace deal -- a truce was signed last september , although it did n't hold			0
the @entity59 agreed that , among other things , autonomy would be granted to @entity12 's southeastern regions			2
the @entity2 language would be given official status			2
a buffer zone would be established along the front lines and heavy weapons would be pulled back from civilian areas			0
but @entity1 may actually want much more			0
on an official visit to @entity71 this week , the @entity2 president dropped a large hint -- and not for the first time			0
in an interview with the @entity76 newspaper he rejected @entity2 responsibility for the crisis in @entity12			1
" it emerged in response to the attempts of the @entity81 and its @entity43 allies , who considered themselves winners of the @entity41 , to impose their will everywhere , " @entity1 told the newspaper			0
" promises of non-expansion of the @entity88 to the east have turned out to be hollow statements , " he said			0
a solution to the @entity12 crisis , then , may involve ruling the country out of any future @entity88 membership , however unpalatable that may be to some in the @entity38			1
@entity2 diplomats call it guaranteeing @entity12 's " neutral status " -- which sounds much better than " capitulation			1
" the bigger problem , though , is that this may not end with @entity12			0
for @entity1 , this crisis is only the latest in a catalog of grievances , which includes the @entity38 trampling over @entity2 's interests from @entity106 to @entity107 , to @entity108 and @entity109			1
@entity1 's ultimate goal may be to tear up the @entity112 assumptions about what @entity2 will tolerate , and permanently change @entity2 's relationship with the @entity38			1
@entity8 says @entity1 has failed to modernize @entity2			1

a solution to the @entity12 crisis may involve ruling the country out of any future @entity88 membership , *writes* @entity120
