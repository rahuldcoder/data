@entity0 , @entity1 -- about six weeks ago , a large earthquake devastated @entity4 and killed over 200,000 people			1
saturday , a huge earthquake releasing 500 times more energy , devastated @entity8 and killed hundreds			1
so why did the smaller earthquake kill so many more people ? and why the sudden spate of disastrous earthquakes in the @entity14 ? no , the apocalypse is not coming			1
no , the two earthquakes are not linked in any way			0
and no , @entity19 , you ca n't blame the @entity20 or the @entity21			0
the real answers , for those comfortable with science and the @entity25 , are tectonics and poverty			1
of the many revolutions of the 1960s , the one that really mattered to geologists was the revolution of plate tectonics			0
tectonics is the word geologists use to describe the process by which mountains move and rocks squeeze and crunch			0
in the sixties , new data from research cruises and from earthquake seismometers led to the realization that tectonics makes mountains slide sideways long distances			1
@entity51 scientists discovered that the @entity51 has a patchy skin of mobile plates a hundred miles thick and thousands of miles across , and that they move horizontally at a slow but irresistible pace			2
it 's where they collide that our problems begin			2
@entity60 is a prime example of this process , one that geologists call " subduction			0
" it 's why we have the long chain of mountains called the @entity69 and it 's why countries like @entity8 and @entity71 suffer giant , destructive earthquakes every few decades			1
off the coast of @entity8 is a tectonic plate called the @entity76			1
unseen by most , it has been inching its way towards the @entity60 continent , and sliding underneath it , for well over a hundred million years			0
since the day that @entity82 first rounded @entity83 it has encroached by 130 feet in a roughly east - north - east direction			0
the @entity76 plate does n't slide under the @entity60 plate in an orderly fashion though			0
it moves in fits and starts , sometimes sticking and sometimes slipping , sometimes here and sometimes there			0
along the coast of @entity8 , patches can get stuck for over a hundred years			1
when they do finally slip , they go with a bang			0
all that squeezing energy is released in seconds and an earthquake happens			1
on saturday a patch roughly the size of @entity101 came unstuck , unleashing one of the most powerful tremors ever recorded			0
fifty years ago , a patch four times bigger and with an area of about 50,000 square miles , the size of @entity105 , slipped and triggered the @entity110 earthquake			1
its magnitude has been estimated as at least 9.5 , making it the largest earthquake of modern times			1
over millions of years , this tectonic squeezing has formed the @entity69 and raised the high desert known as the @entity118			0
elsewhere it has created the @entity120 , the @entity121 , the @entity122 , and @entity123			0
it has also created and distorted some of the islands of the @entity127 , including @entity4			1
so that 's why some parts of the world suffer from big earthquakes that strike with irregular frequency , while other regions are seismically quiet : it all depends on where the plates meet and how fast they are running into each other			1
knowing this helps us assess seismic risk and mitigate it			0
it helps us know where the strongest earthquake shaking will hit and roughly how often			2
predicting when the shaking will hit is a much greater challenge , and geophysicists are working hard to reach that goal			0
in any case , prediction is not the real problem : poverty is			2
poverty is what ultimately kills most people during an earthquake			1
poverty means that little or no evaluation is made of seismic risk in constructing buildings and no zoning takes place			2
it means that building codes are not written , and even if they do exist they are difficult , or impossible , to enforce			2
it means the choice between building robustly or building cheaply is not a choice at all			2
@entity4 is a tragic illustration of this			1
weak building materials and poor construction standards share much of the blame for the grotesque numbers of fatalities , injured and internally displaced people			2
of course it 's complicated			2
earthquake shaking is a complex process and the chain of causation from earthquake source magnitude through infrastructural damage to human harm involves factors like the type of earthquake fault , its orientation , the hardness of bedrock or presence of wet soil , and so on			1
a lot also depends on the time of day the earthquake strikes in terms of how many people are inside buildings that could collapse			0
population density , distance from the epicenter , and the depth of the rupture are the most important factors of all			0
nevertheless , those countries most at risk of seismic tragedy are not simply those on tectonic plate boundaries , but also those with the least money to spend on protecting themselves			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

@entity8 's quake released 500 times more energy than @entity4 's , says @entity213
earthquake 's magnitude is related to movement of plates on earth 's *surface* , @entity213 says
quake damage partly *due* to level of poverty , quality of building *techniques* , he says
