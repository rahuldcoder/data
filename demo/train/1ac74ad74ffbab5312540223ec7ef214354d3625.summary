-- the premise of social discovery seems simple : uncover the people and events around you , in real time , based on user interests and / or locations			1
but many worry today 's social apps define privacy in very different and sometimes concerning terms			1
in 2012 , @entity12 revamped its privacy policy to much protest , and @entity15 settled a case with the @entity17 over its personal information collection practices			2
as more of these social discovery applications emerge , two concepts remain key : user discretion and transparency			2

according to " teens , @entity39 and @entity40 , " a report issued last month by @entity42 , teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they have in the past , but they 're also taking a variety steps to manage the privacy of that information			1
the report indicates that 91 % have posted a photo of themselves ( compared to 79 % in 2006 ) ; 20 % share their cellphone numbers ( compared to 2 % in 2006 ) , and 16 % automatically include location in their posts ( very rarely an option at all in 2006 )			1
only 9 % say they are very concerned about third parties accessing their data			0
for one , social media user @entity53 of @entity55 , @entity52 is wary of all things location - based			1
" it 's one thing to throw a quick status on @entity59 or update at the end of the day , but constant updates on where you are or where someone else is does n't really add value to my life , " he says			2
" the only good use case is if i 'm out and about and have nothing better to do			0
[ @entity69 ] find out someone i know is close , so we can hang out			0
" we gleaned some insight from developers behind three very different location - based discovery apps — @entity76 , highlight and @entity77 --- along with their users , to find out whether the value of sharing outweighs the apps ' " @entity82 " factors			1
we asked how they aim to make privacy settings more transparent than in years past			2
@entity76 — a communication tool to call , message and create chat groups with existing friends — recently launched a new broadcasts channel , where users connect with like - minded people and groups			2
the app targets specific users based on their locations , interests and in - app interactions			2
@entity76 ceo @entity98 says user transparency was key in developing a trustworthy and safe resource , where users would be comfortable sharing with one another			2
" often with new technology , there is a bit of hesitation from users who do n't understand how to use it , and what is and is n't okay , " he tells @entity104			2
" since we started developing the @entity114 network , we 've focused on creating policies that are transparent to our users , as well as building out a user support and safety team			0
" on @entity114 , users can block messages from certain people and hide their availability from people not in their contacts			2
they also have the option to turn broadcasts off and on			0
in response to users still wary about exposing too much information or sharing with people they do n't know , @entity98 says they can access people they may not be able to otherwise			1
" broadcasts are quite a mixed bag			0
because they 're public and anyone can post them , it 's not uncommon to see some very strange people talking about very strange things , " " broadcasts are quite a mixed bag			2
because they 're public and anyone can post them , it 's not uncommon to see some very strange people talking about very strange things , " says @entity114 user @entity142 of @entity143 , @entity151 " however , the vast majority of posts i 've seen have been really cool			1
usually , i 'll see people sharing interesting recipes or cool new music , or debating political issues			1
" to reduce unwanted conversations , @entity114 broadcasts utilize " communication points , " which help users avoid unwanted attention			0
if a user does n't have you in his or her contact list , it will cost you points to message them			0
earn points by inputting data about yourself , linking social media accounts and inviting others to join the network			1
" i 'm more than happy to share plenty of details about myself , " @entity142 says			0
" but when comes to personally identifying information , i 'm a lot more wary			2
" @entity179 discovery app highlight alerts you when other users or friends are nearby			1
by giving you the ability to see exactly where they are via map , you also have access to their names , photos , mutual friends , social networks and interests in common			0
" the premise sounds really cool : sifting through the people around you to help leverage social networks			1
but i find it creepy , " says highlight user @entity197 of @entity198 , @entity199 " i think it would be cool in a city like @entity203 or @entity204			0
in @entity198 , there were n't very many users , so you would see the same people every day pop up			0
" while highlight founder and ceo @entity211 sees the app as a " bird 's eye view of the world , " he says it is going to take awhile to figure out social norms as more products use new technology for sharing			1
" any time a new piece of technology comes out , it has never been an option before , so it might be uncomfortable at first , " @entity211 says			0
" but over time , the social benefits outweigh the cost of privacy ... look what happened with @entity59 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			1
" in turn , he says , users can manage their privacy settings by limiting their profiles to who can find you , and where , even electing " hiding spots " that let them go " off the grid			0
" " the service is entirely opt - in ; everyone has chosen to do it , " @entity211 says			0
combining location and social updates , @entity77 delivers publicly available posts from social networks — @entity59 , @entity229 , @entity12 , @entity230 , @entity228 and @entity250 — from any location in the world , whether from your friends and common connections , or the general public			1
users can find posts from specific locations by entering a keyword , something @entity77 founder and ceo @entity263 calls a " there " instead of " here " experience			0
a recent app update added channels ( sports , music , news , etc. ) , which allow people to observe live events around the world			1
or if you missed it , go back in time and see everything that was posted for the event			0
an additional @entity77 feature alerts users when friends from their social networks are nearby , an in - app commodity that , according to @entity263 , everyone should be doing			1
he would n't categorize @entity77 in the " social discovery " realm , though , because it 's more location - focused , something he says you ca n't really talk about without mentioning privacy			1
" you have to give the user full control of how they adjust their privacy , " he says			1
" we check the privacy settings you have on every social network connected , so that posts are shared with the intended audience only ... banjo never shows your location unless you want it to			1
" he explains that a user 's location is determined by his vicinity or region , not his exact position , and that users have control and power over how much they want to share			0
" as long as my location is never more accurate than the name of the city i 'm in , i do n't find it creepy at all , " says @entity142			0
" i do n't particularly care that a lot of the people i talk to are relative strangers			0
as long as they 've got something interesting to say , i 'm happy to listen			0
