-- of all the things @entity1 had to worry about while pursuing his dream of skydiving from 120,000 feet , the one that almost stopped him cold was ... claustrophobia			1
" @entity1 " got a bit freaked out by the pressurized suit he 'll wear during his ascent and , more importantly , his supersonic descent from 23 miles up -- now tentatively scheduled for sunday or monday			1
getting over his discomfort was a key hurdle to clear as the @entity16 adventurer set out to make the highest skydive ever			0
opinion : the space adventure you ca n't miss to that end , @entity21 , his sponsor , called in dr. @entity24			0
he 's a sports psychologist who specializes in high - performance and " extreme " sports like , say , falling out of the sky at the speed of sound			2
@entity21 wanted him to psychologically evaluate @entity1 and help him conquer his fear			1
it must be said that @entity1 is no stranger to fear or death - defying situations			1
the 43 - year - old former military parachutist has made more than 2,500 jumps , including dives from the @entity34 and the @entity36 skyscraper			1
clearly he has learned how to put aside fear , even use it to his advantage			0
" @entity40 has become a friend of mine , " he said in a statement			1
" it 's what prevents me from stepping too far over the line			0
on a mission like this , you need to be mentally fit and have total control over what you do , and i 'm preparing very thoroughly			0
" but his plan to break the unofficial record retired col. @entity54 set with a leap from 102,800 feet in 1960 revealed a fear @entity1 had n't felt before			1
and it had nothing to do with coming down from such a height , but suiting up to reach it			0
to prevent a potentially fatal condition called ebullism , @entity1 must wear a custom - made space suit and helmet			1
although the suit , based on those worn by high - altitude reconnaissance pilots , is designed to maximize maneuverability and visibility , it constricts his movement and vision			1
he 'd never worn a pressurized space suit before , and he felt the claustrophobia — which , according to a @entity75 account , was so severe it brought on panic attacks — threatened to bring the mission to a screeching halt			1
skydiver to try again for record free fall that 's when @entity24 stepped in			0
after determining that @entity1 was entirely committed to making the jump and not using claustrophobia as an excuse to back out , he set to work			1
( @entity1 , who is in @entity86 , @entity87 preparing for sunday 's launch , could not be reached for comment , but @entity21 confirmed @entity24 ' account for @entity0			1
) over the course of three days , @entity24 determined @entity1 did n't have quite the right tools to manage his mind and emotions in the face of so great a risk			1
that 's where the suit became an issue : it was a symbol of his not having complete control of the situation			0
to combat this , @entity24 said , @entity1 had to reconnect with his vision			1
he 'd become too focused on the suit , not the goal he hoped to reach wearing it			0
simply put , he needed to get his eyes back on the prize			0
" when we are in a high stakes or intense situation , it 's not uncommon for our minds to jump forward , going to the next moment and worrying about what happens when this moment does n't go well , " @entity24 said			0
" what happens is we give 50 percent to something that does n't exist yet and 50 to this moment			0
" to reconnect with his vision , @entity1 needed to reconnect to what @entity24 called his hidden journey — what the jump meant to him , beyond being the first person to skydive from so great a height , or being the first person to exceed the speed of sound ( about 700 mph at that altitude ) in free fall			1
the hidden journey , he said , is much more basic : @entity1 wants to go somewhere no one has ever been			2
@entity24 taught @entity1 how to better manage his mind and body under pressure			2
@entity1 mastered something @entity24 called " combat breathing , " or deep breathing , to calm himself			2
and he developed positive self - talk , using great care in choosing the words he used when talking to himself and others about the jump			2
" self - talk is considered one of the most powerful mental skills , " @entity24 said			0
" @entity148 talk is the foundation for self - confidence and self - esteem			0
" to sharpen these skills , @entity24 put @entity1 in increasingly uncomfortable situations — which he would not specify — and made him try to gain control of his body and mind			1
" we cultivated a situation to move a person to the edge of panic , " said @entity24			0
" imagine doing that repeatedly over 30 hours of training and at the end of it , you 've got full control of how your mind works , and you breathe freely in those moments			0
" to further help @entity1 , @entity54 — a trusted adviser who has worked closely will @entity1 over the years — will be the only voice the @entity16 will hear on the radio			2
" @entity1 trusts me because i know what he 's going through — and i 'm the only one who knows what he 's going through , " the retired colonel told the @entity75			2
his flight team also devised a detailed pre-launch procedure to help occupy @entity1 's mind before lift - off			1
once @entity1 's mind was at ease , @entity24 had to convince the @entity182 team the problem had been solved			2
because his ascent , in a space capsule dangling beneath a 55 - story helium balloon , would take about 3.5 hours , and the descent about 20 minutes , he had to demonstrate 4.5 to five hours of proficiency in the suit			2
" then they would feel comfortable that @entity1 as a man and an athlete could manage himself in a space where no one else has been , " @entity24 said			2
we already know @entity1 passed the test , because he made successful test jumps from 13 miles up in march and 18 miles up in july			1
that said , the repeated weather delays — the jump has been twice delayed by high wind — ca n't be helping the mental strain , but @entity24 is confident that @entity1 has what it takes to stay focused on the task at hand			1
" he 's somebody that is willing to commit everything to his vision , " added @entity24			0
" everything is on the line			0
it 's a great emblem for all of us to find value and fully commit to a vision			0
