it could be a family affair for the @entity3 sisters at the @entity4			1
if @entity7 and @entity3 -- who have combined to tally 25 majors -- both win their quarterfinals wednesday , they 'll meet at a grand slam for the first time since the @entity13 final in 2009			1
but monday was already a day of ' firsts ' for @entity3 , whose career has been hindered by the autoimmune disorder @entity17			1
when the 34 - year - old beat sixth - seed @entity19 6 - 3 2 - 6 6 - 1 , she ensured a quarterfinal berth at a grand slam for the first time in five years			2
further it was her first top - 10 win at a major since downing @entity28 's @entity27 at the @entity29			1
" of course , i want to be playing deep in all my events , " @entity3 told reporters			1
but it really just does n't happen every time for everyone			2
" now is my moment and i want to keep this moment going all year and then next year , too			0
" but reaching the quarterfinals in @entity41 wo n't be enough for her			2
she still has the game and belief , she said , to go even deeper			0
" i feel like i 've been here before , so it 's not like i 'm jumping up and down for joy , ' oh , shoot , what is this ? i 've never done this , ' " she continued			0
" yes , i 've done this			0
this is what i 'm always going into each tournament thinking i want to do , even when i fall short			0
" it 's definitely not the first time			2
i guess that 's how i feel			0
" @entity7 cheered on her sibling from the players ' box during the victory over @entity19 and said following her own win over @entity63 that she was still inspired by @entity3			1
" she 's a big influence , obviously , " said @entity7			1
" the way she 's playing , her confidence exudes and permeates to me			0
it 's a really good feeling			0
