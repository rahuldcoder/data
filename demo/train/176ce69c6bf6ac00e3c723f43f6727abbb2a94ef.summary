-- for months now , platoons of politicians have been filling the air with words			1
but today , if only for a few minutes , can we forget about the politicians and express our sympathy for one of the words ? it 's such an amiable word : a word that is friendly and easygoing and nonconfrontational , a word that would never want to get dragged into a fight like this			1
yet it is there anyway , caught between practiced brawlers			2
the word ? " @entity16			2
" if you have found yourself paying attention to the presidential campaign that is going to be with us until november , you have heard the word			2
two of the candidates in the @entity24 primaries -- @entity25 and @entity26 -- have used the word regularly to assail one of their opponents , @entity28			1
" @entity33 moderate , " @entity31 has said of @entity28 , over and over , with unmistakable derision			1
@entity26 has called @entity28 a " mushy moderate , " and has said that delegates at an open @entity24 convention " are not going to nominate a moderate @entity33 governor			1
" now , @entity28 and @entity26 and @entity31 are all experienced politicians			1
they know what they 're doing , and they can duke this out among themselves			2
the purpose of today 's column is not to discuss which of them would make a better president , or whether @entity48 is a better president than any one of them would be			2
we 'll find out about that soon enough			0
but just how exactly did " moderate " become a political dirty word ? it does n't sting -- you would n't think anyone would consider it a killshot			1
if one politician calls another a left - winger , or a right - winger , or a communist , or a fascist , or a radical ... now those are words meant to provoke			0
but to use " moderate " as a weapon ? is this really supposed to rile up the @entity67 people ? are voters supposed to say : " i do n't want that guy anywhere near the @entity71			1
he 's a moderate ! " to most people 's way of thinking , " moderation " has always meant balance , carefulness , calm deliberation , evenhandedness , dispassion , impartiality , judiciousness			1
it is traditionally a conscientious objector in the universe of bellicose language			0
@entity16 weather is lovely weather			0
how are we best advised to eat and drink ? in moderation			0
" @entity93 , " in the world of words , is the common - sense good buddy , walking the straight and narrow			0
it has ever been thus , down through history			0
" out of moderation a pure happiness springs , " said the @entity101 poet @entity100			0
" moderation in people who are contented comes from that calm that good fortune lends to their spirit , " said the @entity103 author @entity102			0
" keep a mid course between two extremes , " said the @entity111 poet @entity110			0
@entity114 , the @entity115 philosopher , may or may not have said the actual words that are often attributed to him -- " moderation in all things " -- but he unquestionably believed in the principle			0
so what 's going on here ? in search of an answer , i turned not to @entity110 or @entity114 , but to @entity124 , the conservative columnist and commentator whose love of language is as passionate as his interest in politics			2
@entity124 is resolute in his conservative beliefs , but he has always shown a willingness to at least listen to the other side			0
he and liberal @entity133 write a regular column for @entity135 called " @entity136 , " where they seek to find precisely that : a meeting place where ideas helpful to @entity67 may be worked out			1
so , @entity140 : what exactly does " moderate " mean as it is being used in the present political free - for - all ? " in today 's vernacular , " @entity124 said , " ' moderate ' has come to mean that you have no fixed principles , that everything can be negotiated away because all that matters is ' the deal			1
' " he continued : " ' @entity16 ' has also come to mean liberal on taxation , regulation and the social issues			0
" we were conducting our conversation by e-mail , so i could n't see his face as he typed the next sentence			0
but , knowing his long understanding of politics and the people who practice it , i have a feeling he was smiling			0
of " moderate , " he wrote : " it is a label that means whatever the person applying it wants it to mean			2
" in the current context , he 's probably right			2
but will it work ? come the general election , will @entity67 band together and slam the door in the face of that dreaded quality , moderation ? it would seem doubtful			1
this is a pretty centrist country			1
the one other time that moderation was referred to with such disapproval on the national political stage was in 1964 , when @entity181 , the @entity24 standard - bearer for president , famously said , in accepting the nomination : " i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice			1
and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue			0
" what @entity181 was trying to get across was that one must fight for one 's principles			2
he was echoing the words and stances of ancient @entity199 's @entity198 and also of early @entity67 's @entity200 , who said : " moderation in temper is always a virtue ; but moderation in principle is always a vice			1
" it was a distinction largely lost on the electorate			0
@entity181 was never able to recover from the controversy over that speech , and @entity212 -- whose strategists used @entity181 's words to hammer the thought into voters ' minds that someone who spoke well of extremism might be an extremist -- won in a landslide			2
but this is n't about landslides or squeakers			0
it 's about that mild - mannered little word that has suddenly found itself turned into an epithet			1
when the dust of 2012 has cleared , and the election is over , that word -- wounded , staggering , wondering just what in tarnation happened to it -- will do its best to go on with its life			1
it may even allow itself to get angry			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

@entity238 : politicians have been *tossing* around the word " moderate " like it 's an *insult*
he says @entity24 *rivals* deride @entity28 as a " mushy " @entity33 moderate
but word *connotes* balance , care , evenhandedness , @entity238 says
he says @entity67 are pretty centrist and the word will survive 2012 beating
