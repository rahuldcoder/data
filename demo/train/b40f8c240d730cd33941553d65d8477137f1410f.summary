@entity0 -- @entity3 sen. @entity2 of @entity4 on saturday threw his support behind the @entity7 ' health care reform bill , giving the party the crucial backing it needed to avoid a @entity11 filibuster that would prevent a @entity13 vote			1
the first of a series of votes is set for monday at 1 a.m. , on a so - called manager 's amendment , consisting of amendments crafted in the last week - and - a - half by senate majority leader @entity20 of @entity21			1
at the request of @entity11 , the entire package of amendments -- 383 pages -- was being read saturday , for hours , on the @entity13 floor			1
the @entity13 could vote on the entire bill , a top priority of president @entity29 , before @entity30			1
however , a @entity32 @entity7 leadership source told @entity1 that @entity29 's repeated requests for a health care bill to arrive on his desk by the end of the year wo n't be met			1
the source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the ongoing internal discussions within the party , said there is " no chance of a conference between @entity30 and @entity45 's			2
" sen. @entity46 , the @entity47 , said the latest version of the @entity13 health care bill " is a legislative train wreck of historic proportions			1
" " if [ @entity7 ] were proud of this bill , they would n't be doing it this way , " @entity52 said			1
" they would n't be jamming it through in the middle of the night on the last weekend before @entity30			2
" @entity52 said the legislation " will have a profound impact on our nation			0
this is not renaming a post office			0
make no mistake , this bill will reshape our nation and our lives			2
" @entity20 and sen. @entity69 of @entity70 spent most of friday trying to answer concerns from @entity2 , who had held back on supporting the bill because of his objections to public funding for abortions			1
@entity69 said negotiations with @entity2 over the legislation 's health care provisions began friday morning and ended with handshakes close to 11 p.m. @entity69 and others involved in the talks said @entity2 did n't want to make a public announcement about his decision to back the bill until the negotiated abortion language was entered into the record			1
@entity2 's backing gave the @entity7 the crucial 60 votes needed to move the bundle of recent amendments , which involved a spate of compromises , to the @entity13 floor			1
" @entity95 is never easy , but change is what 's necessary in @entity3 today			2
that 's why i intend to vote for cloture and for health care reform , " the @entity4 @entity98 told reporters			2
cloture is the procedure that allows senators to place a time limit on consideration of a bill or other matters , and thereby overcome a filibuster			2
@entity2 warned , however , that if there are changes to the health bill when @entity32 and @entity13 leaders meet to resolve their differences , he will withdraw his support			1
the @entity32 has passed a different version of the bill			0
@entity29 said the @entity13 's health care reform bill would be the largest deficit - reduction measure in a decade			1
" we are on the cusp of making health care reform a reality , " he said			0
" with today 's developments , it now appears that the @entity3 people will have the vote they deserve on genuine reform that offers security to those who have health insurance and affordable options for those who do not			0
" according to the @entity136 , the legislation would offer a decrease in the deficit of $ 132 billion over the first decade , and more than $ 1 trillion in the 10 years after that , @entity29 said at a brief news conference			1
the new cost for the revised @entity13 bill is $ 871 billion , the @entity136 said			1
the previous price tag was $ 848 billion			0
@entity29 's was one of a flurry of press briefings held saturday after @entity2 's announcement			1
@entity2 , a social conservative who opposes abortion , did not want taxpayer funds to pay for the medical procedure			2
one of his main requests was that states that offer insurance present at least one plan without the abortion option			2
in addition , he was assured that anyone receiving federal health subsidies would pay separately for an abortion			0
two liberal @entity3 senators who had not committed to supporting the health bill also announced saturday that they would vote " yes " on its passage			0
sen. @entity165 , a @entity166 who caucuses with the @entity7 , said he changed his stance because the measure now contains provisions for new community health centers			1
sen. @entity172 , @entity173 , said he favored the insurance reforms in the legislation			0
neither is totally pleased , but they told @entity1 it 's a good first step			0
sen. @entity178 , @entity179 , who was involved in some talks with @entity2 , said she 's satisfied that the agreement 's language achieves its goal			1
" my goal was to try to reach some compromise so we could move forward on health care , where the basic premise was we could separate federal funds from private funds			0
i think we achieved that			0
" sen. @entity192 , @entity193 , agreed , saying the deal follows the principles of the @entity197 amendment , which prevents federal funds from being used for abortions			2
" anyone who is in the exchange who also gets a federal subsidy because they 're poor , if they choose a private insurance policy and want any kind of abortion coverage , they have to write that part of the premium from their own personal funds , " the @entity193 senator said			0
the health bill proposes a health insurance exchange for those unable to afford health coverage or do n't have coverage			2
no federal funds could be used to cover abortions for people participating in the exchange , the bill says			0
in addition , under national plans that would be administered by the @entity227 , there has to be , if a state chooses those , at least one that does not offer abortion coverage			0
meanwhile , two congresswomen said they had " serious reservations " about the abortion provision in the @entity13 version of the health care bill			1
" this provision is not only offensive to people who believe in choice , but it is also possibly unconstitutional , " said @entity3 reps			0
@entity243 , @entity244 , and @entity245 , @entity173 - @entity70 , in a statement saturday			0
" as we have maintained throughout this process , health care reform should not be misused to take away access to health care			0
the more than 190 - member @entity252 will review this language carefully as we move forward on health care reform			0
