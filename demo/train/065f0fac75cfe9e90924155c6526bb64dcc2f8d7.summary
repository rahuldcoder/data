@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's diplomatic squabble centered wednesday on a siege laid to a posh waterfront hotel where the president - elect has been holed up under the protection of @entity9 peacekeepers			1
the world body , meanwhile , said it would ask the @entity11 to approve up to 2,000 more troops to help ensure the presidency for @entity14 , recognized as the rightful winner of the disputed election that sparked the current political crisis			0
@entity18 , the under - secretary - general for @entity9 peacekeeping , said after a @entity11 briefing that he was worried " we are facing more difficulties " in @entity1			0
as the political standoff continued , the top @entity25 diplomat on @entity26 said @entity28 , the defiant self - declared president , had " stolen " the vote that removed him from office			1
" there is no question but that the election in the @entity1 was stolen by president @entity28 and those around him , " assistant secretary of state for african affairs @entity31 told reporters wednesday			1
@entity28 's " continued presence in office amounts to a theft of the election , " @entity31 said			1
the @entity25 and other countries have offered @entity28 what they call a " dignified exit , " which could mean living and working in other countries , including the @entity25			1
@entity28 , however , has ignored those offers and has refused to accept telephone calls from @entity25 officials			1
@entity31 said @entity28 has challenged democracy not only in @entity1 but also in the entire region			1
@entity28 , appearing to be softening his stance , had agreed to remove a military blockade around @entity14 's headquarters , but had not done so by wednesday afternoon			1
" the promise has not been kept , " @entity56 said			0
@entity58 , @entity28 's foreign minister , said @entity28 justified the continued siege as " a measure of security " because 300 of @entity14 's soldiers within the hotel are heavily armed			1
this hotel is a short boat ride from @entity28 's residence			1
@entity58 said the armed soldiers also posed a danger to people living near the hotel			2
@entity28 , said @entity58 , is waiting for @entity14 to release the soldiers before pulling back the military			1
" the information i have is that he will lift the blockade , " said @entity72 prime minister @entity71 , the @entity73 envoy for the mediation effort			1
" he called the head of the military in our presence and asked him to lift the embargo , and i 'm assuming that has happened			2
" @entity71 , who visited @entity0 earlier this week with a delegation representing @entity26 states , said @entity28 was open to a meeting with the president - elect			1
" he ( @entity28 ) does not want any conditions , " @entity71 said			2
" he wants amnesty , he wants to know he 's safe if he chooses to stay			0
these are things that have to be discussed face - to - face			0
" in short , @entity71 said , the disputed president is willing to negotiate unconditionally			0
" but @entity14 is not willing to negotiate unless @entity28 accepts that he 's president , " @entity71 said			1
" @entity14 is being difficult			0
" @entity14 has said he will ensure protection for @entity28 if he concedes , @entity71 said			2
major organizations , including the @entity97 and the @entity73 , have declared @entity14 the winner of the november 28 presidential runoff vote			0
@entity28 , the incumbent , considers himself the rightful winner , and has not budged amid international pressure on him to step down			2
violence following @entity28 's refusal to vacate office has left more than 170 people dead in @entity1 and disrupted life for residents in @entity0 , the country 's commercial hub			1
@entity26 states will oust @entity28 using military force if the standoff continues , @entity71 said			1
" we made it very clear that the stand of the @entity73 and @entity97 is that @entity14 is the legitimate president , " he said			0
" and in the absence of a peaceful settlement , military action will be pursued			0
" @entity71 , who was named prime minister after an election dispute led to the formation of a coalition government in @entity72 , said power - sharing will not be an option for the @entity26 nation			1
" it is dangerous , " @entity71 said			0
" it was replicated in @entity72 and @entity128 , and set a dangerous precedence ... because it tells losers that they can cling to power in the hopes that a power - sharing will be worked out			2
" a coalition government is not " a healthy process , " he said			0
" losers must agree to surrender power			0
" the @entity25 will not consider a power - sharing agreement because the outcome of the election was clear , @entity141 spokesman @entity140 said			2
" no one disputes the results of the election besides president @entity28 , " @entity140 told reporters			2
" and we believe that for the future of democracy in @entity1 and @entity26 that he should step down			0
and that is why we continue to support diplomatic efforts to resolve that with the peaceful transfer of power to mr. @entity14			0
" @entity1 is the @entity157 name for @entity1 , a former @entity157 colony			0
@entity28 has demanded a recount , which mediators have said is not an option because the election documents have been in the custody of his supporters			2
mediators will return to @entity1 in the near future , but a date has not been set , @entity71 said			0
@entity2 's @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 and journalist @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
