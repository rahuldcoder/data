, and action - thriller paycheck - coaster			1
" the november man , " which reunites @entity3 with his " @entity16 " director , @entity15 , falls squarely but surely in the last category			1
box office preview : summer 2014 goes out with a sigh @entity3 plays boozehound and @entity22 agent @entity21 , who is coaxed out of retirement to stop a conspiracy involving a war criminal ( @entity26 )			1
he 's also asked to protect a relief worker ( @entity27 , a former @entity4 girl of the @entity29 era ) who holds more secrets than anyone could guess -- except the audience , that is -- while ducking a past protege ( the stiff - as - a - board @entity36 ) who chases him in some rather meh cat - and - mouse power play			2
( there 's even an actual cat that makes some cameo appearances			0
) is @entity43 the prescription for @entity46 's ' @entity45 ' ? the movie , based on @entity49 's popular spy novel series , could easily have been made in @entity3 's @entity50 days , with its fondness for familiar ' 80s action tropes like smashed bmws and heavy arterial spray			1
once in a while , there 's a certain drive - in / double feature junkiness that elicits a chuckle or two ( especially any scene with an oily officioso played by the growling @entity61 , the only performer who seems to be having any fun )			0
but the utter lack of originality eventually sinks the movie , and the climax has more howlers than a wolf convention			0
" the november man " may be an august release , but its silliness would make it a non-event any month of the year			2
