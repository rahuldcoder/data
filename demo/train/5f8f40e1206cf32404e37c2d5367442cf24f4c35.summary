-- western intelligence agencies were able to form a detailed picture of @entity6 's movements in the years after 9/11 , and came closer to capturing or killing him than has so far been acknowledged , a former @entity2 intelligence official has disclosed			1
the former official , who declined to be identified , told @entity0 that in 2003 and 2004 an informant in the @entity12 - @entity11 border region with close connections to @entity15 's top leadership provided a stream of reliable information on @entity6 's movements			1
but the information was never quite fresh enough for @entity20 intelligence agencies to target @entity15 's leader			1
nearly nine years ago , @entity6 and others in the @entity15 leadership escaped as their haven among the caves and mountains of @entity27 -- close to the @entity12 border with @entity11 -- came under withering @entity30 air attacks			2
despite @entity6 being the world 's most sought - after fugitive , to date very little has been reliably reported about his movements beyond a consensus that he is now likely hiding somewhere in the tribal areas of @entity11			1
the former official said that in the period after @entity6 left @entity27 , under pressure and on the run , he and his lieutenants were little able to communicate with each other			0
but gradually , @entity15 restored its communications and was able to resume meetings			0
@entity6 even met with 9/11 mastermind @entity43 at some point before the latter 's arrest in february 2003			2
additionally , @entity6 and his deputy @entity47 were frequently in the same area and regularly in communication			0
during this time , @entity20 intelligence agencies were able to draw up a detailed map tracing @entity6 's movements , according to the former intelligence official			1
in 2003 - 2004 , @entity6 spent time in several areas -- amid the rugged mountains of @entity11 's @entity53 and in @entity11 's @entity55 , a more heavily populated area where @entity11 's security forces had a greater presence			1
but according to the former official , @entity6 shunned big cities , preferring to stay in rural areas			2
the intelligence stream indicated that @entity15 's leader also made several trips across into @entity12 during this period , despite the presence of tens of thousands of @entity30 troops			0
in a high - stakes game of hide - and - seek , @entity20 intelligence agencies were always playing catch - up as @entity6 moved from location to location			1
tantalizingly at one point , according to the former official , information about his exact location was only one week old			0
but the intelligence stream on @entity6 's movements never resulted in what is known as " actionable intelligence " that could have led to his capture or assassination			1
after 2004 the intelligence stream dried up , according to the former official , who did not elaborate why			2
but he said that despite the setback , information on @entity15 's leaders ' movements never completely dried up ; and recent intelligence suggested @entity6 and @entity47 were still in close geographic proximity and able to communicate with each other			1
however , few @entity15 followers get to meet them			0
@entity2 and @entity30 jihadists who joined up with @entity15 in 2008 have subsequently told @entity20 interrogators that for security reasons access for them to @entity6 was strictly off limits			2
@entity6 is now mainly concentrating on providing " strategic direction " to the @entity15 organization , rather than involving himself deeply in the daily running of the terrorist organization , the former official told @entity0			0
raw intelligence reports leaked in july on the @entity102 website suggesting @entity6 took part in detailed planning of operations should be treated with skepticism , said the former official			2
@entity30 intelligence officials play down the possibility that @entity6 might be captured soon			0
cia director @entity109 stated in june that very little hard information on @entity6 's movements had come to light in recent years			1
but on friday , president @entity113 said that pressure on the @entity15 leadership meant that " they have been holed up in ways that have made it harder for them to operate			0
" he added : " @entity6 has gone deep underground			0
even @entity47 , who is more often out there , has been much more cautious			0

a former @entity2 intelligence official offers details on @entity6 's movements after 9/11
in 2003 and 2004 @entity20 *authorities* had " a stream of reliable information " on @entity6
but the information was never fresh enough for agencies to take action
the intelligence consensus is that @entity6 is now hiding in the trial areas of @entity11
