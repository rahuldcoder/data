president @entity0 formally opened his re-election bid saturday with two rallies in which he highlighted accomplishments over his three and a half years in the @entity4 and argued that @entity5 ca n't afford to adopt @entity7 ' " bad ideas			1
" " we are making progress and now we face a choice , " said the president , at his first rally at the @entity10 on the campus of the @entity12 in @entity13			1
" this is a make or break moment for the middle class , and we ca n't turn back now			0
" in this 36 - minute - long address , @entity0 said presumptive @entity7 presidential nominee @entity22 would " rubber stamp " the congressional @entity7 agenda , telling the crowd that " we can not give him that chance			1
" " that 's the choice in this election , and that 's why i 'm running for a second term as president of the @entity5 , " added @entity0			1
the speech highlighted the narrative that the @entity0 campaign hopes to push this year : reminding voters how many millions of jobs were lost before the president took office			1
the president said that in the final six months of 2008 , " nearly three million of our neighbors lost their jobs			0
" but he said when he took office , " we did n't quit			0
together we are fighting our way back			0
" @entity0 touted the federal government 's rescue of the big auto companies , and he criticized his challenger , saying " when some wanted to let @entity50 go bankrupt , we did n't turn our backs			1
" " today , @entity5 's auto industry is on top of the world , " he said			0
the @entity55 - born @entity22 , whose father was a former auto executive and governor of that state , opposed the bailout , saying a structured bankruptcy could have achieved the same result without the massive cost to the @entity5 government			2
moreover , the former @entity65 governor has argued the @entity0 administration made too many concessions to auto unions as part of that bailout			2
the president also touted his foreign policy achievements , saying that " for the first time in nine years , there are no @entity5 fighting in @entity75			0
" he said that " @entity76 is no longer a threat to this country , " and " @entity79 is on the path to defeat			0
" he then pledged that " by 2014 , the war in @entity84 will be over , " and pointed out that @entity22 had opposed setting a troop withdrawal deadline in that conflict			2
on the controversial issue of illegal immigration , @entity0 declared , " it 's time to stop denying citizenship to responsible young people just because they 're the children of undocumented immigrants			2
" @entity22 took a hard stance against illegal immigration during the @entity7 primaries , opposing the president 's push for a limited pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants			1
the issue is of importance to the growing @entity102 electorate in the @entity5			0
the @entity104 arena , which holds around 20,000 people , appeared to be around two - thirds to three - quarters full , with around half of the seating in the upper deck empty			2
the @entity13 fire department estimated the crowd size at 14,000			0
while smaller in size than many @entity0 rallies during the 2008 campaign , the crowd dwarfed the size of any rally held this cycle by @entity22			1
the presumptive @entity7 nominee 's campaign quickly reacted to the president 's speech			0
" the fact remains that @entity5 families are struggling on his watch : to pay their bills , find a job and keep their homes			0
while president @entity0 all but ignored his record over three and a half years in office , the @entity5 people wo n't			1
this november , they will hold him accountable for his broken promises and ineffective leadership , " @entity22 campaign press secretary @entity133 said in a statement			2

@entity104 's unemployment level stands at 7.5 % , slightly lower than the national average of 8.1 %			2
@entity104 has become a crucial battleground state in recent presidential elections			1
the @entity104 put president @entity146 over the top in his 2004 re-election			1
four years ago , @entity0 won @entity104 by five percentage points over sen. @entity150 of @entity151			1
the most recent public opinion poll in @entity104 , released earlier this week by @entity153 , indicated a tie between @entity0 and @entity22			1

the president 's two - point margin was well with in the poll 's sampling error			0
acknowledging that his re-election bid faces hurdles , the president told those in the audience that " @entity104 , this election will be closer than the last			1
" and while he continuously talked about moving " forward " -- his 2012 campaign slogan -- in his speech , he did hark back to his 2008 slogan			0
" if people ask what this campaign is about , you tell them it 's still about hope , it 's still about change , " said @entity0			2
after the @entity104 speech , the president went to @entity179 , another crucial battleground state , and held a rally on the @entity182 campus of @entity183			1
the @entity185 successful men 's basketball coach @entity184 hosted the event at the school 's @entity187			0
a fire marshal said that about 8,000 people were in attendance , filling the arena to capacity according to the @entity0 campaign			2
first lady @entity195 introduced her husband , telling the crowd , " we 've come so far			0
we 've got so much more to do			0
" the president then took the stage , offering a speech much like the one he 'd made hours earlier in @entity104			1
he pointed to the " progress " made during his first term , and suggested @entity22 and " his friends " were delusional if they " think that the same bad ideas will lead to a different result			0
" @entity0 ended his speech trying to fire up his supporters to " stick with me , fight with me , and press on with me			0
" " if you 're willing to work even harder in this election than in the last election , i guarantee you we will move this country forward , " he told the @entity182 crowd			0
" we will finish what we started			0
