-- nothing is funnier than sex			1
in all the fretting over teens having babies and ranting against abortion , we forget about the night the bed broke , or the trouble we had pushing the dog off the couch , or even the laugh we had at age 11 when we stole our big sister 's list of words for vagina			0
( " @entity18 " ? really ? ) for reasons religious and political , certain @entity19 have turned what is one of the most natural and silliest of experiences into a sermon			1
as in , do n't do it until you 're married			0
young people , ages 18 to 29 , are simply ignoring this			1
according to a national survey by the @entity32 , almost 90 % of unmarried young adults have had sex , and most are sexually active			1
this horse is not only out of the barn , it 's down the road and having a long drink of water			0
and the cowboys and cowgirls trying to rope the horse back in would do better to turn their attention to an issue they might be able to do something about : promoting contraception			2
single @entity19 women in their 20s have one of the highest unplanned pregnancy rates in the world : seven out of 10 , to be exact			1
five out of 10 such pregnancies result in births			2
consequences for the young parents and their children can be severe : stalled educational opportunities and serious health and school problems , among others			2
the latest major player to focus attention on pregnancy prevention is the @entity67 , the organization that , 67 years ago , brought us @entity69 and fire prevention and later , produced such notables as car crash dummies @entity72 and @entity74 and the phrase " friends do n't let friends drive drunk			1
" the @entity67 recently began offering 33,000 media outlets -- digital , tv , radio , outdoor and print -- the opportunity to run for free a series of short ads encouraging 20 - somethings to use birth control			1
of course , unplanned pregnancy is a serious problem in this country , council president @entity90 said in an interview , similar to others the council has tackled , such as such as childhood obesity , gay and lesbian bullying , and dating abuse			1
" frankly , we do n't take on many new campaigns , " @entity90 said			0
" we get hundreds of requests and take on maybe three to five a year			0
we felt very strongly that educating young women about birth control is a straightforward proposition			1
the campaign is exclusively about what options you have if you decide you 're going to have sex and do n't want to get pregnant			1
it 's really education in prevention , as simple as that			0
" the public service announcements are n't on a par with comedian @entity120 ' @entity119 , but they do make any sex jokes we parents make look incredibly lame			2
in one of them , two partners struggle to remove jeans that are fashionably skinny			0
in another , the slippery shower stall poses a problem			0
in yet another , a passionate couple is interrupted by a voyeur : a black and white great dane - boxer mix with a disapproving stare			0
( no worries : i 'm not spoiling anything here			0
the ads , created by the @entity140 agency @entity139 , are way funnier than i am			0
) at the end of each spot , viewers are directed to the website www.bedsider.org , which also uses humor to help visitors compare 15 kinds of contraception , locate the closest place to acquire various methods , set up regular birth control reminders , and watch videos of real women sharing birth control experiences , including women who are not having sex			1
animated shorts on the site debunk sex myths			2
as in , is it possible for a guy to be too big for a condom ? one click on a drawing of a dachshund , entitled " 2 big 2 fit , " brings up the answer			0
want advice for better sex ? the site has that , too , for example , " warming the feet can increase your chance of orgasm by 30 %			2
" who knew ? @entity176 is a project of @entity178 to prevent teen and @entity180 , a nonprofit organization that bid last year for the coveted @entity67 support			1
the project is being funded -- to the tune of several million dollars -- by a private foundation that the campaign says has no connection to the pharmaceutical industry			2
the teen pregnancy rate has declined nearly 40 % over the past two decades , but rates of unplanned pregnancy among young adults have remained stubbornly high			1
this stagnation compelled @entity195 , the @entity178 's ceo , to seek fresh thinking , including help from @entity198 , a @entity199 - based design firm whose clients include @entity203 shoes and the smartphone alternative @entity204			2
" we need to rebrand contraception as something that promotes self - determination , education and achievement , " @entity195 said			2
not everyone will agree with @entity195 , of course			0
recently , several conservative @entity214 lawmakers attempted to rebuke the concept of contraception as an endorsement of " consequence - free sex " that will bring about a " pagan society , " and said it uses public funding to prevent a generation from being born			1
( i am not making this up			0
see @entity225 correspondent @entity224 's broadcast			0
) the problem is not contraception , dear @entity19 rep. @entity229 and others ; it 's not taking advantage of contraception			1
fewer than half of the young adults surveyed by @entity234 said they used birth control carefully and consistently			1
i confess i have some difficulty understanding why so many young couples today do n't use birth control faithfully			2
when women of my generation moved into adulthood , we had very few people to talk to about sex and only a couple of choices of birth control			1
illegal and dangerous abortions were common			0
so it 's easy for us to mutter something like , " do n't these young women know how lucky they are ? " well no , many of them do n't			1
nor should we expect them to			0
what we can do is recall what it was like to do a little mattress dancing at their age , and how concerns about school or friends or the possibility of getting pregnant could keep us from really enjoying ourselves			0
few things in life feel as good as good sex , especially with a loving partner			0
and today , just as in the past , young people often have to brush away a bunch of pesky thought - gnats to enjoy it			0
the fear of pregnancy no longer need be one of those pests , and bravo to the @entity67 for reminding us all of that			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .			1

@entity282 : sermons against having sex *ineffective* ; almost all young adults have sex
@entity19 has one of the highest unplanned pregnancy rates for single young women , she says
@entity280 : the smartest way to prevent *unwanted* pregnancies is to promote contraception
@entity280 : @entity67 campaign uses fresh approach of humor and website to help
