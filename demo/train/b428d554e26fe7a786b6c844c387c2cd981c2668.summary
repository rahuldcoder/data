-- after years of near - silence , @entity1 gives a rare extensive print interview in the new issue of @entity0 , on stands and available through @entity6 on october 28th			1
in the q&a , @entity1 opens up to senior writer @entity8 about the ups and downs of his long career , his possible return to stand - up , his @entity15 hosting plans and much more			1
@entity1 , who co-stars in the upcoming " @entity16 , " is baffled by his reputation as a near - recluse : " i leave my house all the time , " he says			1
" but i 'm not at all the @entity21 parties			2
i 'm grown , and where else am i supposed to be ? i 'm supposed to be home			2
if i were out in the clubs every night , they 'd be saying , ' that 's a shame , look at him , 50 years old , he 's still out at these clubs			2
' @entity30 are nasty , with long nails , do n't wash their a * *			1
. i 'm too vain to be a recluse			2
i 'm 50 years old , beautiful house , i 'm supposed to be home , chilling			2
" @entity1 says that his days of making family movies may be over			1
" i do n't have any interest in that right now , " he says			1
" there 's really no blueprint , but i 'm trying to do some edgy stuff			2
and i only want to do what i really want to do , otherwise i 'm content to sit here and play my guitar all day			2
i always tell people now that i 'm a semiretired gentleman of leisure , and occasionally i 'll go do some work to break the boredom up			2
" @entity1 has decided not to make " @entity47 " " they 're not doing it , " he says			1
" what i 'm trying to do now is produce a tv show starring @entity53 's son , and @entity53 is the chief of police now in @entity55			2
i 'd do the pilot , show up here and there			0
none of the movie scripts were right ; it was trying to force the premise			0
if you have to force something , you should n't be doing it			1
it was always a rehash of the old thing			0
" unlike other " @entity69 " alumni , @entity1 has refused to participate in retrospectives and has n't been on the show in years -- but he 's gotten over his grudge			1
" they were s * * * * * to me on ' @entity69 ' a couple of times after i 'd left the show , " he says			0
" they said some s * * * * * things			0
there was that @entity81 sketch [ when @entity81 showed a picture of @entity1 around the time of " @entity84 " and said , ' look , children , a falling star ' ]			1
i made a stink about it , it became part of the folklore			0
what really irritated me about it at the time was that it was a career shot			0
. i felt s * * * * * about it for years , but now , i do n't have none of that			1
" @entity1 has n't performed stand - up since the late 1980s , but recently , he 's given some thought to trying again			1
" if i ever get back onstage , i 'm going to have a really great show for you all , " he says			0
" an hour and a half of stand - up and about 40 minutes of my s * * * * * band			1
but i have n't done it since i was 27 , so why f * * * with it ? but that 's just weighing both sides			1
it comes up too much for me to not do it again			0
it 's like , when it hits me , i 'll do it , eventually			0
" @entity1 addresses reports that he stormed out of the @entity15 after losing the best supporting actor award to @entity118			1
" @entity118 's performance in ' @entity120 ' is @entity15 - worthy , it 's a great performance			1
that 's just the way the s * * * went			0
he 's been gigging for years and years , the guy 's in his seventies			0
i totally understood and was totally cool			0
i was n't like , ' what the f * * * ? ' afterward , people were like , ' he 's upset , ' and i 'm like , ' i was n't upset ! ' what happened was after i lost , i 'm just chilling , and i was sitting next to @entity132 © 's pops , and he leans over and grabs me and is like , [ solemn voice ] ' there will be other times			1
' and then you feel @entity139 on your shoulder going , ' it 's all right , man			0
' then @entity142 walks by : ' hey , guy			0
' so i was like , ' it 's not going to be this night ! ' [ mimes getting up ] i did n't have sour grapes at all			1
that 's another reason i wanted to host the show -- to show them that i 'm down with it			0
