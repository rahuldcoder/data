-- the @entity3 undersea gusher is the largest oil spill in @entity6 history -- possibly already more than twice as big as the @entity7 , government estimates suggested thursday			1
scientists observed 130,000 to 270,000 barrels of oil on the water 's surface on may 17 , and think a similar amount had already been burned , skimmed , dispersed or evaporated			1
that would mean 260,000 to 540,000 barrels had leaked as of 10 days ago			0
the @entity15 leaked about 250,000 barrels into @entity18 's @entity17 in 1989			1
the busted well is spewing oil at a rate of at least 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day , @entity20 chief @entity19 told reporters thursday			0
a barrel of oil has 42 gallons , so that 's 504,000 to 798,000 gallons a day			0
that 's more than twice as much as previous estimates , which put the rate at 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , per day			0
it 's also the more conservative estimate of two reached by two separate teams of government scientists who used two different methods , @entity19 told reporters thursday			1
one team looked at the oil on the surface and came up with the estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day			1
a second team used a different method and came up with a range of 12,000 to 25,000 barrels per day , @entity19 said			0
the official estimate uses the range where the estimates overlap			2
the lower end of the government estimate -- 12,000 barrels per day -- would mean that about 18.6 million gallons of oil has been spilled since the april 20 oil rig explosion that started the leak			1
the higher end -- 19,000 barrels per day -- would mean 29.5 million gallons has been spilled			0
the @entity15 spilled about 11 million gallons of oil			1
worldwide , there have been more than a dozen bigger oil spills than the @entity3 spill			1
the worst was the destruction of @entity61 terminals and tankers by @entity64 's forces during the @entity65 , which spilled 240 million gallons , according to the @entity66			0
the amount of oil spilled could have very specific financial ramifications for @entity70			1
if the government finds the company negligent or the leak avoidable , @entity70 will owe royalties on the lost oil , @entity72 spokesman @entity71 told @entity0			1
" now we know the true scale of the monster we are fighting in the @entity3 , " said @entity78 , senior vice president of the @entity79			2
" @entity70 has unleashed an unstoppable force of appalling proportions			2
it 's as if two @entity15 tankers have already run aground , and more are on the way if they do n't get this hole plugged			2
" this independent government estimate shows what we expected all along -- @entity70 can not be trusted , because every gallon of oil that is spilled means they will pay more in fines and liability , " @entity78 said			1
the estimates are preliminary and based on new methodologies , @entity19 said in a teleconference			0
the first team , which got the lower estimate , analyzed how much oil was on the surface of the @entity3 on a given date , using aerial imaging			1
they estimated that " 130,000 to 270,000 barrels ( were ) on the surface of the @entity3 on may 17 , " @entity19 said			2
" we estimate that , in addition , as of may 17 a similar volume of oil had already been burned , skimmed , dispersed or evaporated , " she said			2
that led those scientists to the range of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day			0
the second group used video observations to arrive at the higher figure			0
the scientific teams were composed of federal scientists , independent experts and representatives from universities around the country , @entity19 said			0
@entity70 , which owns the well , was not involved except to provide raw data , she said			0
@entity0 's @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , and @entity0 's @entity127 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 spill *significantly* larger than @entity15 *accident* of 1989 , estimates indicate
government scientists estimate oil gushing much *faster* than previously thought
two teams used different methods to estimate flow
new : amount of oil spilled could have ramifications if @entity70 is found negligent
