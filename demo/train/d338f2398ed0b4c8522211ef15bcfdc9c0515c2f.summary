-- a federal agency in charge of safety on the roads wants an outright ban on using mobile phones while driving			1
but what if we 're just too hooked on our smartphones and other digital gadgets to care ? for many drivers in 2011 , a phone is as vital an in - car accessory as a radio , a map or a cup holder			2
spend a few minutes watching motorists backed up at a traffic light and you 'll see a large chunk of them on their smartphones : talking , texting , peering at a digital map or playing " @entity25			2
" enough , says the @entity26 , which on tuesday issued its most sweeping recommendation on mobile - phone use yet -- that all nonemergency talking , texting or other use by drivers be made illegal			1
that would include hands - free devices as well as handheld ones			1
there seems to be across - the - board agreement , even on the part of some self - admitted offenders , that a ban on drivers using their hands to text and talk makes sense			1
but after that , things get more complicated			0
and some critics are saying that any law targeting phone use in cars is already too late			2
" mobile phones are omnipresent			2
virtually every adult and many kids have one , " @entity53 auto columnist @entity52 wrote wednesday			1
" no law will change the fact that people expect to remain in touch while they 're behind the wheel			1
" the @entity26 's proposed ban , he said , would be " the most pointless and universally ignored law since @entity64			1
" " imagine the old 55 - mph speed limit , only without radar detectors , " he wrote			2
in the @entity68 , more than 35 % of adults own a @entity70 - enabled smartphone and more than 83 % own a mobile phone of some kind , according to a recent @entity74 study			2
at any given daylight moment , some 13.5 million @entity68 drivers are on handheld phones , according to a study released last week by the @entity79			0
some 3,092 roadway fatalities last year involved distracted drivers , although the actual number may be far higher , the @entity79 said			0
federal officials have taken to calling phone use behind the wheel " the new dui			0
" @entity87 of @entity88 , @entity89 , says he does n't use his phone while actively driving			0
but at stoplights , he admitted , he 'll do everything from texting and checking e-mail to reading news stories , checking @entity95 and posting to @entity96			0
" i like to be able to maximize the use of my time , " he said			0
" i do n't see there being a big harm in multitasking when my car is stopped so long as i maintain awareness of what traffic around me is doing			0
" many @entity106 readers who responded to a call for thoughts on the issue said they do n't understand a distinction the @entity26 plan makes between phones and systems that come installed in cars , like @entity116 's @entity115 , which enables voice calls , online music services and other phone - like features			1
" i make and receive phone calls via my hands - free equipment and i use the phone for gps navigation			1
all of this i could do freely if i have the right optional extras in my car , " said @entity125 of @entity126 , @entity127			0
" should radios and gps navigation also be banned from cars ? laws exist in most states banning texting and making phone calls without hand - free equipment -- the issue is that these laws are not being enforced			1
" the use of mobile gps also was mentioned frequently by both readers and online pundits			0
virtually every mobile operating system has some sort of mapping app to help drivers get from @entity147 to point @entity148 what sense does it make , the logic goes , to ban phones in the car while allowing apps that are created , almost exclusively , to be used in the car ? " ( @entity159 ) iven that @entity160 is now an integral part of most smartphones , and that services like @entity164 integrate voice commands to phones via @entity167 , it 's not clear how effective or enforceable a total ban would be -- or whether it would change the behavior of drivers in a significant way , " wrote @entity156 for tech blog @entity157 , a @entity0 content partner			1
" bans on handheld phone use have n't significantly reduced the likelihood of drivers to take incoming calls while they 're driving regardless of the type of phone they have			0
" a bigger safety issue could arise , @entity125 said , if such tools are banned			0
" if cell phones are banned , those of us without gps installed in the car will need to revert back to paper maps or printed directions , " he said			0
which is more dangerous , listening to my phone 's gps navigation or reading a set of printed instructions ? let 's be honest , before @entity160 when everyone used maps , did we all pull over to the side of the road to read the next instruction once we reached a waypoint ? if used correctly , these devices are improving safety			1
" any ban on cell phone use in cars probably would n't become law for a while			2
the @entity26 does n't have any lawmaking power and @entity210 would have to pass any law regarding phones and driving , although the safety board has helped push ideas into law before			1
getting such a law through @entity210 , given the current gridlock in @entity218 , could be a torturous process			0
currently a patchwork of laws governs cell phone usage by drivers			0
some 35 states ban text messaging while driving , 30 states ban cell phone use by novice drivers , and 10 ban all use of handheld cell phones , according to the @entity26 .			1

federal board suggests a ban on phones while driving , but many balk at the idea
many support banning texting while driving , but say hands - free , @entity160 should remain legal
auto *industry* columnist says law would be " most ignored since @entity64 "
