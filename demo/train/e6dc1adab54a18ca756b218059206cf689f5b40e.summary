-- it 's becoming a familiar routine			2
the @entity3 turn up in @entity5 's speed skating arena and duly finish first , second and third			1
once might be notable , twice impressive but when it happens for the fourth time , onlookers are simply left shaking their heads and wondering how it 's possible			1
as they did again on tuesday when @entity13 took gold in the men 's 10,000m in a new @entity18 record of 12 minutes 44.45 seconds , ahead of @entity19 and @entity20			1
the @entity3 have now taken 19 of the 27 medals on offer in speed skating , with their 20th medal also coming in the @entity25 -- in the short track			1
no other country has won more medals at these games			2
" what is the secret ? everybody is asking , " @entity32 , who won speed skating gold over 1,000m last week , told @entity0			1
" i do n't think there 's one particular secret			2
the competitive model in @entity38 is really high			2
it 's really hard to qualify for the @entity18			2
we have some more amazing teammates who have stayed at home because they did n't qualify			2
" i also think it 's a kind of coincidence that everything is coming together at these games , because at recent @entity47 we have n't been dominating so much			2
" but everyone is doing it here - and that 's awesome			2
it 's a great feeling that so many people in the @entity3 team are doing great , so there 's a really nice environment in the village			1
" to find an indication as to why the @entity3 are so dominant at the @entity18 , one need only visit the history of speed skating page on the @entity61 's website			1
" the @entity3 were arguably the earliest pioneers of skating , " the @entity61 writes			1
" they began using canals to maintain communication by skating from village to village as far back as the 13th century			2
" the first known skating competition is thought to have been held in the @entity3 in 1676 ... in 1889 , the @entity3 hosted the first @entity69			1
" so it 's no surprise when @entity32 describes the sport as second only to football in terms of popularity among the @entity3			1
meanwhile , @entity76 gave a humorous indication of what drove him to bronze			2
" i 'm really happy			0
i did n't want to be the only ( @entity3 ) guy without a medal at these games , " he said			1
" it 's unbelievable how many medals the @entity3 team has taken from these @entity82			1
we 've already doubled the medals from the @entity88			0
" it 's not only in @entity38 that you can make money in speed skating			1
if you qualify for the @entity94 , the government can pay you good money			0
you can live for your skating			2
" @entity97 in an event delayed a day by @entity5 's poor weather on monday , @entity99 @entity98 won gold in the men 's snowboard cross , ahead of @entity106 's @entity105 and @entity108 @entity107			1
@entity109 was constantly trading the lead position with @entity105 but won gold after an enormous final jump			0
his victory contravened medical convention , with @entity98 having torn his anterior cruciate ligament in december -- an injury that normally takes six months to heal			1
" when i passed the finish line i think i was still up in the air ( from the last jump ) , " joked @entity98			1
" i had a knee three times the ( normal ) size and did my cruciate ligament			0
what 's happening to me is just incredible			0
" @entity105 , meanwhile , said he would be retiring after the @entity82 despite being just 22 , while @entity108 @entity107 celebrated a remarkable rise after working as a wax technician for the @entity108 team four years ago			0
" it 's definitely been really tough , but i remember how hard it was for me back then and i use that as motivation to get myself where i am today , " said the 27 - year - old			2
another @entity108 celebrating on tuesday was @entity132 , who will forever stay in freestyle skiing halfpipe history after winning the inaugural event at the @entity18			0
the 23 - year - old won the day 's last medal event , ahead of @entity138 's @entity137 and @entity139 of @entity99			1
@entity140 finds way earlier on tuesday , @entity142 's @entity141 made light of tricky weather conditions to become only the second woman in @entity18 history to win both the downhill and giant slalom			1
having won the downhill last week , the 30 - year - old finished seven hundredths of a second ahead of @entity153 's @entity152 , who won gold in saturday 's super-g , with @entity156 of @entity157 taking bronze			2
i was ready for this , it 's what i came here to do , " said @entity141 , who emulates the feats of @entity162 's @entity161 in @entity163 in 1972			1
i think i will realize what i have done many years later			0
" @entity141 , who won two silvers at @entity88 , is now the most successful @entity170 in either the summer of winter games in @entity142 's history -- with a total of four			1
less successful but still celebrating was @entity175 's @entity174 , better known as world - famous violinist @entity174			1
competing under the name of her @entity175 father , the 35 - year - old placed last of the 67 skiers who finished -- some 50 seconds behind @entity141			1
" you can insure yourself up to your eyeballs , but if you do n't take risks , what 's the point ? " she said in response to a question about the possibility of damaging her arms			0
" you have to enjoy life			0
i nearly crashed three times , but i made it down and that was the main thing			0
" @entity198 @entity199 did celebrate one medal on tuesday , as @entity202 's women won the 3,000 meter relay in another extraordinary final			0
four years ago , the @entity202 thought they had won gold in @entity206 only to be disqualified for impeding -- a decision which promoted @entity208 to gold			0
on tuesday , the roles were reversed as @entity202 passed the defending champions on the last of the 27 laps to take the gold , with the @entity208 -- who thought they had bagged silver -- later disqualified for impeding on the final lap. " we were disqualified at the last @entity18 and today we picked up the gold medal we left behind back then , " said team member @entity217			0
" only two people from our current team competed in @entity206 , and the younger skaters really stepped up this time			0
" @entity138 won silver as a result of @entity208 's disqualification while @entity226 completed the podium			0
" i could n't stop smiling			0
it was amazing , " said @entity229 after her unexpected bronze			0
@entity232 in the men 's biathlon , which had been postponed from monday because of fog , @entity234 's 11 - time world champion @entity233 won the third @entity18 gold of his career			1
organizers needed a photo finish to determine whether @entity233 had beaten fast - finishing @entity99 @entity242 , who has already won two golds in @entity5 , over the line , with both contestants finishing with the same time			1
" i feel very many thoughts but most of all very happy , " said @entity233			0
" it was a very tight finish , but i had some power left			0
i had been saving some power on the last loop			0
it was not a big difference for gold			0
" @entity254 of the @entity255 finished third , meaning @entity234 @entity256 failed in his quest to become the highest medal winner in @entity18 history			1
the 40 - year - old needed just one more medal to surpass the all - time record he shares with compatriot @entity262 but he finished in a disappointing 22nd place			2
he has one more chance in the relays			0
yet @entity234 were not to be denied a medal as @entity267 took gold in the @entity269 , finishing 0.6 seconds ahead of compatriot @entity270			1
" i did n't think i would get to realise this , " said @entity267 after winning his first @entity18 medal of any color			0
" it 's pretty obvious how i feel			0
i can not really tell			0
it 's a bit surreal			0
i will need time to enjoy the moment			0
" @entity279 of @entity157 finished third , while his compatriot @entity280 -- the pre-event favourite -- struggled to shake off the effects of a virus and so finished 10th			0
gold on ice elsewhere , @entity106 kept their dream of winning ice hockey gold alive after beating a limited @entity234 side 4 - 0 to set up a quarterfinal clash with @entity290 on wednesday			1
the @entity106 are desperate to win their first @entity18 gold since the breakup of the @entity293 in 1991 -- having won six of the seven @entity18 prior to that date			1
although @entity106 formed part of the ' @entity298 ' that won gold in 1992 , the success was not theirs alone since they counted teammates from @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 among their number			1
despite ice hockey gold seeming to be among the most desired aspects of @entity309 for president @entity310 , the @entity106 are struggling -- having been forced to negotiate the playoffs to reach the last eight after failing to win their group			1
this was , of course , a direct result of failing to beat the @entity108 in saturday 's extraordinarily dramatic match , which the @entity108 won on penalties , and the flag - waving crowd was at capacity in the futuristic @entity322 once again to rally their favorites .			2
