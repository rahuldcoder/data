-- @entity1 said he ignored team orders not to attack @entity4 teammate @entity3 in the closing stages of sunday 's @entity7 @entity6			1
@entity1 , 34 , was sat in third position and closing in on world championship leader @entity3 in second when he was told over the team radio to " maintain the gap " between himself and his @entity12 colleague			1
the result meant @entity3 , 24 , extended his lead at the top of the drivers ' standings to 80 points , despite @entity20 's @entity19 taking the checkered flag to claim the @entity24 marque 's first grand prix victory since october 2010			1
but @entity1 , who is second in the standings , told a post-race press conference he paid no attention to the messages from the team garage			1
passing judgment : @entity31 must stay aggressive " i am not fine with it			0
no. that 's the answer to that , " the @entity33 said when asked if he understood the team 's decision			1
" if @entity19 retires on the last lap we are battling for the victory so i was fine until the end			0
of course i ignored the team as i want to try and get another place			2
@entity45 was doing his best and i was doing my best			0
" i do n't want to crash with anyone , but that was it			0
i tried to do my best with the amount of conversation i had			0
one - way conversation obviously as i was n't talking too much back			0
" there was a lot of traffic coming to me , but i was still trying to do my best to pass the guy in front			0
" @entity19 wins for @entity20 at @entity59 @entity1 took maximum points in last year 's race at @entity59 and , in the wake of his triumph , suggested he was frustrated with a perceived number two driver status at the @entity7 - based @entity4 team			1
when asked if he still felt reigning world champion @entity3 received preferential treatment in 2011 , @entity1 responded : " not really			1
i just want to race to the end , so with four or five laps to the end , they started to chat to me about holding my position			0
" of course , they want the points , but i also need to try and get some more points as well			0
" standings after the @entity7 @entity6 @entity3 , who became the sport 's youngest - ever champion when he clinched the 2010 crown , said he did not feel @entity1 had gifted him his second - place finish			1
" i think we were racing , " said @entity3			1
" it was not a scheduled ' i move right , you move left , i move left , you move right , i brake here , you brake there			0
' " as @entity1 said , he stayed flat out and tried to race me , as hard as he could , did n't find his way past			2
to me , at this stage , it 's quite amusing			2
" rivalries will resume when the @entity94 circus moves to the nurburgring on july 24 for the @entity12 @entity6 .			2
