-- a week into @entity2 's debut on the @entity4 stock exchange , its initial offering price of $ 38 per share dropped to $ 31.91			1
@entity8 investors ' fears deepened as they realize they are losing a lot of money			0
the @entity11 did not follow the usual script			0
instead of launching the largest social media company in the world as a legitimate and valuable business , the @entity11 has laid bare all of the questions and doubts about its potential performance			0
so why did the @entity11 bomb as badly as it did ? in a lawsuit filed last week , some investors contend that @entity23 , the lead underwriter of the ipo , withheld key information about a negative financial forecast from them while sharing it with their institutional clients			1
in this conspiratorial tale , the bad guys are the insiders at @entity2 , the investment bankers and the favored institutional clients of these bankers			1
the bankers set the offering price at $ 38 , knowing that the stock was not worth that much , the insiders in the company unloaded their shares at the offering price and institutional investors stayed on the sidelines			1
individual small investors who bought at the offering price suffered as the price collapsed			2
in other words , the suckers are the rest of the world			0
opinion : was @entity2 ipo a bust ? but i do n't buy this story			1
first , unlike many others who have seen the crises of the last few years as evidence that bankers are evil , i see them more as inept			2
@entity2 's ipo is just proof that if you want something valued , you should not ask a bank to do it			1
none of the actors in this story can be happy with how @entity2 's ipo has unfolded in its first week			1
the investment banks look like bad " deal makers , " which strikes at the heart of one of their few remaining revenue - generating skills			0
any profits or commissions that @entity23 booked on this ipo are overwhelmed by the reputation hit that it took and the consequences this will have on future deals			2
the @entity2 insiders who remain have not only lost billions in value but have made it more difficult to unload their remaining shares down the road			1
and most of the shares at the offering price went to the institutional investors , who now face paper or real losses on those shares			2
@entity11 : outraged investor cries grow louder so , what happened ? i think the investment bankers priced the offering based on how shares of @entity2 were trading in the private market and their assessments of institutional demand			1
i do n't think that revenue growth , margins , risk or any other fundamentals played much of a role in the pricing			2
i do n't fault them for playing the momentum game , but they played it badly			0
by pushing up the offering price to its upper limit and by expanding the offering to allow more insiders to cash out , they broke the spell that momentum casts over investors			0
it would have happened eventually , but they did not anticipate how quickly the shift would occur			0
what are the lessons to take from this mess ? first , do n't assume that bankers , experts and analysts know what they are talking about			1
when they tout an investment , be especially skeptical if they have a stake in it			0
reactions : @entity11 underwhelms @entity133 , too second , much as it soothes the ego to think that your portfolio setbacks are because of a conspiracy , where large institutional clients make a killing and the individual investors get the crumbs from the table , it is institutional clients who lose the most in bad deals because they have more to lose			0
finally , remember that markets make mistakes , and they can make bigger ones after a meltdown like this one			0
i would not be surprised if disappointed investors drive the price down to a point where you and i can have the ultimate revenge on @entity157 : buy his company at a bargain basement price and make money off him			0
