-- during the summer , southeastern @entity2 's high desert is like a furnace where the wind whips hot air over a seemingly endless expanse of arid terrain			1
particles of sand erode and are re-deposited in new areas , collapsing old formations and slowly building sedimentary rock that will hold up new ones			2
the flora and fauna that live amidst those gusts are some of @entity18 's toughest and most resourceful creations , enduring months without a drop of rain and withstanding desert heat and sub-freezing temperatures			1
@entity23 is home to this wildlife as well as the world 's highest concentration of natural sandstone arches			1
from the largest , @entity29 , to the tallest , @entity30 , the park 's 119 square miles are one of the most unique places on earth			1
@entity37 stats : the visitor count at @entity23 has steadily increased since 2004			2
the park drew more than one million guests last year and has averaged that many since 2008			1
the location : @entity23 is located in southeast @entity2 , about five miles north of @entity43			1
there are airports in @entity43 , @entity46 , about four hours away and @entity47 , @entity48 , about two hours away			2
if you go : park admission is $ 10 per vehicle			1
individual admission is $ 5			2
admission is valid for seven days			2
park passports are $ 25 and provide entry to arches , @entity37 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
they are valid for one year			2
the visitor center is open every day except @entity60 , but be sure to check the website as hours change according to the season			2
meet our ranger : @entity66 , an interpretive ranger at @entity23 , grew up in @entity67 , @entity68			2
when she was 11 , her dad started taking her on annual vacations to national parks in the western @entity72			0
the experience had a profound effect on her , she says			0
" i knew i wanted to move west , " says @entity75 , 25			0
" i wanted to be a part of the beauty that you find in national parks			0
" but @entity75 , 25 , became a pre-law student when she moved to @entity46 for college			0
on the way back to school after a 2008 summer internship working for a political campaign , she had her " @entity87 ! " moment , realizing she completed the dream to move west , but not the one to work for the national park service			1
" i just waltzed in to @entity23 visitor center and asked if they needed help , " she says			0
at first , the answer was " no , thanks			0
" but @entity75 says a combination of her stubbornness and a supervisor 's willingness to listen during a 45 - minute impromptu meeting led to her volunteering for six weeks in 2008			1
in 2009 , the supervisor invited her to become a seasonal ranger			0
in 2010 @entity75 became a full - time ranger			1
" it really is the first part of the country that i fell in love with , " she says			0
" there is something about the desert and how hostile , dramatic and colorful it is			1
you have this contrast of something that is incredibly harsh yet unbelievably delicate			0
" for a day trip do n't miss : the @entity119 trail hike			0
@entity75 says the area has the highest concentration of arches in the park , including five that range from 60 to 100 feet high			1
" it 's a nice summary of the park , " she says			1
" it 's the most bang for the buck , if you will			1
" favorite less - traveled spot : hiking to @entity132 from @entity133			0
@entity75 says reaching @entity134 requires driving on a dirt road that will not support rvs or buses			0
it 's about 3.5 miles from @entity133 to tower @entity132 , she says			1
" it 's a great place to escape all the hustle and bustle you find everywhere else in the park , " she says			1
favorite spot to view wildlife : @entity146			1
@entity75 says hot summer temperatures make seeing wildlife difficult			1
but you can see mule deer , coyotes and bobcats at @entity146 as well as big horn sheep near the visitor center from october through december			1
most magical moment in the park : having lunch in the shade of @entity159 the day before it collapsed in august of 2008			1
@entity75 said she was patrolling @entity161 when the temperature hit 105 , and she stopped at @entity159 to rest and eat			0
the next day a group of tourists came into the visitor center and wanted to know why the trail was blocked			0
@entity75 and other rangers went to investigate and discovered the arch had collapsed			0
" i realized geology is always happening , " she says			0
" one sand of grain could have fallen and the whole thing pops and collapses			0
we do n't have any answers as to when ( the arches will fall ) but that is why it is so special to be here now			1
" funniest moment in the park : discovering that five members of a @entity183 o band , dressed in full concert costume , had lugged their instruments three miles to @entity186 and began belting out tunes under its shade			1
( @entity183 ± o music generally comes from northern @entity191 and @entity192			0
it features an accordion that produces musical rhythms similar to polkas			0
) " we informed them they needed a permit ( to play inside the park ) , " she says			1
@entity201 moment at the park : an excited family asking her to identify 10 species of lizards they captured , put in a black box and had planned to take home			1
" i identified all their lizards and promptly made them put them back , " she says			0
it 's illegal to remove wildlife from national parks			1
a ranger 's request : stay on the trails and off the arches			1
the land off the trails is home to biological earth crust which protects against erosion and takes decades to rejuvenate after being stepped on			2
the arches are all made of red sandstone , a mixture of quartz , feldspar and iron oxide			1
while they may look sturdy , they could collapse if you climb on them			0
carry more water than you think you need			0
@entity75 says heat - related illnesses are the no.1 medical issue at the park			2
she recommends you drink a minimum of one gallon of water per day and carry salty snacks to maintain electrolyte levels			0
also , be sure to shake out your shoes before putting them on			0
that 's because scorpions gravitate toward dark , cool spaces			2
if you see a rattlesnake on the trail , do not chase it			0
@entity75 says the majority of rattlesnake bites that happen in the park are on peoples ' hands			2
another park she 'd like to visit : @entity258 in @entity259			2
" i 've never been to @entity259 and i want to see really raw , big mountains , " @entity75 says			0
" i 'm always into the biggest and the best			0
i want to see something that is more primitive than anything else we have ( here )			0
" what national park would you like to visit ? please share your thoughts in the comments section below .			2

the park is home to more than *2,000* sandstone arches
iron oxide creates the *chemical* *reaction* that turns the sandstone red
@entity2 's high desert has scalding summer and freezing winter temperatures
the best time to view wildlife in the park is october through december
