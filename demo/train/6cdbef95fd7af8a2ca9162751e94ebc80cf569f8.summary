@entity0 -- a new credit rating agency backed by @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 firms has launched today in @entity0 , with a mission to displace the " @entity10 " @entity9 firms at the heart of the international ratings system			1
the joint venture , the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) , says it intends to reform the current international credit rating regime , creating the initial framework for a new system by 2020 , with the ability to provide credit risk information on all the world 's economies by 2025			1
@entity25 - based @entity24 , @entity5 's @entity26 and @entity6 - based agency @entity23 are behind the project , which they consider part of a necessary overhaul of a system whose failings contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis			1
currently , ratings issued by the @entity10 -- @entity39 's , @entity40 's and @entity41 -- to large - scale borrowers , such as governments and corporations , play a central role in determining how investors allocate billions of dollars			0
their ratings indicate to buyers of debt how likely they are to be paid back			0
during the financial crisis , the ratings agencies were criticized for giving top ratings to mortgage - backed securities that eventually cratered , sparking a deep global recession			1
@entity52 , president of @entity23 and director of the @entity15 , believes there 's been inadequate reform of the international credit ratings system since the crisis			1
" obviously there 's a been a breakdown of the system , obviously there 's yet to be any sort of tangible reform , " he said			1
" that is really the impetus for seeking some alternatives for global institutional investors			2
" @entity68 , chairman and president of @entity24 and chairman of the @entity15 , said reform was essential to the recovery of the world economy			2
" credit ratings are indispensible in global economic operation , and it is obvious that the current rating system needs reforming and introducing new thinking , " he said in a press release			1
@entity52 said the venture would bring a more international perspective to ratings and provide greater accountability			0
" it 's not going to represent the , you could argue , parochial interests of @entity87 - based firms			0
there 's going to be a variety of perspectives included as a result of a variety of ratings firms being part of it , " he said			0
a " self - policing " mechanism would see contributors ' ratings assessed over time , he said			0
" it addresses the major problem you 've had , whereby if a rating at the triple - a level is issued and quickly downgraded , the rating firm has historically just said ' we 're sorry , but thank you very much for the rating fee			2
' " he said the response to the proposal had been better than he had anticipated			0
" the timing is right , the parties are right , the interest is there , " he said			0
" capital providers in the form of @entity115 and some @entity117 institutions have not had a seat at the table and have been terribly burnt as a result			1
" observers have welcomed the move , saying the new agency could be a viable competitor , but will need time to establish its credibility			2
" i 'm of the view : the more the better , " said @entity129 , senior advisor in the @entity131 's @entity130			0
" anything to introduce greater competition -- it will encourage everybody to have better discipline			0
but i think it will take time for this new rating agency to establish itself			1
" the fact that the agency was giving itself a decent time frame to start up " gives me some comfort that it has a chance to succeed , " she said			2
she rejected the argument that @entity6 - based ratings firms had parochial interests , saying it was " not that black and white , " but agreed that insufficient reforms of the ratings regime taken place since the crisis			1
" perhaps more ratings agencies in the market will promote reform in the long run			0

credit rating agency launched in @entity0 with @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 backing
it seeks to reform the global credit rating system following the financial crisis
director says @entity115 and @entity117 institutions " have not had a seat at the table "
