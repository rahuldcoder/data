@entity1 , @entity0 -- observers who for the first time were allowed to monitor elections in @entity0 said friday that the vote showed a marked improvement from past polls , but there is still some way to go			1
an international team fielded by the @entity12 , made up of 50 observers from 29 countries , highlighted " shortcomings and irregularities , " as well as certain systemic problems			1
" the unequal size of districts and an electoral system that amplifies family , tribal and national cleavages limit the development of a truly national legislative body and challenge @entity27 's stated aim of encouraging ' full parliamentary government , ' " it said			1
but , the institute said , the improvements seen " should give competitors and voters in this and future electoral contests more confidence that their votes are counted fairly and their choices reflected through the election system			2

@entity56 , deputy secretary general of the @entity57 , the political wing of the @entity50 in @entity0 , told @entity2 the election " was as expected -- just a mere copy of the parliament that was dissolved			1
" he disputed the official turnout numbers , but added , " even if they were true , still only one - third of @entity0 participated , so it 's not really representative			1
" more than 3 million @entity0 were eligible to vote for candidates to the new 150 - member @entity68 , officials said			1
@entity27 , speaking at the @entity70 in @entity71 on friday , challenged the criticisms made by the @entity50			1

there were some violent incidents , concentrated in @entity122 , @entity123 , and @entity124 , and some districts in @entity1 -- some within tribes , others between tribes and some concerning individuals , he said			0

we will see there was a lot of rigging of these elections			0
" the international observer missions say that the newly implemented election law is a big improvement on the past , but they say it should be seen only as the beginning of the reform process			2
the law should be reviewed " to encourage political competition and the formation of coalitions and political parties , " the @entity12 said , as well as to bolster the legal framework around the formation of parliament			0
steps are also needed to ensure greater participation of women and young people and to develop the role of election officials , it said			1
