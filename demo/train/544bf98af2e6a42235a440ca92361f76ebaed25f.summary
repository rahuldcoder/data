it has long been said that in war , " truth is the first casualty			0
" it is generally accepted , however , that the @entity5 , the world 's leading democracy , should try to make truth - telling a common practice when it goes to war			2
when gen. @entity11 was @entity5 commander in @entity12 in 2010 he issued guidance to his troops , one of the key points of which was to " be first with the truth			0
" the guidance explained , " avoid spinning , and do n't try to ' dress up ' an ugly situation			0
acknowledge setbacks and failures , including civilian casualties , and then state how we 'll respond and what we 've learned			0
" yet , in @entity26 where the @entity5 has been fighting a small , undeclared war for the past four years , we have now arrived at the ironic point where @entity5 's main enemy there , @entity30 , is doing a better job of truth telling than the @entity5 in a video message released on sunday , a leader of @entity30 in @entity26 apologized for an attack on a hospital in the @entity26 capital of @entity38 earlier this month in which civilians were killed			1
according to the @entity30 leader , the attackers were targeting the @entity26 @entity42 , but one fighter made a mistake and attacked a hospital inside the defense ministry : " we confess to this mistake and fault			2
we offer our apologies and condolences to the families of the victims , " said the @entity30 leader			2
while @entity30 has publicly -- and , no doubt , self - servingly -- apologized for killing civilians at the @entity26 hospital during the attack in @entity38 on december 5 , at the same time @entity5 officials have said nothing publicly about a @entity5 drone strike that took place a week later on a suspected convoy of militants in western @entity26 on december 12			1
the target of this strike turned out to be a wedding party and at least a half dozen civilians are reliably reported to have died			2
this gets to a key problem of the secretive @entity5 drone program			2
its clandestine and unaccountable nature means that when the @entity5 does make a mistake , as it inevitably will , instead of apologizing and making some kind of compensation to the civilian victims of a botched strike -- a common practice when the @entity5 military inadvertently kills civilians in wartime -- @entity5 officials instead say ... nothing			0
or worse , they make claims that the program is somehow perfect and never kills civilians as @entity84 's then top counterterrorism adviser , @entity85 , improbably claimed of the drone program in june 2011 when he said that for almost a year , " there has n't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency , precision of the capabilities we 've been able to develop			1
" @entity85 is now the @entity93 director			0
seeking to redress some of the problems in the drone program , on may 23 president @entity84 gave a major speech about his counterterrorism policies in @entity97 in which he said , " before any strike is taken , there must be near - certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set			2
" did @entity84 's speech and the new policy it sought to inaugurate make any difference to the drone program ? short answer : yes			1
since that speech the @entity84 administration has dramatically cut the number of @entity93 drone strikes in @entity111 and has slightly slowed the number of strikes in @entity26			1
there were 14 drone strikes in @entity111 during the past seven months ; an average of one strike every 15 days			0
in the year before @entity84 's speech , drone strikes happened every eight days			1
and there have been no reliably reported civilian casualties in @entity111 from drone strikes since @entity84 's may speech , according to an analysis of the drone program by the @entity126			1
the pace of drone strikes fell in @entity26 after @entity84 's speech , too , but not as much as it did in @entity111			1
since may 23 , there have been 16 , an average of about one strike every 13 days			0
during the previous year , a strike occurred about once every 10 days			0
it 's worth noting that the civilian death rate has fallen steadily overall in both @entity111 and @entity26 over the past several years , but the strike on december 12 in @entity26 and the civilian casualties it caused is a reminder that there is definitely room for improvement			0
what can be done ? one idea to make the drone program as accountable as possible is to set up an internal @entity5 government body that is independent of the @entity93 and @entity144 that would conduct reviews of the drone strikes after they have occurred			1
one could imagine , for instance , that a small , nonpartisan group of experts on security and law , similar to the group that @entity84 appointed to analyze the activities of the @entity155 , could review the aftermath of drone strikes to examine whether the victims of the strikes were in fact militants who posed some kind of threat to the @entity5			1
such additional oversight would make @entity93 targeters and drone operators all the more diligent to avoid mistakes .			0

an @entity30 leader apologized for hospital attack ; @entity5 mum on drone that hit wedding party
@entity175 says @entity30 *arguably* is doing a better job of truth telling
he says @entity5 needs to make greater accountability a *priority* for drone program
