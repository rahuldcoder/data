-- for two weeks in 1976 , @entity1 was probably the most recognizable person on the planet			2
@entity1 scored seven perfect 10s in @entity4 in 1976			2
just 14 - years - old and standing less than five feet tall , the elfin @entity5 was the undisputed star of that year 's games in @entity4 after becoming the first gymnast in history to score a perfect 10			1
@entity1 finished up with three gold medals and -- just to prove that her initial effort had been no fluke -- seven perfect scores			1
her initial performance on the uneven parallel bars was greeted with uproar as the three - digit scoreboard , struggling to cope with what had been considered an unachievable feat , flashed up 1.00			0
@entity1 finished with four perfect 10s and the gold medal on the bars , but it was on the balance beam , one of gymnastics ' most dangerous disciplines , that @entity1 truly dazzled			1
seemingly fearless , @entity1 pirouetted and back - flipped her way to two more perfect 10s and her second gold			1
her final perfect score came in the floor routine as she also collected first place in the overall competition			0
@entity1 's transformation into an international celebrity -- she appeared on the front covers of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 in the same week -- had been as unexpected as it was sudden			0
yet @entity1 had been working towards the @entity39 ever since she had been picked out as a gymnast of rare talents as a six - year - old growing up in the industrial town of @entity43			1
the reality of life as an @entity39 champion at home in @entity48 's @entity5 however , was not easy			1
constant surveillance comaneci was honored as a @entity50 on her return home , yet the regime -- terrified that @entity1 would defect after enjoying her taste of western celebrity -- kept its greatest star under constant surveillance			1
four years later , a very different @entity1 returned to @entity39 competition in @entity58			1
as an 18 - year - old , she was four inches taller , 20 pounds heavier and suffering from sciatica -- a teenage starlet already starting to fade			0
still , @entity1 was able to retain her gold medal on the balance beam , and collected another one in the floor exercises			2
but she was also involved in one of the bitterest incidents of the @entity7 when she was controversially beaten in the all - round competition by the @entity70 gymnast @entity69			0
it took the judges 28 minutes to decide the result and , ultimately , it was a lower score from the @entity70 judge -- perhaps reflecting the worsening relations between the @entity70 and its formerly loyal satellite -- that denied @entity1 her second straight gold in the event			2
@entity1 retired in 1984 , traveling to @entity80 that year as a team coach , yet she found it difficult to adjust to a life out of the spotlight			0
in 1989 , a few weeks before the collapse of the @entity48 regime , she defected to the @entity87 , finally settling in @entity88 , @entity89 to run a gymnastics school after marrying @entity87 gymnastics star @entity91 in 1996			0
in 2000 @entity1 was named as one of the athletes of the century by the @entity94			0
