-- so your daughter will just die if she does n't wear a princess costume for @entity4 ? and of course it has to be pink			1
and every little girl you know wants to be a princess for @entity4 , except for the neighborhood tomboy down the street ? is this desire to be a princess hardwired ? do girls just come that way , wanting to look pretty in pastels ? and does this explain why teenage and adult women are drawn to " feminine " careers , and likely to be less competitive in sports and at work than their male counterparts ? that 's what some research scientists think			1
they argue that differences between boys and girls are in large part because of variations in hormonal levels during gestation , and thus begin before birth			0
on average , fetuses that become girls are exposed to less testosterone in the womb than those destined to be boys			2
lower exposure to testosterone , some scientists claim , makes girls more passive and less adventurous than boys , and more interested in dressing up , looking nice and pleasing others			1
these scientists admit that some girls embrace a much wider range of interests and behaviors than those that are stereotypically " feminine			2
" but they argue that such girls were exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb			2
the bottom line , according to this school of thought , is that it does n't much matter how parents raise girls			2
their paths are predetermined before birth			0
there 's little point in giving girls gender - neutral toys or encouraging them to think beyond their wedding day			0
most girls will naturally gravitate toward pink princess dresses and white wedding dress fantasies , and most women will avoid traditionally " masculine " activities and aspirations			1
we had a unique opportunity to test this theory by analyzing data that followed 342 women for more than three decades , from when they were still in their mother 's womb as fetuses until adulthood			0
we had measures of how much testosterone each woman had been exposed to in the womb			0
we also had measures of the kinds of messages the girls had received from their parents			1
they had answered questionnaires over the years where they described whether their parents had pushed them toward feminine activities or encouraged them to play with a range of toys , including those traditionally viewed as masculine			0
we found that the level of testosterone exposure in utero did have a small effect on how adult women described their personalities			1
on average , women exposed to more testosterone reported being less passive and were more likely to exhibit " go - getter " personalities			1
but this only explained about 4 % of the differences in the adult women 's personalities			0
far more important , indeed two to three times as important , was what parents had encouraged their daughters to do and be			0
women who were more assertive and confident as adults were much more likely to report that their parents had encouraged them to be active and independent			1
so , by all means , let your daughter be a princess this @entity4 if she insists			1
but also let her know how powerful she looks as a @entity122 rebel leader , a warrior queen , a pirate captain , or even a ninja , because our research suggests that what you say now will have a powerful effect on the options your daughter will envision for herself later in life			0
and if she just has to have that pink dress , just remember that less than 100 years ago , many people thought blue was a more appropriate color for girls than pink , because pink was perilously close to red -- a strong , passionate , and yes , masculine color .			0

@entity142 , @entity143 : are girls hardwired to want pink princess @entity4 costumes ?
they say some scientists think lower testosterone in utero makes girls passive , " girly "
their own study shows the testosterone has less *affect* than messages from parents
*writers* : girls encouraged by parents to be independent , active became assertive women
