-- a @entity2 town has banned people -- let 's face it , young people -- from wearing saggy pants			1
a councilwoman for @entity9 pushed for passage of the law , but the town 's mayor @entity12 may ultimately veto the fashion police			1
if the law goes into effect , it 's unclear what measuring tools the @entity18 would use to determine whether citizens ' pants are within the 2 - inch legal limit of a theoretical waistline			1
it 's even more unclear how they will determine where the waistline actually lies on an individual			0
more likely than not , the @entity28 will use the time - honored legal standard of " i know it when i see it " to eyeball the location of waistlines relative to pants lines			2
the not - too - subtle message is : pull up your pants , because " 2 inches " really just means " too annoying			1
" why do i suggest it singles out young people ? i 'm not ascribing any evil motive to law enforcement			0
rather , as a society , we wo n't expect the police to ticket a plumber crouched over at work , accidentally revealing his tighty - whiteys			1
we 'll expect them to target teens who show underwear as a fashion statement			1
so , the underlying legal question arises : can the government even outlaw saggy pants in the first place ? it 's true that the @entity59 prohibits the government from interfering with our speech -- which is the right to receive and disseminate ideas and information			1
it 's also true that speech need not be spoken or written			0
the @entity59 also protects " expressive conduct			2
" the problem is that expressive conduct is hard to identify			0
clothing can certainly be expressive			2
in 1971 , the @entity70 overturned one man 's conviction for wearing a jacket that said " @entity74 " -- but that 's not really expressive conduct , because the written words constituted speech			0
expressive conduct conveys an idea without words			0
wearing a black armband to school to protest a war is an example of expressive conduct , and the @entity70 has said doing so is protected speech			2
indeed , even offensive clothing , like @entity87 uniforms , has been deemed expressive conduct , and the reviled @entity89 robe has garnered @entity59 protections			2
clothing can be communicative , but courts require an identifiable , specific message to apply @entity59 protection			1
saggy pants proponents would have to show that ( 1 ) displaying your underwear conveys an identifiable message ( 2 ) that the rest of us on the street can understand as an identifiable message			1
well , does n't having one 's pants on the ground convey ideas about comfort , personal style , and individuality ? certainly , but those are not specific enough " messages " for the courts			1
when you think about it , all clothing conveys those ideas			2
in the ' 80s , many of us were conveying strong ideas about acid wash jeans and shoulder pads , and in the ' 90s , our collective message was apparently flannel and work boots			2
but that 's just style -- or lack thereof -- and it 's not enough of a message to be protected speech			1
during the 2013 trial of @entity133 , many took to wearing hooded sweatshirts to show support for @entity136 , who was killed by @entity133 while wearing a hoodie			0
wearing hoodies satisfies the first prong of having a particularized message , but probably fails the second			2
hoodies are so popular that a court might conclude the message of solidarity is indistinguishable on the street from , say , someone wearing a hoodie to the gym			0
in that sense , hoodies would fail the second test , because they are not understood as speech by others			0
the results feel confusing : a court would likely conclude that the clothing of a @entity89 or a neo-nazi conveys a particularized message -- an unpopular , divisive , angry message			1
that would entitle it to constitutional protection			0
but saggy pants ? the message is too amorphous , so it can not be protected speech			1
and if it 's not protected speech , the @entity59 will not prevent towns from outlawing those droopy drawers			0
few of us like looking at people 's skivvies when their jeans hang off them on the subway , but how offensive is it , really ? our culture 's mores about clothing are fundamentally illogical			0
we attempt to outlaw this display of the top half of someone 's boxers , but have no laws for that old guy at the pool -- usually the same guy glistening with suntan oil -- who prances around in nothing but a @entity189 all summer			0
what 's with that guy , anyway ? the point is that culturally , we accept nearly complete nudity in one context , but try to regulate mostly clothed conduct in another			0
there really is no logic to our ideas about clothing			0
that helps to explain horrible fashion choices from decade to decade , but does little to logically justify clothing regulations			1
as much as we feel free to express ourselves with apparel , we likely have less freedom of expression than we imagined			0
and at least in one town in @entity2 , no matter how trendy your gear may be , it looks like it 's time to pull up the pants .			1

@entity213 : @entity2 town passed *legislation* to ban sagging pants
he says this is one fashion statement that courts wo n't say should be protected
@entity213 : @entity223 protects clothing with a specific message that will be *widely* understood
he says saggy pants do n't represent a *political* statement
