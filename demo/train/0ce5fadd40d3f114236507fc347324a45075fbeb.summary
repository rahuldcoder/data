-- here 's what we do know about next week : @entity4 and @entity5 will kick off the annual meeting of the @entity7 in @entity8 on september 21			2
here 's what we do n't know : will they be grandparents yet ? why are we asking right now ? @entity11 first learned that @entity12 was pregnant while she shared the stage with her mother during a women 's event in @entity8 back in april			1
the former first family has not disclosed the due date			1
but if you assume she waited the standard three months to share her news ... three plus april , may , june , july , august ... that makes september the ninth month			1
plus , when she was speaking at another women 's event in @entity25 on friday , @entity5 tried to excite @entity26 about voting in november with this pitch : " now i 've been thinking a lot about family because you know i 'm on ' grandbaby watch ' and i think a lot about this new member of our family and what he or she can look forward to , " she said			2
" and i am well aware that we will do everything possible to prepare this child , to protect this child			2
but i want that for everybody 's child and everybody 's grandchild			2
i want every one of our children to feel that they are inheriting the best of @entity11 , that they have the chance to do what i believed was possible for me and what my husband believed was possible for him and what we instilled in our daughter that really this country is on your side			2
" this country will give you the fighting chance , the fair show you deserves to have			2
this country will give you the level playing field			2
so whether you 're the grandchild of a president , or the grandchild of a janitor , whether you 're born in a city or in a small rural village -- no matter who you are , you have the right to inherit the @entity11 dream			0
" on september 8 , @entity71 was on stage and interrupted an appearance he was making with former president @entity74 to answer a phone that was in his pocket			1
his eyes got big when he looked at the caller id and he said , " only two people in the world have this number and they 're both related to me			0
i hope i 'm not being told i 'm about to be made a premature grandfather			0
" but that was n't the call			0
he and @entity74 went on to discuss grandfatherhood			0
" get ready also to be , like , the lowest person in the pecking order in your family , " @entity74 told @entity71			1
@entity93 also recently alluded to the advanced stage of her pregnancy during an interview with the online magazine @entity97 -- she was plugging a new line of clothes meant to raise awareness about endangered elephants -- where she talked about her own current clothing choices			1
" you 're asking someone who is very pregnant			1
in the here and now , [ i wear ] anything that fits over my belly			0
increasingly , that 's my husband 's t - shirts or button - down shirts , " she said			0
" so , the honest answer in the here and now is a different answer than it would be had you asked me a few months ago , or ask me again in nine months			0
but , for right now , it 's really my husband 's shirts , because they 're the only things that fit me			0
" so we know @entity12 is squarely in the hot zone			0
but we do n't know much else			0
including : is it a boy or a girl ? we do n't know			1
where will the @entity71 baby be delivered ? we do n't know			1
but here are some potential clues : when @entity5 was treated for a blood clot in 2013 , she went to @entity133 on the @entity134 of @entity135			0
when former president @entity71 underwent heart surgery ten years ago , he went to @entity138 , too			1
how will the nursery be decorated ? we do n't know , but in that recent interview on the fashion blog , @entity93 suggested there could be an elephant theme			1
what will the baby be named ? we do n't know			1
but here are some suggestions : first , if it 's a boy , maybe consider pulling a name from one of the 44 presidents			1
@entity154 could be an obvious choice			0
it was in the top five of new baby names , according to the @entity160 's annual survey			1
but what about @entity162 or @entity163 ? those are strong names for @entity26			0
probably not @entity166 , after that 2008 primary			0
if it 's a girl , the name @entity168 is off the table , since that 's what @entity171 named her daughter back in 2013			1
there are n't any former presidents after which to name her			0

@entity93 first *announced* she was pregnant in april , due date could be this month
boy or a girl ? we *'ll* have to wait and see
where will the @entity71 baby be delivered ?
the @entity189 have been fans of @entity138
