-- my earliest memory of ghost stories is borne in a rented cabin on @entity5 , in @entity6 , where my family spent each summer			1
our cabin was rumored to have been built on an @entity11 burial ground and haunted by spirits			0
to a young girl with a wild imagination such as mine , who wanted to be a writer at the age of 7 and who hauled around a blue plastic typewriter wherever she went , these stories made the cabin appealing , because i loved how brave i felt exploring the attic and basement , and more , the knowledge that my father was reading the paper in the next room , and that i could , at any point , race into his arms for a hug and have all my fears assuaged			2
on summer nights , my family sat around the radio and listened to a program that featured one ghost story each night			2
this is still my strongest childhood memory , the only time i recall the members of my family joined together , tied by the intimate chord			0
ghost stories , ironically , made us feel closer to each other , if only for those few savored moments when we 'd share a quilt and perhaps a hand to squeeze			1
tell us your town 's ghost stories ghost stories appear in most cultures			1
there is a @entity11 ghost story about a fire - eating monster with no body , only a head , who snaked through @entity11 villages at night looking for small children to eat			1
this story was told to keep children from staying out late at night			0
perhaps this was the point , also , of the most famous ghost story of my generation : the story of @entity69 , the monster boy who lived in the woods -- our woods , and any other woods where a camp happened to be			1
if memory serves me , the story ended with a melted skull			0
everyone knew @entity69 and that he traveled around			1
at camp , we sat around a blazing fire on cold nights , bundled in our sleeping bags , mashed as close as we could get them , and steeped in woolen long underwear , the cold ground underneath			0
our mouths were ajar , all clamoring for the story , begging our counselors to tell it			0
" @entity91 , tell @entity69 ! " we 'd cry			1
it was a favorite because it was scary but predictable , something that life rarely is			2
no matter how many times we heard it , gripping each other 's hands tightly , the anticipation of @entity69 thrilled us			2
we knew that after the story ended , we would race back to our cabins , high on a rare sort of predictable terror , coveting an adolescent thrill			2
there was anticipation , drama , a predictable climax and our wild screams as the world of @entity69 faded from memory , and we 'd slip safely back into our bunks and tumble into closeness , our bodies falling onto each other , gripping each other 's arms and legs for dear life			1
we found safety and solace on those nights , if only until the next year until we returned to camp , and beg , of course , to hear the story of @entity69 once again			2
to revel in the closeness he allowed us , borne from his tragic life in the woods			2
perhaps this is what we love most about ghost stories			1
they offer us a sense of control over terror , something unattainable in real life			1
perhaps this is why we hang on to them , why we tell them to our children and our grandchildren			0
when we evolve from listener to storyteller , we become elevated in our children 's eyes as we remind them that yes , this is only a story as we watch the same reactions played out around the campfire and realize that though the faces have changed , the reactions are universal			0
ghost stories fill us with fear and dread			1
but then they 're over , and we return to our comfortable lives			2
they help us to bond , become a haven , ride the lost rush of adrenaline and create memories on starry nights with those we love			0
find out the 20 scariest movies of all time we retell ghost stories because we 're rarely alone when we 're listening or telling them			1
stories of the dead and mutilated , it seems , will abate loneliness			0
because there is no better feeling than tumbling into closeness after a good scare			0
for some of us , they are a journey to another place , and they allow us to exorcise the hidden demons and monsters in our own imaginations , to voice them , and maybe to overcome fears			0
ghost stories give us perspective			1
they allow us to escape the everyday			0
living the life of a zombie or existing like @entity69 in the lonely woods , those were real problems			1
@entity69 , @entity191 and the rest of the lot , wandering the @entity194 , stuck in purgatory with an ax to grind , literally			2
maybe our lives were n't so bad after all ? years ago , during my nomadic 20s , my sister and i went camping in the @entity203 , just the two of us , to try to repair our strained relationship			0
we made a fire and told the ghost story of @entity69			1
and after , both of us -- independent , stubborn , strong women bent on finding ourselves -- ran screaming back into our tent and clung to each other for dear life until we fell asleep			0
today , we swear there was something lurking outside our tent for the next hour			0
i have the scars to prove it			0
she dug her nails into my arm so deeply , she drew blood			0
why do we love ghost stories ? because they 're a temporary sort of terror			1
they allow us to return to our world , however imperfect , and ultimately they make us feel better about our lives			1
they send us snuggling into the arms of the person , just moments before , who was perhaps full of flaws , who now feels like our greatest protector			0
ironically , ghost stories take us on a journey of terror that ultimately leaves us feeling safer and less lonely than we had felt before .			1
