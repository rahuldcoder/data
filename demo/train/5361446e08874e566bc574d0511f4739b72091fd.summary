lawyers for @entity2 governor @entity1 filed a motion monday to toss out last month 's grand jury indictment against the potential 2016 presidential contender , arguing that the indictment violated the state 's basic separation of powers			1
they also contended the indictment painted a false picture of the governor as an absolute monarch with personal control of the state 's public coffers			2
" continued prosecution of governor @entity1 on the current indictment is unprecedented , insupportable and simply impermissible , " @entity1 's lawyers wrote in a 43 - page motion filed in @entity19			1
" this attempt to criminalize the political process should not be tolerated by this court or any @entity2 court			0
otherwise , overzealous prosecutors will be given free reign to use the grand jury process to chill political decisions by @entity2 ' governors			2
" @entity1 takes back tweet @entity1 's legal team warned that the " @entity34 does not authorize any such action and the instant indictment is in direct conflict with the governor 's constitutional duties			2
the court should dismiss both counts of the indictment and bar the prosecution			0
" in august , a @entity19 grand jury indicted @entity1 on two felony counts stemming from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by @entity50 district attorney @entity49 , a @entity51 , unless she stepped down			1
the case centers on @entity1 's june 2013 veto of the $ 7.5 million budget for the unit run by @entity49 , after she refused his demand to resign following her drunken driving arrest and conviction			1
up close with @entity1 's @entity61 @entity1 faces accusations of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity in connection with the threat and veto			0
some democrats have argued , among other things , that @entity1 vetoed funding for @entity49 's unit because it was investigating state - funded grants to cancer research projects that benefited allies of @entity1 and @entity2 attorney general @entity77 , this year 's @entity78 gubernatorial nominee			1
4 reasons why @entity1 's exercise of power got him in trouble in their motion , @entity1 's lawyers ridiculed the notion that vetoing spending -- an action preventing the release of tax dollars -- could somehow constitute a form of personal corruption on the part of the governor			1
" a @entity2 governor is not @entity95 traveling his realm with a portable mint and an imperial treasure in tow ; he no more has custody or possession of the @entity103 's general revenue funds than does any @entity2 , " they wrote			0
" no governor can say of his or her state what the @entity106 said of @entity108 : ' @entity109 , c'est moi			0
' " ( translation : " i am the state			0
" ) @entity1 : ' i do n't really understand the details ' of indictment charges @entity1 has assembled a team of legal powerhouses to defend him against the indictment			0
@entity119 attorney @entity118 , @entity78 attorney @entity120 , criminal lawyer @entity121 , former @entity124 presidential campaign legal counsel @entity122 and @entity126 campaign veteran @entity125 are among those currently working for the @entity2 governor			0
numerous political analysts have speculated that the indictment could actually work to @entity1 's political advantage by portraying the conservative politician as a victim of overly aggressive prosecutors working out of @entity134 -- a @entity136 stronghold in the largely @entity78 state .			1
