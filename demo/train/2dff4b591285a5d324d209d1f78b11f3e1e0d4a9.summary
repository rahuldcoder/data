@entity1 , @entity0 -- pope @entity4 will visit @entity0 and @entity5 from september 16 - 19 , @entity3 announced			1
it will be the first state visit to the @entity8 by a pontiff , the @entity6 said , noting that @entity11 's 1982 trip was officially a pastoral visit , while @entity4 's is a " papal visit			1
" the official announcement comes as the @entity15 reels from accusations that it did not do enough to stop child abuse by priests , nuns and other @entity21 authority figures across @entity22 for decades			1
@entity4 is working on an official statement , or pastoral letter , to @entity25 in @entity26 , where a damning government - backed report into child abuse by priests prompted four bishops to resign last year			1
there have also been widespread accusations against priests in @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35			2
the queen will receive the pope at the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity5 , during his september visit , the @entity6 said			1
@entity4 will give " a major speech to @entity8 civil society " at @entity47 in @entity1 and will beatify the 19th - century theologian and educationalist cardinal @entity42 at a public @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity0			1
beatification is one step shy of sainthood			0
the pope 's visit comes at a time of heightened tensions between @entity55 and the @entity56 following the @entity15 's outreach to disaffected @entity58 last year			1
the head of the @entity56 , archbishop of canterbury @entity60 , said the visit would be an opportunity to " cement ties " between the @entity25 and other @entity66 churches in the @entity8			2
" i look forward particularly to welcoming @entity4 to @entity70 on behalf of the @entity56 , " @entity60 said in a statement , referring to the archbishop 's official @entity1 residence			2
@entity60 met @entity4 in @entity55 in november , not long after the @entity15 said it had worked out a way for dissatisfied @entity58 to switch allegiance en masse to @entity55			1
some observers said the move will shatter more than 40 years of efforts to reconcile the @entity21 and @entity56 churches			0
the process will enable groups of @entity58 to become @entity21 and recognize the pope as their leader , yet have parishes that retain @entity56 rites , @entity78 officials said			2
the move comes some 450 years after @entity86 broke from @entity55 and created the @entity56 , forerunner of the @entity87			0
@entity60 was said to have been surprised by the move , which critics described as an end run around a long - established @entity21 - @entity56 dialogue			0
catholic and @entity56 theology and rites are broadly similar , but @entity58 have long allowed priests to marry and have children			0
in recent decades , the @entity87 has allowed women to become priests			0
the @entity97 -- the @entity98 branch of the @entity87 -- has ordained openly gay bishops			0
those developments have caused controversy within the communion , with more conservative parishes setting up alternative structures of authority			0
there are about 77 million @entity58 worldwide and about 1.1 billion @entity25 .			0
