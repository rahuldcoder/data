" " i want everyone treated fairly in this country			2
we have never gone wrong when we 've extended rights and responsibilities to everybody , " he said , drawing big applause			2
" that does n't weaken families , that strengthens families			2
" @entity1 highlighted some of his administration 's work in recent years , including the passage of health care reform and the end of combat in @entity27			1
he also outlined goals he hopes to accomplish under a second term , including the repeal of the @entity31 , which the administration has already stopped defending			2
while he did not mention @entity34 rival @entity34 by name , he drew a sharp line of contrast between his own ideology and that of @entity40 , promoting a theme of " togetherness			1
" " it 's been said this election is going to be about values			2
it 's about the economic values we have , about the values i believe will make @entity50 so special : everybody gets a fair shot , everybody gets a fair share , everybody plays by the same set of rules , " he said			2
the event , held at the @entity59 in @entity60 , was hosted by singer @entity61 and was sponsored in part by the @entity63 , an initiative by some @entity66 leaders to support @entity1 's re-election bid			1
" we admire his courage , like the courage he showed last week in affirming his belief in marriage equality , " @entity61 , who announced two years ago that he is gay , said on stage , prior to introducing @entity1			1
" that is the kind of courage we expect from our president and that is why we support him			0
" @entity81 legislature debates civil unions actress @entity83 was also seen in the crowd , according to pool news reports			0
roughly 200 people were expected to attend the event , with tickets starting at $ 5,000			0
@entity1 's speech came hours after he delivered a commencement speech at @entity91 , underscoring his address to the all - female school with political undertones			1
" after decades of slow , steady , extraordinary progress , you are now poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny but the destiny of this nation and of this world , " @entity1 said at the event in @entity6			1
the president took the opportunity to highlight the @entity107 , a fair - pay law passed under his first term in office , and slipped in themes from his re-election campaign , including his new motto " forward			0
" " we look forward , not back			0
and now that new doors have been opened for you , you 've got an obligation to seize those opportunities , " he said			0
recent polls show @entity1 with a significant lead among women against @entity40 rival @entity34			1
@entity40 attribute the margin to what 's become a @entity125 - backed campaign to paint the @entity40 as leading a " war on women			2
" while the president did not touch on his recent same - sex marriage endorsement in his @entity91 speech , he nevertheless encouraged graduates to " speak up for what 's right			1
" " the question is whether together we can muster the will -- in our own lives , in our common institutions , in our politics -- to bring about the changes we need , " he said			0

" also while in @entity6 , @entity1 taped an appearance on the tv program " @entity146 , " where he discussed his recent same - sex marriage endorsement			1
the segment will air tuesday			0
some @entity150 officials have said that @entity1 initially intended to reveal his opinion on same - sex marriage during his appearance on " @entity146 " this week , but vice president @entity155 's comments on a talk show last sunday supporting same - sex marriage pushed the president to make an announcement sooner			1
@entity1 's commencement speech came just two days after @entity40 rival @entity34 gave a commencement address at the evangelical @entity162 in @entity163 , where he made social issues a main theme of his remarks and touched on the marriage storyline			1
as fundamental as these principles are , they may become topics of democratic debate , " @entity34 said			1
" so it is today with the enduring institution of marriage			0
marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman			0

proceeds from both the dinner and the earlier fundraiser will go to the @entity1 @entity195 , a joint fundraising committee for the president 's re-election campaign , the @entity197 and several state @entity125 parties			1
while the full political implications of the president 's same - sex marriage verdict remain to be seen , @entity201 released a poll friday showing 51 % of @entity50 approve of @entity1 's support for gay couples to marry , while 45 % disapprove			1
the survey was conducted entirely after he announced his endorsement in an @entity211 interview on wednesday			0
and a new @entity201 poll out monday gave further details into @entity50 attitudes on the topic			0
while 50 % approve of same - sex marriage , a further breakdown of the numbers shows a significant gender gap : fifty - six percent of women say couples of the same gender should be legally allowed to marry , while 42 % of men feel the same way			0
the issue became prime political fodder over the weekend , with several high - profile @entity40 pouncing on the president 's remarks			2
sen. @entity230 of @entity231 , son of @entity40 presidential candidate @entity232 , said he " was n't sure that ( @entity1 's ) views on marriage could get any gayer , " sparking laughs on friday among his audience at an event held by @entity240 's @entity239			1
meanwhile , @entity242 chairman @entity241 also made headlines when he said sunday that same - sex marriage was not a " matter of civil rights			0
" " i think it 's just a matter of whether or not we 're going to adhere to something that 's been historical and religious and legal in this country for many , many years , " @entity241 said on @entity248 's " @entity247			2
" " i mean , marriage has to have a definition , and we just happen to believe it 's between a man and woman			2
" on monday , @entity34 took the day off from the trail , but his campaign is still playing defense after @entity1 's campaign released a biting new ad attacking the former @entity266 governor over his time at the private equity firm @entity268			1
the two - minute television spot -- to be released in major battleground states -- features former steelworkers talking about their job losses after @entity268 took over their company , @entity273			0
another steelworker in the ad compares @entity268 to a " vampire			0
" " they came in and sucked the life out of us , " he said			0
" it was like watching an old friend bleed to death			0
" the commercial re-establishes a major campaign hurdle @entity34 faced in the primary , when two of his former @entity40 rivals -- @entity287 and @entity288 -- accused @entity34 of being out of touch due to his lucrative tenure at @entity268 , which he helped found in 1984			1
@entity34 's campaign spokesman @entity291 responded to the ad monday saying the campaign would " welcome the @entity1 campaign 's attempt to pivot back to jobs and a discussion of their failed record			1
@entity34 helped create more jobs in his private sector experience and more jobs as @entity302 than president @entity1 has for the entire nation			1
" @entity0 's @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			2
