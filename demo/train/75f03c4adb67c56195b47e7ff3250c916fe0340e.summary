-- @entity2 's festering southern insurgency has come a long way since the early 2000s when ousted premier @entity4 dismissed the insurgents as mere " sparrow bandits			1
" initially unwilling to take seriously what could emerge as a threat to @entity2 national integrity , @entity7 has over the past decade attempted to paint its restive southern @entity12 states as suffering from little more than a small - scale insurgency led by shadowy groups with nebulous demands			1
in the light of the last week 's brazen attack in southern @entity2 in which 16 militants were killed in an hour - long firefight at a naval base , analysts say that argument is looking increasingly threadbare			1
well - armed , motivated and increasingly audacious , the @entity12 insurgency in the southern provinces of @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 has emerged with a clear goal : the creation of a separate @entity12 state for the region 's 1.8 million @entity12 ethnic malays			1
the insurgency has so far claimed more than 5,300 lives and left more than 9,000 injured in nine years of escalating attacks that have included drive - by shootings , bomb blasts and beheadings , according to @entity41 , an non-government that monitors the conflict in the southern provinces			1
" we are seeing a greater radicalization of the insurgency , " said @entity45 , a senior researcher on @entity2 at @entity46 ( @entity46 )			1
" they do n't want the presence of anyone in the region apart from ethnic @entity33 and this they 've made clear with public announcements			0
" the @entity56 ( @entity25 ) come under the umbrella of the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) -- a group that combines ethnic @entity61 nationalism and @entity63 ideologies in equal measure			0
their aim is to create an independent state called @entity67 ( @entity68 of @entity25 ) using violence and terror to oppose what they claim is a @entity2 @entity74 occupation			1
the @entity2 government has sent more than 150,000 soldiers to the region to protect it from an estimated 3,000 to 9,000 rebel ( or juwae as they are called locally ) fighters , according to estimates from human rights groups			1
while government statistics put @entity2 @entity84 at just 6 % of the region 's population , @entity82 complain they dominate the region			1
education , in particular , has been one of the fault lines in the conflict , with hard line @entity82 viewing the school system as a tool of @entity2 colonialism			2
@entity46 say 157 teachers have been killed since 2004			2
the southern provinces were once part of an independent @entity12 sultanate until they were annexed by @entity2 -- then called @entity2 -- in 1909			1
while calls for secession have simmered since then , an insurgent raid to steal weapons from an army camp in january , 2004 , led to a crackdown by the @entity2 military , which sparked the modern insurgency			1
later that year , the @entity2 military opened fire on protesters at @entity110 in @entity25 , killing seven people			1
almost 1,300 protesters were detained at the scene , stripped and some of them tortured , while others were transported to @entity115 in the province -- a journey of five hours			0
detainees were stacked into military vans so tightly that 78 people died of suffocation en route			2
the government has since tried to reverse its heavy handed policy in the region , using instead a heart - and - minds campaign to pacify the provinces			0
according to lt. general @entity129 of the @entity130 , the operation has been a success			0
" if we compare it to nine years ago , the situation was very bad , " he told @entity0			0
" every time officers tried to round up or search suspect targets , we received strong resistance from locals			0
" now we have prevented many attacks thanks to information given out by local residents - a good example is the latest military base attack ; insurgents lost a lot of lives			0
" despite this , non-government agencies say there is unlikely to be peace in the region in the near - term			0
according to @entity45 , the 2004 @entity110 incident marked a turning point in the insurgency , radicalizing a younger generation			2
" the commander in this latest attack was a survivor of the @entity110 incident , " @entity45 said , referring to the failed attack on a @entity2 military camp in @entity27 on february 13 that left insurgent commander @entity161 and 15 other militants dead			1
" what we are seeing is a transfer of power within the insurgency from an older generation , which favors negotiation , to a younger radicalized generation who see negotiation as an act of betrayal to the ideology of separatism , " he said			0
" there is now a split in the leadership			0
" the @entity110 incident , viewed by many as a strategic blunder on the part of the @entity2 military , has been instrumental in turning " unarmed sympathizers into brutal insurgents , " @entity45 said			2
" this man ( @entity191 ) survived torture at @entity110 and many of the new generation of commanders also survived @entity110			0
" certainly if leaflets found in @entity27 's @entity199 district on february 14 , the day following last week 's attack , are anything to go by , the insurgency is showing no signs of easing			2
" we will retaliate in every way for our losses			0
... from now on , we will attack and kill @entity74 @entity2 teachers and @entity74 @entity2 people			1
we will attack @entity74 @entity2 community ... one @entity12 life must be repaid with 10 @entity74 @entity2 lives , " reads the leaflets according to @entity46			1
one of the features of the campaign , which has had a marked escalation since last march , is that insurgents have shown little regard for @entity82 that they see as collaborating with @entity2 authorities			2
everyone from imams to @entity12 rubber farmers has been targeted by death squads and bombs detonated in @entity2 ethnic areas have indiscriminately claimed @entity12 lives			1
" the new radical leadership has no problems with collateral victims in its campaign			0
their attitude is that @entity82 should not be living next to ethnic @entity233 anyway , " @entity45 said			0
@entity235 's latest report on the armed conflict called on insurgents to halt the campaign of targeting civilians			0
" the insurgents seem to be attacking many of the very people on whose behalf they are ostensibly fighting , destroying their lives and livelihoods , " said @entity240 , @entity235 's @entity241 deputy director , at the 2011 release of the report			2
" whatever their grievances , they do not justify this serious and systematic violation of international law			0
" @entity46 said that while insurgents use human rights abuses by the @entity2 military as an excuse for its reprisals , @entity7 -- where the government has a long tradition of drawing its legitimacy through the army -- needed the political courage to hold the military accountable			1
" if this had happened , it may have slowed down radicalization , " @entity45 said .			0

@entity2 's southern insurgency has dragged on for almost a decade
about 5,300 people have been killed and more than 9,000 injured
