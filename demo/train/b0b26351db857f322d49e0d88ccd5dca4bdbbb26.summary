@entity0 -- waging war against historic flooding in eight @entity6 and @entity7 states , the @entity2 opened a spillway north of @entity0 on monday in an effort to calm the rising @entity10			1
a crowd gathered near the entrance to the @entity8 to watch workers use cranes to slide open the gates to the flood control system			2
the spillway , like another that could be opened next week , is designed to divert floodwater away from @entity0 and slow the raging river to protect the low - lying city			1
@entity8 is part of a system built after the devastating @entity10 flood of 1927			2
while the river 's highest levels may still be days away , a decision to open the second flood control structure -- the @entity29 -- may not be , @entity26 gov. @entity25 said			1
people with property that would flood if the spillway is opened should not dally , @entity25 warned : " my advice to our people is not to wait , to get prepared now			1
" the @entity8 diverts water from the @entity10 to the @entity39 by way of @entity41			0
but opening the @entity29 would flood populated areas and could put @entity43 , @entity26 , and other communities at risk			2
col. @entity46 , the @entity2 ' district commander in @entity0 , said he has requested the authority to open the @entity29			1
@entity25 said the @entity49 had asked for at least three days , but preferably five days , to evacuate those areas before the @entity2 opens the gates			1
upstream in @entity53 , residents and authorities had prepared all they could monday as they waited for the @entity10 to crest at a near - record 14 feet above flood stage tuesday morning			1
" it 's sort of torturous , " @entity58 mayor @entity57 said			1
" we 've been waiting so long			0
it 's hard keeping people 's attention			2
it 's warning fatigue , if you will			2
but we 're ready for it			0
" the river level stood at 47.8 feet monday evening and is expected to crest at 48 feet , said @entity69 , a forecaster for the @entity70 in @entity58			1
president @entity71 signed a disaster declaration for the state of @entity74 monday , which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms , flooding and tornadoes since early april			2
the @entity10 is the highest it 's been at @entity53 since 1937 , when it crested at 48.7 feet -- 14.7 feet above flood stage			1
that flood killed 500 people and inundated 20 million acres of land , said col. @entity86 , the @entity87 commander			2
the river covered the lowest parts of the city 's historic @entity90 and had forced about 400 people from their homes monday , @entity57 said			1
another 1,300 remained in low - lying areas , he said			2
corps officials said levees protecting the area appeared to be holding up well , with only minor amounts of water seeping in from beneath or lapping over from above			1
" all of our levees were designed to withstand heights greater than what we 're seeing today , although this height is significant , " @entity100 , chief of geotechnical engineering in the @entity58 district with the @entity2 , told @entity1 affiliate @entity103			1
" the levees have held up very well in this event			2
" but local officials were taking no chances			0
" it 's a very powerful river			1
it looks like it 's running very slowly , but it has a very strong current , " said @entity115 , director of preparedness in @entity117 , @entity74 , which includes @entity53			0
" we still do n't know ( exactly what ) the river might do			0
" @entity125 , an @entity58 resident who lives near the @entity126 , said he 's seen extensive flooding and homes left uninhabitable by the water as he 's traveled through the region			1
" it 's affecting daily life tremendously , " said @entity125 , a @entity117 elections ' division employee who submitted photos of the flooding to @entity134			1
" it is pretty severe downtown			0
... i know a lot of ... people have lost their homes			0
" @entity57 said the flooding had not yet caused major disruptions in the city , and he did not expect it to , even though @entity70 meteorologist @entity147 said it is possible the river wo n't fall below flood stage at @entity53 until june			1
that 's the problem in @entity152 and southern @entity153 , where flooding continues even though the @entity10 and @entity156 river crests have moved south			1
in @entity159 , @entity153 , @entity1 ireporter @entity157 said a swollen creek is inundating a church and bandshell while threatening to wash out telephone poles			0
" we can not get to the park , which is underwater , or to other towns , " he said			0
" most of the roads are closed , plus the water sewage plant is getting sandbagged			0
" if a nearby sewer plant is forced to shut down , " we wo n't have tap water to bathe in or drink , " he added			0
last week , the @entity2 intentionally breached a levee in @entity152 as part of its effort to reduce the pressure on other levees , flooding 130,000 acres of agricultural land over the objection of state officials and some farmers			1
" i 'm very sad			0
i look at that and i do n't have a home , " @entity181 said , pointing to her flooded family farm			0
" i feel like we 're having to suffer for somebody else			0
" as the floodwaters worked their way south , the operator of a nuclear power plant in @entity189 , @entity10 , expressed concerns that rising water could cut off an access road to the facility			0
however , there was no plan to shut down the @entity200 and no immediate cause for concern , a spokesman for the @entity197 said monday			0
@entity10 gov. @entity203 told @entity1 's @entity204 the greatest risk will likely be from flooding around the powerful river 's tributaries , rather the @entity10 itself			1
" pray for the best , but prepare for the worst , " he said			0
in @entity26 , where the river 's crest is not expected to begin arriving until next week , @entity25 added bears to the list of things residents need to think about			1
he said flooding could force some of the state 's ursine residents from their homes and into populated areas			2
so far , 21 parishes have issued emergency declarations ahead of expected flooding , @entity25 said			2
he said 400 @entity225 troops would be active by the end of the day monday helping prepare for the flood			0
even with a forecast for record or near - record crests into next week and weeks of high water to follow , corps officials say they expect nothing like the widespread and devastating flooding that occurred along the southernmost stretch of the @entity10 in 1927			1
that flood began near @entity58 in the fall of 1926 and did not end until the following august , according to the @entity70			1
it devastated the levee system , and flooded 165 million acres of land , sweeping 600,000 people from their homes			0
it came at a cost of 246 lives and the equivalent of nearly $ 624 million in 2011 dollars			0
as a result of that flood , the report says , @entity245 passed the @entity249 , which led to a massive public works programs to build a system of levees and other structures designed to hold back the river more effectively			1
the latest flooding in the @entity10 and @entity156 river valleys is largely the byproduct of torrential rains throughout the region			2
over one two - week stretch , there was about 600 % more precipitation than usual , @entity86 said			0
the weather now appears to be working in the flood fighters ' favor			0
only minimal rain is expected over the coming days , with daytime temperatures forecast to be in the upper 80s and 90s through thursday , at which point the water levels should begin to creep back down			2
still , a spokesman for the @entity270 told @entity272 's @entity271 that people around the river and its tributaries need to be careful and should not wait until they see water to take action			1
" it 's going to be a tragedy on many levels			1
so many people are going to be displaced			0
they 're going to be displaced for a long time and they may not have much of anything to come back to , " said @entity282			0
@entity1 's @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 and @entity289 contributed to this report .			0

@entity292 : " it 's going to be a tragedy on many levels , " says @entity296 spokesman
@entity2 opens a spillway to protect @entity0
there 's been flooding around @entity58 , though levees appear sound , officials say
the river near @entity58 is expected to crest at a near - record 14 feet above flood stage
