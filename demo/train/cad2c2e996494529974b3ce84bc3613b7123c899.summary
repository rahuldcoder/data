-- in a stunning achievement for unionists and @entity6 , critics of the @entity3 governor @entity2 marshaled over a million signatures for a petition that has made it possible for @entity2 to lose his office in a recall election this spring			1
if so , that would be the first successful gubernatorial recall in @entity3 history and only the third in that of the @entity16			1
@entity2 blundered last year by pushing through the state legislature a hugely unpopular law that cripples public - sector collective bargaining and thereby suffocates most government unions			2
coming on the heels of the november referendum in @entity24 , which overturned a similar @entity26 - sponsored law , it 's clear that the @entity16 trade union movement is not yet dead			1
indeed , the defense of these venerable institutions retains the capacity to put thousands in the streets and mobilize millions of voters , not all of whom are card - carrying unionists by any means			0
but those hostile to unionism are hardly backing off			0
in @entity40 , where @entity26 control the legislature and governor 's mansion , they are about to pass a state " right - to - work " law similar to those anti-union statutes long ago enacted in deep red states as @entity48 and @entity49			0
and in the nation 's capital , @entity26 legislators are on the warpath against the very existence of the @entity55 , the 75 - year - old agency whose depression - era mandate fosters the capacity of workers to form " unions of their own choosing			2
" why the fuss , when private sector trade unions enroll but one out of every 14 workers and public sector unions have hardly grown in more than 30 years ? meanwhile the strike has practically vanished from the @entity16 landscape - there were at least ten times more each year in the 1970s - and the negotiation of a new union contract , in both the public and private sectors , is considered a labor victory if the workers escape without too many givebacks			1
political rhetoric during this campaign season fails to capture what 's at stake			0
the @entity26 denounce the pensions long ago negotiated by public sector unions as too expensive and they keep up attacks on the contributions of " @entity84 union bosses " to the @entity6			2
for their part , most @entity6 , and this includes president @entity87 , rarely offer a full - throated defense of the labor movement itself			0
instead they frame the @entity26 anti-union offensive in the @entity92 states largely as an assault on the middle class , as if questions of power and ideology were not at stake			2
but the fate of unionism is all about class power in @entity16 society and the ideologies that motivate those who either defend or defame these institutions			1
the @entity107 protests have moved issues of economic inequality closer to the top of the contemporary political agenda , but it 's the unions -- in their sometimes plodding and prosaic fashion -- that have long ameliorated the stark disparities of wealth and income that an unfettered capitalism so naturally produces			2
tax fairness is a big political issue this campaign season , but of far greater impact on the distribution of @entity16 wealth and power is the existence of a union movement and the prospect that it might one day grow again			1
in the middle decades of the 20th century , when incomes were less unequal -- economists called this the era of the " great compression " -- the trade unions were potent , both at the bargaining table and in politics			0
conversely , there is much evidence to show that the sharp decline in private sector unionism since the late 1970s is connected to the rising inequality we have today			0
when they are strong , unions can limit the prerogatives of individual businessmen , government officials and the untamed workings of the labor market			0
contemporary free - market conservatives find all this intolerable , which is why governors like @entity2 and @entity154 's @entity153 so often seek to demonize the trade unions as corrupt and omnipotent			1
fortunately , that rhetoric has found its limit , first in @entity24 and now in @entity3 where more than a million citizens put down their names endorsing the union idea			1
