-- reigning @entity2 champions @entity1 began the new season as they ended the last , at the top of the table			1
but @entity1 were made to work hard for their 2 - 0 victory against a lively @entity8 side			1
the match began with floral tributes for two @entity8 fans who died when flight @entity12 crashed in eastern @entity14 last month killing all 298 on board			1
@entity16 and @entity17 were traveling to @entity18 to watch their team play in a preseason tournament before tragedy struck			0
on 17 minutes the stadium broke out into a minute 's applause in their honor			0
classy control on the pitch @entity8 more than matched @entity1 , creating almost as many chances			1
crucially , they could n't get a single shot on target and with half time approaching , @entity31 international @entity30 superbly controlled a long ball over the top of the defense before back - heeling it into the path of @entity39 who slotted home			1
" i think we deserved it , " @entity41 told @entity42 after the game			0
" we played aggressive and they did n't have any chances			0
" a late second that was n't strictly true			0
@entity8 pressed in the second half and with a little more composure could have snatched an equalizer			1
instead , substitute @entity52 fired the ball home at the second attempt in injury time to add some gloss to the scoreline			1
" it was frustrating for us because in the second half we pushed on , brought some younger players on who were a little naive but threatened with their pace , " @entity8 coach @entity59 told @entity42			1
" we looked like we might win it , " he added			0
@entity67 win earlier in the day , @entity67 began life without @entity69 with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity71			1
@entity69 had been in phenomenal form since his arrival at @entity74 in 2011 , scoring 69 goals in 110 games			2
last season had been his best yet , driving @entity67 to a second place finish and narrowly missing out on the club 's first @entity2 title			2
yet his time had always been filled with controversy			0
he arrived after serving a suspension for biting a player whilst playing in the @entity86 league , and was suspended again for biting @entity88 defender @entity87			0
he was also banned for allegedly racially abusing then - @entity90 defender @entity89			2
however , after being sanctioned for biting a player at this summer 's @entity93 finals -- a four month ban from all football related activities -- @entity67 sold him to @entity97			2
a solid start it was a solid , if unspectacular , start for life without @entity69			0
@entity101 , one of the players to shine most alongside the @entity104 last season , opened the scoring with a superb side foot finish from a wonderful @entity107 through ball			2
@entity71 equalized with aplomb , @entity110 smashing home into the top right hand corner , and had much the better of the second half			1
yet it was the diminutive @entity101 who somehow won a header in @entity71 's penalty box which was guided home by fellow @entity118 international @entity117			1
" he sent us a lovely text this morning wishing us all the best , which was a great gesture			0
he is a friend now of @entity67 , " coach @entity122 said of @entity69 after the game , according to the @entity124			2
" i texted him back			0
it 's a real love in ! he 's a great boy but he is gone now ... today was about winning and we got there			0
