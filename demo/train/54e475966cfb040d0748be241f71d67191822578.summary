-- it 's simple , president @entity1 said			1
rape is a crime , and politicians -- especially male politicians -- should n't be " making decisions about women 's health care			1
" appearing wednesday on @entity9 's " tonight " show , @entity1 responded to questions by host @entity11 about a comment about rape by @entity16 's @entity15 candidate for @entity17 , @entity18			1
pregnancies occurring after a rape , @entity18 said , were intended by @entity21			1
" i do n't know how these guys come up with these ideas , " @entity1 told @entity11			2
" let me make a very simple proposition : rape is rape			0
and so these various distinctions about rape do n't make too much sense to me -- do n't make any sense to me			0
" @entity18 has apologized for offending anyone			2
but his words have fueled the national fight to gain women voters in a very close presidential election			1
related : women voters by the numbers during his chat with @entity11 , @entity1 used the @entity18 controversy to say that the next president likely would appoint a new @entity42 justice who could potentially change federal abortion laws			1
@entity1 on @entity18 : male politicians should n't make abortion decisions @entity1 's @entity15 presidential rival , @entity47 , has said he would appoint justices who would support overturning @entity50 , the 1973 court decision affirming a woman 's right to have an abortion			1
" @entity50 is probably hanging in the balance , " @entity1 said			2
" women are capable of making these decisions in consultation with their partners , with their doctors , " said the president			2
" and for politicians to want to intrude in this stuff often times without any information is a huge problem			0
" the @entity1 campaign released a new television ad reinforcing those points , highlighting @entity47 comments on @entity50 and his plan to try and cut funding for @entity70			1
related : when ' @entity72 , ' rape and pregnancy collide @entity15 distancing reaction within @entity18 's own party has been deafening			1
@entity47 had endorsed him in a tv ad before the controversy			2
afterward , @entity47 said through a campaign spokeswoman that he did not agree with @entity18 's comments , but the ad would continue to run			1
other powerful @entity15 distancing themselves from @entity18 include 2008 @entity15 presidential nominee sen. @entity83 and @entity85 sen. @entity84 , a top @entity15 @entity17 fundraiser			1
sen. @entity87 , @entity88 , canceled plans to campaign with @entity18 on wednesday			2
and in a sharp rebuke , a fellow @entity15 running for @entity16 's governor seat , former rep. @entity92 , issued a statement saying , " i strongly disagree with the statement made by @entity18 during last night 's @entity17 debate			2
i urge him to apologize			0
" after apology , @entity83 does support @entity18 , spokesman clarifies @entity18 said wednesday he 's sorry for any offense , but @entity102 have twisted his comments for " political gain			1
" the whole controversy , he said , exemplifies " what 's wrong with @entity107 these days			0
" " i spoke from my heart ; i spoke with my principle ; i spoke from my faith , " @entity18 said			2
a senior @entity15 strategist said @entity18 may not face as much push - back from @entity15 leaders for two reasons : republicans very much want to hold on to that @entity17 seat			2
that -- with less than two weeks remaining before @entity118			0
what @entity18 said here are @entity18 's comments saying he supports banning abortions in cases of rape , word - for - word : " i struggled with it myself for a long time , but i came to realize life is a gift from @entity21 , and i think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape , that it is something that @entity21 intended to happen , " said @entity18 , who now serves as @entity16 's state treasurer			1
he also said he would allow for exceptions to an abortion ban when a mother 's life was in danger			0
@entity15 @entity17 candidate : pregnancies from rape @entity72 on wednesday , @entity18 tried to clarify his comments , saying , " i absolutely abhor violence			1
i absolutely abhor any kind of sexual violence			0
i abhor rape , and i am absolutely confident that , as i stand here , the @entity21 that i worship abhors violence , abhors sexual violence and abhors rape			1
the @entity21 that i worship would never , ever want to see evil done			2
" sounds familiar it 's not the first time rape and abortion have dominated the campaign			0
in august , rep. @entity152 of @entity153 , who 's also a @entity15 running for @entity17 , ignited a firestorm when he said " legitimate rape " rarely resulted in pregnancy			0
and last week , @entity15 rep. @entity158 , who 's running for re-election in @entity160 , questioned the necessity of allowing abortions if a mother 's life is at risk			0
he said such an exemption to an abortion ban was simply a political tool used by pro-choice activists			0
doctors strongly disputed rep. @entity172 contention that doctors rarely , if ever , perform abortions to save the life of the mother			0
@entity83 , @entity177 , told @entity0 on wednesday that his support for @entity18 was dependent on an apology			0
" it depends on what he does , " @entity83 said on " @entity181 360			0
" thursday , after hearing of @entity18 's apology , @entity83 said that he " is glad " @entity18 apologized and " hopes the people of @entity16 will elect mr. @entity18			0
" former @entity15 presidential candidate @entity185 offered words of support for @entity188 -- accusing opponents of " gotcha politics			0
" @entity18 's comments resulted in a misunderstanding , @entity185 told @entity0 's " @entity193 " " what the @entity17 candidate said is the child is a gift from @entity21 , whether it 's conceived from rape or not , it 's still -- the gift of human life is a gift from @entity21 , " @entity185 explained			1
" he did n't say rape was a gift from @entity21			1
you 'd have to contort words beyond meaning to get that understanding of it			0
" @entity185 : mourdock criticism ' gotcha politics ' it was " gotcha politics , " @entity185 said , because @entity18 was " talking about the baby in the womb as something that is precious , " even though it was conceived through " horrible circumstances			0
" the whole thing is " outrageous " and " demeaning to women , " said @entity220 chairwoman @entity219 in a statement			0
party leaders called on @entity47 to stop airing his tv ad endorsing @entity18			1
" as @entity18 's most prominent booster and star of @entity18 's current campaign ads , @entity47 should denounce these comments more strongly than he has , " @entity220 spokesman @entity224 said			1
" he should go further and demand that the ad featuring him speaking directly to the camera on @entity18 's behalf be taken off the air , and @entity47 should withdraw his endorsement of @entity18 immediately			1
" @entity0 's @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
