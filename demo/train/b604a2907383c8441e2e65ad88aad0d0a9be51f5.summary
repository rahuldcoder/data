@entity0 -- the morning after @entity3 's military came clean and admitted their operation to restore order was in fact a coup , the capital appeared normal with shops open and commuters heading for work -- though schools were shuttered			1
surprisingly , there was not much of a military presence on the streets , with the exception of the heavily - armed troops stationed outside key buildings in the city , including the @entity21 and the @entity22			1
we spotted only four soldiers in their camouflaged fatigues during our journey around @entity0 -- though more were undoubtedly deployed overnight following the imposition of a curfew between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. every now and then vehicles with darkened windows arrived at the @entity22 , where the coup was declared , to deliver those people summoned by the military administration			1
anyone who did n't accept this invitation faced an arrest warrant			0
military officials have n't provided much explanation about the reasons for the summonses , saying only that it 's necessary " to ensure smooth operation of restoration of peace and order			2
" there were rumors that tv stations were slowly returning to air after being switched off by the military , though foreign news stations such as @entity1 and the @entity51 remain blacked out			2
meanwhile , protest sites belonging to both " red shirt " supporters of ousted former prime minister @entity54 , and the " yellow shirt " protesters associated with @entity0 's urban elite and middle class have emptied -- the detritus from their long struggle all that 's left			1
these cities within a city have stood for months			0
the yellow shirts ' former camp by the @entity66 is now a mountain of rubbish and abandoned tents awaiting removal by the army of municipal workers with their trucks and cranes			2
many of the refuse workers seemed cheerful as they started the massive cleanup operation , seemingly oblivious to the seismic political shift going on around them			0
it certainly does n't feel like a coup as you would imagine it			0
but after months of protests -- and periodic outbreaks of violence -- many ordinary @entity83 seem content to let this play out for the time being , with many of the opinion that anything that avoids further chaos and might help to resolve the political conflict is a good thing .			0

not much of a military presence on the streets of @entity3 's capital
soldiers only in *evidence* around key military buildings such as @entity21
