-- for now , @entity1 is a lucky man			1
but , like life itself , that may not last			1
convicted by an @entity7 court of possessing a kilogram of crystal meth , the 37 - year - old man was sentenced to death by hanging at @entity11 in northeastern @entity7 , according to @entity12 , an official newspaper that offered this wince - inducing account : on the morning of october 9 , @entity1 was taken from his cell to the gallows , where the judge who had issued the order read his sentence aloud and official papers were signed			1
then , a rope was placed around his neck and he was hanged for 12 minutes , after which his body was lowered and a doctor declared he was dead			1
the doctor , the judge and the prison head then signed the death certificate , and the body of @entity1 was taken to a morgue for delivery the following day to his relatives			1
but the next day , a worker at the morgue noticed that plastic encasing one of the bodies had steam in front of the mouth			1
the worker told the doctors at the morgue , who took @entity1 to @entity43 hospital in the town of @entity11 , where he was reported to be feeling better			1
@entity1 's family told the newspaper they had been preparing to pick up the body when they heard that he was still alive , that his daughters had rejoiced and that they were hoping for a reprieve			1
but the judge who issued the sentence , @entity53 , was unmoved			1
" the sentence is approved and the sentence is death , so we will follow through with the execution order again , " he said			2
a legal expert cited in the article said a law that mandates the death sentence for anyone possessing more than 30 grams of any illegal drug was passed three years ago			2
in a statement issued wednesday , @entity62 called for a reprieve			2
" the horrific prospect of this man facing a second hanging , after having gone through the whole ordeal already once , merely underlines the cruelty and inhumanity of the death penalty , " said @entity65 , director of @entity62 's @entity66 and @entity67			2
" the @entity7 authorities must immediately halt @entity77 's execution and issue a moratorium on all others			2
" this year , @entity7 is thought to have executed at least 508 people , most of them convicted of drug offenses , the group said			2
" carrying out a second execution on a man who somehow managed to survive 12 minutes of hanging -- who was certified as dead and whose body was about to be turned over to his family -- is simply ghastly			1
it betrays a basic lack of humanity that sadly underpins much of @entity7 's justice system , " said @entity65			0
the organization @entity94 opposes execution as an inherently cruel and unusual form of punishment that violates fundamental human rights , said @entity99 , a researcher in the organization 's @entity66 and @entity101			0
he said the group is particularly opposed to execution of alleged drug offenders because cases like @entity77 's are tried in revolutionary courts , which tend to include violations of due process , in addition , the group considers hangings to constitute torture , he said			0
@entity7 's interpretation of @entity115 law allows for individuals to be spared from a second execution attempt in certain circumstances , like stoning in cases of adultery that fails to result in death			0
human rights groups estimate that the @entity7 authorities currently hold at least 10 women and men who face possible execution by stoning on adultery charges			0
at least 70 people have been executed by stoning in @entity7 since 1980			0
the last known execution by stoning was in 2009 , @entity99 said			0
but @entity7 judiciary officials say there is apparently nothing in law that would prevent @entity1 from being executed again			1
others have a different interpretation			0
according to the semi-official @entity7 @entity137 , ayatollah @entity136 said saturday -- a high - ranking cleric who was being pressed on his position -- said , " if a person is executed for drug smuggling and returns to life , his second execution is not allowed			0
" according to the @entity146 's @entity145 , a massive increase in seizures of high - purity crystalline methamphetamine from @entity7 began in 2008			0
that same year , for the first time , the country seized four clandestine meth labs			0
@entity0 's @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			0

hanged for 12 minutes , @entity1 is declared dead
official papers are signed , and the body goes to a morgue
but steamed plastic reveals that he is alive
the judge is unmoved
