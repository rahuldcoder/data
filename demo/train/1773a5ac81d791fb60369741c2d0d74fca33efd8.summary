@entity0 -- when all - american @entity3 first stepped on stage to audition , nobody could have anticipated how this 23 - year - old from @entity6 would take the @entity7 by storm			1
now , she may very well win " @entity9 , " one of the biggest televised talent contests in the region			1
during her debut appearance , she looked so out of place that many thought she 'd flop altogether			2
" it was nerve - wracking , " @entity3 said , " because i came on stage and i did n't understand			1
" the show 's judges were questioning her in @entity20 , and @entity21 had great difficulty following , making for some very awkward moments			1
but then she started strumming her oud , a traditional @entity20 musical instrument , and the mood began to shift			1
she belted out a classic @entity20 song			1
that 's when her life changed			0
the @entity31 novice had chosen to cover an @entity33 diva , legendary songstress @entity34 , so revered throughout the region that many @entity20 singers would be too intimidated to make such an attempt			1
" when i 'm performing , i 'm in a different element , " @entity3 said			1
" so at that point , i was n't scared			0
" to everyone 's surprise , her rendition of the classic " @entity41 ( @entity42 from you ) " was a huge hit			2
" when i finished , everyone was just shocked , " explained @entity3			1
" actually , when the judges were giving their comments after my performance , i did n't understand them , either			2
" she was n't the only one confused			0
fans of the show wondered how a young foreigner who barely spoke @entity20 could sing it so well			1
' her voice just spoke to me ' it was just three years ago when @entity21 , who 'd spent most of her life studying classical music and opera , first encountered another grand dame of @entity20 music			1
she was studying at @entity63 in @entity64 at the time			0
" i came across an article online about the famous @entity67 singer @entity66 , and i was just really mesmerized by her singing , " she remembers			0
" it was like nothing i had heard before			0
" once she discovered @entity34 , her attention turned eastward			0
" well , her music is the best , and her voice just spoke to me , " @entity3 said admiringly			1
" her music is just so deep , and it touches my soul			0
" she began studying @entity20 and learning how to play the oud			1
after college , she moved to @entity76 , where she learned local @entity78 music and began performing in @entity80 's @entity79			0
now , life is completely different			0
with her appearances on " @entity9 , " @entity21 's become very popular -- but she has n't only made fans			1
critics have slammed her , asking why an @entity31 should be allowed to compete on a reality show for @entity86			1
her performance of @entity89 singer @entity88 's " @entity91 ( @entity90 ) " got her through to the finals			1
famous @entity67 singer @entity93 , one of the show 's judges and a supporter of @entity21 's , faced criticism when she voted for the @entity31 over an @entity86 group of contestants			2
break with tradition some have even suggested @entity21 , the first @entity103 contestant to compete on the show , is n't even really @entity31 , latching on to her very distinct accent in an attempt to prove it			2
she laughs off such claims			0
" ever since i was younger , i 've had a different way of speaking , " she said			0
" i remember when i was a kid growing up in @entity111 , my parents had a @entity113 accent			0
i actually tried to pick up a @entity111 accent at one point because i thought it was cool			0
and then i came home , and my parents were like , ' why are you speaking like that ? ' " @entity3 says she 's taking it all in her stride			1
" i like my accent			0
i like the fact that it 's unique , and i think it 's narrow - minded to believe that just because you 're from a certain place , you have to speak a certain way			2
because people learn and people change and people travel , and things about them change all the time			0
why does that not include accents ? " @entity21 has become a sensation by singing the most unexpected of songs			2
it 's not just that she chose traditional songs , it 's also that she broke with tradition when doing so			2
at a time when more and more @entity7 musicians are borrowing @entity142 sounds and styles , this @entity31 decided to cross musical cultures and defy cultural expectations			1
" i 'm really happy because this music is so special for me , but it does n't really get much acknowledgment in the @entity149 , " she said			0
" and i feel like i 'm bringing a new audience and almost giving the music the justice it deserves			0
" the finals take place saturday night in @entity0 , broadcast live by the @entity156 network			0
the winner will be announced on the same night -- could it be the singer from @entity6 ?			2

@entity3 has won over many fans with her renditions of classic @entity20 songs
she is through to the finals of @entity7 *tv* reality show " @entity9 "
