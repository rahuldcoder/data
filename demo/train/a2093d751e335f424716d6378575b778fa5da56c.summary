@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 announced monday that @entity3 and four other 9/11 terror suspects will face a military trial at the @entity7 detention facility in @entity8			1
the decision is a sharp reversal for the @entity12 administration , which wanted the terror suspects to have federal civilian trials			1
besides @entity3 , the other suspects to face charges of participating in the 9/11 plot are @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
all five are at @entity7			1
in announcing his decision , @entity2 blasted @entity24 for imposing restrictions on the @entity27 's ability to bring the men to @entity29 for civilian trials -- a course of action he promised in 2009			1
" after thoroughly studying the case , it became clear to me that the best venue for prosecution was in federal court			0
i stand by that decision today , " @entity2 said			1
" as the president has said , those unwise and unwarranted restrictions ( imposed by @entity24 ) undermine our counterterrorism efforts and could harm our national security			0
decisions about who , where and how to prosecute have always been -- and must remain -- the responsibility of the executive branch			0
" @entity2 insisted , " we were prepared to bring a powerful case against @entity3 and his four co-conspirators -- one of the most well - researched and documented cases i have ever seen in my decades of experience as a prosecutor			1
" he added , " had this case proceeded in @entity58 or in an alternative venue in the @entity60 , as i seriously explored in the past year , i am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years			0
" @entity2 had promised to seek the death penalty for each of the five men			1
he warned monday that it is an " open question " if such a penalty can be imposed by a military commission if the defendants plead guilty			2
he expressed confidence in the military , however , to conduct " fair trials " and deliver " just verdicts			2
" president @entity12 's primary concern is that the accused perpetrators " be brought to justice as swiftly as possible , " @entity73 press secretary @entity72 told reporters			1
@entity2 's plan to hold a nonmilitary trial had been sharply criticized by both @entity81 leaders and key members of the @entity29 congressional delegation			1
among other things , critics cited cost and security concerns tied to a trial in @entity58			2
they also argued that the suspects -- who are not @entity60 citizens -- should not receive the rights and protections provided to defendants in civilian courts			1
rep. @entity95 , @entity96 , chairman of the @entity97 , said in a written statement that it is " unfortunate that it took the @entity12 administration more than two years to figure out what the majority of @entity60 already know : that 9/11 conspirator @entity3 is not a common criminal , he 's a war criminal			1
" rep. @entity106 , @entity96 - @entity29 , head of the @entity107 , called the decision a " long - awaited step in the right direction			2
" " these terror trials belong in a military commission at @entity7 , " he said			1
the decision is a " vindication of president ( @entity117 ) @entity117 's detention policies			2
" @entity29 mayor @entity118 said it 's " more appropriate " for the trials to be held in a " secure area			1
" " what i 've read about military tribunals is they 're not an automatic kind of thing , " he said			0
" they are a different form of a legal system , but something that this country can implement and not be ashamed of			0
" @entity2 said he respects the different views expressed in @entity24 and elsewhere , but insisted he is in a better position to make the final decision			1
" i know this case in a way that members of @entity24 do not , " he said			0
" do i know better than them ? yes			0
" a number of @entity140 and civil liberties activists have expressed dismay at the idea of holding military trials , warning that such a move represents a dangerous breakdown in the @entity60 judicial system			2
sen. @entity148 , @entity149 , the chairman of the @entity150 , said the decision was disappointing in light of the fact that the @entity60 justice system is " the envy of the world			2
" " federal courts have convicted hundreds of terrorists , " he noted			0
" when americans are murdered on @entity60 soil , we should not be afraid to bring those responsible for those heinous acts to justice in @entity60 courts			0
" @entity165 , an attorney with the progressive @entity166 , said his organization is " extremely disappointed by the administration 's decision to try what is arguably the most important criminal case the @entity60 has ever seen in an untested and flawed system instead of in our legitimate criminal justice system			1
" " our civilian justice system has a proven capacity to handle complex terrorism cases , " @entity165 said			0
" today 's decision will only continue to delay justice for the victims of 9/11 and their families			0
" @entity182 , director of the @entity184 's @entity183 , called the decision " a devastating blow to the rule of law			0
" " cases prosecuted by ( military commissions ) now are sure to be subject to continuous legal challenges and delays , and their outcomes will not be seen as legitimate			0
@entity60 deserve better than this , and the world expects more of us			0
" a senior defense official told @entity1 , " we were n't out advocating for this decision			0
but we do have a court system ( at @entity7 ) that is both prepared to handle , and is already handling , people accused of crimes relating to terrorism			2
" the official said a lack of funding from @entity24 on more permanent detainment options for terrorist suspects within the continental @entity60 " left the @entity27 short on options			0
" @entity12 promised to shut down the @entity7 detention facility within a year of taking office -- a promise he was unable to keep in the face of congressional resistance			1
@entity2 promised monday that the administration will continue working to shut down the facility and lift the restrictions on civilian trials imposed by @entity24			1
@entity1 's @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report			0

the decision is a reversal for the @entity12 administration , which had wanted civilian trials
@entity2 has promised to seek the death penalty for all the suspects
trial will be held at @entity7 , @entity8
