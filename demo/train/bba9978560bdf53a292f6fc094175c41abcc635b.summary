-- you may not have noticed it , but in the midst of all the usual finger - pointing and polarization , a bit of actual problem - solving is underway in @entity9 politics			1
a coalition of unlikely allies has coalesced in recent months to advance criminal justice reform			1
these strange bedfellows -- from @entity14 such as sen. @entity15 to tea party darlings such as sen. @entity18 , from the @entity19 to @entity20 -- are all proposing reductions in mandatory minimum sentences			2
@entity9 attorney general @entity24 's calls for such reductions have been cheered by some of the same republicans who otherwise want to impeach him			0
in @entity29 , a conservative group called @entity30 has led the way on prison and sentencing reform -- earning plaudits from , among others , @entity36 progressives			1
why this rash of consensus ? well , for the right , it 's mainly about getting control of big government -- prisons now consume a quarter of the @entity45 's budget , and state prison spending has been on a multidecade boom with little corresponding " return on investment			0
" for the left , it 's mainly about social justice -- the disparity in criminal sentencing for crack versus powder cocaine has a long - documented racial dimension , and blindly filling the " school - to - prison pipeline " has seemed misguided and cruel			1
democrats and @entity27 agree the metastasis of the prison - industrial complex is unhealthy			1
but for each side there are also benefits to acknowledging the other side 's rationale			0
in a @entity27 sometimes perceived as intolerant , @entity67 's embrace of sentencing reform lets him to show his concern for minorities			1
civil rights democrats , meanwhile , get to embrace fiscal responsibility			0
the criminal justice deal - making suggests a possible way forward for our politics : crosspartisanship			1
@entity78 may look like bipartisanship , but it 's different			0
@entity82 compromise typically splits the difference between the views of two parties , giving each side less than its ideal outcome			2
a crosspartisan approach , by contrast , finds issues where people from both parties converge on a common principle , even if for different reasons , and achieve an outcome that 's ideal to both			2
where else might such crosspartisanship take hold ? curbing government surveillance is a possibility			1
reducing crony capitalism is another			1
even reform of the federal tax code , an arena as full of political landmines as crime and punishment used to be , might be feasible			2
on surveillance , @entity110 's revelations have scrambled party affiliations , bringing civil libertarians from left and right together to push back against the @entity114			2
liberals hate the size of the national security state because they are wary of war ; conservatives hate it because they are wary of government			0
on crony capitalism , @entity27 since 2008 have blamed the housing and financial collapse on the profligate policies of quasigovernmental agencies such as @entity126 and @entity127 , while @entity14 have blamed unregulated and predatory @entity129 firms			1
it 's possible , of course , that they 're both substantially right			0
the moment is ripe for a liberal to say that government created the conditions for corruption in housing finance , and for a conservative to say that the absence of government accelerated such corruption			0
perhaps both sides can agree that when public policy allows businesses to privatize gain while socializing loss , that 's neither true capitalism nor good government			1
on taxes , @entity27 @entity150 member @entity149 of @entity151 recently put forward a framework for tax reform that , while admittedly going nowhere legislatively , did take aim at tax expenditures -- loopholes -- that disproportionately benefit the privileged			1
he 's not alone among conservatives , and they may be able to join with liberals who see such tax expenditures as welfare for the rich			0
i 'm not suggesting by any means that we 're about to enter some golden age of collaboration in our politics			2
on plenty of issues -- making it easier for unions to organize workers or cutting taxes on the rich -- there are still irreconcilable policy differences that reflect deeper differences in worldview			2
some people , like me , think unions are generally a force for good ; others see them as inherently inefficient , even evil			0
some people divide the country into " makers " and " takers " ; others find that division and its implications repugnant			0
so the fighting will in most cases continue			0
but in the same way that the @entity9 in foreign policy can sometimes partner with adversaries or rivals -- simply because it is in our interest in that moment to do so -- perhaps in domestic politics we can foster more such pragmatism			1
if that 's going to happen , though , it 'll be up to us as citizens to say that we want it			0
we 'll have to reward elected leaders for this style of crosspartisan problem - solving			2
we 'll have to resist punishing them for even talking to " the enemy			0
" and then more leaders will have to learn to think -- and lead -- outside the lines of party			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

@entity216 : both parties have come together to advance criminal justice reform
**liu** : their deal - making suggests a way forward for politics : crosspartisanship
he says partnering with rivals sometimes is pragmatic and works in our interests
**liu** : other areas both parties can agree on : curbing surveillance , crony capitalism
