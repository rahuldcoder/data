@entity0 -- is child obesity a form of child neglect ? of course not			2
but , it seems , the ridiculous is now standard operating procedure in the upside down world of the @entity11 of @entity12 in @entity13			1
in a case making headlines around the country , the agency recently decided that a @entity19 third grader should be taken from his mother and placed in foster care			2
was this an instance of child abuse ? apparently not			2
was it an urgent situation that required this local government entity to immediately intervene and take the drastic step of separating a family ? it does n't seem so			2
in fact , county public defender @entity31 told reporters that his office would challenge the removal because the boy was not in imminent danger			2
here 's the alleged abuse : the 8 - year - old boy weighed more than 200 pounds , and officials essentially claimed that his mother was to blame for not doing enough to help her son lose weight			1
so they went into the home and took the child away			2
@entity11 spokeswoman @entity46 told the @entity47 that the boy 's condition constituted " a form of medical neglect			1
constituted to whom ? who made that determination ? was it a doctor or a social worker ? the boy reportedly caught the attention of the agency when his mother took him to the hospital last year because he was having trouble breathing			1
and , once someone determined that this was a case of neglect and not just a health issue , who made the subsequent life - altering decision to remove the child from his home and put him at tender mercies of a foster care system that is notoriously dysfunctional ? the answer to that question is n't clear			1
from the looks of it , this is precisely the kind of heavy - handed abuse for which social service agencies in communities across the country have become infamous over the past 20 years			1
many people claim that child protective services agencies often abuse their authority and act hastily , without respect for families or what 's best for the child			1
others defend the agencies , and claim that it 's better they err on the side of caution when dealing with the safety of children			0
of course , if there were genuine abuse , then social workers should intervene			0
but that 's not what we 're talking about here			0
@entity46 told the newspaper that her office had worked with the boy 's mother for over a year before deciding to remove him			1
that 's more than enough time to have detected any abuse , had there been any to detect			0
the agency claims that the boy 's weight gain stemmed from his home environment , and that his mother was not following doctor 's orders			1
undoubtedly there is something wrong here			0
the boy 's condition is n't normal			1
and , at the same time , child obesity is a growing problem in this country , fueled as much by inactivity as it is by an unhealthy diet			1
kids spend too much time indoors watching television or fiddling with video games when they should be outdoors exercising , running and playing			0
but since when is a parent totally to blame when a child weighs too much -- or perhaps , in the case of a teenager with an eating disorder , does n't weigh enough ? the issue is more complicated than that			0
the boy 's mother told the @entity47 , " they are trying to make it seem like i am unfit , like i do n't love my child			1
of course i love him			0
of course i want him to lose weight			0
it 's a lifestyle change , and they are trying to make it seem like i am not embracing that			0
it is very hard , but i am trying			0
" the people who run these social service agencies always claim that they 're acting in the best interests of the child			0
yet , in this case , that could be a tough sell			0
in the absence of actual abuse , taking a child away from his mother and placing him in foster care is not in anyone 's best interests -- not the child , not the mother and not the rest of society which will have to deal with the emotional fallout for years to come			1
what will become of this child ? what kind of person will he grow up to be ? will he be angry and bitter , and how will he express those feelings ? no matter what is causing the boy 's weight gain , the problem could get worse and not better with the stress that the agency is putting him through			1
the emotional effect on the boy is something at which lawyers for the mother are looking as they fight to get the boy back home			2
others say that county officials overreacted in seizing the boy , and now they 're overreaching in trying to justify their actions			0
" i think we would concede that some intervention is appropriate , " said @entity31			0
" but what risk became imminent ? when did it become an immediate problem ? " this boy needs help , and so does the mother			1
but they also need each other , and a government agency should n't be standing between them			0
the county social workers may not be able to help this child overcome his weight problem			1
but they can make it easier for others to help him by doing the right thing and immediately reuniting this family			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214			2

a 200 - pound boy who is 8 years old was taken away from his mother in @entity13
authorities said the mother was failing to control her son 's weight
@entity214 says taking the child away went too far
he says there are other ways to address problem short of breaking up a family
