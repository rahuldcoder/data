@entity0 , @entity1 -- pop superstar @entity3 has been ordered to cover up by a @entity5 farmer who took exception to her " inappropriate behavior " while filming a music video on his land			1
the controversy has erupted in @entity1 and was even discussed tuesday by lawmakers in the province 's elected assembly in @entity0			1
@entity3 , who was born in @entity15 but has @entity1 ancestry , is in @entity1 this week for sold - out shows at @entity0 's @entity18			1
the 23 - year - old had been given permission to film a video for the song " @entity23 " in a muddy barley field owned by farmer @entity25 outside @entity26 , about 10 miles from @entity0			1
@entity25 explained tuesday , " i did n't know who was coming			0
if the name ' @entity3 ' had been mentioned , well , no disrespect , but it would n't have meant anything			2
" however , he says that when he went to get his tractor monday and saw the singer stripping down to a bikini top , he stepped in to end the shoot			1
the local political representative said he " asked the film crew to stop , and they did			1
" @entity25 insisted that " there were no hard feelings			0
" he added : " i had a conversation with @entity3 ; we shook hands ; we parted company on good terms			2
i found her very gracious , and i hope she understands where i 'm coming from			0
" @entity47 had quickly spread of @entity3 's surprise appearance in the @entity1 countryside , and traffic came to a standstill as fans attempted to catch a glimpse of the star			2
@entity25 's wife shed more light on the incident tuesday , revealing that @entity3 had gone topless			1
@entity58 , who declined to give her first name , " what she was doing became more inappropriate			0
when she started to go topless , that 's what @entity25 was particularly objecting to -- things were getting out of hand			2
there was a man as well , and the behavior was getting more inappropriate			0
... it was n't the sort of thing @entity25 wanted young people ( those watching ) to see on his land			0
" however , mrs. @entity78 added : " the girl was very nice ; she shook hands with @entity25 several times " after he asked for the filming to stop			2
not to be deterred , @entity3 was back filming again in @entity0 on tuesday			1
but the controversy of the sexy shoot in the barley field rumbled on -- and even made it onto the agenda at the @entity89			0
@entity25 is a local representative with the @entity90 ( formerly led by @entity92 preacher the rev. @entity91 ) , and the @entity3 row led to a light - hearted exchange between lawmakers in the @entity89 on tuesday			1
@entity96 , of rival @entity98 party the @entity97 , addressed @entity100 leader @entity99 , @entity1 's first minister			0
@entity96 said , " i wonder if the first minister has had an opportunity to assess the potential damage from the news that the pop icon @entity3 was foiled in her filming ambitions yesterday , which i believe were no more sinister than appearing in a field in red , white and blue			1
" ( the latter are the colors of the @entity111 flag as well as the @entity113 one )			0
@entity99 replied , " i 'm pretty sure there was no problem with the colors involved ! " @entity99 had just been telling the assembly of his recent trade mission to the @entity113 to encourage @entity120 studios to make more movies in @entity1 .			0
