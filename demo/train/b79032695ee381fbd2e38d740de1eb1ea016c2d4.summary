law enforcement is girding itself for the possibility of more violent clashes like the ones that raged for days in the @entity34 suburb following the august 9 shooting			0
@entity28 's father calls for calm gov. @entity38 took authority from the @entity40 and gave it to state authorities in the days following @entity28 's shooting			2

the conversations are part of a broader behind - the - scenes debate about how to tackle poor police relations within black communities in the @entity34 region			0
some officials say one issue the @entity28 shooting has exposed is one faced by a number of small police departments -- less - experienced , lower - paid officers			1
