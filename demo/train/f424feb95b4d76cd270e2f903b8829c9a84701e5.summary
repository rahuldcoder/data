and pope @entity7 ( 1958 - 1963 )			1
that @entity5 , whose pontificate dominated the late 20th century , is on a fast - track to sainthood should not come as a surprise			0
at his death in 2005 , the crowds chanted , " @entity15 ! " ( sainthood now ! )			0
the @entity16 verified his first miracle , the curing of a @entity20 nun of @entity21 's , from which he also suffered , just two months after his death			1
he was beatified in 2011 and his second miracle , the healing of a @entity26 woman with an aneurism after her family prayed at one of his shrines , was ratified that same year			0
@entity7 's canonization , however , was not on the radar , but it makes sense			1
@entity5 presided over the @entity16 , the great midcentury meeting that completely transformed modern @entity35 , and which is now celebrating its 50th anniversary			2
pope @entity1 has emphasized the divine nature of this council 's work frequently over the last few months and has waived the requirement that two miracles be credited to his intervention			1
a @entity44 spokesman emphasized that because " no one doubts " @entity5 's holiness , @entity1 has decided to move forward with the dual canonization			1
( early @entity49 reports suggest december 8 , a sunday this year , and the @entity50 , as the most likely date			0
) why does a pope become a saint ? at its most basic , @entity55 believe , a saint is a holy person through whom @entity58 intervenes after his or her death to aid the living			0
over the first 1,500 years of @entity35 history , people generally became saints through popular acclamation rather than through a formal papal process			1
while there were some saints who were celebrated across the @entity70 world , the vast majority received only local or regional veneration			0
as with so many other @entity35 procedures , the reform movements in the medieval papacy gradually asserted control of the process of canonization			1
in 1588 , pope @entity78 instituted the " @entity79 , " a body intended to take complete charge of all processes of beatification and canonization			2
however , local communities and religious leaders have always sought to promote their local holy men and women as saints , and often started venerating people regardless of official @entity44 sanction			2
pope @entity5 , in fact , oversaw the canonization of more people ( 483 ) than had been canonized in the previous 500 years , in part to lend the weight of @entity16 authority to saints that had emerged throughout the global @entity35 world			1
seventy - eight of the 265 popes have been saints , which may seem like a large number , but this includes 52 out of the first 54 popes			0
after the sixth century , the rate of papal canonization rapidly decreased			0
by the time of the great medieval reform movements , most popes did not become saints and were not expected to do so , as sanctity became reserved for those not so deeply involved in worldly affairs			0
for example , pope @entity115 may have become a saint , but he was recognized for his quiet life as a hermit , rather than for his brief life as pope ( he was also an inspiration for @entity1 @entity124 's retirement )			1
over the modern era , pious leaders in local communities , people like @entity128 , and others of great piety outside the elite hierarchy were most likely to be recognized as saints			2
thus , the incipient canonization of these two popes does stand out as unusual			0
so what 's going on in @entity137 ? i turn back to the lessons of the history : decisions about sanctity almost always involve considerations about local contexts and contemporary needs			0
@entity5 's sainthood has been promoted by many of the more conservative elements within the @entity35 world			2
@entity7 , however , is something of a hero to more liberal groups because of his sponsorship of @entity16 perhaps in linking these two pontiffs , @entity1 is performing yet another act that emphasizes the continuity and the connections among @entity55 of all kinds , a theme that has dominated his papacy so far			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity166 : pope @entity1 announced the canonization of two predecessors
he says @entity7 's @entity16 was " divine " work , so @entity1 required only one miracle
people used to become saints by popular acclamation . papacy controlled process later , he says
@entity164 : in canonizing one conservative , one liberal pope , @entity1 sends unifying *message*
