-- @entity1 has been a citadel amidst potentially destabilizing forces for centuries , routinely blasted by gale - force winds , seismic activity and positioned near one of the world 's largest and most coveted oil reserves			1
but , having declared independence and with the establishment of a lucrative oil pipeline , @entity11 now has its sights set firmly on urban renewal in its capital			2
this year , the astonishing @entity18 project was completed by global architecture giant @entity19 , creating a building that developers hoped would become an icon for @entity1 's coastal skyline			1
@entity25 - born @entity24 , vice president of @entity19 , says building an " icon " is one of the most intimidating briefs for an architect			1
" it 's probably dangerous to try to do something iconic			0
the biggest challenge a designer faces is that blank sheet of paper , " he says , " and if you pile on the idea that you want something iconic ... " @entity39 : historic buildings in peril @entity19 ultimately created three flame - shaped towers , clad in orange and blue - tinted glass , encircling a honeycomb - roofed podium			1
this is @entity24 ' favorite building , although he is reluctant to take all of the credit			1
" i feel guilty because i get to take a bow for the work of 150 people who worked on this project , " he says			0
the towers ' shape was inspired by the city 's history of zoroastrian fire worship and its ongoing connection with natural gas			2
" the client absolutely latched onto the idea of the flame , and then it became an interesting conversation about how literal that would be			0
" view a hi - res gallery of @entity24 ' favorite buildings whether your tower looks like a flame , or merely evokes the concept , comes down , it seems , to how much it flickers at the roof line , and @entity24 says a dedicated team worked exclusively on refining the towers ' quiffs			1
" they had long conversations about that moment when a candle is burning , the gestural moment when it catches the wind			0
somebody drew that a hundred times in the computer , and once that 's drawn it gets passed through different programs , and the contractors have to further rationalize it			0
" watch ' @entity89 the towers posed numerous other challenges			2
they had to be weighted to withstand potential earthquakes , and parts needed to be constructed without the use of cranes , due to @entity1 's harsh winds			1
the site is large , but dense , containing offices , a hotel and residential apartments above a shopping mall , above a parking lot			0
" making all those spaces work in tandem was the biggest engineering challenge of all , " @entity24 admits			1
but , standing at the top of one tower shortly before the building was completed , @entity24 found himself marveling at another unexpected feat. " rare is the place in the world where you can stand in one tower ... and have two other towers that seem to form a space that i was n't clever enough to anticipate , " he says			1
" maybe i was just drunk on the accomplishment but that space up there is really magical			0
" ' @entity122 ' towers shape city 's future " somebody will have a hotel room or office where they 'll look across and be part of those three objects in the sky and that , for me , is kind of spiritual			2
" the building @entity24 most wishes he 'd designed is the @entity134 , a concrete @entity136 chapel in @entity137 , @entity138 , designed by @entity140 - born architect @entity139			1
completed in 1954 , long before the advent of computer - aided design , the chapel 's roof and walls curve and slope in response to the hill on which they sit			1
today , many architects would find such complexity impossible to execute without the aid of computer , @entity24 says			1
" within the context of that period , i think it 's really a piece of sculpture			0
" he particularly admires the approach to the chapel , which winds up a hill and past some trees			2
" when i went there , it was one of those charmingly underdone things			0
that 's true of a lot of @entity139 's work -- you have to work to get there			1
that processional route is special and comes from @entity139 looking at the @entity173			2
" @entity24 believes the inflection of humanity in @entity139 's work is what makes him relevant today			1
" modernists were really fascinated with the machine , and buildings as machines for living			0
i find that idea compelling but at the same time , machines can be soulless , and we 're now in an age where we expect our machines to have a little spirit , " he said			0
" @entity139 was starting to do that in his later work			2
mid-corbusier was very angular , but @entity137 is more gestural and evocative			2
you walk up and go ' oh , wow ! ' you get that lump in your throat			0
which goes back to what everybody 's trying to do when they start with that blank sheet of paper			0
" @entity0 's special coverage sometimes carries sponsorship			0
@entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity25 - born architect @entity24 picks the @entity18 in @entity1 as his favorite building
building towers was a challenge says @entity24 and had to be weighted to withstand earthquakes
@entity24 wishes he had designed @entity134 , a concrete @entity136 chapel in @entity137 , @entity138
designed by @entity140 - born architect @entity139 , the modernist building was completed in 1954
