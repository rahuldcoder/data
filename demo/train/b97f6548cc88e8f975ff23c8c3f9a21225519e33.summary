-- @entity2 's peripatetic foreign minister @entity1 spent last thursday in @entity3 in negotiations with leading @entity6 officials			1
@entity1 's visit comes at a very critical juncture in @entity10 - @entity6 relations , as saber - rattling dangerously escalates over the @entity10 ' ever - more stringent sanctions and @entity6 's threat to close the @entity14			1
@entity1 's visit also comes as @entity17 - @entity16 tensions in @entity18 rise in the wake of the @entity10 withdrawal			2
these tensions threaten the very survival of @entity18 as a united country and have the potential to adversely affect @entity6 - @entity2 relations -- in light of @entity6 's strong support of the @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity2 's sympathy for the @entity16 cause			1
@entity6 and @entity2 's divergent stances on @entity31 as well as @entity2 's decision to host a @entity34 anti-missile radar facility close to the @entity6 border have added even more to the strain			1
reports suggest that much of the talks between @entity1 and his @entity6 counterparts were devoted to ironing out some of these bilateral differences			0
a major objective of the @entity1 visit , however , was to kick - start negotiations between @entity6 and the @entity44 over @entity6 's nuclear enrichment program			1
the group comprises the permanent five members of the @entity48 : @entity49 , the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity10 , plus @entity53			0
major @entity55 powers believe the enrichment program is part of @entity6 's clandestine ambition to acquire nuclear weapons capability			1
negotiations between @entity6 and the @entity44 have dragged on for years , with @entity6 insisting on its right under the @entity62 to enrich uranium for civilian purposes and the @entity55 powers demanding that it suspend its enrichment program to allay fears that it is covertly engaged in building nuclear weapons			1
the most recent @entity72 report , issued on november 8 , 2011 , brought the dispute to a boiling point by stating for the first time that it had documentation that led it to believe nuclear weapons work had been done under a " structured program " up to 2003 , and that " some may still be ongoing			0
" while this information was not new , the report provided the @entity10 and its @entity81 allies the excuse to impose even more stringent sanctions on @entity6			0
the proposed sanctions could seriously damage prospects for @entity6 's energy exports by targeting the @entity87 and preventing it from carrying on financial transactions abroad			2
they are thus aimed at hitting @entity6 where it really hurts , although the prospect of @entity6 's oil exports being forced off the market also threatens to drastically increase the price of crude internationally			0
@entity6 's ruling elite perceives sanctions that target @entity6 's export of crude as existential threats			2
@entity6 has , therefore , threatened to block the @entity14 , through which a fifth to a quarter of the world 's oil passes , if sanctions are imposed on its export of crude			1
@entity6 's capacity to block the strait for any length of time might be debatable , but it is clear that threats and counter-threats have reached a point where a shooting war can not be ruled out completely			0
this is the last thing @entity2 wants to see , caught as it is between its @entity34 membership and its dependence on energy supplies from @entity6			1
@entity119 is fully aware that the cost of a war with @entity6 would far exceed that of the @entity10 invasion and occupation of @entity18			0
@entity2 realizes that @entity6 is no @entity18 , and that @entity3 can inflict major damage on @entity10 interests and those of its allies , including @entity2 , in the @entity128			2
in this context , it becomes clear that it was @entity1 's primary mission in @entity3 to persuade the @entity6 to resume negotiations with @entity44			0
he delivered a note from the @entity134 's foreign policy chief , @entity133 , inviting @entity6 to resume such talks , and @entity6 foreign minister @entity136 apparently responded positively			2
it is worth noting that @entity6 's chief negotiator on nuclear issues , @entity138 , announced a few days ago that @entity6 was willing to resume negotiations with @entity44 on the nuclear enrichment issue			2
@entity136 suggested in his news conference with @entity1 that @entity2 would be the ideal venue for these negotiations , a suggestion that is likely to be accepted by @entity146			0
@entity147 was the venue for the last round of negotiations a year ago and it appears logical that the parties reconvene there			0
it is likely these negotiations will be re-started , and with @entity2 facilitating and providing a venue for them , @entity2 could be primarily instrumental in preventing a catastrophe in the @entity128			0
it could even help ease @entity55 sanctions against @entity6 , especially the most recent threatening financial transactions with @entity6 's @entity87 , which could hurt @entity2 's ability to pay for its energy supply purchases from @entity6			1
it would also help put @entity6 - @entity2 relations , recently mired in disputes surrounding @entity31 and @entity34 's radar facilities in @entity2 , on a more even keel and help defuse tensions between these two most important political actors in the @entity128			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity169 : @entity2 's minister visits @entity6 as tensions rise between @entity173 , @entity6
@entity169 notes @entity55 nations *vow* *stricter* sanctions on @entity6 over nuclear program
@entity6 *vow*s to close @entity14 ; he says @entity2 caught in the *middle* of disputes
@entity2 holding talks between @entity173 , @entity6 , he says , might head off *confrontation*
