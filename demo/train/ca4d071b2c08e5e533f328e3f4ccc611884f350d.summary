-- the " girl on bike " is a familiar trope in the motorcycle world , which is why the editor of @entity6 motorcycle blog @entity4 did n't pay much attention last year when images surfaced of a woman draped across the latest @entity10			1
but when the dealership responsible for the sexy images re-created them using men -- all bulging muscles and body hair , farmers ' tans and booty shorts -- they caught his attention			1
these were the images he wanted to talk about			1
" the conversation i really wanted to have is if you can put a girl on a bike , you should put a guy on a bike			1
and , if that looks silly to you , ( then ) you should rethink the other , " said @entity34 , editor of @entity4			2
" i 'm kind of tired of the ' pinup girl on motorcycle ' theme that our industry does , so it was kind of fun to see someone poke that in the eye , " @entity34 said			1
" i thought to myself , these are guys with a good sense of humor			2
they 're not afraid of pushing boundaries , which is what motorcycles are all about			2
" but the images did n't go beyond the motorcycle world until just last month when they became a viral sensation			1
you probably saw them on @entity60 or @entity61 or on one of numerous news websites that showed them off			2
the overwhelmingly enthusiastic response was far different from the one @entity34 got on @entity4 in august 2012 when reactions ranged from , " it 's nice to see it go the other way for once , " to " why oh why ! ! ! ! ! really ? ? ? ? ? ? @entity71 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " or , as one @entity6 motorcycle pr firm said , " half of this made us throw up in our mouth a little bit			1
" but where did the photos come from , and why did they surface again now ? both sets of images were the brainchild of @entity83 , general manager of @entity84 , a @entity10 dealership in @entity85 , @entity86			1
last year , he wanted his shop to be the first to circulate promotional images of the hotly anticipated @entity10			1
he wanted them to be sexy but tasteful , so fans would n't have reservations about using them as wallpaper on their office computer			0
" it 's not a big secret that beautiful women and motorcycles go together , but we 're not into g - strings , " @entity83 said in a phone interview			0
" there are smarter ways to go about it			0
" photographer and " @entity106 " blogger @entity104 helped style and shoot both sets of images			1
she also wanted to distinguish the photos of the female model from the " pervy images " that have defined motorcycle marketing ; she prefers to see women riding bikes rather than hanging off them , she said			1
but as long as women were modeling , " we wanted to do something that was classy and better looking , so the content would be accessible to a wider audience			0
" they shot the photos the same day the @entity122 arrived in the shop			0
@entity83 said he achieved his goal of being the first dealership to circulate images of the hottest bike on the market , bearing @entity84 's name and logo			1
as they spread throughout the world , much of the response was positive			1
there was some backlash , too			0
tasteful or not , some said it was just another set of images of a model draped on a bike			1
inspiration struck @entity83 a few weeks later , he said , in one those " you know what we should totally do ? " moments : " we should totally do the same poses with the guys in the shop			0
" as @entity104 remembers it , they had talked about the idea of responding to the backlash by reversing the gender of the models			1
" most people loved it , but others were like , ' oh , a chick on a bike , ' " she said in a phone interview			2
" ok , we 'll give you something different then			0
" @entity83 called a meeting and announced the plan to reshoot the images using @entity84 employees			2
a few refused to take part , he recalls , but most were enthusiastic			0
they drew numbers to choose who would pose for each shot			0
senior technician @entity175 was one of the last to choose			0
he is pictured precariously perched on all fours on the bike 's seat			2
" i thought it was a fantastic , hilarious idea , " said @entity175 , who has worked in the shop for 11 years			0
" it seems like we always get a lot of flak from customers whenever we put something up on our @entity60 page that has a beautiful woman on a motorcycle , so making light of all of that and having a good time doing it seemed like a good idea			2
" holding the pose proved to be a challenge for the 5 - foot - 10 - inch , 230 - pound technician , especially in slingback shoes and booty shorts			0
" it was that kind of day , when it was super-hot outside , so holding a pose like that with sweat everywhere and my knees slipping all over the place gave me a new appreciation for what models do , " he said			2
both versions of the images remained popular within the motorcycle community , sparking a few copycat male pinup shoots			1
it 's not entirely clear why the images resurfaced again recently			2
@entity34 from the @entity4 blog said his referral traffic showed it got moving on @entity60 , caught on in @entity218 social media circles , then moved into feminist media , catching the attention of mainstream media outlets			0
@entity83 said he is thrilled with the renewed attention			0
there 's been some negative reaction toward both versions , he said , but much more positive attention , overall			1
" we just did it for fun , for the notoriety , and it went crazy , " he said			0
" a lot of people have turned it into something it was n't intended to be , but that 's the beautiful thing about artistic interpretation			0
" @entity34 said he hopes it 's a wake - up call to the motorcycle industry that female riders might be attracted by a more balanced approach to marketing			1
" if you want more gender equality in the consumer base , we have to have more gender equality in marketing and the way you 're approaching things , " he said			0
" gender roles are still an issue that people find relevant , and i think that 's why we saw it getting picked up in niches and exploding from there			0

photo set of men posing on a @entity10 motorcycle goes viral
to some , the images are a welcome *departure* from the " girl on bike " trope
images created partly in response to negative reaction to images of female models
