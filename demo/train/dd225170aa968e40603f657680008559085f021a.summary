" @entity0 ... strongly condemns and denounces this cowardly terrorist act that is rejected by true @entity4 religion as well as the rest of the religions and beliefs			1
" so reads the statement issued by @entity9 , where i grew up , the day the offices of " @entity12 " came under attack , with the loss of 12 lives			1
last sunday , to show further solidarity with the victims , the @entity9 ambassador to @entity17 joined other world leaders in @entity21 for a unity rally to celebrate free speech			1
this is consistent with the face @entity9 presents to the outside world			1
visitors to the website of the @entity9 embassy in @entity30 are invited to " learn ... how the @entity32 's political system is rooted in @entity4 's traditions which call for peace , justice , equality , consultation and respect for the rights of the individual			1
" just two days before the @entity21 rally , my friend @entity41 was removed , in shackles , from a mini-bus outside the @entity47 mosque in @entity48 as a large crowd gathered around him after friday prayers			1
according to eyewitnesses , he closed his eyes and raised his head skyward as a security officer approached him from behind with a large cane and started to beat him			0
witnesses say @entity41 was lashed 50 times			1
afterwards , he was taken back to prison where he is serving a 10 - year sentence — for blogging			0
@entity41 's next flogging was set to take place today , but @entity9 authorities postponed it due to medical advice , his wife said			1
she expects he will be flogged again next week — and every following week — until his sentence of 1,000 lashes is complete			2
@entity41 is officially charged with " adopting liberal thought , " " founding a liberal website , " and " insulting @entity4			1
" he has become the latest symbol of the two - faced policy his country takes towards human rights			2
@entity9 is a strong @entity75 ally that has enjoyed virtually unconditional support from the @entity75 for decades			2
president @entity77 famously held hands with its monarch , @entity79 , as the two strolled through his @entity83 , @entity82 ranch during the @entity79 's 2005 state visit			0
president @entity85 was widely criticized for appearing to bow to @entity79 at a g - 20 summit in @entity87			0
in the same month that @entity88 horrified the world with its brutal beheading of journalist @entity91 , @entity9 publicly beheaded 19 people , for crimes ranging from smuggling cannabis to sorcery			1
limb amputations for theft are sanctioned by the state religion			0
in addition to oil , @entity9 is the world 's leading exporter of @entity103 , an ultra-conservative strain of @entity4			1
the country touts itself as the birthplace of the religion of peace — yet underlines the @entity4 declaration of " @entity110 " on its flag with a sword			0
@entity113 was a @entity9 citizen , as were 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11			2
why does a world outraged by the horrific actions of @entity88 and the @entity117 turn a blind eye to the way this country treats its own citizens ? the first reason is obvious			1
it is n't just our governments			0
every time we fill our cars with gas , we all bow to the @entity9 king			2
the second is more complex			0
online videos of @entity41 's flogging show worshipers from the mosque , including young children , running excitedly towards the square to watch the beating			1
afterwards , the crowd erupts into cheers and applause , chanting " @entity138 ! " ( @entity139 is @entity140 ! ) in unison			0
the public likely considers @entity41 guilty of blasphemy and apostasy			2
a 2013 @entity147 poll found that large numbers in @entity4 countries favor the death penalty for leaving @entity4 — including 88 % of @entity151 and 62 % of @entity152 , as well as majorities in @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity157			0
of course , these views do n't represent all @entity152			0
but contrary to what we 're usually told , they are n't just held by a fringe minority either			0
many of these countries do n't have populations willing to rally en masse to support free speech and pluralism the way @entity17 did			0
the change has to first come from within			0
@entity41 has sacrificed a great deal to make this change happen			1
the world must support him and call @entity9 out on its hypocrisy			1
some time ago , just 50 miles east of where @entity41 is being held today , another dissident once spoke of change , of challenging the status quo , of radical new ideas that would ultimately transform his society			1
he was ostracized , persecuted , and eventually driven from his city by those wanting to kill him			0
he was @entity182 , the @entity183 ; his persecutors , the @entity186 tribe of @entity187			0
@entity152 endeavor to emulate the life of @entity182			0
@entity9 has instead chosen to emulate the @entity186			2
this week , @entity41 spent his 31st birthday imprisoned and wounded			2
with enough awareness , we can put enough international pressure on the @entity9 government to ensure that he spends his next one with his wife and their three beautiful children .			2

@entity9 condemned the attack on the @entity201 offices in @entity21 as a " cowardly terrorist act "
but @entity204 writes that days later the @entity32 flogged blogger @entity41 for crimes including " founding a liberal website "
@entity204 says the world turns a blind eye to this " hypocrisy " from a country where he says change needs to come from within
