@entity12 was passed by @entity17 but clipped the bike of his fellow @entity28 rider when he tried to retake second place			2
@entity1 sets @entity7 pace at @entity25 the @entity31 was later handed a drive - through penalty for an illegal move , relegating him to fifth place and denying the 24 - year - old his first podium position			1
" i leave here with a broken collarbone and he with a ride - through penalty , good for him ! yet again i come out worse off , " @entity12 told the @entity7 website			1
" we only just recovered from the nightmare of the last operation and now i 'm hurt again			0
it is very unfair , i do n't deserve it			0
" i was having a good race , the goal was to ensure another podium and i had it in my grasp			0
now it counts for nothing			0
@entity17 overtook me , i passed him back and i had the better line			0
he just came into me , releasing the brakes , and i could do nothing			0
" that incident left seven - time world champion @entity57 as @entity1 's closest chaser , but he was beaten to second place by fellow @entity31 @entity60			1
it was still @entity57 's best finish since leaving @entity62 for @entity63 , but he trails former teammate @entity64 by 31 points			2
world champion @entity64 finished fifth to be 12 points clear of @entity1 and 18 ahead of @entity12 as he became the youngest rider to start in 150 grands prix in all classes			1
the 24 - year - old @entity18 had a bad start to the day when he crashed in practice , injuring his finger and wrecking his bike			0
the race featured several casualties as home hope @entity77 , @entity79 and @entity80 crashed out -- as did the latter 's @entity62 teammate @entity81 , but the veteran @entity83 returned to the track to finish 13th			0
@entity1 , in his first season with @entity28 , triumphed by more than 14 seconds as he continued the dominance he showed in practice and qualifying to win for the first time at @entity25			1
the 25 - year - old won the opening race of the season in @entity93 , but failed to finish in @entity94 as @entity64 triumphed on home soil , and was third in @entity20 as @entity12 led a @entity96 1 - 2 .			2
