-- in @entity1 , the " little emperors " may have no clothes , at least when it comes to economic risk - taking and being conscientious workers			1
that 's the finding of a new study that looks at the effects of @entity1 's one - child policy on the current generation of young adults in the world 's second - largest economy			1
@entity1 enacted strict rules mandating that families in urban areas be limited to just one child in 1979 in an effort to curb a rapidly rising population			1
since then @entity1 's economy has taken off , while its population growth has slowed , and wages and living standards have soared			2
but @entity1 's young people may be in search of security and office jobs now and less likely to become a new generation of stockbrokers , business - starters or high risk managers			2
in a paper published in the latest issue of @entity35 , a team of researchers from @entity38 studied a group of 421 individuals born both right before and right after the implementation of @entity1 's one - child policy			1
they tested them with a series of games involving trading money with each other that measured how trusting they were and how willing they were to go after " winning " transactions			0
one of the authors , professor @entity53 of @entity54 , said that the groups of children born after the policy were considerably more risk - averse , less trusting and trustworthy , pessimistic and less competitive than children born before the policy			2
the study concluded that " the causal impact of the @entity62 is to reduce the probability of choosing a risky occupation ( defined to include private firm managers , stockbrokers , people who are self - employed or freelancing ) by 22.7 percent			0
" " these were quite large differences , " @entity68 said from @entity69 , @entity38			0
" it was eye - opening how much more nervous and less trusting they were and implies that these behaviors could have wide - ranging economic and social implications			0
" the study found that 27 % of the children born before 1979 were from single - child families , while 82 % of the individuals born by 1983 studied were only children			1
the subjects were all from @entity81 and were better educated than the average citizen , but the authors believe that the results should be similar in other @entity1 cities and populations			0
and rather than getting better , the study found that as a new generation of children of only children grows up , the effects they found are likely to " magnify " as fewer @entity1 grow up with extended families			0
the authors said that much of the outcome of the study could be explained by the effects of the one - child policy on family values in @entity1			1
many opinion pieces in @entity1 media criticize what is seen as a selfish wave of young people who have always gotten whatever they want from doting parents , causing them to be nicknamed " the little emperors			0

children born under @entity1 's one - child policy less likely to take economic risk , study finds
only children are often criticized in media , *earning* the nickname " little emperors "
@entity1 's one - child policy began in 1979 in urban areas to curb population growth
