-- @entity2 's lawmakers have taken the historic step of unanimously approving goal - line technology systems for use in the sport			1
world soccer 's global governing body @entity7 and the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) made the announcement following a meeting in @entity12 on thursday			1
@entity7 intend for goal - line technology to be used at december 's @entity14 in @entity15 , and if successful it will also be implemented at the @entity16 and the @entity17 in @entity18			1
two systems , designed by technology companies @entity21 and @entity22 , have been approved after going through two phases of @entity7 testing			1
@entity26 chief opposed to goal - line technology @entity7 president @entity28 had previously opposed the move but said the turning point had been an incident at the @entity32 involving a second round clash between @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity28 was present when midfielder @entity37 's shot bounced well over the goal - line but was not awarded by the officials in a match @entity34 went on to lose 4 - 1			1
" it is a real approach of modern times in football , " he told reporters			0
" it is so important because the objective in football is to score goals			0
it 's a help for the referee			0
" i 'm happy , i 'm pleased we are able to go forward			0
when it comes to high level competition and you have the technology and you do n't use it something is wrong			0
" i have changed my attitude towards technology because of @entity37 's kick in @entity61			2
that was the moment for me to say ' you are the president of @entity7 and you can not afford that in the next @entity17 something similar will happen			2
' " the @entity64 welcomed the news , expressing its intention to bring in goal - line technology in the near future			1
" the @entity64 has been a long - term advocate of goal line technology , " read a statement on the organization 's website			2
" we will engage in discussions with both @entity22 and @entity21 in the near future with a view to introducing goal - line technology as soon as is practically possible			1
" the @entity9 is comprised of @entity7 and the four @entity79 - based football associations of @entity34 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			2
it is a body which decides on any proposed changes to the rules of soccer			2
blog : will @entity7 regret opening technology can of worms ? the announcement follows @entity28 's recent calls for goal - line technology to be introduced in reaction to an incident that occurred during @entity95 in @entity96 and @entity97			1
co-hosts @entity97 saw a goal not given during a must - win group - stage match with @entity34 , when @entity101 cleared @entity103 's shot after it looked to have crossed the line			2
following the game on june 19 , @entity28 used his official @entity107 account to declare : " after last night 's match # @entity108 is no longer an alternative but a necessity			0
" but his stance on the issue is at odds with @entity115 , the president of @entity117 football 's governing body @entity26			2
the @entity26 chief told @entity0 in may : " i 'm against the technology			0
if you say ok to goal - line technology , then it is offside technology , then penalty area technology , and we stop the football			1
" i want human people -- it 's easy			0
i understand the fans because they want justice but with an additional referee we have the same justice			0
" in addition to @entity135 's " goal " at @entity95 , @entity34 have been involved in one other high - profile goal - line controversies			1
in the 1966 @entity17 final , @entity34 were awarded a goal against @entity35 when @entity140 's shot in extra-time rebounded off the underside of the crossbar			0
@entity34 went on to win the match 4 - 2 at @entity145			0
at the same meeting , @entity7 also confirmed it would permit the wearing of headscarves during a trial period			0
as there was no medical risk to wearing headscarves when playing a game of football , it has decided to relent on a ban introduced in 2007			0
soccer 's governing body had prevented teams wearing the traditional headscarves -- which protect the modesty of @entity161 girls and women -- for safety reasons and to prevent political or religious statements .			1
