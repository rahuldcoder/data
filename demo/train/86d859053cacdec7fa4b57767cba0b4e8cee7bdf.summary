-- last month , president @entity1 proposed cutting almost $ 72 billion from @entity2 , the program that provides health care to @entity6 's poor			1
such deep reductions are necessary , he declared , to bring down our staggering national debt			0
but what if there were a way to both save taxpayer dollars and improve @entity2 patients ' health ? we can achieve both if we are willing to consider an unorthodox solution : pay @entity2 recipients who are smokers to quit using cigarettes			1
thirty - three percent of the @entity2 population smokes , compared with 20 % of the @entity6 population , according to the @entity21			1
evidence of the dangers of smoking , coupled with smoking bans and steep tobacco taxes , has cut the smoking rate in half for the overall @entity6 population over the past 50 years			1
now , it is widely acknowledged that smoking is largely isolated in vulnerable populations			0
why do n't @entity2 smokers quit in response to policies that are effective for others ? one reason is that investing in preventive health care is difficult when you live month - to - month			1
but an indulgence the poor really ca n't afford is cigarettes			2
a pack - a - day smoker could save more than $ 2,000 per year by quitting			1
how would the proposed incentive system work ? smokers on @entity2 would receive small payments in return for quitting or getting cessation counseling as a step toward quitting			1
participants would have to hold up their end of the bargain			0
they would get paid only if medical claims data indicated that they were getting counseling or they tested to be smoke - free			1
tests can easily be conducted using breathalyzers to measure carbon monoxide levels			0
it may seem implausible that such a limited compensation could push anyone to quit a practice as addictive as cigarette smoking , but there is solid evidence that it works			2
research on addiction has repeatedly demonstrated that small payments have persuaded even cocaine addicts to stop using			0
furthermore , in my research , i have found that the financial motivation to quit is more effective for low - income smokers than a motivation based on health concerns			2
small payments can be effective by providing tangible , immediate and clear - cut gains			2
taxpayers would have a lot to gain from this approach , too			0
medical care for tobacco - related diseases costs @entity2 an estimated $ 22 billion every year			1
treating the many illnesses associated with smoking -- emphysema , coronary heart disease and lung cancer , to name a few -- is expensive			0
pregnant smokers risk premature childbirth and often expensive medical treatment for their newborns			0
sensible as they are , incentive payments to smokers on @entity2 face many obstacles before they can be adopted by the federal government			2
many people , including politicians , will chafe at paying people to do something they ought to do on their own			0
smoking carries the taint of a moral vice , a bad habit that should require no incentive to abandon			0
but providing incentives to promote positive behaviors is a common practice and often uncontroversial			0
employers and life insurers , for example , increasingly provide financial incentives to stop smoking			0
they consider these incentives good investments			0
paying such incentives could both improve health for the poor and lower @entity2 costs for taxpayers			1
another obstacle to implementation is a lack of research on how best to design such a program for low - income populations			2
while in previous studies of heroin users i found that paying higher incentive payments is both more powerful and more cost - effective , we do not know the best level of payments for @entity2 smokers			1
also we do not know whether it would be better to pay for using the counseling or only for actually stopping smoking , or a mix. we are getting closer to answering these important questions			0
ten states , including my own state of @entity137 , were just granted the approval and the funds from the federal government to test the effectiveness of incentive payments in @entity2			1
my research group , in collaboration with the state , will be investigating how a smoking - cessation program based on such payments could be made maximally cost - effective			2
we want to save @entity2 money while improving recipients ' health			1
what if we really could make a difference by paying a little to save a lot ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			1

@entity156 says paying @entity2 recipients to quit could save taxpayers money
she says @entity2 recipients smoke more than rest of population , can afford it less
she says tobacco - related disease costs medicaie $ 22 billion a year ; incentives can help
@entity156 : *challenge* in *structuring* such a program ; some states are *experimenting* now
