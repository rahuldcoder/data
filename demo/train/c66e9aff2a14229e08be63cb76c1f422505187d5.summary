editor 's note : @entity2 , a professor at the @entity4 @entity3 and research associate of the @entity6 at @entity7 , is the author of " how terrorism ends : understanding the decline and demise of @entity12 " ( @entity9 , september 2009 )			1
this article represents her views only , not necessarily those of any @entity4 government agency			1
@entity2 says recent events have raised new concerns about terrorism and @entity20			1
( @entity21 ) -- president @entity22 entered office hoping to displace the global war on terrorism with a new age of engagement , thereby replacing fear with hope and relinquishing terrorism as the centerpiece of @entity4 foreign policy			1
yet terrorism is once again in the center of the bull 's - eye for @entity34 policymakers			0
the war in @entity36 is at a watershed			1
having been relatively neglected in favor of the intervention in @entity41 , the administration must now decide whether to recommit to a full - fledged counter-insurgency , perhaps with an additional 40,000 @entity4 troops on top of the more than 60,000 already slated for the conflict			1
alternatively , some argue for a strategy that focuses on the original problem -- of @entity20 and its extremist associates rather than more ambitious state - building			1
the former would appear to be more costly and perhaps a slippery slope to a protracted war that might not be winnable ; the latter could be ineffective in halting the potential resurgence in an unstable region of an @entity20 threat to the @entity4 and its allies			1
meanwhile , in the past few weeks it seems clear that the @entity4 has foiled a series of terrorist plots that collectively constituted the gravest threat to the @entity4 homeland since 9/11			1
@entity63 , a 24 - year - old @entity36 immigrant , has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in @entity67 , while a @entity68 has been arrested , accused of attempting to destroy a @entity71 , @entity70 , skyscraper			2
in addition , charges have been made against three men in @entity75 for plotting to attack a @entity77 base and another man has been charged with conspiring to blow up federal buildings in @entity80			0
is @entity20 resurgent ? is the @entity4 under threat because of the failure to capture or kill @entity83 ? @entity4 need to take a deep breath , because the answer to both questions , while requiring some caveats , is no. @entity20 is facing more negative trends than what international forces are facing in @entity36 , although it is always possible that @entity4 missteps could rekindle the extremist terror narrative and organization			1
similarly , killing @entity83 will not end @entity20 , but neither will his fugitive status sustain it			2
to answer the question of how @entity20 will end , we can draw upon decades of experience with how other terrorist campaigns have fizzled out			2
the history of terrorist groups points to various ways they may decline and end : the destruction of leadership , failure to transition between generations , achieving their stated cause , negotiating a settlement , succumbing to military or police repression , losing popular support and transitioning to other malignant activities such as criminality or war			2
not all of these pathways are probable for every group , and they are not all relevant to @entity20			1
for example , it is clear that @entity20 will not end if @entity83 is killed			2
groups that have ended this way such as @entity126 's @entity125 or @entity128 's @entity127 have been hierarchical , reflecting to some degree a cult of personality and lacking a viable successor , none of which describes @entity20			2
it also will not die out between generations , as did many of the left - wing groups of the 1970s			0
@entity20 has transitioned beyond its original structure and is a multigenerational threat			2
likewise , achieving the cause or reaching a negotiated settlement does not apply to @entity20			2
groups that have achieved their ends have had limited goals			0
@entity20 seeks maximalist goals : using violence to mobilize the global @entity150 community , throw off the influence of the @entity152 , eliminate support for @entity155 regimes and establish a new world order ( sometimes called a @entity157 ) is hardly realistic			1
the remaining pathways deserve greater scrutiny			0
although the campaign against @entity20 has yielded gratifying results , the limits of driving the core into hiding and reducing its capacity to operate have been demonstrated			2
democracies find it hard to sustain policy of repression at home or abroad , as it can undermine civil liberties and strain domestic support			0
@entity4 use of military force signified @entity176 resolve , killed @entity20 leaders and prevented attacks , all of which were vital ; but force alone can not drive this group to its end			1
a loss of popular support has ended many terrorist groups , and it is a plausible scenario for @entity20			1
support can be compromised through miscalculation , especially in targeting , and popular backlash			0
the @entity189 and @entity192 's @entity191 separatists come to mind			0
or a campaign can fail to convey a positive image or progress toward its goals , which amply applies to @entity20			2
while the group continues to be dangerous , the faltering popularity of this campaign with most @entity150 provides clear evidence of this dynamic underway			1
for instance , a @entity202 poll released in september showed a remarkable drop in support for suicide bombing and @entity83 in key muslim - majority countries such as @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity68			0
in @entity208 , whereas some 41 percent approved of suicide terror attacks five years ago , that number has fallen to a mere 5 percent today			0
finally , groups can transition from terrorism to other kinds of violence , escalating to insurgency or even conventional war , for example -- especially if there is state sponsorship			0
some argue that this may already have happened in the case of @entity20 and link the current debate over @entity36 strategy to this concern			1
in this regard , it is counterproductive to consider @entity20 as a global insurgency			0
this concept bestows legitimacy , emphasizes territorial control , encourages our enemies to join forces and puts the @entity4 into an us - versus - them strategic framework that precludes clear - eyed analyses of the strategies of leverage that are being used against the @entity4 and its allies			0
in short , if we are thinking about classic pathways to the end , the secret to undermining this campaign is not " winning hearts and minds " but enhancing @entity20 's tendency to lose them			0
more terrorist attacks will be attempted and a few will no doubt succeed in parts of the world , conceivably even in the @entity4			1
but it makes a significant difference whether such attacks are undertaken by a few recruits without proper training or support or by those who have managed to visit an @entity20 training camp in a safe haven with full support			1
thus far , the trends are heading in a favorable direction			0
even in its diminished state , @entity20 and its franchises remain armed and dangerous			0
this group can still hurt us			0
but appreciating how terrorist campaigns actually end offers the greatest promise for removing ourselves from the strategic myopia that currently grips much of @entity176 counter-terrorism efforts and for clarifying our political objectives			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity278 : terror arrests and @entity36 debate make it seem @entity20 is gaining
she says the reality is that the terror group is losing support
@entity2 : @entity4 should encourage the *disillusionment* with @entity20 in @entity150 world
