-- @entity1 has rejected claims that his charge to the 2011 @entity5 title was a procession , and says his @entity9 team 's ability to learn from their mistakes has been vital in delivering a second successive world championship			1
the @entity12 has been dominant this season , retaining his crown at the @entity16 @entity15 in early october			1
despite spinning out of the @entity17 with a puncture on sunday -- his first race retirement in over a year -- @entity1 still enjoys a 119 - point lead over second - placed @entity23 driver @entity22			1
@entity1 has won 11 out of the 18 races so far this season and paid tribute to the coolness of his team in helping him get the job done on the track			1
@entity1 equals @entity31 's record in taking pole in @entity33 " one thing is for sure -- such a year does n't come your way too often , " he told the sport 's official website ahead of the final race in @entity37 on november 27			1
" it was a well - woven tale right from the beginning without a moment of buckling			0
" the car never let us down -- and we never let ourselves down			0
sure , there were some small issues here and there , but we never ran into a bad - case scenario -- nothing like that at all			0
" the major improvement over last season is that we have never been irritated by situations			2
even if the boat started to rock we never stumbled -- probably something that was not quite there last year			0
" @entity1 's huge lead in the drivers ' championship , coupled with @entity9 's second year at the top of the constructors ' standings , have led some commentators to declare their twin triumph " easy			1
" but the 24 - year - old rejects the idea that the @entity71 - based @entity70 team 's season has been straightforward			2
latest f1 standings after @entity17 " what became clear over the course of the season was that our car has n't been as dominant as it was in 2010 , but what really made a huge difference was we -- the people -- have grown into one strong force , " he said			1
" we have been much more stable and obviously have learned from our 2010 mistakes			2
it is funny to get comments after a successful race : you hear descriptions like ' easy , ' ' walk in the park ' and so on -- and it was definitely nothing of the sort at any race of the season			2
" every victory was hard fought and , contrary to what people might think , it was closer , much closer than it looked from the outside			0
" everything had to come together -- and that was what was so special , that we 've managed to make it come together at so many races			2
" @entity1 pointed to his victories in @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 as the highlights of his season and says he has become a better driver in 2011			1
but he said he wo n't be getting complacent ahead of the 2012 season , with a chasing pack keen to prevent @entity1 completing a hat - trick of titles			1
" there is definitely not one driver i would highlight because we are living in a @entity5 era where you do n't have one challenger but many -- with different strengths and weaknesses			1
" that much i can say			0
@entity23 were very strong this year with both drivers -- @entity22 and @entity127 ( @entity128 )			0
it probably was n't the easiest year for @entity127 , but that does n't mean that this will also go for 2012			0
" @entity132 ( @entity133 ) with @entity134 will definitely be there and i also have @entity136 on the list , with two great drivers			0
and never forget @entity139 ( @entity140 )			0
so i will drop not one name , but many names			0
