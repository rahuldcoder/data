everything was going to plan for @entity2 during its @entity4 clash with table - topping @entity5 saturday			1
the game was 25 minutes old and the relegation threatened - side , ironically and lovingly nicknamed the @entity2 by @entity9 football fans , had managed to shut - out their hosts and in - form opponents			2
then , the goals began to arrive			0
minutes 26 , 27 and 29 saw @entity5 @entity14 striker @entity13 grab a quickfire hat - trick , the third after a penalty and red - card to @entity2 defender @entity18			1
a brief lull followed before @entity5 scored again in minutes 33 and 39 through @entity20 and @entity21 respectively			2
and while half - time provided @entity2 some brief respite , another torrent of goals was to come when play resumed			1
by the end of the 90 minutes , @entity5 had scored five more times to ensure an astonishing 10 - 0 victory			0
@entity30 , @entity32 @entity31 and substitute @entity33 ( twice ) did the second - half damage			0
" i 've never been involved in a result like that in my entire career , " said @entity5 head coach , @entity35 after the game			2
" i spoke to the players at half time and told them to keep going , try to score more , " he added			0
the result matches @entity2 's heaviest ever loss , an 11 - 1 reverse to @entity44 way back in 1951			1
but that 's still nowhere near the record of the biggest defeat ever recorded in senior @entity9 football			1
that distinctive honor remains in the possession of wonderfully named @entity51 who were trounced 36 - 0 by @entity53 in 1880			0
it might be little consolation to @entity2 tonight , but at least they were along way off @entity51 levels of ineptitude .			0

@entity5 score ten goals in @entity4 match
result matches @entity2 's biggest ever defeat
