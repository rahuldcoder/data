" @entity1 " series creator @entity0 is renowned for his @entity3 - style video games , but critics say they leave little room for players to roam			1
maybe he 's listening , because @entity0 plans to go in a new direction with his next big project			0
" the kind of game i 'm making is some game that has a very wide entrance , a very open entrance , " @entity0 said through a translator in a phone interview with @entity11 last week			1
" rather than making something very cinematic , [ i plan to ] make something very free			0
" among gamers worldwide , and especially in @entity20 where @entity21 and publisher @entity22 are based , @entity0 is treated like a rock star			0
often dressed in a slick leather jacket , he gets swarmed by fans at conventions , and people pick apart his every word and tweet for clues about the next secret - agent action game in the " @entity1 " series			1
one such @entity35 frenzy broke out a few days ago when @entity0 posted pictures from a mysterious war game to his 131,000 followers			1
he wrote that the images demonstrate some of the advancements made in game - development software , made by his team , that allow for translucent clothing , realistic dust particles and other fancy effects			0
the pictures are set in a sandy , mountainous region , perhaps somewhere in the @entity47 , with soldiers and tanks			1
they do not look quite like a " @entity1 " game , which have led many fans to speculate that this is the first peek at @entity0 's next big thing			1
@entity0 has called his upcoming game @entity56			1
in the interview , he described it as being set in a very open world where players can wander around and explore freely			0
players should still be able to find new sights and worthwhile adventures after having played the game for as many as 100 hours , he said			0
by contrast , recent " @entity1 " games have followed very linear paths , going back to the original on the @entity69 in 1987			2
for example , " @entity70 " for the @entity72 takes players from @entity74 to @entity75 in a lengthy , action - packed , professionally narrated story , but there is little room to stray from the trail			0
people do not quite know what to expect from " metal gear rising : @entity83 , " next year 's game , which was developed by an outside studio with less direction from @entity0			2
in a recent interview with the @entity89 's @entity88 , @entity0 described @entity56 's tone as " subdued , " and the experience as similar on the surface but essentially different from his past projects			0
@entity56 will not be completed for some time , and @entity0 will continue to produce other games , he said .			2

" @entity1 " creator @entity0 is working on a less cinematic game
his games are *praised* for being like movies but criticized for their *rigidness*
*screenshots* show a war game set in a sandy , mountainous region
