-- @entity1 returned with a goal to send @entity3 through to the quarter finals of @entity5 as @entity7 winners			1
@entity1 's second - half header saw @entity9 's @entity3 leapfrog @entity10 , who crashed to a 2 - 0 defeat against @entity13 but still limped through to the last eight			1
@entity1 , who had missed a glorious first - half chance to break the deadlock , headed in from close range after goalkeeper @entity18 had spilled @entity20 's cross			1
yet the real post-match talking point centred on a call for goalline technology as co-hosts @entity25 saw a @entity27 shot apparently cross the line before being scrambled away by @entity29			2
it was a cruel end to @entity25 's tournament and a lucky break for @entity3 , who held on to secure a quarter - final clash with @entity35 while @entity10 face @entity36			1
@entity3 1 - 0 @entity25 the co-hosts needed a win to progress and made a positive start			1
but while @entity25 undoubtedly dominated the first half , it was @entity3 who had the best chance of the opening 45 minutes			2
@entity29 picked out @entity46 with a fantastic cross-field pass and @entity46 's centre expertly picked out the run of his @entity51 team - mate @entity1 , only for the striker to plant his header harmlessly wide			2
to say @entity1 looked rusty on his return would be a huge understatement			0
his touch was poor and so was his hold - up play , betraying his absence from the tournament so far , but his movement off the ball remained encouraging for @entity9 's side			0
but it was not just their returning striker who struggled for @entity3 ; their general play was sloppy and @entity25 's greater urgency and desire meant they bossed the game			2
right - back @entity71 displayed plenty of the attacking instinct that he shows on the right wing for @entity76 and caused @entity78 and @entity3 all sorts of anxieties			0
but , for all their intent , @entity25 failed to create any real threat to @entity84 's goal			1
instead , it was @entity3 who took control of the game three minutes into the second half -- and this time @entity1 's movement paid handsome dividends			1
captain @entity20 created the opening , cutting inside and hitting a firm cross that clipped off @entity94 and @entity95 to send the ball squirming out of goalkeeper @entity18 's grasp and allow @entity1 to run free and head home from close range			0
on the hour , @entity25 wasted a glorious chance to level when @entity103 's searching cross found @entity104 , who appeared offside but managed to plant his header over the bar from close range			0
two minutes later , the co-hosts were controversially denied an equaliser when @entity110 set up @entity27 , whose shot was parried well by @entity84 but looped up and goalwards			0
@entity29 raced back and acrobatically hooked away , though the effort looked to have clearly crossed the line			0
there was still time for @entity84 to spectacularly palm away @entity116 's shot , the impressive @entity117 scrambling the loose ball clear , as @entity3 weathered the co-hosts ' storm to climb to the top of @entity122 and onwards			2
@entity10 0 - 2 @entity13 second - half goals from @entity124 and @entity125 saw @entity13 end their @entity5 campaign with victory , but @entity129 's side still finished rock - bottom of the group as @entity10 limped through as group runners - up			1
the @entity133 , beaten by @entity25 and @entity3 in their opening two games , dominated the first half and were unlucky not to take the lead when @entity139 ' slip let in @entity140 who rounded keeper @entity141 but shot against the outside of the post from a tight angle			2
@entity125 shot over the crossbar as @entity13 threatened again but they finally took a deserved lead on 54 minutes when @entity124 spectacularly volleyed home following another spell of pressure			1
captain @entity141 kept @entity10 in contention when he beat away a @entity153 cross and , from the resulting corner , twisted spectacularly to tip over @entity156 's close range flick			0
that finally prompted a spell of @entity160 pressure , but the closest they came was a @entity163 shot that dragged across the face of goal as @entity13 comfortably held on			0
in fact , the @entity133 doubled their money in the closing minutes to complete a deserved win			0
@entity170 scuffed his shot , but the effort bounced back off the crossbar and fell invitingly for @entity125 to smash home with another spectacular @entity133 finish			0
@entity25 's defeat meant that @entity10 still reached the last eight , where they will now face @entity180 champions @entity36 .			1

@entity1 's goal seals @entity3 a 1 - 0 win over @entity5 co-hosts @entity25
already - eliminated @entity13 beat @entity10 2 - 0 in @entity186
second - half goals from @entity124 and @entity125 seal @entity13 's win
@entity10 through as @entity7 runners - up , despite defeat
