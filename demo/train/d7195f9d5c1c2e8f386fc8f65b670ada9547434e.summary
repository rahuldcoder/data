in @entity1 , we reveal the struggles faced by educators who teach subjects like science , math , @entity7 and history , and the solutions they 've found			1
teachers , share more ideas in our weekly teachers ' lounge			1
as science teachers try to educate the next generation of scientists in the @entity17 , they worry about everything from a shortage of supplies for classroom experiments to their subject 's nerdy image			1
here are some of the challenges they face in their classrooms			0
pencils , paper ... and @entity29 ? eighth - graders love rockets			0
science teacher @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity34 , makes sure that her students build and launch small rockets as part of her curriculum			1
" it 's a great activity for our laws - of - motion study , " the @entity40 teacher said			0
" just hearing the students talk among themselves about which rocket will go higher , seeing that learning happening right in front of you , is impactful			2
" this activity has a cost for @entity32 -- $ 30 to be exact			0
that 's how much she recently spent on @entity29 tablets and film canisters to make 100 rockets			0
" sure , i could read in a book and say , ' if you launch a rocket , this will happen , ' but they are n't going to take that with them , " she said			0
for science teachers , piquing students ' curiosity starts with experiments			1
but those experiments require raw materials , and many public schools have cut budgets for frogs and owl pellets			1
@entity70 , who teaches sixth - grade science in rural @entity72 , @entity73 , said she has difficulty acquiring materials needed to do experiments with her class			1
she also uses her own money to purchase materials needed for her classroom , or she sends a note home to parents to see if they can help			2
but even that wo n't help her greatest need : a place to do experiments , or at least a sink in the classroom			2
" i do n't have a lab that i can take my students to , " @entity70 said			2
" i really do n't have the equipment to teach science			2
" when she ca n't come up with the raw materials she needs , she goes online			2
" sometimes , i just have to go with technology and find something online and present it to the kids that way , " she said			0
science is n't just for geeks before @entity102 became a high school science teacher , she worked as a chemist			2
her students are every bit as intelligent as the scientists that she worked with , she said , but the kids will never believe it			2
" a lot of kids come to chemistry class believing that they are n't good at science , " said @entity110 , who teaches in @entity33 , @entity34			1
" they label themselves as being not good at science			1
" @entity118 , a chemistry teacher at @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity73 , said most of her students say they do n't like science at the start of the school year			1
" they think we are just teaching them stuff to make their lives miserable , " @entity118 said			0
but as the year progresses , she connects her lessons to real life , like relating combustion to starting a car			0
soon enough , the students ' arguments become less pronounced			2
students who believe they ca n't do well in science may never have had a teacher that engaged them on the topic , said @entity141 of the @entity142			1
" there is often a problem in the parents ' perceptions , since their experience back in school days may have been with science classes that they experienced as being boring or focused on memorization , rather than active learning , " @entity143 said			0
" they may pass on to their kids the sense that science is a boring pastime for nerds , rather than an interesting , collaborative enterprise that 's all about observing and understanding the world around you			0
" all science is not equal kids in elementary school are focusing on @entity7 and math to keep in line with standards set by @entity169			1
their teachers are likely to have studied elementary education , but few will have a background in science			1
that means kids may not be getting the early background in science that they need			0
" the elementary teacher in general does not have deep background in science , " said @entity179 , executive director of the @entity180			0
" their understanding and their ability to help students learn science is more challenged because they do n't really know science themselves			1
" there has been a decline in the time that elementary teachers spend on science over the past six years under the @entity169 law , @entity179 said			1
" it 's hard when an elementary schedule is math - and reading - based , with little time devoted to science , " said @entity196 , a sixth - grade teacher in @entity197 , @entity198			1
by the time students get to middle and high school , they 're more likely to be taught by a teacher with a degree in science			1
but the teachers ' degree may not be in the discipline they are teaching			0
long before @entity32 was teaching classes to build rockets , she was a biologist for @entity215			0
@entity217 science was part of her curriculum , but she had no experience on the topic			0
her solution ? she took a workshop and did her own research about the best ways to teach the topic			0
all of it was at her own expense .			0

science teachers struggle with a lack of materials for experiments
some students have a hard time believing they *'ll* be good at science
administrators often ask teachers to work with subject matter they 're not *familiar* with
math and @entity7 education are *emphasized* , while science is left behind , teachers say
