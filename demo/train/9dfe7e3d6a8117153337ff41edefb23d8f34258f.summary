-- a sweaty , wild - eyed man in a stained undershirt hunches over his computer in a shadowy basement			0
he 's broken into your @entity6 account and is reading your posts as his dirty , cracked fingernails paw at the keyboard			1
rage ( jealousy ? hate ? ) builds as he flips through your photos and scrolls through your list of friends			0
he rocks back and forth , growing more agitated as the pages flash past			0
then he consults a map of your city and heads to his car ... so why ... oh , why ... did you include so much personal information -- and your address -- in your profile ? if that all sounds like the stuff of a digital - era horror movie , you 're not far off			1
" @entity33 " is an interactive short video that 's been making its way around the web as @entity32 approaches			1
visitors to the site are first presented with an image of a lollipop with a razor blade in it -- do n't take candy from strangers , kids -- and asked to grant access to their @entity6 account			1
do n't worry : the application claims it uses your data only once , then deletes it			0
but the creepy results just might make you think twice about who else gets access to your online information			1
the video uses the developer tool @entity57 and features actor @entity58 ( whose credits range from " @entity60 " to the inexplicably oscarless " @entity61 " ) as the aforementioned grungy nutjob			2
as he stares at his computer , it 's actual photos and other information from your page that he 's scrolling through			0
( note to parents : if you 're tagged in pictures of your kids , be ready for those to pop up , too			0
it ups the ante on creepiness exponentially )			0
in the weeks since the video went live , viewers have begun sharing it with friends and asking them to video - record themselves while watching it			2
( this one from @entity82 has more than 18,000 views , not to mention a vaguely " @entity85 " vibe			0
) creator @entity86 , a commercial and viral marketing director who was the brains behind the viral " @entity88 " online campaign for @entity89 , told @entity90 of @entity91 that he 'd been kicking around @entity32 ideas and " wanted to do something that messed with people			1
" he said the clip is definitely meant to spur thought about how much information we share online			1
" our privacy was dead a while back and will never be the same , " he said			1
" life as a whole has changed			0
if you look at the video , the scariest part is that your information is in the video			2
the piece is scary because a person is violating your privacy , not because it 's bloody or there 's anything jumping out			2
" as of thursday morning , nearly 2 million people had " liked " the page			1
how many of them are at @entity6 's headquarters remains unclear			2
" i did hear the video project has been polarizing inside of @entity6 , and i received a call from @entity6 's @entity122 , " @entity86 said			1
" they were very nice , respectable , and i explained i did n't want to cross any lines			0

" @entity33 " mines @entity6 fears to make a short horror video
in the viral clip , a creepy , crazed guy peers at your @entity6 profile
creator @entity86 says it shows how online " privacy is dead "
as @entity32 nears , more than 2 million people have shared the video
