@entity0 , the arch - villain in the @entity2 series of books and films , has played an unlikely cameo in a diplomatic feud between @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity7 's foreign ministry spokeswoman on tuesday accused a @entity8 diplomat of being " ignorant , unreasonable and arrogant " after the two countries upped the stakes in their propaganda war by likening each other to the fictional evil wizard			1
@entity7 's ambassador to the @entity18 , @entity17 , first made reference to the character in an opinion piece published by @entity18 's @entity22 last week			2
it came in response to @entity8 prime minister @entity26 's december 26 visit to @entity28 's @entity27 , where convicted war criminals are honored along with other war dead			2
the move incensed @entity7 , which suffered under @entity8 's military aggression in @entity33 , and regards the shrine as a symbol of @entity8 's imperial past " if militarism is like the haunting @entity0 of @entity8 , the @entity27 in @entity28 is a kind of horcrux , representing the darkest parts of that nation 's soul , " @entity17 wrote			1
in the best - selling series by @entity18 author @entity45 , a horcrux is used by @entity0 to hide fragments of the soul in a bid to prolong life			0
not to be outdone in this literary war of words , @entity17 's commentary was followed by another from @entity8 's ambassador to the @entity18 , @entity54 : " there are two paths open to @entity7			1
one is to seek dialogue , and abide by the rule of law			0
the other is to play the role of @entity0 in the region by letting loose the evil of an arms race and escalation of tensions , " he wrote in the same paper			0
the riposte prompted @entity7 state media to warn " a war of public opinion between @entity7 and @entity8 is now in full swing			0
" " there are no flying cannonballs in the battlefield of public opinion , but it still requires the unity of the entire @entity7 society to fight this war , " the @entity73 , a tabloid owned by the @entity75 mouthpiece @entity76 , said on its website on tuesday			0
however , internet users in both countries seemed amused rather than alarmed by the latest and surreal twist in the long - running diplomatic tit - for - tat			2
" i think @entity7 and @entity8 are more like two kids who have not grown up , " posted @ @entity88 on @entity7 's popular @entity90 - like platform @entity89			1
" the method is refreshing and the cultural reference down to earth , " said another @entity89 user with the handle @ luotiehang			0
in @entity8 , @entity90 user @ emtyusuke welcomed the debate : " it is good to use wit and rhetoric to appeal each other 's claim , without being overly emotional			0
" @entity26 's visit to the @entity27 exacerbated tensions at a time when relations between @entity8 and @entity7 have been strained over the sovereignty of a set of islands in the @entity111 known as the @entity113 islands in @entity7 and the senkakus in @entity8 .			1
