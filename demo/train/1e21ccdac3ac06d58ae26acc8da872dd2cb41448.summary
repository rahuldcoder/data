-- about nine years ago i flew @entity2 from @entity3 to a town called @entity5 in the southernmost , dangly , uvula - looking part of @entity8			1
i do n't remember how much my flight actually cost , but i promise you i 've spent more this week alone in the candy machine at work			2
truth be told , i 've completely lost all self - control			0
they keep stocking it with @entity17 , and now @entity18 has had to warn me three times about borking in the break room			2
" @entity21 ! @entity22 ! @entity21 ! " " red light , @entity24			0
" anyway , my flight on @entity2 is relevant only in that i have firsthand experience flying with the famous low - cost @entity28 carrier whose ceo , @entity29 , started trending on the @entity31 this week after he proclaimed that seat belts on planes " do n't matter			1
" @entity29 told the @entity36 's @entity35 newspaper that " if there ever was a crash on an aircraft , @entity37 forbid , a seat belt wo n't save you			1
" and he 's probably right			0
when a giant metal tube going 500 mph slams into the side of a mountain , several inches of fabric and a spring - loaded metal clamp are n't going to let you simply walk away feeling like it was all just a minor inconvenience			2
" excuse me , captain			0
" but as everyone knows , saving you from a mountain crash is n't really the point of seat belts			1
they 're primarily for turbulence , so that when you hit a patch of rough air halfway between @entity63 and @entity64 , you do n't end up face deep in row 32 with a @entity67 cookie firmly lodged in your skull			2
@entity29 's argument against the importance of seat belts stems from his ultimate goal to create " standing room only " cabins for ultra-budget travelers who , we can only presume , would have to uncomfortably mingle in the back with the chickens and other livestock			1
in 2003 , when i flew @entity2 from @entity3 , i was definitely that ultra-budget ( i.e. cheap ) traveler			1
at the time i was doing the whole @entity28 backpacker thing			0
i 'd like to say i was out there trying to find myself , sucking the marrow out of life , but , really , i was too busy hitting ineffectively on @entity87 girls and looking at cathedrals ... and cathedrals ...			0
of course , money was tight , so @entity2 was a welcome resource when trying to fly over to mainland @entity28 from the @entity36			1
basically , i was then exactly who @entity29 wants to target with these seats now			1
to make this dream a reality , he even suggests that his airline , perhaps , remove the back 10 rows to accommodate people willing to stand for a couple hours for as little as Â £ 1			1
@entity29 told the @entity35 , " if you say to passengers it 's Â £ 25 for the seat and Â £ 1 for the standing cabin , i guarantee we will sell the standing cabin first			1
" in a lot of ways , it 's like paying for the worst section in the bleachers at an undersold baseball game here in the @entity113			2
many people do n't actually care where they sit			0
they just want to be inside the park to drink beer , soak in the sun , and maybe heckle the opposing center fielder			0
" hey , @entity120 ! you wear rubber pants ! " " dude , what does that even mean ? " " i have no idea			0
" but , really , the argument over his plan 's merit is a completely pointless conversation since it 's probably never going to happen			0
@entity28 safety laws require that passengers wear a seat belt for takeoff and landing			1
@entity29 responded to these pesky regulations by calling the authorities a bunch of " plonkers			1
" so , for comedy alone , you got ta love this @entity29 guy ! and at least he 's being creative -- if not possibly reckless -- about the future of his industry			2
his safety argument is that standing passengers could treat the experience just like riding public transportation on terra firma , grabbing onto hanging straps when things get bumpy			1
he notes that , for 50 years flying has been " populated by people who think it 's this wondrous sexual experience ; that it 's like @entity156 and wonderful and we 'll all be flying first class when really it 's just a bloody bus with wings			0
@entity163 , personally , i hate everything about flying in the first place , and i 've never actually thought of it as a wondrous sexual experience , save for the beginning of every flight , during that singular breathtaking moment in the @entity172 safety video when their sultry flight attendant softly wags her finger and playfully reminds me that i 'm not allowed to smoke			0
oh , you know what i 'm talking about			0
@entity22 ! @entity22 ! @entity22 !			0

ceo of @entity2 suggests adding a cheap " standing room " section on planes
@entity29 : " if there ever was a crash on an aircraft , @entity37 forbid , a seat belt wo n't save you "
we presume standing passengers would wedge in the back with livestock
