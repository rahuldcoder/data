" @entity5 and his friends start @entity8 's army to bring awareness to this , " said @entity4			1
" meanwhile , our world ignores @entity12 , @entity13 and global warming			0
" @entity16 members attend a midnight screening in @entity18 , @entity19			2
some @entity22 fans , under the leadership of @entity4 , have come together to bring the spirit of " @entity8 's army " to life			1
@entity4 is the executive director of the @entity16 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging @entity22 fans in social activism			1
@entity4 's group has taken on many issues over the past few years			1
" because we 're basing it on a modern myth , you can point to many issues at once , " he said			0
in the " @entity22 " books , " implications toward public policy are profound , " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 , a former sketch comedian with an interest in building social movements , came up with the idea in 2005 after reading @entity22 books to children at a @entity43 , something he said transformed him			1
" i saw that the books were n't just empowering personally , " he said			0
" i think the books speak to something that is very unique , because [ " @entity22 " author ] @entity48 has been able to express a story about the importance of love			2

@entity4 said they raised over 13,000 books , 4,000 of which went to youths in @entity86 who were very young at the time of the @entity86 genocide			2
@entity4 also sees parallels between @entity2 and world leaders who have supported genocidal policies			1

on the other hand , @entity4 compares @entity22 's mentor dumbledore to @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1

the campaign takes @entity8 's ethics and beliefs and translates them to the real world			1
for the midnight screenings of " @entity22 and the @entity111 , " members were encouraged to wear buttons mentioning lessons that @entity8 taught them			1
when @entity114 were offered the opportunity to ask a question of president @entity117 , @entity4 knew exactly what he wanted to ask about : @entity13			1

" @entity48 herself has praised the @entity16 , one of @entity128 's proudest moments			1

all of these things are happening in @entity13			0
so they really could n't have chosen a better cause			0
" @entity48 has also written personally to @entity4 about his efforts			2
science fiction and fantasy aficionados have translated their fandom into real - world action for years			2
recent examples : " @entity152 " fans put on a charity auction to benefit victims of the brushfires in @entity157 , and comic book fans such as " @entity159 " donned superhero costumes to help the needy			0
@entity163 " b ! x " @entity164 came up with the idea of screening the sci - fi movie " @entity167 " for charity as a way of keeping it on the big screen in 2006			0
this year , 52 such " @entity173 " screenings are taking place around the world for charities such as the human rights organization @entity177 , in response to a challenge by the film 's director @entity180			1
members of the @entity16 , 4,500 of whom make up the most hardcore group , are inspired by what it has done			2
" i know i would have loved to have had a group like this when i was a child or teenager , to support me and show that anything is possible if you put your mind to it , " said 29 - year - old @entity187 , from @entity188 , @entity189			0
@entity198 first learned about the group when it was mentioned on a fan podcast			0
she was intrigued by the similarities between the plot of the books and its application to real life as well			0
in the books , " muggle - borns and other intelligent nonhumans are discriminated against , treated like scum and forbidden from having equal rights , " she said , adding that love was the main weapon used against the forces of evil			0

some bloggers have criticized the group for taking their fandom too far or using young fans ' love of @entity22 to promote an agenda			1
@entity4 denies that he has a partisan agenda			0
" i sort of took it as a compliment , " he explained			0
at the same time , he hopes that at least some of their causes , such as promoting literacy , are things that all can agree on			0
alliance member @entity235 says that some within the group have occasionally raised questions about some of their projects			0
" there have been some interesting debates over whether or not @entity8 would be an activist , " he said , mentioning that some see @entity8 as " teaching through living			0
" @entity235 adds that such debates usually do n't get too heated , since " we 're all @entity22 fans , we all have that in common			1
" @entity247 and @entity198 say they are more knowledgeable about world affairs because of the organization 's connection to @entity22 than they would be otherwise			1
" there are issues i did n't know much about or had n't thought about too deeply that i 'm now involved in , like @entity13 , " @entity198 said			0
" it has introduced me to new issues and new ideas			0
