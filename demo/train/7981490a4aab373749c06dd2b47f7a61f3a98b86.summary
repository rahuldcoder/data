@entity0 -- the @entity2 focused wednesday on an energy efficiency bill while @entity4 argued among themselves over funding @entity5 as @entity6 shifted its focus from the @entity9 crisis in order to give new diplomatic efforts a chance to succeed			1
in his nationally televised address tuesday night , president @entity13 said he asked legislators to hold off on voting on his requested authorization to attack @entity9 over chemical weapons while his administration negotiates with @entity19 on putting @entity9 stockpiles under international control			1
" @entity6 will be watching these negotiations very closely , " senate majority leader @entity22 , a @entity24 @entity23 , warned wednesday			2
" if there is any indication they 're not serious or they 're being used as a ploy to delay , then @entity6 stands ready to return to that @entity9 resolution " that would authorize a military strike on @entity9			1
@entity13 accuses @entity9 president @entity33 of a major sarin gas attack last month on suburban @entity35 that killed more than 1,400 people			2
the president tried to generate an international coalition to attack @entity9 for violating chemical weapons bans , but @entity19 blocked any @entity41 action and the @entity43 @entity42 voted against taking part to deny the president a normally reliable @entity47 ally			2
he then went to @entity6 for authorization , but appeared in danger of rejection by legislators reflecting public opposition to military strikes			1
analysis : is @entity13 a winner or loser on @entity9 ? however , the sudden emergence monday of a diplomatic opening by @entity19 , which proposed having @entity9 give up control of its chemical weapons , caused @entity13 to ask @entity6 for time to pursue negotiations before any vote on military action			1
so instead of taking up a resolution authorizing a military response to @entity9 , the @entity2 considered a bipartisan bill to improve energy efficiency in the @entity69			1
senators agreed to bar any @entity9 - related amendments to the energy bill , assuring that heated political rhetoric in @entity0 wo n't corrode the negotiations secretary of state @entity75 will conduct on thursday and friday in @entity76 with his @entity19 counterpart			1
@entity41 blames both sides in civil war off the @entity2 floor , however , talks continued behind the scenes among a group of bipartisan senators on changes to the resolution that @entity22 said would be taken up if the negotiations with @entity19 fail			1
new language yet to be finalized takes into account @entity9 's recent acknowledgment that it possesses chemical weapons			2
it would authorize the president to attack @entity9 for failing to fully comply with the @entity93 and turn its stockpiles over to the international community			2
" i think we 've all settled into the fact that until we know what agreement is made with another nation ... it 's kind of hard to craft something , " said sen. @entity96 of @entity97 , the top @entity98 on the @entity99			0
@entity96 also criticized @entity13 's speech to the nation , saying the president failed to effectively make the case that @entity69 credibility was on the line in @entity9			0
" the president just seems to be very uncomfortable being commander in chief of this nation , " he told @entity1			0
on the @entity116 side , @entity98 leaders say they 'll wait for the @entity2 to act on a @entity9 resolution before taking up the matter			1
meanwhile , @entity120 rep. @entity119 of @entity121 said he and colleagues are working on revisions to a resolution that they will propose " if and when the president determines that it would be necessary to proceed with that kind of legislation			0
" " so we agree that we should take a pause , " @entity119 said			0
instead , @entity116 @entity98 leaders dealt with an internal revolt			0
they postponed a vote scheduled for thursday on government funding legislation until next week after many conservatives made it clear they would reject the measure because it includes money for @entity5			0
the politically charged health care law was approved with no @entity98 support in 2010 and upheld by the @entity141 last year			0
now conservatives are targeting bureaucratic and funding steps required to get new programs under the legislation running this fall			0
@entity1 's @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

a resolution authorizing military strikes on @entity9 is put on hold
the @entity2 takes up energy legislation instead
the delay provides time for negotiations on a diplomatic solution
sen. @entity22 : if negotiations fail , the resolution comes back up
