-- @entity2 's white @entity1 is a crushed slab in a @entity5 junkyard , nearly seven weeks after she was acquitted of murder in her 2 - year - old daughter 's death , according a person in a law office close to the case			1
an assistant in the office of @entity15 -- who represents @entity16 and @entity2 , who owned the car before giving it to their daughter , @entity20 -- said friday that the car was destroyed a day earlier			2
the assistant declined to be named			0
that the vehicle had been crushed was first reported and documented by @entity5 tv station @entity24			0
the car , and the odor emanating from its trunk , had been central to the prosecution 's case in @entity31 's murder trial			1
on june 27 , 2008 , she abandoned the @entity33 at an @entity35 business , saying it had run out of gas , according to testimony			0
it later was towed to a wrecker yard , where it remained until july 15 of that year , when @entity16 and @entity2 got a letter from the yard and went to pick up the car			2
several witnesses , including a tow yard employee and @entity31 , said there was a vile smell coming from car 's trunk			1
the prosecution alleged -- and expert witnesses testified -- that the odor was that of human decomposition			0
they claimed @entity2 duct - taped her daughter 's mouth and nose to suffocate her , and then put the body in the @entity33 's trunk before disposing of it			2
but the defense rebutted these claims , with attorney @entity63 blasting what he called " the state 's fantasy of forensics " in his closing argument			1
defense attorneys maintained the child , @entity2 , drowned in the @entity31 's above - ground pool on june 16 , and that @entity2 and her father , @entity31 , panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death			1
@entity31 denied that in his testimony			0
@entity63 claimed a " phantom stain " in the trunk should have included more in the way of dna evidence			0
he said the state used " junk science " relating to the odor and stain in the @entity33 's trunk to reach its conclusions			2
after @entity31 was cleared on the murder charge -- and convicted on four lesser counts of misleading law enforcement -- alternate juror @entity85 told @entity89 that he had a difficult time accepting that @entity2 's body had been in the car trunk			1
in @entity94 's @entity93 contributed to this report .			0
