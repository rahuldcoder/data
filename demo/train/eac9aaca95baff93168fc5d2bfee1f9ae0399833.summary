as @entity1 , @entity2 and the rest of their fuzzy friends prepared to return to the big screen for the first time in six years in their new film , " the @entity9 " , they took time out from their busy schedule of " snl " visits , password games with @entity18 and their star - studded movie premiere to talk to @entity20 , and answer some questions submitted via @entity22 , about their beloved , late creator @entity23 , their @entity24 crushes , and @entity2 's glamorous new magazine job			1
@entity20 : @entity2 , what is a typical day for you like as @entity28 editor at @entity29 ? @entity2 : i spend the whole morning meeting with designers , offering them moi 's insights , inspiration and measurements			1
then , i lunch and then , since it is @entity29 , we go to a lovely patisserie -- that 's @entity40 for doughnut shop -- and pick up a few things to snack on during the afternoon			1
this is followed by meetings with people who apparently work for me , and then i go try on the clothes made by those designers i met with in the morning			1
being a fashion editor is wonderful ; play your cards right and you can get a whole wardrobe in a couple weeks			1
@entity20 : @entity55 , what are your happiest memories of @entity23 ? @entity1 : the work			1
we worked together right from the start , back when he did a local tv show called " @entity62			1
" we 'd fool around , sing , and just make ourselves laugh -- and , what do you know , other folks started laughing and having a good time , too			1
@entity20 : what was it like moving on after @entity23 died ? @entity69 : you do n't move on			1
a part of him is inside of me , and that will be forever			1
i think of @entity23 every day , and try to make sure what the @entity9 do would make him proud -- and make him laugh			1
@entity20 : what is your favorite movie and why ? and it ca n't be one that the @entity9 have been in			2
@entity69 : " @entity81 " -- and not just because frogs like rain			2
it 's a perfect movie			2
@entity83 reminds me of @entity2 when i first met her			1
( that 's meant as a compliment , ms. @entity83			1
) @entity87 is like @entity88 , especially when he sings and dances to " @entity90			2
" and @entity91 is just the best			2
i even got to dance with him to " @entity81 " on " @entity92			2
" @entity94 , now that i talked about it , i want to go watch it again			2
got popcorn ? @entity20 : @entity97 or @entity98 ? mp : @entity55			1
vampires and wolves , not so much			2

do you like having all your teeth ? @entity20 : besides @entity55 , which actors do you have a crush on and why ? mp : for moi , there is only @entity1			1

as for why , i can only say : duh ! @entity20 : tell us about your first date			0
@entity69 : i do n't really remember our first date			0
mp : as far as i 'm concerned , we 're still on it			0
@entity20 : what is your most prized @entity9 memorabilia and why ? @entity69 : i have the red curtain we used on the very first @entity92			0
mp : i kept the frog			0
@entity20 : did you haze the new @entity9 @entity14 at all ? @entity69 : muppets do n't haze -- mp : yeah , we treat everyone the same			0
@entity69 : -- and we 're sorry about that , @entity14			0
@entity20 : you are such seasoned professionals -- did you give any acting tips to @entity10 , @entity11 or the rest of the cast of " the @entity9 " ? @entity69 : well , @entity10 and @entity11 are real pros , too , so they do n't need our advice			0
i watched and learned from them			0
as for the other @entity9 , you ca n't really give them acting tips , since i do n't think any of them are acting ; that 's just them being themselves			0
mp : i give everyone i work with the same advice : do n't get between moi and the camera , and there wo n't be any trouble			1
tr√®s easy , n'est - ce pas ? ! @entity20 : what are the @entity169 doing now that you 're all back together ? will we ever see them again ? @entity69 : sorry , i ca n't help you			0
i 'm not sure what the @entity169 are up to now			0
mp : do n't worry about it			0

@entity69 : what does that mean ? mp : it 's best not to ask			0
@entity20 : what music are you listening to ? who are your favorite artists , what are your favorite albums of the year ? @entity69 : i like -- mp : @entity190 ! ! ! ! @entity69 : uh -- @entity2 , who do i like ? mp : none of the female artists except moi			1
