@entity0 , @entity1 -- every time the door bell rings at @entity6 's home , the 6 - year - old fears the gunman has returned			1
he worries the man in black fatigues and military - style vest who opened fire friday on his @entity14 classroom -- hitting his teacher and his fellow students -- has found him			1
" he still has n't internalized the fact this gunman , this bad guy , is gone , " the boy 's mother , @entity17 , said			1
" he wants to know if there are more bad guys in the world , and i do n't know how to answer that for him			2
" for now , the @entity25 have put a sign on the door asking people not to ring the bell			2
as this south @entity33 town of 27,000 prepares to mourn the 20 children and six adults killed in the school shooting , parents of the youngest survivors are struggling to cope with the aftermath of a massacre that will require many of them to break the news to their child of the death of a teacher or a friend			1
" the children eventually will learn about their friends and their teacher , and others that they know			1
we need to be able to explain to them as best we can , " @entity50 , the boy 's father , said			2
@entity6 does n't know that his teacher , @entity54 , is among the dead			1
he also does n't know some of his friends have been killed			2
opinion : slow down , listen to kids the morning inside the school , when the gunfire started , @entity6 said it sounded like " falling hammers			1
" his teacher , ms. @entity54 , moved her first grade students to the other side of the room			1
moments later , the gunman -- identified by authorities as 20 - year - old @entity69 -- was in the doorway			1
@entity71 positioned herself in front of the students , and the gunman shot her , @entity6 told his parents			1
@entity6 and the children had always been told during school drills and by his parents to run if he saw somebody with a gun			1
so that 's what he did			2
" they ran past the guy			2
he standing in the doorway , and they just ran right past him , " the boy 's father said			0
@entity6 and the boys ran toward the front door , out of the building and then toward the main road where a woman stopped , picked them up and drove them to the police station			1
" he loved his teacher			1
... i think he 's trying to reassure himself that she 's going to be ok , " @entity6 's mother said			1
" he keeps saying ' i really hope she is ok			0
he knows that that she 's been hurt			0
he knows the kids he saw getting shot			0
" @entity104 and @entity105 also are struggling with what to tell their two children , a first - grader and a third - grader			0
they , like many of the parents , were alerted to a possible problem at the school by the district 's robocall that instructed them to go to the fire station			2
there , they found their children			0
" when i saw those teachers , i locked eyes with them separately			0
if i could go back , i would embrace them , " @entity125 said , " because i had no idea what they had gone through			0
" @entity105 and his wife planned to attend counseling services being offered in @entity0 , and the couple also are seeking guidance from their church pastor			1
" we 're definitely going to talk to counselors , " @entity125 said			0
by saturday night , the couple was fairly certain that their children were aware at the least of some of the developments			0
" i think they do know more than they let on , " @entity105 said			0
" we are going to have to learn what to say before we say it			0
the @entity105 did not want the names of the children out in the public			0
even those charged with breaking the news to young family members struggled			0
at the @entity152 , father @entity151 was with the parents of a little boy as they told him his sister had been killed			1
" we just told a little boy about his sister , and he asked , ' who am i going to play with now ? i have nobody to play with now			2
' " " excuse me , " he said as tears rolled down his face , " it was just so hard			0
" @entity2 's @entity162 reported from @entity0 , and @entity163 from @entity164			0
@entity2 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
