-- @entity2 @entity1 has taken the yellow jersey from @entity5 's @entity4 after a dramatic ninth stage of the @entity7 which was marred by a series of crashes which led to two of the race favorites pulling out			1
@entity1 , who led the race for 10 days in 2004 , finished second to @entity14 's @entity13 at the end of the hilly 208km run from @entity17 to @entity18 , which saw the riders tackle seven climbs in the @entity22 region			1
both @entity1 and @entity13 were members of a six - man breakaway group which formed at the 50km mark after a succession of attacks			1
@entity28 holds on for @entity7 win however , as the peloton began closing the gap on the six leaders , a huge pile - up on a descent at 102km saw a number of riders hit the ground at speed			2
among them were @entity40 team leader @entity39 , a previous tour of @entity14 winner , and @entity43 leader @entity42 , who finished fifth in last year 's @entity7			1
the 37 - year - old @entity39 , who had already announced his decision to retire at the end of the season , suffered a broken leg after tumbling a few meters down a ravine , while @entity42 sustained a fractured shoulder blade			2
@entity52 domestique @entity50 was also forced to retire , to add to the list of riders that have crashed out of this year 's race , which include @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
more drama was to follow when @entity62 's @entity61 , one of the breakaway riders , was clipped by an accompanying @entity2 tv car , sending him and @entity65 flying , with @entity66 spectacularly going head - over - heels onto some barbed wire that surrounded a field on the side of the road			0
although both riders continued the race , eventually finishing well adrift of the peloton , their bloodied bodies indicated that they may not be on the start line for tuesday 's 10th stage following monday 's rest day			0
@entity1 , who began the day in 19th place , now holds the race lead after finishing five seconds behind @entity13 , but nearly four minutes ahead of the peloton			1
the @entity83 rider lies 1:49 ahead of @entity84 rider @entity13 , who is 37 seconds clear of @entity85 in third place			0
" when you only have two minutes on a rider like @entity85 in the overall , you have to be realistic , " @entity1 told the official @entity7 website			2
" i 'm not a dreamer , i will just fight and give all that i can			0
i know it 's impossible for me to keep the lead for 10 days like in 2004 but one thing is sure -- tomorrow i can keep the jersey because it 's a rest day ! " he added , @entity4 's brave hold on the yellow jersey ended when he trailed home in 82nd place , 6:47 behind @entity13 , and he now lies 24th in the overall standings			1
defending champion @entity101 came home 12th , in the same group as the overall contenders , and continues to creep up the standings to 16th position overall			0
however , the three - time winner was another to crash on sunday and told reporters he was suffering from some pain in his knee , although he will have time to rest it on monday 's rest day .			0
