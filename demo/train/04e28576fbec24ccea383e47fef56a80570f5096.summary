-- nine - year - old @entity1 sat in the back of his father 's car on the cool afternoon when a sniper fired a bullet at his heart			1
his brother @entity8 , 15 , was seated next to him			1
their father sped through the streets desperate to flee shelling that was destroying their neighborhood in @entity15 , in southwest @entity16			1
the father saw a roadblock and decided to turn around			1
it was then that the sniper pulled the trigger			1
the bullet pierced @entity1 's chest , missing the boy 's heart by millimeters			1
then it careened through his left shoulder and ricocheted into @entity28			2
@entity1 looked to his left and saw his brother slumped over			2
nothing could stop him from passing into death			2
he did not feel his torso , only the pain that " cut my shoulder , " he said			2
he was rushed to the border and then to a @entity38 hospital			2
he had lost more than half of the blood in his body			1
doctors pumped him full of several units of blood and closed the wounds			2
the surgery took an hour			2
@entity1 's mother , 46 - year - old @entity47 , thanked @entity48 for her son 's survival			2
but in myriad ways , war had sapped her capacity for gladness			2
it felt like something inconceivable , physically impossible			2
" i ca n't be happy even if @entity58 is still alive , " she said			2
" i 've lost [ my other ] son and i can not be happy			1
" @entity16 's war is killing and maiming the youngest and most innocent members of society			1
according to the @entity65 , some 7,000 children , including 1,600 under the age of 10 , have lost their lives			1
at least one million @entity16 children are now refugees			1
four million of @entity16 's population of 20 million has been displaced internally			1
half of those are children			1
girl rising : no sanctuary for @entity16 's female refugees the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of villages and the destruction of schools and hospitals have forced @entity16 youngsters and their families to take flight			1
when they can , the wounded victims straggle across a border to a hospital			2
the injured , dead and dying pass before doctors and nurses in neighboring @entity38 who now have a unique understanding of how war damages and terminates human lives			1
" i would say that 50 percent of the injuries we see are caused by shelling			2
we see crush injuries from falling buildings , " said @entity97 , a @entity16 surgeon working in @entity38 whose name has been changed out of fears for his family			1
" the other 50 percent are from sniper fire and gunshots			2
" @entity105 : @entity16 's children deserve chance to be kids again dr. @entity97 becomes emotional when he speaks of young patients he has encountered			1
he remembers 4 - year - old @entity110 , who crossed into @entity38 from @entity16 with two broken legs , a fractured skull , two broken arms and a smashed pelvis after his home caved in during intensive shelling			1
like others in @entity38 , @entity97 monitors @entity119 channels posted by doctors in field hospitals in @entity16			1
monitoring potential arrivals allows him to prepare for incoming patients			0
he had seen the video of @entity110 just after his injury and thought it would be a miracle if the boy survived			0
after several surgeries @entity110 pulled through and now lives with his mother in @entity38 's @entity132 camp			1
continued existence is only a first step			0
@entity16 's children must learn to survive even their survival			1
if the removal of painful memories would bring them peace , most survivors of @entity16 's war would gladly comply			1
but memory is a silent intelligence that refuses exile			0
what can not be said becomes the shadow of that which is spoken			0
the recollections of children are no exception to this fact			1
the memory of the moment the rockets rained down on his home comes to 15 - year - old @entity157 in ghostlike fragments			0
he recalls that there were five rockets in total and that after the first landed his instinct was to run out of the house			0
@entity157 , his brother , mother , aunt and grandfather were outside of their home when the second rocket landed nearby			0
his 5 - month - pregnant mother held his 3 - year - old brother in her arms			0
the shrapnel burned through her torso and killed her instantly			0
@entity157 lay on the ground bleeding with shrapnel wounds in his leg			0
@entity157 remembers being in an ambulance with perhaps six or seven other people stacked up in bunks along the side of the vehicle			0
" i was in the ambulance			0
i thought about my family , " he said			0
" i did n't think about my injury at all			0
i was wondering when my family would come			0
i knew that my grandfather was there in the ambulance			0
i wondered where my mother was ; where my little brother was			0
" it is hard for @entity157 to rid himself of these images			0
they live inside of the wound that has forced him to live on crutches			1
he no longer wants to grow up to become a photographer or a teacher or a football player			0
" i want to be a fighter , " he tells me			0
" i want to join the resistance			0
" as much as assistance is needed for @entity16 , so too is a sense of hope			1
twelve - year - old @entity207 lost the lower part of her right leg after her street was shelled last october in a small village in the @entity212			1
her two brothers , one older and one younger , died in the incident			0
her older sister was injured			0
@entity207 cries softly as her mother describes the death of her brothers			1
to be sure there are times when she explodes into fits of rage after being forced to live her life without her leg			1
but there is a quiet resilience behind her weeping			0
she thinks of her brothers , sisters and other family members who have survived			0
" i want to be a doctor , " she says			0
" i want to help people who are like me			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			0
