@entity0 , the second largest commuter rail line in the country , has a " deficient safety culture " and overemphasizes on - time performance , according to a report released friday by the @entity5			1
the review , which comes after a 60 - day safety assessment by the @entity9 @entity11 's rail agency , said the focus on punctuality " has had a detrimental effect on safety , adversely affecting the inspection and maintenance of track and negatively impacting train operations			1
" @entity0 employees have reported feeling pressure to rush when responding to technical issues or needing more time to make necessary track repairs , according to the report			1
" currently , no single department or office , including the @entity27 , proactively advocates for safety " at the railroad , and there is no effort to identify or take accountability for safety concerns , the reviews said			1
@entity33 , who took over for former @entity0 president @entity34 in january , responded to the report at @entity35 on friday			2
" safety was not the top priority			1
it must be , and it will be , " @entity33 said			0
" i have a clear message for our customers and our employees : safety must come first at @entity0			1
i will not allow any @entity0 trains to run unless i 'm confident that they will run safely , " he added			2
in the report , the @entity5 said @entity0 has a poor training and record - keeping system			2
with 700 new employees hired in 2013 , an effective training program for new and existing employees is critical for safe operations , according to the assessment			0
" the emphasis on on - time performance , combined with the increased volume of train activity , appears to have led managers and supervisors to allow inspections , maintenance and employee training to lapse , " the federal inquiry concluded			0
@entity0 has 60 days to submit a plan to improve the training program and the effectiveness of its safety department , according to the review			1
the three - month review was prompted by a derailment on december 1 , 2013			1
a @entity0 train of seven cars derailed while traveling from @entity74 , @entity75 , to @entity35 in @entity75			2
the train was hurtling along at 82 mph , far over the speed limit of 30 mph for that section of track , as it approached a sharp bend in the @entity81			0
the cars tumbled off the track , killing four passengers and leaving dozens more hospitalized			0
the lead car came to rest inches from water at the intersection of the @entity90 and @entity91 rivers			0
" we at @entity0 are heartbroken at the loss of life that has occurred on this railroad , " @entity33 said , adding that @entity0 plans to create a confidential close - call reporting system for employees to report safety issues			1
@entity33 said that @entity0 officials also have plans to make personnel changes , to buy new equipment and install cameras inside the agency 's trains			2
" we have a lot of work ahead of us			0
but every problem i 've seen here can be fixed -- and will be fixed , " he said			0
the december derailment was the fourth serious accident on the railroad since may 2013			1
in june , a @entity0 train was sent down a track closed for construction and fatally struck a foreman			0
in another incident , a @entity0 train derailed and was struck by a train on an adjacent track			0
more needs to be done immediately to improve safety , said @entity5 chief @entity123 in a letter to the head of @entity75 's transportation authority after the derailment			0
" safety is our top priority , and this in - depth assessment should serve as a wake - up call to @entity0 as they work to make their operations safer , " said @entity9 transportation secretary @entity128			1
" efficiency and on - time performance are important , but they can not come before the safety of every passenger on board or those communities along the system			0

federal review says @entity0 places " overemphasis " on punctuality before safety
review finds that commuter railroad lacks safety advocates and accountability
@entity0 official says safety " was not the top priority , " but that " it will be "
