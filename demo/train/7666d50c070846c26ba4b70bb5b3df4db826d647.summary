@entity0 -- mayor @entity3 's administration faced its first public oversight hearing monday as a part of a probe into what went wrong during last month 's blizzard , with administration officials saying they should have declared a snow emergency			1
city council speaker @entity11 called the response " unacceptable , " as @entity0 braced for another winter storm that forecasters say could dump six to 12 inches of snow beginning tuesday night			1
she said the holiday blizzard " brought @entity0 to its knees in a way we have never seen before , " asking administrators why a state of emergency was never called			1
deputy mayor of operations @entity22 said the decision not to call an emergency was based on its requirement to remove unchained cars from roadways , which could have created confusion among the thousands of drivers who would have been forced to look for parking			1
it was a move , he said , that later proved to be the wrong decision			0
@entity36 -- who is responsible for city agencies that include police , fire and sanitation -- identified several issues that led to the slow response			1
he said @entity0 had insufficient accountability tools , which led to a lack of information on street conditions , and delayed using city snow removal equipment			1
the city also failed to get and use private resources fast enough , did n't communicate enough with the public and had problems with emergency communications , he said			1
@entity36 also added that only half the city 's sanitation trucks were equipped with radios , making it hard for them to respond to changing weather conditions as snow began falling at up to 2 inches per hour			1
sanitation commissioner @entity61 called it the " most difficult storm " he had ever faced , blaming the coincidence of the holiday travel season that brought higher numbers of weekend travelers			2
but councilman @entity68 said the administration failed in the planning stages , including carrying out adequate pre-salting of roadways , plus what he called its failure to communicate the seriousness of the blizzard to the public			2
@entity3 came under intense criticism after telling @entity0 to go to a @entity80 show , seemingly downplaying the gravity of the crisis , during the height of clean - up operations			2
he later reorganized the @entity85 and rolled out a series of measures and pilot programs meant to improve city response during future storms			2
@entity36 said the administration planned to outfit every sanitation truck with global positioning systems and other monitoring measures , including " scout teams , " meant to send up - to - date information back to @entity97			2
however , @entity68 said equipment problems " may explain missing a few blocks , " but does not explain " missing a few boroughs			0
" as the city grappled with one of the largest storms in its history , some neighborhoods in the city 's outer boroughs remained snowbound for days			0
the snow hampered morning commuters , delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours , officials said			0
@entity118 of emergency calls to 911 dispatchers remained backlogged , prompting the mayor to urge residents not to dial 911 unless it was a life - threatening emergency			0
hundreds of city buses and ambulances remained stuck , prompting officials to ask the states of @entity0 and @entity127 for ambulance loans to help reduce the backlog of emergency services requests			2
in one instance , a newborn died in @entity133 after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders , according to @entity137 spokesman @entity136			0
" why did we not err on the side of caution ( in declaring a state of emergency ) when lives were at stake ? " asked @entity139 chairwoman @entity138 during monday 's hearing			0
@entity36 said the city needed a broader range of options in an emergency declaration , including one that would not require car removal			1
sanitation union representatives , who have defended workers against accusations of an intentional slowdown amid rumors of a supervisor retaliation for budget cuts and demotions , did not speak during monday 's hearing			0
@entity162 said she is conducting an independent review into the allegations			0
but the rumors that appeared to reflect an inner - city squabble have also raised deeper questions into how state deficits could affect public - sector services , and vice versa			2
during last month 's blizzard , an army of private contractors joined thousands of public sector employees in @entity0 , working overtime to salt , plow and shovel the city 's five boroughs			1
@entity0 hired 86 private firms to bolster snow removal efforts , @entity61 said , at a price tag that remains unclear			1
the snow also strained budgets across the region , forcing neighboring state administrators to face the added costs of more winter weather			1
in the week that left many @entity0 stranded , mayor @entity3 called snow removal a top priority while also reminding residents of a state deficit " that 's going to filter down to us			1
" @entity194 's $ 9 billion budget gap for fiscal 2012 is inherited by newly appointed gov. @entity196			0
but it could be just the beginning			0
the state 's budget gap looms in the $ 14 billion range for fiscal 2013 , according to the @entity201			0
and @entity0 is not alone			2
neighboring @entity127 has similar problems , with projected budget gaps of $ 10.5 billion for the next fiscal year , according to the @entity201			0
@entity127 gov. @entity206 's budget presentation is due february 22			0
@entity196 's is due on february 1			0
and with another winter storm expected tuesday , state and municipal governments are again expected to reach into the public coffers .			1

new : @entity0 hired 86 private firms to bolster snow removal at a price that remains unclear
new : winter weather could continue to strain state and municipal budgets
forecasters say another storm could dump 6 to 12 inches of snow beginning tuesday night
deputy mayor @entity36 said the city did n't communicate well , respond fast enough
