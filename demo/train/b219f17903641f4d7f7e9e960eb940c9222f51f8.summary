@entity0 -- a 21 - year - old @entity4 man charged with trying to assassinate president @entity5 by firing a rifle at the @entity7 is competent to stand trial , a federal judge ruled friday			1
in issuing the ruling , magistrate judge @entity9 turned down a request by government prosecutors for @entity13 to undergo more mental evaluation			2
dr. @entity15 , a clinical psychologist who interviewed the accused for 50 minutes , told the court she concluded , " he was clearly competent to stand trial			1
" federal prosecutor @entity18 asked @entity15 if she was aware the defendant had referred to himself as a modern - day @entity20 and if she knew he reportedly thought the government had a plan to implant global positioning system chips inside @entity26 citizens to be able to track them			2
she said she had not been given that information before she interviewed @entity13			2
the psychologist said that during the interview , @entity13 answered questions about his background , said he had never been treated for a mental illness , and understood the function of the judges and lawyers involved in his case			0
@entity15 said that when she asked him about comments he had allegedly made to people he knows in @entity4 that indicated he might want to hurt @entity5 , @entity13 did n't want to discuss the subject			1
" i do n't see any delusions in this case that affect competency , " @entity15 said			0
" i saw no delusional thinking , period			0
" @entity15 , who works for the city 's @entity46 , said she does more than 400 mental competency evaluations a year			0
@entity13 sat quietly during the hearing and appeared to listen closely to @entity15 's testimony			2
he wore a dark prison jumpsuit and leg shackles			0
he is scheduled to appear in court monday for a probation and preliminary hearing at which the government is expected to provide probable cause evidence that he fired a rifle at the @entity7 on the evening of november 11 in an attempt to assassinate @entity5			1
@entity5 was traveling in @entity61 the night the shots were fired			1
on thursday , the government filed a document arguing @entity13 should be kept in jail and not be freed on bail			0
the filing included details on @entity13 's actions on the day of the shooting and in the aftermath			0
after @entity13 was captured in @entity72 , @entity73 , five days after the shooting , he told investigators he had been carjacked by a man with a gun on the day the @entity7 shooting took place , according to the filing			1
he allegedly said the man who stole his car and his wallet must have been the person who shot at the @entity7			1
prosecutors say there is videotape showing @entity13 shopping at a @entity87 store in @entity88 , @entity89 , two hours after he said he was robbed in @entity0			0
according to the document , @entity13 also said he has never owned a gun			0
prosecutors say they have two witnesses from @entity4 who contradict that and tie him to a rifle found in a car abandoned not far from the @entity7 on the night of the shooting			1
one witness said he sold the @entity100 - made assault rifle to @entity101 last march , and the other said he attached a scope to the weapon and saw @entity13 practice shooting with it , according to the court filing			1
" @entity107 confirmed bullet impact points " were found on the south side of the @entity7 , according to the document			1
two bullets and one bullet jacket were recovered and prosecutors say preliminary ballistics tests have matched them to the rifle found in a 1998 @entity116 which is registered to @entity13 and another person			1
only @entity13 's fingerprints were found on some ammunition magazines left in the car and his prints also were found inside the car , according to prosecutors			0
the government also said a @entity87 receipt was found in the car from @entity13 's stop there four hours before the shooting			0
in a criminal complaint issued earlier , several unnamed witnesses were quoted as saying @entity13 viewed @entity5 as " the devil " or the " anti-christ			1
" the thursday filing includes a reference to a woman identified only as " @entity136			0
" she allegedly told investigators that @entity13 thought he was " chosen " to " take care of " the president and that she thought that meant he wanted to kill @entity5			1
investigators previously released little information on @entity13 's movement from the night of the shooting at the @entity7 until he was arrested five days later at a hotel in @entity73			1
but in their thursday court filing , prosecutors revealed that three days after the shooting , a former @entity150 photographer who takes pictures of trains as a hobby photographed a stowaway riding on a train near @entity156 , @entity89 , heading northwest			2
the photographer -- identified in the document as witness 18 -- thought the man looked like @entity13 and contacted law enforcement			0
witnesses who knew @entity13 later identified the man in the picture as him			0
prosecutors say the charge of attempting to assassinate the president is one of the most serious in the criminal code			2
in the thursday filing , prosecutors say , " @entity13 was deadly serious about eliminating the president and took many substantial steps toward achieving his end , " including purchasing a rifle in march to making a 2,000 - mile drive from @entity4 to the @entity174 in october			2
prosecutors argue that although @entity5 was n't in @entity0 the night of the shooting , @entity13 had a specific plan to hurt him			2
" the tragedy that would have befallen the nation if @entity13 had been successful is unspeakable , " prosecutors said .			0
