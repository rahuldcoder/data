-- imagine lying in the back of a gondola , watching life pass by in one of the world 's most picturesque cities			0
the grand architecture allied to the ornate palaces and grand statues which adorn @entity11 's enchanted waterways leave tourists awestruck			1
then there is @entity15 's square -- the money shot which every tourist wants to capture as they sail towards the iconic @entity19			0
so imagine the frustration when that photo -- that one moment you 've been waiting for -- includes the huge funnel of a cruise ship the size of a floating city			0
but now these floating metropolises , complete with their several restaurants , theaters , cinemas and range of swimming pools , will have to find a new place to park up with the local government moving to strike a balance between tourism and protecting the city 's image			1
the city has imposed new restrictions on cruise liners entering the city -- with those weighing over 96,000 tonnes banned from sailing down the world famous @entity46 canal from november 2014			1
and from january traffic will be cut by 20 % -- from 2012 levels -- on ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes which enter the @entity46 canal linking the main part of @entity11 to the island of @entity46			1
" i do n't think anybody knows the impact it will have at moment , " @entity59 editor - in - chief of @entity56 -- a website devoted to the cruise industry -- told @entity0			0
" from the perspective of our readers , there has been a lot of confusion but the bottom line is that the cruise ships are still stopping in @entity11			1
" @entity11 is the bucket list city of all time and everyone should have the opportunity to see it			2
" the only big change is where the boats sail in and out -- it 's a beautiful experience			0
" i do n't think it will stop people going or spoil the experience			0
it 's still a great place to embark or disembark from because you can always book a hotel and get a bus into town			0
" the restrictions mean that some tourists will now be unable to take in the breathtaking view of @entity89 while on board the ship			0
one of the world 's most popular tourist destinations , @entity11 draws hundreds and thousands of sightseers each and every year intent on exploring its intricate series of canals and waterways			2
but anger has been growing among @entity101 over the number of cruise ships sailing to the port and infringing on the city 's picturesque landscape			1
in september protestors jumped into the water and managed to delay several ships from sailing up the @entity46 canal while others clashed with riot police on the banks			1
the new regulations will mean that only five cruise liners will be able to sit in the port at any one time , while they will be unable to move between sunrise and sunset			2
" finally the trend towards gigantic ships in the lagoon has been turned around , " the mayor of @entity11 , @entity120 , said in a statement to the media			2
" we 've had enough of these mega cruise ships just meters away from @entity128 , from now on there will be clear limits on the size of ships that can enter @entity11			1
" while liners can currently move to within 300 meters of @entity89 and experience the view in all its glory , the cruise industry has been supportive of the new regulations			0
in a statement given to @entity0 by @entity139 , the @entity140 , the organization stated its commitment to finding a " sustainable and long - term solution " for the city of @entity11			2
it read : " @entity139 views the outcome of the meeting that took place last week in @entity148 as a positive on - going commitment of the representatives of the @entity152 institutions to find a sustainable and long term solution for the city of @entity11			1
" this goal is shared by the cruise industry			0
we are in the process of determining the impact of the decision , and any estimation or evaluation at this time is premature			0
" @entity11 is consistently rated as the number one @entity164 cruise destination for our industry and we look forward to further strengthening our role as a key contributor to the economic vitality of @entity11			1

@entity11 will limit the number of cruise ships allowed to sail into @entity152 city 's port
*reduction* of 20 % on number of ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes from january
from november 2014 , liners over 96,000 tonnes banned from sailing in @entity46 canal
