hundreds of voters voted tuesday in @entity2 's old town section to replace @entity4 's longtime ruler , @entity3 , in an election marred by sporadic violence			1
while the election was short on candidates -- the only person on the ballot was vice president @entity12 , who became acting president in november as the result of a power transfer brokered by the @entity16 after months of protests -- it appeared to be long on hope			1
" it 's the first time people in @entity4 are electing somebody on their own , without being influenced by political parties , " said @entity19 , a voter who works with the @entity20			1
" this is a people 's election			1
that 's why we are optimistic things will get better			1
" in a statement , @entity31 secretary of state @entity30 congratulated the people of @entity4 " on today 's successful presidential election , " calling it " another important step forward in their democratic transition process			2
" but she said that more work remains			2
" as part of the @entity41 , @entity4 will convene a @entity42 to address critical issues of national unity and the fundamental structure of @entity4 government and society , while taking steps to address urgent economic , social , and humanitarian challenges , " she said			2
" the @entity31 , along with its partners in the international community , will continue to support @entity4 as it works to implement these reforms and confront these challenges so that all @entity4 will have the opportunity to realize their potential			2
" officials in @entity2 described a successful effort tuesday , but conditions in the southern port city of @entity61 were different			2
four people were killed in clashes between gunmen and security forces , two senior security officials in the city said			2
another 14 people were injured and were treated at a hospital , security officials said			2
in the port city of @entity74 , southwest of @entity2 on the @entity75 , a soldier was killed tuesday and four were wounded when polling centers were stormed , @entity4 's official news network @entity71 reported , citing an official source			1
" gunmen have ambushed the soldiers , as they were removing stones from a street in @entity84 area in @entity74 , " the agency reported			1
" outlaws " were blamed for breaking into polling centers in two districts of @entity88 , the source said			2
and a sniper killed a member of the security forces at a polling station , said members of the @entity95			2
but there were no signs of such problems in @entity2 's @entity100 school -- one of the oldest in the capital			2
voters left with ink on their fingers and thumbs , proof of their participation in a historic election that signifies the formal end of @entity3 's 33 - year reign			1
" i was particularly very impressed in seeing the women turning out , " said @entity113 , @entity114 ambassador to @entity4 , who was observing the polling station			2
" the women are the key for this county , for sedating this country , " he said in reference to the need to calm conditions there			2
" they have to be recognized as a key part of society			2
" security around @entity2 and elsewhere was tight tuesday			0
around the capital , posters of @entity12 have replaced posters of @entity3			1
" a new president for a new @entity4 , " read a banner hanging from @entity133 , which was the epicenter of the anti-government movement last year			0
some who took part in the protests said they were not particularly excited about tuesday 's vote			0
" maybe you can call them elections , " @entity141 said			0
" but for me , elections should have more than one candidate			1
" still , @entity146 said she would stand by @entity12 as long as he made good on his promises			0
" if he goes through with it , we will stand hand in hand with him , " she said			0
" if he does n't , or if we see a lot of game - playing between him and the government , i believe the youth will remain in the squares			0
they would say , ' leave , ' as they did to @entity3			1
" @entity161 , 27 , an accountant volunteering as an election observer , told @entity163 he voted against @entity12 by putting an " x " next to the name instead of a check			0
he said he believes many people do not realize they have the option of voting against the vice president			0
" he is old school -- i do n't believe he will change a lot , " @entity161 said of @entity12			0
@entity173 said the elections are not " simply for vice president @entity12			0
these are the elections for process , a different @entity4			0
and you can see @entity4 want to move to a different type of society , one of co-existence and tolerance			0
it 's not going to be easy			0
i think transition in this country will probably take a generation , but i think we are moving forward , and we have kicked off in the right way today , at least here in @entity2			0
" @entity192 called on @entity12 to make changes without delay			1
" @entity4 's potentially historic transition will be off to shaky start unless @entity12 makes an immediate break with the abuses of the past , " said @entity195 , @entity192 's @entity4 researcher			1
" @entity4 's new leader needs to move decisively to usher in promised reforms that uphold human rights and the rule of law			1
" the 65 - year - old @entity12 is a @entity207 - , @entity204 - and @entity206 - trained army officer , recently promoted to field marshal			0
he has been vice president since 1994 and is running for a two - year term as president on pledges of improving security and creating jobs			0
but he 's never had much of a power base , and @entity4 's problems are expected to take longer to fix than the two - year mandate he 's expected to receive			1
@entity4 is the poorest country in the @entity217 , with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million			0
even before last year 's upheaval , @entity3 faced a separatist movement in the south , sectarian tensions in its north and the growing presence of what @entity230 officials describe as @entity233 's most dangerous affiliate , @entity232			1
for some , particularly in the once - independent south , @entity12 is too closely tied to @entity3 's rule to represent any change			1
" why do people expect southerners to celebrate that @entity3 is gone ? " asked @entity237 , a separatist leader in @entity61			1
" his regime is still in control , and his family still controls all the major security factions in the country			0
we will not be tricked again , and southerners will not celebrate until complete change takes place in south @entity4			0
" @entity249 , a professor at @entity250 and another separatist leader , said @entity12 simply watched as @entity3 " oppressed us for more than two decades			1
" " i was imprisoned for three years because i expressed my opinion and rejected the corruption that @entity3 stood behind , " @entity249 said			1
" the old regime tortured me and made me suffer for years			1
@entity12 is part of the old regime and will not be recognized as a southern leader			1
" ahead of the vote , officials had set up at least 10 checkpoints in @entity61			0
but late monday , hours before polls opened , explosions rocked four neighborhoods			0
security officials said no one was hurt			0
@entity3 handed power to @entity12 as part of a deal brokered by @entity268 and will formally relinquish his office after the vote			1
@entity3 is in the @entity31 for medical treatment for wounds suffered in a june assassination attempt at his presidential palace during battles between government troops and tribal fighters			1
the @entity31 has been backing @entity4 efforts against @entity233 and has periodically struck targets inside @entity4 , as occurred in september , when a drone strike killed @entity31 - born cleric @entity281			0
@entity282 , @entity31 ambassador to @entity4 , said the transition laid out in the @entity75 plan as well as efforts to boost the economy and deliver basic services will be critical " in terms of our ability to defeat @entity233 and other violent extremist organizations in the country			0
