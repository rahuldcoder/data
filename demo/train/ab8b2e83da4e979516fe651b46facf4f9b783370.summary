-- @entity2 racing was deprived of its first @entity4 winner in more than 40 years after @entity5 , ridden by @entity6 , got up to beat favorite @entity7 by three quarters of a length in the @entity10 at @entity11 saturday			1
@entity7 had been aiming to emulate @entity12 by winning the @entity13 , the @entity14 and the @entity10 in the same season			1
but he was out - gunned by @entity5 , whose victory gives his owner , @entity18 , a sixth victory in this race and puts him second on the all - time list			0
@entity22 jockey @entity6 , riding in his first @entity10 , described his victory aboard @entity5 as " very easy , " saying he was very happy with the result			2
in a highly tactical race , pacemaker @entity25 dictated the early pace , with @entity7 content to settle towards the back of the field			0
the legend that is @entity7 but when the field turned into the home straight @entity7 's jockey , @entity36 , was unable to get his colt into space and @entity5 was able to open up daylight between himself and the chasing pack			2
when @entity7 was eventually maneuvered into position he ran on well to close the gap on the @entity45 horse but could only get to within three quarters of a length			0
@entity5 's victory means that not only does @entity2 's 42 - year wait for a @entity4 winner continue , but also that @entity51 does not become the first trainer in history to make a clean sweep of the @entity55 in one season ; his @entity58 operation had already won the @entity13 and the @entity14 with @entity7 as well as their fillies ' equivalents , the @entity61 and the @entity62			1
@entity7 's immediate future remains uncertain with a tilt at next month 's @entity65 now arguably more , rather than less likely following his defeat at @entity11 .			0

@entity7 fails in *bid* to win *prestigious* @entity4 in @entity10 at @entity11 , @entity2
winner of this season 's @entity13 and @entity14 beaten into second by @entity5 , ridden by @entity6
