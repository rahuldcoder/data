@entity0 -- president @entity3 should end a longstanding policy of not writing letters of condolence to families of troops who commit suicide , dozens of lawmakers urged him in a letter wednesday			1
the lawmakers warned that " our armed forces are in the midst of a suicide epidemic			1
" @entity16 statistics show that more than 200 troops have killed themselves this year , more than in 2008 , which was a record year			0
" by overturning this policy on letters of condolence to the families of suicide victims , you can send a strong signal that you will not tolerate a culture in our armed forces that discriminates against those with a mental illness , " the lawmakers wrote			1
the @entity28 has begun a review of the condolence policy , which the 46 members of @entity32 said should be completed as soon as possible			1
they also argued the policy of treating suicides differently from deaths in action flew in the face of military funeral procedure , which treats both the same			2
service members who kill themselves get " a full military burial , complete with flag - draped coffin and 21 - gun salute			1
we have not heard of any reports that military morale and discipline have waned as a result , " they wrote			0
they also argued that letters of condolence are " as much about respect for the personal loss that a family experiences as it is about an acknowledgment by our nation that we have lost a soldier			1
" the @entity28 said two weeks ago its review of the policy should " hopefully " conclude shortly			1
@entity28 press secretary @entity58 said the president himself asked for the review			1
" if the president did n't care , the policy would remain unchanged and unexamined , " @entity58 said at a december 9 news conference			1
despite this year 's rise in suicides , @entity16 officials said a recent trend downward could signal progress in programs intended to reduce the problem			0
between january and mid-november , 140 active - duty soldiers killed themselves , as did 71 @entity73 and @entity74 soldiers			2
that 's a total of 211 as of november 17 , when gen. @entity76 , the army vice chief of staff , briefed reporters about the problem			0
but he said the monthly numbers are starting to slow down as the year nears its end			0
" this is horrible , and i do not want to downplay the significance of these numbers in any way , " @entity76 said			0
for all of 2008 , the @entity16 said 140 active - duty soldiers killed themselves , while 57 @entity87 soldiers committed suicide , totaling 197			2
while the lawmakers cited attitudes toward the mentally ill , the @entity16 is still trying to tackle why soldiers are killing themselves			2
" we still have n't found any statistically significant causal linkage that would allow us to effectively predict human behavior			0
the reality is , there is no simple answer -- each suicide case is as unique as the individuals themselves , " @entity76 said			0
he also said there were troubling new statistics showing an increase in suicide rates among young soldiers who have never deployed , another factor puzzling @entity16 researchers			0
@entity1 's @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
