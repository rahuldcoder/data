looking only at the historic , social and political facts , you will miss the spiritual phenomenon that enabled us to come together to change the @entity5 and the nation in 1965			2
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , churches , synagogues , universities , trade unions , @entity16 , federal courts , @entity18 and even @entity19 came together in spite of historic conflicts and differences to create one of the greatest occasions in the history of our nation			2
this complex story has evolved into a visual psalm of spiritual power that leads us to the truths of democracy that defy , but also reveal , the ultimate power that occasionally breaks into our lives and lifts us to new cultural heights			2
this is @entity39 the movement and " @entity39 " the movie			1
@entity41 and @entity42 , with a team of brilliant , but mostly little - known actors and artists , attempted to tell this story in @entity47			2
they condensed years into minutes -- with great success			0
very few of the personalities , their families or their institutions will like this phenomenal effort , for it does not give them the credit or the recognition to which they feel entitled			0
we often get lost in the trees and miss the forest , and its life - saving grandeur and beauty			0
the opening scenes of " @entity39 " shocked me into a spiritual realm with the sudden explosion in the midst of four beautiful , laughing little girls in @entity69 at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72			1
that scene put me on an emotional roller coaster ride that reminded me that whatever success i have enjoyed was because of the sacrifice and suffering of others : from @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , to @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84			0
we are what we are because others risked and gave their lives to redeem our world from the evils of racism , war and poverty			0
@entity93 : the real story behind ' @entity39 ' the movie " @entity39 " has been years in the making			1
but most have given up because of the difficulties of accommodating so many constituencies , patents , property rights and the complex ego structure of our society			1
i 'm pleased that did not happen with this film			1
@entity39 then and now when you see " @entity39 " for yourself -- and you must -- look for the miraculous transformation of @entity112			1
and with only our faith in the creator as our source of power			0
" @entity39 " is a cinematic tribute to the democratic vision that we can live together in freedom without violence			1
fifty years later , the challenge is global as well as local			0
now we must learn to address the economic crisis of unemployed poor and under - employed workers			0
just as the answers 50 years ago revolved around voting , today 's issues revolve around jobs , the economy , gender , culture , religion and healing			2
but now , we know that we can			0
because of the miracle of @entity39 in 1965 and today as a film in 2015 , we can bear witness and embrace the powerful belief that we shall overcome			1

@entity142 : the movement for voting rights *achieved* a miracle , *depicted* in the film " @entity39 "
he says *peaceful* *protesters* worked with politicians to gain justice
