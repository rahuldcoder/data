-- a day after launching airstrikes and mortar shells in a remote part of the island of @entity7 , @entity2 security forces searched house - to - house wednesday for gunmen from the @entity11 who infiltrated the area last month and clashed with police			1
the group of @entity11 men is believed to number between 100 and 300			1
it arrived three weeks ago on the east coast of the @entity2 state of @entity19 , on @entity7 , demanding recognition as representatives of an old sultanate that ruled the area			1
efforts by @entity2 and @entity11 authorities to persuade the men to return peacefully to their homes in the nearby southern @entity11 failed , and the standoff descended into clashes last week that reportedly left 28 people dead , including nine police officers			1
@entity2 security forces said their offensive tuesday , which involved fighter jets , mortars and ground troops , achieved its objectives			1
however , they did not disclose the number of @entity11 fighters captured or killed in the operation , and the @entity11 group said the @entity2 attack failed to inflict any casualties			1
on wednesday , @entity2 police and armed forces combed the area around @entity44 , the village where the @entity11 had originally been holed up , in an attempt to flush out the gunmen , according to @entity47 , @entity2 's national news agency			1
alarm in @entity2 the crisis in @entity19 alarmed @entity2 over the ease with which the intruders entered the country from the nearby southern @entity11 , where a number of @entity55 rebel groups are based			1
it has also revived an unresolved territorial issue between the @entity11 and @entity2			2
the @entity2 forces ' task of tracking down the gunmen has been complicated by the @entity11 ' efforts to blend in with the local population , @entity63 , the head of @entity2 @entity64 , said at a news conference wednesday , according to @entity47			1
@entity63 said one gunman was believed fatally shot early wednesday after ambushing @entity2 security forces , but that the other attackers had retrieved his body			1
there are strong ethnic ties between many inhabitants of @entity19 and the southern @entity11			0
people and goods regularly go back and forth across the porous sea border between the two			0
the @entity11 men have called themselves the @entity76 of the sultanate of @entity78 , a former @entity55 power in the region that once controlled parts of the @entity11 and @entity7			2
its influence has since faded , and it is now a clan in the restive southern @entity11			0
the sultanate 's leadership has been driven by internal power struggles in recent decades , but the squabbling family members appear to have united in the recent decision to send their followers to @entity19 and stake a claim to their former territory			0
' no casualties ' @entity96 , a spokesman for one of the sultanate 's leaders in @entity100 , said he had spoken twice wednesday with the leader of the armed group in @entity19 , who reported that the men were in " good condition " and prepared for another possible attack			2
he claimed the group had suffered no casualties from the assault tuesday because the @entity2 planes had bombed an area vacated by @entity11			1
the sultanate is still open to talks , but the group in @entity19 will not return to the @entity11 , @entity96 said			0
the situation on the ground appears to be getting more complex with reports that other @entity11 fighters , sympathetic to the sultanate 's cause , are joining the group in @entity19 , despite efforts by @entity2 and the @entity11 to tighten sea patrols in the area			1
@entity96 said tuesday that other people from the region were joining the sultanate 's followers , although he did n't know who they were			0
and @entity129 , a founding leader of the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) , a @entity55 rebel group that signed a peace deal with the @entity11 government in 1996 after decades of armed rebellion , said he believed former fighters from the organization were with the sultanate 's followers in @entity19			2
he said if any current @entity130 members had gone there , they had done so without authorization			0
a faded power established in the 15th century , the @entity78 of @entity78 became an @entity55 power center in @entity142 that at one point ruled @entity19			0
but the encroachment of @entity146 colonial powers , followed by the emergence of the @entity11 and @entity2 as independent nation states , steadily eroded the sultanate 's influence			2
@entity151 is now a province within the @entity11			0
but the historical connection still fuels tensions between @entity2 and the @entity11 , with @entity100 retaining a " dormant claim " to @entity19 through the @entity78 , according to the @entity155			2
the @entity11 claims much of the eastern part of @entity19 , which was leased to the @entity158 in 1878 by the sultanate of @entity78			0
in 1963 , @entity160 transferred @entity19 to @entity2 , a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal			0
@entity2 still pays a token rent to the sultanate for the lease of @entity19 .			0

@entity2 forces try to flush out @entity11 fighters on @entity7
the @entity11 group says it suffered no casualties from an attack tuesday
@entity2 police say one @entity11 gunman may have been killed wednesday
between 100 and 300 @entity11 arrived by boat on the @entity2 coast in *february*
