-- building a home near a moon crater or a lunar sea may sound nice , but moon colonists might have a much better chance of survival if they just lived in a hole			2
that 's the message sent by an international team of scientists who say they 've discovered a protected lunar " lava tube " -- a deep , giant hole -- that might be well suited for a moon colony or a lunar base			1
the vertical hole , in the volcanic @entity16 on the moon 's near side , is 213 feet wide and is estimated to be more than 260 feet deep , according to findings published in @entity20 , a journal of the @entity22			1
more important , the scientists say , the hole is protected from the moon 's harsh temperatures and meteorite strikes by a thin sheet of lava			1
that makes the tube a good candidate for further exploration or possible inhabitation , the article says			0
" @entity37 lava tubes are a potentially important location for a future lunar base , whether for local exploration and development , or as an outpost to serve exploration beyond the @entity37 , " writes the team , led by @entity43 , a senior researcher with the @entity45 space agency @entity44			1
" any intact lava tube could serve as a shelter from the severe environment of the lunar surface , with its meteorite impacts , high - energy uv radiation and energetic particles , and extreme diurnal temperature variations			2
" lava tubes have previously been discovered on the moon , but the scientists say the new hole is notable because of its lava shield and because it does not appear to be prone to collapse			1
lave tubes exist on @entity61 and also have been found on @entity62			2
the cylinder - shaped caverns can be carved out by lava flows , volcanic eruptions , seismic activity or ground collapse resulting from meteoroid strikes			0
the scientists used high - resolution images from a @entity45 moon orbiter called @entity73 to discover this lunar lava tube			1
the findings were published november 12 , but they grabbed the attention of the public this week			0
@entity78 is reportedly working on plans to return to the moon by 2020 and to set up a temporary lunar colony by 2025 as part of the @entity83			0
funding for the program , however , remains somewhat in question			0
the @entity88 space agency could not be reached for comment .			0

scientists find deep hole on moon that could be suitable for colony
discovery of " lava tube " is published in journal of @entity22
lava tubes have been found before , but this one is protected by " lava sheet "
report says that shield protects hole from meteorites and harsh temperatures
