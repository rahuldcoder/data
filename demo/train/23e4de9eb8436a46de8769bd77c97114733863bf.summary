@entity1 , @entity0 -- botanists believe they have discovered one of the world 's largest carnivorous plants in @entity7			1
nepenthes northiana - the carnivorous pitcher plant prepares to tuck into a rat			1
the giant pitcher plants were located on @entity12 in @entity13 , central @entity14 by a team led by @entity17 botanist @entity16			1
the second largest species , now called @entity19 , has been named in honor of the @entity17 's world - renowned natural history presenter sir @entity23			1
the new discovery measures up to 30 centimeters in diameter and is formed by a tendril which inflates into a large cup - shaped trap			0
@entity16 told @entity2 : " around the mouth of the pitcher are secretions of nectar which attracts insects and small animals			2
the rim has lots of waxy downward - pointing ridges which help prey fall directly into the pitcher			2
" the pitchers are half full of a liquid consisting of acids and enzymes which help break down its prey			0
" the insectivorous , sometimes carnivorous diet is crucial for the plants ' survival says @entity16			1
" these plants grow in really harsh areas where soil quality is very poor -- often pure gravel or sand			0
catching insects allows the plant to augment nutrients that it otherwise would n't have access to			0
" @entity16 along with his colleagues @entity57 and @entity59 have discovered more than 20 new varieties of pitcher plant in recent expeditions and have also made two rediscoveries			1
one of those rediscoveries , @entity65 , was first recorded in 1907 but was subsequently lost when the @entity66 in @entity67 was bombed towards the end of @entity69 @entity16 and his team believe they are the first explorers to observe the plant in the wild in over a century			0
the @entity65 produces a spectacular , football - sized , red pitchers that are large enough to catch insects and small animals			0
in many of the traps , @entity16 's team found giant centipedes and 10 centimeter - long spiders			0
the @entity82 says that there are around 600 species of pitcher plants			1
most familiar , perhaps , is the @entity86			0
but bigger species like the @entity19 , @entity89 and the world 's largest known pitcher plant , nepenthes rajah are able to capture animals as large as rats , as can be clearly seen in the picture above			1
" these plants have evolved to catch insects			0
but on rare occasions they do catch rats and mice			2
the first reports of these plants catching rats was made in the 19th century by a @entity104 explorer called @entity105 , " @entity16 said .			2
