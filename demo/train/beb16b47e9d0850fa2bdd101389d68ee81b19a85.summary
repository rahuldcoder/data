@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the days following the horrendous attacks against the @entity6 on 9/11 , all the talk in @entity4 was about the need for bipartisanship			1
republicans and @entity10 promised that they would work together to protect the home front and capture those who were responsible			1
on the day after , @entity10 and @entity13 followed the traditional post-military crisis ritual of promising to work on policies in bipartisan fashion			1
@entity18 sen. @entity17 -- who was still struggling to gain her sea legs in her first year on @entity20 , after having spent eight years serving as the first lady during some bruising partisan battles -- announced that it was important to be " united behind our president and our government , sending a very clear message that this is something that transcends any political consideration or partisanship			2
" republicans also promised political peace			0
house speaker @entity33 assured the nation that " we are in complete agreement that we will work together , that we want to share information , that we will be ready to move on whatever the president suggests , and we will go through the debate and the actions of @entity40 in a bipartisan way to make that happen			1
" the kind of partisan sniping that voters were accustomed to , he and his colleagues said , would be a thing of the past			2
the political question on september 12 was how long this unity would last : would the worst terrorist attack ever on @entity6 soil really transform the politics of national security ? ten years later , it is evident that the answer was clearly no. the period of good feelings did not last long			0
one of the most striking aspects of @entity60 was that even a tragedy of this scale could not tame the partisan forces that shape @entity6 politics			1
@entity65 flared over one of the most important measures that @entity40 had to deal with in the fall of 2001 : airport security			0
the administration proposed that the federal government take a larger role in guarding airports , but only if @entity40 granted the president the power to exempt airport security workers from civil - service protections			2
the @entity13 insisted that the government needed flexibility when hiring and firing workers so that it could properly handle security concerns			1
@entity10 opposed the president 's plan on the grounds that , in their minds , president @entity85 was trying to use the excuse of national security to weaken unions ; republicans charged that @entity10 were holding up the legislation to please organized labor			1
according to @entity96 majority leader @entity96 , " what the @entity10 want , is 30,000 new dues - paying contributors			1
" for its part , the @entity97 established a website called " @entity100 , " which criticized @entity13 whip @entity13 for stifling the legislation			1
each side blamed the other for the holdup			0
congressional democrats held a rally in front of the @entity20 with pilots and flight attendants			0
this was just was just a taste of what was to come			0
during the 2002 elections , national security became part of the campaign			0
in one of the most notorious cases , @entity13 launched an attack against sen. @entity120 of @entity121 , a triple amputee as a result of combat in @entity125			1
@entity120 , a moderate @entity126 whose model had been the centrist @entity128 , had sought a compromise on the labor provisions in @entity85 's homeland security efforts			0
in one devastating ad , supporters of his @entity13 challenger , @entity6 rep. @entity133 , who had received five student deferments and one medical deferment during the @entity136 , flashed an image of @entity139 before attacking @entity120 for his positions on homeland security			1
" really good policy is really good politics , " explained @entity146 adviser @entity145 , sensing how the @entity13 ' national security positions could help win the election , " it 's the right thing to do for the right reasons			1
the domestic agenda right now is security			0
it 's covering up everything else			0
" while there was some bipartisanship after 9/11 , with many @entity10 supporting the @entity158 as well as the wars in @entity160 and @entity161 , the parties blasted each other on the issue of national security at almost every turn			1
despite our nostalgia for times when the parties joined forces on foreign policy , politics rarely stops at the water 's edge			1
the moments like 1947 to 1949 when key members of each party work together are exceptions , not the norm			2
during the famous 80th @entity40 , which president @entity182 later made his foil in the 1948 campaign , @entity180 @entity13 @entity179 and the president worked closely together to create the modern national security apparatus to fight the @entity186			1
the @entity187 , which created the @entity188 and the @entity189 , as well as the @entity190 and the @entity191 , were all products of this bipartisan alliance			2
of course , the moment of good feelings disintegrated in the next few years with the bitter battles of the early @entity186			0
the irony is that partisan battles continue over foreign policy even when there is a basic consensus on policy			2
this was true during the @entity186 , when most politicians were prepared to be tough against communism , and it is the case today when president @entity207 , despite the campaign of 2008 , has continued with most of @entity85 's war on terrorism			2
indeed , recent revelations suggest that the president has barely dismantled any of the counterterrorism programs that were in use			0
could the promise of september 12 ever be fulfilled ? certainly today there are enormous areas of consensus between the parties , such as over most counterterrorism policies , over the need for strong homeland security programs and even for strong military vigilance with countries such as @entity225 and @entity226			0
nonetheless , the partisan forces that play out on the campaign trail are simply too great to overcome			1
if 9/11 taught us anything , it 's how deeply rooted partisanship is in our modern political culture			0
even a tragedy of its magnitude could barely contain the forces that perpetually rip apart members of the two parties			2
ten years ago , the parties came together			0
but they came together just for a brief spell			0
in the long span of history , it was as if the moment ended before either side could even blink			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2

@entity251 : politicians of both parties *pledged* to work together after 9/11
he says that bipartisan spirit after attacks *evaporated* *quickly*
@entity249 says @entity10 , @entity13 *clashed* over status of @entity261 workers
he says partisan forces too powerful for most politicians to overcome
