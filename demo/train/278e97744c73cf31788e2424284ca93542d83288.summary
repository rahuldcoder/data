-- what does a sporting legend do when they walk away from the cut and thrust , the adrenaline fueled buzz of top flight competition ? in many cases they make a comeback in an attempt to rediscover former glories and some like tennis player @entity14 , who won three more grand slams , make a success of it			2
but more often than not in ends in failure , with seven - time @entity21 champion @entity20 , who quit for the second time at the end of this season , and multiple world boxing champion @entity25 , knocked out in his comeback fight , recent notable examples			2
in golfer @entity29 's case , you get " busier than i 've ever been " and pursue a business career while running a foundation and looking after a young family -- all with the inner drive and determination that took her to the top in her chosen sport			1
her decision to quit back in 2008 came as a shock			2
she was only 38 and still a contender at the highest levels , but once she made the break it was total and final			0
her last competitive event was in @entity45 in december of that year and she has not trod the professional fairway since , marrying her second husband , @entity47 , in 2009			0
they have two young children , @entity50 born that year and @entity51 in 2011 , who arrived 13 weeks premature , but thankfully with no ill effects			1
but through her commercial and golf design interests , promoting the @entity55 brand of clothing , @entity29 is still heavily involved in the game she loves			1
timing in business just like golf is everything and the @entity61 told @entity0 that launching new ventures in a global recession was " tough			1
" growing portfolio but she was not going to allow something as trivial as economic turmoil to divert her from her goals and @entity29 has put her name to a growing portfolio of signature golf courses , mostly in @entity72			1
back at home in @entity75 , @entity73 is the base for her academy , where players of all standards can sign up for tuition , and her non-profit making foundation , which offers young golfers opportunities to fulfill their potential			0
she also has an interest in a winery and financial group , as well as making occasional appearances on the @entity88			0
like her male counterparts such as @entity90 and @entity91 , who have built up business empires off the course , @entity29 believes the work ethic is the key			1
" there are a lot of similarities with the things i learned on the golf course , such as focus and determination , " she told @entity0			0
" without drive and vision you ca n't start anything , it 's a little bit in you			0
" @entity29 retired just at the time when @entity72 players were beginning to dominate the @entity109 , including @entity110 , who the @entity61 has mentored			1
it helps they are near neighbors in @entity114			0
" i share my experience of what it 's like to be at the top , to always look at the big picture , " said @entity29			1
@entity72 success she believes that the wave of success that @entity110 and others from the region are riding , will continue after @entity72 players won all four of the women 's majors in 2012			2
" they have tremendous support from their families , are prepared to start practicing at seven o'clock in the morning and stay there all day , " said @entity29			2
the introduction of golf at the 2016 @entity134 -- @entity29 was in the delegation which presented to the @entity136 -- will she believes further fuel the ambition of women golfers from all over the world to challenge the traditional @entity141 domination of the @entity109			1
@entity29 led the charge of overseas players during her glittering career , which saw her win 72 @entity109 events , including 10 majors , and 21 other tournaments			1
she is the career leading money winner at over $ 22 million and broke new ground by becoming the first woman in 58 years to compete in a men 's @entity153 event			0
her appearance at the @entity156 in @entity157 put women 's golf to the top of the sporting headlines and despite narrowly missing the cut , @entity29 did enough to earn the respect of her male counterparts			1
" i wanted to challenge myself , to get better , to learn from the best in the world , to push myself to the extreme			0
" boost interest where @entity29 led , others like @entity169 followed in men 's events , but she knows that the @entity109 still has a long way to go to match the coverage given to the @entity153			2
to boost interest , she would like to see the two tours run combined events as the same venue as happens with @entity179 and @entity181 tennis tournaments			0
" it would be great for fans " and would pave the way for more equality in prize money she believes			0
the 42 - year - old was recently named vice-captain to fellow @entity61 @entity188 for the @entity189 in @entity190			1
she performed the same role as @entity192 beat the @entity141 in the biennial team event in @entity194 in 2011			2
but is she ever tempted to make a playing comeback ? " i think about when i turn on the golf on tv , " she admitted			0
" i remember what it was like to come down the stretch in the lead , but then i look at my kids and know that i am happy where i am in my life			0
" to play with my husband and two children would be my favorite foursome now			0
" juggling the demands of a busy professional and business life , her diary is hectic , and finding time for her young family , would test anybody			1
but one has the feeling that @entity29 is totally committed to her new life away from professional sport and wild horses could not drag her back on the fairways of the world .			1

she won *93* tournaments including 10 majors in glittering career
