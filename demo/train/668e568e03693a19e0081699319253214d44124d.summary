whenever @entity3 carries out a new atrocity , whether it 's beheading a group of @entity7 @entity6 or enslaving @entity9 women in @entity10 or burning its victims alive , the big question most people have is : why on @entity12 is @entity3 doing this ? what could possibly be the point ? adding to your list of enemies is never a sound strategy , yet @entity3 ' ferocious campaign against the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity9 , @entity6 , and @entity23 who do n't precisely share its views has united every ethnic and religious group in @entity27 and @entity10 against them			1
@entity3 is even at war with its most natural ally , @entity30 in @entity27			1
the @entity31 and the @entity32 went to great lengths to hide their crimes against humanity			0
instead , @entity3 posts its many crimes on social media for global distribution with seemingly no thoughts for the consequences			1
@entity3 ' beheading of the @entity43 journalist @entity42 in mid-august galvanized much of the western world against the group and led to an intensified @entity43 - led air campaign against @entity3 , which , according to @entity43 military officials , has killed at least 6,000 of its fighters			1
the burning to death by @entity3 of the @entity52 pilot , @entity53 , galvanized much of the @entity55 world against the group and has brought @entity52 into the @entity43 - led campaign against @entity3 in a much more aggressive manner			1
the beheading of 21 @entity7 coptic christians in @entity60 by an @entity3 affiliate led @entity7 's air force on monday to drop bombs on @entity3 positions in eastern @entity60			1
former @entity66 director @entity65 is reported to have kept a maxim on his desk that read , " as a general rule , the way to achieve complete strategic surprise is to commit an act that makes no sense or is even self - destructive			0
" @entity3 keeps surprising the world and its actions do indeed seem to make no sense or are self - destructive			1
so what is going on here ? a key window into understanding @entity3 is its @entity80 language " in - flight magazine " @entity82			2
last week the seventh issue of @entity82 was released , and a close reading of it helps explains @entity3 ' world view			2
the mistake some make when viewing @entity3 is to see it as a rational actor			1
instead , as the magazine documents , its ideology is that of an apocalyptic cult that believes that we are living in the end times and that @entity3 ' actions are hastening the moment when this will happen			1
the name of the @entity82 magazine itself helps us understand @entity3 ' worldview			2
the @entity27 town of @entity100 is where the @entity101 is supposed to have predicted that the armies of @entity103 and " @entity104 " would meet for the final battle that will precede the end of time and the triumph of true @entity103			0
in the recent issue of @entity82 it states : " as the world progresses towards @entity114 , ( ' the @entity115 ' to be held at @entity82 ) the option to stand on the sidelines as a mere observer is being lost			0
" in other words , in its logic , you are either on the side of @entity3 or you are on the side of the @entity121 and infidels			2
when @entity43 aid worker @entity123 was murdered by @entity3 in november , " @entity124 " -- the masked @entity125 murderer who has appeared in so many @entity3 videos -- said of @entity123 : " we bury the first crusader in @entity130 , eagerly waiting for the rest of your armies to arrive			1
" in other words , @entity3 wants a @entity135 ground force to invade @entity27 , as that will confirm the prophecy about @entity100			2
we live in an increasingly secularized world , so it 's sometimes difficult to take seriously the deeply held religious beliefs of others			0
for many of us the idea that the end of times will come with a battle between " @entity104 " and @entity103 at the obscure @entity27 town of @entity130 is as absurd as the belief that the @entity149 had that their human sacrifices could influence future events			0
but for @entity3 , the @entity82 prophecy is deadly serious			2
members of @entity3 believe that they are the vanguard fighting a religious war , which @entity155 has determined will be won by the forces of true @entity103			0
this is the conclusion of an important forthcoming new book about @entity3 by terrorism experts @entity160 and @entity161 who write that @entity3 , like many other " violent apocalyptic groups , tend to see themselves as participating in a cosmic war between good and evil , in which moral rules do not apply			0
" this also similar to the conclusion of an excellent new cover story about @entity3 in the @entity186 magazine by @entity187 who writes , " virtually every major decision and law promulgated by the @entity169 ( another name for @entity3 ) adheres to what it calls , in its press and pronouncements , and on its billboards , license plates , stationery , and coins , ' the @entity178 methodology , ' which means following the prophecy and example of @entity101 , in punctilious detail			0
@entity23 can reject the @entity169 ; nearly all do			0
but pretending that it is n't actually a religious , millenarian group , with theology that must be understood to be combated , has already led the @entity43 to underestimate it			1
@entity3 members devoutly believe that they are fighting in a cosmic war in which they are on the side of good , which allows them to kill anyone they perceive to be standing in their way with no compunction			0
this is , of course , a serious delusion , but serious it is .			0

the group 's atrocities have angered @entity43 , @entity52 and @entity7
@entity209 : @entity3 actions only make sense if you realize that its aim is the apocalypse .
