-- @entity1 made most of the headlines prior to @entity4 's game against @entity5 in the @entity6 , but it was another striker -- a forgotten one -- who ended up as the star attraction hours later			1
@entity12 was signed with much fanfare from @entity14 a year ago for about $ 36 million , but injuries and the form of other strikers at @entity5 meant he only made two league starts in 2013/2014			1
inserted into the starting lineup by manager @entity20 , @entity12 netted twice in @entity5 's 3 - 1 win in the showdown between teams that finished 1 - 2 last season			1
" it was n't so many beautiful moments until now because i had so many problems last year , " @entity12 told @entity25			2
" but i do n't want to think about that			0
" now i just want to enjoy with this team , these players to win more titles			0
" substitute @entity33 got @entity5 's third , with @entity4 replying through @entity36 's own goal with less than 10 minutes remaining			1
indeed , only when falling behind by three goals did @entity4 -- which capitulated to give @entity5 the title in may -- come to life			1
it was a far cry from the corresponding fixture last term , when @entity4 largely ran the show in an entertaining contest -- a 2 - 1 @entity5 win -- on @entity46			1
@entity4 opted for a more defensive approach monday and could n't call on the flair of @entity1 , the flamboyant , controversial -- though not as controversial as the man he is replacing , @entity49 -- @entity52 international			1
he signed from @entity53 earlier monday			0
the result left @entity5 with two wins from two games , identical to the side expected to challenge @entity20 's men for the title , @entity60			1
@entity61 and @entity62 are the only two other teams with perfect records			2
@entity12 pounced from close range after @entity66 's poor clearance to give @entity5 a 1 - 0 lead at the break			1
and shortly after the break , in the 55th minute , @entity12 converted @entity71 's pass			2
" last year unfortunately ( @entity72 ) was injured a couple of times , " @entity71 told @entity25			0
" we saw that in pre-season he was on fire			0
i think it 's just the start of a big season for him			0
" @entity33 , on the pitch for a shade under 30 seconds , increased the lead after a perfectly weighted ball from @entity87 in the 69th before @entity4 's consolation effort in the 83rd			1
@entity90 banned in @entity92 , @entity91 manager @entity90 received an eight - match ban for his conduct in the second leg of the @entity96 against @entity97 on saturday			0
among his infractions was protesting with the fourth official and patting him on the head			0
he has since apologized for his actions , but it was n't enough to prevent the lengthy suspension			0
@entity90 , whose side won the trophy , will now miss , among other matches , @entity91 's derby against @entity97 on sept. 13			0
getting into trouble with the authorities is nothing new for @entity90 , who guided @entity91 to the league title last spring			0
he also missed @entity91 's @entity113 opener on monday due to a ban stemming from last season			2
@entity116 scored a long - range effort for @entity97 in its 2 - 0 win over newly promoted @entity119 in @entity97 's first game in the league			2
@entity122 began its season with a 3 - 0 win over @entity125 on the weekend .			2

@entity5 beats @entity4 3 - 1 in the @entity6 on monday
forgotten man @entity12 scores twice for the *defending* champions
@entity130 gets @entity4 's consolation in the dying minutes in @entity132
@entity134 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 lead the *standings* with *maximum* points
