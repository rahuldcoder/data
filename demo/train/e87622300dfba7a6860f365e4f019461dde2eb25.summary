-- minuscule levels of radiation from @entity5 's @entity4 nuclear plant incident have been detected in a widening number of @entity8 states , but the @entity9 reaffirmed this week that the levels represent no threat to public health			1
" to date , data from @entity9 's real - time radiation air monitoring networks continue to show typical fluctuations in background radiation levels , " @entity13 , director of the @entity9 's @entity14 , said in a statement monday			1
" the levels we are seeing are far below any levels of concern			1
" at least 15 states reported detecting radioisotopes in air or water or both			1
no states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide , a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine			0
@entity35 reported over the weekend that iodine - 131 was detected in the air near its nuclear power plants near @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41 , @entity42			1
" we know that it 's not coming from our plant , " said progress spokesman @entity43			0
had the @entity8 nuclear plants been responsible for the radioactive iodine , other isotopes would also have been found , he said			2
the levels detected were so low that authorities do not require they be reported , he said			1
sensors in @entity53 have also reported elevated levels of @entity55 in air samples			2
" none of these levels pose a risk to health , " the state 's @entity57 said			2
the @entity53 secretary of health said monday that microscopic amounts were also discovered friday in rainwater			0
he said the levels found posed no risk to public health			1
the @entity69 @entity57 said sunday that a monitoring station in @entity71 detected @entity55 in rainwater on march 22 , but had not detected any in air			2
in a question - and - answer page on its website , it says the amount detected should not concern residents			2
on monday , @entity78 gov. @entity77 said rainwater collected friday from his state 's nuclear power plant facilities contained low levels of iodine - 131 " likely originating from the events at @entity5 's damaged nuclear plants			0
but weekend tests of drinking water found no elevated levels of radioactivity			0
" the levels reported " are still about 25 times below the level that would be of concern , " @entity77 's office said in a statement			0
similar testing in other states , including @entity97 and @entity98 , has shown comparable levels of @entity55 in rainwater samples			0
trace detections were found in the air in @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity97			0
@entity106 spokeswoman @entity105 said @entity106 had detected trace radioactive elements , likely to have originated from @entity5 's @entity4 plant , in @entity109 and @entity40 -- but at a level " far below " reporting requirements			0
@entity9 is using the nationwide radiation monitoring system , @entity113 , to monitor the nation 's air and drinking water , milk and precipitation			1
an analysis from 12 monitors nationwide found " slightly higher " levels of radioactive isotopes in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity97 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , the @entity131 , and @entity98 over the past week , the agency said			0
" some of the filter results show levels slightly higher than those found by @entity9 monitors last week and a @entity136 monitor the week before , " the agency said			1
" these types of findings are to be expected in the coming days and are still far below levels of public health concern			1
" a spokeswoman for the @entity9 said monday that 90 percent of the 124 @entity113 monitors were working .			0

a growing number of @entity8 states are *affected* , but none at levels that threaten public health
at least 15 states report detecting radioisotopes in air or water or both
" the levels detected are far below levels of public health concern , " @entity9 says
