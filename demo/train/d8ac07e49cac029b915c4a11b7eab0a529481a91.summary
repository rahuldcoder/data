-- a frequently overlooked place of farms , friendly towns and relatively few people is , for now , the epicenter of @entity7 politics			1
the question is why - owa ? the answer is a quaint and quirky institution known as the @entity9 caucuses -- an unusual , old - fashioned evening of talking about the candidates running for president and then voting on them			1
separate caucuses are held across @entity9 as neighbors debate the pros and cons of candidates with each other before they vote among themselves , and that result then gets totted up with the other caucuses statewide to decide the winner			1
the @entity7 presidential campaign has been under way for months as @entity28 decide who they want to run against the presumed @entity30 candidate , the incumbent president @entity31			1
candidates have spoken at rallies , debated each other on tv and opinion polls are released at least weekly			2
but the @entity9 caucuses , to be held on tuesday january 3 , are the first time anyone will actually vote			1
" the @entity9 caucuses are really like nothing else in @entity7 politics , " said @entity0 political editor @entity38			1
" i mean , imagine a cold winter night , sub-freezing temperatures			0
it takes a lot for a person to come out to their local school , the local church and take part for about two hours in a caucus			0
you 've really got to be into the process			0
" @entity7 have long chosen their presidential candidates sequentially state by state			2
most states hold what they call ' primaries ' -- primary elections -- to choose delegates to attend national conventions later in the year that formally select the @entity63 and @entity28 party nominees			0
this year , all attention so far has been on the fight to become the @entity28 nominee because @entity31 is expected to be the @entity63 candidate			0
to a casual visitor the primaries look a lot like any election , with the familiar routines of voters , ballot boxes and booths			0
but @entity9 caucuses are different and the rules vary in the roughly 1,800 state precincts that hold them			1
there is n't necessarily a secret ballot ; sometimes there 's no ballot at all			0
after everyone gets a chance to express their opinions , the vote can be on paper , with a show of hands or , for @entity63 , just by congregating into groups corresponding to the different candidates and seeing who has the biggest group			1
it 's a particular kind of politics with a long past			0
the caucuses date back in different forms more than 150 years			0
but they never attracted much attention until the 1970s when @entity9 moved its caucuses ahead of the first primary and decided to stage them all on the same evening			1
the media started paying attention and candidates learned that a strong showing could generate headlines nationwide			0
even so , winning @entity9 does n't predict much because with just three million people , the state is so small , so rural , so white and , these days , so affluent			1
its agriculture - based economy is doing well enough to be spared the worst of @entity7 's economic downturn			1
a recent @entity117 / @entity116 poll found that nearly 90 percent of likely caucus - goers described their financial situation as good			0
the @entity117 says that 's about 20 points higher than the average nationwide			0
so maybe it 's no surprise that , looking back over the decades , the most popular candidates in @entity9 do n't tend to get their party 's nomination or the presidency			1
to be fair , @entity9 did do better than usual last time : it was half right			2
on the @entity28 side , @entity127 won his party 's caucuses in 2008 , but he did n't win the @entity28 nomination and he 's not the president today			2
the @entity63 caucuses that year were more telling			0
@entity31 did win them , the start of a long and surprising campaign that ended in the @entity137			0
so does @entity9 matter ? historian @entity138 writes at @entity139 that it does because @entity7 's media say it does			1
" @entity9 is first , " @entity138 notes			2
the " caucuses provide early evidence -- hard news -- on the progress of the presidential race			2
this is the perception of @entity9 's role , and it is therefore the reality ... " but there is more to the reality			1
even if @entity9 does n't add much to the process , it does subtract			2
after the @entity9 caucuses the most successful or determined candidates will stay in the race and head to the northeastern state of @entity158 for its primary , the first in the nation , on january 10			1
the others tend to start heading home			0
this year , the @entity28 race is so unsettled , with so many candidates trading the top spots in public opinion polls , that @entity9 could be unusually close and confusing			2
you can count on quirky .			0

after months of debates and rallies @entity9 is the first state where people actually get to vote for a candidate
the state holds caucuses where *communities* debate each candidate 's *merits* before voting , sometimes with a show of hands
@entity9 's status as first to vote means it is watched closely although it does not always pick the eventual winner
its issues are sometimes different to the nation -- so far @entity9 has been spared the worst of the economic downturn
