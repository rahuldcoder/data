@entity1 gov. @entity0 has vetoed a bill that would have prohibited police in that state from conducting warrantless searches of the cell phones of people under arrest			1
" this measure would overturn a @entity1 @entity13 decision that held that police officers can lawfully search the cell phones of people who they arrest , " the governor 's brief statement said			1
" the courts are better suited to resolve the complex and case - specific issues relating to constitutional search - and - seizures protections			0
" the veto dismayed privacy advocates and others who said it could allow overzealous authorities to trample citizens ' constitutional rights			0
@entity1 sen. @entity29 , who sponsored the bill ( @entity31 914 ) , responded : " this veto is very unfortunate			1
the message from the governor was rather incoherent			0
when you consider all the information that is accessible on one smartphone , if that same information was contained anywhere else police would need a warrant to search for it			1
so it makes no sense to carve out a legal exception for smartphone searches			0
" according to @entity49 rules , state legislators must wait a year before attempting to reintroduce this legislation			1
over the summer , @entity31 914 unanimously passed the @entity1 legislature			2
the bill would have protected against the warrantless search of personal and private information contained in the cell phones of people who have been arrested			1
this bill was inspired by a @entity1 @entity13 ruling in january in the case of @entity60			1
after his 2007 drug - related arrest , an officer with the @entity62 checked the text messages on @entity60 's phone and found incriminating messages			1
that state court ruling has privacy implications that reach far beyond text messages			0
it allows police in @entity1 to access any data stored on an arrestee 's phone : photos , address book , web - browsing history , data stored in apps ( including social media apps ) , voicemail messages , search history , chat logs , and more			1
also , depending on the use of location - enabled services or apps that store data on the phone , the police might also be able to infer the arrestee 's past whereabouts			2
on october 3 , the @entity91 @entity13 denied a petition to hear the @entity60 case			0
so with the governor 's veto , the state court ruling stands as law in @entity1			1
in a blog post about the @entity1 veto , law professor @entity98 contended that " governor @entity0 has it exactly backwards " because legislatures tend to move far more quickly than the courts -- an important advantage when dealing with issues that involve fast - changing technology			2
@entity98 also pointed out that there 's a conflict of interest when the executive branch , which oversees law enforcement in the state , is in a position to block laws that would limit the powers of law enforcement			0
what happens next ? @entity118 , staff attorney for the @entity119 ( which has been supporting the @entity1 bill , and following this issue nationwide ) expects an increase in law enforcement " fishing expeditions " involving cell phones			2
" i think we 'll probably start to see more questionable searches of cell phones in arrests that have nothing to do with cell phones , " he said			0
he cited a recent case before @entity1 's 6th @entity131 in @entity132 , where police pulled over a driver expected of driving under the influence			1
once they 'd arrested the suspect , they searched his cell phone and found evidence indicating possible drug trafficking activity that was unrelated to the original arrest premise			2
the court supported this search , so evidence from the phone was legally used in the case			0
aside from @entity150 concerns about self - incrimination , @entity118 and @entity29 both observed that this veto poses clear concerns for @entity154 and press freedoms in @entity1 -- and perhaps elsewhere , as other state governments and courts decide what to do about warrantless cell phone searches			2
noting how much the @entity161 protestors are using cell phones to organize and publicize the demonstrations spreading around the @entity91 , @entity118 said , " @entity1 police might decide to arrest you for disturbing the peace , or illegal camping , and then check your phone and see messages coming through from organizers			1
" said @entity29 , " reporters who are covering protests and other events that attract police attention should be concerned about getting arrested and then having the info they gathered , including info about sources , ending up in police hands			0
" since several states are wrestling with this issue , @entity118 expects it will likely end up before the @entity91 @entity13			0
but in the meantime , if you 're in @entity1 and are concerned about privacy and your constitutional rights , it 's a good idea to protect your cell phone and other electronic devices with a password or encryption			1
in our january story on warrantless cell phone searches , @entity195 of the @entity196 told @entity197 that if you keep your phone locked , " the police can ask you to unlock your phone -- which many people will do			0
but they almost certainly can not compel you to unlock your phone without the involvement of a judge			0
" the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity205 .			0
