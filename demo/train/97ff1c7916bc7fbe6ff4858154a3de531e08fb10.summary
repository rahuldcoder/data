-- with @entity2 on the sidelines , @entity1 took center stage in the battle with @entity6 for the crown of @entity9 's most influential player on saturday			1
@entity6 's injury - time heroics prevented @entity11 from falling eight points behind in the title race ahead of the international break , as the @entity15 forward scored a last - gasp winner against @entity17			1
@entity18 had no such problems , despite also going behind at home to @entity21 , with @entity23 's team running out a 4 - 1 victor for eight wins out of eight			1
@entity26 scored two of those goals , but it was his fellow @entity30 who ran the show -- scoring the last himself , setting up one for the @entity33 and providing the spark for @entity36 's strike that made it 2 - 1			1
with @entity2 recovering from a second injury this season , @entity1 has been given an increasing amount of responsibility following his $ 75 million move from @entity42 and is showing he can fit into the role of team player as well as solo star			2
however , it was @entity26 who responded to @entity48 's 10th - minute opener , firing in a superb equalizer from outside the penalty area			0
@entity1 's burst helped @entity52 to set up midfield veteran @entity36 for his second goal this season , then the @entity55 slid a perfect pass for @entity26 to slot home in the 64th minute			1
the roles were reversed on 70 as @entity26 squared the ball to @entity1 , who turned and fired in a low shot for his second league goal since arriving			2
@entity6 took his @entity9 tally to seven , one behind @entity2 and @entity64 's @entity63 , as he blasted the decisive goal in @entity11 's 3 - 2 win at @entity17			1
@entity11 twice came from behind to deny the home side , which led through @entity68 in the 57th minute and then @entity69 with four to play in regulation			0
captain @entity71 leveled the first time , stabbing in at the far post from a corner , and 20 - year - old substitute @entity75 made it 2 - 2 before @entity6 's deflected shot went in off the post in the fourth added minute			0
coach @entity79 had made several changes following the midweek @entity82 win over @entity83 , in which @entity6 and @entity84 both scored twice , and the @entity85 was again without injured marquee signing @entity86			0
@entity11 went two points above fourth - placed @entity89 , which beat @entity90 3 - 0 on friday			1
second - placed @entity64 will seek to keep a perfect record in sunday 's home clash with @entity93			0
meanwhile , @entity94 claimed top spot in @entity96 for the first time this season despite dropping points for the first time in a 1 - 1 draw at third - placed @entity100			1
the @entity102 and @entity103 champion will end the weekend with a one - point advantage over @entity100 and previous leader @entity105 -- which crashed 2 - 0 at @entity107			2
@entity94 's last league loss was 33 games ago at @entity100 , and @entity111 's team seemed on track for a seventh win from eight this season after @entity115 scored on the half hour			1
however , @entity116 leveled immediately and goalkeeper @entity117 kept out a barrage of attempts by the @entity120			0
@entity105 crumbled after @entity96 defender @entity121 was sent off in the 81st minute for hauling down @entity122 midfielder @entity123 -- @entity124 converted the resulting penalty and @entity55 strike partner @entity126 doubled the lead			0
@entity107 moved up to fourth on goal difference above @entity129 , held 1 - 1 by @entity130 on friday			2
seventh - placed @entity131 and @entity132 drew 1 - 1 to be on 11 points along with @entity134 , which beat @entity135 4 - 1			1
@entity136 moved five points clear at the top in @entity85 after crushing fourth - placed @entity139 3 - 0 , despite having a player sent off at the @entity141			0
the capital club made it seven wins from seven as veteran @entity145 scored a double and @entity148 also found the net before halftime			0
@entity145 smashed in from @entity151 's layoff then converted a disputed penalty after the @entity154 international was brought down in the box			0
@entity148 was set up by @entity156 just before the break , and @entity136 could afford to lose defender @entity158 at the end for a second yellow card as the home side suffered a first defeat under former @entity164 coach @entity163			0
@entity165 earlier moved up to eighth place with a 1 - 0 win at struggling @entity168			2
in @entity170 , @entity169 went three points clear of @entity172 following saturday 's 2 - 1 win at home to @entity175 , with substitute @entity176 scoring an 87th - minute decider			1
@entity179 champion @entity172 visits third - placed @entity180 on sunday .			0

@entity1 *inspires* @entity18 to eighth win from eight matches in @entity185 league
@entity55 scores one and sets up one in saturday 's 4 - 1 win at @entity21
third - placed @entity11 stays six points *adrift* after *snatching* a late victory
@entity94 top in @entity103 despite dropping first points of season
