i love everything about it : gathering three generations around the table , pausing for a moment with heads bowed to thank @entity9 for our abundant blessings , carrying a tradition across the centuries , watching my beloved @entity14 play football			0
i even love clanging the pots and scraping the plates afterward			0
and i especially love the eating			0
we are traditionalists in my family , so it 's turkey and stuffing , and three kinds of pie			0
i am hoping this year to add one more item to the menu : a small serving of conscience			0
for as we gorge ourselves , @entity30 is contemplating drastic cuts in food aid for the least of our brethren			2
food stamps , formally known as @entity35 , or @entity36 , help poor people eat -- simple as that			1
the average @entity36 household has a gross income of just $ 744 per month			2
i 'll bet @entity42 speaker @entity41 spends more than that each month just on cigs and merlot			0
requirements to receive food stamps have become so tight that @entity48 , the nation 's leading domestic hunger - relief charity , estimates that only 57 % of food - insecure @entity51 are even eligible for food stamps			1
can you imagine being too poor to afford food , but too " rich " to qualify for food stamps ? @entity56 : @entity36 is n't about a free lunch so benefits under the @entity36 program go to the poorest of the poor -- and they 're not exactly living high on the hog off food stamps , either			1
the average monthly @entity36 benefit per person is $ 133.85 , or less than $ 1.50 per person , per meal			1
a buck - fifty per meal does n't go far			0
by the third week of the month , most people 's benefits have already run out			0
and yet even that miserly amount is too generous for some @entity72 politicians			2
rep. @entity73 , @entity74 , has likened food aid for the poor to robbery , telling a gathering of his fellow @entity79 , " the role of citizens , of @entity82 , of humanity is to take care of each other , but not for @entity86 to steal money from those in the country and give to others in the country			1
" @entity56 : how do you stretch your food dollars ? i am sure @entity73 is a good man , but i prefer to listen to @entity95 on the role of @entity82			2
after all , he said , " for i was hungry and you gave me food , i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink			0
" @entity73 , like nearly all @entity100 , voted to cut @entity36 by $ 40 billion over ten years			1
those cuts would kick 3.8 million @entity51 off food stamps and end subsidized school lunches for 210,000 hungry children			1
some 170,000 of the people who will be kicked off food stamps are veterans -- an especially heartless way to treat those who have worn the uniform			1
here 's the beauty part : while literally taking food out of the mouths of the hungriest @entity51 , the @entity42 @entity72 farm bill protects corporate welfare , in the form of subsidized crop insurance ( among other programs )			1
rep. @entity117 , @entity118 , somehow manages to talk about this without her head exploding -- which means she has greater self - control than i do			0
" republicans are continuing to protect crop insurance subsidies to some of the wealthiest @entity51 and at the same time trying to cut the very program that helps keep children , seniors , and disabled individuals out of hunger , the @entity36 , " she said			1
" unlike food stamps , crop insurance subsidies are not subject to means testing or payment limits			1
some farms annually collect more than $ 1 million in crop insurance			0
" @entity56 : how to feed your family from a food bank @entity117 is too polite to mention that one of the well - to - do welfare recipients is her colleague , @entity73			2
@entity73 has received $ 3.48 million in taxpayer subsidies for his @entity74 farm , including $ 70,000 in 2012 alone			1
by contrast , the average @entity74 food stamp recipient gets $ 1,586.40 per year			0
@entity145 of @entity146 's was an economic adviser to the @entity72 presidential campaign of sen. @entity149			2
he studied the effect of various government spending to stimulate the economy			0
@entity154 what he said gives us the most bang for the buck -- the single best expenditure we can make to stimulate economic growth ? ( @entity161 roll , please			1
) that 's right -- food stamps			2
for every dollar we spend on @entity36 , @entity145 said , $ 1.73 surges through the economy : farmers make more money , truckers haul more food , grocers hire more cashiers			1
oh , and hungry people get a meal			0
it 's a win - win - win			0
so this @entity2 i will once again thank @entity9 for my family , my freedom , and my food			2
and pray a little extra for the @entity72 politicians to help their fellow @entity51 -- and our economy -- by supporting food stamps			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity186 : as we gorge at @entity2 , @entity42 wants to cut food stamps for millions
he says @entity36 gives a small amount of money to the very poor ; comes out to $ 1.50 a meal
@entity72 rep. @entity73 , who voted to cut , got $ 3.48 million in farm taxpayer subsidies , he says
@entity199 : economists say food stamps spur economic growth ; @entity72 should restore them
