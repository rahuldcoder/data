ten years ago i was one of a small number of @entity3 lawyers who opposed the invasion of @entity5 on the grounds that it was illegal and unauthorised by the @entity8			1
we were all strong advocates of the notion that the rule of law was the bedrock of any civilised and democratic society			0
without it our lives would be subject to a free for all in which might becomes right			0
the embodiment of the rule of law internationally has been the @entity20 and the @entity21 -- direct results of the devastation inflicted by the @entity25 regime in @entity26 during the @entity27			1
no one wanted a repeat of such flagrant aggression , so the @entity20 was drawn up to replace gunboat diplomacy with peaceful measures overseen by the @entity33			1
this was not a new vision			0
in 1945 the @entity20 was ratified by the @entity36 , the @entity3 , and the majority of the 50 states who had originally agreed to this framework			1
thrashed out by experts and with massive support behind it , the document was no maverick , outlandish or oddball agreement			0
the @entity20 is not gobbledygook -- it is full of common sense , and it should be obligatory reading in every school			1
opinion : why @entity53 was fought for oil @entity55 1 makes clear that the main purpose of the @entity8 is to " maintain international peace and security and to that end to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace " and to act in accordance with justice and the principles of international law			0
it is for the @entity8 to determine what collective measures should be taken -- not for individual states to take unilateral or bilateral action			2
this is not rocket science , but the simple application of restraint and respect for the rules that @entity3 and @entity36 agreed to when they signed the @entity20			1
but this is not what happened 10 years ago at the behest of @entity36 president @entity82 and @entity3 prime minister @entity83			1
their agenda was quite different -- to remove a dictator , @entity86 , whose regime was abhorrent			2
but regime change , however desirable , is not permitted by the @entity20			1
if it were , the powerful nations could go round the world picking off the weak -- or more particularly the states thought to be hostile to their own ambitions			0
in case some politicians found it difficult to understand all this , article 2 ( 4 ) spelled it out in unequivocal terms : " all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state "			2
everyone recognised there might have to be exceptions to this rule , but the charter specifically does not authorize preemptive nor preventative action ( i.e. getting in first ) on the basis of a perceived future threat			1
interactive : how has the war changed you ? the only way around this predicament was for the @entity121 axis to fabricate a case of threat			1
this they did by the knowing manipulation of flawed intelligence about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in @entity5 ( which were never found ) , and the bogus claim that @entity86 could deploy such @entity131 within a 45 - minute window			2
this argument , which was false , became the main basis for invasion because the only other route to war had been closed off by international law			2
the @entity8 has the power to authorise military intervention once all other options have been exhausted and the peace and stability of a region is in jeopardy			0
at the time it became a debate about whether @entity5 satisfied these criteria by its failure to abide by @entity8 resolutions concerning disarmament			2
the principal @entity33 resolution 1441 , adopted in november 2002 , called on @entity5 to disarm its wmd and cooperate with @entity8 weapons inspectors			2
@entity153 made clear they continued to be in charge but had not authorised the use of force in @entity5			2
exclusive : @entity157 on ' terrible mistake ' in @entity5 @entity83 insisted to the @entity3 public that he would only support a war if a second @entity33 resolution authorising the action was passed , but the resolution never came			1
@entity82 and @entity83 realised they would never get one , and so they prepared to go it alone with a cobbled together coalition			1
troops had already been committed on the ground			0
there was no going back			0
this was why @entity82 and @entity83 were not prepared to allow the weapons inspectors , who were in @entity5 , any more time			1
inspectors had found no evidence of @entity131 in the lead - up to the war and never did , but were ordered to go home			0
i am not alone in these views			0
there is a substantial consensus of international legal opinion which recognises the illegality of the invasion			0
@entity186 , then the @entity8 secretary general , told the @entity187 in 2004 that the @entity20 had been breached and that the invasion was not sanctioned by the @entity33			1
full coverage : the @entity53 , 10 years on in the @entity3 we are still waiting for the results of a public inquiry into the circumstances in which the decision to go to war was taken			0
@entity83 never wanted this inquiry but was forced by the power of the victims ' families and public opinion to accede			2
so far two years have gone by while the government has obstructed disclosure and publication			0
it is intolerable and inexcusable			0
i believe @entity82 and @entity83 should be tried for war crimes as defined by international law			1
in 1998 the @entity207 was established to deal with individuals who commit international crimes			0
four transgressions were agreed -- war crimes , crimes against humanity , genocide , and the crime of aggression			1
unfortunately only the first three have been brought into effect			0
the @entity3 , to their credit , signed up to the court			0
but the @entity36 did not , lest its leaders end up accused of crimes before the court			0
@entity224 : @entity5 suffocates in cloak of sorrow whilst the act of aggression can not be prosecuted , war crimes committed thereafter can be			1
so for example to launch an attack , like the invasion of @entity5 , with the knowledge that its effect is likely to cause incidental death or injury to civilians or the natural environment ( @entity239 8 ) will render the perpetrator liable to prosecution			1
the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium in @entity5 by coalition forces ( euphemistically called collateral damage ) upon vulnerable civilians falls within this definition			2
as a result , a legal consortium of which i was a part , and other groups in @entity252 , petitioned the @entity207 for action against @entity3 politicians over their involvement in the war			2
getting @entity36 leaders hauled before the court is even more problematic -- the @entity33 could refer @entity36 to the court , but the @entity36 is a permanent @entity33 member and can veto any potential referral			0
alternatively individual member states could incorporate these crimes of universal jurisdiction into their own domestic law			0
then if a @entity36 perpetrator of war crimes travelled into that country 's jurisdiction , they could be arrested			1
the @entity3 has such a provision , but when put to the test by @entity3 citizens seeking arrest warrants in relation to the planned visits of @entity280 political and military leaders -- who were potentially responsible for war crimes in @entity283 -- the @entity3 government reprehensibly placed impediments in the way of its future use			1
so @entity82 can safely plan a visit for tea with @entity83 in @entity290 without fear of prosecution in the @entity3			1
the whole episode regarding the @entity53 is a tawdry tale that has subverted the rule of law and tarnished the reputation of international law			0
without accountability for @entity301 states , how can we expect the rest of world to respect these principles ? it is time for @entity82 and @entity83 to be thoroughly , independently and judicially investigated for the crimes i suggest have been committed and it is time for the crime of aggression to come into force			1
until this is redressed , la lotta continua !			0

@entity315 : @entity82 , @entity83 should be tried for war crimes over invasion of @entity5
*mansfied* : regime change is not permitted by the @entity20
