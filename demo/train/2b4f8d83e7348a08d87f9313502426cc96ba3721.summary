in @entity1 , hair can be a contentious topic			2
many @entity4 are persuaded to eschew their natural hair in favor of chemical straighteners , wigs and extensions			1
afros and dreadlocks are rarely depicted on local television , and those that wear their hair naturally can be shunned from their offices			1
" i have one friend who has natural hair , and she has to wear a wig to work			1
they will not even let her inside the building with natural hair , " says @entity21 , founder of @entity22 , one of the few salons in the capital that specializes in natural hair styles			1
the tide is slowly starting to turn , however , thanks in part to the efforts of a community movement , @entity34			1
the group currently hosts bi-monthly meet - ups where participants exchange stories and tips on how best to care for natural hair			1
" my hair was breaking and one day i just decided to clip it			2
it was something i just did for myself with no motivation to start a movement , " says @entity43 , the group 's founder			1
" when i started the group , i just started with three or five friends who were wearing their hair natural			1
we added another friend , and another , and in three months we were about 200			0
today we are a group of 8,500			0
" since then , the movement has become mainly one of encouragement ( @entity56 has reappropriated the word " nappy " to be a mash - up of " natural " and " happy " , while @entity34 is shorthand for @entity1 )			1
earlier this year , members around the world sent in clips of themselves dancing to @entity64 ' " happy			0
" still , those embracing their natural locks continue to face resistance from the community at large			2
@entity69 writes a blog on the subject and has launched a natural hair consultancy and product line in @entity1			1
@entity76 - born , the @entity75 transplant was fascinated with local perceptions of natural hair so much that she 's in the process of filming a documentary , titled " is that ( all ) your hair ? " @entity84 has interviewed dozens of women about their attitudes regarding their hair			1
" i ask women , ' now that you 've gone natural , what comments do you get ? ' for some of them , it 's : ' what 's wrong with you ? do you not have enough money to go to a salon ? did your husband leave you ? go get a perm , ' " she says			2
" it 's starting to change slowly but surely , but it 's not as rampant as it is in the @entity101			0
but it 's on its way , " she adds			0
there is also still a lot of misinformation about what 's involved in caring for natural hair			1
many locals concede that the knowledge has been lost , no longer passed down from mother - to - daughter			0
" it 's strange , because in @entity117 , people are supposed to know their own hair , but we do n't most of the time , " notes @entity21 , who says that girls start using relaxer as early as three - years old			1
@entity69 says reasons for this could be myriad			0
the media could play a role , as could the colonial legacy ( the @entity75 was a @entity125 colony from 1843 to 1960 )			2
" under colonization a lot of things happen			0
you want to get closer to the colonizer because that 's the person that holds the power , so you let go of a lot of things that resemble your culture , " she surmises			0
as to why the time is suddenly ripe for a natural hair movement , @entity21 ties it to a larger trend of national pride			1
" in the past few years , more people want to know about their traditions and what they have , " she says			0
" you see this with people who have been studying in @entity149 or the @entity150			0
when they come back , some people ask them , ' why did you come back ? you should have stayed there			0
' but the people that came back love their country			0
they want to develop their own country and learn more about it , and this is the same mind set that 's made it possible for people to change their hair			2
" mainly , though , the movement is about empowerment , says @entity69 , and about making women ( and some men ) feel better about themselves			0
" i think hair and self esteem are linked			0
i know my own self - worth as a black woman has been linked to my hair and i developed more self - confidence when i started wearing it natural , " she says .			2

natural hair movement @entity34 is growing in @entity75
though trendy on the street , offices still *discourage* natural hair
some start relaxing their hair as young as 3
