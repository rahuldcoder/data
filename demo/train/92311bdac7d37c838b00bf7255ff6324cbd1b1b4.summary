@entity8 , who replaced @entity9 as @entity5 president in january , told @entity0 that repeating the stringency and efficiency of the @entity13 will be a real challenge			1
" it 's going to be difficult to replicate in @entity7 the system that was put in place with the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) and @entity19 , " @entity8 told @entity15			1
" ( the facility and systems ) worked beautifully and that 's because the national anti-doping organization was very , very good			1
in @entity7 , we could n't say that at the moment ... they do n't have a laboratory			0
their laboratory lost its accreditation because clearly it was inefficient			1
" @entity5 suspended testing at the @entity34 city 's @entity32 laboratory last august after it failed to meet the organization 's @entity35 ( @entity35 )			1
the implications of that suspension have already been felt by football 's world governing body @entity39 which , as a result , will be transporting players ' blood and urine samples to @entity47 in @entity48 during the @entity49 which starts in @entity50 on june 12			1
construction blunders and delays have blighted the buildup to football 's showpiece , while concerns over @entity7 's @entity3 facilities are mounting by the day -- a two - week strike over pay and conditions by more than 2,000 @entity62 workers ended thursday			1
ongoing concerns have prompted the @entity18 to agree to increase the frequency of visits -- led by @entity67 executive director @entity66 -- and establish dedicated task forces			2
@entity7 organizers announced wednesday that @entity34 will spend 24.1 billion reais ( $ 10.8 billion ) on infrastructure projects to ensure the @entity3 are delivered on time			1
earlier in the week , @entity7 's mayor @entity72 said he looked forward to @entity66 's visit saying that there was " no reason for concern " and that the " @entity62 has nothing delayed			2
" @entity8 did not write off the city 's prospects of delivering first class drug - testing facilities on time , pointing to the fact that the suspended organization is currently being re-established and a new building is nearing completion			1
but more needs to be done , he said			0
" too often they think of the building being the important thing			0
well that 's only one thing , " said the former chairman of the @entity90			2
" you actually need to put the proper equipment in it and then above all you need to put the proper people in it			2
and you then have to work up the proper standards so you can get it accredited again			2
" @entity32 has yet to respond to @entity0 's request for comment			0
@entity8 is n't pushing the panic button just yet , but called on @entity34 's lawmakers to take responsibility			1
" this is n't really an organizing committee problem			0
this is a government problem , " he said			0
" it 's up to them to develop and fund their national anti-doping organization and their laboratory			0
if they do that , yes it can be done			0
" if they do n't and it slips , it 's a problem			0
