-- @entity1 feels right for this fall , when the wooly weave of @entity4 tartans is likely to show up on store shelves			1
it appeared in the fall runway collections of designers like @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
it 's no surprise : from @entity19 's famous tweeds to @entity21 's voluminous gowns to @entity23 's preppy sportswear , the interplay of colors and crossing lines in a tartan weave allow designers to communicate a range of emotions			1
think of the outrageous punk statements from @entity27 or the staid , aristocratic panache from @entity29			0
" you can expect to see plaid on just about everything , " said @entity30 , the accessories editor for @entity31			0
while stores are always filled with plaid in the fall , she said , this year , coats , long pencil skirts , shoes and already otherwise - printed shirts are getting the plaid treatment for crowds of all ages			1
" red and black buffalo plaids are the hottest right now , " she said , and teens especially will be looking for unique plaid combinations for the once - again trendy grunge look			1
but then again , plaid has been on trend for a long , long time			0
@entity1 's long history in fact , it 's been around since at least 1500 @entity54 , according @entity55 , an assistant professor of textile development for the @entity56			1
that 's the age of the oldest surviving piece of plaid in the world			0
" as soon as people learned to weave , they figured out that if you put different colored yarns in the two directions the yarn went , you got an interesting crossing ( pattern ) , " @entity55 said			0
" color combinations became associated with power and status			0
in the 16th and 17th centuries , the @entity4 highlanders really developed this into a system , and that 's where we get the tartan concept			1
" @entity1 is a plaid woven in wool , designed in @entity82 that identifies different clans , aspects of @entity86 society and political allegiance			0
centuries ago , @entity4 men used yards of tartan to wrap around their bodies , keeping them warm on the windy mountainsides			1
that piece of woven wool was called a pledd -- it 's where the word plaid comes from , @entity55 said			0
modern @entity97 often use " plaid " and " tartan " interchangeably , she said , although " plaid " is also the word for a check weave that 's not an official tartan			1
but fashion designers and plaid enthusiasts have @entity108 @entity107 to thank for its popularity , said @entity111 , a historian and @entity113 professor emerita			1
because queen @entity107 was so enamored of @entity82 and @entity4 tradition , she adopted tartan in her own clothing , and made it quite formal , @entity114 said			1
the bold blacks , reds , blues and greens used in many clan tartans today come from the @entity125 era , she said , when chemical dyes became widely available			0
before then , tartans were made from naturally dyed wool , which is drab in comparison			0
" what queen @entity107 did , people copied , " @entity114 said			1
" @entity1 went into high fashion with women 's dresses from the middle of the 19th century , on			2
" fashion has always followed the " trickle - down theory , " @entity114 said : when the highest echelon of any society does something , everyone else follows			2
and nobody copied queen @entity144 's penchant for plaid better than the @entity97 , @entity114 said			2
an @entity147 tradition ? americans are known to look to @entity149 for fashion inspiration -- it 's an old habit			2
in colonial times , @entity97 were well connected with their families in @entity154			0
it took only six weeks to get to the colonies by boat , @entity114 said , and the latest fashions and fabrics were often sent to @entity147 women by their relatives			0
as the @entity147 and @entity164 grew , @entity97 of @entity163 heritage helped to establish tartan 's place on the continent			1
during the late 1880s , one @entity4 immigrant trader was known to share his clan 's tartan with @entity97 in exchange for buffalo hides , said @entity173			1
the pattern of red and black check ( which became a favorite of lumberjacks , cowboys and hunters ) was a big hit , she said , and soon became known as " buffalo plaid			0
" the @entity183 in @entity184 was also responsible for the homogenization of tartan and plaid in the @entity147 , she said			2
around the turn of the last century , the wool weaving mill served people living in the @entity191 , who mainly wore plaid shirts and leather pants during the frontier development of the 1880s and ' 90s			0
@entity204 " started weaving traditional @entity4 plaids but then they also started making up their own , " @entity55 said , using " more @entity147 " colors like browns , golds and greens			1
@entity204 plaids went on to became associated with genteel country lifestyles -- say , a weekend in @entity207 or a gentlemanly ranch in @entity209			2
the very idea of a tartan has also left footprint on @entity213			2
many @entity147 states , branches of the military , universities and institutions have their own tartan			2
@entity220 , a holiday dedicated to @entity4 , is celebrated on april 6			1
you can make your own tartan on the @entity223 and it will be internationally recognized as such			2
there 's even a museum dedicated entirely to tartan in @entity227 , @entity228			0
@entity229 , who proudly claims @entity4 heritage on both sides of his family , spends his retirement volunteering at the museum			1
he enjoys pointing out examples of his family tartans to visitors			0
" people see me in a kilt and they automatically think , ' ok , he 's @entity4 , ' but when this voice came out , " he said , of his thick @entity247 accent , " you could see the surprise on people 's faces			1
" he regularly wears a kilt to church or even shopping with his wife			0
" i think it 's great that people would wear tartan , regardless of whether it 's a shirt or a kilt , " he said			0
