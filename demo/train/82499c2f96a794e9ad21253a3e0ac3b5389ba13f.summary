-- you 've probably never heard of the race , but there 's no doubt you 'd appreciate the action			1
the athletic skill and white - knuckled bravery possessed by @entity9 whitewater kayak racers can only be described as impressive			1
over the race 's 15 - year history , 412 professional and expert whitewater kayakers of the highest caliber have traveled from around the globe to participate in the event near @entity17 , @entity18			1
they race not for money or corporate sponsorship but for bragging rights			2
the race begins each year at noon on the first saturday in november			2
organizers estimate that between 140 and 150 racers will compete this saturday			1
an estimated 1,000 like - minded river - loving enthusiasts will be on hand to watch			2
( @entity0 photos : see images from the 2010 race ) organization of race logistics and details is homegrown ; there are no emergency medical services available , and the entire affair is basically @entity36			1
close relationships between organizers and paddlers and the informal setup contribute to the race 's revered reputation among paddlers			1
the first race , organized by local kayaker @entity45 , was held in 1996 , with only 16 kayakers participating			1
that number has grown immensely , with 136 racers competing in 2010			1
the most unique element of the @entity52 race is the great sense of brotherhood and friendship amongst racers , organizer @entity49 said			1
" everyone who races the @entity61 is friends for life , because of the shared experience , " @entity57 said			0
" @entity66 race mixes danger and extreme with just enough safety			2
" the perception of " just enough safety " undoubtedly depends on a paddler 's risk threshold			2
the race 's course drops roughly 250 feet over six - 10ths of a mile			1
this is squarely @entity76 whitewater territory , defined by the @entity77 as " @entity78 " or " expert			1
" liability waivers must be signed , and a line from this year 's @entity83 section of the registration website illustrates the dangers : " @entity86 is exceedingly dangerous			2
doing so entails known and unanticipated risks , which could result in physical or emotional injury , paralysis and death , " the site reads			0
" this is not theoretical : several boaters have died running the @entity9 and another has been paralyzed from the upper body down for life			0
accidents resulting in dislocated shoulders , deep lacerations and extensive dental work are common			0
please do not take your decision to race lightly			2
" in october 2010 , first - time participant @entity102 traveled from his home in @entity105 to the @entity106 , just east of @entity17 , on weekends to test himself on the @entity61 's unique rapids and river features ahead of the race			1
" as a first - time racer , i just want to get through			2
i want to have a clean run , hopefully a fast one , and keep my heart from exploding , " @entity102 said in anticipation of the race			0
( watch the video to see how his run in last year 's race turned out			1
) @entity102 will run the @entity61 again this year			0
" after last year , i 'm totally hooked			0
" but he has n't had much time to train for his second run			0
" my training has consisted of sitting at my desk in kayaking position for 10 hours a day			0
because , as we all know , sitting is the foundation of kayaking technique , " @entity102 said			0
beyond actual participation , just being on hand to watch the race is a test of physical stamina			0
spectators ' arrival on the steep and rocky banks that hang over the swift water is preceded by a two - mile hike , a seemingly vertical descent into the river gorge and a final trek upstream that is more of a climb than a straightforward walk			0
if you want to experience the race , you 're going to work			0
most race enthusiasts perch themselves on a slippery outcropping above an 18 - foot waterfall , a raging inferno of water affectionately dubbed " @entity150			1
" the water above @entity150 flows with immense power through a narrow slot that racers call " the notch			0
" the notch is roughly 6 feet wide and is notoriously the most dangerous spot on the river			0
it is through this obstacle that racers must pass and quickly set up to drop over @entity150			1
this is where much of the race 's carnage and therefore entertaining action occurs , so onlookers perch here , anxiously anticipating the racers ' miscalculations and unfortunate binds			1
as racers pass through " the notch , " they often flip or find themselves out of control as they head for the lip of @entity150			0
this can result in a backward tumble or worse : an upside - down fall over an 18 - foot waterfall with a shallow shelf of rock just below			1
in addition to bragging rights , race winners come away with handmade glass trophies			0
but it 's the daring required to participate that earns @entity189 competitors a badge of honor in boating circles .			0

@entity196 kayak racers brave @entity76 whitewater
the homegrown race has grown from 16 participants in 1996 to about 140
in the most *dramatic* stretch , there 's a drop over an 18 - foot waterfall
