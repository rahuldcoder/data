it 's all @entity1 's fault			1
i 'm not just talking about the strong likelihood that i 'll be ugly - crying in public alongside fellow fans of " @entity6 " in a theater near me this weekend -- i mean the fact that i 'm reading much fiction at all these days			1
but apparently i 'm supposed to be embarrassed about my love of @entity1 's books			1
says who ? says @entity13 , author of a recent @entity15 jeremiad that proclaims : " adults should feel embarrassed about reading literature written for children			1
" @entity19 goes on to assert that realistic ( i.e. non-supernatural , non-dystopian ) young - adult - targeted books are somehow supplanting works of literary fiction in adults ' reading lives and how that 's a " shame			1
" it 's the " should " ( @entity15 's italics , not mine ) here that vexes me most			1
it implies that someone else 's hierarchy of taste and personal experience takes precedent over your own , when in reality , letting go of that is one of the great spoils of achieving adulthood			1
let me get anecdotal here for a second			0
in my mid- 20s , when i was a good deal less assured about my own worth in the world , and rather too highly dependent upon the approval of others , i dated a man who was hampered by neither of those issues			0
he was six years older than me , born and bred in @entity54 , possessed of an @entity56 degree from a @entity57 , and let me know in no uncertain terms that he thought my taste in art and media was lowbrow and crappy			0
i was harangued for my " @entity68 " fixation , poo - poohed for my love of " @entity64 " and told that my favorite book -- at the time " @entity66 " -- was " so high school			0
" what should i read then , i 'd ask			2
something that means something , he 'd say , something important			0
but what i neglected to ask was " important to whom ? " where did my own pleasure , curiosity and opinion fit in ? i 'm embarrassed ( yes , that word ) to say that at the time , i knuckled under			2
while my boyfriend and i found common ground with @entity84 books and @entity86 films , i distanced myself from the words , sounds and images that connected me to the world at large , made me think and feel , and moreover , gave me pleasure			1
for my annual birthday movie outing , i opted for " @entity93 " and tossed aside my @entity95 books to heft up " @entity96 " instead			2
was i suddenly a more worthy , worldly person , with bigger , better thoughts ? not that i could tell , but i did get an awful lot quieter about admitting to people what made me happy -- and maybe a little bit judgmental about other people 's tastes , too			2
and that makes the world ( at least my world ) a little smaller			0
but that was a long time ago			0
i 've grown up , and the fellow in question has , too			0
i told him i 'd finished " @entity96 " after we 'd broken up -- just to impress and spite him , and he admitted to me that he never actually finished any @entity113			0
we 're friends now , and periodically send recommendations of bands and movies and ridiculous @entity118 videos to each other , not for the sake of bettering or shaming one another but simply to share something wonderful with someone who will be delighted by it			0
a brief history of young adult literature which brings me back to @entity1			1
i surely had n't stopped reading in the interim years -- and in fact started writing for a living -- but did so with maybe a little more duty and less abandon than in years past			1
my shelves , and eventually my @entity134 app , groaned under the sturdy weight of nonfiction object histories , cultural critiques and work - related memoirs and biographies that made me conversant at parties and a little less giddy about the cerebellum			0
and if i read any @entity143 fiction or chick lit , i kept my mouth glued shut about it			2
but then along came " @entity6			1
" it had been recommended to me by smart people i trust , and i had a multi-hour plane flight , so why not ? it undammed me			2
not just with the obvious , snotty sobbing i did in seat @entity153 , but in the way that for the first time in ages , i wanted to announce to the world at large that i was in big , sloppy love with a book and i was n't about to apologize to anyone for that			2
this quirky novel about two kids in love who are battling life - threatening illness took the brains and psyches of teenagers seriously			0
it made me hyper - conscious of the seconds between ( hopefully ) hitting the tarmac safely and a treacherous cab ride on the @entity172 , because they were standing in between me and the arms of my husband			0
it made me feel things and do things , and for the life of me , i ca n't understand that 's inferior to knowing more things			1
and i 've read a lot of @entity143 since then : old favorites from @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , and a new canon from writers like @entity1 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and a whole host of others who deserve to be heard			0
i read plenty of other books ( yes , for " grownups " ) , too , and probably even more than i used to because my hunger for good words is so keenly whet			1
they go down a lot more easily now that i 'm not choking on all that embarrassment			0
books that changed your lives are you an adult who reads young adult fiction ? we 'd love to hear all about it in the comments below .			1
