@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i think of the story of @entity6 women , i immediately think of my mother and i want to use her story as a frame of reference in how @entity6 leaders can improve the lives of women			1
my mother is a huge inspiration to me but sadly , many @entity6 women do not have the opportunities that she has			1
they are the backbone of our nations and their success will lead to the success of @entity6			1
using this platform afforded to me , i would like to tell our leaders the five things @entity6 women need to succeed			1
i was born to a woman who having completed high school in the early 1970s , got married , had me and went about the business of being a mother and wife			2
i must have been about seven or eight years old when my mother got her first job as a secretary			2
today my mother is @entity32 ( @entity1 , @entity33 , @entity34 ) for @entity35			2
she 's pursuing a degree in clinical psychology			2
i think i should mention that my mother went back to school at 50			0
she turned 60 in february 2012			0
education it can never be said enough			1
nowhere is it as clear as it is in @entity6 that educating a woman is educating a nation			1
my mother is who she is today and my siblings and i have turned out to be who we are because she went out at the age of 50 , sat in the same room as people half her age , so she could learn			0
she already had a job she was great at but she had a thirst for knowledge			0
and today , my mum is a better mother , grandmother and friend all because of the education she had and the knowledge she pursues to this very day			1
@entity60 : @entity1 's queen of radio 2			1
economic empowerment the @entity6 woman needs to be able to fend not just for herself but also for her children			1
this is something my mother always drummed into me and i am largely my mother 's daughter ; driven , focused but also determined to be financially independent			0
in my early 20s , i could n't figure out why she went on and on about getting a job , being good at it and earning my own money -- but today in my 30s i get it			0
what drives me crazy about the policy around this is that money is never allocated in a way that benefits women and home first			1
instead , it feeds a handout mentality , we never give women a hand up			1
it 's a really horrible cycle			0
this is why i 'm very proud of what my mother did			0
if you can give a woman a hand up and she can stand , she 'll help another woman too			0
anytime i go to an area where there 's poverty , we never give just money , we give seeds so they can plant or animals they can rear			0
i 'm involved in a greenhouse project for the areas where the land is dry			0
the people always have to pay us back in produce and even when they are done paying , they are so excited because they have money in their pockets , you would think they were @entity106			0
that is what happens when you empower a woman			0

access to health care my mother had a job that gave her medical cover and hence access to doctors and healthcare facilities for herself and us			1
for as long as i can remember my mother took charge of our health			1
my brother [ @entity121 ] was born with a blockage in one of his lungs and had the worst case of asthma i knew of , but mum 's health cover took care of that and @entity121 's subsequent health needs , as he battled with asthma throughout his teens			1
she was a better mum not because she understood medicine , but because she had access to health facilities and doctors			1
too many women are forced to watch their children die , even from the simplest , most treatable illnesses , simply because of poor access to healthcare			1

exposure in a world where women have such few role models -- looking at my mum whose mother tilled the land -- she had no way of doing better for herself or charting a bigger and better path for me and my siblings , if it was n't for the exposure to a wider world that she got through the working			2
you can not become what you can not see			0
today , mum pursues her dream in clinical psychology and supports a daughter who chose to adopt because my mum is more exposed to different circumstances than most			0
do n't just tell women what is possible , show them			2
@entity166 when all else is gone , nothing remains but hope			2
if my mother had written this piece , she would say pray and work			0
to an international audience , i call it hope with a purpose			2
as long as we give the women of @entity6 hope , so long as we do n't tread on their dreams and those they have for their children -- these women will rise and with them their children and right alongside them this continent			1
today , the daughter of @entity186 stares at the world through the lenses of @entity2			0
who would have thunk it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity60 is a well - known and sometimes *controversial* radio *personality* in @entity6
she believes that providing for women of @entity6 , provides for nations
lists education , hope and access to health care among top five things women need
