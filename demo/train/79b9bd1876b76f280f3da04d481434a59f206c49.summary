-- in @entity2 he 's an icon and to the rest of the cricketing world he 's simply known as one of the greatest ever batsmen			1
one the game 's greats , @entity7 is more than just a player in @entity2 , he 's an icon			1
@entity7 picked up a bat at the age of 4 in @entity13 and from that day on fell in love with the game			0
" the only thing that was on my mind was , ' i want to play for @entity2 one day , ' and i was pretty sure and confident that one day i will , " he told @entity0 in @entity13			1
in fact he made his test debut for @entity2 at the age of 16 facing @entity23 's fearsome bowling attack , just two years after making his first - class debut for @entity13			1
despite a baptism of fire in that first international match and getting hit on the mouth by a ball from @entity30 , he took his own game forward and has become known for the positivity of his play and the compact efficiency and brilliance of his shot - making			1
making his first test hundred at the age of 17 against @entity39 he has racked up the records in a 19 - year career			1
in 2000 he became the first batsman to score 50 international hundreds , and is the highest scorer in one day internationals			1
he joined an elite group in 2007 when he became only the third player to pass 11,000 runs in test cricket			0
nicknames in cricket are common , but only if you 're a really exceptional player do you get one that 's complementary			2
@entity7 has joined that elite as the " @entity7 " which sits nicely next to other great batsmen , @entity56 and @entity54			2
but perhaps no higher praise came from @entity59 cricketing legend @entity58 who once said that @entity7 was the only player that reminded him of himself			0
like all sportsmen he 's suffered from injury , and now 35 - years - old , many are wondering if his best days are behind him			1
playing for @entity2 against @entity39 and @entity64 last summer and at the beginning of 2008 , many commentators thought that his normal aggression and daring were missing from his game			1
his form was also heavily criticized after the 2007 @entity70 , and injury forced him out of the international series against @entity73			0
but for the man used to batting away tricky deliveries , this criticism gets a typical positive response : " i 'm not one to dwell on the past			0
i like to move forward and these challenges , these hurdles in between , they bring the best out of me			0
they motivate me even more			0
" he 's currently facing the challenges of the rapid - fire version of the game in the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) , masterminded by @entity88 , that despite it 's glitz and hype has been criticized for losing some of the finer points of the sport			2
" it 's so full of excitement			0
i personally do n't feel that it 's dumbing - down the game			2
it 's just another version of cricket			0
if the game is going to be globalized in the form of @entity87 , then why not ? it 's better for cricket , " he told @entity0 .			0
