@entity0 -- @entity2 , the dating website for people seeking affairs with married individuals which claims 20 million members worldwide , has dropped another pin on its map -- @entity11			1
the company cast out its first line in @entity14 in june , reeling in under half a million members within three months , said @entity16 , company ceo , " making it our most successful launch ever			1
" the infidelity website launched in @entity0 last month -- it 's 29th market since starting 11 years ago in @entity20 -- and now has 80,000 members			1
that makes @entity0 the most successful launch rate per capita , showing a " massive pent up demand , " @entity16 said			1
while @entity11 countries are typically seen as more conservative , he says different cultural values do not diminish the demand for infidelity			1
" we 're just trying to address a universal behavior and pattern , targeting people from all walks of life			2
infidelity is in our dna			1
i 'm just riding a tidal wave , a social change where women lead and men follow , " @entity16 said			2
" this is their unfaithful , sexual revolution			0
infidelity trumps a lot of it , there 's no culturally stopping it , no religious groups can , " he said			1
the site is run on a credit based purchase where members have to pay to contact each other			0
in @entity0 , the starter package with 100 credits costs hk $ 360 ( us $ 45 ) and is enough to initiate chat with 20 women , @entity16 said			0
for women , the service is free			0
his website does n't make people cheat , @entity16 argues , but rather provides a platform for those who have already made up their minds to step out on their spouse			1
" people want to choose what they want to do			0
long before i created @entity2 , people were unfaithful			1
i do n't think i can convince people to have an affair , but if people are miserable , i feel like society can benefit from my service , " he said			0
in @entity14 where it is legal for men to seek sexual entertainment in brothels and massage parlors , @entity16 says the localized website will allow " miserable women " to find an outlet with other married men			1
out of the 160,000 women on the @entity14 site , 68 % of the site 's traffic are made up of married women , according to @entity90 , the parent company of the website			1
infidelity is " clearly a global phenomenon , " but there are some variations from region to region			1
" many of the @entity99 countries -- @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , have lower female adoption rates than in @entity104 and @entity105			0
in @entity107 we see a greater percentage of married women over the age of 40 using the service than anywhere else in the world , " @entity16 said			0
what stands out in @entity0 is the rate of single men that have signed onto the site , he said			0
" normally as a worldwide average we have about 9 to 11 % single men on @entity2 , but in @entity0 we have about 18 % , " @entity16 said			1
the company plans to expand to " 10 to 11 " more markets in @entity11 before the end of june 2014 , @entity16 said			1
the website is expected to launch in @entity124 next month			1
@entity2 statistics show that 325,000 people in @entity127 have been trying to log onto the site to create a profile even without spending a dime on marketing in @entity127 , @entity16 said			1
but countries like @entity127 and @entity132 raise thorny legal issues for the company			0
" we 'd love to go to the @entity137 government first and do it through the front door ... but not if they required us to give out our users ' information , " he said			0
in @entity132 , where adultery is still a crime , the company has consulted with lawyers to ensure that they do not overstep legal boundaries , although @entity16 believes this is not an issue			0
the website operates as a " communication platform and only that , " and the company does not get additional economic benefits from offline meetings , he said			1
" so from a vicarious liability perspective we have no true issue -- if you start holding inanimate objects responsible for what is ultimately a personal decision then you would have to find @entity161 or the @entity162 , hotel rooms and a whole host of others ' responsible ' for an affair , " he said			0
the company runs advertisements online and through a number of television networks and radio shows , but not all media companies want to be associated with a business that promotes adultery			0
@entity176 does not accept @entity2 ads , and @entity178 and @entity179 refused to air the company 's commercials during the @entity182			1
@entity16 believes infidelity can help save marriages in the long term , and is much less costly than getting a divorce			1
" the vast majority of affair seekers are having an affair because they do not want to leave ... they cherish their children , their economic situation , extended family , " he said			0
" all that they are hoping to change is the monotonous monogamy within their relationship			0
by finding that cathartic outlet through an affair it helps them stay within that marriage			0
" infidelity is often seen as destructive to marriages and families , but dr. @entity207 , lecturer at the @entity208 at the @entity209 with an expertise in gender , marriage and family said it depends on whether couples agree on the same notion of marriage			2
" the normal conception is that marriage should be monogamous , but we have to take into account that some can not be rationalized within this framework , and some people need to seek emotional and sexual needs outside a marriage of convenience , " she said			0
" but , if couples do n't have the same notion and there 's an element of deception , then of course it would be rather disastrous and someone will get hurt			2
" according to @entity207 , the website may reflect a shifting culture of a more self - centered and individualized approach where people are less inclined to sacrifice self fulfillment for the marriage and the family			2
however , she said that the website is harmless to those who believe in fidelity			2
" it 's just a commercial endeavor , for those who believe in monogamy , if they saw the ad , they would just look at it as a joke or a gimmick , " @entity207 said			2
regardless of what the outcome of the marriages are , @entity16 has no qualms about making money off infidelity , saying that he , like many others , is doing a service to society			2
" the hotel industry probably could n't survive			0
think about jewelry stores where people make duplicated purchases , " @entity16 said			0
" i 'm monopolizing it directly , but if you define infidelity liberally , pornography , strip clubs and massage parlors are also making money off of it			2

@entity2 , the dating website for extra marital affairs makes its second launch in @entity11
@entity284 's ceo says infidelity is " clearly a global phenomenon "
the website plans to expand to " 10 to 11 " more markets in @entity11 before june 2014
