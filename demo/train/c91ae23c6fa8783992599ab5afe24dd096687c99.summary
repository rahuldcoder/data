@entity0 -- president @entity3 's former defense secretary , @entity2 , says if the @entity6 had listened to his advice on @entity9 troop levels in @entity10 , the country 's security situation may not have unraveled			1
" to this day , i believe that a small @entity9 troop presence in @entity10 could have effectively advised the @entity10 military on how to deal with @entity15 's resurgence and the sectarian violence that has engulfed the country , " @entity2 writes in his upcoming autobiography , due out next week			1
president @entity3 announced in october 2011 that virtually all of the 39,000 @entity9 troops would leave @entity10 by the end of that year			1
@entity3 had said that it was a fulfillment to his 2008 campaign promise to bring troops in @entity10 home			1
but at the same time , talks to get the @entity25 , which provided immunity from prosecution to those troops , were at a standstill due to the internal politics of @entity10			2
@entity2 , who said he argued behind the scenes and publicly for a small amount of troops to be left for additional training for @entity10 's military , was frustrated with @entity6 negotiations on the deal			1
under secretary of defense @entity38 led the administration 's efforts in the heated debate			2
" those on our side viewed the @entity6 as so eager to rid itself of @entity10 that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests , " he said in excerpts of the book released by @entity45			2
he writes that his views were shared by other military commanders in the region and the @entity59 but he believes that the commander - in - chief could have done more			1
" officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if @entity64 and @entity65 could reach one , but without the president 's active advocacy , @entity67 was allowed to slip away			0
the deal never materialized , " writes @entity2			0
president @entity3 told @entity72 's " @entity71 " that former @entity10 prime minister @entity67 had " squandered " the opportunity to be a thriving democracy with a strong military because he " was much more interested in consolidating his @entity77 base and very suspicious of the @entity78 and the @entity79 " than creating a united government			1
the president said that sending @entity9 troops back into @entity10 is not the solution			1
" we can not do this for them , because it 's not just a military problem it 's a political problem , " he said on sunday			0
" and if we make the mistake of simply sending @entity9 troops back in , we can maintain peace for a while			1
but unless there is a change in how , not just @entity10 , but countries like @entity92 and some of the other countries in the region , think about what political accommodation means			0
think about what tolerance means			0
" but @entity2 worries that in the meantime the deterioration of @entity10 's security has potentially wiped out gains in the fight against terrorism			2
" the news from @entity10 bothered me to no end			0
in my view , the @entity109 offensive in 2014 greatly increases the risk that @entity10 will become @entity15 's next safe haven			2
that is exactly what it had in @entity116 pre- 9/11 , " he writes			0
" after all we have done to decimate @entity15 's senior leadership and its core , those efforts will be for naught if we allow it to rebuild a base of operations in the @entity125			0
" @entity2 served as secretary of defense from 2011 until 2013			1
he returned to his role as director at the @entity129 , which he founded with his wife in 1997			0
his new book , " @entity132 " is due out october 7th			0
@entity2 : should have armed @entity92 rebels sooner			0

*fmr* . defense secretary @entity2 says @entity3 should have left troops in @entity10
@entity2 says other military commanders shared his views
despite this , @entity2 says @entity9 troops should not be sent back to @entity10
@entity2 served as @entity3 's secretary of defense from 2011 until 2013
