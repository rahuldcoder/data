who does n't like a new look ? @entity4 , new you , amiright ? an updated ' do can " hair - ald " a new phase in your life , signifying a fresh start			2
and maybe that 's what the reclusive leader of @entity11 was going for when he modified his almost boyish over-the - top - flop to a higher , angular , more severe cut			1
the look first debuted at his @entity4 's address in january			1
after all , @entity17 -- following in the footsteps of his father , @entity20 , dear leader and eternal chief of the @entity23 -- is cracking down			1
a resolution he read at the meeting of the party 's @entity26 on wednesday reminded party organizations that they must " wage an all - party intensive campaign against abuse of power , bureaucratism , irregularities and corruption , " according to the state - run @entity36			1
@entity20 's new image got attention on social media , with some asking -- tongue in cheek -- if the new hairstyle was a nod to his father and grandfather			1
" @entity17 has an amazing new haircut			1
we have many , many questions , " @entity47 wrote on @entity48			2
others jumped in to share their feelings on the fade			2
" the @entity55 haircut goes drastically wrong as it reaches @entity11 , " tweeted @entity53			2
some commented on the new shape of the style			0
" @entity17 shows off new trapezoidal hair style , tiny eyebrows , " said @entity59 the resolution read by @entity20 at the meeting also called on party organizations to " conduct the organizational and political work in a fresh and viable manner so that the officials , party members and working people may turn out as one with the revolutionary faith , fighting spirit and revolutionary pluck to devotedly carry out the teachings of @entity20 and the party 's policies under any condition			1
" speaking of " pluck " -- @entity20 's eyebrows also apparently had a brush with the scissors , or tweezers			0
recent photos show a much - abbreviated set atop a face that looks a little larger			0
maybe the smaller eyebrows make it seem that way			0
but surely the 30 - something leader of one of the most closed - off countries in the world has more important things to do than to worry himself with such superficial matters			0
like coming up with some more patriotic slogans to mark the 70th anniversary of the isolated regime 's founding this year			0
some of the more colorful so far : " let us turn ours into a country of mushrooms ! " ( presumably not a reference to @entity20 's old hairstyle ) or " more stylish school uniforms ... for our dear children ! " it 's not clear if the dear children will be urged to emulate their dear leader 's new ' do			0
@entity1 's @entity108 and @entity109 contributed to this report			0
