@entity0 -- at a time when our nation 's top university is more diverse than ever before , @entity3 's recent decision to honor its former professor @entity4 on friday for setting up an undergraduate research fund in his name comes as a big , disappointing surprise			1
the spotlight is finally shining on @entity4 , editor - in - chief of @entity13 , and his history of racist comments against @entity16 , latinos , blacks and others			1
here is the latest blog - post calumny : " @entity16 life is cheap , most notably to @entity16 " and " i wonder whether i need honor these people and pretend that they are worthy of the privileges of the @entity26 , which i have in my gut the sense that they will abuse			1
" i and other @entity16 - @entity30 are accustomed to @entity4 's outlandish statements			1
but i felt betrayed that my alma mater would choose to honor someone with such views			1
i studied the @entity35 and the civil rights movement in @entity3 's libraries			1
i learned about morality and tolerance from its professors			0
i felt accepted in its cosmopolitan student body			0
this decision to honor @entity4 harks back to a chapter of @entity3 's and @entity46 's history that we as a nation have wisely chosen to move past			1
despite the voices raised against it , the university just reaffirmed its decision to recognize him -- although it appears he will no longer speak at the gathering -- citing @entity4 's apology			2
in fact , his carefully worded response to @entity59 columnist @entity58 's criticism merely apologizes for his " embarrassing " remarks on the @entity26			2
to add salt to the wound , he adds that @entity16 life being cheap " is a statement of fact , not value			1
" this comes in the wake of his series of shockingly ignorant comments that have galvanized student groups on campus to protest @entity3 's decision to honor him			1
an example : in discussing @entity77 - @entity46 relations , @entity4 wrote of " latin society with all of its characteristic deficiencies : congenital corruption , authoritarian government , anarchic politics , near - tropical work habits , stifling social mores , catholic dogma ... and increasingly violent modes of conflict			2
" in another display of ignorance , he claimed " so many in the black population are afflicted by cultural deficiencies			0
" ironically , @entity3 cites @entity4 's right to free speech as a justification for recognizing a man who says millions of @entity16 - @entity30 are not worthy of the privilege			1
but the free speech defense appears to be obfuscation , diverting our attention from what is most troubling about this affair			0
as @entity108 , who began mobilizing @entity3 students to respond , explained to me : " the university lends legitimacy and gives a platform to his racist views by honoring him at this prestigious celebration			1
" the @entity3 platform for @entity4 gives racism an intellectual cast and authority and that is a very dangerous thing			1
when groups like the @entity119 espouse bigoted views , they are more easily dismissed			2
but when @entity3 chooses to distinguish a man who cloaks his prejudice in intellectual jargon , and then gives him additional credibility by choosing to recognize him out of thousands of its distinguished alumni , it makes scholarship a haven for prejudice			1
@entity4 contends that certain qualities exist in cultures that do n't , in reality , and moreover he claims that these things are innate , a method of sophisticated racism that has existed wherever hatred has manifested itself -- most painfully during @entity137			2
remember , not too long ago , even in @entity46 universities , disciplines from biology to psychology justified the inferiority of women , blacks , and @entity30			0
@entity3 would be wise to move forward and not backward			2
when a prominent intellectual promotes such racist ideology , it makes such views more palatable			0
many people find it difficult to recognize that educated people can hold ignorant views , and it is even more difficult to challenge such scholarly authority			0
indeed , @entity4 's elite background and lofty connections had several people mitigating his recent comments on @entity16 as an " oversimplification " instead of what it really is : untrue and odious			1
and the timing of the tribute to someone who rationalizes racism could n't have been more dismal			0
during the past holy month of @entity165 , we saw an outpouring of intolerance toward @entity168 , from the ground zero mosque protests to the acts of vandalism and threats against mosques around the country that continue to this day			0
i do n't think the majority of @entity30 hate their @entity16 neighbors , but when a group is being ostracized , it is easy to just be thankful it 's not you			2
but note that this mentality has always left an aching wound in our past			0
last month , conscious individuals like @entity187 mayor @entity186 restored vision to many @entity30 ' blind eye , but someone who has a history of doing the opposite is being honored instead			0
the unintended consequence of @entity4 's recent comment is that it situates @entity195 within the larger context of racism at large			2
as his diversely racist comments indicate , hatred is rarely faithful to one group			0
the @entity4 affair is a small aftershock of the racial and religious tensions that have shaken our nation over the past couple of months			0
its silver lining is that it has mobilized hundreds of students from different backgrounds to unite against bigotry -- something we can all learn from			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

@entity217 : @entity3 is honoring @entity4 , who said " @entity16 life is cheap "
she says she feels betrayed that alma mater would honor man who espouses such views
as @entity227 prof and @entity13 's editor , @entity4 lends legitimacy to bigotry , she says
to honor him , she says , lends credibility to all his *derogatory* remarks about many groups
