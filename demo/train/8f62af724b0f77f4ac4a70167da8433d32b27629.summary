-- world no. 1 @entity1 is looking forward to renewing his " special " tennis rivalry with @entity4 in the semifinals of the @entity7 event in @entity8 on friday			1
the duo , who have won 110 @entity11 titles between them , will meet on @entity14 soil for the first time since 2005 -- which was also the last year they clashed at the last - four stage of a tournament , the @entity20			1
@entity1 battled past @entity23 seventh seed @entity21 in thursday 's second quarterfinal after no. 3 @entity4 received easy passage when @entity27 @entity26 retired with a neck injury while 3 - 0 down in the opening set			1
@entity1 was beaten by @entity4 in five sets in the 2005 @entity8 final , having stunned the @entity32 as a 17 - year - old in the third round of the same event the previous year			1
since then @entity1 has won 13 of their 20 clashes -- 12 of them in finals			2
" very few times we 've played in the semifinals of a tournament			2
the rest of the matches are finals and important for big titles , " the @entity42 told the @entity11 website			0
@entity49 tips @entity50 to fight back " it 's always special to play against him and have these matches , very important matches for both of our careers : finals of @entity20 , finals of @entity60 , of @entity61 , a lot of finals in masters 1000s			2
" that makes the rivalry very , very special			0
i do n't know if rivals in the rest of the history of tennis played as many matches as we 've played			0
" @entity1 will go into the showdown troubled by a worrying problem in his right arm , which affected his movement in the 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 3 win over last year 's runner - up @entity21 -- who he also beat in the 2010 @entity60 final			1
" first time in my life i felt something like this , it 's really strange			2
especially since the left arm i could do aggressive movements , but the right was really strange			0
seriously , i could n't understand during the match what happened , " the two - time @entity8 runner - up said			1
@entity4 , also the 2006 champion at @entity92 , has a 5 - 2 advantage over @entity1 in hard - court events			1
" i think in the beginning , early on in my career when i became the world no. 1 , i did n't really have that rival , and i was very happy about it , " the 16 - time grand slam champion said			1
tired @entity101 crashes out in @entity8 " i was just able to win , win , win , and dominate and go on and lose , you know , 10 matches in two years kind of thing			2
so in the beginning i guess i struggled to embrace the rivalry i had with @entity1			2
" only later on i was able to say , ' this is actually quite cool			0
' @entity111 , pirate pants , you name it -- long hair , lefty , spins , more with the flat shots and so forth , and double - handed against one - handed , lefty against righty			2
i think it all kind of made sense , and i was able to embrace it then			0
" i think we had some good times in the past , and they have changed into what it is today			0
really respectful and helping each other for good causes , foundation matches , you name it , for tsunamis			0
we 've done so many things together			0
it 's been a lot of fun			0
" the winner of the @entity139 tie is likely to face a player who is threatening to end their dominance of the men 's game , @entity145			1
the @entity146 is unbeaten in 22 matches this year , and defeated both icons on his way to victory at @entity152 last time out			0
his semifinal win over @entity4 in the @entity157 desert lifted him to second in the rankings , and he will be seeking his second @entity8 title if he can beat new @entity14 no. 1 @entity161 for the sixth successive time in friday 's opening semifinal			1
in the women 's event , two - time runner - up @entity164 will play 2009 champion @entity168 in saturday 's final			1
@entity164 , who will return to the top - 10 for the first time since 2009 following her recent run of good results , avenged her @entity61 defeat by @entity174 's @entity173			1
the @entity175 triumphed 3 - 6 6 - 0 6 - 2 , winning 11 games in a row after losing the first set			0
" i 'm really happy i 'm back in the finals here , " the 2005 and 2006 losing finalist said of her first @entity8 outing in four years			1
" i 'm almost lucky to be here			0
i had a tough one the other night and another three - setter today			0
@entity173 has been playing the best tennis of her career and beat some good players here , so i was really happy i was able to change things around after losing the first set			0
" eighth seed @entity168 of @entity190 followed up her win over defending champion @entity101 with a 6 - 3 6 - 3 win over @entity193 that ended the @entity175 's hopes of reclaiming the no. 2 ranking from the @entity196 this weekend			1
@entity168 reached her 12th career @entity199 final , and will be seeking her sixth title .			2
