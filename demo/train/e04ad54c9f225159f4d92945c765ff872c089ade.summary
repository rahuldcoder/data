-- bored of diving among the usual coral reefs and tropical fish ? looking for something a little out of the ordinary ? ever thought about diving in a crack between two continents in some of the clearest water on @entity10 ? or what about swimming up to an active volcano ? perhaps underwater art is more your thing ? if so , take a look at some of the most unusual , mysterious and awe - inspiring underwater landscapes from around the world			1
@entity21 rift in @entity22 the only place in the world where you can swim between two continents , the @entity24 fissure in @entity22 's @entity25 is where the @entity31 and @entity32 tectonic plates meet			1
not only can you dive in a crack in the earth caused by the two continental plates slowly moving away from each other ( at an average of 2 cm a year ) , the waters are so clear that many divers are said to lose all sense of depth and even experience vertigo			1
the water 's extreme clarity is thanks to year - round cold temperatures of around two to four degrees @entity48 and the water 's purity			2
the water originates from a glacier high on @entity22 's @entity53 and is filtered through layers of porous lava rock before reaching the national park			1
not only is it cold and clear , the water is so pure it is safe enough to drink			2
the three sections of the dive include @entity61 , the @entity62 and @entity24 lagoon			1
mysterious ruins in @entity64 a long - lost civilization , the work of aliens or simply a natural wonder ? the mysterious underwater ruins of @entity70 continue to lure the most intrepid of divers			1
located in the @entity74 off the westernmost point of @entity64 , the tiny island of @entity70 is remote and difficult to reach			2
but it remains popular thanks to the archaeological riddle submerged off its southern coast			2
exactly how the underwater pyramid structure , known as the @entity70 monument , was formed is still under debate			1
some claim the ruins to be evidence of a long lost city , while others are convinced it is a geological phenomenon			0
there are even a few who believe the site to be the work of architecturally - ambitious aliens			0
whatever its origin , it 's an impressive site			0
estimated to be between 5,000 and 8,000 years old , the stepped structures -- with smooth platform steps and right angles -- appear as though they were carved out of the rock			0
this is not a diving site for beginners , with the ruins located in open waters with high waves and strong currents			0
volcanic action in @entity109 want to see a volcano up close without the threat of lava flows and toxic air ? if so , the submerged volcano of @entity115 is the place to head			0
located beside the island of @entity119 , part of the volcanic island chain of @entity122 in @entity109 , @entity117 rises more than 400 meters from the sea floor and is less than five meters below the water 's surface			0
there is no risk from lava -- instead , the underwater volcano releases ribbons of silver bubbles -- sulfur gas -- escaping deep from inside the earth 's crust			1
" the bubbles can burn your fingers if you 're not careful , " said @entity135 , managing director of @entity136 , which charters one of the few boats that makes the journey to the volcano			0
" if you bring ( the gas ) up in a bottle to the surface it smells horrible , but if the bubbles come up to the surface it smells like nothing , " he added			0
the further you descend , the volcano 's barren sulfur - covered rocks give way to coral reefs and an extraordinary display of marine life , including huge barrel sponges , black tipped reef sharks and schools of neon fusiliers			1
" if the sky is cloudy and the sun is not bright , the atmosphere is quite mystic " said @entity135 , " sometime you can also hear the roaring of the volcano			0
" underwater art in @entity172 want a bit of culture on your next dive ? then try the tropical blue waters of @entity178 , @entity172 where you will find the @entity179 consisting of more than 403 permanent life - sized sculptures , the art - filled sea - bed is one of the largest artificial reef attractions in the world			1
the work of @entity188 sculptor and scuba diver @entity189 , each sculpture is individually cast and made using a special cement mix to encourage coral growth			0
" it 's incredibly interesting working underwater , " said @entity189			1
" the colors are different , the light patterns are very different , the atmosphere and mood is otherworldly			0
" the piece takes on a very different tone underwater -- it has a lost feel to it and brings up all these questions that you would n't have on land , " he continued			1
underwater cemetery in the @entity206 a little over five kilometers off the coast of @entity208 , @entity209 , is an altogether different , and slightly creepy , diving experience -- an artificial reef that doubles as a cemetery			1
the @entity213 , with its tagline " creating life after life , " is a man - made reef , built to encourage the growth of marine life while creating " the ultimate ' @entity219 ' opportunity			1
" people who choose the reef as their final resting place are first cremated			2
their remains are then mixed with non-porous cement , sand and water , and molded into a stone shape of their choosing , such as a shell or starfish			0
the stone is then added to the reef by scuba divers			2
the first phase of the memorial has been built in the style of a " classical re-creation of the @entity240			0
" relatives of the deceased , curious scuba - divers and marine biologists are among those who dive among the coral - encrusted arches and statues of lions that line the sea floor			2
when completed , the memorial will cover have the capacity to hold the cremated remains of around 100,000 people .			0
