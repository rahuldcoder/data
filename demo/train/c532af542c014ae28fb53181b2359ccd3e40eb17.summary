and then there 's @entity5 's commute			1
the 56 - year - old @entity7 man walks 21 miles every weekday as part of his journey to and from the factory where he works			1
" i never thought anything i did would garner this much attention , " @entity5 said			1
@entity5 takes the bus some of the way , but for the past decade , ever since his car broke down , he has trudged the better part of a marathon each workday			1
rain , snow or shine			0
after reading about @entity5 's commute in a @entity27 article from over the weekend , college student @entity24 was moved			1
like @entity5 , the 19 - year - old lives and works in two counties , so he spends a great deal of time commuting himself			1
but @entity24 has a car			2
@entity24 decided to set up an online fundraiser to buy @entity5 a new car			1
" my first car cost $ 3,000 , " @entity24 said , " so i set the goal at $ 5,000			2
within an hour , we 'd raised $ 2,000			0
" @entity24 's fundraiser on @entity40 has blown past its original goal , reaching more than $ 257,000 by tuesday evening			0
@entity5 , in a video message posted on the @entity27 website , gave thanks			1
" everybody calls me the inspiration , but to those who have been great enough to donate and everything ... it was really so welcome that i do n't know what to tell you , " he said			0
" you guys are the heroes			0
" comments on the page from people donating money suggested that the story of @entity5 's dedication to getting to work had tapped into a deep well of public feeling			1
" thank you for inspiring me and hopefully tons of other people to persevere in the face of adversity , " said a contributor by the name of @entity63			0
" you are a true @entity68 hero			0
" " we could use more men like @entity5 in this world , " wrote a donor named @entity70			1
@entity74 identifies with the strangers ' words of support			0
he first spotted @entity5 during his own work commute a year and a half ago			1
" climbing over snow banks , when it was pouring down rain in the summer , " @entity74 said , " whatever the weather , he was there			0
" @entity74 approached @entity5 , who told the financial executive his story			1
@entity74 promised to give him a ride the next time he saw him			0
" two to three months later , i saw him on a corner , " @entity74 remembered , " and i asked if he needed a ride to work			2
" @entity74 estimates he 's given @entity5 between 40 and 50 rides since then , and the two men from vastly different worlds have formed an unlikely friendship			1
the pleasure , @entity74 said , has been all his			0
" i 'm the lucky one , " @entity74 said			0
" driving him around is n't a chore , it 's a reward			0
" @entity74 said @entity5 is inspirational and funny , adding that his work ethic puts anyone to shame			1
" i set our attendance standard by this man , " @entity99 , plant manager at the engineering factory , told the newspaper			2
" i say , if this man can get here , walking all those miles through snow and rain , well i 'll tell you , i have people in @entity112 10 minutes away and they say they ca n't get here -- bull ! " @entity5 apparently has a perfect attendance record			1
he earns $ 10.55 an hour , not enough to save up to buy , insure and operate a car in the city , according to the newspaper			1
with the online donations now topping $ 200,000 , @entity5 , @entity74 and @entity24 met together for the first time monday night			1
the overwhelming support has extended beyond money -- and several car dealerships have offered to give him a vehicle outright			2
" now that [ the effort ] is so big , there 's so much more to think about , " @entity24 said			0
there are , unfortunately , people who want to take advantage of @entity5 's newfound celebrity and his generosity , @entity74 said			2
he put together a team that includes an attorney from a large law firm in @entity135 , a @entity136 and a certified financial planner that he says will ensure the donation money is handled appropriately and in a way that best serves @entity5			2
" this money that is being given to him -- he earned every penny of it , " @entity24 said , just by his work ethic and his attitude			0
he 's been making the arduous 21 - mile journey from @entity7 to @entity146 since his 1988 @entity147 gave up on him			1
the donations mean that @entity5 's mode of transportation will likely soon be changing , and without the long commute , he 'll probably be getting a lot more sleep			1
but he loves where he works , so he has no plans to change much else			0
" i ca n't imagine not working , " @entity5 said			2
" it 's what i 've always done			0
" @entity5 , in his message , said he never expected as much support as he has received			2
he encouraged people to look out for one another			0
" if this story will touch at least one person and inspire them to do something out of the goodness of their heart , i will be the happiest person alive , " he said			0
