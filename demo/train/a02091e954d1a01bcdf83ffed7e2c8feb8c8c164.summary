editor 's note : rep. @entity2 is a @entity3 from the 4th district of @entity5 and is his party 's ranking member on the @entity8			1
rep. @entity2 said @entity9 pay too much for health care due to waste , lawsuits and fraud			1
@entity14 ( @entity15 ) -- @entity9 want , deserve and demand health care reform			1
wednesday , i and my @entity3 colleagues in the @entity19 are unveiling common sense health care reforms that focus on increasing the affordability , accessibility and availability of quality health care			1
our plan will lower costs , make health care more convenient for patients and improve quality at a price our country can afford			1
our chief concern is making health care affordable for all @entity9			1
to do so , we believe in reforming before spending			0
the system now is so complex and unwieldy that billions of dollars are wasted every year			0
in fact , @entity9 pay more for their health care per person than anyone else in the world ; twice what the @entity42 do and two - and - a - half times what the @entity46 spend			1
to lower health care costs , we must 1 ) weed out the rampant overspending in our current system that is driven by the twin forces of trial lawyers and fraudsters , 2 ) modernize medical regulations that have n't been changed in decades , and 3 ) make sure the government is helping every @entity9 get insurance , not just those who have health insurance through their job			1
attacking the unnecessary costs in our current system starts with implementing comprehensive medical liability reform , so when doctors are in exam rooms they are thinking about their patients , not about ordering more tests in case somebody tries to sue later			0
this will reduce the practice of defensive medicine and save billions of dollars in wasted health care spending			2
we also must demand greater oversight and fraud prevention in @entity77 -- the nation 's health care programs for the seniors , the poor and the disabled			1
abuse is so rampant in these programs that the chief counsel to the @entity86 inspector general said , " building a @entity77 fraud scam is far safer than dealing in crack or dealing in stolen cars , and it 's far more lucrative			0
" malpractice reform and fraud prevention are a good start , but just a start			0
we will build on those successes by accelerating the move toward an electronic record system , minimizing the numerous administrative requirements at doctor offices , hospitals and insurance companies			0
by doing so , we can tackle the mountain of repetitive and unnecessary paperwork that clogs our system , drives up costs and creates headaches for patients and doctors alike			0
it is also time to allow states , small businesses and other organizations to increase their purchasing power by banding together to offer health insurance at lower cost			2
a small business in @entity116 might not be able to afford health insurance on its own , but when joining with dozens of other small employers in @entity5 and @entity121 , the pool gets bigger and the price gets lower			0
even with these reforms , the cost of health care is still too high for many @entity9			1
the federal government has a patchwork of subsidies for those buying health insurance that is full of inequities			0
while we are waiting for the cost of our plan to be determined by the @entity133 , we already know it would be cheaper than other alternatives being discussed			0
to help address the inequities , our plan gives @entity9 who purchase insurance on their own a tax deduction , treating them more like those who get insurance through a job or who are self - employed			2
and we create incentives for all @entity9 to save now for future and long - term health care needs by improving health savings accounts and flexible spending arrangements and creating new tax benefits to offset the costs of long - term care premiums			1
republicans also provide financial assistance through new refundable and advanceable tax credits to those who need it most : low - and modest - income @entity9			2
and , especially in today 's economy where so many workers have been forced to retire early or have been laid off , we recognize that many @entity9 who have not yet hit retirement age often have an especially hard time finding affordable health insurance			2
thus , we offer additional financial help to those ages 55 to 64			0
we also recognize that many @entity9 with pre-existing conditions find insurance is either unaffordable or unavailable			2
our plan addresses this by fostering innovative state reinsurance programs and improved high - risk pools , ensuring that high - risk individuals get affordable coverage			0
these and other measures will ensure every @entity9 , regardless of income , regardless of where they choose to live , regardless of pre-existing conditions or past illness , will have access to affordable , quality health care			1
@entity3 stand ready to work with the president and our @entity179 colleagues in @entity180 to improve the affordability , accessibility and availability of health care in this nation			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0
