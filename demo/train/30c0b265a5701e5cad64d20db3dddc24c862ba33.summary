@entity0 -- within hours of president @entity4 's announcement that @entity5 had been killed , politics entered the fray			2
a small but vocal group of @entity8 including former @entity10 administration officials began claiming that information obtained from waterboarding and other now - prohibited enhanced interrogation techniques led to the successful assault on @entity5 's compound in @entity16			1
debate rages about role of torture interviews and commentaries by conservatives , including former vice president @entity23 repeated the contention , citing media reports rather than direct information			1
a closer look shows no obvious evidence of a direct connection , at least to waterboarding , the simulated drowning technique considered to be torture under international law			1
while administration officials , former interrogators and others concede that thousands of pieces of information collected over the past nine years eventually brought @entity40 to @entity5 , no one has cited specific information that came from the harsh interrogations labeled torture			1
that does n't stop defenders of enhanced interrogations from trying			2
@entity8 rep. @entity47 , the chairman of the @entity48 , said that waterboarding alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity50 caused him to eventually provide information on the @entity53 courier killed with @entity5 in the raid			1
was @entity5 's killing legal ? @entity50 was captured in 2003 , and another high - value suspect , @entity56 , was captured in 2005			1
" i think it 's fair to say that it 's a long way to getting @entity5 , but the first step along that road began with the intense interrogation " of @entity50 and @entity56 , @entity47 said			0
however , as @entity1 senior political analyst @entity64 reported wednesday , @entity63 operatives already knew the courier 's nickname when they interrogated @entity50 and @entity67			0
according to @entity64 's report , the detainee who initially provided the courier 's nickname may have been subjected to harsh interrogation , but not waterboarding			1
later , @entity50 lied to his interrogators about the courier , who was described as his protege , and intelligence personnel concluded that the courier was important because @entity50 was trying to cover for him , a senior @entity73 official said			0
@entity73 intelligence eventually uncovered the courier 's identity four years ago " from a different part of the world , " the senior @entity73 official said			1
trail to @entity5 started with courier @entity47 argued that @entity50 only talked after being waterboarded , and even though he lied about the courier , the fact he talked at all showed the value of waterboarding			1
to deputy national security adviser @entity91 , no such connection exists			0
" this whole idea about somehow whether @entity93 ( enhanced interrogation techniques ) played into that , i think , is just not consistent with the facts , and , also , a little bit of a sideshow , as far as i 'm concerned , " @entity91 said			0
@entity100 press secretary @entity99 told reporters wednesday that locating @entity5 required years of painstaking work that eventually led to discovery of the address of the @entity16 compound last august			1
" i can say with certainty that no single piece of information , with the exception of the address of the compound , was ... singularly vital to this , because we 're talking about tiny bits of information that were compiled by unbelievably competent professionals over nine and a half years , " @entity99 said			2
" and it 's impossible to know if one piece of information came from one source and was corroborated in another way ; if , you know which thread held the cloth together , with the exception of the location of the compound			0
" @entity99 acknowledged that some information came from terrorism detainees , which he called one of many ways that information was gathered			0
" now , i ca n't categorically rule out that one piece of information " played a key role , " because we do n't know , " @entity99 said			0
@entity136 , a former interrogator at the @entity137 , @entity138 , terrorist detention facility , rejected claims that enhanced interrogation techniques led to @entity5 's capture			0
" i think some people are trying to rewrite history here , " @entity142 told @entity143 , adding that he was privy to information from @entity50 and was n't aware " of any substantive information or intelligence that was a derivative product of waterboarding			2
" one of @entity4 's first acts as president was to halt waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques of the @entity10 administration			1
the issue was one of the most contentious of the @entity10 presidency , with critics accusing the administration of legalizing torture while supporters called the enhanced interrogations necessary for combating terrorism			1
now , those who were under fire for the interrogation policies are claiming vindication and calling for their return			2
@entity167 , a @entity10 administration lawyer who wrote the memo justifying the enhanced techniques , said in a posting monday on the @entity171 website that the policy had worked			1
however , his posting only cited media reports based on anonymous sources , rather than any specific information gleaned from interrogated detainees			0
@entity178 , a visiting fellow at the @entity179 , made similar assertions on the group 's website , but began his commentary by attributing his information to news reports			0
@entity23 , interviewed on @entity186 and @entity187 , said he assumed enhanced interrogation techniques played a role in @entity5 's demise , but added he had no proof			0
former secretary of state @entity192 said that information was key to the fight against terrorism			0
" now let 's remember that in the early days , we knew very little about how @entity53 operated and the roundup of their field generals like @entity50 led us not just to learn that there was a courier -- i remember when they learned there was a courier who might be a link to @entity5 -- but we also learned from those people about the structure of @entity53 , " @entity202 said			0
however , @entity210 sen. @entity209 , who chairs the @entity211 , said she was unaware of any information eventually leading to @entity5 's location that " came as a result of harsh interrogation practices			1
" two conservative senators -- republicans @entity217 of @entity219 and @entity220 of @entity221 -- also rejected the claim that waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation played a role in finding @entity5			2
" this idea -- we caught @entity5 because of waterboarding -- i think is a misstatement , " @entity220 said , citing instead the years of difficult intelligence work			1
" i do not believe this is a time to celebrate waterboarding			2
i believe this is a time to celebrate hard work			0
" @entity1 's @entity64 contributed to this story .			0
