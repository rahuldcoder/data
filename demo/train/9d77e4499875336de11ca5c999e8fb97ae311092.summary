@entity0 -- @entity7 and @entity4 negotiators have agreed to extend the current @entity9 cease - fire by 24 hours , @entity2 , the @entity4 ambassador to @entity5 , said monday			1
an @entity7 government official confirmed the extension to @entity1			1
the cease - fire is now set to expire at midnight tuesday ( 5 p.m. et )			0
the extension gives negotiators more time to talk about the issues for a lasting peace in @entity9			1
" there has n't been any progress at all , " @entity16 , the lead @entity4 negotiator , told reporters			1
@entity7 and @entity4 media had reported monday afternoon that a deal was set to be signed			1
@entity7 's @entity23 , quoting @entity4 sources , said the agreement would include the easing of @entity9 border restrictions and enlargement of the fishing zone off the @entity9 coast			1
bigger issues -- including demilitarization , the building of a seaport , the release of @entity4 prisoners and the return of the bodies of two @entity7 soldiers -- will be discussed at fresh talks in a month 's time , @entity23 said			1
@entity4 news agency @entity42 reported that @entity5 consultants were drawing up the documents and that @entity7 's delegation had left @entity0 to discuss the deal with @entity7 's @entity48			1
" we hope that every minute in the next 24 hours will be used so we can reach an agreement or the cycle of violence will continue , " @entity16 said			0
@entity54 , leader of the @entity55 , blamed the @entity7 for blocking the path to an agreement			2
he said from @entity9 after returning from @entity0 that the @entity4 delegation was united			1
he told @entity1 by phone that the situation is " very fragile and very explosive			1
" communicating through @entity5 intermediaries , @entity7 and the @entity61 have been trying to resolve in days issues that have smoldered for decades			2
@entity7 prime minister @entity64 said earlier monday that @entity7 was " prepared for any scenario , " with the @entity65 ready " for a very firm action if fire is resumed			2
" @entity7 forces remain positioned around @entity9			2
in recent weeks , they carried out aerial and ground assaults against @entity72 to try to stop militant rocket fire and destroy a network of more than 30 tunnels that extended under the border into @entity7			2
@entity77 not over @entity7 is calling for @entity9 to be demilitarized , demanding that @entity72 , which controls the territory , lay down its arms			2
after meeting with defense minister @entity80 on monday , @entity64 reiterated that @entity7 negotiators had been " instructed to insist firmly on @entity7 's security needs			1
" the strength of the @entity7 military and the @entity7 people 's patience and perseverance would help bring them peace and security , he said			1
@entity80 said @entity77 was not over			0
" we are getting ready for the results of the deliberations in @entity0 , whether they bring quiet or someone tries to challenge us by escalation , " he said			2
" the @entity65 is ready and willing to react with power to any development			0
@entity72 will not drag us to a war of attrition , and if they try , they will get back twice as much			0
" disarmament ? a senior @entity7 official told @entity1 that the most central issue on the table was nonviolence			1
" on the basis on nonviolence , if you assume that includes no tunnels , then you would be correct			0
if you assume that would mean no missiles , then you would be correct , " he said			0
the official said the @entity4 delegation was not united and that @entity72 political leader @entity116 was calling the shots in @entity0			1
he pointed to what he said appeared were contradictions coming from the @entity4 side , asking , " how can @entity7 have full security while they 're still digging terror tunnels and making rockets ? " the @entity61 , he said " ca n't cherry pick what they want			1
" even during the cease - fire , @entity72 has boasted that its rocket - making factories are still operating , replenishing its arsenal			0
but in the view of @entity4 officials , disarmament is a nonstarter			2
" that is not possible , " @entity4 official @entity135 said			1
" because @entity7 will not demilitarize either , will not even commit itself that it will never use military arms against @entity9			0
" @entity72 leader @entity138 said the group 's weapons were " for self - defense " against @entity7			1
" but when we have our own @entity4 state with its own national army to protect its citizens , there will be no need for any party to carry any kind of weapons , " he said			0
' impossible demands ' speaking on condition of anonymity monday , a @entity72 leader said the @entity7 had " submitted impossible demands on the @entity61 such as the issue @entity4 demilitarization , destroying the tunnels and the issue of preventing @entity61 from developing their missiles technology			1
" the @entity7 , he said , " want everything and want to give nothing			0
" he said the @entity61 had responded with a counterproposal offering @entity7 " full security in exchange of full opening of border crossings " or lifting the siege completely			2
@entity61 say @entity7 's blockade is suffocating the economy of the small , impoverished strip of land and the lives of its inhabitants			1
among their demands are the rebuilding and reopening of @entity9 's airport and the establishment of a seaport			0
but @entity7 authorities -- who retain control of @entity9 's airspace , @entity186 waters and their shared border -- say that releasing their grip on what goes into and out of the territory is too risky , as things stand			2
" building a seaport or an airport in @entity9 without demilitarization is like getting a duty - free for rockets and missiles , " @entity7 intelligence minister @entity192 said			0
death toll passes 2,000 meanwhile , the total number of @entity61 killed since the start of the offensive has reached 2,016 , @entity199 , spokesman for the @entity200 in @entity9 , said monday			0
the latest deaths include people who were found under rubble and those who died from injuries they received during the previous fighting			0
it 's unclear how many of the dead were militants			0
the @entity213 has estimated that about 70 % were civilians , but @entity7 has estimated a higher number of militants			0
@entity7 blames @entity72 for civilian deaths , saying militants fire rockets from civilian areas and encourage people to stay despite @entity7 warnings of impending attacks			0
the @entity7 military says 64 of its soldiers have been killed , as well as three civilians in @entity7			0
@entity1 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
