the moment 18 - year - old @entity2 pvt. @entity1 arrived at @entity3 in 1968 , he knew there was something different about the place			1
" it just did not look like a military base , more like a hospital , " recalled @entity1 , a @entity7 native			1
@entity1 had volunteered for a two - month assignment at @entity3 , in @entity12 , lured by three - day weekends closer to home			1
" it was like a plum assignment , " @entity1 said			1
" the idea was they would test new @entity2 field jackets , clothing , weapons and things of that nature , but no mention of drugs or chemicals			2
" but when he went to fill out paperwork the morning after his arrival , the base personnel were wearing white lab coats , and @entity1 said he had second thoughts			2
an officer took him aside			0
" he said , ' you volunteered for this			0
you 're going to do it			0
if you do n't , you 're going to jail			0
you 're going to @entity38 either way -- before or after , ' " @entity1 said recently			2
from 1955 to 1975 , military researchers at @entity3 were using not only animals but human subjects to test a witches ' brew of drugs and chemicals			2
they ranged from potentially lethal nerve gases like @entity47 and sarin to incapacitating agents like @entity50			1
read the secret ( now unclassified ) @entity2 document revealing @entity50 tests on soldiers ( @entity55 ) the military also tested tear gas , barbiturates , tranquilizers , narcotics and hallucinogens like @entity62			1
read the confidential ( now unclassified ) @entity2 document uncovering lsd tests on volunteers ( @entity55 ) this top secret @entity67 research program initially looked for ways to defend against a chemical or biological attack by the @entity71 , thought to be far ahead of the @entity72 in " psycho - chemical " warfare			1
but the research expanded into offensive chemical weapons , including one that could , according to one @entity2 film obtained by @entity79 , deliver a " veritable chemical ambush " against an enemy			1
" this incapacitating agent would be dispersed by standard munitions , and the agent would enter the building through all nonprotected openings , " the film 's narrator boasts			0
president @entity89 ended research into offensive chemical weapons in 1969 , and the military no longer uses human subjects in research on chemical agents , said a spokesman for @entity97 , as the facility is known now			1
tests began for @entity1 almost as soon as he arrived at @entity3 for a two - month assignment on january 1 , 1968			2
" sometimes it was an injection			0
other times it was a pill , " @entity1 told @entity79 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity102			1
@entity1 said he did n't know what drugs he was getting			2
" a lot of chemicals were referred to as agent one or agent two			0
" some weeks , he would undergo one test ; other weeks , more , @entity1 said			2
and when he questioned the staff about whether he was in any danger , they reassured him : " there is nothing here that could ever harm you			0
" but @entity1 , 63 , believes the chemical agents he received during his two - month stint at @entity3 did harm him , triggering health problems that continue to plague him four decades later			1
even when he talks about @entity3 , he said , " i get a tightness in my chest			0
" @entity124 's symptoms days before his @entity3 duty ended , in february 1968 , @entity1 was hospitalized for days with @entity124 's - like tremors , symptoms he said have followed him on and off throughout his adult life			1
from @entity3 , @entity1 said he went to an army installation in @entity130 , where he experienced tremors so severe , he had to be admitted to the base hospital and given muscle relaxers			2
the @entity2 then sent @entity1 to @entity134 bases in @entity135 , in support of the war effort in @entity38			1
he was told never to talk about his experiences at @entity3 and to forget about everything he ever did , said or heard at the @entity12 base			0
@entity1 left the service when his three - year tour ended , and he began a career as a real estate agent			2
he married @entity145 , a nurse , in 1977 , but the couple decided not to have children , fearing his chemical exposure might somehow affect them			0
in his mid- 50s , @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity124 , a progressive neurological condition that forced him to retire early			1
medications cost $ 2,000 a month , which he was paying for out of pocket			0
@entity1 applied for veterans benefits based on chemical exposure at @entity3			1
last year , the @entity155 granted him partial benefits for his @entity124 's for @entity158 exposure during his time in @entity135 , giving @entity1 40 % disability			1
the letter granting him benefits made no mention of @entity3			0
@entity1 says he now takes two dozen pills daily			2
his symptoms vary from day to day			0
sometimes , he has trouble swallowing			0
other times , he experiences numbness in his joints or or tremors			0
he says he tires easily			0
he blames his time at @entity3 for all this , and he has joined a lawsuit on behalf of @entity3 veterans seeking medical benefits from the @entity155			1
read the lawsuit complaint document ( @entity55 ) read about an @entity3 volunteer 's widow who blames the va for his death @entity180 , lead attorney in the suit , has reviewed the partial @entity3 medical records that @entity1 was able to obtain with the help of his wife			1
@entity180 said @entity1 probably received an injection of sarin or another nerve gas , because the records show that he received the drug @entity189 on february 1 , 1968 , to treat " organophosphate poisoning			2
" during experiments that began on february 19 , 1968 , @entity1 experienced @entity124 's - like tremors after receiving @entity194 , an antipsychotic medication , @entity180 said , prompting the @entity3 medical staff to give the young soldier @entity198 and @entity199 , two drugs used to treat @entity124 's symptoms			1
@entity180 said he sees a connection between @entity204 ' parkinson 's disease and the drugs he received at @entity3			0
" those substances affect the same region of the brain , " @entity180 said			0
" @entity1 clearly had adverse health effects because they gave him such high doses that he ranged from overdose with one substance to the antidote , back and forth , and he actually had to get ... a very powerful antipsychotic drug because , in the vernacular , he flipped out			1
" in addition to medical benefits , the lawsuit is asking that the @entity219 and @entity220 find all @entity3 veterans and provide them with details of the chemicals they received and their possible health effects			1
@entity180 said the government has reached very few of the 7,000 or so @entity3 veterans , and the @entity155 has turned down almost all @entity3 - related health claims			1
court documents show that the @entity230 rejected 84 of 86 health claims related to chemical or biological exposure			1
" the whole thing stinks , and if the @entity72 people knew about it , they would not tolerate it			0
this kind of behavior toward our veterans would not be allowed to happen , " @entity180 said			0
@entity1 has not received any health benefits related to his time as a human test subject at @entity3			1
" they 're hoping we die off , so you apply [ for benefits ] , you get turned down , " @entity1 said			2
" and it just goes on for years and years , and they just want to wear us down			0
they want to use young men as guinea pigs and throw them away			0
" the @entity219 and @entity155 declined face - to - face interviews with @entity79 , citing pending litigation			2
in a statement , the @entity219 said that it " has made it a priority to identify all service members exposed to chemical and biological substances ... and the @entity155 has contacted and offered free medical evaluations to thousands of veterans			1
" @entity1 received his letter from the @entity155 in 2008 , four decades after he arrived at the @entity12 base			1
" in order to best serve veterans and their families , @entity155 continues to study the possibility of long - term health effects associated with in - service exposure to chemical and biological weapons , " the letter promised			1
at the @entity2 's request , @entity276 , an independent nonprofit organization that is the health arm of the @entity278 , produced a three - volume report in the 1980s on the long - term health of @entity3 veterans			1
the @entity283 decided in the end there was n't enough information to reach " definitive conclusions			0
" @entity1 enlisted in the military fresh out of high school -- at the height of the @entity291			2
" i really felt a duty to my country to go and serve , " he said			0
" things were different back then			0
you believed in your government			0
and you just would n't think they would give you something that would harm you intentionally			0
