hours before the top diplomats from his nation and the @entity4 begin a high - stakes meeting , @entity1 president @entity0 took to the @entity6 to argue against military intervention in @entity8 and jab his @entity4 counterpart			1
using an op - ed " to speak directly to the @entity4 people and their political leaders ... at a time of insufficient communication between our societies , " @entity0 made a case much like @entity4 president @entity12 did tuesday night -- although their arguments could hardly have been more different			1
striking @entity8 would have many negative ramifications , @entity0 argued in a piece that went online wednesday night , including the killing of innocent people , spreading violence around the @entity25 , clouding diplomatic efforts to address @entity28 's nuclear crisis and resolve the @entity31 - @entity30 conflict and " unleash ( ing ) a new wave of terrorism			1
" moreover , the @entity1 leader said such action without the @entity40 's approval " would constitute an act of aggression			2
" " it could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance , " @entity0 said			0
contrast this to @entity12 's assertion that failing to act in @entity8 opens the door to more chemical weapons attacks in @entity8 and in other nations -- as well as among terrorist groups -- by giving the impression that the international community wo n't act in the face of blatant violations on bans of their use			1
and whereas the @entity4 president blamed the august 21 sarin gas attack that @entity4 officials estimate killed 1,400 people squarely on @entity8 president @entity61 , @entity0 wrote " there is every reason to believe it was used not by the @entity8 army , but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons , who would be siding with the fundamentalists			1
" calling @entity8 's ongoing civil war an " internal conflict , fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition , " @entity0 cautioned against siding with an opposition in @entity8 he says includes " more than enough ( al ) @entity76 fighters and extremists of all stripes			1
" ( he did not mention the fact @entity1 has long supplied arms to @entity8 's government , or that @entity4 officials have said they are funneling aid only to members of what they call the " moderate opposition			1
" ) the @entity1 president ended his op - ed -- just after mentioning a " growing trust " between him and his @entity4 counterpart -- with a swipe at a remark @entity12 made tuesday contending that " with modest effort and risk , we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run			1
" " i believe we should act , " @entity12 said then			0
" that 's what makes @entity4 different			2
that 's what makes us exceptional			0
with humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth			0
" @entity0 challenged the statement , saying , " it is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional , whatever the motivation			0
" " we are all different , " the @entity1 leader concluded , " but when we ask for the @entity113 's blessings , we must not forget that @entity114 created us equal			2
" reacting to that remark and @entity0 's op - ed generally , a senior @entity118 official said wednesday night " that 's all irrelevant			1
" " he 's fully invested in @entity8 's ( chemical weapons ) disarmament and that 's potentially better than a military strike , which would deter and degrade but would n't get rid of all the chemical weapons , " the official said			1
" ( @entity0 ) now owns this , " the official added of the @entity1 plan to have @entity8 's leadership give up its chemical weapons			1
" he has fully asserted ownership of it , and he needs to deliver			0
" all eyes turn to @entity4 - @entity1 talks in @entity135 @entity0 's piece went online around the time @entity4 secretary of state @entity137 headed to @entity135 , @entity138 , to meet with @entity1 foreign minister @entity139			1
their two days of talks will revolve around a @entity143 proposal to avert a @entity4 - led strike in @entity8 by having the @entity8 government put its chemical weapons stockpile under international control			1
in his speech tuesday , @entity12 said he was willing to test the seriousness and feasibility of the initiative before resuming his push for congressional authorization for military action , which at the moment appears unlikely to succeed			0
@entity137 is taking the lead in dealing with the @entity1			1
that includes regular conversations with @entity139 , including wednesday when the two talked by phone about " their shared objective of having a substantive discussion about the mechanics of identifying , verifying and ultimately destroying @entity61 's chemical weapons , " said a senior @entity166 official			2
" it 's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed , and any agreement must verify that the @entity61 regime keeps its commitments , " @entity12 said in his prime - time address to a war - weary public skeptical of another military venture in the @entity25			0
" but this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force , particularly because @entity1 is one of @entity61 's strongest allies			1
" @entity1 officials have submitted a plan to the @entity4 , @entity1 's @entity185 news agency reported wednesday , citing a @entity1 diplomatic source			1
yet @entity118 spokesman @entity189 said that while conversations have taken place , he was unaware of a full , formal proposal			0
" i think we 're not at the stage of putting down public pieces of paper , " he said			0
@entity197 , @entity1 's emissary to the @entity198 , said the plan calls for @entity8 's chemical weapons to be placed under international supervision -- inside that country initially , at least			1
" the ultimate aim is to have these weapons destroyed , " @entity197 told @entity204 's @entity203			0
he acknowledged the task of gaining control of the weapons and destroying them with a civil war raging in @entity8 wo n't be easy , voicing worries about what rebel fighters might do			2
separately , the @entity4 , @entity215 , and @entity216 discussed a @entity40 draft resolution , according to a spokesman for @entity216 prime minister @entity219			0
how long will window be open ? ambassadors from the @entity40 's five permanent members -- the @entity4 , @entity1 , @entity225 , @entity216 and @entity215 -- met the same day for less than an hour , a diplomat with knowledge of the meeting said			1
while the focus now is on @entity138 , @entity40 headquarters in @entity229 is expected to become the focal point early next week when @entity40 chemical weapons inspectors deliver their report to the @entity40 -- as early as monday or tuesday , sources say -- on the august 21 attack in @entity8			1
in @entity236 , the debate about what the @entity4 should do in @entity8 is not over			2
while @entity12 has said he wants to give the diplomatic process a chance , he has n't said how long he 'll wait before possibly pushing again for military action			0
after his meeting earlier this week with @entity243 , sen. @entity241 said the president asked lawmakers " for some time to work things out -- a matter of days into next week			0
" another @entity243 @entity248 , though , said it could take weeks to determine if diplomatic efforts will pan out			0
members of @entity252 will watch @entity137 's trip closely for a sense of @entity12 's next move after weeks of beating the drum for military action against @entity8			1
" if diplomacy fails , he 's painted himself into a corner , " sen. @entity258 said after @entity12 's speech			0
" the leader of the free world ca n't say all these things at the end of the day and do nothing			0
" senior @entity166 officials have cautioned that negotiations over the proposed deal may not conclude after the scheduled round of talks in @entity135			0
the plan would be to take any final deal to the @entity40 to be formalized in a resolution			0
outcome far from certain while that process unfolds -- if it does successfully -- @entity12 continued to keep the door open for military action , despite exhortations from @entity0 that he drop any hint of a threat			0
the @entity4 president has said any military operation in @entity8 would be targeted , limited and not involve @entity4 ground forces			2
its goal would be to degrade @entity61 's ability to use chemical weapons			0
@entity12 has also said any strike would be effective -- saying tuesday that " the @entity4 military does n't do pinpricks " -- and he has ordered armed forces to be poised in the region " to keep the pressure on @entity61			2
" @entity4 - funded ( if not @entity4 - made ) weapons began flowing to @entity8 rebels about two weeks ago , a @entity4 official said			1
coordinated by the @entity297 , the supplies include light weapons , ammunition and anti-tank weapons in addition to nonlethal aid the @entity4 has long been providing			2
a big question looming over the diplomatic talks is whether any @entity40 resolution includes a potential for military action should @entity61 not cooperate			0
that 's something the @entity4 and its allies have favored , while @entity0 has said his country could veto any measure there that contains such a threat			1
@entity204 poll : part of @entity8 strike opposition is the messenger 's fault analysts say @entity137 , as leader of the @entity4 diplomatic efforts , has his work cut out for him			1
" i think it 's unlikely the @entity1 government is going to relent on this issue of whether or not it would support the use of force in a security council resolution , " said @entity322 , a former senior @entity166 official now at @entity324 's @entity323			2
" they 've been consistent since day one of the @entity8 crisis that they did not want to see the @entity4 or anyone else use force			2
i think that 's one of the ambitions the @entity1 have going into this negotiation in @entity135 , " he added			2
@entity12 makes case : opinion former secretary of state @entity343 said in an exclusive interview on @entity204 's " the lead with @entity347 " that @entity137 must not take the threat of force off the table in his talks with the @entity1 even if they insist he drop it			1
" this is the way that diplomacy works			0
you use the threat of the use of force to get some action in diplomacy , and then diplomacy just to figure out what you do about the threat of the use of force , " said @entity343 , who served as @entity4 's top diplomat under president @entity357			2
" one of the things i know from trying to get @entity40 resolutions is that they take a while , " said @entity343			0
" but my personal feeling here is that it is that threat of the use of force , and the president made very clear that our ships would stay in the area , and that the use of force would stay on the table			0

@entity0 's op - ed is " irrelevant " and he " needs to deliver " on @entity8 , @entity4 official says
@entity4 - funded weapons began reaching @entity8 rebels 2 weeks ago , official says
in a @entity6 op - ed , @entity0 says striking @entity8 will hurt the region and world
