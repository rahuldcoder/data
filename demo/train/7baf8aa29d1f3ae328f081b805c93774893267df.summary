in a much - anticipated report , the @entity0 has concluded that chemical weapons have been used in the @entity4 conflict			1
experts investigated seven instances of alleged use and found that chemical weapons were either used , or likely used , in five of those instances			1
the case that was most clear to inspectors was an august incident near the capital , @entity14			1
" the @entity16 collected clear and convincing evidence that chemical weapons were used also against civilians , including children , on a relatively large scale in the @entity23 area of @entity14 on 21 august 2013 , " read the 82 - page report , which was released on thursday			1
blood and urine samples from patients there tested positive for sarin and sarin signatures , it found			1
anti-government activist groups say more than 1,300 people were killed in the attack in @entity23 -- many of them women and children			1
graphic video footage showed rows of bodies without apparent injury , as well as people suffering convulsions or apparently struggling to breathe			1
@entity0 inspectors also said they collected credible information , or evidence consistent with the probable use of chemical weapons , in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
they were unable to corroborate the allegation that chemical weapons were used in either @entity53 or @entity54			1
the report did not specify whether the government or opposition groups were responsible for the alleged attacks , which happened between march and august this year			1
the @entity0 estimates that more than 100,000 people overall have died since the @entity4 conflict began in march 2011			1
it began with a government crackdown on peaceful protesters during the @entity64 movement , then slowly spiraled into a bloody , full - blown civil war			1
rebel leader denies he fled also thursday , a top @entity4 rebel commander denied that he had abandoned his post and said he is working to resolve fighting among opposition groups in the country 's north			1
in the meantime , a decision by the @entity74 and @entity75 to halt nonlethal aid makes sense , said @entity79 , chief of staff of the @entity80			2
several @entity74 administration officials had said that the fate of @entity79 , a top rebel commander supported by the @entity83 , was uncertain as conflicts persisted between the @entity80 and @entity86 groups			2
@entity79 denied reports that he fled to a @entity89 state after the @entity90 allegedly seized a warehouse held by the @entity80			2
he did leave @entity4 , but is working at his office on the @entity94 border and has not left his job , @entity79 told @entity96			2
in this case , he was already in @entity94 when the attack on the warehouse happened , he said			2
on wednesday , @entity94 sealed its border with @entity4 because of the fighting between opposition groups in @entity4			2
in the past two days , @entity79 has been talking with different groups and has tried to resolve their differences , he said			2
" the situation in the north of @entity4 now is very complicated and very dangerous because there are some problems between some groups , and i think we will try and we should try everything now to find a solution for this problem , " he said			2
the @entity90 , which announced its formation last month , is an alliance that includes tens of thousands of fighters from some of @entity4 's most powerful @entity86 groups , including @entity118 , @entity119 , the @entity120 and the @entity121			0
the groups control territory in key areas across @entity4 and have been fighting forces loyal to president @entity126 along the critical lines of @entity14 and @entity128 , among other places			0
the front 's formation has diminished the stature of the @entity133 - backed @entity80 and its leadership abroad , the @entity135 , as leaders inside the country have sought to distance themselves from a command structure criticized for failing to serve the opposition 's needs on the ground			1
' infighting is growing ' the seizure of the warehouse this week could prove key in shaping how the @entity74 deals with the @entity4 opposition			0
" the @entity4 opposition has never been a unified fighting force but infighting is growing and , naturally , this is hindering cooperation on the battlefield , " said one @entity74 official			0
" at least temporarily , there will be more turbulence within the opposition as the new groups that have cropped up compete for power			0
what is n't clear yet is whether the various factions will refocus attention on toppling @entity126 or become embroiled in internecine fighting that would play to the regime 's advantage			0
" according to @entity79 , the @entity90 fighters did not take over the warehouse , but attacked a @entity80 battalion that was protecting it and took its inventory			0
it was unclear which group gave the orders to attack the battalion , he said			0
the inventory that was inside the warehouse -- which was not @entity74 aid , @entity79 said -- is in good shape and will hopefully be returned			0
@entity79 admitted that he does n't fully trust the @entity86 , but that an agreement must be reached to control the fighting and form a single command			0
the fighting among these groups opposed to @entity126 led the @entity74 and @entity75 to suspend nonlethal aid to the rebel groups			0
" it is very difficult now to pass the support to the right hands			0
and that 's why i can understand the , let me say , freezing the support for a period of time , " @entity79 said			0
the @entity186 of the @entity80 called the allegations that @entity79 had abandoned his post rumors			0
" such rumors only serve to impact on the morale of our brothers fighting on the ground at a time when we need to concentrate on stopping the criminal regime , which continues to perpetrate horrific massacres all over the country against our people , " the council said in a statement .			0
