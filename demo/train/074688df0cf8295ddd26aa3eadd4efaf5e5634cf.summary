abramovich triumphant he has led the west @entity45 side to the @entity46 and finally fulfilled the ambitions of the club 's @entity49 owner @entity48 in lifting @entity52 's top club prize			0
@entity48 has ploughed an estimated $ 1 billion into buying the players to turn @entity4 into a @entity55 power since buying the club in 2003 and gone through eight managers in that time , but the closest he had come to the @entity6 was a penalty shoot out loss to @entity60 in 2008			1
in the end , it was temporary option @entity39 who delivered the famous trophy , and despite also guiding the team to @entity46 glory , the @entity67 coach must wait to find out if he will be appointed on a permanent basis			0

threatening @entity5 playing in front of a crowd of 66,000 , @entity5 had always been the more threatening side throughout the match without carving out a string of clear cut chances			1
their best opportunities in the first half saw a shot from @entity29 deflected on to his own woodwork by @entity20 while @entity5 's top scorer @entity114 fired over just before the interval			2
@entity117 's effort , pushed aside by @entity15 , was the sole @entity4 effort of note			2

it looked all over for @entity4 but their never say die attitude , so evident in the semifinal win over @entity74 , came to the fore again			1
winning their first corner with only two minutes of normal time remaining , @entity17 's perfect delivery was met by @entity1 to head home at the near post			1
it was his 34th goal in the @entity6 and surely never more crucial			2

@entity29 , playing against his old club , stepped up after a considerable delay and his weak effort was saved by @entity20			0
@entity124 's replacement @entity22 wasted another glorious opportunity in the second half of extra time , caught in two minds after a @entity162 cross			0
it summed up a frustrating night for @entity5 and their coach @entity164 , who said they paid for their failure to kill off @entity4			1
" we missed too many chances , " @entity164 told @entity166			0
" we played well overall and had the majority of possession			0
