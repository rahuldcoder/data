all of this is necessary , he says , to explain his theories not just about cooking but about creativity writ large			2
" here you will eat knowledge , " says the great chef of his @entity14			1
more like a physicist or philosopher than a chef , @entity8 says he 's come up with a " theory of everything " -- a model to unlock creativity in any walk of life			1
@entity37 in the kitchen " this is not about cooking			0
it 's about creativity , " he says , speaking through a translator while walking through the building that will house his new operation , an abandoned textile factory , in @entity0 , home to great @entity49 innovators such as architect @entity50 and surrealist paint @entity37			1
the @entity14 will spawn a research laboratory , @entity9 ( an online encyclopedia of food ) and massive open online courses to teach gastronomy and creativity			1

he believes @entity9 will become the most disruptive @entity63 venture since @entity64			1

" it 's his way of recognizing his collaborators , some of who have gone on to create their own great restaurants			0
" we have thought many times that we are crazy , " he says			0
" if that is so then we must be changing many things			0
" with the passion of the self - taught , @entity8 speaks with his hands as much as his mouth , kneading the air as if it were pastry , pinching fingers together to make points as if adding salt			1
it 's all in the recipe any business , skill or art can be improved with a touch of @entity9 magic , he suggests			1
" the aim of this project is to show people they can be creative ... to be creative about any process , " says @entity8 , waving his arms so vigorously you 're glad he 's not wielding a kitchen knife			1

he was hired to the kitchen staff of @entity9 restaurant at 22 , working in the little restaurant on the beach at @entity109 on the @entity110 north of @entity0			2
rising to head chef , he was recognized as an innovator , leading @entity9 to a record five wins in the " world 's best restaurant " awards			1
a pioneer in molecular gastronomy , @entity8 liberated new tastes and developed new methods such as nitrogen - infused foams			1
despite holding three @entity124 stars -- menu items included frozen whisky sour candy and tobacco - flavored blackberries -- @entity9 closed in july 2011			2
during a two - hour tour of his enormous new space , @entity8 explains the creative force that drove him to lead the world 's best restaurant , only to close it after 25 years			1
a polymath and control freak , @entity8 's new kitchen of ideas features hundreds of meters of foam pinboards with ideas big and small sketched on them			1
there 's also a scale model of the huge visitor center he plans for the coast next to the now - closed @entity9 restaurant			1
articles about @entity148 founder @entity147 are pinned to one board			0
another has diagrams of cuts of meat from a pig			0
truffle ice cream a sprawling library houses every recipe ever cooked at @entity9 and an archive of food and recipes going back to the 15th century			2
" in 1768 there was black truffle ice cream , " says the man who created liquid olives			0
" if you think i do crazy things , that 's even more amazing			0
the things that were done many years ago were so far ahead of their time			0
" @entity8 is planning what he says will be the first exhibition of its kind about the creative process , set for an october opening at @entity180 exhibition space in @entity181			1
the " @entity186 © todo @entity185 ­ fico " will be an examination of the scientific methods behind @entity9			2
at the center of the exhibition is a @entity189 , a sort of astrological chart outlining the process that takes an idea through trial and error to finished product			1
" everything is in the map , " he says , explaining how the broad chart can provide the answer to almost anything			0
@entity8 is free with his advice and major institutions around the world seek his input			2
he lectures at the @entity206			0
it 's how he tells ' em some of his truisms may sound so simple as to be half - baked , but there 's a driving force behind his seeming madness : deconstruct everything			0
a few beauties from the @entity216 : " a fried egg is chemistry			0
" " eating with chopsticks is more sensual so we made ( @entity9 ) chopsticks			2
" " people ask me how i get my ideas ... if you go to the toilet with a magazine you are thinking			0
" critics have called his food pretentious , even dangerous to consume			0
but the fans of haute cuisine love him			0
the big question , of course , is when is @entity8 going to cook again ? his answer will disappoint many			2
@entity8 says he turned away two million potential reservations for @entity9 in its final year			1
