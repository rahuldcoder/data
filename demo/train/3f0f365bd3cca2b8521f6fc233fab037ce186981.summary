@entity0 -- i always thought @entity3 would be a success , but never imagined it would be quite the triumph it has turned out to be			1
from the brilliant opening ceremony to the festival of music and fun closing it , via mainly lovely weather , some epoch - making athletic events , and a home team performance that exceeded even the most optimistic expectations , the @entity6 have given @entity0 two of the most remarkable weeks in a great city 's rich history			1
the question now is where it all goes from here			2
do we look back , as the @entity22 and the @entity23 have done after @entity24 and @entity25 , and say : " well that was wonderful , but it kind of went downhill from there ? " @entity22 's relatively poor performance on the field of play suggests they did n't get the legacy right from @entity24 -- one of the key challenges for @entity0 now -- whilst the @entity23 , at the epicenter of the eurozone crises , remind us the attention of the world will quickly revert to the state of the global economy			1
i remember , on leaving @entity25 eight years ago , hearing both the public and politicians say this was the starting point for a new and better @entity23			1
a lot has gone wrong since			2
even as the @entity49 were celebrating more gold , @entity48 governor sir @entity47 was giving one of the gloomiest gubernatorial assessments of the future i have ever heard			0
and we all know that after a party as fantastic as the one we have had , there is bound to be a hangover to come during the lull before the @entity59 open			0
for the politicians , who have to lead the country through difficult times , capturing the @entity64 mood and turning it into something of positive and lasting significance has now been added to their list of challenges			1
politics , banking , the media and the church are among many parts of national life that have seen their reputations lowered in recent years			1
it has felt at times in the past fortnight that sport is filling some of the gaps			0

they will find it hard to resist demands for more investment in school sport , or tax breaks for sporting clubs and activities , and any number of campaigns backed by a small army of new heroes			0
i hope they take up an idea i proposed some months ago to raise sport to the @entity99 table , not least for the economic and social opportunities it brings			0
yet equally , once life settles back down to something closer to normality , they will find the same pressures from other walks of life too , and the same frighteningly difficult economic sums to add up			0
but they do have to make decisions and they do now , finally , have to seize the opportunity for a proper sports strategy to build on the success of the @entity6 and the joy and fulfillment sport has shown it can bring			1
i had a call today from an athletics club organizer saying he had been inundated by kids and parents wanting to join , but worried he did n't have the capacity to give them what they thought they would be getting			0
but nor should the anti-politics brigade underestimate the role that politics played both in the getting and running of the @entity6 , and in the success of @entity134 has many fathers , and president @entity136 was so right when he said how much more could be achieved if nobody cared who got the credit			1
while huge credit has rightly gone to @entity144 chairman @entity143 and his team , @entity141 's government does deserve credit for setting up the @entity147 which enabled proper investment in elite sport			2
@entity151 's government does deserve credit for increased investment and school sports partnerships ( which the current government was so wrong to cut ) and @entity151 deserves huge credit for the diplomatic skills he used which swung the last few votes for @entity0 against @entity157 to land the @entity6			1

during the opening ceremony , i tweeted that " @entity176 is explaining the @entity177 to @entity178			0
" okay , a bit of a cheap shot			0
but for me the genius of the ceremony lay in capturing not just the greatness of our past , but the insight that , provided we recognize we are now a very different country to what we were , we have the chance for a great future too			2
fast forward several days to the greatest night of all when in less than an hour , a black @entity192 asylum seeker , a mixed - race northerner and a tall , good - looking ginger man won athletics @entity195 , and you could almost hear the nation saying : " this is who we are			0
" the problem with the @entity177 was not the idea but its execution			0
@entity176 did give a more coherent vision of it than the politicians have done , and the @entity6 gave a sense of what it could mean in practice			1
@entity209 setting bold ambitions and finding the team from public and private sector to deliver on them			0
liberating people with expertise to deliver on the specific goals for their part of the project			2
harnessing the energy and support of businesses and people to make it happen			2
it has already led to cultural change and we will see soon enough -- with the start of the football season -- if it has any chance of enduring			0
i have exited hundreds of stadia in my time			0
but the atmosphere coming out of the @entity233 in these last few days has been like no atmosphere i have ever experienced before			0
the first thing you notice is how clean everything is			0
cans , bottles , litter -- they seem to be in bins , not chucked to the ground			0
there are also fewer police officers than you usually see leaving a big event			2
people talk on the tube to strangers			2
read more : @entity64 killjoys left out in the cold ? the volunteers have been the key to all this			0
and they are just having a good time helping others to have a good time			0
there is such a positivity to these games that comes not just from sporting success but the scale of the project and the fact @entity267 pulled it off ; the superb venues and the smoothness of the movement of big crowds through them ; the transport system working well ; the phenomenal support the @entity274 public has given at every single venue			1
but right up there is the role of the @entity279 : mr and mrs @entity267			0
these are the real @entity283 , and they are the antithesis of the negativity of those newspapers which claim to be the voice of the @entity274 people			1
that same positivity is the reason @entity0 mayor @entity291 emerged as one of the political winners of the @entity6			1
when so many people and media were talking down the prospects of things going well , he talked them up			1
by contrast , the government has not managed to tap into the new mood that is so much a part of why these @entity6 have been such a success			1
@entity178 sought to become prime minister on the back of a message about " @entity267			0
" his health secretary @entity305 talks down the @entity306 as a way of justifying reforms that were not voted for and appear unwanted by many who run the service			0
education secretary @entity311 is more at ease criticizing teachers and pupils and talking down success than he is in building it up			2
a year ago , amid the @entity0 riots , people were entitled to wonder if mr @entity178 had a point about @entity267			1
but anyone who has been touched by these @entity6 knows that @entity267 is anything but broken , that the best of @entity274 can in its own way compete with anywhere in the world			1
we have shown it in sport			0
but just think to some of the cultural icons on display at both ends of the @entity6 , from @entity333 to @entity334 , and it is clear we show it there too			1
in their own way , i think these @entity64 could be one of the most significant events of our lifetime			0
they are changing the way @entity274 people think about themselves and about their country			1
we have shown we can do big things well			0
we have shown we can succeed at anything we set our minds to			0
we have changed the way many overseas think about us			2
the challenge for the media , as @entity354 deliberates on their future , is to understand this rejection of relentless negativity and @entity360 faux celebrities is for real			1
the challenge for the politicians is to understand that they too must cut back on the " everything is terrible " narrative , set clear directions and be strategic about how they meet them			1
@entity178 's rushed out statement on school and elite sport over the weekend -- when what is needed is a thought through long - term big scale plan -- was not a good start , but we have seen a new mood emerge			1
the hope now is it can lead to a new media and a new politics too			2
in addition to the millions being inspired to get more active , that would be quite a legacy			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity384 .			1

@entity0 's games have been an *unexpected* triumph , says @entity384
he says challenge will be to build on the @entity6 ' success to create a lasting legacy
@entity384 : event has changed the way @entity274 people think about their country
he says onus is on media , politicians to *continue* new mood of positivity
