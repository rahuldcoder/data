@entity1 , @entity0 -- when people think of coffee , words such as caffeine , aroma and energy may spring to mind			0
' good breath , ' however , certainly is n't one of them			2
@entity13 at work in his ' smell laboratory ' found that coffee can lead to good breath			1
so researchers at @entity18 in @entity19 , were in for a surprise when their study into the relation between coffee and bad breath , showed that coffee can actually lead to good breath			1
breath specialist @entity13 of the university 's @entity26 found that there are certain components in coffee that inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath -- preventing these bacteria from making their presence felt , or smelt			1
" everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath , " @entity13 told @entity2 " and as a latte drinker , i believe that too			1
" but the malodor does n't necessarily come from the coffee itself , said @entity13 : " we think that coffee , which has a dehydrating effect on the mouth , can ferment into bad breath when mixed with substances such as milk			1
" this meant that until recently , coffee was up there with not eating a healthy breakfast , not drinking enough water and consuming alcohol as causes for unpleasant mouth odors			2
but until @entity13 's study , no one had ever scientifically shown the link between the consumption of coffee and bad breath			1
@entity13 's team wanted to prove just that			0
they did the research by taking saliva and incubating it with different brands of coffee including the @entity19 brand @entity67 coffee , @entity71 @entity70 coffee , and @entity72			2
" we thought this coffee and saliva mixture would have a terrible odor , but incredibly it had the opposite effect			0
" @entity13 -- who also created popular mouthwash @entity78 -- is now thinking about creating a mouthwash , toothpaste , or chewing gum based on coffee			1
the effects could be similar to plant extracts such as clove oil , which have also been shown to have anti-bacterial properties that prevent bad breath			2
but first @entity13 would have to find which of the hundreds of components in coffee are the ones that have these beneficial properties			0
" that will take a long time " said @entity13			0
" but this research has already been a lesson in humility , showing that assumptions are not always correct			0
" @entity13 -- who also writes children 's books such as ' @entity101 ' -- told @entity2			0
" and sometimes , getting it wrong can create even more interesting outcomes			0

a new study surprised researchers when it found coffee can lead to good breath
the study in @entity111 , @entity19 , was meant to prove coffee leads to bad breath
the lead researcher is now thinking about creating a coffee - based mouthwash
