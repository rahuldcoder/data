@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's journey " home " ended with a private burial in @entity1 on sunday as questions persist about what caused the superstar 's death			1
a crowd gathered at the entrance to @entity13 in @entity14 , south of @entity0 , where @entity4 's body arrived late sunday morning			1
she was laid to rest next to her father in the cemetery			1
her burial brings an end to her " coming home , " as her family dubbed the invitation - only memorial service held a day earlier at her childhood church in @entity0			1
the family - only burial is in contrast to the emotionally charged , star - studded memorial service held at @entity28 , where @entity4 , nicknamed " @entity4 , " was soloing in the junior choir by age 11			1
" @entity37 " was the last song @entity4 sang in public before her death on february 11 in @entity34 , @entity35 , at the age of 48			1
so it was fitting that the mourners -- comforted and encouraged by the likes of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 -- heard the simple , but powerful , " @entity37 , " this time performed by @entity44			2
the mourners inside the church represented an amalgamation of @entity4 's life , from childhood friends to gospel singers , from music stars to movie stars			1
" you literally felt like this was just a girl from @entity1 who had a few famous friends , and it was such a celebration of life , " @entity2 producer @entity53 , who attended the funeral , said sunday			2
" it is the same church service that will go on in so many churches across the country this morning ... and it was celebration , it was singing , it was praise for three hours			2
" and it was n't until the very end that you remembered that this was a funeral and a very sad day for a lot of people			0
" @entity75 , who cast @entity4 in her first role alongside him in " @entity79 , " recalled how she questioned whether she was good enough , beautiful enough to be cast in the film			1
" it was the burden that made her great and the part that caused her to stumble in the end , " he said			0
for her closest friends inside the church , and strangers who continue to draw inspiration from her voice , @entity75 's words hit a painfully honest note about human frailty			0
years after " @entity79 " hit theaters , reports of @entity4 's struggles with drug addiction and a rocky marriage with @entity100 surfaced and her album sales declined			1
" the inexplicable burden that comes with fame , " @entity75 said			0
i know the famous in the room have had theirs			0
" @entity75 said @entity4 's own story could help a new generation of young girls who dream big			1
" maybe they 're thinking they are n't good enough , " he said			0
" i think @entity4 would tell you : guard your bodies			2
guard the precious miracle of your life			0
then sing your hearts out , knowing that there 's a lady in heaven who 's making @entity127 himself wonder how he created something so perfect			0
" one of the most emotional moments in the service came when keys recalled how @entity4 helped her and others achieve success			1
" she reached back to so many people ; she reached back to me , to @entity140 and @entity141 ... and just made us feel strong and capable and loved , " she said			0
keys ended her tribute to @entity4 by singing " @entity145 , " her voice soaring into the rafters of the sanctuary			2
@entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity1 gov. @entity153 , @entity154 were among those who attended			0
" it was n't until the very last moment that you pinched yourself and said , ' there 's @entity150 with a face full of tears , there 's @entity166 with a face full of tears , " said @entity53 , recalling the moment that @entity4 's casket was carried out of the church			2
" it all really sunk in and got really , really heavy			0
" @entity4 's former husband , @entity100 , also arrived at the service but left soon after			1
@entity100 walked by @entity4 's casket with his head down before the service began and then left			1
@entity100 accused security of treating his family badly and barring him from visiting with his daughter , an account that @entity4 's family denied			1
@entity100 was expected to attend with two guests but showed up with 10 people and sat in a section reserved for family , a close friend of the @entity4 family told @entity2 on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue			1
when @entity100 refused to reseat his entourage to make room for @entity4 's mother , the family asked police to intervene , the family member said			1
mourners heard only a few indirect references to her personal battles			0
a close family friend told @entity2 recently that @entity4 had not used " hard drugs " for several years			1
investigators are examining prescription drugs found in her hotel room			0
at the time of her death , @entity4 was in the @entity209 area for the annual @entity210 and was to attend a party hosted by her longtime mentor and record producer , @entity214			2
she was discovered dead in her hotel suite at the upscale @entity217			0

the source spoke on condition of anonymity citing the ongoing investigation			0
@entity4 's death certificate is only fueling speculation after coroners deferred making a determination as to the cause of death pending the outcome of toxicology tests			2
