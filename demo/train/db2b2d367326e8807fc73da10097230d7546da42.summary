@entity0 -- the @entity3 body responsible for preserving the world 's most important cultural sites voted friday to grant " world heritage " status to the @entity8 in the @entity10 city of @entity11			1
the declaration by @entity13 covers the @entity15 church , venerated by @entity16 as the birthplace of @entity18 , and the surrounding route taken by religious pilgrims			2
it marks the @entity10 ' first bid for inclusion on the prestigious list of sites deemed to hold " outstanding universal value " as part of the world 's shared heritage			1
it comes after @entity10 were granted membership of @entity13 last october , when the body 's general assembly voted overwhelmingly to accept them			1
the vote proved controversial within the @entity36 , which holds the view that @entity10 must reach a peace deal with @entity39 before the @entity40 can be granted full membership in international organizations			1
the @entity36 ' and @entity39 's subsequent funding cut to the body caused @entity13 lose more than a fifth of its revenues			1
rebels burn @entity49 tomb listed as @entity3 world heritage site the declaration , announced in the @entity53 city of @entity54 , was backed by 13 of the body 's 21 members			1
two countries abstained , while six countries voted against the declaration			0
@entity10 foreign minister @entity60 , in @entity54 for the vote , thanked all those who voted in favor of including @entity11 's holiest sites on the world heritage list			1
" the victory of @entity68 in international organizations is the beginning of the end of the @entity39 occupation , " @entity60 said in a statement			0
@entity72 , a member of the @entity74 's executive committee who heads the group 's @entity76 , told @entity1 from @entity78 that the vote affirms the @entity10 identity and is one step toward @entity10 self - determination			2
" now we are responsible for our cultural and historical sites as part of human civilization as a whole , " @entity72 said			0
" politically it is important , because it is the beginning of the loosening of the control of the @entity39 occupation on our land , on our lives , on our culture and at all attempts of confiscation and distortion of our cultural heritage and reality , " @entity72 said			1
@entity39 @entity104 spokesman @entity102 told @entity1 that @entity39 was opposed to the move			2
" this is a real theater of the absurd			1
the @entity10 have stepped over the regular procedure of @entity13 and distorted the usual proceeding in order to vote a decision that has nothing to do with world heritage sites and even less to do with this site , the @entity8 , " he said			1
@entity116 's heritage sites " the only purpose of this unprecedented voting procedure was to turn the commission into a propaganda tool against @entity39			2
this should be denounced by all member countries of @entity13 , otherwise this will not be the @entity10 ' last word			2
" the @entity15 city of @entity11 , about 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) south of @entity0 , is considered the @entity40 ' top visitor destination , largely due to the religious significance of the church			0
one of the oldest surviving @entity132 churches in the world , it drew 2 million visitors last year , according to @entity135 , an architect and head of the research and training unit at @entity11 's @entity139 , which has been lobbying for the site 's designation as a @entity143 destination			2
@entity135 said the center considers @entity11 's inclusion on the list " as a @entity10 dream , and as a reward of 11 years of work in the field of preserving the cultural and natural heritage in @entity68			1
" visitor numbers have hit record highs in recent years but , according to a report into developing tourism in the town , @entity11 has yet to properly capitalize on its potential			0
the majority of the visitors were day - trippers on short visits , meaning the full economic benefits of tourism did not flow into the town			0
@entity165 's heritage sites under threat @entity135 said it is hoped that gaining world heritage status will help efforts to boost @entity11 's appeal as a destination and keep visitors in the town longer			1
" we are mainly seeking to extend the stay of the visitors , who usually drop ( in ) to @entity11 for few hours to visit the church and leave without visiting the town , " she said			0
" we hope that this inscription would contribute to both the promotion of the site and its protection			0
" concerns have been raised over the condition of the church , which has suffered extensive earthquake damage in its long history			0
another issues is that responsibility for its administration is shared among three religious authorities : the @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity194 churches			0
on occasion , tensions among the groups have spilled over into violence ; in december , about 100 @entity191 and @entity192 clerics fought with brooms when a tussle broke out while cleaning the church			0
one of @entity132 's most holy places , the site 's focal point is the @entity205 , a rectangular cavern beneath the church that has been considered the site of @entity18 's birth since at least the 2nd century			0
a 14 - point silver star set into the marble floor marks the precise spot where @entity18 is said to have been born			0
in the 4th century , @entity212 founded a church on the site that was destroyed in the year 529 , only to be replaced by larger structures , which form the basis of the church today			0
@entity13 suspends year - end projects due to @entity36 funding cut			1

the @entity8 in @entity11 is now the first @entity10 world heritage site
the vote signals a loosening of @entity39 control on @entity10 land , a @entity10 *official* says
" this is a real theater of the absurd , " says an @entity39 foreign office spokesman
@entity36 and @entity39 funding to @entity13 was cut over @entity10 membership
