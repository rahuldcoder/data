-- @entity1 insisted on going to high school baseball tryouts , despite his mother 's worries he was n't feeling well			1
after the tryouts , the 15 - year - old complained of leg pain and seemed exhausted			2
he woke up and vomited during the night , @entity8 recalled			0
she gave him medicine for his fever , and he returned to bed , only to wake again , vomiting and complaining of leg pain			0
at the emergency room , doctors diagnosed @entity1 with the flu , and said his leg pain was due to " compartment syndrome , " @entity8 said			1
" because the muscle has no room between the skin and the bone , it causes pressure on the arteries and veins with your bone , and can eventually cut off the circulation , " she said			0
" so if they had not taken him into surgery ... they might have had to amputate his legs			0
" but no one was prepared for what happened next -- @entity1 died on the operating table that day in 2005			1
" what i later found out is that the flu attacks the muscles , and that 's why you feel achy when you get the flu , " his mother said			2
" because he was so healthy , and because of the exertion he had done the night before , it ( the influenza ) went thru his system quicker than it would go through a normal child			2
... the heart is a muscle , and his heart gave out on the table			0
" while @entity1 's complication was uncommon , influenza can produce complications that result in death , including pneumonia , bacterial infection , acute respiratory failure , and encephalitis , even in otherwise healthy children			1
his death has been motivation for his mother to work toward preventing such deaths in other children			0
getting children ready for flu season at the time , @entity8 noted , it was n't recommended that children @entity1 's age get the flu vaccine -- something she worked to change , lobbying the @entity74 's @entity73 to increase flu immunization requirements for children and teens			1
she is now a volunteer with @entity78 , a group run exclusively by families who have experienced the loss of a child or a child who has suffered serious complications from the flu			2
the group receives funding through private donations as well as funding from organizations that include pharmaceutical companies in the form of unrestricted grants			0
new research presented last week shows that healthy children , as well as those with underlying health conditions , are at risk of dying from flu - associated causes			1
the research was presented at @entity98 , the first conference held by a consortium of infectious disease groups			0
it examined deaths among children over the past eight flu seasons			2
between 2004 and 2012 , 829 @entity107 children under 18 died from influenza - associated causes			1
while many of the deaths occurred among children with underlying health conditions , including neurological disorders , asthma or lung disease , and genetic or chromosomal disorders , 40 % occurred among children with no known medical condition , according to lead author dr. @entity118 of the @entity74			0
healthy children actually died more quickly , according to the research , with a median of four days from symptoms to death			1
that 's compared to a median of seven days from symptoms to death among children with a pre-existing condition			0
" because influenza - associated deaths can occur rapidly in children , prevention is really the best defense , " explained @entity129 , noting that over a third of deaths occurred in children younger than age 5 -- a group known to be at high risk -- and 11 % occurred in children younger than 6 months			1
that 's a group that is too young to be vaccinated			0
new research raises hopes in quest to find universal flu vaccine school - based influenza vaccination programs , however , may help prevent the spread of the virus among children and young adults			1
in tandem with the new data on pediatric flu deaths , an example of promising new research on flu prevention was presented at the @entity157 2012 meeting			1
results of a school - based program were presented by dr. @entity160 , an assistant professor of pediatrics at the @entity162 and @entity163			1
" we looked at a proactive approach for how to prevent influenza , " @entity160 said			0
her study followed 4,500 elementary school children in eight schools in @entity170 during the 2010 - 11 flu season			1
@entity172 had a school - based flu vaccination program			1
the schools without a program served as the control group			0
thirty to 50 % of children in the vaccine program schools received a flu vaccine			2
if any child came down with respiratory symptoms or a fever , cough or runny nose , they were tested for influenza			0
the process was done for all schools , @entity160 explained , and included contacting homes of children who were out sick to make sure they were appropriately tested			0
" we found that children who were vaccinated were three times less likely to get the flu and missed half the number of school days compared to children who were not vaccinated , " said @entity160			1
" in our schools that had school - based influenza vaccination programs , their rates of influenza overall at the entire school were lower than at school that did not have any vaccination program			1
and again , also their attendance rates were also much higher than the schools that did not have any vaccination program			0
" @entity210 supplements no help for colds , flu vaccination of school - age children is important , @entity160 said , because " children are very capable of spreading the flu			1
they go to school , they 're in their classrooms , they 're all together -- they touch each other , touch doors , pass around papers and pencils			0
" they also can go home and spread the flu virus to family members including the very young or the elderly , who can become severely ill. the entire community also benefits from school - based immunization programs , she said , as it means less time away from work for parents caring for sick children			1
in addition , parents do n't have to take their children elsewhere for the vaccine if they receive it at school			2
another bonus : " in the school where the vaccination rate was close to 50 % , we see some protection extended even to those kids who were unvaccinated , " she said			2
" their rates of influenza were less compared to schools with lower vaccination rates			2
" there are simple steps that families can take to fight the flu			0
the @entity73 recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older			0
vaccination is critical for people who live with or care for young children or children with medical conditions , to prevent the spread of flu to high - risk children			1
moms can help protect their babies by getting a flu shot during pregnancy			0
and make sure that family members and caregivers -- including babysitters and grandparents -- are all vaccinated to prevent spreading flu to children too young for vaccination			1
while vaccination is the first line of defense , if children do get the flu , prescription antiviral medicines , which include @entity276 ( generic name oseltamivir ) and @entity278 ( zanamivir ) , are recommended by the @entity74 as treatment to help ease symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness , @entity129 said .			2

@entity1 , 15 , was healthy , yet died from influenza complications
new research shows that healthy children are also at risk of such complications
school - based flu vaccination programs may *provide* an important prevention tool
