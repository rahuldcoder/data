-- it feels like a rerun of the @entity3			1
similar to late 2004 when hundreds of thousands of @entity5 took to the streets to protest what they saw as a fraudulent presidential election , mass demonstrations have been taking place ever since the government in @entity12 suspended an association and trade agreement with the @entity15 some days ago			1
no less than back then , observers inside and outside the country are stunned by the civic force unleashed			0
across the country , @entity5 have been gathering for @entity19 , coined after the @entity12 square that is the epicenter of protests now as it was then			1
social networks , independent media and street talk are again abuzz with minute - by - minute news , appeals for nonviolence , help offered to protesters and humor ridiculing the powers that be			0
@entity5 protests grow as president responds @entity5 also pin their anger -- and their hopes -- on largely the same protagonists as nearly a decade ago			1
there is the government of president @entity38 , whose rigged election in 2004 and rejection of the @entity15 accord now , both times with backing from @entity44 , blatantly ignored the will of many @entity5			1
these , in turn , rally behind an opposition led by a motley crew composed of boxing champion @entity49 , nationalists and , from her prison cell , the erstwhile @entity53 icon @entity52			0
and as back then , the government has started to peddle back , and indications now are that the protesters may succeed with their demands			2
yet not all is @entity60 vu , and the stakes now seem even higher than during the @entity3			2
many in @entity5 feel today that they have reached a final junction			2
they do not want to miss what may be the last opportunity in many years to come for a principal , some even say civilizational , choice between @entity69 and @entity44 , democracy and dictatorship , sovereignty and subordination , prosperity and poverty , modernity and mayhem			0
indeed , the contrast between what @entity5 can expect from her @entity81 and @entity82 neighbors could not be starker			2
opinion : beware @entity44 's power play the @entity15 has , over several years , negotiated the most comprehensive association and deep free trade agreements ever , and it is ready to sign these with @entity5			1
they require the country to adopt hundreds of @entity15 laws , regulations and standards , and necessitate much - needed reforms of @entity5 's often dysfunctional political , legal and state institutions			1
in return , the @entity15 would abolish visas for @entity5 citizens and open its common market of 500 million consumers to @entity5 companies , resulting in a considerable boost to the country 's gdp and prosperity			1
while promising to affiliate @entity5 closely with the @entity15 , to reinforce its independence and to benefit its democracy , rule of law and market economy in the long - run , the agreements fall short of a full membership perspective for the country , and they contain very limited assistance to accomplish the painful process of reforms required			1
most importantly , however , the @entity15 has been reluctant to include with its offer short - term support to @entity5 's battered economy and finances			1
@entity44 , on the other hand , has used the dire need of @entity5 for immediate cash injections to promote its own integrationist project , the @entity125			2
this is @entity127 's attempt to bring back former @entity129 republics under the @entity131 's hegemony and to restore its erstwhile status as a world power , and it is to be fully functional by 2015			0
this anti-eu , which currently comprises only @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity44 , does not demand political , economic and social modernization but is content with the same autocratic and oligarchic status quo that @entity44 herself preserves			0
in return , current and would - be members are lured with @entity44 political backing , financial subsidies and security guarantees , while countries opting against are threatened with debilitating sanctions			0
in either case , @entity44 effectively undermines the independence and statehood of its smaller neighbors			0
@entity5 , the largest , most strategic and highly symbolic among @entity44 's neighbors , has experienced this arsenal of @entity44 sticks and carrots for years -- and the more massively , the closer it moved to signing its @entity15 association and trade agreements			1
faced with this choice , the @entity5 government and society have clearly grown apart			2
the former gave in to @entity44 pressures , mainly drawn by the short - term prospect of financial aid offered by @entity166 and only concerned with preserving its political power			0
the latter has increasingly understood that a free , democratic and prosperous @entity5 is possible only in ever closer , and one day full , integration with the @entity15			1
it is this understanding that manifests itself in the demonstrations across the country			0
it is now on the @entity15 to seize the moment			2
it must be no less proactive than it was during the @entity3 and engage the @entity5 government and the protesters in a national dialogue for a way out of the current impasse			1
it must clearly state that @entity5 has a perspective of @entity15 membership as per its own founding documents , and it must ready the same support -- political , financial and institutional -- that it has provided to other new democracies on their way to the @entity15			1
it must mobilize , directly and through the @entity191 , the resources for @entity5 to weather its imminent financial collapse , and it must shield the country from likely @entity44 retaliation , whether economic sanctions , political meddling or worse			0
hundreds of thousands of courageous @entity5 have handed their country , and @entity69 , a second chance			0
it may be the last , and it must not be wasted			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0
