@entity0 -- the tale contains elements of a spy thriller : a soldier in @entity7 's feared @entity6 turns spy for the @entity9 after concluding that the government that had promised democracy had instead ushered in oppression , violence and death			1
but @entity15 says this is no novel			1
in his new book , " a @entity17 to @entity18 : the @entity23 of a @entity9 agent inside the @entity6 of @entity7 , " @entity15 offers a first - hand account of how he turned against the @entity21 regime that he said has oppressed its people for three decades			1
in one of his first public appearances , @entity15 addressed a packed hall friday at the @entity28			1
flanked by a bodyguard and disguised in a hat , mask and glasses , he spoke through a modulator that led @entity35 columnist @entity34 to liken his voice to @entity37 's			1
even his name is a pseudonym , all in an effort to protect his family , friends and contacts , he said			2
the author said that , after a peaceful childhood in @entity7 , he came to the @entity46 in the 1970s for college , studying computer science at the @entity49 , where he enjoyed a carefree life of parties , watching football and listening to @entity53 and @entity54			1
he returned home after the sudden death of his father to find a country embroiled in change			2
@entity15 describes the immediate aftermath of the 1979 revolution against @entity62 as a special time in @entity7			1
@entity7 had been led to believe democracy was theirs , the clergy would n't interfere in their lives and the people would have freedom of speech , assembly and political affiliation , he said			2
everyone was excited about the direction of the country , he said			2
it was then that @entity75 's friend told him about an opportunity with the newly formed , elite @entity6 , which hired him immediately			1
@entity15 said he quickly became disillusioned when he saw people being tortured and murdered and women raped in @entity80 's notorious @entity79			2
repressing his countrymen , he said , was not what he had signed up for			2
but rather than quit the guard and endanger his family , he contacted the @entity9 and began work as an @entity46 agent under the code name " @entity88 , " he said			1
there was no magic watch or pen or fancy car like @entity93 , he said , just a pencil and a notebook			2
he was trained in communications and deciphering codes			0
@entity15 said his role " was to look and act the part of a devout @entity99 enforcing all the new rules laid down by the mullahs			0
" " a full black beard was a mandatory accessory to the guard 's uniform , and i sported one along with every other member of the guards			1
the image of a scowling , black - bearded guard in uniform mustered fear and garnered respect			0
playing the part of a zealot did not come naturally to me , and there were times i had to do things i dreaded : cautioning young girls to cover up , barking at kids for not displaying proper @entity21 behavior , taking on the persona of a fanatic			0
i knew i would have to try to convince myself that doing these things allowed me to maintain my role -- and maintaining my role allowed me to contribute to the downfall of the organization to which i so fervently imitated allegiance			0
" he said he provided critical information to his @entity9 handlers about @entity7 's role in the @entity134 , the @entity135 , the bombing of the @entity137 barracks in @entity138 and the bombing of @entity140 , which he said was masterminded by @entity80			1
@entity15 described a @entity9 that knew little about what was going on inside @entity7 and was complacent about finding out the truth about the regime			1
he said he warned his case officers in the mid- 1980s about the growing danger of the guard , but said @entity46 officials sat idly by , alternating indifference and negotiation with the regime he was working to take down			0
this " misconception " of @entity7 , he said , has plagued @entity46 's decisionmaking for three decades			0
after a few scares in which he thought his cover was blown , @entity15 left @entity7 , was granted asylum in the @entity46 and moved to @entity155			0
he said he no longer works for the @entity9 , but still provides the agency with information from his contacts in @entity7 about the regime , its nuclear program , its terrorist activities in the region and its continued oppression of the @entity7 people			1
he said that , after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2005 election of @entity7 president @entity167 , he decided to speak out publicly to raise awareness of the brutality of the regime			0
he predicted that @entity7 will eventually attack @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity172 and advocated a preemptive military strike against the regime but not against the @entity7 people or infrastructure			0
@entity15 accused the @entity177 administration of naivete and betrayal for seeking to engage @entity7			0
not only does the regime see this as weakness on the part of the @entity46 , he said , but the @entity7 people view it as a betrayal of the highest order as they fight for freedom			0
" stop dreaming , please , " he said friday			0
" you are not dealing with rational people			0
every time you extend a hand , it is not seen as sincerity , but stupidity			0
" the @entity9 's public affairs office in @entity0 was not open friday night and its telephone number would not accept messages ; its e-mail account rejected two attempts to send it a message .			1
