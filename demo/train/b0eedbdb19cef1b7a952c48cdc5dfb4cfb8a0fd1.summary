-- storylines wo n't be lacking entering the final round of golf 's masters			1
you have @entity6 , at 20 trying to become the youngest winner at @entity8			1
@entity9 , 50 , could become the oldest champion at the event			1
sentimental favorite @entity12 -- he of the collapse at the @entity14 more than 10 years ago -- remains in contention and @entity16 , like the other three , wants to bag a maiden major			1
oh , and we should n't forget @entity19 , attempting to win at @entity8 for the second time in three years			1
those are just a few			2
@entity6 and @entity19 share the lead at 5 - under - par 211 , a shot better than @entity24 and @entity16 and two better than @entity9 and @entity25			1
@entity19 had a three - shot advantage after two rounds			1
@entity6 , a @entity6 rookie like @entity24 , has been solid in all three of his rounds rather than spectacular			1
his 1 - under - par 71 on thursday was followed by a 70 friday and another 70 saturday			2
he mixed four birdies with two bogeys in the third round			2
" this is where i wanted to be , " @entity6 told @entity32			1
" it was a huge goal of mine to put myself in the position to contend at a major championship , and the @entity3 sticks out in my head as the one tournament to win in my whole life			0
" " i 'm trying not to think about that , you try to stay level headed on the golf course and so far so good , but i would n't want to be anywhere else right now			0
there is still a quarter of the tournament to go but ultimately it would be a dream come true for me			0
" i 've dreamed of playing here and of winning here so who knows what can happen tomorrow			0
" @entity9 struggled friday with a 76 but was 10 shots better off saturday , thanks in large part to seven birdies			1
if he was to win sunday , @entity9 -- soon to be competing on the @entity59 -- would surpass @entity60 as the oldest titlist at @entity8			1
" if you are 50 , it does n't mean that you can not play well , " @entity9 told reporters			2
" i 'm still moving			0
" i hit the ball longer than ever			0
i 'm not a long hitter necessarily , just a medium hitter			0
but i still play my irons , when i want to play a fade or draw , high or low , it still happens			0
" majors are about patience			0
today i was very patient			0
i have plenty of victories in my career and having a major in my career would be amazing			0
that would be the flower on top			0
" @entity16 would have joined @entity19 and @entity6 atop the leaderboard had he not bogeyed the last hole and @entity12 will be ruing three bogeys in his last six holes , although he trails the leaders by merely three shots			1
@entity19 could n't match his sizzling friday display , when he tallied five straight birdies on the difficult back nine			2
instead he endured a shaky start , bogeying four holes on the front nine			0
he held it together thereafter , dropping another shot only at the 16th as part of his 74			2
" i was pumped up , my shots were going further than i was expecting them to , and the greens got firmer , harder and made it difficult , " @entity19 told @entity32			2
defending champion @entity98 slumped into a tie for 16th following his 76 and was overtaken by , among others , @entity102 @entity101			1
@entity103 matched a @entity105 record by hitting a 30 on the front nine			0
three bogeys and a double bogey , though , on the back nine left him five shots behind @entity6 and @entity19 .			1

@entity6 and fellow @entity102 @entity19 share the lead at the masters
@entity6 is trying to become the youngest ever winner at @entity8
they lead the @entity102 's @entity16 and @entity117 's @entity24 by a shot
@entity120 's @entity9 could become the oldest masters champion
