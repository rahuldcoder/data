@entity0 , @entity1 -- walking through a maze of narrow streets south of @entity6 , @entity3 appeared unfazed by the sight of drastic changes -- traditional courtyard houses that once lined up these hutongs , or alleys , now in different stages of being knocked down			1
@entity3 's underground exploration in @entity0 has attracted the attention of a @entity16 tv crew			1
while the @entity18 area is going through an extreme makeover -- a restoration of its @entity22 flavor ahead of the @entity23 -- @entity3 's destination is safe from the city 's ubiquitous wrecking balls			0
upon reaching the entrance to the @entity28 , however , he was told it was closed for " renovation , " just like the surrounding neighborhood			2
" it 's like they 're trying to literally bury this place before the @entity41 , " said @entity3 , a recent graduate of @entity32 in the @entity33 , with a major in history and @entity37 language			1
this place is a vast network of tunnels built beneath @entity0 's city center during the 1970s in anticipation of a nuclear war with the @entity48			1
covering an area of 85 square kilometers and containing 1,000 anti-air raid structures , the subterranean complex was said to have been mostly hand - dug by 300,000 local residents			0
" the plan was to move half of @entity0 's population underground and the other half to western hills in the event of a nuclear attack , " @entity3 explained			1
the 22 - year - old @entity61 native has lived in @entity1 on and off for a year and is fascinated by the bomb shelter and its history			1
after the authorities opened part of the @entity28 as a tourist attraction to woo foreigners , he turned a routine visit to an adventure in 2006			1
armed with a flashlight , @entity3 veered off from the mandatory guided tour			0
moving sandbags and unchaining doors , he explored the off - limit area and found rooms with bunk beds and decayed cardboard boxes of water purifiers			0
" it 's more than just propaganda posters down there -- it really is a parallel universe , with street signs stenciled on the wall , " @entity3 said			0
since then , @entity3 has discovered other shelters linked to the network -- many of them turned to cheap hostels -- on busy streets			0
not surprisingly , the time - warped part of the @entity28 remains his favorite			2
" i sometimes wish i was born earlier to witness the @entity93 unfold -- and the tunnels have given me a unique vantage point to look into that period of history , " @entity3 said			0
" while @entity0 is transforming itself for the @entity23 , it 's just amazing to see this space in such a sharp contrast to the city aboveground			2
