-- @entity2 officials are claiming that the terrorist group @entity4 in @entity5 and @entity6 , or @entity7 , is " now a credible alternative to @entity9			1
" but what does that really mean in terms of @entity7 ' potential threat to the @entity2 ? after all , @entity9 has n't pulled off a successful attack in the @entity2 since 9/11 , or indeed anywhere in the @entity16 since the @entity18 transportation bombings in 2005			1
this month , sen. @entity23 , @entity24 , criticized the airstrikes in @entity5 ordered by president @entity26 directed at @entity7 as too limited , telling @entity0 's @entity27 , " that is simply a very narrow and focused approach to a problem which is metastasizing as we speak			1
candy , there was a guy a month ago that was in @entity6 , went back to the @entity2 , came back and blew himself up			2
we 're tracking 100 @entity2 who are over there now fighting for @entity7			1
@entity7 is attracting extreme elements from all over the world , much less the @entity36 world			2
and what have we done ? " the case @entity23 alluded to was that of @entity39 , who grew up in @entity40 , @entity41 , and who conducted a suicide bombing in @entity6 in may on behalf of the @entity44 , @entity9 's @entity6 affiliate			2
according to the @entity45 , @entity39 had returned to the @entity2 after being trained by @entity46 and then went back to @entity6 to conduct the suicide operation in which he died			2
@entity23 asserted on @entity0 that 100 @entity2 were fighting with @entity7			1
in fact , according to @entity2 officials , 100 is the total number of @entity2 believed to have fought or attempted to have fought with any of the many @entity6 insurgent groups , some of which are more militant than others , and some of which are even aligned with the @entity2			1
according to a count by the @entity58 , eight people from the @entity2 have been indicted with crimes related to trying to join @entity7 or the @entity44			1
( by contrast , some 240 @entity2 citizens and residents have been indicted or charged with some kind of jihadist terrorist crime since 9/11			2
) some of the @entity44 cases are far from threatening			0
on april 19 , 2013 , @entity66 , an 18 - year - old @entity2 citizen from @entity67 , @entity68 , was arrested and charged with attempting to provide material support to @entity46			2
however , he was caught in a sting operation and described his fighting skills thusly : " concerning my fighting skills , to be honest , i do not have any			0
" @entity66 pleaded not guilty and awaits trial			0
other cases appear more serious			0
in december , @entity75 , a @entity2 citizen from @entity76 , pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to provide material support to @entity9			1
between december 2012 and april 2013 , @entity75 had traveled to @entity6 , where , he stated , he fought alongside the @entity44			0
on his return , @entity75 discussed with an informant his intent to participate further in jihad			0
in august 2013 , @entity83 , a naturalized @entity2 citizen living in @entity84 , was charged with attempting to provide material support to the @entity44 in @entity6 , by facilitating the recruitment of experienced fighters from @entity9 's @entity89 affiliate to @entity6			1
he pleaded guilty last month			0
opinion : how @entity5 's black market in oil funds @entity7 yet so far no @entity2 citizen involved in fighting or supporting the @entity44 or @entity7 has been charged with plotting to conduct an attack inside the @entity2 despite the fact the war in @entity6 is now in its fourth year and the war in @entity5 is in its 11th year			1
indeed , some @entity2 who have traveled to @entity6 have ended up dead apparently because they have no combat experience to speak of ; for instance , @entity100 from @entity101 , @entity102 , was killed in @entity6 last year by forces loyal to the @entity6 dictator @entity105			2
further , @entity7 ' predecessor , @entity9 in @entity5 , never tried to conduct an attack on the @entity2 homeland , although it did bomb three @entity2 hotels in @entity111 in 2005			1
and it 's also worth noting that in none of the successful terrorist attacks in the @entity2 since 9/11 , such as the @entity116 bombings last year or maj. @entity118 's massacre at @entity119 , @entity120 , in 2009 , did any of the convicted or alleged perpetrators receive training overseas			0
returning foreign fighters from the @entity6 conflict pose a far greater threat to @entity126 , which has contributed a much larger number of foreign fighters to the conflict than the @entity2 , including an estimated 700 from @entity130 , 450 from the @entity131 and 270 from @entity132			2
unlike in the @entity2 , @entity126 countries have reported specific terrorist plots tied to returning @entity6 fighters			0
@entity136 , a suspect in the may 24 shootings at a @entity139 museum in @entity140 , @entity141 , that killed four people , spent about a year with jihadist fighters in @entity6 , according to the @entity145 prosecutor in the case			0
but @entity136 's case is the only instance of lethal violence by a returning @entity6 fighter in the @entity16			0
still , the @entity2 must consider @entity126 foreign fighters returning from @entity6 as more than a @entity126 problem because many of those returning are from countries that participate in the @entity2 visa waiver program and can enter the @entity2 without a visa			2
moreover , experienced @entity9 operators are present in @entity6			0
as one senior @entity2 intelligence official put it to us , these are veteran members " with strong resumes and full rolodexes			0
" the wars in @entity6 and @entity5 allow such longtime fighters to interact with members of other @entity9 affiliates			0
for example , in july , the @entity2 adopted enhanced security measures at airports based on intelligence that bomb - makers from @entity172 were sharing their expertise in making bombs capable of evading airport security with members of the @entity6 @entity44			0
despite these dangers , however , the threat to the @entity2 from foreign fighters in @entity6 and @entity5 remains only a potential threat			1
the administration 's airstrikes in @entity5 are properly focused upon the more imminent threats to @entity2 government employees and @entity2 citizens in the @entity187 city of @entity188 who are threatened by @entity7 advances and the humanitarian catastrophe befalling the @entity193 population in areas controlled by the militant forces			1
the last time there was a similar exodus of @entity2 citizens and residents to an overseas holy war was to @entity89 following the @entity2 - backed invasion of @entity89 by @entity203 forces in 2006			0
more than 40 @entity2 subsequently went to @entity89 to fight with @entity204 , an @entity9 - affiliated group			1
opinion : @entity7 beheading -- what should @entity2 do ? just as is the case today in @entity6 , for a good number of the @entity2 who went to fight in @entity89 it was a one - way ticket because 15 of the 40 or so @entity2 volunteers died there either as suicide attackers or on the battlefield			1
in 2011 , rep. @entity215 , @entity217 - @entity216 , then - chairman of the @entity218 , warned of @entity2 fighting in @entity89			0
" with a large group of @entity220 - @entity2 willing to die as ' martyrs ' and a strong operational partnership with @entity9 leaders in @entity224 and in @entity225 , @entity204 now has more capability than ever to strike the @entity2 homeland			1
" as it turned out , those @entity2 who returned from the @entity89 jihad did not attempt or carry out any kind of terrorist attack in the @entity2			0
now @entity215 is back at it again , telling @entity233 last week , " @entity7 is a direct threat to the @entity2			1
... they are more powerful now than @entity9 was on 9/11			0
" @entity7 is surely a major problem for @entity5 , and its tactics and strategy are abhorrent , as demonstrated by the beheading of @entity2 journalist @entity240 , its use of crucifixions and its genocidal attacks on the small @entity193 minority			1
but that does n't mean it is a serious threat to the @entity2 homeland .			2

@entity2 officials now see @entity7 as a credible threat , on a par with @entity9
@entity253 : some *lawmakers* have *exaggerated* the current threat to @entity2 from @entity7
he says the problem is a potential issue , but few have been charged so far
@entity261 : clearly @entity7 is a potent force that must be countered in @entity263
