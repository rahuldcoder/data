@entity1 , @entity0 -- it may look like an air mattress you might see lying around next to a swimming pool but in reality its function could n't be less trivial			2
the @entity9 could play a major role in saving lives in the developing world			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) -- a new portable water purifier -- could be a major step forward in the fight against disease and mortality in the @entity18			1
@entity19 , a @entity20 - based architect and the inventor of the @entity9 believes the product could help eradicate the scourge of polluted water which the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) estimate claims over 1.5 million lives every year			1
not only does it purify water -- up to 20 liters -- it makes it more portable in large quantities -- a vital dual role in @entity32 and parts of @entity34 where access to clean water is often scarce			1
" there are lots of products that do one or the other , " @entity36 told @entity2			2
" there 's a really interesting product that 's been around for 10 or 12 years called the @entity42 -- a 20 gallon drum with a handle attached that allows people -- mostly women -- to transport a week 's worth of water back home "			2
@entity36 also points to another product developed by the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) that has successfully tackled water impurities			2
according to @entity54 ( @entity53 ) is already used by more than two million in over 30 countries			2
" the idea of @entity9 , " he says , " is to combine these two products and make them into something that can do both roles effectively "			1
made out of a top layer of recycled low - density polyethylene ( @entity63 ) and a bottom layer of durable rubberized nylon , the @entity9 is both flexible and robust			1
its design was morphologically inspired by the saguaro cactus and is adaptable to a variety of situations -- as a wrap to carry or placed on the roof of a mud hut -- and is easy to store			1
the @entity9 uses passive solar radiation -- a water sterilizing method approved by @entity25 -- which disrupts the reproduction of microorganisms			1
@entity78 and @entity80 radiation from the sun pass through the @entity63 layer and into the water cavity and are reflected back by the bottom layer of nylon			0
on a sunny day purification takes five hours			0
@entity36 admits that its performance is hampered by its low density -- scratches to the surface mean it does n't transmit the sun 's rays as effectively -- but he is confident that this can be overcome with more research			0
production using a @entity99 equipment may be relatively expensive but @entity36 says that the raw materials are cheap and the labor is inexpensive			0
" we are trying to imagine ways that this thing can be made and repaired by people where it is most needed , " he said			0
" we are working on a sheet welding process which is much lower tech , inexpensive and also capitalizes on the handcraft skills of local people "			0
what started out as a solo effort a little over a year ago has gradually grown into a collaborative project			0
@entity36 's students at the @entity117 , where he currently teaches -- he moves to a new post at @entity120 this fall -- have lent their enthusiasm and experts from the bioscience and textile industries are increasingly coming on board			0
@entity36 's efforts have already been recognized			0
the @entity9 won first prize in the 2008 @entity128 run by @entity129 -- netting him $ 10,000 -- and he is waiting for conformation that the invention has been selected for @entity135 's @entity134 show which takes place in @entity137 later this year			1
so what next for @entity36 and his invention ? the aim is to adapt the original design and turn it from a water carrying wrap into a fully fledged coat and he 's also looking at ways the material might be redrawn as a tent			1
he 's currently in the process of trying to qualify for non-profit status			0
and with the likes of the @entity152 and other institutions out there , he thinks the prospects for funding development and deployment look promising .			0

the @entity9 aims to reduces disease and death
the award - winning design by @entity19 is portable as well as a being a purifier
flexible and robust the design is morphologically inspired by the saguaro cactus
