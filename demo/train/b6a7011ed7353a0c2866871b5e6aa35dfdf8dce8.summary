-- @entity2 's top technology companies have approval ratings that most politicians can only dream of , according to a new poll			1
and @entity7 , not @entity6 , is the ultimate object of our digital affection			1
a robust 82 % of @entity2 have a favorable opinion of @entity7 , and 53 % have " strongly favorable " thoughts about the web titan , according to an @entity16 / @entity15 poll released last last week			1
the reigning king of web search , @entity7 has expanded its empire in the past few years , adding its @entity21 mobile operating system and @entity23 networking site to already popular features like @entity25 and @entity26			2
only 9 % of respondents to the poll , conducted from march 28 - april 1 , held an unfavorable view of @entity7 , while 10 % had no opinion			1
@entity7 's results put the company squarely ahead of @entity6 which tallied an impressive 74 % favorable rating in their own right			1
at 13 % , @entity6 's negatives were slightly higher than @entity7 's			1
in an analysis of results , pollsters noted that " the time is ripe for this sort of assessment , given these companies ' envied positions in the marketplace			0
" while phones running @entity7 's @entity21 system represent the majority of the world 's smartphones , no single phone has come anywhere near the popularity of @entity6 's @entity52			2
and the @entity53 -- the latest incarnation of which went on sale last month , continues to dominate the tablet computer market			0
both @entity7 and @entity6 fared best with wealthier respondents			2
in fact , in households earning more than $ 100,000 a year , 93 % of respondents expressed a favorable opinion of @entity7 , 91 % of @entity6			1
the results suggest that recent public - relations dings that both companies have taken have n't soured large chunks of their audiences			0

and while @entity6 raked in a record $ 46.3 billion last quarter , some have complained that virtually all of its products are manufactured in @entity82			0
most notably , @entity83 , the manufacturing partner that makes the @entity52 and @entity53 , has been hit with complaints of harsh working conditions			0
in an increasingly tech - centric culture , the poll results suggest consumers may be willing to overlook negative news -- even news that impacts them directly -- if they 're happy with their digital experiences			0
" the services in question , after all , are n't just services ; they are , at this point , everyday and intimate components of people 's lives , " wrote @entity94 of the @entity95			0
" they are , increasingly , implicit			0
" @entity105 , the near ubiquitous social network , did n't fare as well as the top two companies , although with 58 % favorable responses , it still has enough votes to get re-elected			1
