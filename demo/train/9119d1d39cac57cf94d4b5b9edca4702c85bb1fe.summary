@entity0 -- my rosary - packing mom taught me not to say that four - letter word that begins with " h , " not talking about hell but hate			1
but she forbids lying , too , so i am going to be straight -- i hate driving on the @entity7			1
i avoid the 405 like poison oak , or wild - eyed people you randomly meet on story shoots who want you to pitch their product			1
the 405 is a time bandit , a concrete thief that steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic			1
quakes , riots , @entity21 and now this ? l live in the @entity23 , but the 405 is a mandatory evil for times when i must head to @entity26 for @entity1 trips or vacation			1
i tolerate the 405 by blasting the radio or stopping at @entity30 in @entity31 like it 's some oasis			1
the only thing more horrendous than the 405 is the 405 in rush hour			2
the only thing more horrendous than the 405 in rush hour is the 405 in rush hour during an accident			2
the only thing worse than the 405 in rush hour during an accident is to throw in construction			2
' @entity42 ' officially on in @entity0 the 405 defines relationships			2
a budding romance might wilt under pressure of having to drive or cross the 405 for a rendezvous			0
true friends will endure the 405 's whims			1
the 405 tests commitment -- to work , athletic teams and even family			0
my relatives who are clustered up the @entity55 in @entity56 and points beyond fortunately have zero reason to drive the 405 to get to my house , but to them , the 405 is a barrier they still must navigate in @entity60 , like the @entity61 , or the @entity62			0
during " @entity42 " i will test whether it 's faster to fly from @entity64 to @entity65 via @entity66 or just drive it			0
i will win this contest because it takes time to board a plane , and i can mainly avoid the 405			0
i 'll slip around and past it , using the almost as heinous @entity71 and the 710 to get to @entity65			0
the 405 is almost completely out of range as i maneuver far away from its reach , as if i 'm dodging @entity77 archers			0
but for all my abject hate for the 405 , i want this billion - dollar @entity80 lane , improvement and overhaul to work			1
i am rooting for the pain to be eased by new lanes , bridges , on ramps , off ramps interchanges and attitude .			0

@entity1 *senior* producer @entity91 : " i hate " driving the @entity7
the *highway* steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic , he *writes*
for all his hate , he hopes this *weekend* 's *interruption* will lead to less pain on the 405
