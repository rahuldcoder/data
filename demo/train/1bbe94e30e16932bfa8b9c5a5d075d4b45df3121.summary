-- eight and a half years after his third wife was found dead in a bathtub , the murder trial of former @entity3 - area police officer @entity2 is set to begin in earnest with opening statements tuesday			1
the 58 - year - old @entity2 is accused in the 2004 death of his third wife , @entity9 , in a trial that has been postponed for two years			1
he also remains under investigation in the october 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity13			1
a jury of seven men and five women , chosen over two days last week , will weigh @entity2 's fate during a trial in @entity19 , @entity20 , that is expected to last about a month , according to his lawyer @entity21			2
after the jury selection was finished tuesday , @entity24 , @entity20 , state 's attorney @entity22 told reporters , " we 're ready to go ... we 're anxious to get to trial , put the evidence before the jury and arrive at a verdict			0
" @entity21 , meanwhile , said he planned to use his opening statement to " tell the story of @entity2 from beginning to end ... and show the state 's theory is implausible at best			2
" inside @entity2 's tangled love life @entity2 was married to @entity36 in 2001 when he met then 17 - year - old @entity37 ( who later became @entity13 ) , and those two began having an affair			1
@entity36 and @entity2 filed for divorce from each other that october , and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years			2
@entity42 , @entity20 , police records indicate officers were called to @entity36 's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004			2
@entity2 had @entity36 arrested twice for domestic violence , though she was found not guilty in both cases			1
a judge in march 2002 granted @entity36 a protection order from her ex-husband , prohibiting him from being near her , entering her home and taking out their children except for two brief weekly visits			0
( their two sons later spent every other weekend with their father , per the divorce settlement			0
) @entity36 had claimed that , months later , @entity2 held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her inside her home			1
in october 2003 , three months after giving birth to what was @entity2 's fifth child , the then - 19 - year - old @entity37 and 49 - year - old @entity2 married			0
the @entity24 prosecutor alleged that , later that year , @entity2 tried to pay someone $ 25,000 to kill @entity36			1
and her sister @entity71 told @entity72 years later that @entity36 had called her saying she feared " he was going to kill her , and it was going to look like an accident			0
" in session blog : catch up on the @entity2 case in 3 minutes @entity2 picked up his two sons from @entity36 's home on february 27 , 2004 , spending the next two days with them			1
prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on february 29 and killed her ; she was found naked and dead in her dry tub the next day			0
at the time of her death , a court was mulling how their marital assets would be divided and @entity36 was set to receive part of @entity2 's pension and other support			2
police initially treated the scene as an accident , although the @entity92 was later brought in to investigate			0
on march 20 , dr. @entity97 from the @entity24 coroner 's office said in an autopsy report that the cause of @entity36 's death was drowning , her hair was soaked in blood from a cut on her scalp , and she had small bruises on her body			0
a six - person coroner 's jury ruled her death an accident in may 2004 , after an @entity20 state police officer told them investigators had no reason to suspect homicide and that the cut on her head was caused by a fall			1
this trooper had n't gone to the death scene or to the autopsy , nor had he interviewed @entity2			2
@entity36 's family also testified in that coroner 's jury hearing that @entity36 feared her ex-husband , who stood to benefit financially from her death			0
in october 2007 @entity13 contacted a local attorney and told him she wanted to discuss filing for divorce			2
later that month , after divulging her intentions to her husband , she disappeared			0
@entity2 said she abandoned her two children , ages 4 and 2 , and ran off with another man			0
the next month , state police labeled @entity2 a suspect in his fourth wife 's disappearance , though neither he nor anyone else has been charged in that case			1
@entity13 has never been found			2
2009 : @entity2 calls a radio talk show the investigation into @entity13 's disappearance brought renewed interest in @entity36 's death			1
authorities exhumed @entity36 's body , further tests were conducted , and her death was later ruled a " homicide staged to look like an accident			1
" in may 2009 , months after a judge admitted authorities had an " extensive " collection of secretly recorded conversations with @entity2 , @entity2 was indicted and arrested on murder charges in connection with @entity36 's death			1
he was ordered held on $ 20 million bond			1
@entity21 , his lawyer , said then in a written statement that prosecutors would not be able to prove their case because " he did n't do it			0
" " there is no evidence that links @entity2 to the death of @entity9 or anyone else for that matter , " @entity21 said			1
" @entity2 did not harm @entity9 ; he has said so from day 1			1
we 're obviously disappointed a grand jury indicted him			0
but an indictment does not mean guilt			0
" @entity21 told @entity0 he believes the case has always been about circumstantial evidence and that he will bring a pathologist to trial who will say @entity36 died from an accidental drowning			0
" i think the jury 's going to see that , in fact , this always has been an accidental death and still is an accidental death , " @entity21 @entity181 , an attorney for the @entity36 family , said relatives were glad the grand jury felt there was enough evidence to charge @entity2			2
" we 're very happy that the wheels of justice have continued to move , and they are pointing in his direction , " @entity181 told @entity0 affiliate @entity187			0
2010 : @entity195 's letter to the media @entity2 's trial had been set to start in july 2010 , but was delayed			0
this past april , an @entity20 appellate court ruled that prosecutors may use potentially incriminating statements made by @entity36 and @entity2 's still - missing - wife @entity13 against him , a key development in the case			1
the ruling overturned an earlier judge 's decision that forbid prosecutors from using eight statements made by @entity36 before her death and by @entity13 before her disappearance			1
the defense had argued that using the statements would violate @entity2 's right to confront the witnesses against him			0
