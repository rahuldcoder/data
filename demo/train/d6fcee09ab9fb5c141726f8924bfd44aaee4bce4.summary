-- house speaker @entity2 's threatened lawsuit against president @entity3 has elicited scorn from the right and blistering attacks from the left			1
so why is @entity2 pursuing it ? perhaps because he thinks he just might win in the end			2
as political stunts go , @entity2 's is too transparent for my tastes			2
and i say this as a guy who has perpetrated some serious stunt work in my political career			0
@entity2 's not a bad guy			2
one gets the sense he 'd rather be sharing marlboros and merlot with @entity3 than taking him to court			2
but he is a sino : speaker in name only			0
the tea party is driving the @entity26 train these days , which explains the frequent train wrecks			0
so , perhaps to appease the tea party bosses , @entity2 has decided to sue the president			0
highly influential conservative blogger and pundit @entity31 calls the @entity2 lawsuit " taxpayer - funded political theater " and notes that some of @entity2 's complaints about @entity3 are political , not legal or constitutional			1
opinion : @entity2 , do your job instead then there 's the small problem of hypocrisy			1
as the progressive group @entity43 notes in this clever ad , @entity2 has long opposed citizens ' rights to sue corporations over , say , defective products or gender discrimination in the workplace			0
he rails against " frivolous lawsuits " -- until he decides to file one			1
a second way @entity2 is being hypocritical is his support for robust executive authority when @entity56 was exercising it			1
@entity56 issued far more executive orders than @entity3 , going so far as to use his executive authority to authorize waterboarding , which sen. @entity61 flatly describes as torture and a " violation of the @entity64			1
" so , to be clear : @entity56 uses his executive authority more often -- including to turn @entity65 into torturers -- and @entity2 goes along			1
but @entity3 uses his executive authority to give businesses more flexibility in complying with @entity69 or to extend family leave to gay couples , and @entity2 literally wants to make a federal case of it			1
one more sure sign that this is a political puppet show : it is not at all clear which executive actions @entity2 's lawsuit would focus on , because he has not identified them , telling reporters , " when i make that decision , i 'll let you know			2
" @entity2 : why we must now sue the president now , here 's the depressing part : @entity2 's sue first , ask questions later strategy just might work			1
not because the suit has merit but because the @entity91 has several activist @entity26 justices			2
they recently rewrote the @entity94 to declare that corporations have souls and thus have freedom of religion			0
soon , i expect them to grant sainthood to @entity101			0
obviously , i ca n't get into @entity2 's head			1
it is entirely possible that there is no grand strategy here			0
perhaps his lawsuit is just one strand of a handful of spaghetti he 's throwing against the wall just to get through the day and survive the latest tea party onslaught			0
and yet , there is a chance this one strand will stick			0
on the other hand , progressives would do well to assume there is a method to @entity2 's madness			0
the court 's right wing plays a long game			0
perhaps realizing that shifting demographics and a divided @entity26 will make it difficult to put a @entity26 back in the @entity128 , they may seize on @entity2 's lawsuit and use it to further crimp the power of the chief executive			1
unable to marshal the votes to get their legislative agenda through the @entity136 and unable to earn the votes to recapture the @entity128 , it may be that the @entity26 ' strategy for the foreseeable future is to ignore their losses at the ballot box and leave the heavy lifting to the one place where five @entity26 votes can cancel out tens of millions of @entity65 ' votes : the @entity91			1
@entity146 : @entity3 has n't hit rock bottom yet			0

@entity149 : why is @entity2 suing @entity3 in face of criticism ? because he may win
he sees hypocrisy in that @entity2 has criticized frivolous lawsuits , backed @entity56 orders
@entity157 : @entity158 first , ask questions later stunt might find support from @entity91 's right wing
he says if @entity26 ca n't move agenda or *regain* @entity128 , maybe court will do heavy lifting
