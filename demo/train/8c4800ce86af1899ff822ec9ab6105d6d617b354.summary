it calls for reporting on what 's going on , where people are being discriminated against , the violence that is taking place , and it really puts the issue squarely on the @entity1 's agenda going forward			1
" divided opinion continues among some countries about whether the time has come to take up gay rights in the @entity1 forum , @entity21 said , " so this resolution is really significant as far as gaining widespread support for doing just that			1
" the @entity2 lobbied intensively for the resolution , and @entity21 said the @entity50 was pleased to see @entity20 leadership , from @entity9 in particular , as well as strong support from @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1

" @entity21 told @entity0 , " it 's not like discrimination or violence are going to end overnight " because of the @entity1 resolution , " but now ... when there are proposals in parliaments or legislatures around the world to illegalize gay activity or repress people because of their sexual orientation , opponents can point to this and say , ' hey , the @entity1 has spoken out , there is a resolution that rejects this squarely			1
