@entity0 , @entity1 -- " father we ask that you stand with your child @entity5			1
we ask that you strengthen and support her and grant her your grace			0
" it 's the sunday service in @entity0 and the pastor is leading the @entity12 congregation in prayers for @entity14 , the mother of two convicted last month for the crime of apostasy after a court ruled that she abandoned the @entity19 faith			1
it 's crime she strenuously denies , maintaining both that she was raised @entity12 -- in spite of being born to a @entity19 father -- and that she would have been within her rights to leave the faith			1
neither statement has won her clemency under @entity1 's harsh interpretation of islamic law			1
as the pastor finishes his sermon , praying that @entity31 grant her strength , even " as the hangman 's noose swings before her , " he asks that the congregation pray that if she is not granted freedom , the @entity3 will grant her eternal life			0
more than half the pews arranged before him are empty , and members of the choir struggle to fill the hall with their voices			0
as @entity5 's case has dragged on , @entity1 's churches have begun to empty			1
we were asked to conceal the identity of the congregation ; it is clear many @entity52 here are scared			2
and activists tell us it is within good reason			0
after the secession of the majority @entity61 in 2011 , @entity58 president @entity57 announced this new @entity1 would be @entity62 and @entity19 in identity			1
although @entity1 's constitution made provision for both ethnic diversity and religious freedom , shortly after the president 's highly - publicized speech , the then - minister of religious affairs announced that no licenses would be granted to allow for the building of new churches			1
since @entity1 gained independence , problems between @entity0 and the mostly @entity12 regions bordering the new state have intensified			1
the new edicts , many activists told us , felt highly politicized			0
so how deep does the tolerance enshrined in the country 's constitution actually run ? not very , says @entity84 , a prominent @entity58 human rights lawyer , himself a @entity12			1
" if you look at the laws of the country , " he tells us , " the laws favor @entity89			0
" " number one , the crime of apostasy , which is creating a wall around @entity19 that nobody is allowed to leave			2
" and what is worse , he says , is the sense that extremist sentiment toward @entity52 is increasingly tolerated			2
" in the war of propaganda between the two religions , @entity12 will stand no chance			2
all the media is used to promote @entity19 beliefs and to speak about @entity19 as the only religion and to insult other beliefs , especially @entity12 which is normally referred to as being an infidel			1
" last year , @entity84 says he documented around 200 cases of @entity12 foreigners deported for the crime of " evangelizing			1
" " it was almost en masse , " he says			0
" they confiscated bibles and searched @entity12 centers			2
deported them without instigating any legal procedures			0
" @entity2 has placed an interview request with @entity1 's foreign ministry and has been promised that the foreign minister will address the concerns raised			1
in the past , the @entity58 government has pointed to the many churches lining the streets of their capital as evidence of its tolerance			0
many @entity58 we spoke to think the government is obsessed with a belief that -- as one put it -- " christian missionaries ( are ) converting on every street corner			0
" one @entity12 activist , who also declined to be identified , said : " the church is now contaminated with terror			0
you do n't feel safe in prayer			0
" the only hope , she said , was that @entity5 's trial had now brought that terror out into the international spotlight			0
