@entity0 , @entity1 , and a blue brainless blob named @entity13 @entity14 , @entity13 , the blue blob @entity13 and @entity16 dominate " @entity13			1
" and they 're the good guys			0
@entity18 leads the cast of " @entity13 , " providing the voice of @entity21 , who is hit by a glowing meteorite on her wedding day			1
before long she 's grown into the biggest thing around			0
the short - statured @entity26 winner relished the chance to play not only a giant , but also a role model			1
" i was walking with my son and my daughter the other day , and i was like ' who 's your favorite superhero ? ' " @entity18 said			1
" and my son was like ... ' @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , ' and he could name 20 guy superheroes			0
" and so i said to my daughter , ' who 's your favorite superhero ? ' and she goes ' i do n't know , the girl in the back of the @entity44 ? i ca n't remember her name			0
' " so the idea of showcasing a female superhero , @entity18 said , has the actress " really excited			1
" @entity49 , who plays general @entity50 , sees the film as helping kids embrace their diversity			1
" i love the idea that they were gon na make a film that was going to tell young people that it 's all right to be different , " @entity49 said			2
his military veteran character captures @entity21 , renames her " @entity13 , " and locks her up with the other " monsters " he 's collected over half a century			1
" and not only is it all right to be different , that one thing that may make you feel awkward about being different might be your greatest asset			0
" those assets become apparent when an alien invader ( voiced by @entity70 of " @entity71 " ) decides he wants @entity72 , and the monsters -- @entity13 , dr. @entity73 ( " @entity75 " star @entity74 ) , @entity14 ( @entity76 ) , and the gelatinous @entity13 ( @entity77 ) -- are called upon to save the planet			1
the film , which also features the voices of @entity81 and @entity82 , opens friday			0
most of the cast had previous experience in animation voiceover -- last year , @entity77 was featured in " @entity87 , " and he and @entity76 were heard in " @entity88 " -- but it was the first time for @entity70			1
" they called me and they said ' they 're interested in you for this , playing an evil alien warlord , ' and i was like ' where do i sign ? ' " he said with a chuckle			2
it was a welcome change of pace for @entity49 , who recorded his voice tracks for " monsters " while he was filming the uber - intense " 24			1
" " so , for five days a week i 'm very serious in the ' 24 ' world , and then for five hours on the weekend i got to be 5 years old and just play a cartoon character " -- a character he says he saw as a combination of @entity109 's intense gunnery sergeant in " @entity110 " and that ' toon terror , @entity112			0
" we combined these voices and the producers laughed , which is generally a pretty good sign , " @entity49 said			2
@entity49 may have been inspired by the classics , but the @entity4 aspect of " monsters " is as modern as movie technology gets			1
under the command of @entity124 chief @entity123 ( whom @entity18 and @entity49 respectfully called " mr. @entity125 " ) , the film was conceived from the beginning as a @entity4 project			1
one early scene uses the process to bounce a paddleball out at the audience , but for the most part , the effect is used immersively , to bring viewers into the " monsters " world			0
" you really feel like you 're there , like you 're a part of this thing , " said @entity76 , " not in a way that 's gratuitous and to just sort of show off , but really so that the viewer can be an active participant in the movie			2
" while film technology continues to advance , some things never change			0
as @entity21 is still trying to get used to her new size and powers , she finds herself simultaneously battling an alien robot and trying to save dozens of people trapped in their cars on the @entity151 while her male cohorts mostly just stand around			0
one tries to encourage her by calling " you 're doing it ! " to which @entity21 snaps back , " i 'm doing everything ! " " the quintessential cry ! " @entity18 said			2
" the female war cry ! that 's one of my favorite lines			0
" ireport.com : does 3 - d make you more likely to see a movie ? of course , it 's hardly a spoiler to reveal that -- eventually -- @entity21 not only bonds with the rest of her motley crew , but also gains the self - confidence to see the positives in her accidental enormousness			2
as @entity70 , the film 's villain , noted , " it 's a coming - of - age tale -- for the monster inside of each one of us			0
" and , perhaps , it will give some little girls a superhero to look up to .			0

" @entity13 " is about motley group of *misfits* who team up to *defeat* alien
monsters are led by almost 50 - foot woman , voiced by @entity18
@entity18 says she hopes character can be role model for girls
