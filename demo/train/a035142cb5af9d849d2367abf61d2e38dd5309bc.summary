it 's been a long old road to recovery for @entity4 skiing star @entity3			1
the olympic gold medal winner and four time overall @entity7 champion has been sidelined for much of the last two years after undergoing separate bouts of surgery on a recurring knee injury			1
a promising returning to action in late 2013 was cut short by a fall in training which meant she missed out on defending her downhill crown at the @entity16 in @entity17			1
now , after knuckling down in the gym and overcoming that bitter disappointment , the 30 - year - old @entity3 is finally set to return to competitive action			1
and opening up to @entity22 , she revealed her secret weapon as she fought to get back to the top of the slopes -- her boyfriend and golf star , @entity28			1
" @entity28 and i both went through rehab with our injuries at a similar time , so we were both in the gym together and pushing each other and motivating each other , both frustrated , " @entity3 said			1
" i think we both helped each other a lot through that time , and i drew a lot of inspiration from him and i think he does the same with me			2
" we continue to push each other and it 's a really positive relationship in that way			0
" @entity28 ' own injury problems began after a promising start to 2014			1
the 14 - time major champion regained the @entity46 1			1
spot in march but was unable to recapture the form that took him there after undergoing back surgery shortly afterwards			0
a poor summer meant @entity28 dropped out of contention for a place in the @entity4 's ill - fated @entity55 team			1
given his high profile and status within the golfing community , much of the media attention in the run up to the @entity55 focused on @entity28 ' absence			2
being a star that transcends her own sport in a similar manner , @entity3 can empathize as to the added pressure that the unflinching glare of the spotlight can bring			2
" for us , we 're just two athletes trying to do the best we can in our sports , " she said			0
" there 's other stuff that goes along with it for both of us , there 's media and stuff like that			0
" @entity3 recently criticized a satirical article published in the @entity81 that poked fun at @entity28			1
she said she was proud of her boyfriend for taking a stand in criticizing the piece and described much of the reaction surrounding his response as " completely ridiculous " in quotes carried by @entity90			2
@entity3 is more laid back discussing media relations today			2
although not directly referring to that incident in particular , she said the attention is " all part of sports and part of being a successful athlete			0
we both understand that and take it in our stride			0
" a chipper @entity3 even revealed the celebrity pair are intensively competitive with one another			1
responding to a question on whether her golf is better than @entity28 's skiing , @entity3 said that was perhaps too difficult to say			1
" it 's tricky -- i have a hole in one			0
but he 's a pretty good skier			0
" " we 're highly competitive			2
we 're competing at every single thing that we can			0
and unfortunately he holds the record in ping - pong			0
" i have only one victory to i do n't know how many hundreds he has			0
" " he 's pretty much better than me at everything , except skiing , so unfortunately he 's the winner of the two of us			0
