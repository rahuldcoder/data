-- the @entity1 has just done a huge favor to those elements in the @entity5 world that thrive on anti-westernism			2
by voting to ban the veil in public places -- a move that brings a draft bill closer to becoming law -- it has transformed a minor social irritant for a section of the @entity16 public into a major political issue			2
in doing so , it is feeding worldwide @entity5 resentment against the @entity20 almost on par with the occupation of the @entity24 territories and the invasion of @entity26			0
this act is seen throughout the @entity5 world as a deliberate provocation and may bring about equally provocative responses			0
it is also seen as a clear signal that most @entity16 and indeed most @entity32 believe that some @entity34 social mores , even if practiced only by a very small fringe element of @entity5 women , as in this case , are incompatible with @entity32 " values			1
" it also makes @entity32 advocacy of human rights , especially women 's rights , ring hollow by making it clear that in this instance it is used in the service of racism			1
in short , it bears out the " clash of civilizations " thesis propagated by the likes of @entity34 scholar @entity53 and political scientist @entity54 on the one hand and @entity56 and @entity57 on the other			0
the symbolic value of the banning of the veil in @entity16 and related attempts to do so in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and elsewhere in @entity32 goes far beyond the immediate impact of such legislation on the lives of a very tiny minority of @entity5 women in @entity32 who choose to cover their faces in public			1
it comes at a time of increased @entity32 antagonism toward @entity5 immigrants in their midst , as demonstrated by the increase in popularity of right wing anti-immigrant parties in countries such as the @entity83 and @entity84			2
it also comes in the context of increasing resistance , especially by @entity88 and @entity16 , to @entity90 's membership in the @entity91			0
before the @entity16 ban proposal , nothing signified @entity32 's fear of " @entity34 contamination " more than the obstacles put in the way of @entity90 's progress to @entity91 membership , especially when contrasted with the incorporation into the @entity91 of former @entity102 satellites with questionable democratic traditions and fragile economies			1
for most politically conscious @entity5 , the ban on the veil and the snail 's pace on @entity90 's bid for @entity91 membership , have merged into one mammoth display of @entity32 bigotry			1
it is now clear that many , if not most , @entity32 elites , especially the leadership in @entity16 and @entity88 , are engaged -- despite their secular protestations -- in protecting " @entity119 " from both the enemy without ( @entity90 ) and the enemy within ( the @entity5 immigrants )			1
everything else , including talk about the rights of @entity5 women , is just rhetoric that nobody in the @entity5 world takes seriously			2
i would like to add to this discussion a post-script in the words of the well - known legal philosopher @entity131			0
according to @entity131 , a prominent argument in favor of banning the veil or the burqa is that it " symbolizes the objectification of women ( that they are being seen as mere objects )			2
" the " glaring flaw in the argument is that society is suffused with symbols of male supremacy that treat women as objects			0
sex magazines , nude photos , tight jeans -- all these products , arguably , treat women as objects , as do so many aspects of our media culture			0
and what about the ' degrading prison ' of plastic surgery ? ... is n't much of this done in order to conform to a male norm of female beauty that casts women as sex objects ? proponents of the burqa - ban do not propose to ban all these objectifying practices			1
" the obvious answer to @entity131 's rhetorical question is that none of these latter practices that she lists are remotely connected with @entity34			0
the target of the veil ban is not female objectification and male domination ; it is a product of an irrational but visceral fear of @entity34 and @entity5 in @entity32 : the @entity5 are coming , therefore ban the veil and prevent @entity90 from entering the @entity91			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

@entity178 says @entity16 plan to ban veils is gift to those that push anti-westernism
it makes @entity32 human rights advocacy hollow by using it in this case for racism , he says
@entity194 is sign that @entity32 trying to protect " @entity119 " from @entity5
@entity178 : veil - ban is not about women as objects , but about irrational fear of @entity34 in @entity32
