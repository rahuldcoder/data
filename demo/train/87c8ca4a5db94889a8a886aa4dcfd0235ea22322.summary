at the former headquarters of the @entity5 secret police , cheerful @entity1 and @entity2 tourists scan maps and chatter as they file into the blocky concrete building once known as " the @entity9			0
" in its heyday , the @entity10 , or @entity11 , was the all - powerful shadow government of the communist @entity5 ( @entity5 )			2
behind a grim concrete screen molded into eye - shaped portholes , true believer @entity13 created the world 's first surveillance state -- operating a network of agents and informers so vast it encompassed every school , factory , apartment block and bar in the country , according to @entity29 , the author of " @entity30 : stories from behind the @entity32			1
" @entity13 's grim bureaucracy was n't the only game in town , i discovered on a do - it - yourself tour of " the spy 's @entity32			1
" before the @entity32 came down in 1989 , the unique position of @entity32 -- a walled outpost of freedom behind the @entity42 -- made the divided city the focus of @entity46 and @entity47 " tradecraft " for nearly 50 years , says @entity48 , author of " @entity32 : capital of @entity50			1
" " only here in @entity32 were the main protagonists of the @entity53 living door to door , " @entity48 says			1
along with the @entity9 , now home to the @entity58 ( @entity59 103 , @entity60 1 , @entity32 ; +49 30 553 68 54 ) , various sites around the city commemorate the capital 's clandestine history -- even as revelations that the @entity64 was until recently tapping chancellor @entity66 's mobile phone prove that the tradition lives on			1
@entity68 : tell us your favorite thing about @entity32 noir intrigue there 's a wealth of experiences here for the espionage buff			1
on a rainy night at @entity78 ( @entity79 43 - 45 , @entity80 , @entity32 ) , the most famous crossing point between @entity5 and @entity32 , it 's just possible to imagine the noir intrigue of @entity84 's " @entity83 " -- however much a tourist destination it becomes on a sunny afternoon			1
watching the incomparable movie version starring @entity87 helps			0
featured in that masterpiece as well as countless other films , the crossing 's main historical importance stems from the infamous " @entity78 standoff , " when a 1961 confrontation between @entity47 and @entity1 tanks nearly sparked @entity95 outside the @entity96 ( @entity97 17 , @entity98 ; +49 30 46777790 ) -- another @entity84 locale -- the @entity100 , or @entity100 , captures the atmosphere of paranoia more vividly			2
named for the tearful goodbyes of separated families , this station was once the official crossing point for @entity32 @entity107 visiting relatives in the @entity5			1
( @entity84 's " @entity114 " recounts the story of a surrender to border guards here in " @entity113			2
" ) along with smuggled contraband and artifacts from " behind the @entity118 , " the museum showcases an incredible exhibition of video interviews and documentary footage -- as well as the original signs and apparatus for the checkpoint searches and interviews			0
on the outskirts of town , the @entity1 side of the spy story is on display at the @entity131 ( @entity132 135 , @entity32 ; +49 30 8181990 ) in @entity133 -- which houses seven meters of a 420 - meter - long allied forces spy tunnel dug under the @entity118 to tap @entity5 telephone lines in 1953			1
( a story fictionalized in @entity139 's " @entity138 " and the later movie starring @entity141			2
) one of the most celebrated missions of the early @entity53 , the tunnel was the largest and most expensive intelligence operation in @entity145 in the 1950s			2
but it 's hard to say who benefited from it most , says " @entity150 " author @entity48			0
though the tunnel allowed the @entity152 to intercept some 400,000 @entity47 army telephone calls and countless telegraph messages before it was discovered in 1956 , the @entity151 knew about it from the beginning , @entity48 explains			0
they kept that knowledge hidden from @entity32 to protect their own man in the @entity2 government , @entity163 case officer and double agent @entity162			2
the eastern portion of the tunnel , long thought to be lost , was discovered by a man chopping wood in 2012			0
' @entity168 ' near the tunnel 's original location , the @entity169 , or @entity170 , ( @entity171 1 , @entity32 ) between @entity172 in the @entity32 and @entity173 in the @entity5 , is perhaps the most famous espionage landmark in the city			1
the border crossing designated for the exchange of captured spies , it was here that a @entity184 agent caught spying for the @entity151 in @entity186 was traded for downed u- 2 spy plane pilot @entity187			0
it 's an attractive spot on the @entity189 , but there 's little more than a plaque to mark its significance , so it 's best viewed today as a quick stop on a larger tour of @entity173 or other nearby sites			0
at the @entity196 , or @entity198 's @entity197 , a similar listening post -- this one an abandoned @entity1 radar station and observation tower -- has been taken over by @entity32 's ubiquitous graffiti artists			1
a silent tour around the strange , white radomes -- weatherproof microwave antennae cases reminiscent of @entity207 's @entity206 -- gives an eerie feeling in the age of the recent @entity64 disclosures from @entity211			0
once a secretive military enclave , the full history of the complex wo n't be revealed until documents are declassified in 2022 , but it 's estimated more than 1,000 spies worked here throughout the @entity53 , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year , as part of a surveillance network known as @entity220			0
for me , though , nothing captures the @entity53 spy 's world better than the hot and stuffy @entity58 , where the @entity5 spymaster 's suite of offices and conference rooms have been preserved unchanged			1
in these spartan chambers , banks of @entity231 telephones , steel desks and chunky typewriters evoke what renowned @entity237 trial chronicler @entity236 might have called " the bureaucracy of evil , " had she written about @entity5 rather than the @entity237			0
as the milky light reflects off the wood paneling , a shudder runs down my spine .			0

@entity32 's past as an espionage *hotspot* has left the city with *numerous* spying - linked attractions
the @entity58 features relics of @entity252 's *obsession* with *monitoring* its own *people*
other destinations *include* a tunnel dug to tap into communication lines , and an antenna tower
