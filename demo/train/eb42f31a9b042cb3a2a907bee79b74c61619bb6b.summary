-- having terrorized @entity4 defenses all season , @entity2 's @entity1 turned his considerable striking talents to putting the frighteners on the @entity9 national team			1
and then some -- @entity9 were left reeling as the @entity12 forward 's two goals earned @entity2 a vital 2 - 1 win in their @entity15 match in @entity16 thursday this barely four weeks are undergoing knee surgery to all but end @entity9 's interest in the @entity19 and keep alive @entity2 's hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages			1
it was a performance that @entity24 's team were all too familiar with -- the @entity25 scored 31 goals for @entity12 in the league last season -- but could do nothing about			0
equally it was a performance that must have been particularly tough on the five @entity12 players that started for @entity9 and especially for @entity32 , who played an unfortunate part in @entity1 's winning goal			1
@entity1 had watched from the bench as @entity2 stumbled to defeat in their opening match against @entity37 but he did n't take long to make an impact against @entity9			1
plenty of questions had been asked if @entity1 could be 100 % fit after missing a month 's football , but if anything he appeared refreshed by his layoff			2
a busy first half was capped with a goal six minutes before the break when @entity1 headed past goalkeeper @entity47 after @entity49 's diagonal chip had split @entity9 's defense			1
@entity1 almost beat the @entity52 keeper again four minutes into the second half with a low inswinging corner			1
@entity47 managed to bat the ball away off the line this time but should have been picking the ball out of the net three minutes later when @entity49 was played through			0
a goal seemed certain but the @entity60 striker conspired to squirt his shot wide			0
the miss seemed to rejuvenate @entity9 who began to play their way back into the game			0
having headed against the bar in the opening half , @entity68 , restored to his more favored central attacking role , forced a fine smothering save from @entity71 in the 53rd minute and @entity72 also went close shortly after			2
@entity68 's first goal in three @entity19 finals put @entity9 back on level terms in the 75th minute			1
when the @entity78 striker side - footed home from @entity80 's cross @entity9 looked to have seized the initiative at a crucial time			1
but it did n't last long as @entity1 pounced on an error by his @entity12 teammate @entity32 in the 84th minute			0
a speculative punt up field glanced off the head of the @entity9 captain and into the path of @entity1 who steadied himself before lashing in his 41st international goal			1
it was a goal that typified @entity1 's predatory instincts , both in the finish but also the way he had almost expected that the ball would fall into his path			2
defeat leaves @entity9 pointless from their two opening matches			0
at the very least they will need to beat @entity37 in their final match and hope other results go their way			0
" we 're devastated , " @entity9 manager @entity24 told @entity105 after the match			2
" i thought we had done enough to get a draw			0
@entity1 's first goal was exceptional			2
the second he was bit fortunate to get himself free			0
we know what he can do			0
" lucky or not , @entity1 's winner puts @entity2 level on three points with @entity37 and @entity114 who play in @entity116 on friday			1
