-- a cousin of @entity2 , who was shot dead by @entity4 athlete @entity3 , said thursday that he should " pay for what he has done " with a prison sentence , as she testified at his sentencing hearing			1
@entity9 , the first witness called by state prosecutor @entity10 , also dismissed suggestions that the double amputee should serve a sentence of house arrest or community service , saying that would not " fit the crime			1
" " this is not easy for me			0
i really believe the accused , mr. @entity3 , needs to pay for what he has done , " she said , sounding choked with emotion			1
" my family are not people who are seeking revenge			1
we just feel that to take someone 's life , to shoot somebody behind a door that is unarmed , that is harmless , needs sufficient punishment			2
" @entity9 , testifying for a second day , told the court that initially , she was worried about prison conditions for @entity3 , but when she realized that he 'd be treated humanely , she felt he should receive jail time			1
" everybody has suffered here , and i think we need to give a message to society that you can not do this and get away with it , " she said			0
@entity3 ' sentence -- custodial or not -- will be decided by judge @entity45 , who also presided over his trial			1
the olympian was cleared of murder last month but found guilty of culpable homicide , or negligently killing @entity2 , when he fired four shots through a toilet door in his home			2
he said he believed there was an intruder behind the door			0
' it 's ruined our whole family ' @entity9 said she was " very fearful of the accused " and had tried to put him out of her mind			2
" we even made a point of not mentioning his name in our house because i did n't want to spend any energy thinking about him , " she said			0
defense attorney @entity67 asked thursday if @entity9 was aware that @entity3 had written letters to @entity2 's family but under advice from his lawyers had n't given them to the family			1
he said that @entity3 wants privately to apologize to the family			2
@entity9 is the only member of @entity2 's family to have testified before the court , though the model 's parents , @entity79 and @entity80 , have been present for proceedings			1
on wednesday , @entity9 said that the health of @entity2 's father , @entity83 , has suffered as a result of his daughter 's death and that he had a couple of strokes			1
" it 's ruined our whole family			0
it 's ruined @entity79 and june			0
@entity2 was everything to them , " she said			0
prisons chief : we can accommodate @entity3 acting national commissioner of correctional services @entity97 told the court thursday that the system would be able to meet @entity3 ' needs as a disabled prisoner			1
@entity97 said that @entity4 's prisons are used to taking in all kinds of prisoners , including juveniles and the elderly , and that there are facilities to deal with every kind of inmate			0
the prison system deals with 128 disabled inmates on a daily basis , he said when an inmate enters the system , a health assessment is swiftly done to determine whether a prisoner needs a single cell , he said			1
he insisted that if @entity3 were given a prison term , the hospital section of @entity122 prison in @entity123 had the facilities to accommodate his needs			2
" there should be no doubt in the minds of @entity4 that mr. @entity3 and any other inmate with disabilities will be accommodated properly , " he said			0
overcrowding is an issue across the prison system , he acknowledged , but has been reduced from a rate of 63 % in 2005 to 31 % today			1
asked about the problems of gangs and violence in prisons , @entity97 said that more needs to be done to eradicate gangs outside the prison system and that within the system , authorities are dealing with the issue			1
@entity67 , in questioning @entity97 , made the point that whether @entity3 was given a single cell in the hospital section of @entity147 would depend on those evaluating his case when he entered prison			2
however , @entity97 's testimony indicates that he does not think @entity3 should be held in the general section of the prison , @entity67 said			1
he also raised concerns about what illnesses @entity3 could be exposed to in the hospital section -- tuberculosis is a problem in @entity4 prisons -- and the levels of medical staffing			0
probation officer @entity161 , who testified earlier in the week , said she did not think that @entity4 's prison system could cater adequately to a vulnerable prisoner like @entity3			1
no minimum sentence there is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in @entity4 law , so it will be up to the judge to decide			0
a typical sentence is five to eight years			0
but it is a principle of @entity4 law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person , as opposed to the crime			0
that makes predicting a sentence difficult , said @entity179 , a @entity0 legal analyst			0
the judge also found @entity3 guilty of one weapons - related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant			2
the maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars			0
but he could get a lesser sentence , such as a fine or the loss of his gun license .			0

@entity3 should " pay for what he has done , " says @entity2 's cousin
@entity2 family is not seeking revenge , she says , but believes punishment should fit the crime

@entity3 ' sentence will be decided by judge @entity45 at the end of the hearing
