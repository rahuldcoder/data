@entity0 , @entity1 -- even though a @entity1 judge postponed a preliminary hearing for @entity6 wednesday , it still was a dramatic day in court for the father of the young woman van der @entity6 is accused of killing			1
@entity10 said wednesday was the first time he saw the alleged killer of his daughter face to face			1
" it was a very tough moment , " he told @entity2 shortly after leaving a courtroom inside @entity0 's @entity16 prison , noting that it seemed van der @entity6 was enjoying many privileges			2
" i thought i 'd see someone skinny ... but no , he was fatter than when he first went to prison			0
" the judge rescheduled the closed - door hearing -- which involves some evidence in the case -- for next tuesday , because van der @entity26 did not have legal representation in the courtroom wednesday , @entity10 said			1
his daughter , @entity29 , was found dead in a @entity0 hotel room registered to @entity6 in may 2010			1
police say @entity6 took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to @entity35 , where he was arrested a few days later			2
earlier this month , @entity6 's defense attorney , @entity36 , resigned , citing unspecified differences in strategy			2
if van der @entity6 does not have an attorney next week , the judge said he would appoint one , @entity10 said			1
the 23 - year - old van der @entity6 was once the prime suspect in the disappearance in @entity44 of @entity46 @entity45 , who vanished at age 18 while on a graduation trip			1
he was arrested twice but never charged in connection with her disappearance			0
shortly after his 2010 arrest , a federal grand jury in @entity54 indicted him on charges that he tried to extort $ 250,000 from the @entity58 family			0
@entity6 offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of @entity45 's remains in exchange for the money , according to the indictment			2
@entity1 authorities have yet to file formal charges against @entity6			1
once the discovery phase of the case ends , prosecutors will file charges and a trial date will be set			0
it could be weeks before the @entity1 trial begins			1
@entity10 said the family hoped @entity6 would be charged with robbery and homicide , which would carry a maximum sentence of life in prison			1
before his resignation from the case , @entity36 told in session his client attacked @entity83 after she found something on his computer that tied him to @entity58			0
he gave in session a copy of a motion he filed asking that van der @entity26 face a lesser charge for a crime of passion			0
" my client ... admits having murdered the victim , but not with ferocity , for profit or pleasure , nor any of the other element ( s ) that make up this murder , but only by violent emotion that overtook him at the time he was attacked by the victim , " the motion read			0
however , @entity10 and @entity102 , an attorney representing the @entity10 family , argued that a police investigation indicated the last time anyone had searched for information about @entity58 on van der @entity6 's computer was the day before @entity10 ' death -- suggesting the attorney 's explanation that van der @entity6 attacked @entity10 after she read an e-mail on his computer was a lie			1
" that hypothesis has already been defeated , " @entity10 said wednesday			2
despite the latest delay in the case , he said he was confident that justice would prevail , and that he would be able to face van der @entity26 in court again			0
" i am confident that @entity119 will give me the strength , " he said			0
in @entity122 's @entity121 contributed to this report .			0
