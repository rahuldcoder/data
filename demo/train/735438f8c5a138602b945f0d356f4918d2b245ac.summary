-- a @entity5 , @entity4 , couple , their real estate agent and a real estate broker face charges of violating the federal @entity8 for refusing to sell a $ 1.8 million home to black radio personality and comedian @entity11 , the @entity2 @entity1 said			1
the five - bedroom , 8,000 - square - foot home was listed for $ 1.799 million by owners @entity15 and @entity16 and their real estate agent , @entity18 , the housing agency said in a statement tuesday			1
the charge alleges the @entity21 and @entity18 stalled negotiations and took the property off the market after receiving a $ 1.7 million offer from @entity11 and his wife , @entity26 -- the highest offer the @entity21 had received in the two years the property was listed , according to @entity1			1
the @entity21 accepted the offer , but refused to sign the sales contract , according to the @entity1 complaint			1
six days after the offer was accepted , the @entity32 ' agent asked about the issue , and @entity18 told her that the " ' reality " of selling the house was ' just hitting ' " @entity16 , the complaint said			1
the woman said she did n't believe that , since the house had been listed for two years , according to the complaint			2
@entity18 sent the agent a text message the following day saying he did not believe it was about race , and believed it to be a " seller vs. seller issue not a seller vs. buyer issue			1
" but the next day , @entity18 told the @entity32 ' agent that the @entity21 were not signing the sales contract and taking the home off the market			1
" @entity58 gave complainants various reasons for why the @entity21 had decided not to sell , " the complaint said , including that @entity16 had changed her mind , that the @entity54 could not find another home , and they wanted to keep their children in their current schools			2
the @entity61 told @entity1 investigators they refused to sign the sales contract because @entity16 wanted the full asking price for the home			1
@entity66 , named as the @entity54 ' attorney by the @entity68 , did not return a call from @entity0 seeking comment wednesday			2
the @entity32 filed an initial @entity1 complaint in january , amending it in march and july			2
the couple learned that the @entity32 had filed a @entity1 complaint on january 29 , the complaint said , and a few days later told @entity18 to offer the @entity32 the opportunity to buy the home with all its furnishings for $ 1.799 million			1
" when the @entity32 learned that the @entity21 only offered to sell the subject property to them after receipt of the @entity1 complaint , they canceled a scheduled showing and declined the offer , " according to the complaint			1
@entity18 told investigators that while he was representing the @entity54 , @entity86 told him he would prefer not to sell the home to an @entity88 , but added " if it was for the right price he did not care who bought the house , " the complaint said			1
however , the agency " has determined that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred in this case based on race and has authorized and directed the issuance of this charge of discrimination , " according to the complaint			0
the charge will be heard by an administrative law judge unless a party elects to have it heard in federal district court , @entity1 said			0
if the judge finds discrimination occurred , damages may be awarded and fines may be levied			0
punitive damages can also be awarded if the case is heard in district court			0
besides the @entity21 , the @entity114 and real estate broker @entity115 are also named in the complaint			0
" racial fairness is important at all income levels			0
civil rights enforcement must be the effective shield against housing discrimination that in this case wealth was not , " stated @entity123 , @entity1 assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity			0
@entity11 is a radio personality who co-hosts the syndicated " @entity126			1
" he also has appeared as a comedian on television and in films , the complaint said			0
@entity0 's attempts to reach @entity11 were unsuccessful			2
" i think it 's unfortunate , sad and disgusting , " @entity11 told the @entity68			1
" it jolts you to your core beliefs			0
. no one has the right to dictate the @entity2 dream			0
" " @entity140 and @entity141 have suffered emotional distress due to respondents ' discriminatory acts , " the complaint says			0
@entity11 has indicated he is less trusting of people and their actions , and " he feels respondents have denied him the @entity2 dream he worked so hard to attain			2
they are surprised that something like this could happen in the year 2010			0
" the @entity32 ' children " were disappointed at the loss of certain features of the house , and ... felt fear because of how they might be treated because of race , " the complaint said			0
" the @entity162 ' daughter felt hurt and angry and now worries that if this happened to her parents that it may happen to her one day in her own search for housing as an adult			0
