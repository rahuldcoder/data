-- there is something deeply troubling about president @entity4 's decision to grant legal safe haven to unauthorized immigrants by executive order			1
it is n't the underlying policy that is troubling			2
we have known for years that we would never deport some 11 million people from our midst			0
many have become hard - working , productive members of our society , and @entity17 , working with the @entity14 , should long ago have provided them a safe pathway out of the shadows			1
in that sense , this policy is good			0
one wonders indeed why the president , having decided to take the plunge , did n't go further and build a pathway to fuller benefits such as health care for those who establish a solid record of work and good behavior			2
nor is it even the questionable legality that disturbs			1
on many occasions during our history , presidents have tested the boundaries of their constitutional power through executive orders : @entity43 's suspension of habeas corpus , his @entity45 , @entity47 's creation of the @entity48 , @entity47 's awful internment of @entity50 , and @entity52 's integration of the armed forces were all accomplished through controversial executive orders			2
during the 19th century , conventional wisdom held that presidents had only as much authority as the constitution explicitly granted ; @entity58 famously flipped that proposition on its head -- unless the @entity62 explicitly forbids , he argued , the president has implied authority to act , especially as commander - in - chief			2
many of his successors have agreed and usually the courts have gone along with them			0
even so , president @entity4 's executive order on immigration seems to move us into uncharted , dangerous waters			1
it is one thing for a president like @entity43 or @entity47 to act unilaterally in national emergencies			0
in nearly all the big examples of the past -- like the @entity45 -- they were also acting as commander - in - chief			0
as the one foremost responsible for protecting the nation 's existence , a president as commander - in - chief has long been recognized as having inherent powers that stretch well beyond those of normal governance			2
not an emergency but the challenges of immigration policy do not represent a national emergency , nor do they touch upon the military authorities of a president			2
rather , they represent the chronic , abysmal failures of politicians in @entity96 to govern well from both ends of @entity98			0
they helped create this immigration mess over a long number of years and working together , they have a public duty to solve it			0
the @entity14 has repeatedly pointed to immigration - related executive orders issued by past presidents , notably @entity106 and @entity107 , to support the legality of president @entity4 's order and to palliate its partisan sting			1
both the executive orders cited , however , can be distinguished from the case at hand			0
@entity106 granted amnesty to 100,000 undocumented immigrants to close a loophole in the comprehensive immigration reform bill passed in 1986			0
@entity107 's order , which granted amnesty to at most 1.5 million people ( although the actual number who benefited is likely much smaller ) , also attempted to clean up a piece of legislation			0
as @entity126 writes in @entity127 , the @entity106 and @entity107 examples were presidents trying to implement congressional directives , as is constitutionally permissible , whereas the current action is the president telling @entity17 " i 'm going to implement my own directives			1
" while the president 's impatience is understandable and his anger at @entity138 intransigence is well placed , that does not justify an abandonment of traditional ways of addressing hard public problems			2
against the spirit of the @entity62 one can argue whether this executive order is legal , but it certainly violates the spirit of the founders			0
they intentionally focused @entity148 of the @entity62 on the @entity17 and @entity149 on the president			1
that is because the @entity17 is the body charged with passing laws and the president is the person charged with faithfully carrying them out			1
in effect , the @entity17 was originally seen as the pre-eminent branch and the president more of a clerk			1
the president 's power grew enormously in the 20th century but even so , the @entity62 still envisions @entity17 and the president as co-equal branches of government -- or as the scholar @entity167 observed , co-equal branches sharing power			1
for better or worse , @entity168 have always expected that in addressing big , tough domestic issues , @entity17 and the president had to work together to find resolution			1
for a president to toss aside such deep traditions of governance is a radical , imprudent step			0
when a president in day - to - day operations can decide which laws to enforce and which to ignore , where are the limits on his power ? where are the checks and balances so carefully constructed in the @entity62 ? if a @entity188 president can cancel existing laws on immigration , what is to prevent the next @entity138 from unilaterally canceling laws on health care ? a bad way to start with new @entity17 coming on the heels of midterm elections that were a clear call for a change of course in @entity96 , starting in the @entity14 , this is also a discouraging way to open the final years of this presidency			1
a new @entity203 / @entity202 poll finds that by 53 - 40 % , @entity168 feel positive about the election results ; by 56 - 33 % , they want @entity17 to set policy for the country , not the president ; by 57 - 40 % they favor a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants but by 42 - 32 % , they disapprove of @entity4 overhauling immigration through executive order			1
why is n't the @entity14 listening to the public ? in retrospect , it would have been far better if coming out of the elections , the president had said he had promised he would act through executive order before the end of the year , but in light of the election results , he would work with the new @entity17 for six months			1
if there were no legislation , he would act on his own			0
that would have been a much fairer proposition , would have started out with republicans on better footing , and would have rallied the public behind him if the @entity138 refused to cooperate			0
sadly , we instead have an action from the @entity14 that will cast a dark shadow over prospects for legislative cooperation , falls short of what the immigrant population had hoped and steers us into deep , unknown waters in our governance .			0
