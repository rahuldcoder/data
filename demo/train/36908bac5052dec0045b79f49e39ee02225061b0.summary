-- @entity2 's grip on the world number one spot in golf loosened friday after a disastrous seven - over - par 79 at the @entity6 's @entity5 at @entity7 saw the @entity8 miss the cut			1
@entity2 had cut a frustrated and angry figure during an opening 74 , but after a solid start to his second round he dropped a string of shots on the back nine			1
it opens the door for @entity19 's @entity18 , who needs to finish in the top - eight in the @entity6 's flagship event to reclaim top spot			1
@entity18 , who is the defending champion , carded a second straight 68 to share second place on eight - under - par with scot @entity23			1
they both trail runaway leader @entity25 who carded a superb eight - under 64 in calmer morning conditions to lead at halfway on 12 - under 132			1
@entity2 faced an uphill battle to make the cut , but had recovered to stand one - under for the day through the seventh			1
but a double bogey on the eighth started the rot and he proceeded to card five straight bogeys and another double bogey on the 15th			0
for the 23 - year - old , who also missed the cut at the @entity39 on the @entity40 , it is hardly ideal preparation for his defense of the @entity44 title next month			2
" it 's been a week i 'd like to forget			0
it 's not nice to play like this and not nice two weeks in a row			0
maybe it 's a good thing i have two days off to practice and i 'm looking to getting back to the @entity54 next week , " he told gathered reporters			0
@entity18 , who can benefit the most from @entity2 's implosion , insisted that repeating his 2011 success on the @entity58 course was his first priority			1
" to be honest , the focus is always to try and win the tournament , " he told the official @entity6 website			2
@entity25 , who lives nearby , is looking to add to his 2010 @entity64 success and finished in fine style with an eagle			2
a fine all - round sportsman , he played in the @entity19 under - 17 cricket team with current test players @entity70 and @entity71 , but has never regretted turning to golf full time			0
" playing golf is better than standing in the field all day , " he jokingly told reporters			0
@entity76 of @entity77 and @entity79 's @entity78 shared fourth spot on seven - under			0
@entity81 was among a number of star players to struggle in blustery afternoon conditions and was right on the cut line at one - over 145 .			0
