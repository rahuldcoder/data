-- @entity2 's authoritarian president @entity1 is a villain out of a @entity4 movie : buffoonish and sinister in equal measure			1
sunday 's vote result powerfully exposes both sides of his clown - prince system of rule			1
read more : survivor and @entity2 's long - serving president for weeks before the vote , @entity1 signaled a willingness to surrender power , should the result go against him			1
on @entity16 itself , he gave the @entity2 newspaper @entity18 a quote indicating he foresaw the possibility of defeat			2
" let 's get ready to recognize the results , whatever they are , " he said			0
. and yet just a few hours later , @entity2 's @entity25 showed @entity1 winning massively , by nearly 10 percentage points			1
is the result legitimate ? that 's hard to say			2
@entity2 has not invited any international election observers since 2006 and anomalies have been observed in past votes , especially the 2004 referendum to recall @entity1 from the presidency yet it should also be said : in @entity2 , the most important forms of vote fraud happen well before @entity16			1
first , the @entity1 regime systematically controls and manipulates the mass media , especially television			1
@entity40 , founder of the indispensable @entity42 blog writes in the @entity43 : " three minutes per day per broadcast outlet			0
that 's how much advertising each candidate is allowed in @entity2 in the weeks leading up to a presidential election			1
that 's six 30 - second spots , no more			2
to long - suffering tv watchers in @entity54 battleground states , that must sound like paradise			0
there 's a catch , though			0
while each candidate 's campaign is allowed no more than three minutes , the government can run as many ' institutional ' ads as it wants to promote its work			0
and in @entity64 ¡ vez - era @entity2 , such ads are generally indistinguishable from the official campaign ads , down to using designed - to - look - alike logos			1
" apart from campaign ads , however , the president himself can commandeer as much tv time as he wishes , although in the case of the long - winded @entity1 , such appearances may not be vote - winners			1
more relevant to the success of the president 's messaging is the regime 's habit of seizing tv stations that broadcast journalism of which the authorities disapprove			0
along with state media control goes massive government vote - buying			1
news : six more years with @entity1 the @entity86 reports : " @entity1 in recent months has solidified his support base with massive giveaway programs , including one that aims to build 200,000 housing units for @entity2 's poor			1
another , called @entity93 , or @entity94 , has donated @entity96 - made household appliances to tens of thousands of poor families			0
" the use of state oil funds for this kind of electioneering is driving @entity2 's budget deficit for the year to the astounding level of 20 % of @entity104 , an incredible figure for an oil - exporting economy at a time of very high oil prices			1
( context : the @entity54 budget deficits that have so alarmed people during the @entity111 years never reached as much as 9 % of gdp			0
) @entity2 politics is distorted most of all by a pervasive mood of threat			1
i visited @entity2 in 2010			2
my visit began with a briefing at the @entity54 embassy			0
" you 've been to @entity120 ? " yes			0
" you 've been to @entity121 ? " yes			0
this is the most dangerous place you 've ever been			0
" @entity2 , with a population smaller than @entity125 's , suffers more homicides than the @entity54			2
robberies at gunpoint -- " express kidnappings " as they are called -- are regular occurrences in middle - class neighborhoods			2
and if middle - class neighborhoods evince any disaffection from the regime , they lose what little police protection they have , or even discover the police suddenly abetting and aiding the criminals that prey upon their community			2
the @entity145 is policed , at least to the best of the ( very limited ) ability of @entity2 's not very competent security forces			1
@entity1 has laid @entity2 's economy to waste			1
one of the world 's great energy producers must turn its streetlamps off at night			0
one of the world 's wealthiest exporters can not afford to import enough food			0
one of the world 's energy superpowers is seeing its production slowly dwindle away because of chronic under - investment in the oil fields and the loss of access to technology as foreign companies are harassed and expropriated			0
did @entity2 vote for more of the same ? @entity1 does have a militant populist constituency , and it 's not impossible that the final result does reflect what the voters actually did			1
but then , @entity171 wins elections , too , and @entity173 won at least one			0
it is not elections alone that make a free society -- and a free society is what @entity2 long ago ceased to be			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity182 : @entity2 's @entity1 has won ; his system of rule *suspect* , sinister
he says @entity2 election fraud system *evident* in rigged media , vote - buying , police threat
he says robberies and eavesdropping routine , economy in awful shape under @entity1
@entity197 : did @entity2 really vote for this ? hard to say in a society like it
