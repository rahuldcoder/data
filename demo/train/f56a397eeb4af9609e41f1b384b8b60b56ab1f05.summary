@entity0 -- on a promenade that runs along @entity0 's harbor , crowds of tourists jostle for their chance to photograph the city 's spectacular skyline			1
but long after most have retired to their hotel rooms , one small group of visitors remains			2
the four men , who came from @entity13 in search of a better life , say they have been sleeping in the alcove of a building in @entity0 's @entity19 district for almost two months as they wait for their asylum claim to be processed			1
" lots of refugees in @entity0 live in the same conditions , " says @entity21 , chairman of @entity22 , a group that advocates for asylum seekers ' rights and helps them to find suitable housing in @entity0 as they wait to learn their fate			1
it 's a feeling that @entity31 , 30 , knows well			0
when he arrived in @entity0 in 2007 , he , too , was homeless and slept on the streets for months			1
for almost eight years , he has been battling what many see as the government 's indifference to the plight of refugees			0
frustrated by his own struggle against @entity0 's immigration system after fleeing @entity40 , he has become a champion for the rights of some of the city 's most vulnerable inhabitants			1
when he was just five years old @entity31 fled with his family to @entity47 after one of his brothers was shot dead during the country 's civil war			2
he worked as an engineer and made enough money to help support his parents , along with his four sisters and three brothers			0
but he was n't safe in @entity47 either , for reasons he wo n't disclose for fear of putting his family in danger			2
" the government wanted me dead , " he said			0
if he returns , he believes he will be incarcerated , tortured , or worse			0
in 2011 , after more than three years in @entity0 , the @entity62 recognized @entity31 as a refugee			1
since then he has been waiting for the organization to find a third country that will take him in			0
thousands living in limbo around 6,000 people are currently seeking asylum in @entity0 according to the territory 's @entity69			1
refugees can not work legally , which makes them dependent on the city 's welfare system			1
the lucky few whose claims are successful are resettled to another country			0
as @entity31 can attest it is an agonizing process that can take years			0
" as long as you do n't have a right to work , you do n't have anything to live on , " says @entity31			1
" you do n't have any future			2
you ca n't build your family 's future , your kids ' future			1
" authorities provide food parcels three times a month and a rental allowance , but some asylum seekers say the assistance is not enough to cover even their most basic needs			1
strength in unity in january this year , @entity31 and several dozen others like him founded the @entity22			0
the group advocates for the rights of asylum seekers , gives advice and legal assistance and helps people find accommodation			1
" we created the @entity22 to fight ... against the system with more power , " he said			0
" we have to fight together , because whatever i fight , another refugee is fighting for the same thing -- they suffer from the same thing			0
" in recent months , the group has held peaceful demonstrations in the heart of @entity0 's business district to raise awareness of their concerns and put pressure on authorities			1
" most of the refugees are afraid to complain , because they think if they complain , immigration will process their application faster and will reject them , ( or ) will cut their welfare allowance , " @entity31 said			0
since @entity22 began its campaign , the government has increased asylum seekers ' food and rent allowance , and given them additional funds for transportation , electricity and water			1
@entity31 says that the total assistance they receive still falls below the city 's poverty line			2
" @entity142 completely changed the asylum arena by coordinating individual protests into group action , " says @entity138 , executive director of @entity139 , an ngo that is giving the group advice and logistical support			2
" the goal is to empower refugees to speak up for themselves , support each other in solidarity and advocate for the changes that they desperately need because obviously collective bargaining beats solo endeavors			0
" improving lives in @entity0 , @entity31 lives with his wife in a cramped , one - room apartment that costs hk $ 2,800 ( $ 360 ) per month			2
she earns hk $ 4,000 ( $ 520 ) a month working as a domestic helper for a local family , but sends a large portion of her income back to her family in the @entity161			0
every day , @entity31 reads a sign that his wife has placed near their bed : " life is not about waiting for the storm to pass , but about learning how to dance in the rain			0
" he hopes one day to leave @entity0 and start a new life			2
until then , he is determined to help reform the city 's welfare system so that other asylum seekers are n't forced to live " like beggars			1
" " even though i can not do work ... it is better for me to give my time for them , to help them to improve their situation in @entity0 , " he said			1
