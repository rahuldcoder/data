-- a time capsule hidden for more than a hundred years at one of @entity4 's most popular tourist attractions was opened on friday in @entity4			1
according to the @entity8 , which maintains the 1713 - built @entity9 , the rectangular copper box containing a variety of artifacts from 1901 was sealed inside one of two iconic statues -- a lion and a unicorn -- that have been a familiar site atop the @entity9 for a couple of centuries			1
the @entity8 did n't -- or could n't -- fully divulge the 113 - year - old time capsule 's contents , explaining that " the process of extracting documents that are old and probably fragile will need to be slow and careful			2
" but a @entity22 article from february 24 , 1901 , detailed what went into the box , which the story predicted would " prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence			0
" according to the @entity22 , the box included the photographs and autographs of local statesmen such as @entity31 gov. @entity30 and @entity4 mayor @entity32 , as well as news clippings of the day from several city newspapers and even a " letter to posterity from the reporters of the @entity39 newspapers assigned to @entity40			1
" it also included a photograph of the " 5th @entity43 on its way to @entity45 to be mustered in as @entity47 volunteers for service in the war against @entity50 , " as well as " campaign buttons for @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 for vice president			0
" the box was sealed inside the lion 's head by @entity59 , a local coppersmith who was part of the crew renovating the nearly 200 - year - old @entity63			0
although the occasion was detailed in the city 's largest newspaper , the @entity8 said its current staff was unaware of the time capsule until they received a letter from a descendent of @entity59 alerting them to it .			0
