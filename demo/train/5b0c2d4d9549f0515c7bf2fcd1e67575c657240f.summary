-- it 's been sort of a rough week for @entity2			1
fresh on the heels of reports that activity on @entity4 's social network -- the tech giant 's effort to cut into @entity12 's empire -- has dropped sharply since its public rollout , a @entity4 engineer accidentally shared a memo calling the site " a knee - jerk reaction " and a " study in short - term thinking			1
" @entity2 , which launched by invitation only in june , has been a hit among so - called " tech elite " journalists , bloggers and others heavily immersed in the technology and social - networking world			2
but adoption by the general public , namely the people behind @entity12 's roughly 800 million accounts , has been slower			2
engineer @entity30 blames , in part , blames @entity4 's failure to share the site 's programming platform with developers who could have built games and other apps to make it a more robust online hangout			1
how do we know ? he accidentally shared what was supposed to be an internal memo with the world			2
" @entity2 is a knee - jerk reaction , a study in short - term thinking , predicated on the incorrect notion that @entity12 is successful because they built a great product , " @entity30 wrote in what was supposed to be an internal memo			1
" but that 's not why they are successful			0
@entity12 is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work			2
so @entity12 is different for everyone			0
" the post , which @entity30 deleted but is still being shared on other people 's @entity2 pages , says @entity12 's rich set of apps helps attract and keep users			1
" some people spend all their time on @entity66 , " he wrote			0
" some spend all their time on @entity67			0
there are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high - quality time sinks available , so there 's something there for everyone			0
" what 's worse is that , in a follow - up post , he mistakenly made the memo public because he 's " not what you might call an experienced @entity2 user			1
" the post said he 'd talked to @entity4 's public - relations department and it was understanding about his mistake			1
" ( @entity84 ) hey went out of their way to help me understand that we 're an opinionated company , and not one of the kinds of companies that censors their employees , " he wrote			0
the memo comes on the heels of a report from @entity94 , a web analytics firm , saying traffic on @entity2 has plummeted 60 % since it opened to the public on september 20			1
on that day , @entity94 reported , traffic spiked 1,200 % from before , when an invitation was required to join the network			0
but , just a week later , it had fallen back to roughly the same level it was before the public rollout			0
" it would appear that although high levels of publicity were able to draw new traffic to @entity2 , few of them saw reason to stay , " @entity106 said in its report , released friday			0
the firm puts forward two theories : 1 ) that the supply of social - media users is limited ( and , presumably , mostly already on @entity12 ) and 2 ) that while it has a " striking new interface , rapid release of new features , and focus on user interaction , " @entity2 does n't offer much that 's truly unique			1
while web analytics can be an imprecise science ( companies use different programs and , as such , often end up with different figures ) , the report spoke to the general perception of how the network has fared			0
to throw one more jab , tech blogs were noting with some degree of snark that @entity4 ceo @entity135 appears to have finally joined @entity2 -- more than three months after it was launched			2
@entity137 's @entity136 noted in an october 4 post that the low level of public usage by @entity4 's top brass ( he counted a total of 22 posts from co-founders @entity144 and @entity146 ) sends the wrong message			1
" it does n't matter how you slice it , " he wrote			0
" if @entity4 's management truly believed in @entity2 as the future of the company , they would be more engaged			2

@entity2 , *struggling* to catch on as a @entity12 *competitor* , is having a rough week
analytics firm says usage of the network has dropped 60 % since it became public
a @entity4 engineer accidentally shared a post calling @entity2 " a study in short - term thinking "
@entity167 's top brass has also taken hits for not publicly engaging on their site
