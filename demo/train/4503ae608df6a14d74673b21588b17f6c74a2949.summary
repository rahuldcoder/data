@entity0 -- everything about the rebooted @entity3 screams , " airplanes ! " even outside its entrance , i 'm greeted by aviation decorations			1
lined up in a row like @entity11 columns are three struts of @entity14 landing gear embedded into the front of the building			2
welcome to the @entity3 , home to some of the airline industry 's historic jewels , including a first - of - its - kind aircraft that pioneered the sophisticated planes we fly on today			1
this could be the best aviation museum you 've never heard of			2
i 'm champing at the bit to see a few highlights , including : the cockpit from the first @entity30 880 - 22 , once the world 's fastest airliner a nose - to - wing section of the first @entity34 that served as a @entity36 movie set the airline 's beloved " spirit of @entity3 , " a huge 1980s - era @entity14 767 arguably the world 's most meticulously restored @entity40 , among history 's most important airliners yep , it 's enough to make an aviation geek play hooky and get lost among all the sleek , metallic technology			1
but this place also appeals to nonaviation aficionados , thanks to its collection of stylish luggage and @entity3 uniforms			1
then there 's the museum 's @entity54 rescue project			1
i 'll tell you about that in a minute			2
for years access to the museum was limited to @entity3 employees and their friends			1
but last summer the airline closed it for a complete overhaul			0
in june , it opened to the public for the first time			2
appropriately , the museum takes up two hangars on @entity3 's corporate headquarters , next to @entity0 's @entity0			1
once you step inside , you 're met with an amazing 1940 @entity40 airliner called @entity74			0
when sunlight pours through the hangar windows , it bounces off the aluminum surface of this twin - propeller tail - dragger			0
beginning in the mid- 1930s , more than 14,000 commercial and military versions of the plane came off the @entity83 production lines , popularizing airline travel across much of @entity85			0
each @entity40 seated from 21 to 24 passengers			0
astonishingly , hundreds are still flying worldwide today thanks to an airframe that pilots describe as one of the toughest ever			0
the unbelievable airliner that just wo n't quit restoring this silver - skinned beauty was a triumph for a handful of retired @entity3 employees , who took it apart and rebuilt it in the 1990s , returning it to nearly as good as new			1
" no other @entity40 in the world has been restored with such attention to detail , " says the museum website			2
@entity3 says @entity100 is the first aircraft to earn an award from the @entity102			1
take a video tour inside the meticulously refurbished airliner next , take a walk through a darkened , circular portal and emerge into another hangar			0
suddenly , you 're sharing a room with a quarter - million - pound , five - story - tall @entity108 767 - 232			0
it 's right there in front of you , fully accessible for avgeeks who ca n't help caressing its underbelly and nuzzling up to its twin @entity121 engines			2
a few interesting facts about this plane : in a gesture of solidarity , @entity3 employees raised $ 30 million to purchase it for the airline during tough economic times in 1982			1
with a capacity of 204 passengers and six crew members , the plane flew until 2006 before retiring to the museum			2
when you get on board , you walk through a first class section that 's frozen in time			2
the armrests include passenger phones and audio controls			2
the bulkheads are decorated with pinstripes			0
a video screen is mounted on the wall			0
the sound system uses speakers mounted in the overhead bins			0
in the rear , the plane becomes a mini-museum , with displays featuring items like airline uniforms and insignia pins			0
just steps away sits the cockpit from the first @entity30 880 - 22 , serial number 01			1
the @entity30 880 was an unsung airliner classic , flying for @entity3 from 1960 to 1973			1
it was good enough for the king of rock ' n ' roll			0
@entity159 bought one in 1975 , naming it for his daughter , @entity163 , and painting on the letters " tcb			0
" just a little reminder that the plane was " @entity169			0
" the museum 's @entity30 cockpit was the nerve center for the very first 880 test plane			1
later the aircraft joined the fleet at @entity176			0
" some of the other jets we 'd compare to pickup trucks , but this was like a sports car -- like a @entity185 , " capt. @entity177 , a retired @entity178 pilot , told me			0
like a @entity185 , the jet was a speed demon , with a cruising speed of 586 mph , according to the museum			2
in 1959 , the 880 was known as the fastest airliner in the world , according to @entity192			0
three years later , @entity3 set a commercial speed record with an 880 , hitting 715 mph , according to the museum			1
that 's fast even by today 's standards			2
as @entity177 flew 880s in the ' 60s and ' 70s between @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 , the plane " was something you were proud to be in , " he recalled , calling it " the cream - of - the - crop " airliner			0
" the passengers loved it , and we loved it			0
" the museum also contains another piece of airline history you ca n't find anywhere else : a nose - to - wing section of the very first @entity34 , serial number 1001			1
oh , if this triple - engined jet could talk ! it might tell stories about the test flights it flew for @entity34 in the 1970s			1
or it might reveal tales about when it served as a movie set for 1992 's " @entity227 , " starring @entity228 , and @entity230 's " @entity229 " from 1990			2
pilots loved the @entity34 for its efficiency and reduced engine noise			1
for a while , it was sometimes called the @entity235			0
bottoms , who also flew l - 1011s , said both planes were so reliable they could almost land themselves under the right conditions			0
" they were such stable airplanes -- no wild gyrations of having to move the controls , " he said			0
the museum offers several handy touchscreens with all kinds of cool data about the planes			1
but the best interactive exhibit is an actual flight deck simulator that was used to train @entity3 737 - 200 pilots			1
if you 're over age 16 , a rare opportunity to " fly " the simulator for 45 minutes will cost you about $ 400			0
as you exit through the gift shop , notice another piece of history hanging above the doorway : a sign that reads simply , " @entity261			2
" it does n't mean much , until you know where it came from			0
@entity3 saved the sign from the now - demolished @entity268 , aka @entity269 , at @entity203 's @entity54			1
built by @entity271 in 1960 , the flying saucer - shaped building became a symbol of the excitement and glamor surrounding the early days of the @entity275			0
@entity3 operated the terminal after @entity271 folded in 1991 until the airport tore it down in 2013 to create an aircraft parking lot			1
the sign was too important to leave behind			1
it 's " iconic and seemed to beg to be preserved , " said @entity3 's @entity280			1
workers carefully took it apart and trucked it nearly a thousand miles to @entity0 , where @entity3 's @entity282 refurbished it to like - new condition , rewiring it with @entity285 lighting			1
it all adds up to a surprising number of one - of - a - kind exhibits for a small museum tucked between the airline 's corporate offices			1
even for folks who do n't get all hot and bothered about airplanes , it 's a spot worth visiting during a long airport layover .			1

@entity3 has recently opened near @entity0 's airport
exhibits include *prototypes* of important airliners , the @entity34 and *superfast* @entity30
museum offers an interesting tourist option during long layovers
