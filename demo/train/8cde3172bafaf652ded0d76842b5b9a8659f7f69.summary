@entity0 -- if @entity4 's @entity3 ascends as expected to the no. 2 @entity6 leadership position in the @entity7 , one thing is assured : he will be dogged by the ever - present political specter of immigration reform			1
@entity3 's backers are hastily shoring up support for his candidacy as majority leader , but so are immigration reform advocates who want to make clear to him their expectations for action			1
@entity18 jumps into race for @entity7 majority leader @entity21 drops bid to succeed @entity23 in @entity7 leadership " there is no reason for congressman @entity3 , as leader , not to take leadership on this issue , " said immigration reform activist @entity25 , president of @entity26			1
" everyone will expect it and demand it			0
and we will step up all of our activities as a whole			0
" such is the thorny predicament for the politically savvy lawmaker viewed as most likely to succeed @entity23 as majority leader			1
@entity23 's primary loss in @entity41 set in a motion a scramble for the position			0
then again , @entity3 , who actor @entity45 reportedly shadowed in preparing for his role as majority whip @entity47 in the @entity49 series " @entity7 , " is used to such plot twists			2
is @entity0 real life " @entity7 " ? @entity3 's own rapid rise is the stuff of a political soap opera			1
he is the boy from @entity55 who married his high school sweetheart and plunked down money he won in a lottery to start a deli			0
he used those earnings to go to college before entering politics			0
his boss , former @entity64 chairman @entity63 endorsed his young staffer to replace him in 2006			0
since then , @entity3 has easily won every subsequent re-election and has risen quickly â € ” and shrewdly , friends say â € ” through the @entity7 @entity6 's leadership ranks			2
he 's now considered the frontrunner for the majority leader 's job			1
" we 've been friends for many , many years now , but he looks at things differently , " said fellow @entity4 @entity72 rep. @entity72			2
" he has the foresight to know when to push and when not to push and he understands when 's the right time to get something done			0
" for example , @entity3 last year voted with many @entity79 , but not @entity72 , to defund the @entity82 administration 's efforts to halt the deportation of young immigrants in the military or in school			2
this year , he 's supporting @entity72 's measure to help provide a path to citizenship for young immigrants who are also members of the military			0
doing the math down but not done : @entity23 's loss not end for immigration reform that 's not to say there have n't been stumbles and miscalculations			1
@entity3 became the party whip soon after the @entity6 takeover of the @entity7			2
but his ability to count and rally votes behind leadership 's priorities were tested after partisan battles over raising the debt ceiling and funding food stamps			2
@entity3 's affability has been key to helping soothe ruffled feathers , friends say			1
fellow @entity4 rep. @entity110 counts @entity3 as " both a close friend and a respected colleague , " and he 's gotten a chance to see the would - be majority leader up close as they and others in the delegation worked together on issues of providing water to their @entity121 region as well as infrastructure needs , he told @entity1 in a statement			1
@entity3 often orders takeout and invites @entity7 members to his office to eat and talk about issues affecting their districts , their spouses and children , @entity72 said			2
" he invites members to his office and it 's like sitting around the family dinner table , " he said			0
" he also takes the time to go to people 's districts all across the nation			0
" a tale of two republicans : a story of the @entity6 and immigration reform careful calculations friends say @entity3 , 49 , will need that personal touch for crafting relationships and a sense of timing on hot button issues , should he be elected leader next thursday			1
that 's because fallout from tackling immigration reform could prove politically perilous if @entity23 , who has endorsed @entity3 , is any indication			1
@entity153 used @entity23 's willingness to consider a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants to hammer home his point that he 'd lost touch with his constituents			0
that , analysts say , was crucial to his victory in the reliably conservative @entity167 - area district			0
" i think his ( @entity3 's ) views on immigration are similar to @entity23 's , " said @entity168 , director of research for the non-profit @entity170			1
" but after this week 's results , it seems much less likely he would push it			0
and even less likely still that he would move his members to push it			0
" conservatives are pushing aggressively to have one of their own fill @entity3 's current job as whip and join the @entity7 @entity6 leadership ranks , which would create an interesting dynamic between the top two @entity6 in the @entity7 and the whip			1
@entity6 " trapped " by amnesty @entity3 's home turf is @entity4 's 23rd congressional district , a @entity6 stronghold ripe with lush farmland in the shadow of mountain ranges			1
it is also a place that is 35 % latino and where the local business community has made clear that it depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick such crops as grapes , oranges and tomatoes			2
" we have spoken with congressman @entity3 and his staff about immigration reform and its importance to our local and regional economy , " @entity202 , president and ceo of the @entity204 told @entity1 in a statement			1
" i led a delegation of several other business leaders in a meeting with congressman @entity3 last fall in @entity0 , to discuss the issue			0
he expressed at that time and has since reaffirmed his commitment to a step - by - step assessment and overhaul of the system that is clearly broken			0
" in the meantime , immigration advocates who have hosted protests and sit - ins at @entity3 's district offices in the past vow they are poised to do so again if they sense he 's unwilling to tackle reform			1
" as the person responsible for scheduling @entity7 votes , when it comes to immigration reform @entity3 will either be a hero or a zero , " @entity230 , executive director of @entity231 , an immigration reform advocacy group , said in a statement			1
" he can save the @entity6 from itself by quickly scheduling a vote on historic legislation that the majority of the @entity7 , the country and even his district supports ; or he can squander the opportunity			0
... the future of the @entity6 may well hinge on his choice , " he said			0
