-- an ex-girlfriend of slain murder suspect @entity2 said the former @entity4 policeman worked in a pressure cooker and she was afraid he would target her after she heard he was the object of a manhunt			1
" it was very scary , and , you know , i made a decision to speak out because if anything had happened to me , i 'd want my family to at least have an idea about maybe who it was , " @entity8 told @entity0 on thursday			1
authorities say @entity2 launched a guerrilla war against the @entity17 over what he considered his unfair dismissal in 2009			1
he allegedly fatally shot four people and was killed in a fire at a cabin in @entity23 , @entity24 , when he was cornered after a manhunt			0
@entity2 's body positively id 'd if she stayed silent , her family would never have known what happened to her , she said , though she noted that she was n't singled out or named in the manifesto he wrote detailing his grievances			2
hearing that @entity2 was a murder suspect shocked her , @entity8 said			1
but at the same time , she " sort of expected it " from the man she dated in 2006			2
" when you have a profession where you worked your whole life to really obtain something , that level of success , and i think , when you go into that environment where everyone else is not , maybe , lined up with the way you believe and the way you think , after ... time ... the stress could probably wear on you , " she said			1
" i do n't think it 's in any way justifiable , someone going out and killing anyone because they 're stressed out at work			0
there are ways and outlets of releasing stress			0
@entity59 , unfortunately , was one of those people , he bottled up a lot of his emotions and was n't very good at expressing himself			1
" @entity2 is thought to have been proficient and comfortable with firearms			2
" he would come over to my house and sometimes there would be firearms laying around			0
i just attribute that to him being a peace officer and protecting himself at that time , you know , " she said			0
" there would just be , like , a firearm in the kitchen , there would be one by the bed			0
i guess just maybe for easier access in case something happened			0
