-- the 2010 television series " the @entity2 : a @entity6 " may not have lasted long , but fans might not be convinced that the clan has vanished from reality tv			1
that 's because the family 's latest woes are playing out in the public arena -- very much like one might expect from such a series			1
there is tension , drama , a reported scuffle and plenty of people tuning in ( though in this case to @entity19 ) for the latest action			2
in the past few days there has been a dispute regarding the whereabouts of the family 's 82 - year - old matriarch , @entity24			1
her nephew reported her missing and her granddaughter @entity30 has taken to her @entity19 account to lament the lack of contact with her grandmother			0
@entity24 has been the legal guardian for @entity30 and her two brothers since the children 's father , @entity36 , died three years ago			1
judge suspends @entity24 as guardian of @entity36 's children other relatives , including @entity42 , denied that @entity24 was missing and insisted she was resting on doctor 's orders			1
@entity46 's detectives closed the missing persons case opened for the elder @entity36 after she was discovered to be with her eldest daughter @entity48 in @entity49			1
she has reportedly since called home			0
but the closing of the case has apparently not ended family tensions			2
on tuesday , @entity0 obtained surveillance video which appeared to show @entity30 ' superstar aunt , @entity55 , attempting to take the 14 - year - old 's cell phone from her			2
authorities reportedly broke up a scuffle at the @entity61 home following that event			0
@entity64 , brothers inspired by famous uncle now there is much speculation over whether the root of the issue is tied to the massive estate left in the wake of @entity36 's death , a 20 % share of which belongs to his mother			1
" money always brings out the worst in people , " said @entity76 , a senior editor for @entity77			0
" @entity36 was a hot mess in life , and things are still really messy in death			1
" @entity76 noted the great lengths to which the late pop star went to shield his children from just the type of publicity and notoriety that they are now immersed in			0
@entity36 would often employ disguises for his children when they were younger , and very few details of their lives were shared			2
@entity30 , prince @entity36 and " blanket " ( as the youngest is known ) are now much more visible , and @entity76 pointed out that @entity30 ' reported aspirations to be an actress mean she plans to stay that way			2
" it 's ironic given how @entity36 protected those children and kept them from the spotlight and now @entity30 is wanting that spotlight , " he said			1
" @entity30 is tweeting and people are learning from @entity30			0
" @entity36 family feud caught on tape rabbi @entity105 befriended @entity36 in the 1990s and is the author of the book " the @entity108			1
" @entity105 said the jackson family has long struggled with fame , and hence @entity36 went out of his way to try and help his children avoid such pitfalls			1
" there 's no question that fame took @entity36 's life , " @entity105 said			1
" what @entity36 wanted in shielding his children was protecting them from all that had happened to him			2
he was denied a childhood , and he wanted them to have the most special childhood			0
" @entity105 -- who said he has not been in contact with the @entity61 for years -- said he had high hopes for the children when @entity24 first took custody of them because she is a deeply devout @entity127			0
" religion means you focus on things that are larger than yourself and you subordinate your ego to something larger than yourself , " he said			0
" that 's one of the remedies to the corruption of celebrity -- that there is something bigger than you			0
" @entity141 @entity140 , the author of " the cult of celebrity : what our fascination with the @entity147 @entity145 " and the co-host of the " @entity151 " podcast , said fans are fascinated by how the @entity61 dynamic is playing out because so many people have grown up with them			0
@entity24 returns home after losing guardianship as the next generation of @entity2 , @entity30 and her brothers are continuing to keep the public enthralled , @entity140 said			2
@entity30 , especially , has been very vocal on @entity19 about the fact that she believes her grandmother was being kept from them and she refuses to stand for it			0
" i follow @entity30 on @entity19 which is so strange because she is only 14 , " @entity140 said			0
" but i find her incredibly interesting , lucid and mature			0
i like that she does n't just lay down and take it			0
she recognizes at such a young age that most of the adults around her are children and behave like children , and she 's taken that role that she 's the adult and she 's calling them out on their immaturities			0
" regardless of how the drama plays out , @entity105 said he believes @entity36 's desire to leave a legacy in which children -- including his -- are celebrated and protected is being overlooked			1
" if you look at his legacy now it 's his music , which is beautiful , it 's his concerts and it 's this money that people are arguing over , " @entity105 said			2
" i believe that some of this dysfunction would be alleviated if there was an agreement on what is @entity36 's legacy , and that was pursued			1
