@entity0 -- @entity2 is looking into allegations that @entity5 linguists have been eavesdropping on @entity6 abroad			1
government linguists say the @entity6 eavesdropped on @entity6 , including military officers serving in @entity9			1
the congressional oversight committees said thursday that the @entity6 targeted included military officers in @entity9 who called friends and family in the @entity6			2
the allegations were made by two former military intercept operators on a television news report thursday evening			0
a terrorist surveillance program instituted by the @entity18 administration allows the intelligence community to monitor phone calls between the @entity6 and overseas without a court order -- as long as one party to the call is a terror suspect			1
@entity25 , a former @entity27 @entity26 linguist , told @entity28 the @entity5 was listening to the phone calls of @entity6 military officers , journalists and aid workers overseas who were talking about " personal , private things with @entity6 who are not in any way , shape or form associated with anything to do with terrorism			1
" @entity41 , a former @entity42 @entity26 linguist , said in the news report that he and his colleagues were listening to the conversations of military officers in @entity9 who were talking with their spouses or girlfriends in the @entity6			1
according to @entity41 , they would often share the contents of some of the more salacious calls stored on their computers , listening to what he called " phone sex " and " pillow talk			1
" both @entity25 and @entity41 worked at the @entity5 listening facility at @entity58 , @entity59			2
they told @entity28 that when linguists complained to supervisors about eavesdropping on personal conversations , they were ordered to continue transcribing the calls			1
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity65 said the agency 's inspector general has investigated some of the allegations and found them " unsubstantiated			0
" other accusations are still being looked at , she said			0
the @entity5 operates in " strict accordance with @entity6 laws and regulations , " she said			1
" any allegation of wrongdoing by employees is thoroughly investigated " and if misconduct is discovered , " we take swift and certain remedial action			0
" @entity80 director @entity79 , who was the head of the @entity5 when the terrorist surveillance program began , has always maintained that private conversations of @entity6 are not intercepted and if it should happen inadvertently , the name is removed from the record			1
" at @entity5 , the law was followed assiduously , " said @entity79 's spokesman , @entity86			0
" the notion that gen. @entity79 sanctioned or tolerated illegalities of any sort is ridiculous on its face			0
" author @entity92 was the first to interview the two former @entity5 linguists for his new book , " @entity95 , " which will be published next week			2
@entity92 told @entity1 the accounts from the whistle - blowers demonstrate the @entity5 was listening to the private conversations of @entity6 , transcribing them and keeping them			1
" they do n't delete them , " he said			0
@entity92 has written two other books on the @entity5 and was a party to an unsuccessful @entity103 lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the @entity105			0
the @entity103 issued a statement on thursday saying the allegations show that the government " misled the @entity6 public about the scope of its surveillance activities			2
" the @entity28 report " is an indictment not only of the @entity18 administration , but of all of those political leaders , @entity116 and @entity117 , who have been saying that the executive branch can be trusted with surveillance powers that are essentially unchecked , " said @entity103 official @entity120			0
@entity123 chairman @entity122 , @entity124 , called the allegations " extremely disturbing			0
" " anytime there is an allegation regarding abuse of the privacy and civil liberties of @entity6 , it is a very serious matter , " said @entity122 , adding that his committee is prepared to take whatever action is necessary to ensure the government is following the strict procedures to protect @entity6 citizens against unwarranted surveillance			2
a @entity139 spokesman said the panel has been in contact with the @entity5 and is awaiting the agency 's response .			0
