@entity0 -- both political parties continued jockeying sunday to position themselves as more deserving of the female vote , a battle that took on new life last week after a @entity8 strategist questioned @entity10 's validity in giving her husband advice on economic issues affecting women			1
the criticism from @entity15 , also a @entity1 contributor , rekindled the national conversation on whether @entity18 or @entity8 are better equipped to improve economic conditions for women and gave @entity18 a line of attack against @entity8			1
polls show a majority of female voters favor president @entity26 over presumptive @entity18 nominee @entity27			1
treasury secretary @entity28 defended the @entity26 administration 's record on job creation and accused @entity27 of leveling " ridiculous " accusations against the president 's policies			1
he specifically pointed to @entity27 's claim that 92.3 % of jobs lost in the country were among women			1
" it 's a ridiculous and deeply misleading look at the economy , " @entity28 said on @entity40 's " @entity39			2
" " remember the recession and the crisis started at the beginning of 2008 before the president took office			0
it caused a huge amount of damage to men , to women , to families			0
and the damage lasted for a time , and you 're still seeing the scars of that			0
" the 92.3 % figure was batted back and forth to jab @entity26 in the latest skirmish in the war over women			2
although the number is correct , when including non-farm - employed women from january 2009 -- when @entity26 took office -- to march 2012 , women have gained 863,000 jobs since february 2010			2
the percentage also does not reflect that men constituted a much larger chunk of the job - loss pie in the year leading up to @entity26 's inauguration			1
@entity28 stressed the downturn " hurt everybody , " and unsurprisingly rallied behind the president 's proposals , including the " @entity74 , " which he said is part of a comprehensive plan that will continue to improve the country 's economic outlook			1
but @entity27 backers , including sen. @entity83 of @entity84 and rep. @entity85 of @entity0 , argued that the former @entity87 governor is armed with proposals that will not only court female voters , but also turn the economy around			2
@entity83 , the 2008 @entity18 presidential nominee , predicted @entity27 would win the female vote , despite the gender gap in current polling			2
" i do believe that @entity10 was right when she said the women she talks to and the women i talk to , traveling around my state , are interested in jobs and the economy , " @entity83 said on @entity95 ' " @entity94			2
" " there 's no doubt that a lot of women have been hurt very badly in this recession			0
and jobs and the economy is their no. 1 priority			0
" a recent poll from @entity110 / @entity109 showed @entity26 leading @entity27 among women , 57 % to 38 % , despite his single - digit lead among all voters over the former @entity87 governor in a hypothetical general - election matchup			1
@entity10 , a mother of five , came to her own defense and the defense of her husband on thursday after @entity15 questioned her qualifications for advising her husband , given she had " never worked a day in her life			0
" @entity15 later apologized for her comments , but not before igniting a firestorm			0
@entity15 responds to firestorm over @entity10 comment @entity125 , who was one of the women dispatched by the @entity27 campaign to capitalize on @entity15 's comment last week , told @entity1 chief political correspondent @entity129 that her candidate 's policies will " help women succeed in this country and all people in this country succeed			1
" " president @entity26 's policies are the ones that are failing , @entity140 failing women , " she added on @entity1 's " @entity139			1
" opinion : not another @entity143 after calling @entity15 's comments " shocking and insulting , " rep. @entity144 of @entity145 returned to the @entity18 line , saying " women have born the brunt of the failed economic policies under @entity26			1
" " there 's no question his economic policies have had a disproportionate negative impact on women and that 's why i think women are going to be very upset with this current administration , " the former presidential candidate said on @entity40 's " @entity39			0
" the back - and - forth over female support is the latest @entity163 - and cable - fed controversy to show the general election between @entity27 and @entity26 is already under way			2
@entity15 : it 's not personal , it 's politics on @entity1 's " @entity139 , " @entity169 chairman @entity168 would not yet characterize @entity27 as the " presumptive nominee " out of respect for former house speaker @entity172 and rep. @entity173 of @entity174 , who remain in the race			0
however , @entity27 's significant advantages on all fronts make it highly likely he will face @entity26 for the presidency			1
newly into the second quarter of fund - raising , both @entity27 and @entity26 will travel in the coming week in hopes of aiding their campaign coffers			1
the president , first lady @entity185 and vice president @entity186 will all hold fund - raising events in the next week			0
@entity26 is scheduled to campaign in @entity188 , while his wife will be in @entity0 , @entity190 and @entity191			0
@entity186 will host events in @entity0 , @entity84 and @entity193			0
@entity27 , too , will attempt to bring in money through events in @entity196 and @entity191			0
@entity10 is scheduled host a birthday - themed fund - raiser in @entity199 on tuesday , one day after she and her husband sit down for a joint interview with @entity110 set to air monday night .			0
