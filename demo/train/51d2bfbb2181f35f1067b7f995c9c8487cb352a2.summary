@entity0 -- do n't post rumors -- or else			2
that was @entity5 's message to millions of micro-bloggers recently , when @entity8 's leading content portal warned it will penalize users if they find them spreading false rumors on their @entity12 account			1
@entity12 is @entity13 - like social media service , which boasts of 200 million registered users			1
speaking at the @entity8 @entity16 recently , @entity5 's ceo @entity15 pledged to curb irresponsible rumors			1
" @entity12 is a microcosm of a big society and a society needs to be properly managed by regulations , " he said			0
@entity15 said @entity13 has been working to set up a " credibility system , " which would rate @entity12 posts			1
this , @entity15 said , will " spread the real valuable information and punish those who make up rumors			1
" the punishment includes imposing a temporary freeze on @entity12 accounts , from one week to one month			0
observers of @entity8 's new media industry say this is another attempt by @entity0 to tighten the control of the internet			1
earlier this year , @entity8 bloggers battled through targeted internet censorship in the wake of dissident artist @entity39 's release after nearly three months in police custody			2
on @entity12 words with the slightest linkage to @entity39 were banned , including " release , " " @entity39 " and " the fat guy			0
" the phrase " love the future , " which looks and sounds like his name in @entity48 , was also blocked			0
" there has been government concern about the way the internet spreads information for years , " says @entity0 - based media observer @entity50			2
" @entity13 , like all internet companies , has no choice but to work with the government , which is something they have always been good at doing			1
" in august , @entity13 sent out " notices " to all users citing reports circulating in cyberspace that were untrue			1
one claimed that the @entity65 has been selling blood to @entity8 hospitals at 200 yuan per pack even though it had been donated for free			0
@entity12 also set up an account intended to refute malicious rumors circulating among netizens			1
in a public statement issued in early september , @entity5 said @entity75 would " ensure the authenticity " of information across the site			1
" after the @entity78 train accident , which saw a frenzy of angry posts on @entity12 , the government wants internet companies to make sure that their websites do not pose any threat to social stability , " said @entity50			2
the high - speed train collision killed 39 people and sparked a massive outpouring of anger directed at officials for their handling of the crash			0
much of that outrage played out on @entity12			0
@entity12 has long played host to fierce online debates about corruption and social injustice in @entity8 -- a delicate balancing act between meeting the expectations of a web audience accustomed to speaking their minds and not offending the @entity8 government to the point of a shut - down			0
" @entity13 and other companies will have to regulate themselves and decide , in real time , what kinds of information to police , " said @entity50			1
but he said it is unclear what criteria would be used to identify the rumors to censor			2
in a recent interview with @entity1 , the @entity5 founder declined to offer specific numbers about how many @entity13 employees were managing and censoring @entity12 content , but he conceded that " there are people working in terms of looking at the content itself and the message itself			1
" there are a lot of rumors on the micro-blog itself , a lot of fraud on the micro-blog			0
there are a lot of things we need to take care of			0
" as if to reinforce that point , @entity139 chief @entity138 recently visited @entity13 and @entity141 , @entity8 's leading video sharing website			2
according to the @entity143 , he urged them to " firmly end fake and harmful information " and to use new technology to " solve problems of online video management			0
" he added : " internet companies should work to get rid of damaging or untruthful information and help to create a healthy positive online environment			0
