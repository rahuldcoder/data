international broadcaster @entity0 says it has closed its @entity2 - language bureau in @entity3 after @entity5 authorities refused to renew the press credentials of correspondent @entity7			1
the broadcaster expressed disappointment with @entity5 's decision , which it said came after repeated attempts to apply for a visa through the normal procedures			1
it said it had no choice but to close the bureau because @entity5 had also denied its requests for a correspondent to replace @entity19			2
" we are committed to our coverage of @entity5 , " @entity20 , director of news at @entity22 , said in an article on the broadcaster 's website			0
" @entity28 will continue to work with the @entity5 authorities in order to reopen our @entity3 bureau			2
" @entity0 's arabic - language bureau in @entity3 will continue to operate normally , said @entity32 , the bureau chief			1
at a @entity34 news conference tuesday , spokesman @entity33 said @entity5 welcomes objective reporting from foreign journalists , describing the reporting environment as " very open and free			1
" " at the same time , " he said , " foreign journalists should abide by @entity5 laws and regulations while reporting in @entity5 and follow the professional ethics			1
" he added : " we have been dealing with relevant media and foreign journalists in accordance with relevant laws and regulations as well as the actual performance of the journalist			1
" @entity19 , a @entity50 citizen , is thought to be the first accredited foreign correspondent to lose the right to report in @entity5 since the expulsion of @entity54 , a reporter for @entity57 's @entity56 newspaper , in october 1998			1
@entity5 authorities have yet to comment on the reasons for @entity19 's visa denial			2
the @entity61 of @entity5 ( @entity62 ) suggested the ban was related to the airing of an @entity0 documentary in november on forced labor camps in @entity5			2
in a statement on its website tuesday , the @entity62 -- of which @entity19 is a board member -- referred to @entity5 " anger " over the report , which it said @entity19 " did n't even play a part in making			2
" the report was part of a documentary series called " slavery : a 21st @entity76 , " which accused @entity5 of " state - sponsored " slavery by forcing prison inmates to work			0
the @entity5 authorities " have also expressed unhappiness with the general editorial content on @entity22 and accused ms. @entity7 of violating rules and regulations that they have not specified , " the @entity62 said			2
the @entity84 said tuesday that it has been closely following @entity19 's case			0
" we 're disappointed in the @entity5 government and how the @entity5 government decided not to renew her accreditation , " @entity84 spokesman @entity86 told reporters			1
" to our knowledge , she operated and reported in accordance with @entity5 law , including regulations that permit foreign journalists to operate freely in @entity5			1
" during her five years at @entity0 's @entity3 bureau , @entity19 has filed nearly 400 reports on a variety of subjects including the economy , domestic politics , foreign policy , the environment , social justice , labor rights and human rights , the broadcaster said			1
in one report in 2010 , @entity19 was blocked by authorities as she tried to visit the wife of jailed @entity5 nobel peace laureate @entity114			0
the following year , she profiled artist @entity115 , who was painting thousands of portraits of corrupt @entity5 officials			0
and as recently as march this year , @entity19 accompanied an angry family as they tried to find relatives they claimed had been " disappeared " and detained at @entity5 's so - called " black jails			2
" the @entity62 said it was " appalled " by the decision to block @entity19 's visa application , which it called " the most extreme example of a recent pattern of using journalist visas in an attempt to censor and intimidate foreign correspondents in @entity5			1
" there is no suggestion the decision to deny @entity19 a visa is related to recent reporting on the scandal engulfing former @entity137 party chief @entity136 or the attempts by the blind activist @entity139 to leave the country			0
video : @entity5 blocks @entity143 report on @entity139 @entity19 confirmed on @entity144 that she no longer has reporting rights in @entity5 , saying , " yes my press credentials have been revoked and i will no longer report f / @entity5			0

the @entity50 - based @entity156 ( @entity156 ) urged @entity5 to " immediately grant " a visa to @entity22 correspondents , adding that the refusal to approve @entity19 's application " marks a real deterioration in @entity5 's media environment			1
" " surveillance and harassment are the norm for reporters on the @entity5 beat , and authorities will often delay visa approval or threaten to revoke it as part of an overall strategy of intimidation			0
but effectively shuttering an international news outlet is a disturbing development , " @entity172 , @entity173 program coordinator , says in a statement on the organization 's website			0
according to the @entity180 of @entity5 's @entity181 , 649 accredited journalists were working in @entity5 as of february 2012			1
most were based in @entity3 , filing reports for 423 news organization from 58 countries			0
citing its own survey and additional research , the @entity62 said that in the past two years , 27 foreign reporters were made to wait for more than four months for visa approvals , with 13 of those of waiting six months or more			0
it claimed that 28 permanent postings or reporting trips had been canceled since 2009 because the @entity5 authorities had rejected or ignored applications for the relevant visas			0
a recent report from the @entity195 detailed what the nonprofit called a " clampdown on media in @entity5 in 2011 , " describing harassment of reporters and a growing push toward internet censorship			0
" the online media is still the main target for government crackdowns , with a new body established to oversight the online media environment , " the report said			0
