-- princess @entity4 's suggestion that @entity5 need to reconsider their reluctance to eat horse meat was " brave " and reflects a sad decline in horses ' value , the head of a horse welfare charity says			1
addressing the @entity12 conference thursday , @entity4 -- @entity14 's daughter and the organization 's president -- suggested that making horse meat more valuable might lead to better treatment of the animals			1
the @entity21 equestrian referred to the transport of horses from countries such as @entity25 , the source of some horse meat , saying many horses left looking " absolutely wonderful " but suffered in transit			1
" it 's worth noting transport of horses itself is the problem -- not the horses or indeed the way they were brought up , " she said			2
" if that 's true then and they value their horses -- they look after them well because they 're in the horse meat trade -- and it 's the transport that 's the problem , should we be considering a real market for horse meat , and would that reduce the number of welfare cases ? " the princess suggested that " our attitudes to the horse meat trade ... and the value of horse meat might have to change			1
" " i chuck that out for what it 's worth because i think it needs a debate , " she said			0
she noted that @entity5 's attitude to horse meat was not universal			1
" as i was reminded , not so long ago , by somebody who 'd traveled in @entity62 , the most expensive piece of meat in the local butcher was a fillet of horse meat , " she said			1
" the value of the animal to every individual is slightly different , but if it has real financial value , then you look a little bit further ahead in the way in which you look after your animals			0
" @entity12 chief executive @entity76 said the princess royal had made her point " within the context of the equine crisis we 're currently in " when ponies are being sold for as little as Â £ 5 ( $ 8 )			1
" around 7,000 horses are currently at risk of abandonment and neglect and charities like ours are struggling to cope as winter approaches , " @entity76 said in a statement			0
" the economic downturn has driven prices for horses and ponies to rock bottom , and the sad fact is that from a purely economic perspective , they can now be worth more as meat			2
" many in the horse world have known this for a long time			0
our president has been brave enough to say this openly in hopes of generating a thought - provoking debate			0
" overbreeding in @entity5 the underlying problem , @entity76 told @entity0 , was the issue of overbreeding in @entity5			2
" there are too many horses and too few homes			2
" @entity76 said he believed @entity4 was caring but also practical			2
" she was n't actually saying , ' get out there and buy horse meat			1
' she was saying , ' we should be open to the debate about it -- and if the horse goes into the food chain , will it reduce welfare problems ? ' " @entity76 said the option of sending a horse to a slaughterhouse was one that should be available to people			2
" the issue is not those horses going to an abattoir -- it 's not that they 're going to slaughter that 's the problem -- it 's that they are simply not fit and healthy when they reach there , " he said			0
@entity76 said he knew of people delaying euthanizing horses because they could n't afford the expense to call out a vet and to dispose of a carcass			0
emotional issue @entity5 has a different attitude toward horses than some of its @entity145 neighbors , with the idea of eating horse meat an emotional one , he said			1
" on the continent they are viewed as farm animals to a far greater degree ; here they are seen as pets , leisure or sport animals			0
" the debate would be different if horses were regarded in the same light as pigs , sheep or cows , he said			0
" as a country we have eaten horse meat in the past -- we did in the @entity168 , but you could argue that it was a time of crisis , " @entity76 said			1
@entity5 's @entity172 for the @entity173 and @entity174 said it welcomed any debate on horse welfare issues			1
" our centers , and those of other charities , are overflowing with horses which have been abandoned , neglected and abused , and we are struggling to keep up with the demands for our help , " it said in a statement			0
" the killing of horses for meat is an emotive subject as many see them as companion animals rather than a food source , a sentiment the @entity193 has great sympathy with			0
" however , the @entity172 's primary concern for all animals killed for meat and otherwise is that they are cared for , handled and transported in a way which safeguards their welfare at all times			0
