-- critics everywhere have hailed " @entity3 " as an important , engaging documentary			1
@entity0 's @entity4 calls it " sensitive and eye - opening " ; the film has also earned a near - perfect 93 percent " fresh " rating from the reviews aggregated by @entity8			0
but in an article posted late last week , @entity12 's @entity11 alleged that some crucial parts of " @entity3 " are " utterly one - sided " and " factually questionable			1
" her piece focused on @entity16 , one of the doc 's featured subjects ; when he was just 17 , @entity16 took his own life , apparently because he was bullied by his classmates			1
but according to @entity11 , that is n't the whole story			0
she wrote that @entity16 also suffered from @entity24 , bipolar disorder , and @entity27 's syndrome ; additionally , his girlfriend broke up with him a few weeks before his suicide			2
it seems likely that these factors contributed to @entity16 's decision to commit suicide , @entity11 wrote			1
she asserted that by not mentioning them -- and by possibly exaggerating the treatment @entity16 received in school â € ” director @entity37 and producer @entity38 oversimplified and distorted the facts to create a smoother narrative			2
@entity38 responded to the allegations with an exclusive statement to @entity0 : " due to its glaring inaccuracies , misinformation and lack of journalistic integrity -- the filmmakers of ' bully ' would like to respond to @entity11 's ' @entity49 with @entity3			1
' we are deeply disappointed by the author 's neglect to gain a clear picture of @entity16 's bullying in the @entity55 , which is currently under investigation by the @entity57 regarding allegations of ongoing bullying and harassment			1
@entity11 suggests that @entity16 was not bullied in the days , weeks and months before his death			1
there are literally hundreds of bullying events and incidents that have been testified to under oath by his fellow students			0
multiple students testified he was bullied on a " daily basis , " and the pleadings reflect constant bullying his junior year , including the very day he killed himself			0
@entity11 erroneously cites @entity16 's prior health history and its significance to the case : he was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder , and @entity27 is not a recognized risk factor for suicide			1
that @entity16 was on the autism spectrum is never something the filmmakers have hidden , it is something we have discussed in many interviews and post-viewing q&a 's			2
the fact that @entity16 was on the spectrum does not reduce the school system 's responsibility to provide a safe learning environment			2
as filmmakers we felt that was the bottom line			0
for this very reason , we chose not to introduce his autism in the film			0
the filmmakers are dismayed by @entity11 's failure to reach out to either the long family or their legal counsel , so that they may have had the opportunity to address the @entity55 's assertions			2
" when presented with @entity38 's statement , @entity12 deputy editor @entity105 responded with one of her own : " @entity11 's central concern about ' @entity3 , ' expressed in her review for @entity12 , is that the movie presents a one - sided and incomplete version of the events leading up to the suicide of @entity16			1
the movie includes no mention of the mental health issues @entity16 faced , and it fails to note that the school district disputes the long family 's account of the causal role bullying played his death			1
the school district 's legal papers tell us that @entity16 was diagnosed with @entity24 , bipolar disorder , and @entity27 's when he was in sixth grade , and while the family 's response brief objects to the bipolar diagnosis as " immaterial , " it does not factually challenge it			2
perhaps more important for this conversation , no one disputes that @entity16 was on the autism spectrum , and considerable research links @entity27 's and autism to an elevated risk of suicide			0
( more helpful information on that here			0
) @entity11 has covered bullying for @entity12 for a few years now			1
her reporting has taught her how complicated the issues around it can be , especially in the tragic cases when a student takes his or her own life			0
and her interviews with suicide prevention experts have taught her how important it is to avoid oversimplifying the facts , which can make suicide look romantic or appealing , especially to teen viewers			0
@entity11 's review was not intended to endorse the school district 's view ; merely to point out that an alternative viewpoint exists , and that the movie had a responsibility to address it			1
" @entity3 is currently showing in five theaters in @entity159 and @entity160 ; @entity161 plans to expand that number to up to 150 theaters in the next few weeks			0
