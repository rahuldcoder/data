-- how much would it cost to save tigers from extinction in the wild ? thirty - five million more dollars a year			2
some perspective on this amount : thirty - five million dollars is less than soccer star @entity7 earns annually			2
surely , a world that sustains great athletes with princely sums can also afford to save this princely beast			0
it 's zero hour for tigers			2
in the past century , the world 's wild tiger population has fallen by a staggering 97 percent -- from an estimated 100,000 to an all - time low of 3,200 animals			1
of these , only 1,000 are breeding females			0
tigers are threatened across their entire range , from @entity20 to the @entity21			0
they face a triple threat : poachers kill them for their pelts and body parts , hunters kill their prey , and development encroaches on their habitat			0
@entity32 extinction would be the stuff of great tragedy			0
but hopes for averting such disaster may emerge from a summit happening this week in @entity38 , @entity39			1
called together by @entity21 prime minister @entity44 , conservationists , donors and leaders of all 13 tiger range states may decide the fate of tigers in the wild			1
the @entity48 and its partners in big cat conservation have devised a strategy that offers the summit a practical plan of action to reverse the decline of tigers and put the population on a course for recovery			1
( this is where the $ 35 million comes in ; more on that in a moment			1
) this fall , the @entity48 published a peer - reviewed study identifying 42 " source sites " across the natural range of tigers in @entity68 , where viable populations of breeding tigers now exist			1
the paper was co-authored by conservationists from organizations including the @entity74 , the @entity75 , @entity76 , the @entity77 and numerous other partners			2
the study suggests that managing and financing activities like law enforcement and training in these breeding areas will protect tiger populations and allow them to repopulate larger landscapes			2
implementing this plan would be straightforward			2
instead of spreading conservation efforts thinly across large landscapes , the focus would shift to source sites			0
these are where 70 percent of the world 's tigers live in just 6 percent of their current range			2
for example , there are 18 source sites in @entity20 , eight in @entity99 , six in @entity39 , three in both @entity100 and @entity101 , two in @entity102 and one in both @entity104 and @entity105			1
protecting these sites would halt the decline in tigers and allow populations to recover			0
can it be done ? in fact , something similar is being done in southwest @entity20 in one of the most densely populated places on earth			0
in the @entity116 of @entity117 sits @entity118 , where the @entity48 , the @entity20 government and local communities have worked together for 20 years , joining first - rate science to public action			1
trained enforcement teams have deployed to protect both tigers and their prey from such threats as poaching and habitat loss			0
voluntary resettlement to shift people away from protected areas and the cooperation of those who live in local villages have meant a 400 percent increase in tiger numbers from fewer than 20 to nearly 70			0
evidence of range state commitment to the strategy on the table at the summit is clear			0
more than half the $ 82 million that would be required for the effort each year is already committed by governments , international donors and non-governmental organizations			1
but there is still a $ 35 million annual shortfall , and this is all that stands between the tiger and its two possible futures : extinction or robust survival across @entity68			1
the hopes and risks could not be clearer at the @entity38 summit			0
@entity44 and other world leaders can leave a great legacy			0
in our collective role as stewards of our planet , we can not fail			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 and the @entity48 .			1

@entity163 of @entity48 says tiger population has *plummeted*
a summit in @entity39 with conservationists , nation leaders could set tiger 's fate , he says
*society* has proposed an $ 82 million plan at summit to stop decline , boost recovery , he says
@entity163 : plan still short of financial target ; leaders must not fail as stewards of planet
