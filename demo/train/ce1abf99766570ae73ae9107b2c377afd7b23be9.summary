@entity0 , @entity1 -- authorities stopped draining a lake here on thursday as authorities awaited @entity8 divers and sonar probes to help find two young cousins missing for nearly a week			1
about half the water in 25 - acre @entity14 had been pumped out by thursday afternoon , three days after drainage operations began , city officials said			1
an @entity8 dive team was en route to @entity0 and would employ two types of sonar in the search , bureau spokeswoman @entity15 said			1

my daughter is familiar with swimming in lakes , so i do n't think she would be scared of this lake , but they do n't come here and swim here , " she said			2

" and @entity21 's grandmother , @entity41 , said she does n't believe that the girls intended to go swimming			1
" i do n't think they would have even known the way to @entity14 , " she told @entity83 's @entity82 on tuesday			1
@entity30 said she 'd be " more comfortable " with the theory that the girls might have been abducted " once they drain the lake and we find nothing there			2
" " if you 've taken our kids , " she said on national tv , " bring them back			0
" missing girl 's grandma : ' we will fight ' authorities said tuesday that they did n't know whether the girls had been at the lake			1

the family has been questioned and polygraphed and had information taken from their cell phones , a process @entity30 said is hard but necessary			0
" we know that it 's a necessary measure they have to take to get as much information as they can and of course rule us out , so we did what we have to do , " she said			2
@entity123 : dogs searching for @entity1 girls stopped at edge of lake questioning has taken @entity30 and other family members away from the lake , which is hard , she said			2
" not that being out here might make a difference , but in your heart you want to be close to where they were last seen , " she said			0
when @entity0 mayor @entity139 heard that two little girls were missing in his town , he said , the first thing he did was to make sure every city asset that was needed was made available to the county sheriff			0
the next thing he did was take to the air , taking off in his twin - engine plane and flew over his town , looking for any sign of @entity149 and @entity22			0
" it just makes you sick , " said @entity139 , who knows both families			0
family ' bracing for the worst but hoping for the best ' in this town , neighbors know exactly how many people live there -- 4,751 -- and the small community in northeast @entity1 has never suffered through anything like the worrying going on now , the mayor said			0
the search remains a missing persons case , authorities said			0
no evidence has been found to suggest this is a crime , @entity139 said , but it is a mystery that has the whole community looking for two of their own			0
