@entity0 , @entity1 -- the alleys and archways along @entity5 in central @entity0 were plunged in darkness this weekend , as the @entity1 capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity			1
after sunset , the only light in one corner cafe came from two candles			0
their flickering glow barely lit the faces of men seated at a handful of tables , where they were breaking their @entity20 fast			0
nearby , residents trudged down the center of empty streets enveloped in darkness			2
some men played music from parked cars			0
others sat silently in doorways , their presence only marked by the glow of a cigarette butt			0

my father 's neighborhood has n't had electricity for five straight days , " said one @entity1 man who asked not to be named , for fear of attracting the ire of government authorities			1

" the @entity0 power cuts are caused by @entity61 and rebel attacks on power stations , " announced a television presenter on thursday			1
frustration could be felt at a recent government press conference , when a @entity1 man repeatedly pressed deputy foreign minister @entity67 on why some @entity0 neighborhoods had power while others suffered black - outs for days			1
" surely a large country like @entity1 does n't depend on one power station , " the @entity1 man said			1

shortages of gas have been a fact of daily life for months now , with drivers waiting days in line at gas stations for fuel			0
" one liter of petrol , 4 dinars ! " a taxi driver yelled on saturday , as he thumped a plastic jug full of fuel sitting in the back passenger seat of his car			0

@entity67 denounced the capture of the ship and its cargo of tens of thousands of tons of gasoline , calling it an act of international piracy			0

" at a time like this people want air - conditioning , " said 26 - year old @entity191 , who runs a children 's clothing store			0
@entity191 said the power outages began within the last two weeks			0
" @entity196 willing it will be fixed , if @entity61 would stop and leave us alone to resolve our problems , " @entity191 added			2
at a nearby fruit and vegetable bazaar , some passersby yelled @entity204 chants and vowed to stand strong against rebel and @entity61 attacks			1

but , as is often the case in public places , other @entity1 discreetly approached @entity2 reporters to whisper messages of dissent against the @entity55 regime			2
