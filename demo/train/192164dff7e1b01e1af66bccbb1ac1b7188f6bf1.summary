a @entity9 girl cries as she walks with her mother near @entity13 on friday			2
it is unclear who was responsible for the deaths in the village of @entity18 or how many of the victims were civilians			2
but if some of the victims are found to be non-combatants , their deaths could be handled by a war crimes tribunal , said @entity26 , @entity4 mission spokesman in @entity28			1
" some were combatants , and some were not , " he said			0
" if it is determined that they were not just caught in the crossfire -- that they were pulled out of their homes or singled out for questioning and killed -- that would make it a war crime			2
" @entity26 made the remarks one day after leaders at a regional summit called for an immediate cease - fire and the creation of humanitarian corridors in areas plagued by bloody attacks			1
fighting broke out at the end of august between the @entity9 army and rebel forces led by gen. @entity52			1

" he said friday that the recent violence , which the @entity4 estimates has displaced 252,000 people , must be prevented from spilling into the wider region			2
" neither the @entity9 nor @entity90 nor the rest of the @entity93 region can afford to be dragged back into conflict			2
the international community can not allow this to occur , " @entity95 told the leaders			0
" for far too long , peace and security in your region has been threatened by armed groups , domestic and foreign , present on the soil of the @entity9			2

" as leaders of @entity93 , you have a historic responsibility			0
this is a critical moment for the @entity132 and for @entity93 as a whole			0
we must put the cycle of violence behind us , " he said			0
" we must build a shared future of stability , peace , development and human rights for all citizens of your countries			0
