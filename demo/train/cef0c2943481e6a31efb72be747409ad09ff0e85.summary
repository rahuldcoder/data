@entity1 officials want to talk to @entity3			1
but can they get in touch with the militant group ? and if they do , can they do anything to save the lives of two @entity1 men being held hostage ? time is running out : @entity3 put out a video tuesday giving the @entity1 government 72 hours to pay $ 200 million , or else @entity15 and @entity16 -- like other @entity3 captives before them -- will be killed			1
@entity1 chief cabinet secretary @entity18 said wednesday that his government estimates the deadline will come at 2:50 p.m. friday , @entity22 time ( 12:50 a.m. et )			1
until then , he said , @entity1 officials are trying to save them			1
@entity18 said his government will do its utmost to communicate with @entity3 on the fate of @entity15 and @entity26 through a third party , such as another nation 's government or a local tribe			1
he did n't say whether @entity1 would be willing to pay any ransom			1
absent such a private back - and - forth , the @entity1 official voiced his government 's stance publicly , including its defense of a proposed aid package , also tabbed at $ 200 million , to help those who are " contending " with @entity3 , according to prime minister @entity38			1
@entity38 has defended the aid package as needed to build up " human capacities , infrastructure and so on , " yet @entity3 denounced it anyway in its recent video			1
" @entity1 's measures are absolutely not intending to kill @entity44 people , unlike what the hostage takers claim , " @entity18 said wednesday			1
" we strongly urge them not to harm the two @entity1 nationals and immediately release them			1
" @entity50 : harsh realities of ransom , kidnappings @entity15 and @entity26 were last seen months ago , disappearing in the same part of the world			2
while they had different professions , the two knew and talked to each other , said @entity26 's friend @entity59			2
it was january 2014 when @entity59 met @entity26 , who told him about his dream of providing security for @entity1 ships in dangerous areas , such as waters off @entity66 sometimes plagued by pirates			1
three months later , @entity26 headed off to @entity68 to gain combat and survival experience , @entity59 said			0
there , @entity26 met the man @entity3 refers to as @entity73 ( who goes by @entity15 on @entity74 and in a photograph accredited to him )			1
@entity15 is a freelance journalist who has worked for various @entity1 news organizations , including reporting about the northern @entity68 battleground city of @entity78 , which for weeks has been under siege by @entity3 , and other areas			1
@entity15 gave @entity16 insights on how to survive there , @entity59 said			0
he also introduced him to rebel fighters -- distinct from @entity3 , even though both were fighting against @entity68 president @entity86 's forces -- some of whom talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the injured			1
that plea spurred @entity26 to start raising money for this cause after returning to @entity1 , according to his friend @entity59			1
" i felt a chill when he said , after returning home , ( that ) he felt in @entity68 he was really living a life , " @entity59 said			0
" he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals			0
" he went back to @entity68 in july -- a trip that @entity59 said he did n't know about at the time			2
@entity59 said he had advised @entity16 to focus on building up his @entity104 , which provided armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in @entity108 and @entity68			0
@entity26 , 42 , went missing and was captured sometime after that			0
@entity15 met the same fate			0
while it 's not known exactly when he became a hostage , his last @entity74 post was on october 23			0
@entity114 worked as a fixer for @entity116			0
speaking to @entity2 in @entity117 , he said the journalist had reached out to him about going into @entity3 - controlled territory			1
" i am not @entity120 , i am not @entity121			0
i can go , " @entity15 told the fixer			0
fixers help reporters travel and connect with local contacts			0
@entity114 refused , believing the trip was too dangerous			0
another fixer agreed to take @entity116 to @entity3 , @entity114 said			1
before he left , @entity15 made a short video -- which @entity2 saw -- in which he explained his decision to travel was his , and his alone			2
@entity15 gave @entity114 his phones , and a list of numbers			0
" he gave me this and asked me to call @entity1 wife , his wife in @entity1 , his friends in @entity1			1
after one week , if i do n't hear any news of them or any connection , i have to call them , " said @entity114 , who remembers seeing @entity15 for the last time on october 25			2
after a week , he said , he had n't heard from @entity141 and so he made the call to his wife			2
@entity114 , who described @entity15 as his brother , praised his reporting work			0
" he is the best journalist i met him , and i work with him because he ( does n't ) like military stories			2
he covered , every time , civilian and kids stories in @entity68			0
" and also he is very strong			0
anytime he want to do his job very well ... sometimes we are going to danger ( ous ) places , he ( is n't ) afraid			2
he tell ( s ) me : ' this is my job			0
i have to do that			0
' " @entity2 could not immediately confirm the details of what @entity114 said			0
what happens next for both men is up to @entity3			1
unfortunately , it does n't have a record of showing much mercy			2
the @entity163 militant group has been behind mass killings and kidnappings during its years - long campaign to take over vast swaths of @entity108 and @entity68 , attempting to justify its actions -- like enslaving and having sex with young girls -- as somehow consistent with its extreme , conservative faith			0
taking hostages from outside countries has been part of its playbook			2
not only has @entity3 beheaded many of them , but it 's made a show of it by recording their deaths and showing them online as propaganda , something that began in august with the killing of @entity120 journalist @entity185			1
those beheaded hostages were @entity120 and @entity121 , both from countries involved in a military campaign against @entity3			1
@entity1 is allies with both , though it is not participating in any airstrikes or the training or outfitting of those fighting the militant group			1
@entity22 's stance on the conflict , including the $ 200 million pledge that @entity38 made sunday , was apparently enough to draw the ire of the group that calls itself the @entity198			1
" although you are more than 8,500 kilometers away from the @entity198 , you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade , " said the masked man who stood over @entity15 and @entity26 in tuesday 's video , addressing his comments to @entity38			1
who is ' @entity206 ' ? @entity38 has responded by defending the proposed aid and blasting @entity3 ' threat against two of his nation 's citizens as " unacceptable			2
" " i feel angry about it , " he said tuesday			0
" i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them			2
" @entity2 's @entity215 reported from @entity22 , and @entity2 's @entity216 wrote this report from @entity218			0
@entity2 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0

he does n't say whether @entity1 would pay a $ 200 million ransom demanded for release
