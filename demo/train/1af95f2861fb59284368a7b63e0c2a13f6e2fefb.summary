-- the @entity1 in central @entity2 looks like almost any another main traffic artery in the world these days			1
it 's four lanes in each direction , and high rise buildings with nondescript shops on the ground floors line the sidewalks			2
but this used to be one of the main streets of communist @entity2 , where the @entity17 regime showcased its arsenal during military parades			1
it was also the place i spent five years of my childhood from the late 1970s			0
my father , @entity23 , was the bureau chief for @entity26 @entity25 television in @entity2 , and with that title he became one of the people the intelligence service -- the @entity31 or " @entity31 " -- hated and spied on the most			1
their code name for him was " @entity34			0
" " it was a war of the airwaves much more than it was a war with weapons , because there was always this competition between @entity17 and @entity25 , " my dad recently told me when we visited our old house at @entity1 66			1
" they broke into our flat , but also into our office , " he said , describing the @entity31 's methods			1
and sometimes they wanted to show me that they were in			0
that i got the impression that i am being observed			0
" they tried to gather any sort of information they could on my dad			0
the @entity31 also used directional microphones and , of course , many informants who tried to make contact with our family and those working for the @entity26 office in the @entity64 in @entity2			1
the files that the @entity31 gathered were later made available to the public			1
when my dad went through his , he was amazed			0
" it was a total observation , " he said			0
" they wanted to know everything to try and determine what kind of guy i was , because they thought all @entity76 reporters were spies			1
" he later discovered that all of our neighbors around the house we lived in were secretly reporting to the @entity31			1
there were some situations where it was pretty obvious that people were acting as informants , or " @entity86 " as the @entity31 called them			1
but it was impossible for @entity76 journalists to know the full extent to which they were being shadowed			1
the daily work was a cat and mouse game			0
the east @entity17 regime went to great lengths to try and prevent people in the @entity17 ( @entity17 's official name ) from watching @entity76 tv			1
and they also did everything they could to stop @entity17 from talking to @entity25 reporters			1
" they wanted to stop our contacts with the @entity17 population , " my dad said			1
" that was their nightmare -- that there could be an alliance of @entity25 correspondents with the people of @entity17			1
" one such encounter was recorded in 1979 when my dad and his crew drove out to the @entity2 - @entity117 district to try to interview the author and activist @entity118 -- a man who was not afraid to speak out and criticize the regime			1
when the team arrived , @entity31 agents were already waiting , and they tried to stop them from talking to @entity118			2
the crew did what almost every tv crew does when confronted with government goons who want to stop them from doing their work : they started a long conversation while the cameraman secretly kept filming , and the @entity31 people grew increasingly uncomfortable as the situation went on			1
in the end my dad was allowed inside to speak to @entity118 , but the camera had to stay out			0
he would go on to interview the activist on many occasions , and they remained friends until @entity118 died			0
as time went on , the @entity17 government 's restrictions grew tighter and tighter			1
" they wanted a permission letter for everything , " my dad told me			0
" i could not even go up to you and just ask you what the weather is like			0
" one way to undermine the repression was to mislead the @entity31			2
in some cases the @entity26 crews would say they wanted to do feature reports about the beauty of the landscapes and towns of @entity17 , when in reality they wanted to show the mood of the people there			1
sometimes they would purposely talk about going to a certain area , knowing the spies were listening , and then go somewhere completely different			0
being a @entity25 family living in @entity2 , we were allowed to pass through the @entity170 to @entity172 anytime			1
the children actually went through the @entity174 every morning to get to school and kindergarten			0
my parents have never forgiven us for purposely losing our identification cards whenever we did n't feel like going to school			0
that meant we were stuck in the @entity2 , and that my dad would have to fly to @entity25 to get new ids for us			1
the constant harassing and spying also made life extremely difficult for my mother , who was doing an amazing job trying to raise me , my brothers @entity186 and @entity188 and my sister @entity189			2
my dad had promised her a glamorous life as the wife of a foreign correspondent with stints in @entity194 or @entity195			0
instead she found herself first in @entity196 from 1970 till 1977 , and then in @entity2			2
" she always had problems with the border guards , " my dad said			0
" and she was not ready to talk to them with a smile because she hated their questions			0
" one of the dumbest things the guards always wanted was to see was my mom 's left ear			2
it was in their protocol that people passing the checkpoints had to show their left ear to be positively identified			2
" first of all , she always refused to get out of the car , " my dad said			0
" and at some point she told them , ' listen , you have seen my left ear so many times , you must know what it looks like by now			0
i am not going to show you again			0
' " it did n't help that my siblings and i did a lot to bring our parents into embarrassing situations			0
my father remembered how he once got a call because his children had stolen a border guard 's hat and thrown it around the inside of a bus			2
on another occasion we threw balloons filled with water from the 13th floor of our building and hit an @entity17 " @entity241 , " as the regular police were called			2
" one of the questions that was asked in the police report was whether the balloons were filled with warm or cold water , " my dad recalled with a smile on his face as we stood outside the apartment building			0
i was 13 when the @entity170 came down			2
it meant nothing to me at the time			0
but today when i walk the streets of @entity17 's capital it is truly amazing to see how far the city and the country have come -- first rebuilding it after the shame of the @entity259 and @entity260 , and then re-unifying it after the long division of the @entity263			1
i take great pride in the fact that my dad played such a prominent role opposing @entity17 division , and that he and my mother never gave up and always stood tall and strong			2
no matter how repressive , intrusive and abusive the @entity17 regime was , it never broke the will of @entity34 .			1

as a child , @entity0 's @entity273 lived in @entity2 under the watchful eye of the @entity31
his father @entity277 , a journalist at a @entity25 tv *network* , says the @entity31 broke into the family flat
@entity277 : @entity31 's nightmare was " an alliance of @entity76 journalists with the @entity17 people "
@entity273 : it 's amazing how far @entity17 capital has come since the @entity170 came down
