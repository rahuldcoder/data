it 's a glaring number in a national poll that 's making headlines			0
president @entity4 's approval rating dropped 8 percentage points over the past month to 45 % , the president 's lowest rating in more than 18 months , according to a @entity10 / @entity9 survey released on monday			1
and @entity4 's disapproval rating soared 9 points to 54 % since mid-may			1
@entity10 poll : @entity4 approval falls as controversies pile up even more surprising : the overall decline in his approval rating was partially fueled by a plunge in support from younger @entity21 , a huge base of @entity4 's support			1
last month , nearly two - thirds of those in the 18 - 29 age group gave the president a thumbs up			1
his approval rating among that bracket fell 17 points in monday 's poll and now stands at 48 %			1
the @entity10 / @entity9 survey was conducted last tuesday through thursday			1
it comes as the @entity35 has been dealing with controversies over a government surveillance program ; @entity38 targeting of tea party and other conservative groups ; continuing fallout over the deadly terror attack on the diplomatic compound in @entity44 , @entity45 ; and the @entity47 's secret collection of journalists phone records as part of a government investigation into classified leaks			1
lawmaker says details on @entity56 - thwarted plots coming so what 's behind the dramatic shift of younger @entity21 , who along with nonwhite voters had been the most loyal part of the @entity4 coalition ? " one explanation may be that younger @entity21 are more likely to feel they are personally affected by the surveillance programs , " said @entity10 polling director @entity62			1
" more than half of all senior citizens , for example , think that the government has not collected their personal information , and since older @entity21 are less likely to use the @entity70 , they may be right			0
among younger @entity21 , two - thirds believe that the federal government has gathered their personal data			2
" @entity74 , a @entity75 professor and @entity10 contributor , said the shift is n't all about scandals but goes deeper			1
@entity79 tries to keep focus on @entity38 targeting scandal " part of it is probably that for younger people , the surveillance story is not a scandal but a sign the promise of 2008 was not fulfilled -- they see this and say he did n't do what he said he was going to do , " @entity74 said			2
" part of this is a frustration in the gridlock in @entity97			0
it 's not just the scandals but the sense that nothing is going to get done			0
( @entity4 ) has n't been able to change @entity97 in that way			1
instead of dealing with immigration or jobs , we 're dealing with @entity38 and surveillance , " he said			2
" people in that age group are also struggling with jobs , " @entity74 added			0
" that 's a constituency is easy to disappoint			0
" see more of the poll @entity62 said that shows up in the " honest and trustworthy " category			0
" today , there are only minor differences between older and younger @entity21 on that measure , but a month ago , two - thirds of younger @entity21 considered @entity4 honest -- at least 10 points higher than any other age category			1
so maybe one reason why @entity4 fell so far with younger @entity21 is that he had farther to fall , " he said			1
so has @entity4 lost the under - 30 crowd ? @entity124 , chairman of @entity126 's political science department , said probably not , but he could			2
" i suspect the things that favor the @entity128 will trump this in the long run , " @entity124 said			0
" the youth wants to see more tolerance and more inclusion			0
while the youth has been favoring the @entity128 in the past few years , neither ( party ) should see the partisan leanings of this group as set			2
" @entity74 agreed that it 's too soon to look at the plunge for bigger implications			0
" democrats should see this as their warning -- they do n't have to read this as a long - range trend , " he said			0
" this immigration bill is still there , that 's his chance			0
it 's not just about rhetoric and ideas but actual policy and change			0
" @entity155 claims online @entity4 expanded ' abusive ' security			2

@entity4 approval rating drops 8 percentage points over the past month
lowest rating in more than 18 months , according to a @entity10 / @entity9 survey
drop fueled partly by a plunge in support from younger americans
@entity4 has been dealing with controversies while priorities stall , job *market* *sluggish*
