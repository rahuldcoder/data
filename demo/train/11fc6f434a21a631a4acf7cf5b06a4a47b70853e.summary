-- in an age when people are encouraged to collect hundreds of @entity4 " friends " and thousands of @entity6 followers , some social media users , particularly young ones , are going smaller			1
yes , @entity4 and @entity6 remain the juggernauts of social sharing -- facebook with more than 1.2 billion active users and @entity6 with more than 240 million of its own			1
but over the past couple of years , it 's been smaller social sharing and messaging tools , most of them mobile apps , that have gotten the most buzz and gained the most users			1
these services encourage users to target personalized messages to individuals or small groups instead of broadcasting posts to larger networks of people			1
that does n't mean folks are ditching @entity4 for the silly photos of @entity30 or the 6 - second videos of @entity32			1
but these emerging social hangouts increasingly are where young users are communicating with each other			2
" i think it is too early to say that they 're abandoning the larger social networks , but certainly the audience for those networks is now fragmented , " said @entity37 , a journalism professor at the @entity38 who focuses on digital media and culture			1
according to a @entity49 survey from last fall , the two fastest - growing apps used by teens were @entity32 , which lets users share brief video clips , and @entity53 , a @entity54 mobile text and voice messaging app. usage of @entity53 had increased a whopping 1,021 % from the beginning of 2013			1
among those same teens , 56 % said they were active on @entity4 , compared to 76 % at the beginning of the year			1
" we did see a decrease in daily users , partly among younger teens , " @entity4 chief financial officer @entity59 acknowledged during an earnings call at the end of last year			1
that 's no surprise , according to @entity37			0
" first , young people are always looking for the coolest new thing , and now that their parents and grandparents are on @entity4 , it 's certainly not a cool new thing , " she said			2
" some of it is social currency , in general			0
" second , younger people have truly embraced the move to apps that are a combination of visual , mobile and social			2
they carry phones that are set up to shoot photos and videos and they are quite conditioned -- perhaps by their early years on @entity4 -- to sharing experiences in a way that previous generations might not be			2
" as opposed to a single new destination , alternate social usage has spread to a host of tools			0
in 2013 , @entity30 , @entity92 and @entity32 were all downloaded from @entity94 's app store more frequently than @entity6 or @entity4			1
@entity95 , the messaging tool that @entity4 bought for $ 19 billion last month , has more than 450 million users worldwide			1
and @entity92 , a photo - sharing network that feels more intimate than @entity4 ( despite being bought by @entity4 ) , now has more than 150 million users			1
the most recent buzz coming out of @entity103 is small , anonymous social apps like @entity101			2
those apps combine the joys of scandalous water - cooler gossip with the @entity108 's ability to keep us anonymous while we do it			0
you 're still posting to your established social networks , but nobody knows which friend said what			2
that speaks to one reason some observers see a move to smaller social networks			1
putting one 's best foot forward -- particularly in a way that will please @entity125 , your co-workers , your drinking buddies and your high school pals all at once -- gets hard after a while			0
last year , the @entity131 conducted focus groups with teens who said they had become less excited about @entity4 , " disliking the increasing adult presence , people sharing excessively , and stressful ' drama			1
' " the report noted , though , that few of them had stopped using the site altogether			0
in fact , those with the largest networks on @entity4 ( more than 600 friends ) were also the most likely to retreat at times to other , smaller social media			1
path , launched by former facebooker @entity146 in 2010 , limits users to no more than 150 friends			2
( it was originally just 50			0
) the app has n't fully lived up to the hype it received when it rolled out , and its growth has been hampered , in part , by privacy snafus early in its existence			0
but it has continued to chug along and now has more than 25 million registered users			0
( the company has not given out more detailed information , including the number of those users who are active			0
) @entity164 's theory for the app was based on research by @entity168 psychologist and anthropologist @entity167			0
@entity167 opined that our brains only have the ability to maintain 150 stable relationships			0
anything above that , and the relationship becomes more superficial			0
" some social media sites have become so large that , ironically , the social component is now lacking , " said @entity177 , a @entity178 telecommunications professor who studies the role of social media in news and politics			1
" one can not maintain relationships with more than a couple of dozens of friends , online or offline			0
" for many , sites like @entity4 and @entity6 have become " personal broadcast tools " that allow them to inform big groups about events in their lives , but not really share much , he said			1
" smaller social media spaces , especially specific to an area of interest or a skill , can become an alternative , where users can create a manageable social network , where they can invest in interpersonal relationships , " said @entity177 , who teaches a course in social media analytics			1
some people have reported fatigue from the effort required to maintain their social presences on big sites			2
" @entity6 and @entity4 ... are like giant auditoriums where we put on ' public performances			2
' and those have grown exhausting , " @entity214 , co-founder of @entity215 , a privacy app , told @entity0			0
" that 's why @entity30 felt so refreshing			2
" @entity30 lets users exchange photo - based messages that disappear after a few seconds , easing the pressure some feel to compose posts that will be widely liked and shared			1
that 's a topic author and marketing consultant @entity223 was tackling back in 2011 , around the time the " small social " surge was starting			0
in a piece titled " @entity230 , pretend friend and the lie of @entity233 , " he quoted social media buzz phrases like " social media makes a big world smaller " and " @entity237 is for people you know , @entity4 is for people you used to know , @entity6 is for people you want to know			1
" " all of these chestnuts are passed around like a flu strain because they make intuitive sense , " @entity223 wrote			0
" but common among them is the underlying premise that interacting with more people is inherently better than interacting with fewer people			0
i have always believed this to be true , and in fact have delivered the lines above in presentations and on this blog			0
but today , i 'm no longer convinced			0

in the @entity4 age , many users are turning to smaller social media
apps like @entity30 , @entity32 and @entity95 have seen huge growth
*scholars* say larger networks grow too big for our brains to handle
survey : teens with most @entity4 friends most likely to use a smaller network
