-- @entity1 was a prolific and versatile actor during his 68 years , but he 's best known to several as @entity2 a classically trained thespian , @entity1 filled the role of the tough but caring head of the @entity7 ' household on the ' 90s sitcom " @entity9 " for six years			1
along the way , he crafted a character that stands apart as one of the greatest fictional dads on tv			1
his costar @entity15 , who portrayed the family butler @entity16 , had it right when he said that @entity1 " strove to present an @entity2 that everybody wishes was their uncle			1
" as a result , his death this week has left a lot of fans feeling as though they 've lost a family member			2
every " @entity27 " fan probably has his or her own reasons why @entity2 was at the heart of the memorable comedy			1
here are our top five : 1			0
he was there for you in a jam			0
in case you missed " @entity27 " during its run from 1990 to 1996 , or somehow have escaped the endless repeats on basic cable in the years since , here 's a recap of the premise : now - famous blockbuster actor @entity44 portrayed a mischievous @entity46 teen who was sent to live with his rich relatives in @entity48			2
cue the culture clash as free - spirited @entity44 had to adjust to his @entity2 's rigorous rules			1
most of the humor came from that dynamic , but when @entity44 -- and , often , @entity2 's son @entity54 ( @entity53 ) -- really needed him , he did n't hesitate to help them out			1
that was established clearly with an episode in season one , when @entity2 came to @entity44 's rescue at a pool hall after the kid lost money and a car to a hustler			1
underneath his grizzly exterior was a sensitive role model			0
although @entity2 and @entity44 had their fights , the lawyer and eventual judge became a father figure for @entity44 's character			1
this was shown in one heartbreaking season four episode , when @entity44 's biological father re-enters the picture only to leave his son once again			2
a distraught @entity44 turned to his uncle , who readily embraced him			0
no matter how many times we watch this , we always get misty			0
he was not a man to be trifled with			0
every so often we saw glimpses of @entity2 's soft side , but it was his stern parenting style that always left us in stitches			2
take , for example , the way he handled one of @entity54 and @entity44 's failed schemes in season two : or how he completely shut down this guy 's attempt to smoke in an elevator ... and then took his phone : and how could we forget his confrontation at a police station in season one ? 4			0
he had a go - to move for kicking people out of his house			0
whenever you saw @entity44 's real - life friend and recording partner @entity109 on - screen in " @entity9 , " you knew he was n't going to be around for long			1
the running gag on the sitcom was that @entity109 's character , @entity114 , was always getting thrown out of @entity2 's mansion			1
it happened so often it became a patented move			0
he could bust a move when he wanted to			0
@entity2 was constantly getting ribbed by his family -- and especially will -- about his weight , but the regal patriarch was n't without a sense of humor			2
@entity44 brought it out of him with this classic dance scene from season five .			0
