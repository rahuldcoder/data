-- without question , the most valuable thing i 've ever just found was probably a stray $ 20 bill			1
people do n't randomly misplace their @entity9 © eggs in the parking lot of a @entity11			0
it 's classy up in that joint			1
that said , i 'd like to think that perhaps one day i 'll accidentally trip over some insanely valuable hidden treasure in my own backyard that poked through the earth after a heavy summer rain			1
but the sad truth is that if i stumble past anything out there , it 's likely going to be a cartoonishly large pile of dog poop			1
to date , my @entity29 has n't eaten any @entity31 stock			0
thus , until that glorious moment occurs , it seems my best bet for getting rich quick is to simply wander the beaches of @entity37 , @entity38 , and hope that i happen upon a huge chunk of whale puke			1
you see , a popular trending story this week was about an 8 - year - old @entity45 schoolboy who found a 600 - gram mass of it in the sand that seems to be worth about Â £ 40,000			1
for those of you keeping score in @entity53 , that 's 1.3 real pounds of hardened hurl valued at $ 63,000			2
by comparison , a decent @entity54 starts at half that and probably was n't yakked up by a sperm whale coming home from an all - night bender			1
" dude , i was a complete mess			0
@entity60 kept pouring shots down my blowhole			0
" so why , then , is a giant glob of whale barf worth more than a luxury car ? well , according to the @entity67 , what the boy found is actually called ambergris , and it 's a highly sought - after fixative to prolong the scent of perfume			1
" pardon me , i could n't help but notice you smell like whale spew			2
is that @entity76 ? " these days , manufacturers mostly use synthetics			0
clearly , the real stuff is hard to find , and the whales just do n't party like they used to			2
( @entity82 , deep sea crime statistics show ' ludes are making a comeback			0
) still , there 's high demand for actual ambergris , and young @entity88 is holding on to the mother lode			2
even more amazing is the fact that his golden glob of whale heave may have been floating around the sea for decades			2
after all those years , it literally could 've landed anywhere , but it landed right at his very feet			0
it 's just like the old saying : sometimes , you do n't find the whale vomit ; the whale vomit finds you			1
i think that was @entity104			0
so , now the lucky boy has to figure out what to do with his newfound treasure			0
as if selling it is n't the one and only option			0
however , his dad , @entity110 , says that at the moment , they 're just waiting for more information from marine biologists			0
while i appreciate their shared interest in science , i really ca n't stress this enough : sell it now ! @entity120 's whale throw - up ! look , i 'm all for learning , but if you happen to be holding a projectile from the belly of another living thing and somebody wants to give you money for it , you do n't ask questions			1
the conversation should be rather straightforward : " yes			0
" fortunately , the boy does plan to eventually make a profit from his discovery , and he could n't be sweeter about how he wants to spend it : he 'd like to build a house for animals			1
@entity82 , the article did n't specify whether the word " house " refers to some large sprawling ranch or , perhaps , an @entity144 where gorillas and bears and whatever else can run around humping and fighting and breaking things			2
think @entity149 meets " @entity150			1
" " please do not feed the @entity151			0
" anyway , if you plan to go out searching for whale retch , be prepared to have a bad time			2
and besides , there 's plenty of other good stuff from the ocean floor washing up on the beach			1
apparently ' ludes are making a comeback .			0
