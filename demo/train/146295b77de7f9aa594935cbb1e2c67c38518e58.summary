-- gov. @entity1 got himself into a bit of a pickle monday when he was quoted saying that he liked to " fire people			1
" many have jumped onto this line as evidence of the candidate 's callousness toward working people in a bad economy			2
even his @entity13 primary competitors latched onto the comment , especially as it might relate to his work at @entity17 , to show that @entity1 is in the business of making people unemployed			1
there 's much more smoke here than fire , but some of it , unfortunately , is @entity1 's fault			1
he was the one , after all , who tried to pitch his time at @entity17 as evidence of his success as a " job creator			1
" specifically , in the @entity13 candidates ' debate on saturday he said , " in the business i had , we invested in over 100 different businesses and net - net , taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added , those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs			0
" turns out this is n't entirely correct			2
when pressed , his campaign released figures that showed that a number of companies helped by @entity17 under @entity1 's tenure , such as @entity47 , the @entity48 , and @entity49 's , have added more than 100,000 jobs since then			1
but there are two problems with that figure			0
the first is that it 's the number of jobs in all the time since @entity1 started at @entity17 , including many years after he left			1
the second is that there are no figures that show how many jobs were added or lost at other companies @entity17 managed , so a claim of a " net " addition is unproven			1
@entity17 could release comprehensive figures , but it 's not likely it will			1
@entity17 is n't running for office , and i 'm sure it considers the information proprietary			1
the larger issue , though , is that many people were fired through @entity72 's work			2
that is what often happens when venture firms take over businesses through leveraged buyouts			0
these stories make for compelling campaign commercials and news pieces			0
they do n't paint @entity1 in as nice a light			1
that 's compounded when he claims to " enjoy " firing people			1
but let 's be fair			0
the governor is having his words taken out of context			2
here 's the full quote : " i want individuals to have their own insurance			0
that means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep people healthy			0
it also means if you do n't like what they do , you can fire them			2
i like being able to fire people who provide services to me			2
if someone does n't give me the good service i need , i 'm going to go get somebody else to provide that service to me			0
" @entity1 is n't talking about his time at @entity17			1
he 's talking about health insurance			0
specifically , he 's talking about how he 'd like insurance to work			0
he would rather everyone be personally responsible for buying insurance , instead of getting it from the government			0
then , he says , if the insurance company did a bad job , people could fire them			1
that sounds much better , right ? unfortunately , it 's not			0
the first problem is that @entity1 ascribes motives to the insurance companies that make no sense			2
if you would just leave the insurance company if it did a bad job , then there is no incentive for it to keep you healthy			0
healthy people are cheap for insurance companies , and sick people are not			1
if you go from being healthy to being sick , it 's in an insurance company 's best interest that you leave			0
that 's an economic fact , not a moral judgment			0
it 's only if you ca n't leave , if you have to remain on their books no matter what , that the company has an incentive to keep you healthy			0
the second problem is worse , though			0
healthy people often do n't know their insurance plans are bad until they get sick			1
healthy people , after all , do n't make as much use of their plans			2
once they fall ill , though , it means now they have a pre-existing condition , which will make it almost impossible to them to get a new plan if they decide to fire their old insurance company			0
the way the private insurance market works today , almost no one has the luxury of firing the insurance company once he or she figures out it is n't doing a good job			1
that 's not true in @entity163 , of course			2
thanks to @entity1 's legislation there , insurance companies ca n't deny you coverage and also ca n't charge you more for being sick			1
there , thanks to @entity1 , you can fire your insurance company and be assured of finding a better one			1
it will also be true for many more people once president @entity177 's @entity176 gets fully under way in 2014			0
since @entity1 seems so enamored of firing bad insurance companies , you might think he 'd want to protect and promote other people 's ability to do so			1
instead , he opposes the @entity176 , which would do the same thing nationally that his law did for the people of @entity163			1

@entity191 : @entity1 comment on firing people is mostly out of context ; smoke , not fire
but it calls attention to his *questionable* record as " job creator " at @entity17 , he says
his quote involved firing health insurers ; but sick people do n't have luxury of doing that
@entity191 : in @entity163 they can , under @entity1 health law ; yet he opposes national *reform*
