a 19 - year - old in oil - rich @entity7 , he did what many activists in the @entity10 world were doing : he got online , posting a call on @entity13 for a " @entity14 " against the authoritarian government of the former @entity17 republic			1

he 's due to get out in august 2013			0
@entity1 is one of at least 17 @entity37 considered " prisoners of conscience " by @entity20 , which released a damning report wednesday accusing the country of suppressing dissent and the press			1
self - censorship has increased and criticism of the state " is punished in all sectors of society , " @entity20 's @entity7 researcher @entity44 said in the capital , @entity51 , on wednesday			1
the " report shows lengths that the government goes to to silence " opponents , she said			2
the " government has criminalized peaceful protests by banning them " and " defamation of the government continues to be criminal offense , " she said			0
the government of president @entity64 -- whose father , a one - time member of the @entity66 , was president before him -- uses techniques described as despotic in other parts of the world , said a top @entity20 official			1
" @entity7 has achieved the bones but not the meat of a democracy -- opposition are allowed to exist but not to function , " said @entity72 , the deputy director of the agency 's @entity74 and @entity75 program			2

" an opposition journalist who served four years in prison also spoke at the press conference			0
@entity89 , founder and editor - in - chief of @entity7 and @entity91 newspapers , was sentenced to eight years and six months in jail in 2007 , but @entity20 helped him win his freedom earlier this year , he told the press conference			1

things that have been achieved here and done so far should be mentioned , " he argued			0

@entity7 is strategically important because of pipelines that bring oil and gas from the @entity140 and @entity75 to the @entity141 via @entity142			1
@entity20 insisted that the international community is more interested in @entity7 's oil and gas sectors than in a democratic government that supports human rights			1

@entity7 *clamped* down on dissent inspired by the @entity14 , @entity20 says
it accuses the oil - rich @entity159 republic of holding at least 17 prisoners of conscience
@entity7 rejects the report as *unfair*
the @entity140 country has strategically important oil and gas pipelines
