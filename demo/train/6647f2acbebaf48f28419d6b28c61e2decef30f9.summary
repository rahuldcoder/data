-- breakfast , beer breaks and goat 's - milk ice cream : the ultimate two - day tasting itinerary in @entity7 's largest city			1
savor the flavors of @entity9 in between visits to the city 's landmarks			1
day 1 : @entity13 ( the @entity14 ) breakfast on a street lined with carpet shops near the @entity18 , @entity19 ( breakfast for two $ 20 ) , whose owners hail from @entity7 's eastern @entity23 area , serves up the region 's puffy breads , herb - flecked otlu cheese , and addictive tahini spread			1
eggs baked with spicy soujuk sausage might seem like overkill , but order them anyway			2
mid-morning fix it would be a crime to miss the @entity35 mosque , an @entity37 masterpiece ; it would be sadder still not to visit the nearby @entity39 ( boza for two $ 4 )			1
decked out in weathered marble , this vintage cubbyhole specializes in boza -- a cross between pudding and a beverage , which is made from fermented bulgur			1
traditionally it 's consumed with leblebi , nutty roasted chickpeas			2
lunch @entity52 after haggling for kilims at the @entity54 ? it 's worth tracking down @entity56 ( lunch for two $ 30 ) , a macho kebab dive colonized by gaggles of mustached vendors			2
order lahmacun -- wafer - thin lamb - slathered pizza -- with @entity64 ( an epic charcoal - grilled lamb patty ) and a vegetable salad dressed with pomegranate molasses			2
washing your meal down with ayran , a tart yogurt drink , is a sure way to pass for a local			2
@entity74 unwind with a frosty glass of @entity76 on the rooftop terrace of @entity78 ( drinks for two $ 10 ) , which feels like it is suspended between the @entity80 and @entity81 against the backdrop of the @entity83			1
dinner though certain @entity89 swear that fish should be eaten at the water 's edge , the suave , smart - suited businessmen and bejeweled matrons who patronize @entity87 ( dinner for two $ 65 ) know better			0
a waiter appears as soon as you settle in your seat , carrying a tray of meze , small plates meant to be sampled with raki , @entity7 's signature anise liquor			0
order platters of smoky eggplant salad and buttery lakerda ( cured bonito ) -- then choose grilled levrek ( sea bass ) , moist and perfectly cooked			0
@entity0 : @entity108 's top late - night restaurants day 2 : other neighborhoods breakfast even if contemporary @entity7 art is n't your cup of çay , visit @entity115 ( breakfast for two $ 45 ) , a museum in a renovated warehouse , for its stylish café and waterfront terrace			1
with luck , giant cruise ships wo n't obstruct the postcard - perfect view of the @entity125 as you tuck into a breakfast of simit ( sesame bread rings ) , creamy beyaz peynir ( feta ) , crunchy cucumbers , and sour - cherry jam			1
@entity132 farther along the @entity134 road , stop in the village of @entity136 for a stroll through craft shops and the @entity140 mosque			0
at @entity141 ( ice cream for two $ 2 ) , sample the goat 's - milk ice cream , which is thickened with the powdered root of wild orchids			0
splurge on a triple scoop of pistachio , pomegranate , and black mulberry			0
lunch continue on to @entity152 , a 19th - century mansion in @entity154 that houses an impressive collection of @entity37 paintings			0
espousing a different aesthetic , the museum 's @entity159 restaurant ( lunch for two $ 98 ) is noted for its neo- 60s interior of unpolished oak and black - leather banquettes			0
try the olive oil - braised celery root enlivened with tangerine , and rosy lamb chops , from the smart modern - mediterranean menu			0
drinks time your visit to @entity172 ( drinks for two $ 16 ) with the sunset -- and the evening call to prayer			1
that 's when young locals file in for cocktails , like fresh - ginger - and - muddled - lime mojitos , and jockey for steel stools on the open - air terrace overlooking the city 's two coastlines and the @entity134 strait in between			1
dinner @entity188 is known for its raucous drinking houses , or meyhane , where meze are an excuse for rivers of raki			0
the insiders ' favorite is @entity197 ( dinner for two $ 50 ) , a brick - walled dining room illuminated by chandeliers that sets the scene for house specials like ficin , a spiced meat pie			0
the best part ? watching beau monders stomp their heels to the @entity7 band 's beat			0
wait , is that your wife tossing banknotes at the dashing oud player ? planning a beach getaway ? do n't miss @entity0 's guide to @entity216			1

do n't miss boza , a cross between bulgur pudding and a beverage
unwind with a glass of @entity76 on the rooftop terrace of @entity78
