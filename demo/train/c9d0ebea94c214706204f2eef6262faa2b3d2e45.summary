-- there may not be a single cemetery in @entity3 or in the entire country that is willing to be @entity6 's final resting place , a funeral director told @entity0 on monday			1
and that has left @entity9 in a very difficult spot			1
" i think ( the cemeteries that have been asked ) probably fear reprisals from people who have loved ones being buried there , people who may potentially buy lots there , " the funeral director said			0
@entity6 and his younger brother , @entity19 , are accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the @entity21 in april			1
the funeral director says he is trying to do everything he can , but he 's struggling			1
" i think a lot of the people do n't understand , " @entity9 said			1
" and it 's an emotional problem , obviously			2
" but , " we have to bury this guy , " he continued			0
" whoever he is , in this country , we bury people			0
" but outside the funeral home in @entity34 , about 40 miles west of downtown @entity35 , picketers denounced plans to bury the marathon bomb suspect in their community			2
one held a sign that read , " @entity41 the garbage in the landfill			0
" bomb suspect 's friend out on bail , released to mom @entity48 , chairman of a @entity34 civic group , told @entity0 that @entity9 " made a big mistake " agreeing to accept the remains , " and now we 're in a situation where nobody wants to take him			1
" " i not only do n't want to see him buried in @entity34 , @entity3 , very close to where i live , i do n't think he should be buried in the state , " @entity48 said			1
he said his organization , the @entity58 , is trying to raise up to $ 5,000 to have @entity6 's body shipped overseas			1
" he 's not a citizen , he should n't be given rights , " @entity48 said			1
meanwhile on monday , a law enforcement official who spoke to @entity0 said that investigators believe that @entity6 accessed @entity67 magazine -- an @entity66 published by @entity68 -- on a computer in the apartment where he and his wife lived			1
the @entity67 material had instructions on bomb - making , the official said			1
asked whether the computer belonged to the husband , his wife , or whether it was shared , the official said only that investigators believe the husband was accessing that material			2
what are the options ? it may be possible to look to the past for guidance on how to handle the remains of notorious figures			0
five new things in @entity35 bombing story president @entity91 's assassin , @entity90 , is buried in the @entity93 area , where he lived before shooting @entity91 in 1963			2
@entity96 bomber @entity95 's ashes were scattered after his execution , though where is a mystery			2
the body of @entity102 's killer , @entity101 , lies in an unmarked grave in a @entity105 cemetery where other members of his family are buried			1
cremation is not an option because @entity111 does not allow it , according to @entity112 of the @entity113			0
however , it would not violate @entity113 tradition to bury @entity6 in an unmarked grave , which may reduce the odds that a cemetery would suffer a backlash for providing space			1
in fact , it 's customary for @entity124 to forgo gravestones , according to @entity126 , a professor of international affairs and @entity113 studies at @entity129			2
" that burial could be carried out by simply saying he was buried in a cemetery and burying him without a marker , " @entity130 said			0
some might ask why there has n't been a move to bury @entity6 at sea , the way @entity136 was buried			1
first , @entity136 's body was in the possession of the federal government , which is n't the case with @entity6 's body			1
secondly , as @entity112 points out , it was n't a concern that relatives of @entity136 should be consulted			0
the @entity148 asked @entity149 if officials objected to burying @entity136 at sea			0
a family matter in @entity6 's case , his parents are alive and in the @entity157 region of @entity158			1
but @entity6 held a passport from the former @entity161 republic of @entity162 , where he was born , so his remains ca n't be sent to @entity157 , said @entity164 , a lawyer for the parents			1
@entity6 had requested a @entity157 passport but had not received one , @entity164 said			2
his parents have not asked that his body be brought to @entity157 -- and in any event , @entity157 law says the bodies of " terrorists " killed by government forces should be buried in an undisclosed location , without the family being notified of the site , he said			0
@entity130 said that although an unmarked grave may not violate @entity113 practices , it could certainly run afoul of the courtesy of getting @entity6 's parents ' permission to conduct their son 's burial that way			1
on monday afternoon at a media event , @entity3 gov. @entity186 stressed that the fate of @entity6 's body rests with his family			1
" first of all , this is n't a state or a federal issue			0
it 's the family 's issue , " the governor said , responding to a reporter 's question			0
" and the family has some options			0
i assume they will make a decision soon			0
i think everybody is feeling upset about what happened			0
" a reporter asked : " do communities have a right to refuse the body ? " " i do n't know about right , " @entity186 answered			2
" i think , if you 're asking about legal rights and so forth , i do n't know the answer to that			0
but i understand that the family does have some options , and i expect they will make a decision soon			0
" asked if he opposed burying @entity6 in @entity3 , @entity186 said , " i do n't have a comment about that or a point of view			1
" watch : @entity222 does n't want body either on sunday , @entity6 's uncle @entity224 was the only relative at @entity9 's funeral home			1
@entity224 , who decried the bombing suspects as " losers " after the attacks , performed the @entity113 tradition of preparing a body for burial , washing and shrouding it			2
he said he had not been in contact with @entity234 , his nephew 's widow			0
" i 'm left alone to deal with this matter , " @entity224 said			0
" and i want to stress that @entity6 has no other place to be buried			2
there 's no other place who would accept his body			2
" @entity243 clash @entity6 's uncle wants him buried in @entity243 , @entity3 , arguing that it 's his nephew 's home			1
" he grew up here , " @entity224 said			0
but town officials have strongly rejected the idea			0
" the difficult and stressful efforts of the citizens of the @entity243 to return to a peaceful life would be adversely impacted by the turmoil , protests , and widespread media presence at such an interment , " city manager @entity250 said in a statement sunday			1
@entity9 suggested monday that he and the family are considering appealing to a @entity124 cemetery outside @entity3			1
and yet , that might not work either , he fears			0
" i feel the same problem exists when the neighbors and the people find out what we 're doing , " @entity9 said			1
he added that most of the cemeteries in @entity3 are nonsectarian with a section set aside for @entity124			2
" the only true @entity124 cemetery is in @entity271 , " he said , without naming the cemetery he was referring to			0
" at this point , any outcome would be better than nothing , " @entity9 said			2
and he will continue to try to bring this painful experience -- for everyone -- to an end			0
@entity9 has said that if no grave site is found , he plans to ask the @entity148 government to find one			1
" this is a big problem , and somebody has to step in and say , ' look , we 're going to have to do something here , ' " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 contributed to this report .			0
