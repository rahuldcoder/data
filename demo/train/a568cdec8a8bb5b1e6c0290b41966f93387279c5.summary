-- the sudden momentum toward a bipartisan plan to reform the @entity4 immigration system has sparked a torrent of discussion about this politically charged and emotional issue			1
here 's a sampling of voices from across the spectrum of viewpoints : " anything other than having these people going home and apply through our regular immigration system that successfully admits over 1 million people every year is amnesty , " said a @entity0 commenter using the screen name ninesixteen			1
" allowing them to wait in the @entity4 is a reward			2
our immigration is deliberately constructed to not let in unlimited numbers			1
these people violate our laws yet expect to be allowed to stay and work when others wait patiently in their countries			2
" @entity30 : @entity31 or path to citizenship ? " illegal immigration has already put massive and unaffordable burdens on the welfare state and with 20 million or more applying for @entity31 , this will simply accelerate this process , " said @entity34 founder @entity34 , who argues that the real number of undocumented immigrants in the @entity4 is higher than the frequently cited 11 million figure			1
@entity45 ' welcomes ' new @entity4 immigration reform push " i 'm a liberal democrat but here 's the problem with this law , " said a @entity0 commenter going by the screen name @entity48			1
" legalize them and now they have to pay taxes , @entity53 ( @entity52 ) , get minimum wages , union participation etc. now they are no longer economically employable by farmers , construction , landscapers and hotels , hotel workers , etc. so we are left with 11 million more on welfare while these companies search outside our border for more workers			2
no , i 'm totally against this , they 're illegal , arrest them and kick them out			2
secondly , it took me 20 years and about $ 40,000 to get my citizenship legally and i feel cheated when i see this			0
" by the numbers : immigration and naturalization " they need to make them do things the right way			1
spend the thousands of dollars to file that paperwork properly			0
make sure all the criteria is met			0
put them through the ringer like they do anyone else who applies for @entity91 in the @entity4 , " @entity0 comenter @entity85 said			0
" first fix the border			0
then make e-verify federal law , and enforced			0
after that is done , i will welcome the 11 million illegal immigrants , " @entity0 commenter " @entity97 " said			0
what 's in @entity101 immigration plan ? " what i am asking for is that president @entity103 consider every category of immigrant as he moves forward with immigration reform			1
i have to say , it irks me a bit when i hear that illegal immigrants will not be deported when i have waited for months and spent thousands of dollars to do it ' the right way , ' " said @entity107 , a @entity108 who married an @entity4 but said she was n't allowed back in the country after a visit home with the couple 's infant daughter			0
the couple has had to spend seven months apart , she said , while sorting through immigration issues			1
immigration plan : a new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity ? " it is vital that the framework includes a path to citizenship , so that undocumented immigrants can come out of the shadows and into the light and have a chance to become @entity4			1
it gives hope to millions of our fellow human beings , " archbishop @entity136 of @entity137 , chairman of the @entity139 ' @entity138			0
@entity140 : under deportation , above fear			0
