-- days after blocking a @entity4 - bound flotilla , @entity2 's government offered sunday to ship aid to the @entity7 territory -- a move applauded by the @entity10 chief but derided as insufficient by protest organizers and @entity7 authorities			1
@entity2 's foreign ministry released a statement sunday afternoon in which it proposed to " undertake the task of transporting the humanitarian aid , with @entity2 vessels or other appropriate means , through existing channels			1
" that same day , foreign minister @entity20 talked by phone with @entity10 @entity22 ban ki - moon			2
the @entity10 chief " thanked " the @entity2 official and " expressed support for the @entity2 initiative , " according to a statement from the @entity10			1
" in his view , it could help to reduce tensions in the region and ensure much - needed aid is delivered to those who need it in @entity4 , " the @entity10 statement said of @entity22 's views , adding the world body will " work closely with @entity2 , @entity33 and @entity7 authorities on this matter			1
" however , one @entity7 official , chief @entity7 negotiator @entity40 , said that funneling food , cement and other goods via other means , such as @entity2 ships , missed the point , which he said is to " immediately lift , not ease " @entity33 's maritime blockade of @entity4			1
he lauded those behind the flotilla as people " who have dedicated their time , effort and passion for a just cause			0
" " the situation in @entity4 is not about border crossings , " @entity40 said sunday in a statement			2
" it is about the illegally denied and internationally recognized rights of the @entity7 people to dignity , freedom and self - determination			2
" a spokeswoman for @entity66 , a @entity67 ship full of activists ( but no humanitarian aid ) that was barred last week by @entity2 authorities from sailing to @entity4 , said the @entity2 offer " does n't really address the issue for us , ( which is ) ending the naval blockade			1
" " it 's all very well and good that there are some channels ( for aid to @entity4 ) , " @entity76 said			1
" but that is not the same as lifting the siege of @entity4			2
" the vessel 's captain , @entity83 , remained in @entity2 custody on sunday , one day after being asked to report to a police station			2
a spokesperson with the @entity88 , who was not named per custom , said @entity83 , an @entity67 , was arrested because he left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger			0
he will appear before @entity2 prosecutors on tuesday			2
@entity95 , one of the flotilla organizers , called the arrest " intimidation " aimed at likewise preventing the other nine boats in the flotilla from setting sail to @entity4			2
on sunday , eight passengers from the @entity67 ship began a hunger strike outside the @entity105 in @entity106 , demanding their captain 's release and allowing the ship to set sail			0
the vessel -- which carried 36 @entity67 passengers , four crew members and several journalists , including @entity0 reporter @entity115 -- was intercepted last friday by a @entity2 @entity117 patrol vessel roughly 10 minutes after it had departed @entity118			1
after an hours - long standoff , the ship eventually returned to @entity2 , where it is tied up at a @entity2 naval facility			0
the @entity66 and the nine other ships are aiming to promote public awareness about @entity33 's blockade of @entity4 and , in part , to commemorate a may 2010 incident in which @entity33 troops boarded @entity129 , a @entity130 ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries			1
nine people died in subsequent clashes with @entity33 @entity137 commandos			0
@entity76 said that while the @entity67 ship 's crew are frustrated they have n't been able to head to @entity4 , there is some degree of satisfaction that their cause has drawn attention and provoked debate worldwide			1
" people went to @entity106 and still would like to complete the mission , " said @entity76 , who is in the @entity67 but is in close contact with her fellow activists in @entity2			1
" at the same time , the feeling is very good that important work is being done that is shedding more light on the situation , with the whole blockade			0
" the @entity2 government has said it wo n't allow any of the boats in the flotilla to sail to @entity4 because their mission is too dangerous			1
flotilla members accuse the @entity2 government of buckling to pressure from @entity33 's government			1
for their part , the @entity33 have said they are mounting a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail at all			0
on tuesday , the @entity33 government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill @entity33 military personnel should their boats be boarded			0
they said that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on @entity33 commandos			0
flotilla organizer @entity179 dismissed the allegations tuesday as ludicrous , saying : " they see this nonviolent , ragtag group of ships as such a threat they 're using their entire propaganda apparatus , and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists			0
" the @entity189 -- composed of officials from the @entity67 , @entity10 , @entity191 and @entity192 -- on saturday issued a joint statement asking " all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas , which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation			0
" the quartet added in its statement that it " strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of @entity4 to do so through established channels , so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings			0
" doing so , the group contends , is the best way to both help @entity7 and address @entity33 's " legitimate security concerns			2
" on sunday , @entity40 said that while @entity7 leaders " support international engagement in lifting the unjust and inhumane @entity33 blockade , " the quartet 's statement and their opposition to the planned flotilla to @entity4 skirt the broader challenges in the region			1
" we invite them to focus on resolving the root cause of the conflict , which is the occupation , rather than seeking ways to manage its destructive symptoms			0
" @entity40 said of the quartet			0
@entity0 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 chief @entity242 *welcomes* the offer , saying " it could help reduce tensions "
but a @entity7 leader says this wo n't address what it calls an unfair blockade
