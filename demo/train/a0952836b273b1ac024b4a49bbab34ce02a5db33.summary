tensions are running high following the massacre at the offices of @entity4 in @entity5 on wednesday , and that is exactly how it should be			2
the correct , human response to an atrocity of this nature is revulsion and deep moral anger			2
far from precluding rational understanding , such anger should cause us to demand sensible , productive analysis and to brush aside comments from politicians or pundits that do not live up to the seriousness of the moment			2
the " clash of civilizations " has become a popularized frame that is wheeled out whenever an attack by @entity26 extremists is carried out against a @entity28 target			1
it casts a democratic , liberal west as being locked in an epic struggle with a backward and violently intolerant @entity35 world			1
according to this narrative , the @entity36 , which treasures freedom of speech , has this week come under attack from an @entity26 culture that refuses to accept any instance of what it regards as blasphemy			1
voices from the left and right can be heard repeating the assumptions underlying these sweeping generalizations			1
consider two examples from the @entity51 this week			2
@entity52 , leader of the anti-immigrant party @entity53 , opined that there are people living in @entity51 from other cultures who " hate us " and represent a " fifth column , " thus implicating entire communities as enemies of the nation			2
separately , the liberal @entity51 journalist @entity62 tweeted : " @entity5 : brutal clash of civilizations : @entity66 's belief in freedom of expression vs those for whom death is a weapon in defending their beliefs			2
" snow of course knows very well that a handful of armed men do not constitute a " civilization , " just as he knows what the phrase he employed is universally understood to mean			0
with the far right on the march across @entity66 , and violent reprisals being carried out against blameless @entity86 muslims , now is not the time for inflammatory or even careless language			0
moreover , these two - dimensional representations do nothing to help us make sense of what is actually going on			1
ascribing characteristics to entire " civilizations " as though they are uncomplicated and homogenous , containing no competing or contradictory forces , is to tell ourselves a fairy tale rather than to face the world as it really is			0
take the idea that freedom of speech is a @entity28 value			1
clearly @entity66 and @entity102 enjoy a high degree of freedom of expression			0
but the elected governments of many western states also provide material support to some of the most repressive regimes in the world			0
in @entity112 friday , dissident blogger @entity111 was publicly flogged for the crime of facilitating debate and insulting @entity26			1
in states such as @entity118 and @entity119 , those expressing unacceptable opinions can find themselves jailed , tortured , and even massacred , while the governments of the @entity122 and @entity51 continue to arm the regimes responsible			0
@entity86 too is a major weapons dealer in the region , supplying states such as the @entity129 and @entity130 , the latter of which jailed the poet @entity131 for 15 years for " insulting the emir " and calling for the overthrow of the government			0
the support given to these tyrannies by @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity5 is not an aberration , but a core component of long - established strategy			1
if democracy and freedom of speech are inherently and uncomplicatedly " @entity28 values , " how does one account for this ? similarly , if democracy and freedom of speech are antithetical to the values of @entity150 or @entity35 culture , then how to explain the thousands , even millions of people in the @entity153 that have , especially since late 2010 , fought and risked their lives for precisely these things , often against regimes backed by @entity28 states ? are we to airbrush from the picture those participants in the @entity150 uprisings who are both @entity35 and defenders of human rights , ignoring their bravery and their sacrifices ? @entity167 has its champions and opponents in all parts of the world			1
the degree of freedom secured at any given moment merely reflects how the struggle between the two sides has played out so far , rather than some innate cultural attributes			0
the social systems of the @entity36 were not born democratic , but became that way through often painful periods of internal conflict , @entity86 being the classic example			0
likewise , the extreme puritanism of @entity184 and @entity185 has not emanated smoothly and naturally from the cultures and religious practices of the @entity153 ( where it continues to be overwhelmingly rejected )			0
in the modern era , it was originally imposed by force in the @entity192 when the @entity193 conquered the area in the early twentieth century			0
the @entity112 have since promoted fundamentalism , often as a way of suppressing more secular forms of opposition , and have lost control of the results with disastrous consequences			1
the roots of @entity26 extremism are complex			1
western state support for regimes like @entity112 , and pursuit of disastrous wars , not least in @entity204 , may not be the decisive causal factors			0
but they are part of the mix , and profoundly unhelpful			0
what we need now is not false division between " @entity216 " and " @entity36 " , but for democrats on both sides to stand together against extremism and violence in all its forms .			1

' @entity224 wheeled out when @entity26 extremists attack @entity28 target is sweeping generalization , @entity223 says
these two - dimensional representations do nothing to help us make sense of what is actually going on , wearing *writes*
what is needed is for @entity35 and @entity28 democrats to stand together against extremism and violence in all its forms , he says
