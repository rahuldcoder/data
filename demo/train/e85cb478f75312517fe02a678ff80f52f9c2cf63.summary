@entity0 -- the courtroom erupted in cheers after former @entity5 dictator @entity4 was found guilty of genocide in may 2013 for allegedly allowing massacres of more than 1,700 indigenous @entity8 in the early 1980s			1
hundreds dressed in traditional ethnic " huipiles , " crossed their arms over their chests in a sign of gratitude to the tribunal for being the first in the world to try a head of state for genocide in his own country 's judicial system			2
but the verdict would only stick for 10 days			1
@entity0 's @entity23 annulled the conviction and ordered a retrial in 2015 , a move critics considered politically motivated			2
as the one - year anniversary of the @entity4 trial nears , many -- including @entity28 officials -- are sounding the alarm over recent judicial moves they say threaten the country 's weak justice system			1
" for the proper functioning of democracies , independent and capable public servants are essential , " the @entity28 @entity36 in @entity0 said in a recent statement			0
" if judges are subject to threats and intimidation , justice will suffer			0
" such statements followed two controversial decisions			0
first , the nation 's highest court ruled in february that attorney general @entity49 , who was instrumental in bringing charges against @entity4 , must step down from her post in may , seven months before her term was to expire			1
the court 's ruling was based on a technical interpretation of @entity49 's term			0
the 47 - year - old prosecutor was appointed in 2010 after a prior selection process was scrapped due to alleged corruption			2
the court interpreted that hers was an interim mandate			0
then this month , the @entity62 suspended magistrate @entity63 , the presiding judge in @entity4 's trial			1
just weeks after the suspension was handed down , @entity63 was awarded an @entity66 by first lady @entity67 and the @entity68 , in part for her role in the genocide trial			2
@entity63 was sanctioned by the @entity62 after attorney @entity72 , part of @entity4 's legal team , accused her of an ethics violation for the way she expelled one of @entity4 's lawyers from the proceedings for contempt			1
both @entity63 and @entity49 were key to the short - lived conviction of the 87 - year - old retired general			1
" the dirty campaign started last year , " @entity84 , representative of the @entity85 in @entity0 , told @entity1 en @entity87 ol			2
" it 's been a series of attacks in the media , etc. by various conservative sectors			0
" there 's no conclusive evidence that the actions against @entity49 and @entity63 are retaliation for their role in prosecuting @entity0 's one - time dictator , but the sentiment among many is that this is exactly what happened			1
@entity0 's elite have long had a strong grip on power , and some experts say the elite feared that a decision against a stalwart of the old guard like @entity4 could have opened the door to further prosecutions of former leaders			1
longtime critics have also denounced organized crime gangs ' collusion with judges and courts			0
some experts say these two corrupt factions have too much influence over the judiciary			0
the trial unearthed @entity0 's complicated relationship with its own history as both protesters and supporters rallied outside the courtroom last year			2
@entity4 came to power in a march 1982 coup , only to be overthrown 18 months later			1
during the trial , prosecutors argued that @entity4 's junta government oversaw the bloodiest period of the country 's 1960 - 1996 civil war that left more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million refugees , according to various truth commission reports			1
leading figures , including president @entity140 , deny genocide took place in @entity0			2
on the same day that the verdict came down in the @entity4 trial , @entity140 predicted that it would not stick			1
" today 's ruling is not set in stone , " the president told @entity1 en @entity147 that night			0
" let 's just say it showed the good , the bad , and the ugly , " said @entity150 of the conviction and subsequent reversal			0
@entity49 's ousting and the sanction against @entity63 signal that the entire legal system is still at risk , said @entity150 , senior fellow at the @entity159 and political science professor at @entity161			0
@entity63 continues to stand by her verdict despite facing what she calls retaliation			1
" history can not be undone , " she said			0
but @entity166 , chief counsel for @entity4 , calls the initial trial a " farce , " and with several appeals in play , said it is possible that @entity4 might avoid a second trial			1
to date , the general 's defense team has lodged over 70 motions and appeals			2
the most controversial move was a ruling on one of those appeals that basically reverted the trial back to its initial phases , undoing the conviction			0
" perhaps the kernel of light in this whole process is that it was much , much harder for the elites than it would have been 10 years ago , " said @entity186 , program director at the @entity187 in @entity188 and longtime @entity0 expert			1
" they 've had to resort to outrageous forms of pressures and measures			0
" the @entity195 this week delivered the shortlist to the president of those favored to take the helm of the attorney general 's office , and @entity49 did not make the cut			1
" with @entity49 driven out and being few days from having a new attorney general , this reflects that various power groups continue to benefit from maintaining impunity , " said @entity202 , coordinator of the @entity204 watchdog @entity203			1
for others like anti-impunity commissioner @entity210 , the future of the judicial system is really a test about the strength of the country 's democracy			0
" after all , " he said , " it 's the proper functioning of the judicial system that gives @entity5 citizens faith in other structures within the state			0
" @entity0 has one of the highest murder rates in @entity226			0
the @entity228 nation of almost 15 million placed fifth deadliest in the @entity230 rankings this year			2
a recent @entity68 report stated that widespread institutional corruption continues to be a concern .			0

a year ago , @entity4 was found guilty of genocide
but the verdict was overturned within 10 days
the attorney general and judge in the case have had their jobs affected
some say it is in retaliation for prosecuting @entity4
