a couple of years ago , i asked civil rights leader and former ambassador to the @entity5 @entity4 to tell me something about dr. @entity7 that most people did not know			1
@entity4 thought for a moment about the more personal side of his mentor and confidant			0
he said that @entity7 liked eating catfish , was quite a jokester and enjoyed laughing with friends			2
among other things , @entity7 was an avid basketball player and a crafty passer with a great sense of the court			2
he could drive and shoot with both hands because he was ambidextrous			0
@entity4 's depiction of his mentor as a joking hoopster reminded me of an important factor we often overlook when considering @entity7 's civil rights legacy : he was very young when he changed the world			1
most people in their 20s struggle with dreams , doubts and career choices			0
in @entity7 's mid- 20s , he was pastoring a church , co-founding the @entity35 , leading the @entity36 and receiving countless death threats			1
by his 30s , @entity7 was leading the monumental march on @entity38 and winning the @entity39			2
clearly , @entity7 's youth was more of a catalyst than liability			1
in his cult classic book , " outliers , " @entity43 discussed how birth dates and timing were as crucial factors as talent and tenacity in forging the successful careers of athletes , business tycoons , technology innovators and other leaders			0
for example , @entity43 argued that had @entity58 been born just 10 years earlier , there would have been no @entity59			1
through a @entity62 perspective , then , if @entity7 had been born 10 years earlier , there might not have been a @entity64 bus boycott			1
an older @entity7 might have been far too entrenched in black @entity66 denominational politics or invested in clerical careerism to put everything on the line and lead a risky fringe boycott			2
his kids would have been older , his practical needs would have been greater and perhaps his judgments would have been more conservative , resembling the numerous middle - aged black baptist preachers who had opposed activist strategies in favor of a less confrontational approach toward gradual reform in the civil rights movement			1
similarly , young @entity7 's moral and spiritual discourse was the product of a malleable mind fresh out of graduate school , not the kind of predictable theorizing you would expect to see in an older preacher 's cultural toolkit			1
@entity91 synthesized @entity93 's treatise on civil disobedience , @entity96 's theological philosophy , @entity98 's @entity97 and the @entity100 's views of justice to form a personal vision and tactic that awakened the moral consciousness of the nation			2
it 's fortunate for us that @entity7 was not a middle - aged pastor when the moment in history demanded transformational leadership			1
he was just a young , fearless and somewhat naive pastor in @entity64 , @entity112			0
we can presume that the civil rights movement shaped @entity7 as much as he shaped the movement			1
with youth and inexperience on his side , young king had the improvisational space to carve out a movement philosophy and strategy that has been replicated many times over where people challenge oppressive governments			0
as we commemorate the birthday of our seminal civil rights leader , we should take some time out to remember that the same king who changed the course of history started out like you and me			1
he liked playing basketball and joking with friends			0
he was young and had fire in his heart			0
@entity7 's legacy should inspire our youth to step up and exert the visionary leadership that will help guide us through our era of change and uncertainties			1
tenured scholars , contentious politicians and fat - cat business executives are too cynical , comfortable and conservative to do anything			0
it 's up to our wide - eyed students			0
and they should remember that youth is not an impediment ; rather , it 's the seed that can bring forth a better future			0
just look at the young @entity7			2
join @entity153 on @entity154 and follow updates on @entity156			0
