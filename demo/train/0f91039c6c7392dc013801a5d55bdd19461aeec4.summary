@entity1 , @entity0 -- when @entity3 traveled to @entity4 to shoot his film about a man forced to flee @entity7 after falling foul of the @entity9 he did n't expect fiction to turn into reality			1
a still from " @entity12			1
" production of the film was halted after the crew were fired upon by suspected @entity9 militia			1
but that 's exactly what happened three weeks into shooting political thriller " @entity12 " in late 2008			1
gunmen attacked the first - time director and his crew near the @entity7 border			1
four @entity4 crew members were shot and wounded in the incident and the entire crew was forced to flee the region			1
@entity4 authorities later told @entity29 that the gunmen were affiliated with the @entity9 and were in fact targeting the @entity33 members of the team			1
" i was very upset			2
it was terrifying to know that somebody was trying to attack us , trying to shoot us , " @entity29 told @entity2			2
with the help of local security forces the team was immediately evacuated to @entity40 and put on a flight out of the country in 24 hours			2
@entity29 had only managed to film three - quarters of the script and the film 's future lay in the balance			1
" when i heard that the crew members who had been shot were going to be fine i started to think like the businessman and the producer , " says @entity29			1
" i thought , ' how are we going to finish this film ? we 're not just going to give up			1
' and to a man everybody involved agreed to finish it			2
" after six months spent organizing financial backing , the original cast and crew flew to @entity57 to complete the movie and has been attracting interest from distributors			1
despite the danger caused by shooting so close to the actual conflict zone , @entity29 says he would shoot in the region again if he had the chance			2
" every place you point a camera there 's a great shot			1
you do n't have to go very far to find fantastic authentic @entity7 architecture and beautiful landscapes			2
" all the people are in the same sort of authentic costumes , so you do n't have the problem of trying to find authenticity -- it 's all around you			0
" @entity29 hopes the authenticity will help " @entity12 " enjoy the same level of success as @entity83 's " the @entity82 " -- the first film about the @entity85 war to make a profit at the @entity88 box office			1
@entity83 's thriller tells the story of an elite army @entity92 bomb squad who battle insurgents and each other , as they disarm a innumerable roadside bombs on the streets of @entity98			0
@entity83 shot " the @entity82 " in @entity99 , as close as she could get to the actual conflict zone			1
she also made use of local actors			0
the film is based on screenwriter @entity105 's first - hand experiences gathered whilst embedded with a bomb unit in @entity85			1
" because it was based on real life , we wanted to keep it as realistic as possible and keep it accurate , " @entity83 told @entity2			0
" i mean this is a conflict that 's still on - going so we felt responsible to the troops still there and the situation on the ground			0
" the cast faced grueling shooting conditions : temperatures ranged between 115 and 120 degrees @entity117 ( 46 and 49 degrees @entity118 )			0
it was even hotter in the authentic bomb suit worn by @entity121 , who plays staff sergeant @entity122			0
the suit weighed 60 pounds			0
" you really ca n't explain the heat and the weight of the suit , " @entity121 told @entity2			0
" that certainly helped the realism of it all			0
there were a few moments i felt like ... i 've been as close as i could 've come to war without actually being in the military			2
" the heat was real , the dust was real , the costumes and everything was so real that the tension [ was already there ] , " @entity136 who plays sergeant @entity137 told @entity2			0
" @entity83 would come to us before every scene and say , ' remember at any moment you can die			0
' and we kept that in mind throughout all the scenes			0
" while " the @entity82 , " has made over $ 11 million in the @entity88 , previous movies dealing with conflicts in @entity85 and @entity7 have struggled to make money			1
observers have attributed this to " war fatigue " suffered by audiences due to an abundance of war - stories in the media			0
@entity83 and @entity29 are confident that cinema audiences have a thirst for knowledge about volatile regions like @entity85 and @entity7 that goes beyond what is reported on the news			0
" i think the conflict [ in @entity85 ] has been somewhat abstract for the general public , certainly speaking for myself , " @entity83 told @entity2			0
" the film provides kind of a window , a lens onto what this particular conflict might be like , and gives it some specificity			2
" @entity3 hopes " @entity12 " can have a similar effect			1
" @entity7 is at the moment quite central to global security			0
i think it 's good that people are looking at @entity7 , questioning it , asking all sorts of questions			0
if my film can play any part in that , any small part , then i 'm pleased			2

four @entity4 crew members shot during filming of " @entity12 "
despite *difficulties* , director @entity3 says it was a great film location
star of " the @entity82 " says filming was similar to being in the military
