@entity0 -- @entity3 's ruling party has extended its decades - long grip on power after one of the country 's most hotly contested parliamentary votes			1
prime minister @entity11 's @entity10 coalition has ruled @entity3 for 56 years			1
@entity11 , the son and nephew of former prime ministers , has been in office since 2009 and appears to have won a new mandate in sunday 's vote , according to results from @entity3 's electoral commission , which reported the coalition won 133 seats in parliament			1
@entity11 's leading challenger , @entity23 , and his @entity25 party -- which won 89 seats , according to the commission -- have not yet conceded the vote , however , alleging widespread vote - rigging before and during the election			1
turnout was high , with the election commission saying 80 % of eligible @entity3 have voted			1
the weeks leading up to sunday 's poll saw reports of firebombs , texted death threats and beatings			2
just days before polling booths opened , the potential for voter fraud was being alleged after reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off with water			0
" the whole purpose of introducing indelible ink is to cut off multiple voters -- that is now being compromised by low quality ink , " said @entity47 from @entity48 , which campaigns for electoral reform			0
" the election commissioner had the cheek to tell us they forgot to shake the bottle			1
how ridiculous can that be , right ? " in a bid to end the claims , @entity3 's election commissioner staged a public demonstration thursday to prove his assertion that the ink could not in fact be washed off			2
other allegations surfaced sunday , with @entity23 's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and brought in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of @entity10			1
the ruling coalition disputed the allegations and said the vote was free and fair			1
@entity23 , a former finance and deputy prime minister , served time in prison on corruption and sodomy charges which he says were politically motivated			1
the first sodomy charge was overturned in 2004 and in january 2012 he was acquitted of a second charge of sodomy , a serious offense in @entity3 which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison			2
ethnic tensions bubble beneath vote in a hard - fought campaign , both parties tried to entice voters with promises of generous government spending , though analysts say it 's ultimately a choice between old and new , the status quo and an untested opposition			1
" both manifestos actually do not contain anything policywise ; there are just little giveaways , they promise you this , promise you that but there 's not much policy difference between both of them , " said @entity101 , professor of political science at the @entity3 campus of @entity105 's @entity104			0
bubbling under the surface is racial tension that has divided the country ever since @entity10 introduced policies in the 1970s to favor ethnic malays			1
the country 's constitution effectively splits the country between @entity124 , or ethnic @entity120 , and natives of @entity126 and @entity127 , and citizens of mostly @entity130 or @entity131 descent			0
according to the @entity133 , just over 50 % of the country is @entity134 , while @entity130 make up 23.7 % and @entity131 7.1 %			2
there are set government quotas on how much of the country 's wealth should be held by @entity124			0
they are entitled to discounts on housing and must be offered enough stock in a company if it wants to be listed on the stock exchange			0
the policy has created discontent that the opposition harnessed in its campaign , saying the policies must be reformed to create a more open society			2
but one analyst said a @entity25 win would not mean wholesale change			0
" @entity23 and @entity25 are realistic enough to know that if they try to change the foundation of the state then the @entity120 wo n't vote for them			1
they will fine - tune the system so that the system reflects more on need rather than race , " @entity101 said			1
what 's important to voters , says @entity164 's @entity101 , is whether the election is perceived to be free and fair			2
" it 's not just the results , people are judging them on whether there is going to be any fair play , " she said			2
" if there is none , people will be very angry			0
i 'm not sure what the people will decide to do -- it is really up to the people to take charge			0
" a poll released by the @entity181 last week suggested that more than 60 % of voters surveyed favored @entity25			0
however , the government dismissed the poll and said its own survey showed it was out in front , according to local news websites			0
@entity101 of @entity104 said voters ' response to a potential @entity10 victory will depend on how many of the 222 federal seats it can win			1
" if @entity11 gets within the range of 140 to 150 ( seats ) people will just give him the benefit of the doubt			0
but if he goes above 180 they will be demonstrating in the streets			0
the population will not accept that he has a majority , " he said			0
from egg - throwing to bombs the rate and severity of election - related attacks escalated since parliament was dissolved on april 3			1
on thursday , @entity206 urged both coalition parties to " rein in their supporters , " who it said had graduated from egg - throwing and paint - smearing to physical assaults and bomb attacks			1
and along with the violence , the group said that cyberattacks had been directed at a number of @entity3 news websites , restricting access to reporting on the election within the country			2
" ensuring everyone can access information without interference is critical if there is to be a level political playing field in @entity3 , " said @entity222 from @entity206			0
" the government has a duty to investigate and shut down all cyberattacks , interference with @entity232 , and hacking so that freedom of expression and the right to receive information is preserved			0
" foreign investors were anxious about the election outcome because despite concerns about @entity3 's gaping fiscal deficit , the country 's economy has performed relatively well amid the global slowdown			2
the @entity245 expects @entity3 's gdp to grow 5 % this year , boosted by capital projects and domestic spending , as citizens make use of civil servant wage increases and government handouts .			0
