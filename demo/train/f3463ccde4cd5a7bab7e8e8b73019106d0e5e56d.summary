a late goal from @entity2 secured @entity4 all three points in dramatic fashion as it saw off @entity6 2 - 1 in the @entity8 opener at @entity9 monday			1
with the scores tied at 1 - 1 and the match running deep into stoppage time , @entity4 seemed as if it would miss out on a deserved victory after running @entity6 ragged for much of the 90 minutes			1
however , in what proved to be the last meaningful kick of the game , up stepped substitute @entity2 to round off an excellent @entity17 move and slot past @entity19 to settle the tie			2
@entity8 -- billed before the tournament as the " @entity22 " -- was wrapped up monday with @entity24 's 3 - 1 victory over @entity25			1
after its @entity26 exploits last summer , @entity24 is favorite to lift the trophy			0
the @entity24 reached the second round of the global tournament in @entity30 and took eventual winners @entity32 to extra time before bowing out			0
the squad is also the top - ranked side competing in @entity35 as they sit 18th in @entity37 's global ratings			0
@entity24 won its opening @entity8 tie with @entity25 3 - 1 but the score could have been very different if it had n't been for own goals and missed penalties from the " @entity25			1
" goals from @entity44 and @entity45 won the match for @entity24 along with @entity48 's own goal			0
@entity6 had come into its earlier match as favorite as it attempts to claim a first @entity52 title in 33 years , having reached the final four on the last four occasions , including a second - placed finish in 2010			2
former @entity56 and @entity57 boss @entity55 is the man charged with the task of ending the @entity6 ' drought , yet his first competitive clash as @entity6 coach has left him with much work lying ahead			0
@entity6 had to do without captain @entity63 as he continues to recover from a bout of malaria , but was able to call on brothers @entity66 and @entity68 -- and it was the younger sibling who opened the scoring in @entity35			0
the forward converted a well - taken penalty to net his fifth goal in his last six appearances for his country after @entity76 had been brought down in the area by @entity4 goalkeeper @entity78			2
without injured @entity79 forward @entity80 , @entity4 saw much of the ball throughout the first half but struggled to convert that possession into clear - cut chances , although @entity86 's header rattled the crossbar and @entity88 saw a superb bicycle kick saved			2
@entity91 's team , however , was rewarded for its pressure soon after the break with @entity88 -- who plays for @entity96 club @entity95 -- converting the rebound , after his original header had come back off the post , to level proceedings			0
four - time champion @entity6 look rattled and @entity4 seemed to determined to pounce , only for chance after chance to be tossed away -- @entity88 and @entity105 were guilty of wasting golden opportunities , while the @entity17 mustered 13 more attempts on goal than their opponent			1
with the referee moments away from blowing the final whistle , the @entity6 looked set to escape with a fortunate point , before @entity2 stepped up to send @entity4 and its supporters wild .			1

@entity4 picks up three points in @entity8 opener against @entity6
@entity88 equalizes for @entity4 before @entity2 scores late winner
