-- sure , you could get lucky like @entity2 , @entity3 , resident @entity4 , and find a winning @entity6 lottery ticket from the january 15 drawing on the floor of your dirty room and pocket a cool $ 1 million			1
and you 've probably daydreamed about winning the @entity6 lottery and retiring to someplace where they 've never even heard the words @entity14			1
after all , with an estimated $ 60 million on the line and no winner after wednesday 's drawing , those who hope to strike it rich are still lining up at convenience stores in the hopes of scoring the lucky ticket			1
but let 's get real : your chances of actually playing the right combination of numbers and striking it rich through the lottery are slim			0
how slim ? try one in 1 in 175,223,510			0
that means you have a greater chance of being killed by a shark , according to @entity32			1
those odds are 1 in 3,700,000			0
and , as long as we 're being morbid , you also have a 1 in 134,906 chance of being struck by lightning , say the folks over at the @entity39			2
on the up side , you also have a 1 in 88,000 shot of dating a supermodel			1
go ahead and hedge your bets , but you have a greater chance of winning your office 's @entity47 pool			2
of course , those odds depend on whether your office couch potato co-worker enters this year			0
and the @entity51 has much greater odds of winning olympic gold medals			2
go @entity54 ! but who knows ? you could get lucky like last week 's winner			0
the ticket , purchased at @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , netted some undisclosed winner the $ 425 million jackpot			1
the next drawing is saturday .			0

winning the @entity6 jackpot of $ 60 million is a long shot
being killed by a shark and dating a supermodel are better bets
but if you 're the *unknown* winner of the $ 425 million prize , odds do *n't* matter
