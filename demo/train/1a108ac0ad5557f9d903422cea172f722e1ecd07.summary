@entity0 they 're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police , have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority			2
a new intelligence assessment , circulated by the @entity8 this month and reviewed by @entity1 , focuses on the domestic terror threat from right - wing sovereign citizen extremists and comes as the @entity12 administration holds a @entity14 conference to focus efforts to fight violent extremism			1
some federal and local law enforcement groups view the domestic terror threat from sovereign citizen groups as equal to -- and in some cases greater than -- the threat from foreign @entity24 terror groups , such as @entity25 , that garner more public attention.â € ‹ the @entity8 report , produced in coordination with the @entity30 , counts 24 violent sovereign citizen - related attacks across the @entity33 since 2010			1
@entity25 burned up to 40 people alive in @entity36 , official says the government says these are extremists who believe that they can ignore laws and that their individual rights are under attack in routine daily instances such as a traffic stop or being required to obey a court order			0
they 've lashed out against authority in incidents such as one in 2012 , in which a father and son were accused of engaging in a shootout with police in @entity54 , in a confrontation that began with an officer pulling them over for a traffic violation			0
two officers were killed and several others wounded in the confrontation			0
the men were sovereign citizen extremists who claimed police had no authority over them			1
among the findings from the @entity8 intelligence assessment : " ( @entity72 citizen ) violence during 2015 will occur most frequently during routine law enforcement encounters at a suspect 's home , during enforcement stops and at government offices			1
" the report adds that " law enforcement officers will remain the primary target of ( sovereign citizen ) violence over the next year due to their role in physically enforcing laws and regulations			1
" the @entity14 has fended off criticism in recent days for its reluctance to say the words " @entity86 extremism , " even as the conference this week almost entirely focused on helping imams and community groups to counteract the lure of groups like @entity25			0
absent from the @entity14 conference is any focus on the domestic terror threat posed by sovereign citizens , militias and other anti-government terrorists that have carried out multiple attacks in recent years			1
an administration official says the @entity14 is focused on the threat from all terrorists , including from sovereign citizen and other domestic groups			1
" i do n't think it 's fair to say the ( @entity14 ) conference did n't address this at all , " the official said , adding that president @entity12 addressed the need to combat " violent ideologies " of all types			0
an official at the @entity113 , which is leading the administration 's counter-radicalization effort , says many of the tactics aimed at thwarting radical @entity24 recruitment of young people can also be used to fight anti-government extremist groups			2
while groups like @entity25 and @entity122 garner the most attention , for many local cops , the danger is closer to home			0
a survey last year of state and local law enforcement officers listed sovereign citizen terrorists , ahead of foreign @entity24 , and domestic militia groups as the top domestic terror threat			1
the survey was part of a study produced by the @entity135 's @entity134 for the @entity136			0
in 2013 , a man who held anti-government views carried out a shooting attack on three @entity141 employees at @entity142 , killing one @entity141 officer			0
last year , a couple killed two police officers and a bystander at a @entity149 @entity148 store			0
@entity150 , senior fellow at the @entity151 , said that by some estimates , there are as many as 300,000 people involved in some way with sovereign citizen extremism			1
perhaps 100,000 people form a core of the movement , he said			0
the federal government 's focus on the domestic groups waxes and wanes , @entity150 said , in part because the threat from foreign groups like @entity122 and its affiliates			2
@entity150 says sovereign citizen groups have attracted support because of poor economic conditions			1
some groups travel the country pitching their ideology as a way to help homeowners escape foreclosure or get out of debt , by simply ignoring the courts and bankruptcy law			2
the @entity8 report 's focus on right - wing terrorists is a subject that garnered political controversy for the @entity12 administration in the past			2
in 2009 , a @entity8 report on possible recruitment of military veterans by right - wing militia groups prompted an outcry from veterans groups			1
the report was produced by staff members during the @entity195 administration but was n't published until then @entity8 @entity196 had taken office			0
@entity198 criticized her own agency for the report .			0
