-- @entity1 has joined an illustrious list of athletes who have won 5,000 meter and 10,000 meter olympic gold medals by beating off a late challenge to win the shorter distance race in front of a roaring home crowd			2
the 29 year - old runner stepped up the pace 600 meters from the end , but then faced an impressive chase down from @entity15 @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16 in the home strait			0
but he held on to cross the line in 13 minutes 41.66 seconds			1
" i 'm just amazed - two gold medals , who would have thought that ? i got a lot of support from a fantastic crowd and that helped me towards the end " @entity28 told @entity29 after the race			2
his wife is set to give birth to twins anytime soon and he dedicated both victories to them , saying " they can have one each "			1
as is typical in his races , the pace set at the start of the race was fairly slow , with @entity41 athlete @entity40 leading with a lap time of 1 min 11 seconds			0
the @entity15 duo of @entity14 and @entity44 then lengthened their strides to pick up the pace , but encouragement came from @entity28 's @entity41 training partner @entity49 who helped keep @entity28 in contention by meeting the @entity15 's pace			0
@entity49 could not stay with the pack on the final lap and @entity28 was left to fight his way into the lead and try to hold on , despite tiring heavily in the last couple of meters			1
the victory comes a week after he took the 10,000m title and the crowd responded to his achievement by chanting his name as he went on a lap of honor which was more pedestrian in pace only because of the number of people that wanted to congratulate him			0
he is the first @entity68 athlete to win both races at the games and only five other men have managed to do the double , @entity73 @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity75 from @entity76 and @entity15 @entity77 and @entity78			2

he lives close to the @entity84 in @entity85 , but he moved out to the @entity41 last year to enhance his preparations for these games by training with @entity49 .			0
