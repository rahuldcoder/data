-- it is hard for me to recall a victory as total -- or surrender as ignominious -- as the @entity5 of 2013			1
room @entity8 of the @entity10 , the office of senate minority leader @entity7 , is where the final deal was struck , and it will join @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity15 as the site of an unconditional surrender			2
they ought to put up a plaque where @entity21 majority leader @entity20 delivered the tea partying @entity23 their worst whipping in a generation			1
i 'm not sure i have fully absorbed all we have been through these past two weeks in @entity27			0
the 15 - day shutdown saw a deadly shooting at the @entity10 , a self - immolation on the @entity31 , a citizen waving the @entity34 battle flag in front of the @entity36 and @entity37 veterans storming one last barricade			2
no one could have predicted all of that			0
but the outcome itself was a foregone conclusion			0
republicans were seeking an unattainable goal : repealing @entity48 during the presidency of @entity50			1
they were sure to fail			2
but the circumstances of their defeat -- and the @entity56 hero who has emerged -- are worth noting			1
faithful readers of my columns in this space will recall that i predicted the president would prevail in the government shutdown because his party is more united , more mainstream and more reasonable			1
and , while our president undoubtedly triumphed -- showing a steely resolve that critics thought he lacked -- the undisputed heavyweight champion of the shutdown showdown is @entity20			1
he truly is the @entity70			0
while the @entity36 @entity23 conference exploded like the finale of a fireworks show , @entity20 held together a @entity74 that is significantly more diverse			1
from @entity76 sen. @entity75 , a socialist , to @entity79 's @entity78 -- who is so conservative that he shot a rifle at an environmental bill in one of his ads -- @entity20 kept his forces united			1
calling @entity20 an ex-boxer is like calling @entity86 an ex-naval officer ; you really never depart from those deeply ingrained traits			1
in the gym at @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity20 learned to box			1
he learned how to explore your opponent 's defenses , how to probe with a jab , when to feint and when to cover up			0
and when you have your opponent on the ropes , you finish him off			0
unlike the solitary sport of boxing , politics is a team effort , and @entity20 led his team with brilliance and bravery			1
@entity20 , @entity36 minority leader @entity107 and @entity50 are three very different kinds of leaders			1
and yet they were yoked together in perfect balance ; one would lean in while another held back ; one would hold an olive branch while a third would talk tough			0
the poor republicans were divided between the realists , who were depressed , and the true believers , who were delusional			2
@entity118 sen. @entity117 would strut and admire his plumage , while @entity36 speaker @entity120 alternated between feckless and hapless			2
in the end it was @entity125 who performed last rites on the corpse of @entity48			0
to be sure , no victory is ever final			0
no defeat is ever permanent			0
republicans went on to hold the @entity36 after their disastrous shutdown of 1995 - 96 , and @entity50 rebounded from what he called " a shellacking " in the midterm elections of 2010 to win re-election comfortably in 2012			1
he has been a student of politics and a creature of @entity140 since he worked his way through law school as a @entity10 police officer			0
you wo n't see him dancing around the ring , holding his championship belt over his head			0
perhaps he 'll have a quiet dinner with his beloved @entity149			0
then begin training for his next fight			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2
