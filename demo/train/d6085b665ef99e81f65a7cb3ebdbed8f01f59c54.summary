-- my childhood home - four - bedroom colonial in a @entity5 , suburb - had an exquisite exterior			1
but inside there was too much furniture crowding every room ; too many @entity10 receipts spilling from end tables with too many drawers ; too many televisions , with their confusing array of remotes , making too much noise ; too many boxes of yellow cake mix aging in the overstuffed pantry ; too many shoes and coats crammed into the hall closet , making it impossible to find the ones i needed in a hurry			1
do n't get me wrong : ours was never one of those unsanitary houses you see on hoarding shows			1
it was just uncomfortably full , like a belly straining against a belt while its owner made room for one more pie and seven more mini-muffins			1
the problem was my mother , who had trouble parting with anything she thought someone she loved might someday need from her ( in other words , anything )			1
my father vacillated between resister and accomplice			1
in my more enlightened moments , i imagine that if i had grown up as they did , in a poor village in @entity49 , i , too , might have held on a little too tightly once fortune finally favored me			1
but as a child , i felt as though i were drowning			1
i remember coming home from school to find things in my closet - wrapping paper , extra blankets - that did n't belong there			1
in protest , i 'd toss these intruders into the hall			1
then as now , clutter had a physical effect on me			1
the sight of knickknacks caused my left shoulder to rise and fall , tic - like , as if trying to shake something off			1
@entity0 : break your bad habits for good since leaving home for college , i 've been making up for lost space			1
the home i currently share with my two sons looks from the outside like the one i grew up in - gorgeous redbrick , huge yard - but inside , there are no walk - in closets			1
and gloriously , no garage			1
there are no coffee tables , because with them comes coffee - table clutter			1
no televisions , because their sidekicks are remote controls and piles of dvds			1
if a decorator walked through my home , she 'd recommend an ottoman here and there , a decorative accessory for the hallway , or end tables to cradle the telephones that sit on the hardwood floor in front of the jacks			1
she 'd suggest art for my untouched walls			1
she might wonder why there 's no dining table in the dining room			1
it 's not that i dislike decorations ; i truly admire beautifully appointed homes			1
my laundry room holds tightly taped boxes full of mementos from my travels			1
i just ca n't figure out how to put them up without turning into a woman who has animal statues flanking her front door			2
i fear that if i start , my dna strands - with their broken @entity123 gene - might eventually strangle me , leaving me writhing in a pile of throw pillows			1
surely children of alcoholics are just as careful about taking that first drink			2
@entity0 : what @entity129 knows for sure about finding the fullest expression of yourself though my home is empty of the extraneous , it never feels empty enough			2
i frequently walk around with a cardboard box hunting for donation targets			2
for me , de-cluttering is an itch that pleads , then demands , to be scratched			1
if something 's not being used this very moment , or on the cusp of being used , it 's out			2
there 's no ill - fitting clothing in my home , save the two onesies i held on to from my sons ' baby days - and one small box of prepregnancy pants that keep me jogging			1
i purge my closet seasonally , tossing anything that is n't earning its keep			2
what have you done for me lately , red sweater ? when they 've sat unused too long , mocking me , i 've evicted my hair dryer , curling iron , patio furniture , any coffee mug with words on it , and my broiler pan			2
i understand that most ovens come with a broiler pan			2
what i do n't understand is , why ? why do n't we get a choice in the matter ? i have no baking pans , either			2
in an emergency , tinfoil is quite foldable and durable			2
i adore items with multiple uses , especially paper towels			2
in my house , these magic little squares moonlight as dinner napkins , place mats , sponges , dishrags , sometimes toilet paper , and , occasionally , ambitiously , maxipads			2
but even paper towels i can not stand to stock up on			2
since i discovered @entity187 's @entity186 service , they arrive on my doorstep monthly , in a perfectly synchronized dance of use and replacement			2
one thing i 've been unable to get rid of is the outdoor garbage can that my home 's previous residents left behind			2
do you know how hard it is to throw away a trash can ? i 've tried cute notes with smiley faces ; i 've stuck the can inside my own , but the garbage collectors refuse to take the thing			2
it grates on me daily to see that green monstrosity leaning against my house			0
sometimes i force myself to use it , to justify its existence			0
to me , making do with less - almost to the point of deprivation - feels like a slightly demented badge of honor , a silent scream that says , look , @entity215 , no extras ! but more often than i 'd like to admit , it turns out that i actually do need an item that i 've given away , and i 'm forced to repurchase it			0
two years ago , i donated my treadmill because i joined a gym			0
a year later , i quit the gym because i was n't spending enough time there - and paid $ 1,400 for a new treadmill			0
two springs ago , i donated my space heaters to my children 's school , because ... well , it was n't cold anymore			0
as it turned out , the frost returned the following winter , and i had to shell out $ 70 a piece for four new heaters			0
i once donated a @entity49 cookbook to @entity234 because i had the distressing feeling there might be another one somewhere in my house			0
i realized later that i 'd written some family recipes on the back , so i had to repurchase my own book			0
@entity0 : organizing solutions for every room my greatest de-cluttering challenges are @entity244 , 11 , and @entity245 , 8 , who adore useless stuff just as much as i abhor it			1
on some days , i fantasize about tossing all their toys and books and papers , the daily avalanche that flows from their backpacks			0
it 's a pipe dream i know i will regret entertaining once they are grown			0
and grow they will , into men who will tell their balanced , bewildered wives that their mom never let them bring home stuffed animals or pogo sticks or water guns from their grandparents ' house			0
they 'll recount that they owned one pair of sneakers at a time , plus dress shoes for holidays , because i did n't want the hall closet cluttered			0
that their desire to display @entity273 creations and chess trophies buttressed against my obsessive resistance to blemished surfaces			0
" i ca n't stand so much stuff everywhere , " i recently blurted , surveying the four books and magic wand strewn atop @entity245 's nightstand			1
" stand it , @entity215 , " he replied , not unkindly			0
@entity244 , meanwhile , defiantly displays a framed photo of his fourth - grade @entity285 cast party on his desk			1
i once hid it in the laundry room , hoping he would forget about it			0
a year later , i felt guilty enough to return it to him			0
now he is lobbying to put up a @entity296 poster			0
i have engineered a compromise : he can put up whatever he wants , but on the inside of his closet doors			0
@entity0 : 3 smart new ways to kick pessimism to the curb occasionally , i worry that i 'm depriving my sons of the same sense of control over their environment that i longed for as a child			1
i cringe at the thought that they might not want to come home for spring break to a house with no television to watch the hockey game on , and no coffee table to prop their feet on while they watch it			0
my former husband , who recycled himself two years ago , never shared my fear of clutter but kindly kept his collection of @entity326 masks at the office			1
the first thing i noticed about his new digs was the decorative table that existed solely to display photos of our boys : dozens of pictures of their fully frame - worthy faces			0
he also had flat - screen tvs			0
for a moment , i admired his ability to balance his own aesthetics with the needs of others			0
i doubted that , with his full larders and healthy attitude , he 'd ever have trouble drawing anyone into his home to lean against a throw pillow and watch the game			0
then i retreated to my own gloriously uncluttered home , whose clarity rises up to embrace me as i enter the front door			0
i picked up a stray sneaker and admired a drawing poking out from a backpack			0
eventually i sat , with a mug of coffee that had no words on it , on a couch with just enough pillows to make a decent nest			0
i thought about how lucky i am to live in this perfect , unencumbered space with my two perfect , if cluttery , children			0
i thought about how everything in this house is here because of a carefully considered decision			0
ironically , i 've lived for the past two years in my parents ' real estate clutter , an extra home in a great school district they purchased when i was 3 and held on to for the absurd reason that someday , someone they loved might need it			1
