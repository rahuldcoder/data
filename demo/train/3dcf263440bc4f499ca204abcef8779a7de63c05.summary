a @entity1 couple is facing a $ 3,500 fine and a damaged credit score for doing what many people do after a bad purchasing experience : posting an online review			1
their story -- first reported by @entity11 's affiliate in @entity13 @entity12 -- started in 2008 when @entity14 bought his wife @entity17 gifts off @entity18			1
the items never arrived and the @entity20 said the transaction was automatically canceled			0
" after 30 days , @entity23 said ' hey , there 's no activity here ' and they turned around and gave the money back into my husband 's account and effectively canceled the sale , " @entity22 told @entity11			0
after repeated calls to @entity18 to find out what happened , @entity22 posted a review of the company on ripoffreport.com saying in part , " there is absolutely no way to get in touch with a physical human being			1
" web 's black market peddles drugs , guns more than three years later , the @entity20 received an e-mail appearing to be from @entity18 stating that they would be fined $ 3,500 if the negative review posted on @entity49 was n't taken down within 72 hours			1
" we were shocked that someone would attempt to do this because it 's ridiculous that anyone would turn around and try to extort us like this , " @entity22 said			0
@entity56 lets kids remove online posts they regret the e-mail cited an obscure non-disparagement clause in the terms of use contract that states : " your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits you from taking any action that negatively impacts @entity18			1
" the @entity20 say this clause was added after they purchased the items , citing their 2008 customer agreement which they found			2
legal experts warn that more and more companies are adding this type of language in the fine print as protection			2
" @entity77 does not protect certain kinds of free speech and you can sign a contract giving away your free speech , " according to @entity11 legal analyst @entity84			0
he said he believes @entity18 's terms of use contract is not fair and would likely be thrown out by the court			2
study : 15 % of @entity91 adults are not online the @entity20 tried to take down their online review , but could n't because @entity49 requires the company to enter into arbitration to have a post removed , which would cost $ 2,000 , and @entity18 refused			1
so @entity96 reported the @entity20 ' $ 3,500 unpaid fine to a collections company			1
after that , @entity22 said the couple had trouble getting approved for financing because their credit score took a huge hit			2
@entity11 e-mailed @entity105 and tried multiple phone numbers listed on its website			0
no one responded back and all the numbers were disconnected			0
@entity105 did respond via e-mail to @entity12 , defending its actions , referring to its " terms of sale , " and saying its request that @entity22 remove her post was not blackmail but a " diligent effort to help them avoid ( the fine )			2
" holiday shoppers pledge to buy @entity91 the @entity121 is investigating @entity122 separately and has put the company on alert			0
@entity18 is n't the only company with a so - called non-disparagement clause in its customer agreement terms			1
@entity11 found a similar clause on a vacation rental company , shoredreams.net , that threatens a charge of up to $ 10,000 for online reviews containing " unreasonable negative sentiment			1
" after a @entity11 report about the clause aired , the company removed it from its terms and conditions , citing customer feedback			2
a spokeswoman for shoredreams.net explained that the non-disparagement clause was intended to provide protection against customers who demand compensation by threatening unreasonable negative reviews after leaving a unit			0
the company adds it has never imposed a fine on a customer for violating the clause			1
since the @entity20 ' story first surfaced , a wave of outrage has made its way across the internet against @entity18 and as a result , the company has since protected its @entity156 account and shut down its @entity158 page , according to @entity159			0
the @entity20 say they 're taking their fight all the way to court			0
" we do n't want them to get away with this , " @entity22 said			0
" we are apparently not the only ones that they have done this to , but we are the only ones who are fighting back			0
and we 're not giving up			0
" during this busy online shopping season , retail analysts suggest you take steps to protect yourself by taking the time to read the fine print and ensure a company is legitimate before buying a product online			1
and if you do write a negative review , make sure it 's accurate because you could be sued for libel even if the company does n't have a non-disparagement clause , according to @entity11 legal expert @entity84 .			1
