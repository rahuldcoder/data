president @entity0 gave a historic speech on friday			1
after months of revelations about the extraordinary surveillance capabilities of the @entity5 government -- and the @entity6 in particular -- the president promised to end the bulk collection of telephone records by the @entity6 and to put in place new safeguards for privacy protection of @entity5 citizens and those outside the country			1
let 's give @entity0 credit for signaling a new direction in the ongoing discussion over civil liberties and security			1
it is a good thing , one that should lead to greater freedom and security			1
@entity0 has stopped treating the @entity27 revelations as a public relations issue and chose instead to pursue the hard work of reform and new protections			2
as @entity0 acknowledged , intelligence collection is necessary to a nation 's security , and to all countries in identifying threats			1
but at some point , programs become too vast , concerns about their direction arise , and changes must be made			0
just because the government can do something with technology does not mean it should			0
@entity0 also announced the establishment of a public interest advocate at the @entity47 , the body that has authorized the vast surveillance program			1
the advocate will provide an opportunity for the judges to hear from someone opposed to the surveillance program			0
only after hearing both sides of the argument will the judges make a decision			0
in addition , there are plans to improve oversight of @entity62 -- a secretive process for obtaining access to business records about customers			0
" @entity72 " have become a favorite of the law enforcement community post- 9/11 and have caused real concern among civil libertarians across the political spectrum			0
@entity0 said notification procedures would be established and there would be more openness			2
this is not as much as some had hoped , but still it goes further than was expected			0
finally , @entity0 said he would create a new panel to assess the impact of " @entity81 " on personal privacy			2
the phrase may be clich√© , but the problem is real			0
increasingly data -- and also metadata -- reveal an extraordinary amount of personal information			0
we need a better approach , with technologists and legal scholars , and a deeper engagement from the @entity95 and @entity96 , to make meaningful progress on this critical issue			0
civil libertarians are welcoming @entity0 's proposals			1
from the start , we had urged the end of the @entity6 telephone record program			2
we had also pushed for reforms to the @entity47 , more oversight and accountability for government conduct , and a greater willingness to engage a meaningful debate on the impact that technology is having on privacy and freedom			2
for those outside the @entity5 , the takeaway will be more mixed			2
yes , it is good that the @entity5 president has agreed to stop listening in on the calls of foreign allies , narrow the focus of the @entity5 data collection overseas , and extend legal safeguards to non- @entity5 citizens			1
but still , a larger problem remains for the @entity5			2
for many years the @entity5 has pushed aggressively against efforts in other countries to update data protection laws and put in place new privacy safeguards			2
@entity130 spent the last several years assuring @entity131 that its system of " self - regulation " for the private sector coupled with " vigorous oversight " of government surveillance provides meaningful protection			0
the documents released by @entity27 tell a very different story -- of insufficient oversight , private sector collaboration , and technologies of surveillance gone largely out of control			0
in some instances it was clear that the @entity6 was actually undermining standards necessary for internet security			1
several of the recently released court opinions also suggest that the @entity6 itself did not know what data it was collecting			0
it will not be easy to rein in these powers or to fully understand the consequences of the technologies the @entity5 government has embraced			0
in other words , @entity0 has not said enough yet to assure those outside the @entity5 that the @entity6 will not continue to monitor their activities			1
he also did not fully embrace the efforts under way in many countries to strengthen the right to privacy			0
a relevant historical reference for the president in the surveillance debate is the @entity169 monitoring of the rev. @entity170 and @entity5 opponents of the war in @entity173			1
today the reality is that the @entity6 gathers vast amounts of data on political leaders , private firms and human rights campaigners outside the @entity5			1
@entity0 will need to do much more to make clear that intelligence collection is not a blank check to conduct surveillance on other nations			1
@entity0 has several opportunities coming up to say more about what he will to do to protect privacy , widely viewed around the world as a fundamental human right			1
this year the @entity189 falls on january 28 , @entity190 , a day that marks the creation of the most well - known international framework for privacy protection			0
the @entity5 should be the world 's leader on freedom , not surveillance .			1

@entity199 : give @entity0 credit in signaling a new direction on civil liberties , security
