-- it was a case of déjà vu at @entity3 on wednesday as @entity4 and @entity5 took the opening race for a second day in a row			1
@entity8 proved too classy for rivals in the @entity10 , powering away from @entity11 and @entity12 to land another win for flamboyant @entity15 owner @entity14			1
" gosh , that was magic was n't it ? " former banker @entity14 told reporters			2
" he was just brilliant			2
he 's been a very hard horse to keep right but @entity5 and @entity4 have done a fantastic job with him			1
" @entity21 , one of the brightest stars of national hunt racing , is sadly absent from this year 's @entity3 as vets continue to ponder his irregular heartbeat , but the magnificent @entity26 did have a representative in the winners ' enclosure in the shape of jockey @entity31			1
sprinter @entity21 's regular work rider got up on @entity34 to deny @entity35 on @entity36 in a photo finish in the day 's main handicap			1
beating perennial @entity35 jockey @entity35 added to the pleasure for amateur @entity40 , who said : " i was very , very worried when i could see him coming up to me , but it 's such a great feeling when they jump and travel as well as my horse did			2
i did n't have a clue that i 'd won -- you do n't dream this sort of thing happens			1
" in the day 's feature race , the @entity51 , @entity52 produced the fairytale ending that connections and neutrals were hoping for by running away with the title by six lengths from @entity58 and @entity59			1
purchased for £ 35,000 as a 50th birthday present for businessman @entity61 by 50 of his friends and family , @entity52 runs in silks inspired by @entity66 's other passion , @entity67			1
it was not just the @entity61 family who were celebrating the win ; the horse is trained by @entity72 , who also owns a 25 % share , and ridden by his son @entity74			0
it was @entity74 , in fact , who discovered the horse at a small @entity80 breeding operation and persuaded his father to take the plunge			0
his insistence resulted in his first @entity3 winner			1
" this means so much to me and my family , " said trainer @entity72			0
" it 's something i thought could happen but these things do n't happen very often			0
i suppose i 'm very lucky to have such a great family			0
i 'm proud of all of them			0
" first to congratulate the @entity66 family was @entity14 himself , whose own representative in the race , @entity91 , was pulled up before the finish			0
there could scarcely be a greater contrast between first - time owner @entity66 and @entity14 , one of the sport 's most prominent figures			0
@entity14 , of course , also owns @entity100 , one of the revelations of this jumps season			0
the super mare puts her undefeated record on the line in thursday 's feature race , the @entity109 , where she will face four - time winner @entity111 's			0
meanwhile , former footballer @entity112 may not want to give up the day job just yet			1
on the opening day of the festival he successfully tipped three winners in a row			2
but on wednesday he was notably less successful			2
only one of his three fancied horses ran a place -- @entity121 in the 5:15			2
unfortunately @entity112 had tipped it to win .			0

day two of the @entity3 took place wednesday
@entity8 won the @entity10 with @entity4 in saddle
@entity52 won the @entity51
@entity34 wins @entity130
