-- after @entity6 's " all politics is local , " @entity9 's quip " it 's the economy , stupid , " is perhaps the most oft - quoted truism of modern @entity3 politics			1
but as times change , we should update our aphorisms accordingly			0
just four years ago during @entity3 's presidential election , outsourcing to @entity14 and @entity16 's currency manipulation were the bogeymen , the former blamed for the loss of jobs and the latter for the weakness of exports			1
but increasingly the culprit is the robot			0
automation now removes as many manufacturing jobs from the economy as outsourcing			0
witness the @entity29 , which will have to cut 35,000 jobs by 2015 , and how digitization has forced bookstore chains such as @entity33 into bankruptcy			0
@entity16 , once the beneficiary of offshored manufacturing , also now faces cheaper competitors in @entity38 and technology upgrades : @entity40 -- a subsidiary of @entity41 - based electronics supplier @entity40 -- plans to implement more than one million robots on its assembly lines in @entity16 by 2015			1
we may compete against each other economically , but we are all competing with , and against , technology			2
an updated vocabulary for these circumstances might include the shift from homo economicus to homo technologicus			0
even economists ought to agree			0
@entity53 and @entity54 wrote in the @entity55 that it was constant changes in the " instruments of production " that caused " all fixed , fast - frozen relations " to be " swept away			2
" for @entity62 , technological change was a key driver of " creative destruction			2
" technology increases drive problems that we view as political or economic in nature such as income inequality			2
@entity3 's wealthiest people earn from their innovation and control of technologies , ranging from social media to high - frequency trading			1
if technology drives economics -- rather than the reverse -- then we should elevate the notion of geo - technology above that of geopolitics and geo - economics as well			2
it was around the time of then - candidate @entity9 's 1992 quip about the economy that scholars of international relations began to use the now vogue term " geo - economics			2
" @entity93 wrote that the logic of conflict would unfold in the " grammar of commerce			0
" @entity98 chided his fellow political scientists for not recognizing that " economics is the most important source of power and well - being			1
" today that same statement is true of technology			0
think about it : @entity16 is not a superpower today because it has about twice as many nuclear warheads as it did two decades ago			1
not many people know or care how many nukes @entity16 has ; it has had them since the 1960s , yet we did n't consider @entity16 a superpower then			1
@entity16 's superpower rise is directly attributable to its technological strategy of dominating low - cost manufacturing , accumulating massive surpluses and reserves , and reinvesting that cash into more advanced technologies as well as military hardware			1
the causal flow begins with technology			0
by this logic , @entity16 's recent twelfth five - year plan should be viewed as a more cogent national security strategy than anything offered by the @entity128 in two decades : it pledges $ 1.5 trillion in government support for seven " strategic emerging industries " including alternative energy , biotechnology , next - gen it , high - end manufacturing equipment and advanced materials			1
@entity16 invented none of these fields , but is putting incomparable effort into deploying them at scale			2
@entity16 already controls over half the world 's market in solar cells			1
does the balance of power matter more , or the balance of innovation ? even though technology has become a scapegoat in @entity3 politics , it is also widely recognized as part of the solution			2
the internet creates 2.6 jobs domestically for each one that is lost to automation			0
the new great hope for a grassroots economic revival is the advent of @entity163 , which some call the " next industrial revolution , " for its potential to revive a nationwide @entity168 manufacturing movement			0
small - scale prototypes can be produced in much smaller quantities , and bought and traded on increasingly popular websites like @entity172 , which has over 15 million users and growing			0
technology also enables the increasingly wide and liquid market for task bartering and skill exchanges : @entity179 's @entity178 is already the world 's largest part - time workforce			1
the next wave of job creation could come from green construction , meaning retrofitting for low - emissions buildings and installing smart grid equipment such as solar cells and constructing wind farms			1
our political discourse today obsesses over economic headlines at the expense of technological foresight			0
in @entity3 it passes as penetrating wisdom that @entity196 will be re-elected if unemployment drops below 8 %			0
but @entity3 's structural unemployment wo n't be unwound by statistical sleights of hand			0
what every citizen and worker in the world today needs is not higher iq or @entity206 but higher @entity207 : technology quotient			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 and @entity212 .			1

@entity214 : technology now the most important source of power and well - being
@entity16 's superpower rise is directly attributable to its technological strategies , experts say
next wave of job creation could come from green construction , say @entity211 and @entity212
every citizen needs a higher @entity207 : technology quotient
