@entity0 -- a veteran @entity3 sheriff 's deputy and his younger partner sat tensely in their car thursday in the same patrol district where a former @entity9 cop -- now on the run , accused in three killings -- used to work			1
the two deputies were " on the edge , " they said , monitoring the police radio and the latest news about the rogue ex-cop who has pledged to kill officers in and out of uniform			1
their marked cruiser was ensconced beneath soaring concrete columns supporting the light - rail @entity22			2
in an off - limits parking spot by a " @entity27 " sign , their car faced passing traffic , and the two officers stood watch , wondering whether @entity31 would pass their way			2
" everyone is a lot more on edge , " said one of the deputies , a 24 - year veteran , who was in uniform with a bulletproof vest and his sidearm			1
" we 're just doing a lot more careful observation			2
" we 're listening to the news like you			0
everyone has got their eyes open , " said the deputy , who asked that his name not be published due to security concerns			0
" he 's a scary guy			1
" his partner , sitting behind the wheel , let the senior deputy do much of the talking , but when he paused to listen to the radio , the six - year deputy chimed in			1
timeline in manhunt for former @entity0 cop " we 're just being more observant , " he said , frequently looking toward the morning traffic speeding by the @entity63 station			1
normally , the two officers would be riding the @entity22 , checking passengers for proof of fare payment			0
the officers are common fixtures on the new rail line , which opened last year , and walk through the train cars , issuing tickets for passengers who have n't paid their fare			1
that rail line runs through the heart of the southwest division of the @entity9 , the district where @entity31 , a former @entity9 officer , had been assigned for patrol duty while on the force			1
@entity31 has allegedly written a manifesto pledging " asymmetrical warfare " on officers in and out of uniform , particularly @entity9 officers , but the sheriff 's deputies were taking the threat to include them , too			1
all 10,000 officers in the @entity9 were on " tac alert " thursday , including officers @entity90 and @entity91 , who were patrolling the same division where @entity31 had worked			1
under a tactical alert , all officers are in uniform or available for duty			1
also , all motorcycle officers were taken off the street and put in patrol cars thursday for their own protection , @entity9 said			1
suspect 's grudge dates back to 2007 complaint @entity90 and @entity91 did n't mind giving their names to a @entity1 reporter because they expressed confidence in their department 's numbers			2
" we 're maxed deployed , " @entity90 said , behind the wheel , idling the parked black - and - white			1
" i do n't think he 'll bring the fight into @entity0 i think he has a better chance with a smaller department			1
we have so many resources			0
" it was clear from their manner of speech that all officers were at the ready			0
" these types of events band officers and departments together , and i guess his trying to bring the fight to officers , well , he knows better , " added @entity90 , a 10 - year veteran			1
" his manifesto to exonerate himself does n't make sense			0
" @entity91 , who 's been on the force for 13 years , expressed hope for a peaceful capture of @entity31			0
" i just read bits and pieces of his manifesto and i just hope he 's taken into custody so nobody and no officer gets hurt , " said @entity91			0
@entity90 and @entity91 did n't have a news radio in the car , so the only way they can get news updates is through @entity148 on their cell phones , they said			0
" the department holds this stuff close to their vest			0
i know there 's a lot going on , " @entity90 said about the manhunt for @entity31			0
the officers were given some information about @entity31 during roll call , and some fellow cops remarked they knew of @entity31 but did n't offer much more , @entity90 and @entity91 said			1
" for us patrol guys , it 's just get in your car and we 'll call if we need you , " @entity90 said of the chain of command			1
the partners were assigned to watch for potential problems at an anti-homophobia campaign in the @entity170 neighborhood of @entity171 , at @entity172 and @entity173			0
in @entity174 was conducting free hiv testing and passing out condoms on thursday , which was @entity178			0
opponents had earlier covered up a billboard sign sponsored by the group that said " @entity182 , " and the two officers were watching for any trouble			0
there was none , said the group 's executive director , @entity187			0
alleged cop - killer details threats to @entity9 , why he was driven to violence @entity31 's alleged rampage was portrayed by authorities as revenge killings for his termination from the @entity9			1
@entity31 was an @entity9 officer from 2005 to 2008 , when he was terminated , according to authorities			2
the former officer claimed in a manifesto attributed to him that he was unfairly fired after reporting excessive force by a fellow officer , and he vowed to avenge his termination			0
he also served as a former @entity203 lieutenant who worked with river warfare units and a mobile inshore undersea warfare unit , according to @entity207 records obtained by @entity1			0
his last day with the @entity208 was february 1			0
@entity31 is a suspect in a double murder sunday in @entity211 , @entity212 , authorities said			0
one victim was the daughter of retired @entity0 police officer @entity214 , who handled the appeal of @entity31 's termination and , according to the manifesto , bungled it			1
@entity31 appealed the case to a @entity0 court , where a judge ruled against him in 2011 , according to court records			2
multiple law enforcement agencies have linked @entity31 , 33 , to the shooting of two @entity225 police officers in an ambush at an intersection around 1:30 a.m. thursday			2
one officer , 34 , died			0
about 20 minutes earlier , police believe @entity31 shot at two @entity9 officers assigned to protect off - duty officers named in @entity31 's manifesto , police said			1
a bullet grazed one of the officers , and the wound was not life - threatening			2
damage to the squad car prevented the officers from pursuing @entity31 , police said			2
that shooting took place in @entity243 , also located in @entity225 , at 1:25 a.m. thursday , said @entity0 police			2
for a former officer to be a suspected cop killer is beyond imagination for many law enforcement officers , whose culture bonds them so tightly that many can spot another officer out of uniform just by their demeanor and a nod of the head			0
the two sheriff 's deputies acknowledged this subculture			1
when asked how alarming it must be for a former officer to be at war with police , the younger deputy expressed acceptance			2
" i guess it shows we 're people too , " he said .			0

two @entity9 cops patrol in the ex-cop 's old beat , saying they " do n't think he 'll bring the fight into @entity0 "
