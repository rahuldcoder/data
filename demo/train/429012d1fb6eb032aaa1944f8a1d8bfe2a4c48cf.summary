-- itÂ ´ s the ultimate repair tool			1
a silicone material that can be shaped like playdough , can bond to almost any surface and after a few hours of exposure to air becomes a super tough , durable rubber			1
" @entity15 " - coming from the @entity17 word for " play " - is now being used to fix leaky pipes , create custom - made handles and even help a disabled , fingerless canoeist modify one of her paddles			1
unlike existing moldable putty , @entity15 does n't go rock hard when dry , but stays flexible , waterproof and heat resistant up to 180 degrees @entity21 ( 356 degrees @entity22 )			1
" we think that @entity15 can be something as big or bigger than duct tape , superglue or anything else that you use to repair , " says its @entity17 - born inventor @entity15			1
however , like many great inventions before , it only came into existence by chance			2
@entity15 , a design student at the @entity33 in @entity34 at the time , had been messing around in the workshop , trying out new combinations of materials when she started mixing silicone adhesive and wood - waste into small balls			1
they looked like wood when finished , but when you threw them on the floor they would bounce			2
" i thought , that 's random , " says @entity15 , who admits many other designers might have then left it at that			1
" but for me , i knew that there was something there			2
there was something a little bit magical			2
i just did n't know what it was			2
" it was only as she began using bits of the material around her home to repair things that she had what she calls her " eureka moment " and came to realize its real usefulness and application			1
" every time i 'd make up a batch of it for my experiments , i 'd have bits left over			2
i hate wasting stuff so i started using the leftovers around my house just to fix little things , i modified a kitchen knife that was really uncomfortable			2
my sink plug was just slightly too small , so i just made a little ring to make that work			2
" i was doing it completely unconsciously			2
and i was there beating myself up going , i ca n't find the application for this material , until my boyfriend @entity85 said to me one night , maybe there 's not this one perfect thing for this material			1
maybe what you 're doing in the kitchen is actually the thing			0
" it took six years of hard work before the first packs of her material were being sold to consumers			1
her story from the workshop to marketplace , together with the help of business partners and friends , has been a familiar one of luck , near bankruptcy and late salvation			0
" it has been a long journey , " she says			0
" first of all , the technology has been difficult to invent			0
but second of all , you know , we 're not a big company with big budgets behind us			0
" send your photos of @entity15 fixes to @entity0 's @entity117 " we 've been doing it on a shoestring for years			1
and anyone who 's ever pitched for investment funding will know it 's a bitch			0
it 's really difficult for an unlikely group of people to get investment funding			0
i mean , we probably pitched to over 100 investors where we got , maybe two or three over the years			0
" around 2008 , five years after she first came up with the idea , with a product almost ready to launch , @entity15 and her small team of partners found themselves close to running out of money , as promised investment from major manufacturers failed to materialize			1
watch : see how versatile and strong @entity15 is in a last ditch attempt , they decided to scrape together enough money to build their own " little cottage industry factory " and do it themselves			1
and with the help of family and friends they put together 1,000 packs			0
" what we 're quite good at is design , it 's what we do , so we had a fantastic package design and a really great website design			0
when we went live it looked like we were much bigger than we were			0
" from that point , the investors came on board fast and in less than three years they have ballooned to annual sales of $ 2 million , a staff of 25 and a customer base of more than 100,000 across 100 countries			0
perhaps , the most unique thing about @entity15 is that its practical uses is being demonstrated not by its inventor , but by the general public			1
thousands of people have posted comments and pictures on @entity168 , @entity169 and other websites showing how they have put the material to good use			1
" we get emails every day with pictures and stories of what people have done			0
they do things with it that we could n't have dreamed of			0
it feels like magic sometimes			0
" @entity15 says her product is the ultimate tool in the battle against wastefulness			1
" i think it can really benefit our urban way of life , where we depend so much on buying new things all the time and replacing them if they 're not quite right			0
it 's not only wasteful , but it does n't make the most of us as human beings with all the potential that we have			0

@entity15 is a self - setting rubber material which sticks tight to almost any surface
