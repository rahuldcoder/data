@entity0 -- @entity3 car makers are grappling with sluggish demand at home and abroad as well as a strong yen			0
so perhaps it 's not a big surprise that one corporate titan is now trying an age - old marketing ploy aimed at female drivers			2
@entity12 has released a new model of the @entity14 , interestingly named " she 's			1
" some of it might sound like an idea straight from the 1950s -- a car made for women -- complete with numerous pink features , as well as a windshield and air conditioning that claims to help a woman 's sensitive skin			1
in fact , the idea of marketing a car to women was tried in the 1950s			1
@entity30 's @entity29 featured space for a woman 's lipstick and purse			0
it too came in pink -- but faded fast , lasting only from 1955 to 1956			0
back in 2000 , @entity37 teamed up with @entity38 , pitching a minivan complete with a washing machine and microwave			1
the " soccer moms " never put it to the test though , as the @entity44 never cruised past the concept stage			0
" she 's " sticking to a fairly predictable road with pink stitching in the seats , pink tweaks in the dashboard and a windshield that the company says blocks more ultraviolet rays			1
@entity12 also adds , the " plasma cluster " air conditioning helps prevent dry skin			2
( when we asked about the perhaps more grammatically correct ' hers , ' we were told that the former apparently sounded better			0
) if you do n't care for pink , there 's white or brown as well			2
and when we asked if a @entity12 executive really did tell a @entity3 newspaper that the colors are meant to " match a woman 's eye shadow , " we 're told yes -- with no tinge of regret that some women might find such a comment offensive			1
we also posed the question to @entity78 's designer : essentially , was she concerned about offending some women with such a product ? we were told people have different tastes			2
and in @entity3 , there is also a strong culture of all things cute -- or " kawaii			0
" they are not wrong			0
@entity89 is the one word we heard nearly every time we showed the car 's brochure to women on the streets of @entity0			1
but of course what is more crucial to any car 's success are its sales			0
and when it comes to that , @entity12 without giving a precise number says so far " she 's " exceeding their expectations .			1
