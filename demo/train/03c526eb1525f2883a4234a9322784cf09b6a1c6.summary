@entity0 -- in her grilling on @entity4 on wednesday , @entity5 secretary @entity2 reiterated a frequent assertion in the @entity8 sales pitch --- consumers have options when shopping for insurance plans on the health care exchanges			1
" the 15 % of our neighbors and friends who are uninsured have affordable new options in a competitive market , " @entity2 said in her testimony to the @entity14			2
after apology , @entity2 subpoenaed over @entity8 website but a @entity1 analysis found that consumer options vary significantly from state to state , and many @entity26 are discovering that they have very few options			1
fact - checking @entity8 claims in @entity33 and @entity34 , for example , residents shopping on the exchanges can only purchase plans from a single company			1
contrast that with the state - operated exchange in @entity39 which has 16 participating companies , an average of five per county			2
@entity43 , which is on the federal exchange , has 13 participating insurers , although some counties in the state have only one			2
so what prices are people finding in states where only one insurer lists on the exchange ? in states with many insurers on exchanges , plans vary far more dramatically in price			2
some are more expensive but many are significantly cheaper			0
big difference state - to - state in @entity67 , for example , with 10 insurance companies listed on the exchange , a 27 - year - old can buy a silver plan from @entity69 for $ 133.83			2
@entity69 is the same insurance company that operates on the @entity33 exchange			1
a 27 - year - old in @entity33 , meanwhile , can purchase silver plans ranging in price from $ 193.93 to $ 250.69 a month			1
in @entity34 , that same individual can browse silver plans costing from $ 236.46 and $ 238.62 a month			1
these prices do not include offsets from subsidies			0
individuals are also able to view less expensive bronze or catastrophic plans on the exchanges ( the latter only being available for buyers under age 30 ) as well as more expensive gold plans			0
platinum plans , which offer the highest level of coverage , are not available in @entity33 or @entity34 according to the data on @entity91			1
your options under @entity8 a @entity5 report released in late september asserted that an average of eight insurance companies would be participating in states on the federal exchange ; try telling that to a resident of @entity34 or @entity33 with their single choice			1
in general , urban and suburban counties with higher populations tend to have more insurers , while it 's common for rural counties to be limited to one or two options			1
the @entity109 estimates that 12 million people live in counties with only one insurer , compared to the 117 million in counties with more than five insurers			0
there is no data to indicate how many of those people will be shopping for insurance in the exchange			0
special coverage : health care in @entity26 rural areas suffer ; not profitable rural areas are , on the whole , less desirable to insurance companies because they offer a smaller pool of potential customers			1
it is also more difficult for insurance companies to make a profit in rural counties because there are fewer health care providers and lack of competition allows regional hospitals to charge more for services			1
yet , the number of insurance companies operating on the exchange is often a fraction of the number that actively sells insurance in the private market			0
in @entity146 , for instance , there are six companies that actively sell insurance but only two advertise plans on the exchange			0
in @entity153 , nine companies sell plans , but only two of those are on the exchange and only one of those sells statewide			0
some companies are choosing not to participate in certain areas because they are waiting to see how the implementation of @entity8 plays out in the first year			1
it remains to be seen how many will ultimately sign on despite the problems the exchange has faced so far			0
the technical problems facing the website are , to some extent , drawing attention away from the shortage of insurance options			2
but some lawmakers are now calling on the administration to address the issue			0
a group of senators and congressmen from @entity178 wrote to @entity2 on monday , expressing their frustration at the lack of options in their state and calling on her to release information about her department 's correspondence with state officials			1
" before the law 's implementation , state insurance officials claimed that there would be as many as eight carriers offering coverage in the individual market , " wrote senator @entity188 and representatives @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			2
" however , a consumer logging on to the @entity202 website will find , at most , four plans offering coverage , while 60 % of the state will have no more than two provider options			1
" " this is a disappointing , if unsurprising , failure of the reforms promised by @entity8 , which will mean decreased competition among plans , leading to higher costs , higher premiums , and less consumer choice			1
" lawmakers : @entity178 families pay more @entity178 is one of six states that operate exchanges in partnership with the federal government			0
the authors of the letter say that families in @entity178 now have to pay 100 % -600 % higher premiums under @entity8			1
@entity39 site lists bakery , mechanic for @entity8 help a lack of options is certainly having an effect on insurance prices -- how much is still up for debate			1
@entity234 of the @entity109 looked into the link between options and price , and found that in counties with more than five insurers , the average premium was about $ 20 a month less than in areas with only one insurer			2
@entity234 specifically compared the pricing available for a 40 - year - old individual shopping for a silver plan			0
the @entity249 administration , for its part , has discounted the significance of this analysis			0
" under the @entity8 , nearly all consumers ( about 95 % ) will have a choice of two or more health insurance issuers , often many more , " @entity5 spokeswoman @entity252 said in a statement to @entity1 , " and nearly all consumers ( about 95 % ) live in states with average premiums below earlier estimates			1
" @entity252 added that , " in the marketplace , new rating and benefit rules along with bans on pre-existing exclusions allow insurers to compete for customers based on price and quality			0
" this information is also reflected in the september @entity5 report			0
what else can go wrong with @entity8 ? comparisons difficult to make premiums on the federal exchange are lower than those previously projected , but comparing rate changes in any given state is tricky , according to @entity234 , who co-authored a report for @entity280 in september outlining the changes that individuals in the private market could expect			1
because all plans must offer an expanded set of benefits under the @entity8 , they can not be compared straightforwardly to plans offered in the past			2
another reason why insurance options and prices vary so significantly from region to region has to do with how state governments choose to use their rate review authority , which was expanded under the @entity8			1
in some states , officials can prevent insurance companies from raising rates if they believe those rates are unjustified , and some states have used this authority to keep prices down on the exchanges			0
other states , such as @entity307 , have acted to formally reject their rate review authority , thereby preventing any state influence in prices			0
state laws can also play a role in promoting insurance competition			0
in @entity315 , for example , there is a state requirement that prevents insurance companies from cherry - picking which counties they offer @entity321 plans in , according to @entity322 of @entity324 spokeswoman @entity323 â € ” although they can selectively offer hmo plans			0
because of this rule , @entity326 across the state have multiple insurers to choose from			0
@entity1 's @entity330 and @entity331 contributed to this report			2

@entity1 analysis shows @entity8 choices , premiums vary from state to state
in @entity33 and @entity34 , consumers only have single choice
rural areas have fewer @entity8 options because of *sparse* population , providers
@entity280 study shows those with more choices pay lower premiums
