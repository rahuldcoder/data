-- you would n't think that gay rights would be on a collision course with immigration reform			1
after all , what does one of these things have to do with another ? not all that much			2
yet , the fact is , these two worthwhile causes are about to collide , running right into one another at high speed			2
all for the sake of politics			0
here 's why : the gang of @entity16 's bipartisan immigration reform compromise bill -- " @entity14 , @entity17 , and @entity18 " -- combines border security and temporary guest workers with a pathway to green cards and @entity24 citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity24			1
you 've probably heard about how there are many on the right who want to kill the bill to please @entity33 nativists			2
the weapon of choice seems to be the amendment process ; more than 300 changes were proposed			2
for example , one person gunning for the legislation is sen. @entity40 of @entity41 , who has proposed an amendment that dismantles the pathway to @entity24 citizenship			1
@entity40 would welcome more legal immigrants by expanding the high - skilled temporary worker program			1
but the senator opposes giving illegal immigrants @entity24 citizenship			2
the @entity40 amendment says that " no person who has previously been willfully present in the @entity24 while not in lawful status shall be eligible for @entity24 citizenship			1
" that amounts to a lifetime ban			0
the pathway should be long and difficult , but there has to be a pathway			0
it ca n't just be scrapped			0
these people broke the law , but it 's a civil infraction , not capital murder			0
but you might not have heard the other half of the story -- that there also are those on the left who would like to see the bill defeated , even if they have to be more clever and discreet about their efforts to kill it			1
the group that they want to please is organized labor , where despite the public pronouncements of labor union leaders that they support immigration reform , the rank - and - file may not be so easily convinced			1
many of today 's union members -- especially in rust belt states like @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , etc -- still see foreign workers the same way that previous generations of union members saw them : as competition and a barrier to higher wages			0
@entity93 panel tackles border security in immigration bill in 1986 , the last time that @entity97 passed meaningful immigration reform , the @entity96 fought the effort tooth and nail			1
not much has changed since then			0
oh , the leaders are singing a different tune			0
but , at the grassroots level , there is still resistance			0
over the years , i 've done radio interviews and given speeches where i 've been confronted by self - described union members -- electricians , plumbers , carpenters , construction workers -- who complain about illegal immigrants taking jobs and allowing employers to pay lower wages			0
in 2007 , @entity118 , who was then president of @entity96 , helped kill a bipartisan immigration reform bill by coming out against guest workers and firing off a letter to @entity122 telling them not to support any bill that included that provision			1
sen. @entity125 of @entity126 successfully proposed an amendment to weaken the guest workers provision			2
republicans yanked their support , and the bill died			1
six years later , business and labor have agreed to a plan for a guest worker program			0
but union members are still threatened by immigrant labor			0
are union opponents of immigration reform still pulling the strings of some @entity122 ? @entity142 chairman @entity141 has filed an amendment to the @entity145 bill that would allow gay @entity24 with foreign - born partners to sponsor them for green cards just like heterosexual couples can			1
@entity141 can follow through by introducing the amendment , either in committee or on the @entity93 floor			1
to be impacted , gay couples do n't even have to be married ; the proposed amendment -- known as the @entity154 -- is designed to help " permanent partners " of @entity24 citizens or legal residents apply for a green card and defines " permanent partner " merely as someone older than 18 and involved in a financially interdependent , committed relationship			1
still , according to a group called @entity163 , only about 35,000 - 40,000 gay couples would be affected			1
@entity93 watchers say if the gay partners measure is introduced in the @entity142 , it is likely to pass along @entity169 lines and become part of the @entity93 bill			1
that could be the end			0
according to @entity175 , the @entity174 opposes the @entity141 amendment , and it could withdraw its support for the entire bill			1
the same goes for evangelical @entity180 groups , and most @entity182 lawmakers			0
and so , for the sake of the estimated 40,000 same - sex couples that would be affected by such an obscure change , an estimated 11 million people will be out of luck			2
for his part , @entity141 has said that he does n't think his amendment will kill the bill			1
then he must be the only person in @entity195 who thinks that			0
@entity197 called the @entity141 amendment " the most serious threat to bipartisan immigration reform			1
" sen. @entity200 , @entity201 , de facto leader of the @entity145 , was more blunt			0
he told @entity197 that reform is " difficult enough as it is " and that the gay partners amendment " will virtually guarantee that ( the bill ) wo n't pass " and that " the coalition that helped put it together will fall apart			1
" that 's the whole idea			0
the latest shenanigan by @entity122 is n't about gay rights			2
it 's about game playing			0
and when the games are done , what was the best hope for immigration reform in a quarter century may go down the tubes , and all that will be left to do is mop it up			1
@entity122 will have to find new ways to convince furious @entity220 voters that it was @entity182 who killed the bill , and @entity182 will be forced to run for cover			2
the legislation is n't perfect			0
but it would improve the lives of millions of illegal immigrants who , at least , would be given some sort of protective status so they would n't have to worry about being unceremoniously scooped up and shipped out of the country by the @entity233 deportation machine while they pick up milk for their kids ' cereal			0
not everyone who might support the gay partner amendment is simply doing the bidding of labor unions			1
i 'm sure that many gay rights advocates are pushing for the change with the best of intentions and for legitimate reasons			2
they think this battle is worth fighting , even if maybe this is n't the best time and place to fight it			0
still , this is beyond sneaky			0
@entity122 thought of everything , even having the task of amending the bill fall to a senator from @entity260 , a state where , according to the @entity263 , @entity262 account for just 1.6 % of the population -- just in case there is a backlash from @entity220 voters			2
by the way , president @entity233 has said that he supports @entity141 's amendment			1
the president also claims to support immigration reform			1
it 's something that we hear @entity233 and other @entity122 say all the time , and which -- with stunts like this -- becomes less and less believable every time we hear it			0
this time they have gone too far			0
if this amendment is proposed , and support for the bill fades , and immigration reform dies on the vine , @entity262 need to stop paying deference to the @entity169 and instead make it pay a price			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity289 .			2

immigration reform bill could be sunk by amendments from left and right , says @entity289
he says reform died in 2007 after a " *poison* pill " amendment by @entity169 senator
@entity40 and @entity141 have introduced amendments that could doom bill , he says
@entity289 : @entity141 amendment on gay couples will *energize* opponents of immigration reform
