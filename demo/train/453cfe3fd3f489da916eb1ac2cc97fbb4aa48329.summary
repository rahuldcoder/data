-- the @entity2 drone strike that killed @entity3 , an @entity2 cleric who was born in @entity4 and who would go on to become an @entity7 leader in @entity8 , did not silence his siren call to jihad			1
that fact was underlined thursday by the indictment against @entity13 , who together with his brother , @entity14 , allegedly carried out the deadly @entity15 on april 15			0
some time before the @entity17 bombings , @entity13 downloaded a digital copy of a book for which @entity3 , who died in 2011 , had written the foreword			2
the book directed @entity22 not to give allegiance to countries such as the @entity2 that have invaded @entity22 lands			0
four days after the @entity17 bombings , surrounded by police and fearing death while hiding in a boat in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity13 wrote messages that seemed to echo @entity3 's ideas such as " the @entity2 government is killing our innocent civilians " and " we @entity22 are one body ; you hurt one , you hurt us all			1
" the @entity38 are only the tip of @entity3 's influence on @entity2 militants			1
according to a count by the @entity45 , 24 " homegrown " violent jihadist extremists in the @entity2 who have been indicted or convicted of terrorism or have been killed while engaged in violent jihad since 2001 read @entity3 's propaganda or maintained contact with him			1
this accounts for around one in five of all jihadist extremists indicted , convicted or killed since @entity3 's influence was cited for the first time in court documents in 2007 , when his name turned up among the literature being read by members of a plot to attack the @entity60 military base in southern @entity61			1
from the grave , terrorist inspires a new generation @entity3 first came to the attention of the @entity66 while he was living in @entity67 where he had come into contact with two of the 9/11 hijackers in 2000			0
the @entity66 investigated those connections but was unable to discover if @entity3 had any nefarious connections to the hijackers			0
@entity3 was working as an imam in @entity75 in 2002			0
he then traveled to the @entity76 and then to @entity8 where his family was from			0
in 2007 , after a spell in a @entity8 jail that he blamed on the @entity2 , @entity3 became more radicalized and he adopted an increasingly strident @entity81 tone in his sermons , which were widely distributed on the @entity83			2
soon @entity3 joined up with @entity84			2
his role at first was as a spiritual adviser			0
but he became more involved in operations over time			0
for instance , he played a central role in the recruitment of the @entity93 " underwear bomber " @entity94 , who tried to blow up @entity96 over @entity97 on christmas day 2009 , court documents showed			0
since @entity3 's death in the 2011 drone strike , other militants have continued to be influenced by @entity3 's propaganda			1
@entity102 , a 21 - year old @entity103 on a student visa , was arrested in 2012 for plotting to bomb the @entity105			0
@entity102 told a government informant that @entity3 's ideas had influenced him			1
in december 2012 , @entity108 and @entity109 were arrested in @entity110 while attempting to travel to fight for @entity111 , the @entity84 affiliate in @entity112			0
according to the indictment @entity113 provided an informant with compact discs containing lectures by @entity3 , and @entity108 watched @entity3 's videos			1
it is not surprising that @entity3 's influence has not disappeared following his death			1
@entity3 's role in the radicalization of homegrown extremists was not primarily that of directing and facilitating operations			1
only four @entity2 - based extremists maintained contact with @entity3 rather than simply reading or watching his propaganda , according to the @entity45 count			2
authorities say @entity132 maj. @entity131 , accused of murder in the 2009 @entity134 , @entity135 , shooting spree that killed 13 people , communicated with @entity3 by e-mail prior to the attack			2
he also followed @entity3 's publications very closely			1
however , a commission conducted after the attack to review the @entity66 's failure to prevent the shooting found no evidence that @entity3 directed @entity131 's attack			2
@entity3 also is said to have played an important role in the radicalization of @entity148 , a @entity75 resident who planned to join @entity111			0
according to a report by the @entity150 on @entity151 , @entity148 rapidly radicalized after his conversion to @entity153 in the summer of 2008 and was heavily influenced by @entity3			0
@entity148 began to post his writings on @entity3 's blog and began an e-mail correspondence with him , authorities have said			1
@entity148 decided to join @entity111 's struggle in @entity112 because of @entity3 's teachings on jihad , according to the congressional report			1
@entity148 was arrested as he was about to fly to @entity162 from @entity163 in july 2010			0
looking to the future , the role of @entity3 's propaganda as a driver of homegrown extremism will largely be determined by whether the materials he produced before he died remain relevant and easily available on the many websites that distribute his lectures			1
the @entity17 bombings remind us that at least as of now , @entity3 continues to exert his influence even from beyond the grave .			2

@entity3 was killed by a @entity2 drone strike in 2011 , but continues to influence jihadists
@entity180 notes that the cleric 's influence was clear in @entity184 indictment
other terrorism cases in the @entity2 bear imprint of @entity3 's *statements* , @entity180 says
@entity190 : will others *sympathetic* to @entity84 continue to spread his teachings ?
