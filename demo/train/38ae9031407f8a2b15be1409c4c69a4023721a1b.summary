it is a tale of tragedy meets election - year politics			0
as the nation reels from yet another mass murder , in which the killer shot some of his victims before taking his own life , two rival proposals aimed at improving mental health -- and supporters hope curbing mass gun violence by extension -- are before congressional lawmakers			1
a measure sponsored by rep. @entity16 , a @entity18 @entity17 and clinical psychologist , seeks to get states to revise standards for committing the severely mentally ill to hospitals			2
his bill , which has bipartisan support , also includes a controversial proposal that seeks to empower families and judges to intervene on behalf of severely mentally ill adults and , in some cases , compel court - ordered therapy and medication			2
@entity16 's effort would also significantly dial back federal funding to the @entity36 @entity35 , which spends more than $ 3 billion annually on care and is an agency that @entity16 does not think is effective			2
his bill has the backing of the @entity40 , the @entity41 and the @entity42 , among other groups			0
on thursday , he will also outline before a @entity45 subcommittee the results of his yearlong look into federal mental health programs -- an investigation sparked by the 2012 mass shooting at @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53			1
can @entity54 ? treading carefully on guns " the privacy laws were to prevent mistreatment from health care ... not meant to keep people from being treated in health care , " @entity16 said on @entity57 's @entity56 on wednesday he added that in many of the recent mass shootings , the parents were aware of the gunman 's mental health issues but were legally powerless			1
" people knew when something was going on			0
what about the rights of society ? when someone says ' we do n't want you forcing them into treatment , ' look , i get that , " @entity16 said			0
" but society is saying when the signs are there , that someone is gravely disabled or gravely ill from mental illness , a brain illness , treat them			2
denial is not a treatment			0
" a competing measure from rep. @entity88 , a politically vulnerable @entity90 @entity89 struck by gunfire when his former boss , then - rep. @entity92 was shot and severely wounded in 2011 , also takes a mental health approach			1
his legislation would more broadly improve mental health care through added federal financial assistance for counseling , research and education efforts			1
stage set for partisan fight his measure has the seal of approval from a number of organizations , including the @entity108 , the @entity109 and @entity110			2
" we know that one of every four @entity36 will have a mental illness at least once in their lifetime			0
investing in mental health services in our communities and early identification and prevention of mental illness will save both lives and money , " @entity88 said in a statement on his web page			1
the pending showdown over the two measures -- neither of which directly addresses the type of mass gun violence that ended lives in @entity131 , @entity52 and so many other cities -- sets the stage for a partisan fight over overhauling the nation 's mental health system			1
" it 's not what 's in their hands , it 's what is in their mind and heart that we 've got to deal with , " @entity16 said on " @entity56			0
" " @entity143 has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation bar none			2
and so it did n't work there			0
" tackling mental health and gun policy is a thorny issue , but one that needs to be addressed , rep. @entity151 , @entity153 - @entity152 , told the @entity155 this week			1
" we 've got to look at how we define mental illness , who is denied weapons and who is not , and focus the discussion , " @entity151 , who has pushed for tougher firearms measures , told the paper			0
" we have to have this debate			0
" initiatives focusing on mental health were among the nearly two dozen executive actions put in place by the @entity169 after @entity52			1
young , angry and socially alienated the debate will unfold as the nation digests the actions of @entity173 , 22 , a former @entity174 student who police say fatally stabbed three people and shot three others in that city before taking his own life , friday			0
his parents had alerted authorities to their son 's mental illness and signs , they say , pointed to the danger he might one day pose			2
and , as has happened after @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity52 , @entity194 and other shootings in other places , the victims ' families and neighbors plead for justice , for an end to gun violence , for a change in laws			1
" what , what has changed ? have we learned nothing ? where the hell is the leadership , " a weeping @entity210 , whose son , @entity211 , a @entity212 @entity131 college student who was shot by @entity173 , told @entity57			2
" my kid died because nobody responded to what happened at @entity51			0
" father of shooting victim chastises politicians , demands new gun laws in what has become part of a familiar ritual following mass shootings in @entity36 , advocates call for action and politicos , especially those in @entity194 , project solemnity before retreating to their respective corners of the intractable gun debate			1
" shame on us for allowing this to continue , " said sen. @entity231 , @entity143 , who championed firearms reforms that failed in @entity233 following @entity52			1
dems also weigh gun bill in another effort , @entity169 @entity239 leaders said wednesday they were weighing whether to push an amendment to a spending bill aimed at strengthening background checks for gun buyers			0
but they acknowledged it would likely prove unsuccessful			0
the @entity169 is also pushing to fund gun violence prevention studies for the first time in roughly 20 years , an effort resisted by @entity17 critics who accuse the @entity250 administration of playing politics with taxpayer funds			0
political experts say there 's little visibility on the issue , even if the conversation centers on mental health , which has routinely presented itself in the roster of @entity36 's mass shootings			1
as details emerged over the weekend in @entity143 , @entity173 's history of mental health issues apparently was no secret to his family			1
a family friend said he had seen therapists since childhood			0
the public push for reforms is fickle and is largely influenced by moment - to - moment tragedy , said @entity272 , the chief of police for @entity274 , @entity275 , a clinical psychologist and adviser to the pro-gun rights group @entity278			0
" our attention span is so short we never focus on this complicated problem long enough to address the problem , let alone begin to fix it , " @entity272 said in a statement			0
support for gun control has hit peaks and valleys since 1993			0
that 's when the @entity290 came about after the attempted assassination of @entity292 and established a federal background check program for gun purchases			1
according to a @entity57 / @entity296 survey conducted in december , 49 % of @entity36 said they supported stricter gun control laws , while 50 % opposed them			2
that fell from the 55 % who backed tougher measures a few weeks after the @entity52 shootings			0
states take the lead stymied federal legislative actions have sent advocates for stricter controls looking for new ways to have an impact			1
the gun control fights have now moved to the states where legislatures have weighed more than 1,000 proposals , according to an analysis by the @entity314			2
the battle over gun policy : old fight , new strategies and according to data collected for @entity57 by the @entity324 , more than half of the nation 's legislatures -- those dominated by @entity17 -- weighed bills that would have nullified any federal ban on military style assault weapons and limits on large magazines			1
will states go where @entity233 has n't on gun laws ? a number of measures at the state level deal with mental health			1
in @entity338 , the @entity17 - controlled legislature passed a bill requiring that mental health records of " someone acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity " be sent to the @entity345			1
according to data from the @entity347 's @entity345 , roughly 1 % of gun permit applicants who failed to pass a background check over the past 14 years , or 10,180 people , were denied for reasons related to mental health .			1

lawmakers have two bills tackling mental health in *aftermath* of @entity131 shooting
such efforts have failed before and political experts doubt there 's much political will
since @entity233 has failed to act , states have *enacted* a number of gun reform laws
families of victims , advocates frustrated by lack of federal action
