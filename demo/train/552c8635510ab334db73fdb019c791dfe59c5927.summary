@entity0 -- just months after the 9/11 attacks , the @entity2 appeared to have its biggest catch in the newly launched war on terror			1
@entity7 , considered one of @entity10 's senior lieutenants , lay in a pool of blood on a street in @entity14 , @entity15 , having been shot three times during a @entity2 - coordinated raid on a house where a group of suspected terrorists was building a bomb			1
@entity23 operative @entity22 , who helped plan the raid , rushed to the scene			1
but when he gazed down at the critically wounded man , it did n't quite look like the person he had seen in a 4 - year - old passport			0
in his new book , " @entity37 , " @entity22 gives an insider 's view of his secret life as a spy and his role in fighting the war on terror			1
@entity22 said he was able to quickly verify @entity7 's identity by sending a picture of his ear to @entity23 headquarters in @entity42			1
" i did n't realize until that night that no two people have the same ears			0
it 's like a fingerprint , " he said			0
the @entity2 spy was ordered by then - cia director @entity48 to do everything in his power to keep @entity7 alive and to never let him out of his sight			0
that 's exactly what @entity22 did			1
rushed to a rundown @entity15 hospital , @entity7 barely made it through surgery			0
@entity57 had apparently gotten out to @entity10 where he was being treated			2
" @entity10 people started driving by the hospital just opening fire on the hospital , " @entity22 said , and a @entity15 security officer quickly arranged for a helicopter to transfer @entity7 to a military base			1
once on the base , @entity22 used a sheet to tie the comatose @entity7 to his bed and then stood watch			2
when @entity7 finally woke up , @entity22 tried to speak with him in @entity69			2
@entity7 refused , telling him in perfect @entity70 that he would not talk in what he called " @entity73 's language			0
" strangely enough , @entity22 said , @entity7 then asked for a glass of red wine			2
after a few hours of sleep , the prisoner pleaded for @entity22 to kill him -- to smother him with a pillow			2
after a couple of days , @entity7 was transferred to an undisclosed location for further treatment			0
that was the last time @entity22 saw him			2
@entity22 said his conversations with @entity7 were surprising			2
" i expected an irrational , radical , hate - filled , hard - core terrorist , and what i got was a frightened young guy who realized he was in way over his head , had made terrible mistakes and was going to pay for it			0
" @entity22 also tells the story of @entity7 's cell phone ringing shortly after his capture			1
no one could answer it because @entity97 agents who took part in the raid had placed the phone in a sealed evidence bag and would n't open it			0
@entity22 said a valuable lead may have been lost			2
" i should have opened the bag and snatched the phone , " the former @entity23 operative said			2
@entity106 played a prominent role in @entity22 's @entity23 career , most notably his role in supporting the @entity2 policy to go to war			1
in summer 2002 , @entity22 was back working at headquarters in @entity42 when he was summoned to a top - secret meeting			0
he said he was told the @entity115 administration had decided the @entity2 was going to invade @entity106 in the spring -- it was a done deal			1
his job was to support the mission			0
@entity22 said he was dumbfounded			0
" here was someone at the @entity23 , obviously plugged into the plans of the executive branch , telling us that the public debate in @entity124 , reflected almost daily in the press , meant nothing			1
" months later , @entity124 passed a war resolution			0
the book is filled with many more stories about @entity22 's experiences as a spy , including how he tried to avoid surveillance in @entity133 and discovered he was being tailed , what it was like being in charge of foreign agents , and the fear of a pending terrorist attack just before september 11 , 2001			1
@entity22 also discussed the @entity23 's use of harsh interrogation techniques on detainees			1
in 2007 , several years after he left the agency , @entity22 was the first official to publicly confirm @entity0 's worst - kept secret : that @entity7 had been waterboarded			1
he did n't have firsthand knowledge , but he said he had read cables that indicated the simulated drowning technique was used just once , because @entity7 cracked and provided actionable intelligence			0
however , a government report released in summer 2009 said the technique was actually used 83 times against @entity7			0
@entity22 said he now feels he was duped by the agency			0
he questioned whether any useful information really came from the detainee and said he believes " it caused more damage to our national prestige than was worth it			1
" @entity22 left the @entity23 in 2004 after serving 14 years in the agency			1
he 's now a senior investigator on the @entity160 .			0

new book is @entity22 's view of life as a spy , role in fighting war on terror
@entity22 , who spent 14 years in @entity23 , tells of capture of an @entity10 senior lieutenant
he also talks about 9/11 , says decision to invade @entity106 made before public debate ended
he says waterboarding " caused more damage to our national prestige than was worth it "
