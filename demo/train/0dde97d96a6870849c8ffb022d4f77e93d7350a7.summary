@entity0 -- @entity2 is under close scrutiny over how it will cope with the influx of travelers for the @entity6 , but at least it has one fan in @entity9 writer @entity8			1
@entity10 -- author of best - selling novels including " @entity12 " -- lived at the airport for seven days last year when he was @entity2 's " writer in residence			1
" " i loved it , " says @entity10			1
" i enjoyed living at the airport , i enjoyed the romance of opening my curtains and there was the runway			0
" during his stay he spent time with pilots , police and security services , but one of the highlights was a visit to the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) -- what @entity10 calls " the true @entity33			1
" read more : in numbers : @entity2 braced for @entity36 surge " everything passes through the @entity31 so you get rattlesnakes that some idiot smuggled back from the @entity43 desert , you get polo ponies from @entity45 and you get cheetahs that are en route from @entity48 to @entity49 that are in a box that 's too small and seized , " he says			1
@entity10 recalls following an @entity31 worker on a call out to a plane returning from @entity54 to capture two smuggled rattlesnakes that had got loose			1
" all the mad stuff happens on quite a frequent basis			0
( the @entity31 employee ) said the best thing to pick up a snake that 's loose on a jumbo is a pillowcase and he was just wonderfully matter - of - fact about it , " he says			1
but @entity10 also saw the darker side of the transport hub and says he was shocked to discover the lengths some people go to in an attempt to illegally stay in @entity9			2
" i saw a man from @entity73 , granted asylum in @entity75 , but he wanted to come to the @entity9 , " recalls @entity10			2
" under the terms of his residency in @entity75 he was n't allowed to come to the @entity9 and he ate his travel documents as he was getting off the flight so he could say , ' no , i 've just arrived from my war - torn homeland			2
' it 's quite common			0
" the experience of being there was so extreme , to be with an immigration officer when they 're interviewing someone and they know they 've got 50 condoms full of cocaine inside them and they will not admit it			2
" you do n't see humanity at its very best when you 're at an airport ... you see the immigration and customs officers are lied to most of the time			0
they see ( humanity ) probably at its worst , at its most criminal and venal			0
" read more : a day in the life of @entity2 another surprise for @entity10 was seeing a woman arrive on a flight from overseas dressed in a wedding gown because she wanted to marry prince @entity109 -- an apparently common occurrence ( it used to be @entity112 before he got hitched , adds @entity10			1
) the incident formed part of one of the short stories in @entity10 ' book " departures : seven stories from @entity2 , " inspired by his stay at the airport			1
another tale was inspired by his discovery that the airport 's air traffic control was manned by " youngsters in their cargo pants			0
" @entity10 says : " i thought that venerable elderly gentlemen that looked something like a @entity134 presenter would be in charge of the skies and of course , it 's all the children of @entity140 , kids that have grown up with computers			1
" there 's that moment where you look around the air traffic control tower , this wonderful panoramic view of the sun coming up , the skylight of @entity0 50 miles away , ( and you think ) where are all the grown ups ? " quiz : test your @entity2 knowledge but @entity10 was impressed with their professionalism and says many of @entity2 's employees were childhood airplane enthusiasts who never lost their passion			1
" the thing that is most striking about @entity2 is how totally obsessive the people are who work there , " he says			2
" it 's not just another job , for the firemen , for the pilots , for the air traffic controllers , for the people at customs , the people at immigration			0
they really feel as though they 're in touch with something epic , something that 's bigger than they are			0
" and he was impressed by the sheer size of the airport			0
@entity10 says : " the thing about @entity2 is that it 's a secret city more than an airport			1
it 's a place where 70,000 people work			0
it 's a place where 75 million people pass through every year			0
" it 's got its own methodology , its own rituals and is far more than just another hub			0
it 's like another city			2
