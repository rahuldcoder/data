@entity0 wheels her bag towards the airstairs of the @entity3 sitting quietly on the tarmac at @entity5			1
today she 'll be flying from @entity7 's capital city to @entity8 in @entity9			1
a short hop south with a flying time of around 1 hour and 20 minutes			2
but for @entity0 , 26 , it is n't about the destination			1
as @entity7 's first female pilot , it 's about the journey and her highest priority is to get passengers safely to their terminus			1
" growing up i wanted to be a pilot when i was four , " says @entity0 , who became a pilot for @entity7 's national airline carrier , @entity20 , at 24			1
" i 'd never been inside a cockpit but i used to see a plane in the sky and i imagined that thing must be flown by someone			0
" i had to go for it			0
even though it looked like a long shot , it was my only shot -- that 's how i saw it so i went for it , and here i am			2
" dream big during her childhood , @entity0 's family would move on a regular basis due to her father 's work as a pastor			1
but her desire to take to the skies never wavered , even after her father passed away in a plane crash in the @entity44 , when the passenger aircraft he was traveling on overshot the runway and hit some terrain			0

" [ but ] an accident is an accident			0
like i said , if someone gets hit by a car , you do n't stop driving			0
" you ca n't live life being scared an in fear of anything			0
if something is bound to happen , you ca n't stop it			0
" going all in thus , @entity0 continued to work toward her goal of becoming a pilot and achieving what no other woman in her country had done before			1
once she completed high school , she packed her things and bought a one - way ticket to attend pilot school in @entity52			2
" when i went it was a one - way decision , " she says			0
" if they bounce me , i 'll just pack my things and come back -- so that was the way i joined pilot school , and it was a long journey			2
" more from @entity79 voices a year later , @entity0 began training with @entity20 in @entity81 and her exploration of the aviation world began			1
" my greatest memories are flying to different cities , " she says			2
" being in the sky gives you a whole other view -- you get to see what they call a bird 's eye view of everything			0
" sexism in the skies ? now , the young pilot has become a pioneer in a male - dominated industry in @entity7 , and yet she knows she is constantly being closely watched because of her gender			1
" no one ever says , ' oh it 's a male crew aircraft that crashed , ' even though it 's been many of the sort , " she says			0
" but you know , if there 's a woman on board and something happens , you know , definitely you 're going to be mentioned			1
" @entity0 recalls a previous incident where a passenger realized that the pilot for his flight was a woman shortly after arriving at the gate and refused to get on the flight			1
" the cabin crew said we 'll gladly leave you behind			0
you 've already paid the ticket , so if your reason is that basic and shallow , it 's not because of safety reasons			0
it 's just because you do n't want to fly with a woman , we 'll gladly leave you behind			1
" @entity0 refuses to let her critics win and is determined to continue being a role model for others			1
she hopes that her achievements can provide inspiration to other women who might not think they can attain their dreams jobs			0
" @entity131 has changed , " she says			0
" women are out there working , technology has changed , and everyone has the brains to do something , now it 's not about how much bicep or how much energy you have			2
