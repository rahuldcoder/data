-- a former @entity2 president who once led a military crackdown on drug cartels now has a new pitch : creating a legal system to produce , distribute and tax marijuana			1
@entity8 is joining a group of entrepreneurs in @entity11 this week to discuss that possibility , six months after voters in @entity14 approved a ballot measure allowing recreational marijuana use			1
as president , @entity17 launched @entity19 , which sent soldiers and federal police to eight cities across the country in 2005 as drug cartels expanded their reach			1
but since leaving office in 2006 , he 's taken a significantly softer stance			0
for years , he 's pushed for drug legalization			1
using military force to fight cartels does n't work , he argues , but legalization would			1
" with this we will avoid the violence , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity33 on thursday			1
" we will control the criminals and reduce their income , and at the same time it would become a transparent , accountable business in the hands of businessmen			1
" speaking to reporters earlier thursday , @entity8 praised @entity14 's efforts to legalize marijuana and " change the paradigm			1
" " in @entity2 we welcome this initiative , " he said , " because the cost of the war in the case of @entity2 is becoming unbearable , too high for @entity2 , @entity49 and the rest of the world			1
" legalization measures , he argued , ultimately topple the foundations of organized crime			2
" we must get out of this trap , and here is the opportunity , ' @entity8 said			1
" now this group here is moving accordingly from words into plans , and from plans into action , and from action into the arena			2
to play the real game this group must understand the need to make good , safe , and legal use of these new laws , for the benefit of the people and the common good			0
" as @entity8 spoke , @entity73 nodded in agreement			1
the former @entity76 executive is heading up a new business venture that aims to create the first national brand of retail cannabis in the @entity80			1
@entity8 told @entity0 he was not involved in @entity73 's venture , but sat beside him because he supports the push to move to put the drug trade in the hands of businessmen , not criminals			1
" by making cannabis illegal , we have instead turned it into a tool for violence , exploited by criminals and organized crime , spanning many countries , " @entity73 said			1
" ladies and gentlemen , this is a unique moment in history			0
the @entity99 of the prohibition of cannabis is weak , and it is crumbling as we speak			2
and just as happened in @entity99 in 1989 , the old guards who used to protect the wall of cannabis prohibition are laying down their weapons and walking away			2
" opponents criticize legalization but drug legalization still has fierce critics			2
@entity111 administration officials have repeatedly stressed their opposition to such proposals when they 've been floated in other countries			0
last year , @entity115 , who directed the @entity116 from 2001 to 2009 , told @entity0 that decriminalization is " utterly self - defeating " and would cause more crime			0
@entity2 's current president , @entity119 , has also expressed his doubts about large - scale legalization measures			1
in @entity2 , marijuana use is not crime , but production and distribution of the drug are			1
@entity127 a @entity128 told @entity0 last year that despite his reservations , the way the war on drugs is waged may have to change in light of changing @entity80 policies such as the recent referendums in @entity136 and @entity14			0
" personally , i am not in favor of legalization of drugs ... because it 's not just about marijuana			2
it seems to me that is a gateway through which people will start taking much more harmful drugs , " @entity127 a @entity128 said			0
" but it 's clear that this thing that has happened in two states in the near future could bring us to rethinking the strategy			0
" complicated political landscape in november , voters in both @entity136 and @entity14 approved ballot measures allowing for the personal , recreational use of marijuana			2
nearly 20 other states permit the use of marijuana for medical reasons			2
the new laws put @entity136 and @entity14 at odds with the federal government , which classifies marijuana as an illegal substance			0
since pot is still listed in the nation 's @entity169 , federal raids of pot businesses continue at feverish pace			0
in 2012 alone , federal agencies seized more than 2,500 indoor grow operations , killing close to 300,000 plants			0
the situation makes the so - called legal marijuana industry a risky one			0
a dispensary could be in full compliance with state laws , but the feds could still raid them			0
and the financial picture is complicated , too			0
figuring out how to tax cash marijuana sales is a challenge both @entity136 and @entity14 are facing			0
on thursday , @entity73 said he 's up to the challenge			0
" we have waited long enough for some sort of a green light from @entity189 in fact , the silence from our nation 's capital has been deafening , " he said			0
" we are moving forward with our plans to build a national and eventually international network of cannabis businesses			1
" follow @entity197 on @entity199 @entity0 's @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 and @entity204 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0

with legalization , @entity8 says , " we avoid the violence " of the drug trade
he says marijuana production and distribution should be in the hands of businessmen
a former @entity76 executive says he plans to create a national cannabis brand
the former @entity2 president says he is n't involved in the business , but supports it
