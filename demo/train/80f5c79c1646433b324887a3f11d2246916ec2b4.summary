-- much like the expressive era that her music defined , @entity1 danced her way through the 1970s with extraordinary success , posting successive hits that electrified dance floors and prompted her coronation as @entity10 's queen of disco			1
but her own life was marked by the highs and lows of the ballads that she energetically sang , and even at the height of her popularity , she once took steps toward suicide -- only to be stopped by the interruption of hotel maids			1
she overcame the negative dimensions of relentless public attention , and her legacy as a genre - leading vocalist endures decades later among music enthusiasts , even resulting in an appearance a few years ago on " @entity29			2
" @entity1 died thursday morning from cancer , her publicist , @entity31 , said			1
she was surrounded by her family in @entity33 , he said			2
said her family in a statement : " early this morning , we lost @entity36 , a woman of many gifts , the greatest being her faith			2
while we grieve her passing , we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy			2
" @entity1 , who was born in @entity43 and whose father was a butcher and mother a schoolteacher , sang from the moment she learned to talk , and her debut performance came in church at age 10 when the scheduled singer did n't show and the pastor asked @entity1 to step in			1
@entity1 later recalled that the church performance left worshipers in tears			1

" well , you have to get people 's attention some kind of way , " @entity1 told the magazine , " but i 'm not just sex , sex , sex			1
i would never want to be a one - dimensional person like that			0
share your images or memories of @entity1 " i can sing songs like ' @entity95 , ' but i can also sing ballads , light opera , things from musical comedies , church hymns -- all kinds of things			1
plus i can write , act and think			0
" @entity1 added that she did n't " want to be known for just one thing			1
" in a 2003 interview with @entity0 , she said the initial absence of a manager led her to do provocative photo shoots			2
her public image as a sex symbol and diva conflicted with her religious upbringing , she said			0
her grandfather was a minister and her father a church deacon			0
" yes , it was a big complex and the image was sort of created around me , " @entity1 said			1
" i was sort of there , but not consciously there			0
and i did n't have anybody sort of on my side at that point , fighting for me , except for me , being in the middle			0
and then people would say , you know , ' @entity126 down here and do this			0
' and you know , whatever , " @entity1 said			1
her big break came when she was a teenager and auditioned in @entity131 for a @entity133 version of " hair			0
" she landed a role and went to @entity133			0
when she achieved success by her mid- 20s , she was n't able to handle it well			1
" it was tough , " @entity1 said			1
" i think success is always a surprise , you know			1
" she eventually suffered depression and found herself in an abusive relationship			0
" if people are in abusive relationships , i think they need to get out of them or at least get help , " @entity1 said			1
she lived in fear during that relationship , she said			0
" thank @entity149 this person was from @entity133 , so they were deported			0
and then i was able to sort of be free , but i was afraid for years , " she said			0
her hits included " @entity153 , " " @entity154 , " and " @entity155			0
" summer first rose to fame the mid- 1970s , thanks to " @entity159			1
" the song , with @entity1 's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans supported by heavily synthesized backing tracks , fueled the decade 's disco mania and hit no. 2 in 1976			1
summer followed the song with such hits as " @entity170 , " " @entity64 " and a disco version of the @entity172 hit " @entity173 , " which outdid @entity172 ' version by hitting no. 1 on @entity176 's hot 100 singles chart			2
it was @entity1 's first of four chart - toppers			1
but with her 1979 album " @entity154 , " @entity1 broke out of the disco mold as the genre , stimulated by the success of the @entity186 ' " @entity187 " soundtrack , was feeling a backlash			1
" @entity154 " demonstrated @entity1 's vocal and stylistic range and produced two no. 1 hits , " @entity153 " and " @entity154 , " as well as a @entity192 ballad , " @entity193			1
" fans , friends react to @entity1 's death however , @entity1 had some trouble adjusting to the changing times			1
her next album , " @entity199 , " went for more of a rock feel			0
it produced a top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially disappointing after the success of " bad girls , " a double album that spent five weeks at no. 1			2
it was n't until 1983 's " @entity155 , " which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit , that @entity1 's fame approached its late ' 70s zenith			1
in 2003 , she wrote of the demands of being superstar in a memoir , " ordinary girl : @entity217			1
" she disclosed the pressures associated with being a superstar and revealed that at the peak of her popularity , the disco queen even contemplated suicide			2
in an interview with @entity0 that year , she was asked about sticking her foot out of a hotel window to get a feel of whether to jump			0
" no , i was n't getting a feel			0
i was attempting to go			0
i did n't plan it			0
i just decided , i 'm out of here , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
then the maids walked in			0
" then i sought help			0
i realized that i had a serious problem with depression , and i went to a doctor and he gave me some medication , " @entity1 said			2
more recently , she appeared on the finale of the popular show " @entity29 " in 2008 and performed some of her greatest hits with the show 's leading female singers			0
that year , she released her album " @entity245 , " and in an interview with @entity0 , she spoke of her musical " mission			0
" " i do n't like to be categorized because i think that i am an instrument , and if you play me , i 'll make whatever particular sound is supposed to come out for that color , " @entity1 said			2
