how much information is too much information ? when @entity5 tennis player @entity4 said in a post-match interview that she lost her @entity8 round due to " girl things , " she sparked a debate about menstruation that quickly spread across the world			1
" has sport 's last taboo been broken ? " wondered commentators , after the 22 - year - old described feeling " light - headed " and " low on energy , " putting it down to her period			1
" we talk about sex quite openly , we talk about breast enlargements , we talk about so many things that people do n't even bat an eyelid about these days , " former @entity5 number one tennis player , @entity20 , told @entity1			1
" yet this particular subject never gets discussed			0
and i can understand why -- it 's a bit uncomfortable viewing is n't it ? " said the founder of her own line of leak - proof underwear called " @entity32			1
" " but the fact that @entity4 said what she said in a very innocent , charming way , i think it made people think ' wow ' this does happen to athletes at that particular time of the month			1
" with the world 's media scrutinizing their every move , it often feels as though nothing is out of bounds when discussing the physical and mental conditions of elite athletes			1
indeed , @entity54 footballer @entity53 did n't bat an eyelid as he told reporters he 'd torn his anus in a goal - saving stretch during last year 's @entity60			2
while @entity62 cricketer @entity61 flew home early from an international tour in 2011 , revealing he was suffering depression			0
" women 's business " so why the silence when it comes to a fact of nature that affects most female athletes -- and in @entity4 's case apparently influenced the outcome of her match ? " even grown women in the office , when they make the walk from their cubicle to the bathroom discreetly tuck a tampon or pad up their sleeve or decide whether to carry their purse with them -- not to hide the blood itself , but the fact that they 're bleeding , " @entity86 , author of " the curse : confronting the @entity88 , @entity89 , " told @entity1			1
she said the secrecy was partly to do with workplaces historically being " men 's spaces , " which women have adapted to			2
" i think it 's also linked to sexuality in ways that makes people feel uncomfortable , " @entity86 added			2
" girl things " while @entity86 supported @entity4 's candor , she said describing menstruation as " girl things " perpetuated a culture of concealment			1
" i wish she could have just been direct about it , because i think that adds to the weirdness surrounding this topic , " said @entity86			0
" our history of talking about menstruation is really full of euphemisms that people have used for centuries : wrong time of the month ; communists in the summer house ; the misery ; under the weather ; weeping wound ; package of troubles			2
" could the @entity5 number one tennis player have actually set back feminism in the sports arena by bringing up her period in the first place ? " it 's potentially problematic for women because our periods can get used against us , " said @entity86			1
" it 's easy to dismiss a woman as ' oh she 's on her rags ' if someone is angry or emotional			2
it 's a way of discounting the validity of what a woman is saying			2
" professional cyclist , @entity139 , said there was a fine line between openness and undermining women 's sporting abilities			1
" i feel very protective of our sport			0
you do n't want to pull the ' girl card , ' because we 've fought so hard for equal representation , " she told @entity1			0
" it 's true that the day before or the day after i started my period , i was a little weaker			0
was i ever so weak that i felt i lost a race because of it ? no. " in @entity20 's case , she once felt so dizzy from her period she had to walk away from a @entity158 match -- " i did n't feel like i could talk about why i had to do this			1
like so many female athletes i suffered in silence , " she said			0
man up ? every woman is different and menstruation need n't be the deciding factor on the playing field			0
after all , @entity5 runner @entity167 told the @entity168 ​ she had her period when she broke the world record at the @entity171 in 2002			1
in some cases , professional cyclists naturally miss periods due to low body weight , said @entity139			0
​ on the tennis circuit , players sometimes take the pill to skip their period during a major competition said @entity20 , who recalled the immense pressure of playing at @entity182 in a white skirt , with her period , and the world 's camera lenses trained on her every move			0
" it 's a nightmare , particularly because the skirts are flapping up in the wind the whole time and you definitely do n't want to have an accident , " she said			0
" there is only one toilet break a set -- and matches can go on a long time ! " breaking the cycle so does that mean @entity4 has heralded a new era of openness among female athletes ? " what she has done is open up a world debate , and i think it will be easier to talk about it in the future because that subject has been broached now			1
i think it 's been quite groundbreaking , " said @entity20			0
" but whether or not a journalist is brave enough in a press conference to ask : ' did you lose today because you had your period ? ' i 'm not sure if that 's ever going to be the case			0
" insight : @entity217 stays calm over tennis ' @entity219 ' big interview : @entity222 -- ' @entity223 ' who defied prejudice			0
