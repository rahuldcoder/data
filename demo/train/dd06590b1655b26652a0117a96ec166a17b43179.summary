@entity0 -- a federal court has given the @entity4 administration the go - ahead to continue funding embryonic stem - cell research			1
the controversial 2 - 1 decision friday is a victory for supporters of federally funded testing for a range of diseases and illnesses			1
the @entity14 lifted an injunction imposed last year by a federal judge , who said all embryonic stem - cell research at the @entity19 amounted to destruction of embryos , in violation of congressional spending laws			1
legislation passed in 1996 law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in the creation or destruction of human embryos " for research purposes			2
" private money had been used to gather batches of the developing cells at @entity36 - run labs			0
the current administration had broken with the @entity38 and issued rules in 2009 permitting those cells to be reproduced in controlled conditions and for work on them to move forward			0
@entity4 officials have been at odds with many members of @entity46 over whether the the @entity19 research actually causes an embryo 's destruction , as prohibited by the @entity50			2
two scientists had brought a lawsuit to block further research			0
but the three - judge panel concluded in its 21 - page ruling , " the plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail because @entity57 is ambiguous and the @entity19 seems reasonably to have concluded " the law does not ban research using embryonic stem cells			1
the ruling does not deal with separate research on adult stem cells , which remains permissible under federal law			0
the plaintiffs have the option of now taking their appeal to the @entity36 @entity68 for review			0
the issue at this stage deals only with the lifting of the injunction allowing funding to continue for embryonic stem - cell research			1
the larger constitutional issues are still being debated at the district court level			0
the government had argued that an extensive list of research projects outlined by the @entity19 would have to be shelved if the court had not acted and granted a stay			2
the field of embryonic stem - cell research has been highly controversial , because in most cases the research process involves destroying the embryo , typically four or five days old , after removing stem cells			1
these cells are then blank and can become any cell in the body			0
embryonic stem - cell research differs from other kinds of stem - cell research , which do n't require embryos			1
some scientists believe embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body			2
the case began with a lawsuit against the @entity19 by scientists opposed to use of embryonic stem cells , a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization , the nonprofit @entity112 and others			2
when the injunction was first issued by judge @entity118 in august , @entity114 , executive director of @entity115 -- one of the groups that filed the lawsuit -- said he supported adult stem - cell research that does n't require destroying embryos			1
" frequently people will say , ' why are you opposed to stem - cell research ? ' and of course our answer is , ' we 're not , ' " @entity114 said			1
" we 're opposed to the destruction of the embryos to get embryo stem cells			0
" when president @entity131 first approved federal funding of human embryonic stem - cell research in 2001 , 60 existing stem - cell lines -- which were created before august 9 , 2001 -- qualified for federal funding			1
of those , only 21 actually were usable for scientists			0
@entity131 later rescinded the funding			0
since the @entity4 administration 's rules went into effect , at least total of 75 stem cell lines qualify for federal funding , according to the @entity19			2
@entity19 has invested more than $ 500 million in human embryonic stem - cell research			1
because such embryos are destroyed when stem cells are removed for research , most opponents believe this is moral issue			0
scientists conducting such research said continued federal funding is necessary , saying they would have greater flexibility to work collaboratively within labs , across labs and around the world on the latest treatments and breakthroughs			0
supporters of embryonic stem - cell research say their studies have shown promise to treat a range of debilitating conditions including diabetes , parkinson 's disease , cancers , and spinal cord injuries			1
the case is @entity169 v. @entity170 ( 10 - 5287 ) .			0

new : the @entity19 has invested more than $ 500 million in human embryonic stem - cell research
the @entity0 appeals court rules 2 - 1
it is a victory for supporters of federally funded embryonic stem - cell research
