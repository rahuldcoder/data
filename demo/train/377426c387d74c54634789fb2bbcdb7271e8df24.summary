at first , it 's hard to tell what these extraordinary works are made from			2
@entity4 's giant , glowing sculptures resemble backlit jewels , as if they have been carved out of phosphorescent rock			1
a luminous green box appears to be crafted from fine jade , even if its large size and intricate detail make this implausible			2
another piece , labeled a " crystal marsupial " , is a translucent purple figure which twists to reveal what looks like a glittering core of amethysts			0
in fact , all of these objects are sculpted from a resin which has become @entity4 's signature medium as an artist and jeweler			1
these synthetic resins are so versatile that they can be molded into huge structures , or cut and polished to achieve the luster of gems			0
over the past decade , @entity4 has shaped this material into fantastic sculptures , including a fluorescent garden filled with jewels and creatures and a pair of turquoise crystal horns which can be worn as a headpiece			1
@entity4 is fascinated by the morphology of animals and minerals , and her works often have the air of natural history specimens , given a psychedelic twist with their rainbow pigments and exaggerated shapes			1
one of her characteristic installations is a baroque display case stuffed with a variety of dazzling , incongruous objects : a neon skeleton , an artificial heart , a bright stalactite			0
for the @entity56 artist , there is an excitement about reinventing organic forms and traditional tableaux in day - glo colors , resulting in a mash - up of historical styles			0
she admits that she is " always drawn to an eclectic mix of influences , things which are aesthetically excessive and colorful and blingy			0
" these display cases are a combination of 19th century diorama and modern fashion editorial , in which scientific models are imbued with futuristic glamor			1
in addition to her acclaimed gallery work , @entity4 has had a long association with fashion and jewelry design			1
in 2010 , she collaborated with fashion designers @entity78 and @entity80 of the @entity82 label romance was born to produce a @entity84 - themed collection called @entity85 , featuring models in crystal - studded breastplates and multi-colored antlers			0
she also worked with romance was @entity90 to produce a series of fabrics -- and even a line of wallpaper -- depicting a maze of flora and fauna in acid colors			0
for @entity4 , it makes sense to move between exhibitions , high fashion , and ready - to - wear items , since it allows her to work with " vastly differing scales and functionality			1
different fields bring unique challenges , but resin is quite a forgiving material , with flexibility and wide scope for experimentation			2
it can be built up and cut down in extreme ways			0
" working on jewelry enables @entity4 to perfect the precise cutting she uses for her gallery pieces , while ambitious sculptural ideas often find their way into her accessories			1
a crystal bird perched on a cuff functions as both a bracelet and a free - standing sculpture			0
@entity4 's jewelry line ranges from chunky bangles in cartoon colors to striking but ethereal pieces , such as a cluster of rose - pink shards jutting out from the wrist			1
an iridescent blue ring with two bug - eye " gems " foregrounds the artist 's sense of humor , while a pair of shimmering earrings with scalloped edges is both delicate and flashy			0
resin allows multiple color changes to be incorporated into one piece , so that a ring graduates from milky white to translucent pink , and a cuff shows shades of blue seeping into yellow			2
it is important to @entity4 that the transition to wearable art is made without losing the outlandish and distinctive quality of her style			1
her designs for jewelry often draw on the same techniques as her sculptures : in particular , the use of " acrylic icing " to give an opalescent sheen to surfaces , as seen in her pearl - colored rings			1
at the same time , she is able to embrace the contradictions of working in both the art world and the luxury market , making sumptuous designs out of faux gems and applying painstaking modeling to synthetic materials			0
some of @entity4 's fashion collaborations can currently be seen at the @entity173			1
in the meantime , she is busy researching ideas for new sculptures			2
her next exhibition at @entity179 's @entity178 will have a geological focus , combining crystal structures with mixed media such as technicolor hair extensions she sources in @entity184 and a kind of plastic which can be dyed in hot water			2
she also intends to work the geological theme into her accessories : " i think of my jewelry as small - scale sculptures , like a three - dimensional print with a small edition run			2
the only difference is that with jewelery , there has to be some serious consideration of the function and how it 's worn , whereas a sculpture can be much more impractical			0
