-- the medical journal that published a now - retracted paper linking childhood vaccines to autism conducted only a cursory investigation into complaints about the research when they emerged , another @entity2 journal reported tuesday			1
the author of the 1998 paper , dr. @entity14 , and his co-authors reaffirmed their findings after complaints about @entity14 's research surfaced in 2004			0
however , the medical journal @entity19 reported tuesday , the examination into how the study was conducted was led by the editor of the @entity23 , which published the paper , and involved " no formal investigation " of the allegations			1
" in short , the accused were investigating themselves , " the @entity19 reported			1
tuesday 's article is the third and last of a series published by @entity19 , which has called @entity14 's study an " elaborate fraud " and accused him of planning to launch a business venture " off the back of the vaccine scare			1

" it noted that 10 of @entity14 's co-authors had their names removed from the paper after learning in 2004 that @entity14 had been paid by lawyers to help build a case against vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose -- and pointed out that @entity14 's most damning assertion was made at a separate news conference after the study was published , not in the paper that the journal published			1
" from this point forward , @entity14 encouraged the media and a grassroots network of anti-vaccine advocates to believe that this vaccine may cause autism , " the @entity23 said			0
it added , " at no point did we actively defend @entity14 's public statements about the link between mmr and autism			0
" the journal said the @entity82 , where @entity14 worked at the time of the publication , conducted the 2004 investigation that led to a partial retraction by the paper 's co-authors			2
" at each stage we acted as soon as we had the evidence to do so , " it said			0
