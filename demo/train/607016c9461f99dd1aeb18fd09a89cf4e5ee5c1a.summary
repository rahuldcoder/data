-- @entity2 's impressive defense of his @entity4 title continued monday as he dispatched 20th seed @entity5 in straight sets in their fourth round match on @entity9			1
it was always going to be a tall order for the 6 foot 8 inch @entity12 to overcome the @entity13 who once again looked fit and focused in front of an expectant crowd			0
@entity2 engineered a break of serve in the third game of the match before serving out a competitive first set 6 - 4			1
@entity2 stormed into a 3 - 0 lead in the second before the heavens opened and the players left the court while the roof was closed			2
when they resumed , it was @entity5 who began more brightly earning two break points on the @entity2 serve			1
he saved the first but could do nothing with the second as an @entity5 pile driver took a heavy net cord with the @entity13 unable to get up to the ball			2
@entity2 was still a break up and in no mood to slip up again			2
games went with serve up until the ninth when @entity5 , serving to stay in the set , lost four points in succession to give @entity2 a two - set lead			1
@entity5 's booming 130 mph - plus serve had delivered 63 aces in the first three rounds but he could only manage a further nine on monday			1
the third set was tighter			0
@entity2 earned five break points in the eighth game but could n't close out and with the chance gone the set went to a tiebreak			2
like the set , it was nip and tuck with @entity5 earning the first set point at 6 - 5 only for @entity2 to save it , win the next point and earn his first match point			1
another competitive rally ended when @entity2 swiped a cross-court backhand winner and seal victory 6 - 4 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 8/6 )			2
" when it was outdoors , i played very well and was in a good position			0
when we came back indoors , he started to strike the ball a bit better , he started serving better , " @entity2 said afterwards			1
" it 's a good win because he was playing well at the end and making it very tough for me			2
it 's good to get through in straight sets			2
" the 11th seed @entity75 awaits the world no. 5 in the quarterfinals			2
the @entity78 , who won the @entity81 event prior to @entity4 , was also a straight sets winner defeating @entity84 's @entity83 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 8/6 ) 6 - 2			0
no. 1 seed @entity85 is also safely through to the last eight after negotiating a potentially tricky tie with @entity89 's @entity88			0
@entity90 won in straight sets with the almost identical scoreline to @entity2 , who he followed onto @entity9			2
the @entity93 's 6 - 3 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7/5 ) victory -- his 13th in total over @entity88 -- puts him through to face @entity97 's @entity96 who beat @entity89 's @entity98 7 - 6 ( 10/8 ) 6 - 4 6 - 4			0
@entity99 bounds on @entity99 has already won one @entity4 title -- now she 's targeting the real deal			1

@entity99 , who prevailed 7 - 6 7 - 5 , will face either @entity109 or @entity111 's @entity110 for a place in the semifinals			1
the 13th seed has reached the last four of the previous two grand slams and is confident following her victory over @entity108 , who had defeated @entity118 in the previous round			1
" i 'm really excited			0
i 'm proud of the way i fought out there , " @entity99 told the tournament 's official website			1
" @entity108 is a really great player			2
it was tough ( under the roof ) , but it was the same for both of us			0
i need to focus on one match at a time , so that is my focus			0
this is what i 've worked for , but i want to keep winning matches			0
" elsewhere , @entity135 's @entity4 dream came to shuddering halt after she was dumped out in the fourth round monday			1
the former @entity138 was beaten 6 - 2 7 - 5 by the @entity140 's @entity139 , who qualified for her first ever grand slam quarterfinal			1
@entity142 , who defeated @entity144 champion @entity143 in the previous round , will now face either fellow @entity140 and 2011 champion @entity146 for a place in the last four			0
" even when i had some opportunities i made some stupid mistakes or did n't play the balls properly			0
you know , it was kind of , i guess , one of those matches , " @entity135 , the @entity151 , seeded 16 at @entity4 , told reporters			1
" of course i am a little disappointed sitting here			0
obviously i would have loved to have been further			0
" the fourth round has been the furthest i have got here , where i feel like i should have gone further some years , but , you know , i guess sometimes that happens			1
" you just have to get yourself back up and keep working and come back next time			0

the 19 - year - old , who won the @entity184 tournament in the lead - up to @entity4 , failed to recover from a thigh problem which she suffered on saturday while trailing 6 - 7 6 - 6			0
" i have a muscle strain in my abductor			0
it 's not terrible , not really a long recovery time , " keys told reporters			0
" but they were warning me it could get worse , make recovery time even longer			0
" keys ' injury means that @entity179 moves into the last 16 where she will play @entity111 's @entity198			1
@entity198 , who reached the final last year , overcame @entity93 's @entity199 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 1			1
