-- it 's an entirely preventable disease , and when diagnosed early , it 's easily treatable			1
yet @entity3 still claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year			1
all it takes is a single mosquito bite and you can become infected			2
in 2012 , the tropical disease caused 627,000 deaths internationally , 90 % of them in @entity10			1
@entity11 , a @entity13 biotechnologist - turned - enterpreneur , is hoping to bring that number down to zero			1
through his company @entity15 , @entity11 has developed a self - testing kit that can diagnose the disease in less than 30 minutes , and put sufferers on the path to recovery faster			1
" i decided to look at what is the most needing product in @entity10 at the moment			1
and malaria , malaria is big , " says @entity11			1
" i then decided to look at a malaria test that can actually show you the strain of malaria you have -- the type of malaria -- so ( doctors ) know which treatment to give you , and then also to see if the treatment is working or not			1
so i developed a test that can do all of that			1
" merging science and business the best think about @entity11 ' test is the price : they cost roughly 30 cents each , a fact @entity11 takes immense pride in			1
" the fact that ( they are affordable ) of course makes it more accessible to the public			2
it is very satisfying to know that a farm worker in a rural area does n't have to worry about going to a doctor			2
our product can be used at the point of care , " he says			2
" you do n't need skilled labor to use it : prick ( your finger ) , run the test and wait for results			1
there 's a lot of diamonds in the rough ( is @entity10 ) , a lot of potential , and diseases and epidemics are killing off this potential			1
so it has a knock - on effect that is important			2
" given @entity72 is only 30 - years old , he 's achieved an incredible amount			2
like many young entrepreneurs , he has drawn inspiration from his childhood and surroundings			2
using this experience , @entity72 creates local solutions for everyday problems			2
for the @entity83 native , malaria prevention is just the beginning			1
saying ' no ' to drugs @entity11 has turned his attention to another scourge affecting his community : drug use			0
" on the @entity91 , there was a big problem of drugs abuse , " he recalls			0
" people abusing methamphetamine , et cetera			0
fortunately for me , although i grew up on the @entity91 where it 's very prevalent , i used sport to keep me away from bad habits and getting involved with the wrong crowd			0
" now , as the founder of his own biotech company , @entity11 created a test capable of detecting a range of drugs , including amphetamines , benzyls , cocaine , methamphetamine , heroine and morphine			1
the idea first came to him when , following a survey of users , he identified the correlation between drug use and eye movement			0
following this revelation , @entity11 had a light - bulb movement that would take his product development to the next level			0
" we get five to 10 megapixel cameras on mobile phones			0
i thought to myself : ' imagine developing an app for your phone where you can actually test your kids for drugs by using the flash as a light stimulus			1
the camera can capture the movement and calculate the speed of your eyes and action , or ( tell ) if they 're dilated or constricted			0
" @entity11 is still working on the prototypes for his @entity141 pupil scanner , but he hopes the product will be ready to go into the market in coming weeks			0
" i 'm looking at innovation as the challenge for me			0
if you look at the first world countries it 's satisfying for me to see that we are innovating on that level or even better			0
" and me coming from @entity151 , i did n't go to @entity152 , did n't have a rich dad who could buy me what i wanted -- i had to work for everything			0
i had to work and study			0
i used to pack fish when i was a student			0
and that motivated me to work harder , " he says			0
watch : @entity161 professor makes history			0
