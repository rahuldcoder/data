-- a long awaited night out at a @entity2 concert turned into a nightmare for a 33 - year - old @entity5 woman , whose heart was restarted after stopping for five minutes when she went into cardiac arrest			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity5 , was enjoying the concert 's opening act at the @entity12 in @entity13 with her best friend @entity14 on tuesday night when she had a seizure , according to information provided by @entity17			1
" she stopped breathing , her eyes rolled back in her head , and her body started twitching , " @entity14 said			1
" i was asking if she was ok , and she was n't responding			0
" @entity14 ran to the lobby to get help			0
it took @entity25 , an @entity26 supervisor with @entity29 's @entity28 program , one minute more to reach her			1
" the patient was unconscious with no heartbeat , " @entity25 said			0
using a portable automated external defibrillator , @entity25 and other paramedics spent more than five minutes until they were finally able to get @entity35 's heart beating again			1
she was then airlifted to @entity17 's emergency department , where doctors immediately used therapeutic hypothermia to cool @entity35 's body temperature to between 93 and 86 degrees -- below the normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees			1
even though her heart was working again , doctors wanted to slow circulation in order to prevent the death of brain cells -- and , therefore , brain damage -- caused by prolonged lack of oxygen			2
chilled water blankets were placed over @entity35 's body and head , and medical personnel then used a machine to lower her body temperature for 48 hours			1
" the patient received incredible care from the moment she experienced problems at the @entity12 , " said dr. @entity58 , medical director of @entity28			0
" it is only through a coordinated team effort that her successful outcome was possible			0
" after undergoing the two days of cooling therapy , @entity35 's body temperature was slowly restored to normal			1
she regained consciousness and neurologically continues to improve , according to her doctors in @entity13			0
on friday afternoon , she was in stable condition , the @entity5 hospital said			2
her cardiologist , dr. @entity73 , said that @entity35 is undergoing a battery of tests to determine why she suffered the heart attack			2
he told @entity0 it appears she has an enlarged heart -- " a genetic condition that , unfortunately , has no warning symptoms and often results in an emergency situation like @entity35 experienced			1
" next week , she will have surgery to put an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in her chest			0
the device sends electrical shocks that will automatically kick in if her heart starts beating irregularly and restore it to normal , in hopes of preventing another heart attack			2
@entity93 , an emergency medical technician and @entity17 's manager of event medicine , said the defibrillator saved the woman 's life			1
" without an aed , this patient would not have survived , " @entity93 said			0
" it restored her pulse			0
" while she 's thankful , it 's all a blur for @entity35			2
and she has n't gotten over not being able to see @entity2 strut and sing on stage			0
" i am so mad i missed the concert , " she said , according to a statement released by the hospital			0
@entity14 said friday that she 's grateful to have her friend back -- including after another scare thursday night , when " all of a sudden she stopped breathing , her eyes rolled back and all those machines started going off			1
" " they came in and shocked her , and she came right back , " said @entity14 .			0
