-- it was perhaps the most contentious moment during a @entity3 hearing filled with them			0
rep. @entity5 , @entity6 , appeared to strike a nerve wednesday when he pressed defense secretary @entity8 on why it was taking the @entity11 military so long to interview @entity13 sgt. @entity12 , the soldier being treated in @entity15 after the @entity16 released him may 31			1
@entity17 already had fielded lawmakers ' accusations that the @entity20 overstepped presidential authority and negotiated with terrorists to gain @entity12 's freedom			1
the defense chief started to explain that doctors treating @entity12 will decide when he is ready to talk , but @entity5 cut him off			1
why has n't he been returned to the @entity11 ? " @entity5 asked , noting that wounded soldiers from battle zones get flown back for treatment within days			1
" you 're trying to tell me that he 's being held at @entity32 , @entity15 , because of his medical condition ? " @entity17 responded , " congressman , i hope you 're not implying anything other than that , " as the two continued to talk over each other			1
" i do n't like the implication of the question , " @entity17 said at one point , and when @entity5 persisted about injured combat troops coming back to the @entity11 quickly , @entity17 raised his voice			1
" this is n't just about a physical situation , " he said			0
" this guy was held for almost five years in @entity47 knows what kind of conditions			0
... this is not just about can he get on his feet and walk and get to a plane			0
" @entity17 : @entity12 deal was ' imperfect ' but right decision the controversy it was that sort of day			1
the @entity12 swap at the end of last month has ignited a controversy in the partisan frenzy permeating @entity63 in an election year			1
@entity17 often appeared frustrated and even angry at times but stayed on - message after an opening statement that laid out the legal and ideological foundation for the agreement that the @entity16 claim as a victory			1
" @entity73 , every part of war , like prisoner exchanges , is not some abstraction or theoretical exercise , " @entity17 said early on , presenting a theme he repeated throughout the hearing			1
" the hard choices and options do n't fit neatly into clearly defined instructions in ' how to ' manuals			0
all of these decisions are part of the brutal , imperfect realities we all deal with in war			0
" ' we complied with the law ' in defending the deal approved by president @entity89 , @entity17 declared that " we complied with the law , and we did what we believed was in the best interests of our country , our military and sgt. @entity12			1
" " the president has constitutional responsibilities and constitutional authorities to protect @entity11 citizens and members of our armed forces			1
that 's what he did , " @entity17 said			1
" @entity11 does not leave its soldiers behind			1
we made the right decision , and we did it for the right reasons -- to bring home one of our own people			0
" @entity108 critics contended the cost was too high because it freed hardened terror suspects possibly to rejoin the fight against @entity11 interests , especially in return for a soldier accused by some in his unit of deserting his post			1
legislators from both parties also complained that the @entity89 administration failed to notify @entity121 ahead of time , as required by the @entity123 for transfers of @entity126 detainees			2
rep. @entity127 , @entity128 , the committee chairman , labeled as " misleading and at times blatantly false " @entity20 officials ' explanations at a classified briefing monday for making the exchange and not notifying @entity121 beforehand			2
' we could have done a better job ' @entity17 conceded the administration should have tried harder to let @entity121 know about what he called rapidly moving developments , saying he understood the frustration caused by the speed of the mission			1
" we could have done a better job of keeping you informed , " @entity17 said , noting that only a few hours elapsed between making the final arrangements with the @entity16 through the government of @entity146 , which mediated the agreement			2
" as the opportunity to obtain sgt. @entity12 's release became clearer , we grew increasingly concerned that any delay , or any leaks , could derail the deal and further endanger " him , @entity17 said			1
under the swap , the released @entity16 detainees were taken to @entity146 and will remain there for a year , with the @entity146 government saying it will keep an eye on them			0
@entity127 said he worried the newly freed @entity16 figures " still pose a threat to @entity11 and @entity162 alike " because " in a year , they will be free to return to @entity162			2
" other @entity108 legislators accused the administration of acting on its own to evade opposition to the deal in @entity121 as well as trying to hide a shift in @entity11 policy by negotiating with terrorists to secure @entity12 's release			1
they seized on @entity17 's confirmation that @entity12 at times was held by the @entity175 , a @entity16 wing designated a terrorist group in 2012			1
negotiating with terrorists ? @entity17 repeatedly said the on - off negotiations dating back to 2011 involved the broader @entity16 that formerly governed @entity162 , and that the government of @entity146 was an intermediary in the final talks in april and may			2
" we did n't negotiate with @entity175 , " @entity17 said , adding that @entity12 was moved around during his five years of captivity			1
that brought accusations of deceptive reasoning , with rep. @entity187 , @entity188 , sharply challenging @entity17			2
" how is it the @entity11 could 've been in negotiations with the @entity175 , a listed terrorist organization , and it not conflict with our policy that we do not negotiate with terrorists ? " @entity187 asked , to which @entity17 replied that " we dealt directly with the government of @entity146			1
" @entity187 shot back : " so now , the new policy of this administration is , ' we do n't negotiate with terrorists directly			0
' " the next legislator up , rep. @entity197 , @entity198 , criticized @entity187 for being " prosecutorial " and wondered aloud if his @entity108 colleague might be running for @entity20 @entity108 leader after rep. @entity203 's primary defeat			0
missing since 2009 @entity12 went missing on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity162 's @entity205 province , where he was deployed with the @entity206 , @entity207 , 4th @entity208 , @entity209			2
an @entity13 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance said he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official briefed on the report			0
the @entity13 has no definitive finding that @entity12 deserted because doing so would require knowing his intent -- something @entity13 officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity11 military official told @entity0			1
opinion : why we leave no man behind on wednesday , the @entity226 -- citing close friends of @entity12 's -- reported he had been discharged from the @entity227 before his @entity13 enlistment because of psychological issues			2
@entity12 served for about a month in the @entity227 before being released on an " uncharacterized " and " administrative " discharge , defense officials told @entity0			1
but @entity0 has been unable to confirm the reason for the discharge			0
the @entity226 reported @entity12 had told longtime friend @entity234 that he had faked the problems but that she doubted his explanation			2
" i said , ' you do n't fake a psychological discharge , you have to become unfit			0
' i told him that , " the @entity226 quoted her as saying			0
" the reality was it was n't okay			0
i saw it in the letters , the way the writing was changing , the anger			0
" some of those emotions are on display in excerpts of @entity12 's writings the @entity226 published			2
@entity251 said she received the writings -- contained in a journal and on a laptop computer -- in a package from @entity12 before he disappeared			2
she shared the writings to counter a growing perception of her friend as a deserter , the @entity226 reported			0
" these thoughts insist on trying to overwhelm my mind			0
... i 've spent a lot of my life thinking blackness was all i had in front of me , that it would be blackness to the very last instent ( sic )			0
i know this is not right			0
i know that there is light in this darkness , and that i can actuly ( sic ) reach it if i keep walking , keep moving to it , " @entity12 wrote , according to the @entity226			0
@entity12 is " continuing to improve every day " as he recovers at @entity280 in @entity15 , @entity277 spokesman col. @entity276 said this week , but the soldier has n't spoken with his family yet			0
when he is ready , @entity12 will be flown to the @entity281 in @entity282 , where he may be able to reunite with his parents			0
the @entity12 files : a custom magazine @entity0 's @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
