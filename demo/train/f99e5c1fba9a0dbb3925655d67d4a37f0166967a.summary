-- once again a new @entity1 has reported that @entity2 is the least religious state in the country , with only 22 % of the people willing to call themselves " very religious			1
" on the other side of the poll , there is @entity9 , where a whopping 61 % of citizens lay claim to that self - description			1
but what does it really mean to be " very religious " and not just spiritual ? i 've been living in @entity2 for much of my adult life , adding up to nearly four decades			1
and i 've been keenly interested in the question of religion , having written a biography of @entity20 and practiced @entity21 as best i can for much of my life			0
i 've also traveled in the @entity23 quite often , and understand where that 61 % comes from : not long ago i drove across @entity9 , and i could n't find a secular radio station on the dial			1
it was all preachers , all sounding alike			0
@entity29 , repent , repent			0
billboards everywhere shouted religious slogans			0
it seemed there was a church on every street corner in every town i passed through			0
so what 's going on here ? do @entity9 have a direct line to the divine ? do n't the majority of people of @entity2 also have an interest in religion or belief in @entity46 ? is this why @entity2 was the first state in the union to allow for civil unions ? and does secularism run rampant here ? on any given sunday , while i 'm sitting in church , many of my neighbors are out walking in the woods , skiing , or reading a book by the woodstove ( it 's what we do in @entity2 )			1
indeed traditional churches in @entity2 struggle to fill their pews , and one often sees churches being sold off to real estate developers , who convert them into apartments or places where secular business can take place under high ceilings that once filled with prayers			1
but it would be a mistake to assume the absence of the usual trappings of religion means that people in @entity2 -- or anywhere , really -- are n't pondering the big questions			2
religious affiliation does n't necessarily equate with spirituality in any deep way			0
indeed , when i step into my local co-operative food store in @entity2 , the bulletin board is crammed with listings for local meditation groups or yoga classes or panel discussions on " spirit and nature			2
" the community spirit is strong in this state , and the value of helping one 's neighbor is cherished here as much as anywhere			2
and these values include things like spending money on education , on good health care for all , and making sure that the land itself is responsibly used , with a keen awareness of environmental consequences			1
indeed , @entity2 was chosen the no. 1 greenest state in a recent poll			1
i 'm not sure that the religious fervor in @entity9 necessarily results in any of these things , for example , the state consistently ranks near the bottom in health care for low income people and environmental responsibility for some years i 've taught courses at @entity119 on poetry and spirituality , and students often say to me : " i 'm spiritual but not religious			1
" they are , nevertheless , on a quest			0
they like to ask big questions about @entity46 , about human fulfillment , about spiritual practice in the widest possible terms			2
with them i explore major spiritual texts , including the @entity131 , ancient @entity133 poems from @entity134 , @entity136 poetry , and the work of such great @entity21 poets as @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142			0
my sense is that there is no end of genuine interest in spiritual matters among students in my neck of @entity2			2
yet many of the traditional churches -- in @entity2 as elsewhere -- fail to address questions of spirituality in ways that interest those who might have a deep spiritual longing but ca n't profess a simple faith in @entity46 or subscribe to any dogma			1
@entity20 himself put forward the essential questions : what does it mean to live an ethical life ? what is this mysterious thing called " spirit " and how does it relate to questions about @entity46 ? how do we live , as people of faith , in communion with each other as well as @entity46 ? in so many ways , @entity20 was the ultimate seeker , hungry for the deepest kinds of experience			2
he looked for , and found , astonishing answers , inviting us to follow him in our quest			0
from what i can tell , @entity46 - hunger is alive and well in @entity2			1
but it tends to thrive outside the walls of traditional churches ( though it can be found there as well , as apparently 22 % of @entity2 will say )			0
i would refer the good pollsters at @entity1 back to the story of @entity20 , who when asked by pesky pharisees where the @entity189 could be found , said : " do n't say , look , it 's here or there ! for , behold , the kingdom of @entity46 is within you			1
" ( @entity196 17:21 ) that 's a challenging response , but it might not register as an appropriate answer on any @entity1			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity202 : @entity1 poll finds @entity2 least religious state . @entity9 is most religious
he says in @entity23 , religion all over radio , road signs , towns ; in @entity2 fewer go to church
but @entity2 ranks high on environment , health care . @entity9 ranks at bottom
@entity202 : @entity2 spiritual seekers , @entity46 - hungry : neighbor - helpers more than *churchgoers*
