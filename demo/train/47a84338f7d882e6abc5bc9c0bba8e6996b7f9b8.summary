@entity0 -- criminal charges will not be filed against the owner of a chimpanzee that mauled and blinded a @entity6 woman earlier this year , according to @entity6 state 's attorney @entity7			1
at a news conference monday , @entity7 explained that criminal prosecution against @entity10 , 77 , was not warranted because she was not aware of the risk her pet posed			1
on february 16 , @entity13 had called her friend @entity14 , 55 , for help in getting her pet chimpanzee @entity17 back inside her house after he used a key to escape			1
when @entity20 arrived at the @entity22 home of her friend , the chimp , who had been featured in tv commercials for @entity26 and @entity27 , jumped on her and began biting and mauling her , causing serious injuries to her face , neck and hands			0
police shot @entity17 to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds			0
@entity7 explained that the dangers of keeping a pet chimpanzee were never fully explained to @entity13 by the @entity6 @entity37			1
while the agency was aware that the chimpanzee was living with @entity13 , there is no evidence that they ever reached out to her to detail why the primate posed a threat to her and others in the community			2
furthermore , @entity13 had never had any problems with @entity17 in the past			0
although @entity17 had escaped once before in 2003 and " wreaked havoc " on the streets of @entity22 for a couple of hours , the chimp had never exhibited any violent behavior , especially towards @entity20 , with whom he had interacted with regularly			0
@entity20 , @entity7 stated , had specifically been called that day because @entity13 thought she could help in controlling the escaped chimpanzee			2
in the state of @entity6 , criminal prosecution would have to determine that @entity13 acted recklessly , disregarding the risk that @entity17 would attack and cause serious injuries to another person			1
because of the chimp 's familiarity with @entity20 , his previously placid behavior and the lack of contact by the @entity37 , @entity7 determined that @entity13 would not be held criminally responsible for the attack			2
" this does not in any way minimize the horror that we all feel with what occurred and with the horrendous injuries suffered , " he said			0
" our prayers go out to the family and to the victim			0
" in march , shortly after the attack , the family of @entity14 filed a lawsuit seeking $ 50 million in damages from the owner of the primate			1
the court papers , filed in @entity83 in @entity6 , alleged that the owner was liable for the attack , negligent and reckless in her ownership of a wild animal			1
following the attack , @entity20 was transported to the famed @entity88 , where the nation 's first face transplant was performed			2
in a written statement the @entity88 said that @entity20 had lost her nose , upper and lower lips , eyelids and both her hands in the attack , as well as the " bony structures in her mid-face			0
" the attack has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets			0
@entity6 attorney general @entity104 has stated that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals citizens are not allowed to own			1
when asked if there was anything to be learned from the attack , @entity7 said , " i think the public will have to draw their own lessons from what was a very tragic incident			0
