@entity0 , @entity1 -- fugitive @entity3 remains in the transit lounge of @entity6 's @entity0 as he attempts to negotiate his way to asylum -- one month after arriving from @entity9			1
the former @entity11 contractor , who leaked details about a @entity15 surveillance program , is requesting @entity6 take him in while he awaits safe passage to @entity17			1
while devoid of fresh air , @entity3 's temporary home does have an extensive selection of cafes , shopping outlets , business lounges and smoking rooms within its 400,000 - square - meter expanse of brightly lit space			1
for a small pack of international journalists who have been relentlessly following the @entity3 saga , including me for a short time , the airport has been home ( of a sort ) for the past few weeks			1
read more : the many mysteries of @entity3 's transit zone for those who may be passing through -- to find @entity3 or for even less thrilling reasons -- here are five ways to kill time in @entity0 , based on one reporter 's excruciating 24 hours in the lounge			1
@entity43 friday 's the ubiquitous all - american joint occupies prime real estate in @entity0 : an outlet right near the gates used for flights to @entity50 , where journalists initially suspected @entity3 might make his sprint for freedom			1
the walls are adorned with @entity55 and a sprinkling of @entity58 culture ; @entity59 and the @entity60 share corner space while a small but authoritative statue of astronaut @entity63 oversees the party			0
@entity65 and @entity66 rock the house while travelers bound for @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and other sunnier places trundle past			0
read more : @entity3 's future uncertain after retracted tweet while on @entity3 stakeout , i enjoyed fluffy @entity15 pancakes -- best 195 rubles you 'll ever spend for nap food			1
they were small and only gently warm , but , with a dose of mango jam , perfectly sweet			0
ideal with a strict black coffee			0
back at @entity43 's for lunch ( not much else to do ) , i selected the " @entity95 " smoothie , a refreshing mix of orange juice , pineapple , honey , nuts and peaches with cream and sorbet			1
i 'd have been happy to score one for @entity3 if he 'd only have showed himself			1
shopping for @entity97 dolls , vodka , crystals for those who have everything -- come to @entity0 for the one thing you do n't			1
browsing the long corridors between terminals @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 reveals a @entity110 crystal shop that sells a four - inch - high @entity112 doll , complete with pink bow and hearts			0
the crystal - encrusted kitty is a snip at € 500 euros ( duty free treasures can be bought in both euros and @entity6 rubles )			2

if you get sick of waiting for the next cherished @entity3 appearance , there 's an " igniting liquid " ( according to the label ) barrel of vodka for € 65 to keep you entertained			1
no explanation is offered for why this booze is more flammable than any other in @entity6			2
maybe it has something to do with your breath after loitering for a day in an airport			2
you might invest in another very @entity6 delight : matryoshka dolls			1
explore : @entity3 's asylum options row upon row are laid out in the glass cabinets of the more traditional shops			1
their pretty colors , gold scarves and luxurious lashes glow under bright lights , making them almost irresistible for the bored shopper			0
capsule snoozing the @entity152 is a sparse and efficient place to put one 's head for a few hours			2
the outlet where i bedded down for some @entity159 shuteye , near @entity106 , offers 46 rooms of utilitarian convenience in duck @entity162 and green			0
i checked into the only type of room left ; one without windows			0
the sound of vacuum cleaners reverberated through the walls			0
the shower sprayed water all over the floor when i turned it on			0
gallery : long history of spilling secrets for a passenger looking for simplicity at a transient time , however , the @entity152 does what it 's supposed to do			2
small white hand and body towels , snuggled on top of each pillow , completes the operation 's simple competence			2
but i did n't want to sleep long -- there might have been action on the @entity3 story			1
space - age lounging my airline loyalty program entitled me to three hours in the appropriately named orange - on - orange - on - silver @entity191 lounge , next to @entity193 the lounge 's sparse selection of inhabitants included a small dog which , as i invaded its personal space , erupted in high - pitched barks and attempted to bite my ankles			2
at this point i was sleep deprived , and it was a terrifying moment			0
the buffet offered little to ease my frazzled vegetarian nerves			0
read more : @entity207 on collecting intelligence there was a spread of pastry - heavy pies on offer in cabbage , meat , spinach , cheese , cottage cheese , mushroom , cherry and apple			0
i partook , instead , in the marzipan squares out of the fridge			0
they were slightly sloppier than expected and very sweet			0
i did n't go back for seconds			2
i tried my luck in the @entity227 , which looked rather more luxurious , but was turned away			0
it was empty , but i did n't have the right kind of ticket			0
at least they let me take a picture , which you can see above			0
@entity3 stakeout being on the @entity3 airport trail can be a frustrating experience			1
every man with three moles scattered up the left side of his face could be him ; but such men are rare			0
i returned to @entity242 without having spotted him			0
explore : notable leakers and whistleblowers @entity3 did emerge on july 13 , the first time he 'd been seen publicly since leaving @entity9 on june 23			1
he met with human rights activists and told them he was requesting temporary asylum from @entity6			2
a flurry of media activity met that appearance , but the steady troop of journalists through @entity0 has since slowed			1
finding journalists skulking around the airport is now almost as tricky as finding @entity3 himself			1
@entity3 will apparently be exiting the airport within days -- but in this global game of diplomatic cat and mouse , nothing can be assumed			1
at least @entity3 's got the airport 's top attractions to keep him entertained .			1

a month after arriving , @entity3 remains in @entity6 's @entity0 airport
he might be killing time at the airport 's *stellar* @entity43 friday 's
or shopping for @entity97 dolls
he sure is n't *hanging* out with journalists
