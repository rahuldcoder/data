-- the " @entity1 " is real			1
the mythical creature with the body of a serpent and face of a human folds himself into a tight coil for the gasping crowds , before slithering into his next impossible position			0
or at least , that 's how it seemed to circus manager @entity13 when he first saw the homeless boy dressed head - to - toe in a snake skin suit , performing on the streets of @entity18 , @entity19			1
a decade later , the mysterious " @entity1 " -- better known as 30 - year - old contortionist @entity26 -- is now set to perform on @entity21 's @entity20 , one of the star acts in @entity13 's spectacular circus show , " @entity25			1
" " i had been in the circus business since the 1980s and i 'd never seen something like @entity26 , " said @entity13			1
" it 's not so common to find a flexible man -- most contortionists are females from @entity33 or @entity34			0
" from street to stage while other professional contortionists spend years training in specialist schools from just five - years - old , @entity26 learned his trade while living on the streets aged 14			1
an orphan whose mother had died from aids and father from old age , @entity26 learned to bend his body into incredible positions from watching other performers busking			2
" i noticed i could do better than them , and i started training on my own , " said @entity26			2
" i was on the streets for six years with other boys and they all depended on me as their star show -- it was how we made money to survive			2
" the freakishly flexible teen became something of a legend on the streets of @entity18 , and when @entity13 came to the city looking for performers for his new circus troupe , he was quickly pointed in the direction of the " @entity1			1
" world class @entity13 , a @entity66 - born former acrobat with dreams of creating an all - @entity69 circus that would tour the world , auditioned more than 300 performers that day			2
" then somebody told me about this street performer , this ' @entity1 , ' so i went to see him			1
i was amazed , " said @entity13			0
" he had all the goods but his act still needed some polishing			0
i invited him to come back to @entity79 with me and train at my acrobatics school			0
" watch video : stars of @entity83 three years later " @entity84 " was born			2
boasting around 50 performers -- including acrobats , aerialists , clowns , and magicians -- the tribal - inspired show has toured across @entity91 , @entity92 , and come this december , @entity20			1
" the circus has changed the lives of many street boys , " said @entity26			1
" now they see a future as performers , they can travel the world , meet others artists , and earn decent pay			0
" snake charmer while all the elaborately dressed " @entity84 " performers display remarkable strength , stamina , and skill , it is the " @entity1 " who has carved a name for himself off the stage , regularly appearing in variety tv shows across @entity91 and the @entity113			1
sometimes performing with fellow contortionist @entity114 , the " @entity115 , " as they are known , bewitch audiences with their fantastically flexible maneuvers			2
indeed , from cramming himself inside a tiny glass box to leisurely bending his legs backwards over his head , @entity26 appears to be an otherworldly creature made entirely of rubber			0
" the audience is mesmerized -- some are shocked and some are afraid of what they see , " said @entity26			0
" but contortion is not dangerous if started in early childhood			0
today i usually train for around one - and - a - half hours a day			0
" @entity132 life despite the bright lights of the @entity134 , circus life can also be less - than glamorous , with the @entity84 performers usually living in four double - decker buses as they travel across the country			1
" we have around 10 people on each bus -- the top deck has the beds , and below is the kitchen , dining room , lounge , " said @entity13			0
" it 's more like a big family			0
" for @entity26 , the circus has also given him the chance to build a permanent home , recently buying a house in @entity79			1
it 's a long way from the streets of his youth			0
and it seems that much like the biblical @entity156 -- said to have risen four days after his death -- this @entity26 is also embarking on a remarkable new life .			2
