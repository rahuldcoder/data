@entity0 -- @entity3 's missile maneuvering has raised the question of how the @entity5 should respond , with some in @entity6 calling for shooting down anything that goes up			1
the issue gained new urgency on thursday with the disclosure that a @entity12 intelligence assessment suggested @entity3 may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear - tipped missile at its foes			1
it was the clearest acknowledgment to date by the @entity5 about potential advances in @entity3 's nuclear program , and came amid heightened concerns over recent threats by @entity21 of attacks against @entity23 and even @entity5 territory			1
at a background briefing on friday , a @entity26 member of @entity6 called the assessment of possible nuclear missile capability old news that first came out in 2011			1
however , the legislator said even a remote chance that a @entity3 missile could be carrying a nuclear warhead means the @entity5 should intercept it instead of waiting to find out			1
5 things we still do n't know about @entity3 's nukes hawkish sen. @entity39 , @entity40 , endorsed such a response earlier this week , saying that if @entity3 launched a missile , " we should take it out			1
" " it 's best to show them what some of our capabilities are , " @entity39 told @entity45 's @entity44 in remarks that his office confirmed as accurate			1
adm. @entity52 , commander of the @entity53 , told the @entity54 this week that the @entity5 has the capability to shoot down a @entity3 missile			2
while @entity5 officials do not specify , a combination of sea and land - based defense systems could be used to intercept a @entity3 missile			0
the @entity12 has announced plans to increase radar detection and land - based missile defense capabilities in @entity65 in coming months and years			0
under questioning by @entity39 , @entity52 advised against automatically intercepting any @entity3 missile , saying the @entity5 also had the ability to determine its trajectory and destination before making a decision to bring it down			1
@entity71 unacceptable , @entity72 says " we should have a sense of where it 's going to be aimed , " @entity52 said			0
" if we do n't , it does n't take long for us to determine where it 's going and where it 's going to land			0
" to @entity1 's @entity82 , an automatic response to shoot down any @entity3 missile would be " precisely the wrong " approach			1
" it would be a kind of silly tit - for - tat that would escalate in an entirely unpredictable manner , " @entity82 said this week			0
" i think it would be a kind of hot - headed response , when what we need right now are calm and steady nerves			0
" however , the congressional @entity26 at friday 's briefing said shooting down any @entity3 missile would send a strong message that the @entity5 had limits to its patience in dealing with @entity21 , and would also demonstrate the ability to counter-act such provocative and potentially catastrophic steps			1
a declassified portion of the @entity12 intelligence report concluded with " moderate confidence " that @entity3 had the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile , though the reliability was believed to be " low			2
" the @entity111 made clear friday that the government does n't believe @entity3 has the capability mentioned in the @entity12 document , with spokesman @entity115 telling reporters : " it is our assessment that @entity3 has not demonstrated the capability to deploy a nuclear - armed missile			1
" @entity115 's comment was similar to a statement by director of national intelligence @entity123 , who concurred with a @entity12 response that " it would be inaccurate to suggest that the @entity3 regime has fully developed and tested the kinds of nuclear weapons referenced in the passage " of the @entity133 assessment made public on thursday			2
@entity123 , the nation 's top intelligence official , also said the information from the @entity133 assessment was " not an @entity138 assessment			0
" opinion : why i fled @entity3 " moreover , @entity3 has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile , " @entity123 's statement concluded			1
the @entity26 member of @entity6 described @entity123 's statement as carefully worded and noted the final sentence indicated @entity3 was on its way to nuclear missile capability , even if it had yet to prove it could execute a successful launch			1
@entity115 offered a similar assessment friday , telling reporters that @entity3 had demonstrated nuclear capability and missile capability			1
" while it might sound simple , it is not surely simple to take the next step , " @entity115 said			0
" but make no mistake , the @entity3 have thus far demonstrated a desire to continue along this path			0
" secretary of state @entity72 said friday in @entity23 that despite the @entity133 assessment , it would be inaccurate to suggest @entity3 can launch a nuclear - armed missile			2
" obviously they have conducted a nuclear test , so there 's some kind of device , " @entity72 said in reference to three underground nuclear weapons tests by @entity3 since 2006			2
" but that is very different from miniaturization and delivery and from tested delivery and other things			0
" @entity3 has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the @entity5 and @entity23 in recent weeks , including the possibility of a nuclear strike			0
any missile launch by @entity3 would be a " huge mistake , " @entity72 added as a warning to the nation 's young leader			2
" if @entity185 decides to launch a missile , whether it 's across the @entity187 or in some other direction , he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community , his own obligations that he has accepted , and it will be a provocative and unwanted act that will raise people 's temperature with respect to this issue , " @entity72 said			0
the @entity5 was prepared to enter into talks with the @entity3 , but only if @entity21 was serious about negotiating the denuclearization of the @entity198 , according to @entity72			0
" @entity3 will not be accepted as a nuclear power , " he told a news conference with @entity23 foreign minister @entity200			0
@entity5 officials say @entity203 is growing more concerned about the @entity3 's provocations , but it also is closely watching @entity0 's latest military moves in the region			0
the @entity26 legislator at friday 's briefing said @entity203 has the ability to quickly impact @entity3 , which depends on @entity210 for aid to keep it solvent			1
in particular , @entity203 could cut off black market supplies of fuel and food across @entity3 's northern border , or shut down an oil pipeline between the countries , the legislator said			2
@entity1 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
