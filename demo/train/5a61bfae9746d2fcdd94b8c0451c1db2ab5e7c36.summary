@entity0 , @entity1 -- even though @entity6 was headed away from the site of the massive @entity9 oil spill wednesday , it was affecting containment and collection efforts on multiple fronts , @entity4 officials said			1
@entity6 , upgraded from a tropical storm late tuesday , was causing heavy seas throughout the @entity15 on wednesday			1
that had several major consequences : oil skimming ships had to return to shore , containment booms were thrown asunder and efforts to burn oil on the surface and break it down through dispersants were put on hold , along with efforts to position a third ship to collect oil at the spill site			1
" until the weather subsides , all we can do is have everything ready to attack and remove this oil once we have weather that 's more conducive , " said rear adm. @entity30 , who delivered a briefing for the @entity4 on wednesday			1
" we 've been held hostage for the last two days due to the prevailing weather , " he said			1
@entity6 -- the first hurricane of the @entity41 hurricane season -- was picking up speed and coming ashore in an unpopulated area of northeastern @entity44 , some 100 miles south of the @entity46 border			1
it is a category 2 storm with sustained winds of 100 mph			1
but even though the center of the storm is more than 600 miles from the spill site , it is producing high seas where the oil is located , according to @entity2 meteorologist @entity55			1
winds are 15 to 20 mph at the spill site , producing waves 6 to 8 feet high , he said			1
that poses a problem for the skimmers , @entity30 said			0
" when seas get over 3 feet high , the skimmers become ineffective			2
they wind up gathering water and not oil , " he said			2
more than 500 skimmers , from @entity1 to the @entity70 , have been forced to return to shore			2
also on hold : setting up another ship to contain oil at the spill site			2
@entity9 has two vessels , the @entity76 and the @entity77 , that are being used to contain oil			2
the company had hoped to bring in a third tuesday called the @entity80 , which would increase total containment capability to 53,000 barrels of oil per day			1
but crews need seas of less than 4 feet to make a connection to a coupler below the surface , according to @entity30			2
@entity9 now is aiming to complete the job by july 7 , he said			0
the @entity4 official said the seas also have disrupted containment booms , meant to limit the amount of oil reaching shore			1
he said officials will be making an aerial survey of the situation thursday			0
one thing that has not been affected -- @entity9 's effort to drill relief wells down to the area where oil is leaking			2
@entity102 would have to be very severe to affect that , according to @entity30 , and at this point , @entity9 said it is on track to reach the area in august			2
the storm also is having an impact on where the massive oil spill is flowing			0
previously , some oil had been reaching @entity110 in @entity70 , but the storm 's prevailing southeast winds have drawn it more toward the environmentally sensitive @entity113 and @entity114 sounds , off the coast of @entity113 and @entity1 , @entity30 said			1
@entity55 said that 's because the storm winds are moving counterclockwise in a huge arc			1
the strong winds are expected to blow for about three days , pushing the oil back to shore in the area where there already have been dramatic pictures of oil - drenched birds			1
the @entity4 briefing came on a day of change for the service branch , as adm. @entity129 , who has been overseeing the cleanup effort for the government , officially retired from the @entity4			0
@entity129 will continue as the national incident commander for the spill , but as a civilian			0
the move was announced by @entity137 secretary @entity136 , who said in a statement , " i commend adm. @entity129 for nearly 40 years of dedicated military service in the @entity4			0
throughout his career , our nation has turned to @entity129 for leadership at times of great crisis , and this is one of those times			0
" she continued , " @entity129 has provided excellent leadership as the national commander of our massive response to the largest environmental disaster in our nation 's history , and he will continue to leverage his decades of experience in civilian duty as the national incident commander for this spill			0
" adm. @entity158 was sworn in as @entity4 commandant on may 24 , when @entity129 left the @entity4 's top post as previously planned , to serve solely as national incident commander on the @entity15 spill			0
meanwhile , authorities also were busy preparing for future storms			0
planners with the @entity1 governor 's @entity137 and @entity166 this week created a hurricane evacuation plan with @entity9 , said the office 's director , @entity168			0
the plan , applicable for the entire hurricane season -- which ends november 30 -- calls for @entity9 's thousands of workers to leave the @entity1 coast at least 16 hours before officials begin evacuating residents			0
" we ca n't have @entity9 blocking our roadways with equipment and personnel , " said @entity168			0
it also designates 700 buses to be used only by disabled residents and calls for @entity9 to be back on the scene combating the spill within 72 hours after a hurricane , said @entity168			0
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels ( about 1.5 million gallons ) and 60,000 barrels ( about 2.5 million gallons ) of oil are gushing into the gulf every day			0
@entity2 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			1
