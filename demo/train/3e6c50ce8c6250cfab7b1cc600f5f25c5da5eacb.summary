-- if you 've been hearing the spin , the only reason to watch the inevitable train wreck of the upcoming debates would be to see just how inept both president @entity6 and @entity7 are at debating			1
and that spin is self - criticism			0
their own campaigns would have us believe that these two candidates ca n't piece together a complete sentence between the two of them			2
but i 'm here to tell you : it ai n't so			0
these are two of the better presidential debaters we 've witnessed , and i 'm anticipating excellent debates			2
if you have n't watched @entity6 , i can assure you that he more than held his own four years ago in the debates against @entity25			1
and if you have n't seen @entity7 , then take my word for it			1
he debated poorly in only two of his ( almost 20 ) debates this past year			0
his game is consistently solid			0
opinion : the mistakes candidates make in debates @entity7 's strengths : -- smooth			1
he 's a real smooth smoothie			1
he can answer questions and present his arguments and make it look like child 's play			1
after all , @entity7 bested @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity44 ( @entity45 and @entity46 , although @entity46 is no @entity47 of debating ) and the rest of the @entity50 candidates			1
if @entity7 could get through that minefield , he should be ready for @entity6			1
there were simply no debates where i thought @entity7 did n't have a firm grasp of the issue being debated at the time			1
do n't expect him falling prey to any gotcha moments			2
his first lines of answers and opinions on every subject were outstanding			0
-- backward - step - pivot - forward			0
@entity7 is masterful at this			1
he defends his position well ( backward - step ) , but then takes a potential weakness and turns it into a strength ( pivot - forward )			0
a great historical example demonstrating this technique was from @entity76			0
when people were worried about him becoming president at his advanced age , he famously stated in a debate against @entity81 that , " i will not make age an issue of this campaign			2
i am not going to exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience			2
" yeah , @entity76 understood the pivot - forward , and so does @entity7			1
opinion : when candidates said ' no ' to debates @entity6 's strengths : -- detachment			1
it 's one quality that made him seem so presidential in the debates four years back			2
@entity6 did n't take it personally when his policy ideas were attacked , and this helped build him convey strong character			1
he never let @entity25 rattle him			0
he came across , in every debate , as presidential			2
and poll after poll demonstrates the importance of poise in these debates			0
by the way , that includes when your opponent is speaking			0
remaining in control of verbal and nonverbal communication at all times was a big strength of @entity6 's four years ago			1
he exuded a presidential quality			0
opinion : how @entity6 can win the debate -- focus and crystallize			1
my old debate coach always taught me to crystallize and go back to the major premise			2
@entity6 was excellent in the @entity25 debates because he kept the focus on the economy			1
it might not be the economy this time , but @entity6 will find his issue to highlight and stick to it			1
whatever he lacked in the @entity25 debates from experience , he made up for in sound arguments			0
in all the debates from four years ago , neither @entity6 nor @entity25 ( nor @entity135 for that matter -- did i leave anyone out ? ) came across as unfit intellectually to become president			1
while i expect a good performance from both candidates , they 've not been mistake free in previous debates			1
@entity7 's weaknesses : -- smooth			1
he 's a real smooth smoothie			1
wait , what ? yeah , i said it was a strength , but it 's also one of his biggest flaws			2
ever heard the phrase " slick @entity7 ? " sometimes @entity7 comes across too polished			1
watch for him to do two things that drive me crazy			0
the first is his awkward smile he projects at the end of his answers ( or during his opponent 's speeches )			2
the second is when he says " thank you " at the end of his answers			0
he 'll be all heated , telling us why ( @entity6 in this case ) is a poor president , and then he 'll end with " thank you			1
" huh ? i thought you were angry until you blurted out " thank you			0
" to me , this demonstrates insincerity			0
he 's not answering the question , or debating his opponent			2
instead , he 's practicing his speeches			2
it 's professional and polished , yes			2
but that 's precisely what makes it impersonal and inappropriate for a debating format			2
i 'm all for good manners , but in this case , " thank you " is noticeably out of place			2
say it only at the end of the debate , after your closing argument			0
opinion : debate is @entity7 's chance to rally -- debating from behind in the polls			1
when trailing in the polls , it 's imperative to put your opponent on the defensive			0
@entity7 waited until @entity198 to do this in the @entity50 debates when he should have done it sooner			1
he was debating " not to lose , " but that 's only an effective strategy for the front - runner			0
-- extensions / second line of defense			0
this might have been @entity7 's greatest weakness			1
when pressed beyond his original answers on many topics , he simply could n't defend himself effectively			0
@entity212 : 10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate @entity6 's weaknesses : -- detachment			1
wait , what ? tricked you again			0
@entity6 sometimes appears dispassionate in debates			1
and with our economy still recovering , this lack of passion may distance him from the audience			0
-- slow , stuttering approach			0
i 'll admit that four years ago , i had n't heard @entity6 speak in any debates			1
and his speech in general was quite awkward -- containing so many pauses that i thought i was back in time , sitting on the divan listening to my grandfather slowly spin his yarns while the phonograph quietly played in the background			0
i did n't like his speaking style then , ( @entity6 's , not grandpa 's ) and i have n't changed my mind over the past four years			1
while these canyon - sized pauses might assist in conveying a thoughtful approach , they often give the opposite signal ... that he does n't know what he wants to say next			0
@entity6 's slow , stuttering speech does n't showcase well in debates			1
-- long - winded answers			0
@entity6 never mastered sound bites and clips			1
unfortunately , these debates have the tendency to be nothing but a series of sound bites , and that does n't play to the president 's hand			0
his extended answers sound like lectures			0
and nobody likes to be lectured , especially in a long - winded fashion			0
and oh , i almost forgot			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			2

@entity267 : campaigns are spinning but know that @entity7 , @entity6 are good debaters
on @entity7 's strengths : he 's smooth , knowledgeable , good at pivoting from questions
on @entity6 's strengths : stays cool , strong presence , good focus and reasoning
@entity267 : both have weaknesses that are flip sides of strengths ; expect a good debate
