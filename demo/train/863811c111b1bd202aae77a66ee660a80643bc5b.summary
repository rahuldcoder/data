@entity0 -- this would n't be @entity0 , folks , if there was n't a manufactured drama behind the drama that 's @entity7			1
so , two @entity1 producers decided to hold a cross-town race ( after all , they are a competitive bunch ) and see who could finish first			1
one took a plane : a $ 4 flight under a special @entity7 deal offered by @entity16			1
the other drove a car			1
the distance was 37.3 miles -- by car -- between the airports of @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity24 , @entity23			1
the obstacle to this @entity26 was potential gridlock from this weekend 's closure of @entity29 , due to an ongoing $ 1.2 billion expansion project			1
which would win , car or plane ? on a typical day , it would be a fair race , given @entity0 ' notoriously clogged highways			1
but on saturday , the " @entity7 " yielded to a " @entity37 " as motorists stayed home			1
that favored four wheels over two wings			2
the automobile beat the airplane by 47 minutes			2
in fact , the producer who drove the car was returning home by the time the plane arrived			1
" this went so smoothly , you ca n't believe it , " @entity50 reported from behind the wheel			2
his time : " 54 minutes in an absolute piece of cake			2
" and that included time lost on taking a wrong ramp , getting some water and messing with camera equipment , he said			0
" i would say that if traffic was like this all the time , people would be happy to take such adventures on a friday , " he added			0
while the car may have been king on this day , the airplane had the better party			1
" even though @entity50 won , " said producer @entity69 , " we are having more fun			0
there has been huge receptions at every gate			0
there 's a convivial atmosphere everywhere			0
" and , she added : " when 's the last time you got a gift bag " on a flight ? maybe one reason the plane lost was because it took the scenic route			2
" we flew over the 405 , and it was completely empty , " @entity69 said			0
she added how passengers on the plane even had a bird 's eye view of crews tearing down the @entity95 bridge over the 405			0
@entity95 is often featured in @entity97 films			0
the race began at 11:20 a.m. @entity99 , because that 's when @entity69 arrived at the @entity22 's @entity101 , one hour before flight time			1
the sold - out @entity103 ( that number is correct ) of @entity16 departed at 12:20 p.m. @entity99 , for a trip lasting 45 minutes gate - to-gate , to @entity106			1
but @entity50 enjoyed a fast start , reporting from his vehicle that @entity0 ' highways were a ghost town , relatively speaking			1
" i 'm getting on the ( @entity29 ) 5 freeway			0
i believe that most everyone has been intimidated by this @entity7 talk , " @entity50 said at about 11:30 a.m. " i do n't know how fair this test is going to be , " he added			1
shortly after noon , @entity50 was victorious , easily defeating the airplane			0
his time was 54 minutes , compared with one hour 41 minutes for @entity69			0
" while i may be losing this battle , i 'm having way more fun , " @entity69 said from the plane shortly before takeoff , describing refreshments and a cake with a depiction of a car - choked 405			2
on the plane , passengers found on their seats a gift bag that included cookies saying " 405 , " chips and water			0
as a longtime @entity132 , @entity50 waxed poetically about the 405 , a sentiment shared by many in town : " i avoid the 405 like poison oak , or wild - eyed people you randomly meet on story shoots who want you to pitch their product			0
" the 405 is a time bandit , a concrete thief that steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic			2
" but not today .			0
