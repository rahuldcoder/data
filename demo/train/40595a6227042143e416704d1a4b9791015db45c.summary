-- president @entity4 's foreign policy agenda may have " run out of steam " and he must now take risks and provide effective leadership , former @entity2 national security adviser @entity1 said friday			1
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity9 , @entity1 said @entity4 's foreign policy agenda is suffering from gridlock in @entity11			2
" i have the feeling that because of domestic problems , he has run out of steam , and i do n't know really how determined he is to resume what he started doing so well , which is to engage the world constructively , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 , who is now at the @entity20 in @entity11 , said the only way to break the stalemate is for @entity4 to take the lead			1
the president can show leadership , he said , by " persuasively going to the country directly , mobilizing the support , taking on some difficult foreign challenge , and prevailing			0
" @entity1 cited @entity29 as an example of key challenges @entity4 ought to tackle			1
@entity4 should not " abandon it prematurely , " he said , noting the complexities of the internal @entity29 situation could give the @entity2 " room for maneuver , and perhaps some basis for expecting an eventual partial accommodation			1
" @entity1 also cited the @entity41 - @entity40 conflict as a key challenge because it " revolutionizes , radicalizes the @entity43 , and maximizes the number of enemies the @entity2 has			1
" asked how he would grade the @entity4 administration 's performance on @entity29 and the @entity43 , he said , " well , rhetorically , a ; in terms of performance , @entity49 , b - minus			1
" despite the @entity2 ' foreign policy problems , @entity1 said , the nation has the resources to deal with new global security threats in cyberspace , outer space and on the high seas			1
@entity1 also commented on the newly published 2010 @entity59 , a legislatively mandated review of the @entity2 @entity62 strategy and priorities			2
the review is meant " to assess the threats and challenges that the nation faces , " and to " rebalance the department 's strategies , capabilities and forces to address today 's conflicts and tomorrow 's threats , " according to the @entity62			0
@entity1 warned even though the @entity2 has highly sophisticated technology , it also has to be effective in global diplomacy , adding , " we have neglected that in the course of the last decade			2
" " i think we have to redefine the nature of the enemy , " @entity1 said , " the global security context in which we find ourselves is now fundamentally different			0
" @entity1 , national security adviser during the @entity84 administration between 1977 and 1981 , noted how the new threats differ from those of the @entity87			1
" when i was in the @entity89 , the threat was concentrated and very lethal , " he said			0
" you know , the @entity92 , in case of a central war with the @entity2 , could kill roughly 80 million @entity2 in six hours			0
" today , @entity1 said , the @entity2 has " a lot of threats , ranging from terrorists to rogue states to unpredictable events			2
and that makes the defense issue more complex , even though it is somewhat rather less lethal			0
" he cited the example of cyberattacks			0
" are these hackers , for example , from @entity106 working for the @entity106 government or are they working for some private business ? what are their motives ? " he said it is vital for the @entity2 to have the capability not only to stop hacking , but to retaliate as well .			0
