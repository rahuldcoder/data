when @entity1 reflects on mistakes from past jobs , he cringes to think about the role he played in printing 4 million copies of a well - known @entity7 magazine with the wrong date on the cover			1
it was the early 1980s and @entity1 was working as an offset stripper , who performs platemaking and stripping for presses			1
he said he could only wait in horror as his little mistake was distributed across the country			1
the memory is burned into his brain			1
it resurfaced earlier this month when he learned of the nurse in the @entity21 who put through a prank call from two @entity24 djs to the ward where prince @entity27 's wife , @entity26 , @entity26 , was being treated for acute morning sickness			1
who was nurse @entity30 ? while the circumstances of the nurse 's death remain unclear , the incident prompted @entity1 and many other @entity37 readers to share stories of dealing with stressful situations on the job , making mistakes and moving on			1
mistakes are an opportunity to see how you can do something differently , said commenter @entity45 , a software engineer from @entity47 who has had " code blow up in my face several times , sometimes with disastrous results , " he said			1
" in almost every case i have had to take the action of documenting every little thing that went wrong , why it went wrong and how this was never going to happen again			1
" the commenter , who asked not to have his real name used , said he once was mortified to find that he had somehow stripped last names from everyone in a database			1
his co-workers made up a song about him , to the tune of " @entity64 , " asking " who can take the last name , and throw it all away ? " after his initial panicked reaction , he calmed down and came up with ways to rectify the situation			1
" i spent two days calling those 500 people , getting their last names , " he said			2
" management figured that was punishment enough			2
" the commenter said his situation pales in comparison to the stress nurses and hospital workers deal with daily , where lives are at stake			2
" hospitals are by their nature a stressful place : you have births , sickness and death , all under one roof , " he said			2
" caregivers are bombarded by every type of emotion on a daily basis			2
" the incident caused him to fear that he would lose his job			2
but talking to co-workers proved to be helpful , he said			2
" in most of those cases , my co-workers were supportive , and when i needed more support , i just unloaded emotionally on my wife of 33 years			2
" seeking support from others can be helpful , especially in cases where you think you might be in danger of losing your job , said @entity109 , associate professor of management at @entity111			2
they may help you see things differently			1
@entity109 said people of all occupations often place their self worth in their jobs because they see them as much more than a task			0
" their heart and soul is in their job , so their identity is wrapped in it , which is great , but when your job is threatened or you make a mistake , that makes it all the more harder			1
" it helps to get a bit of perspective on the situation by disengaging and " stepping away from the workplace to focus on everything else that you have , " she said			0
" i think it makes the support aspect all the more important			0
you really need to focus on other parts of your life			0
" employers also benefit from keeping their employees happy , said @entity109 , who researches the effects of incivility in the workplace			0
most people are focused on the outward display of anger and far less aware of the devastating effects of being afraid or sad about one 's status in the organization , she said			0
these latter two emotions are the ones that are more likely to cause people to leave their jobs , she said			0
since his first public gaffe , @entity1 said he has learned to handle workplace stress by maintaining an emotional detachment from the task at hand while making decisions			1
" by using logic , and following the ( standard operating procedures ) , everything is no longer personal , just business			0
i then go home and engage my hobbies			0
" @entity1 had no choice but to try to do better on the next issue of the magazine			0
he slowed down and went over his work again carefully			0
he made a checklist and had another technician perform a quality control inspection before starting the four - hour process of printing the covers			0
" it only added about 15 minutes to the job , but they were a well - spent 15 minutes , " he said			0
corporate recruiter @entity184 said the recession can increase people 's concerns about doing well at work			0
he advised that if you do make a mistake , you should have a plan to correct it			1
if the mistake is big , get help			1
" it 's always recommended that if something happens like that , and it 's too big to handle , that 's when you should bring in your boss , " @entity184 said			0
some people may be tempted to say nothing , but that can be dangerous , he added			0
" if you tell the truth , you do n't have to worry about what truth you 've told , " @entity184 said			0
