-- investors of @entity3 assets have had their first real chance to assess the situation in @entity6 and they did n't like what they saw			1
the two major indices in @entity9 , the @entity10 and the @entity11 , slumped more than 8 % on opening monday and worsened as they day carried on			0
investors do not like uncertainty and they were delivered more than their fair share over the weekend			0
with the ruble hitting a record low of about 37 to the dollar , central bank governor @entity15 surprised the market by pushing interest rates to 7 % to buffer a run on the currency			1
the reality is quite simple : @entity3 's economy has seen a dramatic slowdown for the past year			1
after growing 3.4 % in 2012 , it came in at about a third of that level last year with an expansion of just 1.3 %			0
the forecast of 2.5 % growth in 2014 , many suggest , looks ambitious with incursions into @entity6 part of the equation			1
while this is being positioned domestically in @entity3 as a move by president @entity39 on behalf of @entity3 in the east of @entity6 , the military action probably will not sit well with those in the middle class who took to the streets over the past year			1
they have been frustrated by slow growth , a lack of transparency within government , and a lack of oil and gas revenues trickling down to those with higher aspirations and expectations			0
during the height of the global financial crisis , @entity39 , whether at a @entity57 or @entity56 , took the opportunity to criticize western powers for not being vigilant enough with their commercial bankers -- whether on @entity64 or within the @entity65			0
he proudly predicted @entity3 would continue to grow at 4 % with ample reserves of a half trillion dollars saved for a rainy day			1
that day may have arrived			0
strategists i have interviewed complain that @entity39 relied on one asset -- energy -- for far too long			0
at the @entity73 in @entity74 late last year , the energy minister @entity72 spelled out plans for @entity3 reserves to expand handsomely over the coming years			1
gas pipelines , like the @entity78 , are being constructed to bypass @entity6 and provide @entity79 with ample supplies for the next generation			2
@entity3 also has inked strategic energy partnerships with @entity83 and @entity74			2
but as the world is finding out , one can not live on energy alone with an economy of 140 million people			0
government ministers i have spoken with admit they are well behind the curve when it comes to infrastructure investment			0
another worrying sign for the economy is that it is expanding only modestly -- despite the projected $ 50 billion that was spent on the @entity96 and projects earmarked for the 2018 @entity98			1
so where does dispute over @entity6 lead us ? there are a number of tricky questions that need to be answered			1
executives at @entity106 , @entity3 's state - run gas giant , have declared that @entity6 is one and a half billion dollars in arrears on payments and that discounts given to the previous , @entity112 government expire at the end of the month			1
it is not clear whether @entity3 will turn off the taps as it has done twice before			2
@entity6 is carrying an unmanageable amount of debt -- nearly $ 30 billion comes due by the end of 2015 , about half of that this year			2
the @entity121 is sending a team over for an initial consultation this week , but until the political situation is sorted out before elections , it is not clear whether the fund will step in			0
there is a co-dependency between @entity3 and @entity79			2
while major @entity131 members like @entity132 and @entity133 have reduced their reliance on @entity3 gas , about a quarter of all supplies still comes from pipelines filled by @entity9			2
about a third of @entity3 's daily oil output of nearly ten million barrels a day goes to @entity79 as well			1
finally , the @entity140 may be suffering from military fatigue after years in @entity142 and @entity143 and the @entity131 from expansion fatigue			0
with 28 members after of an era of enlargement and sluggish growth of just a 0.5 % projected for this year , @entity145 can ill afford to jump into a political mess on its eastern flank			0
