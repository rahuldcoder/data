it could be the wedding video to end all wedding videos			2
there are not many newlyweds who can say they received a call from the @entity5 on their wedding day			1
granted , the president was calling to apologize after the bride and groom -- @entity10 and @entity11 -- were forced to scramble to find an alternate location for their wedding , once they were informed by the @entity16 at @entity17 that @entity18 wanted to play through the site of their nuptials			1
nobody told us , " @entity18 told the couple in a video provided to @entity28 by the bride 's family			1

" i hope the wedding went ok anyway , " he continued			0

" i shot an 84			0
if i had skipped the 16th hole , i would have shot a 79 , " @entity18 replied			1
the conversation then turned to what sounded like an episode of the presidential dating game			0
" how long you been going out ? " @entity18 asked			2
the couple proceeded to tell @entity18 they have been dating since 2011			1
the military couple , both captains , attended @entity70 , before moving to @entity71 where they met			0
