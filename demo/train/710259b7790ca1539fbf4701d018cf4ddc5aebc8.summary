@entity0 -- there are political upstarts , rebels with and without a cause , and then there 's @entity7			1
the first - term @entity9 senator from @entity10 has achieved the rare notoriety of having almost everyone in @entity0 mad at him , at least for now			1
his legislative maneuverings led to last year 's 16 - day government shutdown , and he almost single - handedly scuttled this week 's congressional approval of a year - long debt ceiling extension that denies fiscal conservatives a key negotiating tool until after the november elections			0
@entity20 dislike @entity7 for his right - wing social and economic policies such as vehement opposition to gay marriage and president @entity25 's signature health care reforms			2
@entity7 's @entity9 colleagues , especially those in the @entity28 , are angry because he forces them to choose between conservative purity and political pragmatism , a particularly tough spot in an election year			1
to @entity7 , a tea - party favorite who arrived in @entity0 just over a year ago , it 's all about telling the truth -- as he sees it			1
election - year logic explains @entity9 dysfunction cruz : politicians are lying to the people @entity0 politicians -- including fellow @entity9 -- do n't want to be honest with @entity44 about their unwillingness to tackle tough issues like the rising federal debt , @entity7 said thursday in an interview with conservative talk radio host @entity49			1
" people do n't like to be lied to , " he said to explain historically low approval ratings for @entity52 , adding that forcing @entity9 politicians to tell the truth " makes their head explode			1
" others , including fellow legislators , say @entity7 puts his personal agenda of galvanizing a right - wing political movement ahead of what 's best for his party as a whole as it tries to reclaim control of the @entity28 and retain its @entity67 majority in november			1
@entity68 , a @entity9 strategist and @entity1 political commentator , said @entity7 's tactics seek to position him as a conservative champion on social issues as well as economic issues			1
@entity68 cited a new proposal by @entity7 intended to strip the federal government 's power to legalize gay marriage by shifting that issue to state control			0
" social conservatives are looking for a voice inside the legislative process on ( the gay marriage ) debate and @entity7 is now stepping up , " @entity68 said			2
" and i think @entity7 sees this as an opportunity to become a social conservative champion because i think he has put together a pretty strong profile as an economic conservative champion in other debates			1
" however , such right - wing positions increasingly differ from the @entity44 mainstream , which can make @entity7 a liability for the @entity9 , according to @entity68			1
" if he 's positioning himself as the face of the party , and he 's moving against public tide and public sentiment , it makes republicans look once again like they are out of step with the @entity44 people , " @entity68 said , adding : " that 's what 's happening to @entity7			1
" panel : @entity7 creating headaches for @entity108 , @entity9 new kid on the block in less than 14 months , @entity7 has quarreled publicly with @entity20 senators , staged a 21 - hour filibuster against the health reforms known as @entity114 -- at one point reading the dr. @entity117 classic " @entity118 " -- and enraged @entity9 leaders by pushing strategies that backfired on the party			1
last october , @entity7 's insistence on linking provisions dismantling @entity114 to needed government spending authority caused the government shutdown			0
it ended with republicans getting nothing but blame for what most @entity44 considered a needless political crisis			0
wary of a similar debacle , @entity9 leaders shifted from a two - year strategy of wringing concessions out of the need to raise the federal borrowing limit			0
after previously saying they would target the debt ceiling deadline in late february for more deficit - reduction demands , they decided against creating another example of @entity0 gridlock and dysfunction			0
this week , @entity67 @entity9 failed to agree on attaching various provisions sought by conservatives to a debt - ceiling plan that allows the government to borrow what it needs through march of 2015			0
house speaker @entity150 , a past proponent of forcing concessions over the issue , gave up and pushed through a " clean " proposal that passed with support from 199 @entity20 and only 28 @entity9			2
@entity9 leaders in @entity28 then sought a politically expedient strategy for the measure disliked by the party 's conservative base			1
they urged their caucus to let it come up without objection so @entity9 could simply vote " no " while @entity20 passed it			0
filibuster politics @entity7 had other ideas			0
he tried to filibuster the measure , which forced a 60 - vote majority in order for it to proceed			0
that meant at least five @entity9 had to join the 55 - seat @entity20 caucus to prevent a showdown that could roil financial markets over the possibility of a @entity44 default in coming weeks			0
with the vote held open for far longer than usual , @entity28 @entity9 leader @entity174 of @entity175 and top deputy @entity176 of @entity10 eventually provided the final two @entity9 votes needed to overcome the @entity7 filibuster bid			1
other @entity9 senators then changed their votes to provide political cover for @entity108 and @entity176 , and all 12 @entity9 senators who helped @entity20 stave off the filibuster then opposed the debt ceiling plan on the final vote			2
needing only a simple majority for final approval , it passed with purely @entity20 support			0
@entity7 railed against that kind of politicking in the interview thursday with @entity49 , accusing fellow @entity9 of being dishonest			1
" the single thing that @entity9 politicians hate and fear the most ... is when they 're forced to tell the truth			1
it makes their head explode , " he said , calling the debt - ceiling vote " the perfect example			1
" his @entity9 colleagues , which he called establishment republicans , wanted " a perfect show vote " in which they opposed the debt ceiling plan without being held accountable for enabling @entity20 to pass it by helping them overcome the filibuster bid , @entity7 said			1
" they wanted to be able to tell what they view as their foolish gullible constituents back home they did n't do it , and they 're mad because by ( my ) refusing to consent to that , they had to come out in the open and admit to that , " he said			0
@entity219 criticism it was unusually harsh and direct criticism of party colleagues , the opposite of the political mantra often cited by @entity9 icon @entity224 that " thou shalt not speak ill of another @entity9			2
" @entity9 anger at @entity7 for the debt - ceiling maneuver had been obvious but muted			2
sen. @entity228 of @entity229 said his colleagues thought " this was n't a good strategy in light of the fact that the @entity67 showed it did n't have the ability to pass a debt ceiling with @entity9 votes			2
" @entity228 and other veteran @entity9 legislators , including @entity108 and @entity176 , face primary challengers from the right this year , and the debt - ceiling vote provided ammunition for opponents to attack their conservative credentials			0
for @entity7 , bucking what he calls the @entity0 establishment , including @entity9 , is all that matters			2
" if we wait on the entrenched politicians in @entity0 to make the case to stand up , hell will freeze over before that happens , " he told @entity49			0
" this is nothing new			0
that 's true of entrenched power			0
it 's always been true of @entity0			0
" about his @entity9 detractors , @entity7 said that " every one of those senators who 's angry , when they go back home , they tell their constituents they 're doing everything they can to stop ( the rising debt ceiling ) , but they do n't actually want to do what they 're saying			2
" such a public rift with his party can hurt @entity9 and @entity7 , said @entity266 , a @entity1 political commentator who hosts " @entity267			1
" " @entity7 seems to be uncontrollable by the @entity9 , " @entity266 noted , adding that polls show @entity7 " moving in the wrong direction " among potential @entity9 presidential contenders in 2016			2
" people are dissatisfied with folk like @entity7 , who do n't seem viable anymore because they 're not willing to play ball			0
" @entity68 , the @entity9 strategist , conceded that with @entity7 's ability to " drive a lot of headlines and get a lot of attention , " @entity9 leaders will continue to see him " as a challenge			1
" @entity1 's @entity283 contributed to this report .			0
