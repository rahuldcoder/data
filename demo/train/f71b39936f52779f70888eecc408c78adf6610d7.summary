-- " usually when i mention suspended animation people will flash me the @entity3 sign and laugh , " says scientist @entity0			1
but he 's not referring to the plot of a " @entity7 " episode			0
@entity0 is completely serious about using lessons he 's learned from putting some organisms into suspended animation to help people survive medical trauma			1
he spoke at the @entity13 conference in @entity14 , @entity15 , in february			0
the winner of a @entity18 genius fellowship in 2007 , @entity0 described the thought process that led him and fellow researchers to explore ways to lower animals ' metabolism to the point where they showed no signs of life -- and yet were not dead			1
more remarkably , they were able to restore the animals to normal life , with no apparent damage			2
read more about @entity0 on @entity32 the web site of @entity0 's laboratory at the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , describes the research this way : " we use the term suspended animation to refer to a state where all observable life processes ( using high resolution light microscopy ) are stopped : the animals do not move nor breathe and the heart does not beat			1
we have found that we are able to put a number of animals ( yeast , nematodes , drosophila , frogs and zebrafish ) into a state of suspended animation for up to 24 hours through one basic technique : reducing the concentration of oxygen			1
" visit @entity0 's laboratory @entity0 is investigating the use of small amounts of hydrogen sulfide , a gas that is toxic in larger quantities , to lower metabolism			2
in his talk , he imagined that " in the not too distant future , an emt might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide , or some related compound , to a person suffering severe injuries , and that person might de-animate a bit ... their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home			0
" that will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need			0
and then , after they get that care ... they 'll wake up			0
a miracle ? we hope not , or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common			0

@entity0 is a scientist who is stu*dying* ways to put life into suspended animation
in a @entity32 , he describes how his lab has put some organisms into a suspended state
the animals are revived and appear to suffer no lasting damage , he says
such techniques may one *day* keep people from *dying* so they can get *urgent* care , he says
