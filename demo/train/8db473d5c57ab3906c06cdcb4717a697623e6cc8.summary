my @entity0 is the bravest man i 've ever known			1
the first time i remember thinking this was around the age of 4 when i found myself suddenly trapped in the middle of a horrific dog fight			2
my @entity0 charged right into the center of the gnashing teeth , grabbed me and lifted me to safety on the hood of a nearby car			1
when you 're 4 , that 's a heroic act worthy of some kind of medal			2
i think i probably drew him a picture of one			0
it was only later that i learned my @entity0 did n't need a picture			1
he had the real thing			0
i was reminded of this as i watched , with quite a bit of emotion , the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of @entity27 on friday			1
remember the heroes , one of the commentators said			0
remember them , for there are so few left			0
and soon they will all be gone			0
@entity34 volunteered for the @entity35 at 19 and landed in @entity36 three months after d - day with the @entity38 , known as the @entity39			1
though he had the skills of a certified sharpshooter , he had decided to become a medic and wore a helmet with a red cross on it			0
shortly after arrival in @entity36 , his unit was ushered to the front lines			1
as some members of his group were attempting to clear a large enemy minefield , one misstep set off an explosion that left several lying , badly injured , in the middle of the deadly devices			1
the sergeant asked for volunteers to go and rescue them			2
my @entity0 raised his hand			1
he 's never given us a detailed play - by - play of how he and a couple of his fellow soldiers maneuvered around those mines and picked up those men and got them safely out of there			1
but it 's all spelled out on the certificate that accompanied his @entity72 , the third highest @entity75 military decoration for valor			1
the official description of it notes that the @entity72 is awarded for " gallantry in action			1
" it describes my @entity0 's life to a @entity83 seventy years ago this fall , as the 104th moved toward @entity85 , my @entity0 was witness to all the atrocities of war			1
but nothing like what he saw once he got there in the spring of 1945			0
our generation knows the holocaust only from pictures and film			0
but my @entity0 and his company experienced it firsthand			1
they were the liberators of the @entity100 concentration camp at @entity101			1
it 's not the most famous , but it 's certainly among the most ghastly			0
here 's a description from the website @entity105 : " @entity101 was liberated by the 104th @entity75 @entity38 on april 12th , 1945			0
when the first @entity107 's arrived in the camp , they discovered a gruesome scene			2
more than 3,000 corpses were scattered , helter - skelter on the grounds			2
in several hangars there were no survivors and in others they found only 2 or 3 living inmates lying amongst dozens of corpses			0
the situation was so calamitous that the medic unit of the @entity38 had to request urgent medical reinforcements and supplies			0
more than 400 @entity85 civilians living in the direct vicinity of the camp were forced by the @entity107 's to evacuate the corpses			2
the medic units of the @entity38 did the best they could to save as many prisoners as possible , but even with the excellent care they received , numerous inmates died in the hours and days following the liberation of the camps			0
" my @entity0 never talked much about this experience when we were younger , though we 've learned more about it as my children and my sisters ' children have done school projects and interviewed their grandfather about @entity140 , as he spared us , he also protected them from the most horrific details			1
he did do an interview once where he described some of what he saw and felt on that terrible day			2
two things from it jumped out at me then and stick with me now			0
first , his recollection of the " smell of death " all around him			0
and second , his still hearing in his head the voices of the local @entity85 guards and residents , sickly pleading for mercy with their constant cries of " @entity156 ! nicht wissen ! " -- " we did n't know ! " " they knew , " my @entity0 said			1
" my father turned 91 in january			0
he tends to doze a lot , but he can still be the funniest guy in the room when he wants to be			0
his grandchildren and pretty much everyone else refer to him affectionately as " @entity165			0
" in the wake of the @entity27 celebrations and in advance of this sunday 's festivities for fathers everywhere , i 'd like to call him " hero			1
opinion : @entity175 's ' soul - racking ' @entity27 decision			2

@entity177 : @entity0 does n't talk much about aspects of his @entity180 experience
@entity34 volunteered for the @entity35 , won a @entity72 for gallantry in @entity36
he helped rescue soldiers from a minefield and liberate a concentration camp
@entity177 : in light of d - day anniversary and @entity172 , i call him a hero
