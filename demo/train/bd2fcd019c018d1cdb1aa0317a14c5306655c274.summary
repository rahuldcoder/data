-- @entity2 sailors called it the @entity4			1
@entity6 's bushmen speak of the land @entity8 made in anger			1
from the air , the bleak shoreline of the @entity11 looks wonderful -- a deep green sea , fringed with surf , breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes			1
from land , it 's a different story			1
the @entity19 rushes in , urgent and strong , hurtling the chilling @entity20 into the fierce heat of the @entity22			2
whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region 's frightening name			1
humans have suffered , too -- the remains of ships wrecked on the hidden rocks offshore rust and crumble beside the animal bones			1
survivors did n't last long in this harsh environment			2
punishing trip ? why , then , visit this brutal - sounding place ? because its forbidding nature has left @entity6 's @entity11 one of the most pristine shorelines in the world			1
it may be bleak , but it 's beautiful			1
the territory extends from just north of the city of @entity49 to the @entity51 border in northwest @entity6 , taking in 500 kilometers of shoreline and 2 million hectares of dunes and gravel plains			1
it forms a national park , divided by rivers			2
more : 9 not - in - the - guidebook @entity60 safari tips the southern section runs between the @entity63 and @entity64 , the north between the @entity66 and @entity67			1
independent travelers can apply for permits for day trips but only to the south -- and it 's the northern extremes , the @entity74 , that most people want to see			1
visitors to the latter part of the park are restricted to around 800 a year to preserve the fragile environment			1
exclusive and expensive the only way to reach the north is to join a fly - in safari -- an exclusive , if expensive , experience			1
a typical four - day trip costs around $ 6,000 per person			2
after flying to an inland camp , my guide , @entity90 , and i reach the sea following a 200 - kilometer drive through dune country			2
we climb out of the @entity95 into a huge animal graveyard : seal skulls jumbled with turtles ' rib cages and the colossal , bleached vertebrae of whales			2
the wind shunts me from one set of remains to the next			2
one ghoulish question suggests itself : " are there human skeletons , too ? " " of course ! " @entity90 shouts , his voice almost lost in the wind			1
" it 's the shore of a thousand shipwrecks			1
" wreck - spotting one of the coast 's best - known wrecks is a @entity116 liner , the @entity117 , beached by her master after hitting a reef ( some say a u-boat ) in the 1940s			1
a tug , the sir @entity125 , went to her aid but it sank , too			0
an arch of whale bones marks the grave of the two crewmen who led the rescue attempt , trying in vain to secure a line from the ship to the shore			0
every now and then the wreck of their tug can be seen above the waves			0

their noise is deafening , their smell overwhelming , but their antics draw you in			0
the surf is full of writhing bodies			0
at the water 's edge , the occasional rock twitches , rolls over and throws itself into the sea			1
we follow the coastline for miles			0
ours are the only tire marks , soon to be erased by the sand			0
ghost crabs scuttle into the waves ; terns swoop over the surf ; a jackal flops , seemingly exhausted , onto the shore			0
little game when it comes to watching wildlife , the @entity11 is n't about big game			1
guides focus on small mammals , birds and insects and the stories of how they survive			1
with ocean fogs the only moisture supply , creatures conserve what they can			0
black - backed jackals lick humidity from stones			0
desert beetles channel droplets along their backs and into their mouths			0
@entity192 - tokkie beetles pair up , then climb on top of one another , taking it in turns to provide shade			0
without compass or @entity199 , @entity90 drives us on a convoluted route back into the desert			0
he suggests i look out the window for " unexpected stones " -- indicators to turn left or right or double back a touch			1
they 're meant to keep vehicles on course and not flatten tracts of this delicate ecosystem			0
hear the dunes roar we arrive at the legendary " roaring " dunes , climb to the top and slide down on our butts			0
i know the fearsome rumble comes from air trapped between grains of sand , but i still glance up convinced there are low - flying jets overhead			0
the next couple of days are spent hiking through gorges , tracking desert - adapted elephants and exploring a wilderness that never seems to end			0
what looks like wasteland to me is , to the @entity231 people , home			2
more : @entity233 proposes " @entity234 in @entity60 " they 're the last of @entity6 's nomadic pastoralists : they grow nothing and eat only meat			1
the women braid their hair and scrub their bodies with ocher to keep clean			0
their skin gleams like polished copper in the sun. one morning , we visit their camp			2
the trip is laid on for tourists , but when it 's over we head to the home of one of the guides on the tour			2
his mother offers me a necklace of porcupine quills as young girls sit and smile			0
eventually they overcome their shyness and get up to sing			0
as i leave , i notice a small boy , eyeing me from the top of a dune			2
@entity267 to impress , he somersaults over the top and falls flat on his face in the sand			0
he gets up , shakes himself down and laughs			0
even in this tough environment , the survivors find plenty of reasons to smile			0
