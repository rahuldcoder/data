when we think of terminal cancer patients , we do n't imagine someone like @entity3			1
she is 29 years old			2
in photos from her wedding , and in snapshots of her boating and rock climbing , she looks young , vigorous and happy			0
and yet soon , according to her own self - imposed schedule , she will take a handful of pills that will end her life			2
since revealing her plans on a website and in a column this week for @entity18 , the @entity14 woman has become the new poster child for the " death with dignity " movement , which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms			1
@entity26 is one of a small but growing fraternity of such people in the @entity29 and , due to her age , one of the most unusual			2
there were 71 physician - assisted deaths last year in @entity14 , one of five states where the practice is legal			1
the median age of those people was 71 , and none was under 35			0
since @entity14 passed its death with @entity45 in 1997 , fewer than 1 % of its 752 doctor - assisted deaths have been people @entity26 's age			1
in neighboring @entity49 , where physician - assisted death has been legal since 2009 , 3 % of those patients who died last year were under 45			1
" it is extremely rare			1
luckily , it 's very rare for young people to get a terminal illness in the first place , " said @entity53 , state health officer and epidemiologist with the @entity55			1
" a lot of times people think if you do n't look sick from the outside then you must not be			0
and that 's not always the case			0
" @entity26 was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in january , barely a year after she and her husband were married			0
after several surgeries , doctors said in april that her brain tumor had returned and gave her about six months to live			0
she moved from @entity72 to @entity14 to take advantage of that state 's law and says she plans to end her life soon after her husband 's october 26 birthday			1
since being posted monday to @entity79 , a video detailing @entity26 's decision has more than 3 million views			0
news outlets everywhere have reported her story , which has sparked online discussions around humans ' right to choose how we die			0
" because ( @entity26 ) is young and vibrant and articulate , she has generated a lot of attention , " said @entity89 , a board member of the death with @entity91 , which advocates for physician - assisted death for terminal patients			1
in recent days the center has received calls from around the country , he said , including from people with illnesses who want to move to @entity14			2
three states -- @entity14 , @entity49 and @entity104 -- have " death with dignity " laws that allow terminally ill , mentally competent residents to voluntarily request and receive prescription drugs to hasten their death			1
judicial decisions in two other states , @entity113 and @entity114 , authorize doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses in such circumstances , although the rulings have n't become state law			2
when assisted suicide is not the answer under @entity14 's law , doctors treating " death with dignity " patients prescribe doses of barbiturates , @entity53 said			1
the patients then decide on their own whether to take them , and when			0
@entity14 public health records show the pills typically render a patient unconscious in a few minutes , with a median time of 25 minutes between ingestion and death			1
the so - called " death with dignity " movement is opposed by many religious and right - to - life groups , which consider it assisted suicide			1
but polls have shown that most @entity29 support having a say in how they die , especially if the process is described not as doctors helping a patient " commit suicide " but as ending a patient 's life " by some painless means			1
" " i think there is something of a movement here , " @entity149 , professor of bioethics at @entity152 's @entity151 , told @entity18 's @entity153			0
" when you push @entity29 to say , ' do you want choice on this matter ? ' i think a lot of them are going to say yes			2
" when surveyed about why they wished to end their life , @entity14 's terminally ill patients said they most feared losing their autonomy as their illnesses worsened			1
@entity26 may feel the same way			0
" i 've had the medication for weeks			0
if i were , i would have consumed that medication long ago			0
i do not want to die			0
and i want to die on my own terms , " she wrote on @entity18			0
" having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important			2
it has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear , uncertainty and pain			0

@entity3 , 29 , plans to take medication soon that will end her life
the terminally ill woman is a patient under @entity14 's " death with dignity " law
