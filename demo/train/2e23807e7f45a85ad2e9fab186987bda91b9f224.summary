a 20 - year dispute between a @entity2 rancher and federal rangers over illegal cattle grazing erupted into an @entity6 - style showdown on the open range this week , even prompting self - proclaimed members of militia groups from across the country to join the rancher in fighting what they say is @entity14 " tyranny			1
" what began as a legal fight between longtime rancher @entity17 and the @entity14 @entity18 has escalated as @entity17 kept his cattle on the federal land , and the government has responded by beginning roundups of the livestock			1
a confrontation teetered on violence wednesday when @entity17 family members and dozens of supporters angrily confronted a group of rangers holding tasers and barking dogs on leashes near @entity33 , about 80 miles northeast of @entity34			1
federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted			2
@entity39 family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a taser			2
in the end , the rangers got into their white suvs and drove away , a @entity43 video of the incident showed			1
" get out of our state ! " the cheering protesters yelled at the rangers as they departed in several vehicles			2
" blm go away ! @entity18 go away ! " they added , referring to the @entity18			0
the entire incident is now under investigation , @entity54 , the bureau 's director in @entity2 , said thursday			0
to some , the 67 - year - old @entity17 is a hero who hails from a long family of ranchers stretching back to the @entity6			1
to environmentalists and the feds , however , he 's an outlaw of sorts who owes @entity14 taxpayers more than $ 1 million in unpaid grazing fees			1
the @entity14 government is rounding up @entity17 's cattle that it says have been grazing illegally on public lands in @entity70 for more than 20 years , according to the land - management bureau and the @entity72			1
between saturday and wednesday , contracted wranglers impounded a total of 352 cattle , federal officials said			1
@entity17 says he owns 500 of the more than 900 cattle that federal officials are planning to confiscate for illegal grazing , the @entity77 reported			1
@entity17 told the newspaper that each head of his livestock is worth about $ 1,000			1
since the roundups began , protesters have been confined to two areas to publicly declare their grievances , but the peaceful protests in recent days " have crossed into illegal activity , including blocking vehicles associated with the ( roundup ) , impeding cattle movement , and making direct and overt threats to government employees , " the two federal agencies said in a statement			2
on wednesday , a bureau truck driven by a civilian employee assisting in the roundup " was struck by a protester on an atv and the truck 's exit from the area was blocked by a group of individuals who gathered around the vehicle , " the agencies ' statement said			2
in the scuffle with protesters , a police dog was kicked , and officers protecting the civilian driver were threatened and assaulted , the two agencies ' statement said			0
" after multiple requests and ample verbal warnings , law enforcement officers deployed @entity118 on a protestor , " the statement said			0
the profanity - laced tussle was captured on a video posted on @entity43			1
a group that said it posted the video did n't respond to requests for comment			0
in the video , protesters demanded to know why a backhoe and a dump truck were being used in the roundup -- and whether any livestock were killed			1
on thursday , @entity54 said the heavy equipment was used for field restoration			0
" no @entity18 ! no @entity18 ! " the protesters chanted to rangers in the middle of a two - lane rural highway			2
what sounds likes zapping @entity118 can be heard in the video			0
in the wake of the publicized protests , members of various militia groups have been traveling from @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 and arriving at the protest site and @entity17 's ranch to support the family , said @entity153 , 45 , of @entity154 , a member of one such group called the @entity156			1
" it 's tyranny in government , " @entity153 said when asked what brought him to @entity2			0
and , he added , " stealing people 's cattle			1
" one banner at the protest side stated : " has the @entity6 been won ? @entity164 has the fight just begun ! " in removing @entity17 's livestock from public lands , the park service and land bureau are carrying out two @entity14 @entity171 orders from two different judges			1
" cattle have been grazing in trespass on public lands in @entity2 for more than two decades , " the @entity72 said			1
" the @entity18 and @entity72 have made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and judicially			0
impoundment of cattle illegally grazing on public lands is an option of last resort			1
" added the @entity18 : " mr. @entity17 has also failed to comply with multiple court orders to remove his cattle from the federal lands and to end the illegal trespass			1
" the bureau does allow grazing on federal lands -- it administers 18,000 grazing permits and leases on 157 million acres across the country , the agency said			2
@entity17 's dispute with the government began about 1993 when the bureau changed grazing rules for the 600,000 - acre @entity198 area to protect an endangered desert tortoise , @entity193 reported			1
@entity17 refused to abide by the changes and stopped paying his grazing fees to the federal bureau , which he contends is infringing on state rights			1
his family has been ranching since the 1800s , before the @entity14 @entity206 was created and endangered species became a federal issue , he said in an interview with @entity193			1
" my forefathers have been up and down the @entity211 ever since 1877			0
all these rights i claim have been created through pre-emptive rights and beneficial use of the forage and the water			0
i have been here longer			0
my rights are before the @entity18 even existed , " @entity17 told the station			2
" with all these rangers and all this force that is out here , they are only after one man right now			0
whether they want to incarcerate me or whether they want to shoot me in the back , they are after me			0
but that is not all that is at stake here			0
your liberty and freedom is at stake , " he continued			0
and @entity17 sees it as a state issue			2
" the federal government has seized @entity2 's sovereignty ... they have seized @entity2 's laws and our public land			2
we have no access to our public land and that is only a little bit of it , " he said			0
this week , @entity2 gov. @entity249 told the bureau of residents ' criticism of the roundup			0
what @entity249 said he found " most disturbing " was the @entity18 's use of a " first amendment area " that confined protesters to a designated area			0
such an area " tramples upon @entity260 ' fundamental rights under the @entity261 , " @entity249 said			0
" no cow justifies the atmosphere of intimidation which currently exists nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are sacred to all @entity260			0
" in response , federal officials are allowing the protesters to gather on public lands as long as they do n't impede the roundup , said @entity54 , the @entity18 's director in @entity2			1
@entity17 is digging in for a long fight			2
" i 've been fighting this for a number of years			0
it 's not about my cows , i 'll tell you that much , " he said at a town meeting on wednesday night			0
" it 's about freedom and liberty and our @entity261 ... and above all it 's about our policing power			0
who has policing power today ? " with the growing controversy , it was uncertain thursday how long the cattle roundup will now last			2
at wednesday night 's meeting , residents gave @entity17 a standing ovation when he publicly spoke			1
" i love you people			0
and i love this land , and i love freedom and liberty , " @entity17 told the crowd			1
" i know without doubt that our @entity261 did n't provide for anything like the federal government owning this land , and so when i pay my grazing fees -- if i owe any grazing fees -- i will sure pay it to the right landlord , and that will be to @entity70 , @entity2			2
