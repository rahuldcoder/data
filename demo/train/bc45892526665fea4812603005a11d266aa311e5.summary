the arrival of @entity22 and @entity23 has meant @entity3 have not missed wantaway former captain @entity24 , while @entity25 has blossomed along with @entity26 and @entity27 for the @entity29 winners			2
" last year was difficult , because some of the media criticized @entity3 for defending more than attack , " @entity2 said			1
" ( now ) the boss plays with a different system ... @entity35 , @entity26 is playing fantastic now , @entity22 , @entity25 is unbelievable			0
" @entity2 scored the goal that ended @entity3 's 35 - year wait for a trophy at @entity39 in may , and he said that if @entity5 's men can maintain the form that has taken them top of the @entity45 table then they can be a serious threat to @entity4 's dominance			1
" for me it 's important that you have to first win something , and last year we did it			0
but this year , i think if we continue like that , if we win a couple more cups , maybe we can be like them , because @entity4 is this fantastic machine of football , " the 28 - year - old said			2
" i 'm full of confidence this year , i think this year is going to be amazing for us			0
