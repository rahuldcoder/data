-- @entity2 's imminent transfer to @entity3 for a reported world - record fee has been criticized by @entity6 coach @entity5			1
with @entity7 struggling amid a tough global economic climate , @entity5 questioned the appropriateness of @entity3 spending on just one player a figure reputed to be at least $ 125 million and possibly as much as $ 145 million			1
" he 's a very good player , but the numbers seem to me almost a lack of respect for the world in general , " the @entity13 told reporters on saturday at a press conference ahead of @entity6 's trip to @entity17			1
@entity2 , who plays for @entity24 club @entity23 , is next week expected to be unveiled as @entity3 's fifth world - record signing since 2000			1
it will reportedly happen after @entity3 , seeking to win back the @entity28 title from @entity6 , play @entity29 on monday in the club 's second game this season			1
@entity6 spent $ 75 million to sign @entity33 from @entity34 in june , but @entity5 said the @entity36 striker is not guaranteed to start sunday 's match in @entity17 despite the absence of the injured @entity39			1
the four - time world player of the year is being rested as a precaution after suffering a bruised thigh in the first leg of the @entity44 against @entity45 last wednesday			2
" honestly , i am not worried because i think he is fine , " @entity5 said of his compatriot			2
" what happened the other day was coincidence			0
i think it is totally unnecessary to take risks at the start of the season			2
" @entity33 came off the bench to score the equalizer against @entity45 , but @entity5 played down expectations surrounding the 21 - year - old			1
" i do n't share this idea that says that @entity33 must take over and take the lead if @entity39 is not there to do it , " he said			0
" we have @entity63 , we have @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67			0
there are too many players to expect @entity33 to automatically be in the starting line - up			0
" nothing is going to shorten the time we think is necessary for @entity33 to be ready			0
" @entity2 has reportedly already traveled to @entity7 , and will not play in @entity23 's home match with @entity74 on sunday			1
the 24 - year - old @entity76 international , who became the most sought - after talent on the planet following @entity33 's decision to join @entity6 , also missed the @entity82 club 's opening match of the @entity24 season last weekend			1
spurs have twice broken their club transfer record in apparent preparation for @entity2 's departure , signing @entity36 midfielder @entity87 and @entity7 striker @entity88 , while a $ 45 million deal for @entity90 was hijacked by @entity91 despite the @entity93 player having passed a medical at @entity95 last week			1
in saturday 's @entity24 action , @entity96 joined @entity91 on two wins from two games after beating @entity100 1 - 0 , as striker @entity101 followed up his goal from the opening victory over @entity104			2
@entity105 , beaten by @entity100 last weekend , relieved the pressure on manager @entity107 by defeating @entity82 rivals @entity108 3 - 1 as @entity110 forward @entity111 scored twice and @entity113 striker @entity112 netted the other for the visiting team			0
former @entity100 and @entity117 striker @entity116 marked his @entity108 debut with a goal after coming on as a second - half substitute , but @entity105 notched another morale - boosting win ahead of the second leg of the @entity125 qualifier against @entity126 -- having won 3 - 0 in @entity127 last wednesday			0
@entity128 drew 0 - 0 at home to @entity130 , and there was also a stalemate between @entity133 and @entity134 , while @entity135 hit back to hold visiting @entity136 1 - 1			0
@entity137 beat @entity138 1 - 0 but fellow promoted side @entity140 crashed to a second successive defeat , losing 2 - 1 at @entity104			0
in @entity28 , @entity142 crashed 3 - 1 at @entity143 despite taking the lead through @entity146 forward @entity145			0
@entity147 headed a 33rd - minute equalizer before second - half goals from @entity150 and @entity151 sealed victory for the @entity6 - based team			2
@entity154 came back to earth with a bump following last week 's 2 - 0 win over @entity158 in the final @entity125 qualifying round , being held 1 - 1 at promoted @entity160			2
@entity162 striker @entity161 saved @entity154 with a second - half leveler following @entity165 ' second - minute opener .			0

@entity3 expected to complete world - record signing of @entity2 next week
coach of @entity3 's @entity171 rival questions need to spend so much in *current* climate
@entity6 's @entity5 says the size of the reported fee " lacks respect "
