-- at a hearing on tuesday , maj. @entity1 , the @entity2 psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people at @entity4 , @entity5 , in 2009 , for the first time publicly explained that he was motivated by a desire to protect the leadership of the @entity10 -- in particular , @entity11 , the overall leader of the movement			1
prosecutors say that as @entity1 opened fire on a room full of soldiers filling out paperwork for their upcoming deployments to @entity19 and @entity20 , he shouted " @entity21 ! ( @entity22 is great ! ) " maj. @entity1 can represent himself the massacre at @entity4 is part of a trend of " homegrown " @entity27 - inspired terrorist attacks and plots against @entity30 military targets			1
for those individuals who buy in to the @entity33 's key claim that the @entity30 is at war with @entity35 , @entity30 soldiers who are fighting wars in @entity39 countries make compelling targets			1
indeed , more than a quarter of all the jihadist extremists who have carried out or plotted attacks inside the @entity30 since the 9/11 attacks have targeted the @entity30 military			1
since 9/11 , 21 people have plotted to attack @entity30 soldiers or military installations , according to a count by the @entity50			1
before he went on his rampage at @entity4 , @entity1 had contacted the radical @entity53 - @entity30 preacher @entity52 over the @entity54 to ask whether it would be permissible for a @entity30 soldier to kill his comrades in the name of @entity35			1
@entity60 's responses were noncommittal , and although the conversations were a red flag to some law enforcement officials who were monitoring these communications , those officials did not alert the military			0
a @entity67 report released after @entity1 's attack found that the military 's official relations with the @entity72 's @entity71 were " inadequate , " which might have contributed to the failures to communicate about the threat some law enforcement officials suspected @entity1 might pose			2
here are some other examples of plots or actions that targeted the military : a few months before the @entity4 attack , another jihadist extremist killed a @entity30 soldier at a military recruitment center in @entity83 , @entity84			1
@entity85 , a convert to @entity35 whose preconversion name was @entity85 , had also attracted attention from federal law enforcement			0
despite being questioned by the @entity72 about a suspicious trip he had recently taken to @entity53 , @entity90 was able to obtain a semiautomatic rifle , a pistol and ammunition , as well as the ingredients for a @entity97 cocktail			0
a month after @entity90 attacked the military recruitment center in @entity84 , a @entity39 convert named @entity99 was arrested along with six other men , accused of leading a terrorist cell that plotted to attack the @entity103 base at @entity104 , @entity105 , outside @entity106			2
@entity99 had a history of run - ins with the law , but his group still managed to amass weapons and conduct paramilitary training before they were discovered			0
a similar 2011 plan involved @entity114 , who plotted with @entity115 to use grenades and machine guns to attack military recruits at an office complex in south @entity120 as revenge for purported atrocities by @entity30 soldiers in @entity19			1
four years earlier , a group of @entity39 living in southern @entity125 who were virulently opposed to the @entity127 told a government informant they were plotting to kill soldiers stationed at the nearby @entity131 army base			2
in the wake of the attack there , @entity4 tightened restrictions on who was allowed into the facility , posted more armed guards in strategic locations around the base and implemented the random searching of containers			2
an extensive independent review to find the " lessons from @entity4 " focused on identifying radicalization within the @entity30 armed forces , a phenomenon that poses a particularly grave threat because of soldiers ' access to weapons and secure military facilities			1
the review also identified some of the procedural problems that led to the military 's failure to prevent the @entity4 attack			2
following the review , then - secretary of defense @entity159 issued a directive ordering the implementation of 47 recommendations to improve " force protection " at military bases in the @entity30 these included giving military personnel better guidance on identifying suspicious or radical behavior by their comrades , establishing better relations between the @entity67 and the @entity72 's @entity71 and improving communication mechanisms for sharing real - time crisis information across military commands and installations			2
but while establishing methods to identify extremists is a somewhat feasible goal in a regimented , closely monitored system such as the military , it is not as easy for authorities to do so in the broader community , particularly when the individuals seem to be " lone wolves " who are not part of a formal terrorist group			0
two attacks last month on soldiers living in the @entity191 fit this category			0
on may 22 , two men rammed a car into @entity196 soldier @entity195 as he was walking down a street in suburban @entity198			0
they then hacked at him with a meat cleaver and left his body in the road while a bystander filmed one of the attackers			0
the slaying was justified as " @entity206 , a tooth for tooth ... because @entity39 are dying daily			0
" the following weekend , in what might have been a copy - cat attack , a young @entity39 convert who investigators believe " acted in the name of his religious ideology " stabbed a 25 - year - old @entity216 soldier in a @entity218 suburb			0
he was likely targeted because in recent years , @entity216 soldiers have served in @entity39 countries such as @entity19 and @entity222			0
the suspect , identified only as @entity224 , first came to law enforcement 's attention when he was questioned briefly in 2009			0
@entity216 intelligence services reportedly became aware of the suspect 's increasing radicalization in february of this year			0
although there have been no successful attacks on @entity30 military targets since the @entity4 and @entity83 shootings in 2009 , six of the 15 jihadist extremists who plotted to attack inside the @entity30 in the past two years were targeting @entity30 soldiers or military installations			1
the trial of @entity1 serves as a reminder that @entity30 soldiers will remain squarely in the crosshairs of those few individuals in the @entity30 who are motivated by @entity27 's ideology			1
but in the wake of the @entity4 massacre , the @entity67 has made a concerted effort to identify and address the government failures that allowed @entity1 to carry out his attack , making another " insider " attack on a military facility in the @entity30 significantly less likely than it was four years ago .			1

@entity1 says he killed @entity30 soldiers to protect @entity10 leaders
@entity255 : @entity4 massacre was part of a trend of terrorists targeting military
it prompted new restrictions and security procedures at the base , he says
since 9/11 , 21 people have plotted to attack @entity30 soldiers or military installations
