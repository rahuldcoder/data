-- president @entity1 is expected to sign the final health care legislation into law this week , but while the action wraps up on @entity7 , the heated debate over reform shows no sign of cooling down			1
with lawmakers back in their districts for the spring work period , the conversation just moves to a different platform			1
for @entity15 , the two - week recess is an opportunity to highlight the immediate benefits of a law the public is not yet sold on			1
@entity15 say the health care law provides all @entity21 with the opportunity to receive health care and prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to those who need it most			1
for @entity27 , it 's a chance to rally support behind their efforts to repeal what they decry as a " takeover " of the health care system that will saddle future generations of @entity21 with debt			1
what 's the one thing you want to ask your representatives ? @entity27 have made " repeal and replace " their battle cry , and @entity1 has said he welcomes the fight			1
at an event in @entity45 , @entity46 , last week , the president scoffed at the @entity27 ' strategy , saying , " my attitude is -- go for it			2
" @entity51 rep. @entity50 last week introduced a bill to repeal the health care legislation , as did other @entity27 lawmakers			1
" we need to work together , whether we 're @entity27 , independents , @entity15 , we all have to work together for whatever is in the best interest of the @entity21 people			2
and repeal most certainly is in the best interest of the people because this bill will lead to economic harm if it 's left in place , " @entity50 told @entity63 ' " @entity62			0
" but @entity64 , chairman of the @entity65 , said he does n't think efforts to knock down the legislation stand much chance			0
" they may want to push forward on a repeal of health care , to tell small businesses you 're not going to get tax credits to pay for insurance , to tell families you now ca n't keep children on your policy until [ they ] 're 26 , to tell folks that you 're now subject to these abuses of the insurance industry			2
i think they 'd be unwise to do it			0
i think the @entity21 public will reject it , " he told @entity63			0
despite the opposing messages , both sides say the public supports them			0
@entity27 say the public opposes the president 's plan , but democrats insist that people will eventually accept the plan now that it is finalized			2
and so far , both sides have a point			0
most @entity21 disapprove of the health care reform law , but that does not translate into majority support for the " repeal and replace " strategy , according to a @entity102 poll released monday			1
@entity0 poll : @entity21 divided over repealing health care law meanwhile , polls from both @entity63 and @entity106 suggest that there has been a slight uptick in approval of the legislation following the vote			1
another survey , a @entity115 / @entity114 poll released sunday , indicated that the public 's overall view of the health care plan has held steady , with 46 percent supporting it and 50 percent opposed			1
the percentage of people who said they strongly support the health care legislation , however , increased by 10 points since february , while the percentage who strongly opposed it stayed about the same			1
" we 'll find out in november who won or lost this battle , " sen. @entity127 , @entity129 - @entity128 , told @entity63			0
" what i do next is , i 'm trying to replace those who voted for this bill			0
i want to repeal it			0
and i want to replace it with some real reform that puts patients in charge of their health care again , " he said			2
echoing @entity127 , @entity128 sen. @entity142 said he was looking forward to an election in november " about whether this health care bill is a real fix or a phony political document trying to grow the government			2
" calling the legislation a " giant @entity150 , " the @entity27 senator vowed that the fight " wo n't wind up just being in @entity151			0
" following a week of over-the - top rhetoric stemming from the health care vote , sen. @entity153 , a @entity154 from @entity155 , cautioned that if lawmakers do n't watch their own words , they 'll hurt their credibility			1
" if we do n't take ourselves seriously and act in a serious way , we 're not going to be taken seriously by the @entity21 people , " @entity153 said			0
" i have a suggestion			0
let 's go back to the three @entity129 's : respect , rules of engagement that promote decorum , and , no. 3 -- stop the rewards system that enables you to raise a lot of money after using outrageous and bizarre behavior , " she added .			0
