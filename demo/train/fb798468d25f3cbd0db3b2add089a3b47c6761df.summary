@entity7 said on @entity1 's " @entity24 , @entity25 " that she thought the cleanup was a long time coming			0
" we want to get along with the union			0
we want to get along with this person or that person			0
we do n't want to fire anyone , " she said			0
" but in the meantime , children have been done a disservice every single day			0
we have graduated a generation of @entity38 who do n't have the skills and knowledge that they need to be productive members of society because our schools have failed them			0
" @entity7 did not break down the number of teachers fired for poor performance versus licensing issues			1
under the impact program , teachers were judged on five classroom observation visits by principals and outside education experts			1
the system also rates teachers based on their students ' achievement			0
in response to the firings , the @entity59 released the results of a membership study showing that " a large majority of teachers believe that @entity66 is not a fair evaluation system			1

" but the thing is , in the whole year , we have raised , and the teachers have raised , lots and lots of different issues about the evaluation system , and the person who turned a blind eye to it was @entity7			2
" @entity7 told @entity24 that she had heard the teacher 's union say teachers with poor evaluations should have been given more time to improve			1
" but the question that i ask to them is ' whose children are we going to put in the classroom of ineffective teachers next year ? ' my two kids go to @entity126			2
i 'm not willing to put my kids in those classrooms , and i do n't think any parents anywhere in this city should be forced to make that decision , " @entity7 said			2
