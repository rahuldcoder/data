-- as scientists from around the world gathered in @entity4 for the @entity6 meeting , the success stories are pouring in			0
on monday , the @entity8 mission team released a new study showing that the former lake bed in which the @entity11 landed could once have supported microbial life			1
the @entity14 mission to @entity15 released a spectacular video of mysterious hexagonal clouds whirling over the planet 's pole			1
but the question on everyone 's mind is : will these missions be allowed to continue ? the answer may well be : no. next year 's @entity26 budget is poised to force premature cancellation of either @entity8 or @entity14 -- the agency 's flagship missions			1
funding decisions get made behind closed doors , but projected figures reduce @entity14 's budget in 2014 by almost half , and half again in 2015 , making it impossible to fly			1
even funding for analyzing data will be " restructured , " according to @entity26			2
these cuts are not only devastating for scientists ; they are also potentially harmful for our economy , and our leadership in @entity44 )			1
when most people think of spacecraft , they think of hunks of metal flying or driving around , alone in the far reaches of the solar system			0
some are cute and personable , like the @entity11 or @entity53 ; some , like @entity14 , are less well known			2
people might also recall the gorgeous photos spread across the front pages of the @entity58 or on the cover of @entity60			0
a few might even think of the famous scientists who have brought these pictures to life , like @entity65 , @entity66 , or @entity67			2
the robots ' stories and adventures captivate us			0
but what about the people who created and operate the robots ? behind the scenes , largely invisible to the public , are many of @entity79 's best scientists and engineers at the @entity81 , @entity26 centers , and research facilities who work on these missions to make space exploration possible			1
the budget cuts will affect @entity79 's most experienced and most promising engineers and researchers			1
they may have to join the legions of the unemployed			0
do we really want to put someone like @entity93 , @entity26 's famous " @entity94 , " out of a job ? some may think that space engineers can simply move to the private sector			1
after all , companies like @entity99 or @entity100 are looking for talents			0
but private ventures involve different motives and skills			0
and private companies do not fund planetary science and experiments			0
moreover , private and public research institutions from @entity109 to @entity110 rely partly on @entity26 grants to support their graduate students , post-docs , and other staff in @entity44 fields			1
in other words , @entity26 funding not only expands the frontiers of our knowledge , it also trains the next generation of @entity44 leaders in our country			1
the budget cuts would deprive our young scientists and engineers the resources to continue their studies and , in turn , contribute to @entity79 's innovation			1
seen in perspective , the looming budget adjustment along with all the cuts in recent years sentences @entity79 's planetary exploration program to death by starvation			2
@entity14 , for one , is already operating on a shoestring			2
and @entity26 has put plans for future missions to the outer solar system on ice , despite efforts by the planetary community to plan cost - effective and exciting opportunities			2
the continuous gutting of @entity26 and its planetary science programs should outrage all @entity79			0
if we end the @entity14 or the @entity8 mission , it would be a crisis not just for science but for @entity79 's leadership in @entity44			1
at a time when our math and science students are getting left behind , and the public is looking to our high tech and scientific sectors to power innovation and economic growth , we should invest in our sciences and continue to inspire the next generation			0
let 's make sure our current best and brightest working on the cutting edge do n't get the pink slip			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

@entity26 budget may force premature cancellation of either @entity8 or @entity14
@entity170 : the cuts not only hurt scientists , but also our leadership in @entity44
@entity170 : do we really want to put someone like @entity26 's famous " @entity94 " out of a job ?
she says if we end the @entity14 or the @entity8 mission , it would be a *national* crisis
