-- those souped - up water ski machines are ideal vacation - time fun but they 've never been cheap			2
thanks to @entity4 designer @entity3 , the world has been graced with a solar - powered watercraft that costs just a third of the price of your average powered water craft			1
called asap , @entity3 's creation is part ski , part surfboard and part catamaran			1
powered by the sun , it 's both free to run and fully sustainable			1

@entity3 dreamed up the idea while on a lifeguard training course , where he spotted a gap in the market for a more effective and more affordable water rescue vehicle			2
" while doing my training , i found it incredibly hard to tow a body in the water and started looking at rescue equipment			0
i saw an opportunity to design something from scratch , " says @entity3			0
" a lot of rescue aids are simply re-purposed leisure equipment , for example a paddle board is just a surf board , and a @entity42 is just adapted for rescue purposes , so rescuers adapt the way they rescue people to the equipment rather than the equipment for them			0
" asap , however , has been designed with rescue missions in mind			1
@entity3 spent months studying on - duty lifeguards to get an idea of how his concept could better assist the process			1
in his final year as a design student at @entity56 he developed the first asap prototype in a tent in his back garden			0

it has a sloping center platform to slide the injured onto quickly , getting them buoyant as soon as possible and its v - shaped catamaran hull means it cuts through waves to avoid slapping , making it much safer for towing a casualty			0
@entity3 's creation is timely			0
according to the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) drowning is the third leading cause of accidental death around the world , yet with rising fuel prices petrol skiers are becoming an increasingly unfeasible option for local and charity run rescue stations			0
at the moment asap can travel up to 15mph , but it 's still under development : " it 's not going to have the super power of a @entity42 but it will certainly take the lifeguard to the casualty much quicker than swimming			0
we 're working on making the propulsion much stronger , " says @entity3			0
@entity94 set @entity3 up with industrial design kingpin and mentor @entity96 , who loved the product but suggested he insert solar - powered lights so that asap glows as it goes			1
although only at its second prototype , asap has already won an award for @entity103 in the @entity4 @entity104 and @entity3 is thinking about how to expand : " i 'd love to be able to offer solar charging stations to local councils so they can charge their watercrafts whenever they need to			1
" and the good news is that soon he hopes to introduce his solar - powered watercraft to the leisure market , which means we wo n't need to undergo any grueling training or save any lives to give it a whirl .			1

asap is a solar - powered watercraft which *combines* skis , surfboard and catamaran
it is fully sustainable and free to run and costs about one - third the price of a traditional water skier
@entity4 designer @entity3 developed asap to assist lifeguards on rescue missions
