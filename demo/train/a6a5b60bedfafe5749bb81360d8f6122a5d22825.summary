-- a prominent conservative judge expressed concerns tuesday about whether @entity4 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage was constitutional , saying that given " modern conceptions of marriage , " the state 's law seems " harder to justify			1
" the remarks came during an unusual series of oral arguments played out over one afternoon at the federal appeals court in @entity14			1
a three - judge panel @entity17 @entity16 heard lawyers from four states defend their same - sex marriage bans , in a dramatic series of consecutive cases from @entity4 , @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25			1
in the first petition from @entity4 , judge @entity26 had tough questions for the state 's solicitor general			1
" what do we do about a reality that marriage -- it changes with social mores ? " asked @entity31 from the bench			0
" and maybe , originally , marriage was about encouraging procreation ... but modern conceptions of marriage are more about love , affection , and commitment			0
and when you think of that way , it does seem a little harder to justify , even on rational basis grounds , " he said			0
a winning streak @entity31 , who was named to the court by president @entity53 , added : " if you think about marriage just through that at lens â € ” love , affection , commitment -- it does start to get gets a little difficult to see the difference between the one group eligible ( to marry ) and the other group not			1
" the appeals panel could extend a remarkable winning streak for gay rights supporters , after state and federal judges in about two dozen cases have struck down same - sex marriage bans in the past year			1
this after the @entity72 in june 2013 tossed out a key part of a federal law defining marriage as only between one man and one woman			2
four separate rulings the current intermediate review stage will produce four separate written rulings in coming weeks			0
appeals of one or all of those state bans will likely end up at the @entity72			2
there the justices could finally answer whether same - sex couples have a constitutional equal protection right that must be applied in every state , including the 31 with current bans			1
federal appeals courts have already struck down similar bans in @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 in recent weeks			1
two of the three judges on the panel this week were appointed by @entity99 presidents , leading to predictions they would uphold state bans			0
the judicial panel was tough on both sides , particularly @entity31 , who ask probing questions of lawyers representing various gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to wed , or to have their home states recognize valid out - of - state marriages			2
" if respect and dignity ( for gay couples ) are critical elements here , i would have thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process , " said @entity31 , citing those states that have chosen to change the law in the past decade			2
conservative argument he suggested taking the challenge in the courts was not the best strategy			0
" do n't you think you 're more likely to change hearts and minds through the democratic process , than you are with the decision of five justices on the @entity72 ? assuming you can win on this , why do you want that route ? " he asked			0
that has been the argument many conservative activists have made in preserving the marriage status quo			0
@entity4 's solicitor general @entity139 defended the current ban , saying " it 's rational for the state to have an interest in promoting marriage , so it will be more likely a child will have both a mother and father , and will have the benefits of having both a mother and a father			1
but judge @entity151 , named to the bench by president @entity153 , jumped in			0
" but what is the rational basis of excluding everybody else ? it does n't interfere with the procreation of children just because you 've got two people of the same sex marrying in and in some of those marriages , one of the partners is able to procreate			0
" complete discretion and when @entity139 said the state had an interest ensuring " procreation occurs in long - term committed relationships between opposite sex couples , " the judge seemed unconvinced			2
" is n't that a little hypocritical , " said @entity151 , " to allow people to marry who ca n't procreate , but prevent same sex partners from marrying , and in some of those marriages , one of the partners is able to procreate ? " the nine members of the high court have complete discretion to accept or deny any case presented to them			0
their recent precedents however , give unbridled optimism to many in the gay rights and civil rights communities they will at least get their day in court			2
a sweeping judicial victory may be tantalizingly close			0
" you never know how any @entity72 case is going to be resolved , especially when the stakes are this high , but the challengers definitely have the upper hand , " said @entity190 , publisher of @entity191 and a prominent @entity193 attorney			0
also argued tuesday was @entity24 's ban			2
the commonwealth 's @entity201 gov. @entity200 hired outside lawyers to defend the ban on recognizing out - of - state same - sex marriages , after his attorney general tearfully refused in march to take part in any further legal challenges			1
more than 70 lawsuits by @entity0 's count , there are more than 70 same - sex marriage lawsuits pending in every state with a current ban			1
@entity215 this spring becoming the latest , and last , to have one filed in court , on behalf of seven homosexual couples			0
the @entity72 could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework , potentially striking down every current same - sex marriage ban			1
or the justices could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place , allowing state legislatures and state courts to sort it all out , for now			0
a @entity0 / @entity228 poll released a year ago found an apparent cultural shift -- 53 % of @entity230 now support same - sex marriage , up from 40 % in 2007			2
and that survey showed 56 % of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same - sex marriages			1
@entity94 ban overturned @entity99 on same - sex marriage the facts about same - sex marriage			1
