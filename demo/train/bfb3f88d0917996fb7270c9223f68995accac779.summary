-- @entity1 has granted @entity3 asylum out of concern the @entity6 founder will be politically persecuted if extradited			1
the decision is a victory for @entity3 , who is trying to avoid being extradited to @entity9 and has been holed up inside @entity1 's embassy in @entity11 for nearly two months			1
but the bad news for @entity3 is that @entity14 police have refused to grant him safe passage out of the country			1
the @entity14 government has pledged to send @entity3 to @entity9 to face questioning on sex crimes charges , but @entity1 's foreign minister says if @entity3 is sent to @entity9 , he could then be extradited to the @entity21 to face charges of espionage or treason			1
more : @entity1 grants @entity3 asylum @entity3 and his supporters say a @entity21 grand jury is weighing charges against him			1
@entity21 attorney general @entity29 has said that the @entity30 has an " active , ongoing criminal investigation " into the @entity6 disclosure of classified @entity21 diplomatic documents			0
@entity0 spoke to @entity34 , an @entity35 diplomat of more than 30 years and now director of the @entity37 advisory group in @entity11 , about where the @entity3 situation is heading			2
@entity0 : can @entity3 leave @entity11 ? @entity34 : the fact @entity1 has granted political asylum to @entity3 does n't actually make any real difference			1
clearly he is not in @entity1 , he is in the @entity1 embassy in @entity11 , and for the time being he is able to remain there without being arrested			2
but he ca n't get to @entity1 without leaving the embassy without being arrested , so in a sense , it 's a standoff			2
@entity0 : could @entity3 escape by car or by plane ? @entity51 : it 's very unlikely			2
the embassy only occupies a part of the building , and is not a compound embassy , which has a car park inside it			0
vehicles belonging to the embassy enjoy a degree of immunity , so if it was a compound embassy , he could get into the car , which could in theory take him out of the building			0
but at some point it would have to stop , and he would have to get out of the car and into an airplane , whereupon he would be arrested			0
but @entity1 's is not a compound embassy , so as soon as he steps out the door he is liable to be arrested			1
more : of all countries , why choose @entity1 ? immunity would in theory apply to an @entity1 airplane , but that plane would have to have permission to land that the @entity14 government would not give			0
it 's really hard to see how that could work			0
also , that sort of subterfuge would be regarded as such a blatant disregarding of the convention on diplomatic relations that the bilateral relationship between @entity14 and @entity1 would mean even further damage to @entity1 's interests in the @entity14			1
more : timeline of @entity3 's extradition battle @entity0 : is there anything @entity14 police can do ? @entity51 : all they can do is wait and watch			1
in theory the foreign secretary could make use of a 1987 act of @entity101 to end to the inviolability of the @entity1 embassy , but this would take authorities into a gray area			0
theoretically , this legislation is to be invoked in cases connected to public safety , national security , or town and country planning			0
clearly @entity3 fits into none of those categories , and it 's unlikely the @entity14 police will be going into the embassy anytime soon			1
@entity0 : is there a precedent for marching into another country 's embassy ? @entity51 : while authorities could theoretically test the 1987 law , i ca n't think of any instance in this country where a government entered the premises of a mission ( embassy ) without permission from the head of the mission			1
the reasons for that are clear : @entity14 does n't want to have itself in a situation where foreign governments can just march into its embassies overseas and arrest people			0
diplomatic relations are established on the basis of reciprocity , and that is very important			0
@entity0 : how have @entity14 and @entity1 handled the @entity3 issue ? @entity51 : in @entity14 , i suspect that in the @entity145 there may be a slight sense of regret that they included a paragraph in their letter ( to @entity1 ) about the 1987 law ( informing officials they had the legal wherewithal to enter the embassy and take @entity3 ) , because clearly it stung the @entity1 in a way			1
more : why @entity3 's own country wo n't intervene but i think it was always going to be a long haul to get this issue resolved , given that president @entity161 is quite sympathetic to what @entity3 stands for ; given that he had already been on the record publicly saying he was in favour of granting @entity3 asylum			2
it was always going to be difficult for him to walk away from that without losing face			0
@entity0 : can @entity3 stay in the embassy forever ? @entity51 : i do n't think mr. @entity3 is going to be going anywhere , let alone @entity1 , for the time being			1
there was the case in @entity174 of the bishop who sought refuge in the @entity21 embassy for 15 years , so some cases can take literally years to resolve			0
@entity0 : what will the atmosphere be like in the embassy ? @entity51 : i 'm sure they will have made him as comfortable as possible in the circumstances as they possible can			0
but it 's a big distraction from their day job , and it 's awkward having someone who 's not on the diplomatic staff actually inside your embassy for any length of time , let alone for periods of months , so there is a price to pay from the embassy 's point of view			0
opinion : @entity3 's stubborn grip hurt @entity6 information from @entity203 was used in this report .			2

@entity1 grants asylum to @entity3 , who is holed up in @entity1 's @entity11 embassy
@entity14 police refuse to grant @entity6 founder safe passage out of country
@entity51 : no precedent in @entity14 for entering another country 's embassy
@entity51 : such a move would further damage @entity1 - @entity14 relations
