these days , @entity0 is a confident 22 - year - old who smiles easily and talks excitedly about her plans for the future			1
but the rising senior at @entity6 's @entity5 had to travel a long and difficult road to get to where she is today			2
@entity0 was taken away from her parents when she was 7 years old			1
she still remembers vividly the day that long journey began , when a woman she had never seen before and has n't seen since came in a car to get her and her brother @entity15 , who was 3 or 4 years old			2
" it was pretty scary for me , " @entity0 said			1
" my brother and i were in the back with a bag full of both of our belongings			2
my biological mother got out of the car and the lady kept driving , and she drove to someone else 's house and she told us we 'd be staying there , and she left			0
and so nobody really explained to me what foster care was , or what being taken away from your parents meant , or how long it would be for or why it happened			1
" @entity0 spent five years in foster care in @entity38 , @entity39 , shuttling from one family to the next			1
during that time , @entity0 said , she suffered sexual abuse and her brother suffered emotional abuse			1
" if it was n't me being abused then it was me seeing my brother being abused , which was more difficult for me , " she said			0
" i felt strong enough to endure the abuse as long as my brother did n't have to go through it , and so i would always try to be there , like after school			1
i would try to make sure i got home and was just there with my brother to make sure he was ok			0
" she was eventually removed from that situation and ended up with @entity54 , who later adopted her , adding to a growing family of adopted children			2
but during the process she and her brother were separated			0
@entity0 has n't seen @entity15 in 12 years			2
@entity58 : breaking down barriers so foster kids can find families now she is one of 15 former foster children participating in the @entity64 run by the @entity65			1
the program aims to give former foster children an opportunity to help shape public policy on child welfare issues			1
interns spend the summer working in the offices of members of @entity74 from both parties			0
at the end of the program , they make a presentation to the entire @entity74 with recommendations on how to improve the foster care system			1
the interns live in a college dormitory and have weekly dinners to talk about their experiences on the @entity86 and growing up in the system			0
they also get a stipend for a business wardrobe and informal career counseling from the @entity91 , an organization that works with @entity65 to help them get a start on their professional lives			0
the program is competitive , about 250 young people apply each year and applicants must have completed at least one semester of college			0
@entity65 executive director @entity99 said the young people who are accepted are the cream of the crop			0
former interns have gone on to clerkships and to various positions in state government			0
nearly half have entered careers in social service			0
" we find that the youth who have survived foster care are , by their nature , more problem solvers , " @entity99 said			1
" so what better people to bring to bear on a problem that really needs to be solved ? " pushing for change @entity0 survived that system and says there 's a lot she wants to see changed			1
she wants to create a one - stop online clearinghouse laying out the resources available to foster youth and former foster youth all across the country , and she wants states to do more to keep siblings together in foster care			1
" it 's not just keeping them together , but making sure that they 're in stable environments , " she said			0
" in the system , youth are taken away from -- most of the times -- their biological parents because they 're suffering from some kind abuse or something like that , and so i do n't think that being placed into a home where you suffer the same things solves much			1
" she has been interning in the office of sen. @entity145 , @entity146 , who had her own encounter with an orphan at a young age and has been an advocate for foster children and orphans since she was first elected to office			2
" when i was a child , a young teenager , i literally found a little 9 - year - old sleeping in a park and it was just horrifying to me that a child would be alone sleeping anywhere , let alone sleeping in a park , " @entity145 said during an interview in her @entity156 office			0
" i brought him home and that was my beginning of understanding about a child that was homeless , living with a grandmother incapable of raising him			0
and then , of course , he went through the foster care system , and that 's when i learned how broken it was			1
" @entity145 , who helped create the internship program 10 years ago , said a tax credit to help families adopt and a program that helps provide education , and training vouchers to foster youth as they transition out of the system , have helped , but more needs to be done to improve the system			1
" the foster care interns that come to @entity184 learn a lot about the system here and how it affects their lives and the lives of children in foster care all over @entity193 , which are about 500,000 , " @entity145 said			1
" but most importantly , it educates members of @entity74 and their staffs about what really happens in our foster care system , and we think out of this great changes for the better will occur			1
" @entity0 is still searching for her younger brother , who she believes would be 17 or 18 years old now			1
" i worry constantly , " she said			0
" i was able to be adopted and i had a lovely life and all these siblings that love me , i have a mom who loves me , you know i 'm just living a great life right now			0
and i do n't know if his situation was as blessed as mine was			0
" and then there 's also -- he could have been bouncing around from foster home to foster home and i was n't			2
he could have been adopted and it 's possible his adoptive family did n't want him to have contact with his biological family , and i think about those things all the time			2
" when she graduates in the winter , @entity0 plans to pursue a career in broadcast journalism -- a field she loves and that she hopes might one day help @entity15 find her			2
for now , she feels fortunate to have had what she calls a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to spend a summer in the halls of @entity74 and to share her story			0
" there are so many things i want people to know , " she said			0
" one of the main things that i want people to know is that foster youth count			0
