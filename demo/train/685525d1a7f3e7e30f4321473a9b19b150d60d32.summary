@entity0 -- the seizure of the @entity8 @entity7 's top military leader in @entity9 represents a turning point in the @entity3 - led war against the militants , @entity3 officials and analysts said			1
the arrest of @entity16 represents the most significant @entity7 capture since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , a senior @entity14 administration official said tuesday			1
@entity16 has been a close associate of @entity19 's and is seen as the no. 2 figure in the @entity8 @entity7 , behind @entity21			1
" if anyone would know where the senior leaders are of @entity27 and the @entity7 , then @entity16 is someone who would be privy to that kind of information , " said @entity22 , executive director of the @entity23			1
it 's " major success for the @entity31 " and " a major blow for the @entity7 , " @entity22 said			1
the @entity3 has tried to target @entity16 for years , a senior @entity3 official said			2
the arrest also represents a " new level of cooperation " between @entity9 and @entity3 forces working to rout the @entity7 , said @entity3 sen. @entity37 , chairman of the @entity38 and co-author of legislation designed to improve cooperation between @entity9 and the @entity3			1
described as a savvy and modern military leader , @entity16 was arrested in the southern @entity9 city of @entity45 several days ago , a senior @entity9 intelligence official said			1
the official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media			0
@entity16 is being held in joint custody and investigated by both the @entity31 and @entity9 's @entity50 , another senior @entity9 source said			2
qari @entity51 , a @entity7 spokesman in @entity8 , denied that @entity16 had been captured			1
he said @entity16 is continuing his operations and is in @entity8			2
another @entity8 @entity7 spokesman , @entity53 , also denied @entity16 had been arrested			1
he said reports of his arrest are designed to demoralize the @entity8 @entity7			1
despite confirmation of the arrest by @entity9 sources , @entity9 interior minister @entity56 said he could not verify reports of the capture			0
he also denied reports the @entity31 and @entity50 conducted a secret raid that captured @entity16 , saying the agencies share intelligence but that the @entity31 does not conduct raids on @entity9 soil			2
@entity69 blog : more on @entity16 and the @entity7 several raids in @entity45 last week netted dozens of suspected @entity8 militants , and intelligence agencies are in the process of verifying their identities , @entity56 said			1
@entity16 's arrest occurred as some 15,000 @entity8 and @entity77 forces were battling the @entity7 in the @entity79 region of southern @entity8 's @entity80 in the largest @entity77 offensive since the @entity3 - led invasion of @entity8 in 2001			1
it also comes weeks after the @entity31 ratcheted up its operations against the @entity7 in apparent response to a december suicide attack that killed seven @entity31 officers in eastern @entity8			2
and the arrest comes amid reports of major successes for the @entity3 in its battle against the @entity7 and associated militants in @entity8 and @entity9			1
the leader of the @entity9 @entity7 , @entity92 , died recently after reports that a suspected @entity3 drone strike targeted him in january , according to @entity7 and @entity9 intelligence sources			1
the previous leader of the @entity9 @entity7 , @entity96 , also died in a suspected @entity3 drone strike			1
@entity1 national security analyst @entity98 called @entity16 's capture a " huge deal , " saying he is " arguably more important than @entity21 from a military point of view , because @entity21 really is more of a religious figure than an operational commander of the @entity7			2
" " this guy also is the no. 2 political figure in the @entity7			0
the fact that he was discovered in @entity45 is very significant			0
@entity45 is the largest city in @entity9			2
it 's a long way from where the war is being fought , " @entity98 said monday on @entity1 's " @entity107 360 Â°			0
" the capture " indicates that the @entity9 intelligence services and @entity31 [ are ] cooperating very closely on a very high - value target			0
" a number of high - value targets , including @entity21 , have moved into @entity45 from a region near the @entity9 - @entity8 border , where the @entity9 military and suspected @entity3 drones have battled @entity7 militants , a senior @entity3 official said			1
@entity98 said the operation suggests the @entity9 are willing to move not only against the @entity9 @entity7 but also against the @entity8 @entity7 , which has its headquarters in @entity9			1
@entity16 also would have been in regular contact with @entity21 , @entity98 added			0
@entity125 , a fellow at the @entity126 , called the move a " huge catch in terms of understanding the organization , " but she also said the " @entity7 is in many ways a decentralized force , and it 's not necessarily that he is going to be involved in knowing what every single unit on the ground is doing			0
" " the critical issue is how much will he talk and provide information on where other assets are , potentially where the @entity7 in @entity9 are , and , of course , the @entity3 would love to know where @entity19 himself is , " @entity141 said on " @entity142			1
" @entity141 also raised the issue of what will happen to @entity16 when the interrogation concludes			0
" one of the big questions , of course , is , what are they going to do with him ? " @entity141 asked			0
" they ca n't take him to @entity151			0
are the @entity9 going to prosecute him ? " according to @entity152 , @entity16 was born in 1968 in @entity154 village in the @entity155 of @entity156 in southern @entity8			1
@entity98 said @entity16 and @entity21 run the @entity157 , which operates in southern @entity8			2
" in terms of the information about the southern @entity8 operations of the @entity7 , this guy is potentially a gold mine , " @entity98 said			2
" i suspect he 's not being read his miranda rights by these @entity9 people who are interrogating him			0
" @entity165 , director of the @entity166 , a @entity9 think tank , called @entity16 " basically the de facto leader " of the @entity7			1
" with @entity21 staying out of the scene , @entity16 was running the operations of the @entity7			2
" @entity16 and @entity21 " started the @entity7 together			2
he was in the movement since the very beginning , " @entity165 said			0
" he is a very skilled military tactician			0
when the @entity7 were in government in @entity8 , he was the supreme commander of the army and was heading the charge against the @entity176 holdouts at that point in time			0
" @entity165 said the setback is significant because @entity16 was directing the @entity7 's activities in @entity8 at the time of his arrest			1
" his capture would be a severe blow to the @entity7 morale at a time when the operation in the @entity80 province is under way			0
" @entity165 said @entity16 and @entity8 president @entity190 hail from the same @entity192 tribe			0
@entity190 has talked about reaching out to some @entity7 members , and a @entity195 profile of @entity16 last year said that " @entity16 once authorized a @entity7 delegation that approached @entity190 with a peace offer " and that he approved peace feelers to @entity190 's brother			0
those efforts did n't go anywhere , the magazine said			0
@entity204 , director of analysis at the @entity207 think tank , said @entity16 has been representing @entity21 at some of the peace talks going on behind the scenes with the @entity211 and describes his capture as a big catch			0
@entity204 said the @entity9 did n't do this for free ; they want concessions from the @entity3 , and it 's a shift in the strategy on how it 's dealing with the @entity8 @entity7 in its own territory			1
the @entity9 have launched offensives against the @entity9 @entity7 , and now the move indicates they might plan to get tough on the @entity8 @entity7			1
" it 's not like you have one guy , and that immediately opens the door to everyone else			0
it 's hard to believe that this will lead to this huge intelligence coup			0
but if the @entity9 are shifting their mode of cooperation , that is significant			0
" @entity1 's @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
