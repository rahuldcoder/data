-- the new video released by @entity3 leader @entity2 makes a simple demand : he wo n't release the more than 200 schoolgirls his group abducted from a school northern @entity9 " until after you release our brethren			1
" the " brethren " he refers to include several hundred @entity3 fighters , including key commanders , currently held in jails in @entity9 , as well as in @entity16 and @entity17			1
it is a demand that he has made before , and a demand that , crucially , the @entity9 government has at least once conceded			2
almost exactly a year ago , fighters from @entity3 entered a dusty town close to the border with @entity17			1
they headed for the police station , army barracks and prison buildings			0
the dawn raid on may 7 , 2013 , on the town of @entity30 left more than 100 people dead , including many civilians			0
the @entity3 fighters freed about 100 inmates from the prison			1
but -- little reported at the time -- they also abducted about a dozen women and children to use as bargaining chips , according to @entity39 , an analyst with the @entity40 and long - time observer of @entity3			1
days after the @entity30 raid , @entity3 's @entity2 appeared in a video that showed the hostages			1
he warned that if @entity9 security forces " do not release our wives and children , we will not release theirs , " and the hostages would become his " servants , " according to @entity39 , who provided @entity0 a link to the video			1
according to @entity39 , among the women and children allegedly held by @entity9 authorities were @entity2 's wife and three children , the wife of @entity3 's commander in the town of @entity61 and his children , and the wife of the group 's commander in the town of @entity67			1
the tactic appears to have worked			0
two weeks later , @entity9 president @entity69 directed that women and children " in detention on suspicion of involvement " with @entity3 would be freed from prison			1
the hostages held by @entity3 were released or , according to the official version , " rescued " by security forces			2
@entity39 told @entity0 that altogether nearly 100 @entity3 members and their relatives were set free -- and that @entity9 security sources told him there was a financial payoff by the government to the group to close the deal			1
it 's now clear that in conceding to a key @entity3 demand , the @entity9 government was inviting more such abductions			1
and as @entity9 detained more of the group 's members and sympathizers , @entity3 's determination to secure their freedom increased			1
the video that @entity2 recorded after the @entity30 attack last year has striking similarities to the one obtained by @entity98 on monday -- in which he demands the release of all @entity3 members in jail in return for the freedom of more than 200 girls kidnapped last month			1
@entity39 said " @entity2 wants all @entity3 prisoners freed because they because they will have renewed loyalty to him , and him alone " after internal rifts in 2012 and 2013			2
" and the militants freed from prison will allow @entity3 to benefit from their bomb - making and kidnapping skills to launch new and fiercer attacks in @entity9 , @entity17 and the border region , " he said			1
a behind - the - scenes payment could help the group recruit members and purchase weapons , as well as buy " loyalty from tribal elders in the @entity9 - @entity17 border area , " @entity39 said			2
@entity3 has additional reasons to believe kidnapping can be lucrative			0
early last year , a group of its fighters crossed into @entity17 and abducted a @entity130 family on safari			2
@entity2 showed off the family -- just like he has shown off other hostages -- in video obtained by @entity98 in march 2013			0
" we are holding them hostage because the leaders of @entity17 and @entity9 detained our women and children under inhumane conditions , " he said			0
after secret negotiations between @entity2 and the @entity17 government ( through intermediaries ) , @entity3 released the family near the @entity9 - @entity17 border -- reportedly in exchange for a $ 3 million ransom and the release of 16 @entity3 prisoners held in @entity17			1
by resolving the current crisis and securing the girls ' freedom , the government would likely be sowing the seeds of another			0
but by pursuing the military option , it could endanger the lives of many of the girls , who are thought to have been split into groups and possibly smuggled across the border into @entity17 and @entity163			0
even if the @entity9 military tracks down and frees one group , @entity3 might take revenge by killing others			2
as for its longer - term goals , @entity2 said @entity3 will not negotiate a cease - fire until it " brings the @entity9 government to its knees			2
" in terms of a political settlement in return for an end to violence , @entity3 has not outlined its goals			0
@entity39 believes the group " would likely demand a de-facto @entity181 - like @entity180 in some portion of northeastern @entity9 and the border region , " a demand that would be unpalatable to the federal government because it would damage the already shaky integrity of @entity189 's most populous nation			0
but @entity39 said it 's notable that in the latest video , the girls ( at least some of whom are likely @entity193 ) are forced to wear the hijab and that a flag behind them is typical of @entity198 affiliates			0
" the appearance of them ' unharmed ' makes it look like @entity3 is doing this for legitimate @entity204 purposes to win a prisoner exchange -- as opposed to sex slavery			0
" in the video , @entity2 states : " everything that we are doing is in the @entity209 and in the @entity211 ( sayings attributed to the @entity212			0
) " many have objected to that assessment and last year a group called @entity216 -- set up to counter @entity3 in northern @entity9 -- said they rescued 26 abducted women and girls , some of whom were pregnant , or had given birth , according to @entity222			1
" many girls who were rescued or had escaped were sent off by their families to distant cities like @entity228 and @entity229 to avoid the stigma of rape or pregnancy outside of marriage , " activists said , according to a report from @entity222			0
according to the @entity222 report , residents of @entity235 said that on several occasions , members of @entity3 forcefully abducted several teenage girls			2
@entity222 quoted one man who had documented such cases : " after storming into the homes and throwing sums of money at their parents , with a declaration that it was the dowry for their teenage daughter , they would take the girls away			0
" another said : when we made @entity235 " too hot " for @entity3 , they ran away without their wives			0
" now they are picking up women anywhere and using them to satisfy themselves			0

@entity3 has kidnapped before and @entity9 has conceded at least once
a raid on a town last year freed inmates , and @entity3 took about a dozen hostages
