president @entity0 denied an accusation on sunday that he had misled voters about his signature health care law in order to get it passed in 2010			1
" we had a yearlong debate			0
i mean , go back and look at your stories , " @entity0 told reporters at the @entity9 summit in @entity10 sunday			2
" the one thing we ca n't say is that , ' we did not have a lengthy debate about health care in the @entity16 ' or that it was not adequately covered			0
" " the fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that i completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run , " @entity0 said			1
the comments the president referred to were made by @entity25 , an @entity27 health care economist , who noted in a 2010 speech that he " helped write the federal bill " and " was a paid consultant to the @entity0 administration to help develop the technical details as well			1
" in a series of speeches that have recently regained attention , @entity25 says that engineers of the law , including the administration , took advantage of voters ' " stupidity " in order to get the measure to pass			1
" lack of transparency is a huge advantage , " @entity25 said in a panel discussion at the @entity45 in 2013			2
" and basically , you know , call it the stupidity of the @entity16 voter or whatever			0
but basically that was really , really critical to getting the thing to pass			0
" " ( i wish ) we could make it all transparent			0
but i 'd rather have this law than not , " he said			0
in another video , @entity25 calls the strategy an " exploitation " of the @entity16 voter			2
" it 's a very clever , you know , basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the @entity16 voter , " @entity25 said at the @entity63 2012 at the @entity64			1
@entity0 vehemently denied sunday that his administration was anything but transparent regarding the creation of the law and the debate that surrounded its implementation			1
" i would just advise every press outlet here : pull up every clip and every story			0
i think it 's fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent			2
it was a tough debate , " @entity0 said			1
" now , there were folks who disagreed with some of these various positions			0
it was a tough debate , " he added the latest video is the sixth of its kind to emerge of @entity25 detailing the political process behind the creation of the @entity93			1
in the video , @entity25 explains how ' mislabeling ' the law helped the administration get rid of tax breaks			1
" it turns out politically it 's really hard to get rid of , " @entity25 said at the @entity97 in @entity98			1
" and the only way we could get rid of it was first by mislabeling it , calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it 's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans			0
" on friday , former @entity113 press secretary @entity112 told @entity115 's @entity114 that @entity25 's remarks were generally " very harmful politically to the president			1
" " this is not good , " @entity112 said			0
" ( @entity119 ) speaks from the ivory tower with remarkable hubris about the @entity16 voter and by extension the @entity124			0
" @entity112 and his former boss are n't the only democrats distancing themselves from @entity25 's remarks			1
on friday , @entity113 minority leader @entity127 said she did n't even know who @entity25 was , despite having formerly cited him on her website when she was @entity113 majority leader			2
" i do n't know who he ( @entity25 ) is			2
he did n't help write our bill , " @entity127 said at a press conference			0
" with all due respect ... you have a person who was n't writing bill our bill commenting on what was going on when we were writing our bill who has withdrawn some of statements that he made			0
