-- for the first time in history , a woman has received the highest honor in mathematics , often nicknamed the @entity6 of mathematics			1
since it was established in 1936 , the @entity8 had gone only to men , until wednesday , when @entity10 received it in @entity12 , @entity13 , from the @entity14			1
" this is a great honor			2
i will be happy if it encourages young female scientists and mathematicians , " @entity10 said , according to a statement from @entity17 , where she is a professor			1
for those of us less versed in the uppermost echelons of mathematics and geometry than @entity10 , it 's mind - twisting to understand the abstract accomplishments that got her field 's highest recognition			1
@entity10 has delved into the depths of geometry , helping bring unexpected order to an area that many of her colleagues considered chaotic and hardly tamable			1
and her peers have found this very exciting			2
the @entity14 called her long list of accomplishments in @entity42 surfaces and moduli spaces " stunning			2
" what are those ? simply put , those are complex geometric forms			2
anyone who has had high school algebra and geometry may remember that shapes like squares , triangles , circles and spheres are described by mathematical formulas			0
but jump to more complex , roundish , theoretical objects , like perfectly formed doughnuts , ultra-warped , crisscrossed potato chips , undulating geometric pretzels or uneven blobs like amoebas			0
that 's getting close to the kind of math and geometry @entity10 works with			1
go deeper , and things can appear to descend into infinite chaos			0
find that intimidating ? some bright mathematical minds do , too			0
" because of its complexities and inhomogeneity , moduli space has often seemed impossible to work on directly , " the @entity14 said			0
" but not to @entity10			1
" but even she finds those theoretical depths challenging			0
" it is like being lost in a jungle and trying to use all the knowledge that you can gather to come up with some new tricks , and with some luck you might find a way out , " she said			0
what 's it good for ? @entity10 's work was not driven by any practical purpose -- like engineering -- but purely to satisfy mathematical curiosity , to create more knowledge			1
the implications of her work go beyond just the description of shapes			0
since her area of math also informs physicists , her work could help advance scientists ' understanding of the origins of the universe and the workings of subatomic particles , which could have implications for engineering			1
the @entity14 praised @entity10 for her mastery of various contrasting aspects of mathematics			1
equally as impressive is how @entity10 got to where she is today			1
from @entity105 to @entity17 she discovered her knack for numbers in high school in her native @entity109 , where she grew up in the capital , @entity105			0
media in @entity109 are also reporting about her achievement			0
" it is fun -- it 's like solving a puzzle or connecting the dots in a detective case , " she said			0
as a teenager , she gained international attention when she won gold medals in two @entity122 , achieving a perfect score in one of them			0
@entity10 got her undergraduate degree at @entity126 , then moved to the @entity127 , where she went to work on her doctorate at @entity129			1
she was an assistant professor at @entity130 before moving to @entity17			0
the @entity8 , officially called the @entity131 in @entity132 , is awarded every four years			1
the past 52 recipients were men			2
this year 's medal went to four recipients in total			0
the other three were also men .			2

the @entity8 is often nicknamed the @entity6 of mathematics
since it was established in 1936 , it *previously* had gone only to men
@entity10 helped bring unexpected order to an area considered chaotic by many
she hopes her receiving the award will encourage young women in the field
