editor 's note : rep. @entity2 , a @entity3 , represents @entity5 's 2nd @entity4 and is appearing in @entity7 's " freshman year " series along with rep. @entity8 , a @entity9 from @entity10			1
rep. @entity2 says the @entity11 should be repealed			1
( @entity7 ) -- after weeks of looking for the perfect puppy , my partner @entity12 and i adopted @entity15 last month from the @entity16 and brought her back to @entity17 with us			0
we wanted to make sure we adopted a small breed that would n't grow too large for us to bring on board the aircraft and commute with from @entity5 to @entity17 each week			2
we finally found a beautiful 11 - week - old terrier mix and adopted her on the spot			0
her slightly larger and noisier two brothers were there with her , and we bid them farewell and escorted our puppy to her new home			0
with the health care debate temporarily on hold until @entity35 leaders bring a new bill to the floor , members of @entity31 have had a chance to once again address the plethora of issues on our legislative plates			1
for me , this meant working on important education and environmental legislation as well as speaking in favor of @entity47 equality and immigration reform , while trying to spend time with @entity15 during her important formative weeks			0
thirteen years ago , @entity31 passed the so - called @entity11 , or @entity11 , which effectively outlawed same - sex marriage			2
at that time , no states allowed same - sex couples to marry			0
it was a so - called " defense " against something that was only hypothetical at the time			0
today we have tens of thousands of married same - sex couples in this country , raising families and paying taxes in the five states that have granted them the right to marry			0
both president @entity64 , who signed @entity11 into law in 1996 , and rep. @entity66 , who originally authored @entity11 have agreed it is time for its repeal			2
this law prevents states from determining what marriages to allow or not allow by second guessing them at the federal level			2
to end this injustice , i co-authored legislation that would ensure that valid marriages are respected under federal law , and spoke at a press conference outside the @entity82 @entity81 announcing the bill 's introduction this week			1
the @entity85 will provide couples with much - needed certainty that their lawful marriages will be honored under federal law and that they will have the same access to federal responsibilities and rights as all other married couples			2
the @entity85 would not tell any state who can marry or how married couples must be treated for purposes of state law , and would not obligate any person , church , city or state to celebrate or license a marriage of two people of the same sex			1
it would merely restore the approach historically taken by states of determining , under principles of comity and full faith and credit , whether to honor a couple 's marriage for purposes of state law			1
churches should be able to decide what kinds of unions are sanctified by their denomination , but not what kinds of unions are accepted in the civil arena			0
as an example , the @entity122 will not remarry a divorced person ( without an " annulment " ) , but divorced men and women are allowed to remarry under civil law			0
no one should be denied the opportunity to choose his or her spouse			1
it is a basic human right and deeply personal decision			0
throughout history , we have only moved forward when society has distinguished between traditional values and valueless traditions			0
the so - called @entity11 is a valueless tradition that , like laws against interracial marriage that were finally overturned by the @entity143 in 1967 , undermines the spirit of love and commitment that couples share and sends the wrong message to society			1
it is time for its repeal			0
@entity11 is out of date and out of touch with the heart of the @entity82 people			0
it is causing these same - sex couples and families serious and lasting harm and it is time for its repeal			0
immediately following the @entity11 repeal press conference , i switched gears , put on my yarmulke , and took part in an interfaith prayer vigil to end the hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric that been heard on the nation 's air waves and , sadly , even spread to halls of @entity31			1
when talking about immigration reform , i remind people that , regardless of where our parents come from , the @entity82 was built by immigrants and continue to grow and progress in part because we have a vibrant and innovative immigrant community			0
that 's why it is so personally frustrating to me when organizations cause hysteria instead of promoting a national debate on immigration policy			1
it 's a disservice to the @entity82 public and a disservice to the debate , which is one of our most important policy debates			1
unfortunately , this anti-immigrant hate speech has spread to the halls of @entity31 , threatening to poison the health care debate			1
@entity82 's @entity196 ( @entity35 3200 ) explicitly prohibits undocumented immigrants from subsidized coverage in @entity199 where it says " no @entity200			2
nothing in this subtitle shall allow federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the @entity82			2
" regardless of this fact , immigration continues to be used by some , including @entity82 representative @entity209 , @entity211 - @entity210 , as a tactic to stop debate and progress in health care reform			1
@entity209 's now infamous " you lie " outburst during president @entity219 's speech to the @entity31 offended our sense of decorum and civil debate so much that the @entity35 voted in a resolution that his comments were out of line			1
i think when the @entity82 people saw his outburst , they saw it for what it was			2
obviously we can not and will not solve the immigration debate through health care legislation			1
but with millions of immigrants living in this country and seeking health care while they 're here , we also can not ignore the urgent need to fix our broken immigration system			1
until we fix our immigration system , many undocumented immigrants will continue to lack insurance and drive up costs by using emergency rooms as their primary care providers			2
whether it is immigration , health care , or any other issue , the @entity82 people expect their elected representatives to build fair and workable solutions and to engage in debate that is not based on false information or lies			1
and as we saw at our prayer vigil , members of @entity31 , people of faith , law enforcement , organized labor , the business community , and @entity82 across this country are raising their voices in favor of real solutions rather than hateful rhetoric			0
@entity15 got stung by a bee on her paw this weekend , and we rushed her to the animal hospital			0
the vet was able to find the stinger and remove it , and she only limped for a day			0
but our nation will continue to limp until we remove the bee stinger of expensive foreign wars from the paw of our nation			0
we could fully fund health care reform and reduce the deficit with the costs of the expensive wars in @entity281 and @entity282 and we would still have enough left over to teach our undocumented immigrants @entity284			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : federal *government* should n't *intervene* in state marriage laws
he says no one should be denied chance to choose spouse
he says rep. @entity209 's outburst was a breach of decorum
he says health care debate is being affected by anti-immigrant sentiment
