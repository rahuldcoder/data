@entity0 -- @entity2 ca n't remember what she was thinking when -- mouth agape , eyes bugged -- she shook hands with @entity8 in @entity9 this week			1
it all happened so fast , she says			2
what she does remember is the national response to the photo of her reacting with pure , unadulterated excitement to meeting the former secretary of state			1
media outlets pounced on the story			2
the @entity19 captured the reaction perfectly , writing that @entity21 had a " look on her face that has never been witnessed by anyone who is not a dad chaperoning a minivan full of teenagers at a @entity29 concert			1
" but why was @entity21 so excited ? what does she like about @entity8 ? and who else would she react that way to meeting ? @entity1 spoke with @entity21 friday over the phone thursday			1

( long pause ) i turned back at my family and i , like , i , you know , made the face			0
@entity1 : what did you think about all the attention your photo received ? @entity21 : well , i love it			1
because , well , it is not just because ... i think @entity8 is a a really good role model for girls of all ages and it [ the reason she liked the attention ] is n't just because it got a lot of cool places			1
i am just happy because people know that a younger girl still looks up to somebody like that			0
@entity1 : what is it about @entity8 that you look up to ? @entity21 : i like her because , like , she is running for president and a lot of people think that girls should n't be president because they are not as smart or they should n't have the same rights			1
and she is just a good role model for girls because , you know , she is just sort of , like , to everybody , ' girls can be awesome , too			1
' [ editor 's note : @entity8 herself has said she has yet to make a decision on whether she will run for president			1
] @entity1 : you are 10			0
when you were born , @entity8 had been well known for 20 years			1
how much did you know about her when you met earlier this week ? @entity21 : i did n't know , too , too , too much			1
i knew that she was the first lady for a while			0
and her husband is @entity103			0
and her daughter @entity105 just had a baby			0
and her niece 's name is @entity21			2
and that is my name			0
and when i first went up to her , i said , ' @entity21 , ' and she said that is one of her favorite names			2
@entity1 : who are some other famous people you would be as excited to see as you were with secretary @entity8 ? @entity21 : oh gosh , well , @entity118 , @entity119 , probably @entity120 and @entity121			1
did i already say @entity122 ? probably one direction			1
@entity1 : a local anchor in your hometown joked that you would be the first women president			2
would you ever want to do that ? @entity21 : maybe ! it is a really hard job			2
i think , i think , maybe			0
[ @entity132 's note : @entity21 will be eligible to run for president in 2040			1
] @entity1 : do you think you could do it ? @entity21 : yeah ! @entity1 : if @entity8 runs for president , what would your advice be to her ? @entity21 : i would say that even if you are different or you are a different gender , it does n't matter what you look like			1
i do n't know , like , if you wear glasses			0
@entity1 : if you could vote in 2016 , would you vote for @entity8 ? @entity21 : yes , totally			1
@entity1 : thanks @entity21 ... @entity21 : thank you			2
and one more thing : make sure if @entity145 [ her 12 - year old brother ] does give you the permission to use the photo , give him photo cred ! --- ( @entity1 did use the selfie that @entity145 took of his family and @entity8			1
