-- the end of the internet comes not with a bang or a procession of four lolcats of the apocalypse , but just with two blinking lights on a modem			0
at least that 's how it came for @entity11 , a 39 - year - old gaming consultant in @entity12 , when @entity13 shut him off from the internet for using too much data			1
@entity11 , it seems , committed the foul of using more than 250 gb of data on @entity13 two months in a row , triggering the company 's overage policy that results in a year - long ban from using its services			1
" it 's one of those things i never thought would hit me , " @entity11 said			1
" they did n't even call			0
i just got double blinking lights on my modem			0
" " if i 'd been foolish enough to depend on something like @entity35 or some other @entity37 service for 911 , i would have been hosed , " @entity11 said , arguing that internet service has become a utility much like water and electricity -- services that ca n't easily be turned off , due to regulations			1
it was the second month in a row that @entity11 got those blinking lights			1
the first time he called in and tried to figure out what the problem was			0
so he turned off the router he had that was open to the public , and asked his roommate to go a bit lighter on data usage , since his household is heavy on streaming media , including @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
wired : shed a tear , the age of broadband caps begins what he did n't count on , @entity11 said , was that @entity13 , who he was paying $ 60 a month for a @entity60 download speed , was counting uploads against the quota as well			1
just recently he 'd switched his online backup system from @entity64 to @entity65 , after @entity64 put an end to its unlimited back - up service			2
@entity65 has no such limit , but does throttle users ' uploads once it hits a high level			0
and @entity11 , a hardcore geek who at one point worked as a @entity74 technology evangelist for @entity75 and @entity76 , has a lot of data he shares with the cloud			1
he 's got his music ripped into lossless flac format , in addition to lower rates , amounting to about a gig a disc -- which he stores in a basement raid server that can handle 12 @entity87 of data			2
( he says it has plenty of empty space			0
) wired : @entity92 puts broadband users on monthly allowance as an amateur photographer , he saves his photos in raw format , which can run to about 10mb per image			2
and when @entity100 last week opened up its cloud music service to unlimited storage of music files in @entity104 , @entity11 batch - converted his collection and began uploading it			1
the music is what he assumes caused the problem , but he 's not sure			0
he admits to doing a little bittorrenting in the last month , but says it was limited to getting a few episodes of a famous @entity114 sci - fi show that 's not totally available in the @entity115 and all @entity13 is saying is that he 's kicked off -- and under the terms of the ban , he ca n't even switch to a uncapped , higher - priced , lower - speed business connection			1
@entity13 told @entity120 that @entity11 is at fault for not monitoring his bandwidth better			1
spokesman @entity123 says the 250 gb limit , which it imposed in october 2008 after agreeing to not throttle peer - to - peer traffic , is intended to keep users like @entity11 from impacting their neighbors			1
median data usage for its cable internet customers is 4 to 6 gbs per month , according to @entity123			1
wired : @entity131 halts unlimited smartphone data plans " looking at the facts , it appears that it is a straightforward story , " @entity123 said			1
" there 's not much we can say			0
we called and reiterated the policy and told him if he did exceed it again in six months , he would face suspension			2
" " if someone 's behavior is such that it degrades the quality of service for others nearby -- that 's what this threshold is meant to address , " @entity123 said			2
" it can negatively affect other people			0
" that 's in part because cable internet connections work off a loop of cable shared by a collection of customers			0
the more data being used , the slower everyone 's speed gets , unless the company spends the money to break a loop into smaller loops			2
( this is why cable connections can get very slow in the evening , when many people go online for entertainment			0
) you might think that @entity13 is trying to save money on bandwidth by capping the @entity174			2
but data usage is not very expensive for a large @entity176			1
it 's somewhere around 2 cents per gb of traffic sent to or received from the greater internet , and the prices keep dropping			0
wired : @entity13 rolls out broadband meters coast and coast oddly though , the 250 gb cap has n't increased at all since ' 08 , even as @entity13 has aggressively adopted better technology called @entity185 that lets them send more and more data through the same size pipes , which the company has used to increase the speed of customers ' connections , mostly without charge			1
the policy is ostensibly meant to help with congestion at peak times , but it makes no differentiation between data used in the evenings and that used from midnight to 8 a.m. when internet usage typically falls off			2
that 's a model that @entity115 are very familiar with , thanks to mobile phone calling plans that discourage calling during weekday business hours , when minutes are counted against a preset quota , while making nights and weekends calls free			0
however , the simple total bandwidth model is the one that 's become popular			0
@entity92 recently slapped a 150 gb per month cap on its dsl service , while @entity212 trialed services with extremely low caps , only to retreat after intense protest by customers and politicians			1
on the mobile front , @entity92 , @entity131 and @entity218 all have caps on mobile data usage ( with varying penalties and overcharges ) , leaving only @entity224 without any real cap			1
@entity11 , like many others , thinks @entity13 's limits are really about trying to protect its core video cable business from people switching to online alternatives such as @entity52 and @entity231			1
@entity11 says he 's weighing his other connectivity options -- which are limited to some relatively slow dsl connections and the troubled @entity234 to the home servie			1
@entity131 laid some fiber near @entity12 , but @entity13 's franchise agreements with the city prohibited @entity131 from laying fiber in the city proper -- and @entity131 has since given up on the area			1
so for now he 's using neighbors ' open access points and internet cafes to do his business , many of which are powered by @entity13			2
but he 's vowing not giving up quietly and has already posted about the cutoff on his blog , which attracted more than 130 comments by wednesday -- not all of them supportive			0
@entity11 vows to plead his case to politicians and regulators			2
" i struggle when i watch @entity13 raising broadband speeds , and at same time , saying they ca n't afford all this internet usage , without doing deep packet inspection and other invasive things , " @entity11 said			1
" they have n't laid new cable in 15 years			0
i 'm pretty much a nonregulation guy , and i 'd just rather let the market be competitive			0
but i get really frustrated in situations like this where what is truly a bad company is not being forced to improve because it does n't have to			0
i really do n't have any choices here			0
" @entity13 sees it differently			2
" people should be careful if they have a terabyte of data to back - up , " @entity123 said			0
" they should manage their consumption carefully , and do it over time			0
