? does the idea that some infinitely intriguing person / place / thing is currently flitting through your general sphere of being -- without your knowledge -- cause your heart to constrict with terror ? well , friends , we hear you			2
having just returned from the liquor - ( and other liquid - ) soaked climes of @entity17 and @entity18 , we 're pretty sure we only experienced about 1.3 % of all " @entity19 " present at that havoc - wrecked fest. basically , all we gathered was that people really like @entity22 , and , mysteriously , @entity23 ( thanks @entity24 ! ) and that the most - flogged apps at @entity26 were undoubtedly those who aim to kill @entity2 dead			1
enter : @entity27 , highlight and @entity28 , a new wave of social apps designed to keep you abreast of all the interesting people around you -- without requiring that you look up from your smartphone ( my precious ... ) ! these apps were , by far , among the most buzzed - about at @entity18 , with highlight taking the coveted top spot ( according to @entity38 )			1
charts and graphs aside , it remains to be seen whether highlight will be able to assume the many - storied role of " @entity44 " or " the @entity45 , " both of which gained traction at @entity48			2
that 's partly because it and these other apps run in the background on your phone , with always - on gps that drain your battery			2
but it 's mostly because the word " creepy " keeps coming up in the same sentence when people talk about this new cadre of mobile apps			1
still , do n't let that silly little adjective scare you off ! because if you do n't download these apps , you 'll be missing out ! and you do n't want that , do you ? do you ? ! we did n't think so			2
that 's why we 've provided a handy scale for you below , which should be instrumental in finding the level of " @entity73 " you fomo - sufferers are comfortable with			0
kind of creepy : sonar so you 're chilling at your apartment , staring -- moleperson - like -- into the glowing half light of your computer screen			1
all your @entity80 have finally drowned in the swimming pool , and you 're getting tired of thumbs - downing dubstep tracks on @entity83 , so you fire up @entity27			1
@entity27 is a pretty simple app for @entity85 ( in beta ) and @entity87 that shows you two things : who is chilling at hot spots near you , and who -- in general -- in your vicinity you might be interested in meeting			1
when you launch the app , you 'll be asked to connect to your social networks ( @entity97 , @entity44 and @entity98 ) , which lets the app deduce who might be interesting to you			1
click on the " places " tab and you 'll see a list of locations in your area			0
clicking on a location will surface a list of people at that spot ( generated via @entity45 check - ins , etc. -- one does n't have to be using @entity27 to show up in the app ) , and what level of connection you have to them -- how many @entity97 friends , @entity44 friends , etc. if you see someone you might want to stalk -- i mean , talk to , you can tweet at them from within the app. you can also check into that location if you manage to leave your cave and become an object of stalkage -- i mean , talkage -- as well			1
the app also features a " people " tab , listing which friends ( pulled from your social networks ) have currently checked in near you , as well as other people of interest			2
use that to hook up with your pals next time they " forget to tell you " about karaoke			0
it 's not your fault the only lyrics you know are " @entity142			0
" creepy : highlight you 're just your average tech - savvy businessman , all pimped out in front - pleated khakis , your startup - emblazoned t - shirt of choice , and , of course , your ubiquitous @entity152 swingin ' around your neck			2
reclining there on your barstool , sweating @entity156 in hand , you cruise the room with your eyes			0
with whom should you birth your future children -- uh , i mean your latest business venture ? suddenly , your cell vibrates in your holster			0
you whip it out with delight to see ... a shiny new notification from @entity169			0
could it be ? is your dreamboat partner in this very room ? ! @entity18 fave highlight is what is known as an " ambient location - sharing app , " which means that it is always on ( unless you " pause " it ) , alerting others using the service to your whereabouts			1
when you first install the app , you 'll be asked to connect via @entity97 , thus porting all your friends and interests into @entity169			0
from there on out , you 'll be alerted via push notifications every time someone of interest is nearby -- you know , folks with a lot of mutual friends , hobbies , taste in tv , etc. these interactions will also be stored in a kind of in - app log			1
from there , you have the option to check out their profiles and send them a message if you feel keen on meeting			0
you can also " highlight " people for future reference , which is kind of the equivalent of a " wink " on an online dating site ( @entity213 a complete wuss move )			2
that 's right , tech - savvy businessman , now you can meet all kinds of interesting people -- mere feet from your nervous self -- without the hassle of the initial awkward introduction			1
highlight now , message one mojito later			0
meet irl if they deign to answer you			0
super creepy : banjo your doll collection just is n't cutting it anymore			0
seriously , how much can one stretch one 's imagination when it comes to weaving background stories for inanimate objects ? and @entity239 's wares are n't getting any cheaper			0
if only you could discover some brand new friends -- complete with dossiers ( like the books that come with those @entity245 dolls ) -- with whom to maybe , possibly , someday but not likely hang out with			0
well , you 've got a friend in @entity28 ! banjo serves two purposes : it alerts you when a friend is in your vicinity , and it gives you a glimpse into the lives of those around you -- and around the world			1
upon downloading the @entity87 / @entity85 app , you can connect to @entity44 , @entity97 , @entity45 , @entity257 and @entity258 to keep track of all your friends			0
when a friend posts content or checks in using any of those services near you ( you can change the distance from one - fourth mile to 10 ) , you 'll get an alert			0
if they 're using @entity28 , you can send them a message in - app , and if they 're not , you can post a message to whatever content or check - in they shared , asking them to join the service			1
( we do n't recommend doing this unless you 're ok with someone putting cheesy words in your mouth like : " how cool ! @entity28 tells me we 're close by , so let 's connect ! ) if the whereabouts of your friends are less than thrilling ( " @entity285 , who the @entity286 cares that you went to the bodega and bought dish soap ? ! " ) , you can toggle over to the " explore " map or the " people " box to check out a graphical representation of people in your area			1
that info is collected via check - ins / content as well , so users do n't have to be @entity28 members to show up on your map			1
from there , you can click through whatever content they 're sharing -- tweets , @entity257 photos , etc -- and live vicariously to your heart 's content			1
you can even message folks if they 're @entity28 members ( or spam them -- like your friends -- if they 're not )			1
bonus : banjo also shows who has looked at you , so there 's plenty of opps for potential couples to awkwardly check out each other 's profiles until one of them breaks			2
the app even lets you creep internationally , virtually zooming around cities like @entity323 and @entity324 and anywhere else your heart desires			0
and you thought that @entity328 doll from the @entity330 collection you bought last week was an international adventure !			0

@entity27 , highlight and @entity28 are a new wave of social apps that were all the buzz at @entity18
sonar shows who is chilling at hot spots near you and who you might be interested to meet
highlight alerts you when people who share your interests are nearby
banjo lets you see whatever content -- tweets , photos , etc. -- nearby users are sharing
