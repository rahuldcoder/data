@entity0 -- president @entity2 arrives in @entity3 on friday looking to bolster ties with an ally at a moment when it 's reeling from a ferry disaster that killed 180 people at last count			1
@entity2 , as he often does at home as " consoler - in - chief , " will offer support to survivors and victims ' families as he pauses from the policy and diplomatic demands of his week - long trip to @entity19			1
last week , @entity2 called the disaster " heartbreaking , " a gesture that was noted and well received within the government in @entity0			2
the capsizing of the ferry @entity25 carrying almost 500 people , including high school students on a field trip , has occupied most of @entity3 president @entity31 's time over the past week			1
@entity32 has confronted outcry from @entity3 who want answers on why the ferry turned over			2
a criminal investigation is underway			0
the ferry disaster will no doubt overshadow some part the original intent of @entity2 's visit — to reinforce ties with a strong @entity43 ally in the increasingly important @entity44			1
@entity45 against @entity46 both countries want to display a united front against @entity46 , which in recent days has stepped up activity at its main nuclear test site — possibly in preparation for another underground blast			0
the @entity46 @entity53 this week described @entity2 's trip to @entity0 as " a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region			1
" @entity2 , speaking thursday , called on @entity46 " to start changing your behavior			2
" " they are the most isolated country in the world			0
they are subject to more international sanctions and international condemnation than any country in the world			0
as a consequence , their people suffer as much as any peoples in the world , " he said			0
aims to reassure @entity77 allies @entity2 headed to @entity0 from @entity78 , where a formal state visit — complete with a royal audience and a black - tie dinner — was meant to exhibit strong ties between @entity83 and the @entity43			1
@entity85 officials hope the week - long trip to @entity19 will reassure @entity77 allies the @entity43 remains committed to turning its foreign policy focus to them			1
but he has few tangible " deliverables " to take home			0
in @entity78 at a news conference with @entity83 prime minister @entity92 , @entity2 was pressed on whether he would use military force to defend an obscure set of islands controlled by @entity83 that are at the heart of a heated regional dispute with @entity98			1
he said the @entity43 security pact with @entity83 does extend to the islands -- known as @entity101 to the @entity98 -- and insisted his implicit offer to defend them against any @entity98 incursion did not amount to drawing a red line around the contested land			2
" the treaty between the @entity43 and @entity83 preceded my birth , so this is n't a red line that i 'm drawing , " @entity2 said			1
" there 's no shift in position , no red line			0
were simply applying the treaty			0
" @entity2 plays soccer with robot the group of islands and rocks jutting out of the ocean is tiny and uninhabited			2
but the long - standing dispute over them has sent tempers flaring in @entity123 and @entity78 , especially in recent years			2
the area around them in the @entity126 between @entity127 and @entity128 is believed to be rich in oil resources			0
@entity101 is administered by the @entity83 , but the @entity98 claim they are the rightful owners			2
the possibility of a war over the islands has been a thorn in the side of the @entity43 , which says it is obligated by the common security agreement to back @entity83			2
@entity2 repeatedly urged that @entity83 and @entity98 seek a peaceful resolution through dialogue			1
a pivot to @entity140 and @entity141 in his second term , @entity2 has had limited success in issuing ultimatums in the hopes of halting aggression from nations like @entity140 and @entity141			1
but he seized on the line of questioning over the islands to defend his handling of the crisis in @entity153 and @entity141 's bloody civil war			1
warning a new round of sanctions against @entity140 are " teed up , " the president said he doubts @entity158 will honor its commitment last week in @entity160 to deescalate tensions in eastern @entity153			1
" do i think they are going to do that ? so far , the evidence does n't make me hopeful , " @entity2 said at the news conference , acknowledging @entity140 has yet to reverse course in the face of mounting economic pressure			0
but on @entity141 , @entity2 said his policy of diplomacy first had a direct effect on the removal of 87 % of that country 's chemical weapons stockpiles			1
" the fact that we did n't have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms -- it 's a success , " @entity2 said			0
asked if he was confident with @entity2 's assurances on @entity83 's security , @entity92 pointed to @entity2 's leadership in rallying the @entity184 economic powers to apply sanctions on @entity140			1
the missing plane @entity0 is the first of two stops on @entity2 's tour where citizens are coming to grips with major transportation disasters — on saturday @entity2 flies to @entity193 , where government officials continue to search in vain for the @entity197 jetliner that disappeared more than a month ago			0
those officials have come under withering censure , accused of botching the search and keeping family members of those on board in the dark			0
so far the @entity85 has avoided faulting @entity193 leaders for the efforts , instead highlighting the @entity43 efforts to help locate the plane			0
@entity2 has spoken publicly about the missing plane only once , during an interview in mid-march , offering @entity43 assets to help in the search			0
@entity213 rivals @entity98 and @entity83 deploy @entity215 villain in latest spat @entity1 's @entity217 and @entity218 in @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
