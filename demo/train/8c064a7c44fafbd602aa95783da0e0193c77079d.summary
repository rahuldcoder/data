editor 's note : @entity2 co-founded a technology company , @entity4 , and a financial research company , @entity5			0
he works currently in the fields of clean energy technology and policy and is chairman of @entity10 which successfully pushed for the use of hybrid cars as taxis in @entity14			0
@entity15 says the @entity17 program promotes fuel economy and safety while boosting the economy			1
@entity14 ( @entity21 ) -- our country is facing a daunting economic challenge this year and we must take steps to pull ourselves out of this ditch			0
one such program that has hit the ground running is cash for @entity17			1
it 's helping consumers move beyond these hard times and has reignited a whole industry			1
cash for @entity33 is now working in more than 10 countries around the world			1
in @entity37 , consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there			1
so we know that @entity17 programs get the job done			1
how many other government programs can you say that about ? the @entity45 has joined the @entity46 in passing an additional $ 2 billion for @entity17 , allowing the program to move forward			1
this will bring additional buyers to the showroom			0
one key feature of the @entity17 program is that it is not just $ 3 billion of new money into the economy			1
it is injecting $ 21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car			1
that is a lot of stimulus for the dollar			0
cash for @entity17 is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain : from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers			1
dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program			1
if you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program , 45 percent are from @entity79 's @entity78 automakers			0
that is a lot of new sales for @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
cash for @entity86 also helps autoworkers across the country			2
let 's remember that lots of the @entity91 and @entity92 sold in the program are made by @entity95 workers right here in this country			0
they are in states such as @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
this program helps all @entity95 autoworkers , not just those up @entity104			0
some people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way			1
cash for @entity86 actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry			1
first , the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate , finance , manufacturing and other industries , that is hard to separate it out			1
second , one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance			2
we import about $ 700 billion more than we export			0
that hurts our capital flows , credit and other key indicators			0
guess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance ? oil			2
we use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the @entity95 and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really do n't like us			2
we use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars , suvs , and other vehicles			2
unless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate , we will never reduce our oil consumption			2
cash for @entity86 is a step in the right direction			2
it educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low - @entity151 car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle			1
a family can save $ 750 - $ 1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency			2
those savings will increase as gas prices go back up			0
gas has already shot up from $ 1.50 a gallon to $ 2.60			0
do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile - per - gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $ 4 a gallon ? third , @entity17 saves lives			1
when you bring in a clunker that has no airbags , anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does , you are protecting your family			1
forty thousand people die every year on @entity95 highways and many more get serious injuries			0
you can reduce your chances of becoming a statistic by getting the most safety for your dollar -- and with the @entity17 program you can now do that more affordably			1
as a co-architect of the federal cash for @entity178 with the @entity183 and the @entity184 and adviser to various congressional offices on the issue , it is gratifying to see how quickly it has been adopted by the @entity95 people			2
it achieves multiple goals -- it stimulates auto sales , increases the efficiency of the @entity95 fleet and makes us safer			0
let 's support this program by encouraging our friends and neighbors to finally retire that guzzler and help the country with the purchase of a cleaner , lower maintenance car for the future			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0
