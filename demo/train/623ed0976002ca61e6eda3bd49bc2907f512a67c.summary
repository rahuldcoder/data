seems to be a novel idea			0
joining a " car share , " such as the popular @entity9 car sharing service , is gaining in popularity as consumers look to other ways to save money			1
car - sharing services let you avoid paying for gas and insurance , but there are fees and rules			1
by using a car share , you 're not only shedding monthly car payments , taxes , insurance and upkeep , but you can let someone else worry about whether the old rattle trap will make it another year			1
you simply pay a fee and drive the car when you need it			1
by maximizing the utilization of a single automobile among many users , car sharing services claim they are helping to reduce pollution , too			1
every single @entity9 removes about 15 personal cars from the road , the company says			2
unclogging traffic and dialing back the amount of single - occupant vehicles burning fuel has a greening effect			0
reducing expenses and saving the polar ice caps are n't the only reasons ; there 's as much justification for joining a car share as you can dream up , from impressing the client at a business meeting with a fancy car to going over the river and through the woods for family gatherings , all without actually owning a car ( or paying for its gas or insurance )			1
but is a car share for you ? the concept seems best suited to metro areas , where car insurance rates and parking costs can be high			1
on the other hand , if you work out of your car , use it on a daily basis or live in a more rural or expansive suburban region , you might be better off keeping your current car			0
@entity72 autos : @entity74 distracting things people do in their cars " the ideal candidates for car sharing are consumers and businesses in cities where owning a car is costly , where there is good public transit , and where most amenities are within walking distance , " @entity9 president and coo @entity78 said			1
" in other words , where you do n't really need to own a car			2
in addition , students are ideal car sharing members , given the high cost of ownership as well as the increasing limits on parking on campus			0
" @entity72 autos : cheapest cars to own automobiles can be a huge hassle and expense if you only drive occasionally , so we 've set out to look at what car sharing involves			1
@entity72 autos : pay as you drive insurance how does it work ? the biggest @entity112 car share , @entity9 , aims to be convenient , easy , and technologically savvy			1
far more streamlined than an old - school rental car , @entity9 makes getting the use of an automobile about as easy as making a withdrawal from an atm			1
the concept of car sharing had its genesis in @entity121 and has spread to the @entity112 market as interest in frugality and environmental consciousness has increased			0
@entity72 autos : twenty cars of the future the first step to using @entity9 is signing up			2
as a member , you 'll get a " @entity131 , " which allows you to reserve a vehicle near you via the company 's web site or from a new @entity136 application			0
once you 've reserved a car ( or truck -- the beauty of car sharing services is that you can get a big car when you need it , not when you do n't ) , a pretty neat technology unlocks the doors when you walk near your vehicle ( we wo n't bore you with the details , but if you 're wondering , it 's called radio frequency identification )			1
when it senses the card on you , the doors unlock , at which point , you 're on your way			0
cars are located all over metro areas ( @entity9 gives you a map to the location of the car you 've booked )			1
while application approval is usually quick , it takes a few days to get the @entity131 mailed to you			0
if your city has a @entity131 office , you can pick up your card there			0
where can you find car sharing ? car shares are springing up across the @entity166 , but you 're likely to find them in major cities with a traffic problem			1
@entity9 is the largest service of its kind in the @entity166 , maintaining a fleet of 6,500 automobiles that service 300,000 - plus users			1
twenty - eight states have at least one @entity9 outpost , and @entity9 has expanded its user base by 100 percent per year since 2004 , so new service areas will spring up where demand supports it			1
@entity9 also operates in @entity182 , as well as @entity183 in the @entity184			2
the service is strongest on the coasts , with the @entity187 being particularly thick with coverage , but even @entity190 , @entity189 has @entity191 available			0
@entity9 claims that as consumers are moving toward more " access " models ( such as buying music by the song for your mp3 player ) , cars could also move in this direction			2
" car sharing has always represented great value for consumers by giving them the freedom of car ownership without the cost and hassles , " @entity9 's @entity78 said			1
" now more than ever , in an economic recession and with gas prices on the rise , people and businesses are turning to car sharing			2
in addition , in an era where people buy music by the song , driving a car by the hour makes a lot of sense			0
" municipalities often tout car sharing if a service is available			2
check with your city to see if there are any plans to bring car sharing to your city			0

businesses and universities are also in @entity9 's crosshairs , and the @entity9 fleet could save many businesses money on company cars			2
@entity72 autos : rental car prices can change in a heartbeat @entity9 touts its fleet as the most diverse of its kind with everything from @entity283 to pickup trucks			1
there are premium nameplates in @entity9 's fleet that command higher prices -- the cars for the image - conscious versus plain - jane driver			1
full - day rentals are $ 65 , and a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. business day runs $ 56			0
cars come with a full tank of fuel , and you get 180 miles per day before you start paying by the mile			0
other car sharing services @entity9 is n't the only game in town , of course			1
traditional car rental services offer one - way rentals , which @entity9 does not ; this is something to consider depending on your travel plans			1
@entity307 has jumped into the breech with its " @entity307 " product , a veritable clone of @entity9			0
@entity307 only offers its service in five locations so far : @entity313 ; @entity314 , @entity315 ; @entity316 ; @entity317 in @entity318 ; and @entity319 @entity320 has also tossed its hat into the ring with its @entity325 service , mostly based around specific college campuses in a small number of locations			0
@entity325 's rates are higher and terms more restrictive than @entity9 's			0
regional players also abound , most based around a particular region			0
@entity334 residents can use @entity335 , @entity336 has @entity337 , and there are small car sharing services in places like @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , or @entity344			0
rates for these competitors vary from on par to more expensive			0
