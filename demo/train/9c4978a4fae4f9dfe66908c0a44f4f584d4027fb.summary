@entity0 -- @entity3 sailors boarded two aid ships headed to the @entity7 territory of @entity8 on friday , the @entity3 military said			1
while no resistance was reported , activists criticized the @entity3 action as " illegal " and vowed that activists " will keep coming , wave after wave " to try to deliver aid to @entity7 in @entity8			1
activists on board the " @entity23 to @entity8 " mini-flotilla were " attempting to break the maritime security blockade that is in place in accordance with international law , " the @entity3 military said , and were refusing to heed their calls to turn back			1
" the boarding was carried out in line with directives from the @entity3 government and after all attempts to prevent the vessels from reaching the @entity8 were made , but to no avail , " the military said			1
" the boarding was carried out following numerous calls to the activists on board and during different points at sea			0
following their unwillingness to cooperate , and after ignoring calls to divert to the port of @entity42 , the decision was made to board the vessels and lead them there			1
" sailors " took every precaution necessary to ensure the safety of the activists on board the vessels as well as themselves , " the @entity45 said			0
activists will be handed over to @entity3 police and immigration authorities , the military said			1
according to the activist organizers , this mission was the eleventh attempt to run @entity3 's blockade of @entity8 by sea			1
five missions arrived safely in @entity8 between august and december 2008 , with the rest intercepted by @entity3			1
the activists said friday that " ground support crews lost contact with two ships , the @entity67 of @entity68 and the @entity69 of @entity70			2
" it said there are 27 civilian passengers			0
the boats are carrying medical supplies and letters of support for people in @entity8			0
the activists said the navy interrogated people on the @entity69 around 7:30 a.m. , when it was about 48 nautical miles from the @entity8 coast			0
thirteen minutes later , ground support crews lost contact with two ships			0
asked by the @entity3 navy for their destination , @entity70 activist @entity85 replied , " the conscience of humanity , " the activists ' said in a statement			1
when they repeated the question , asking for final destination , @entity85 said , " the betterment of mankind			0
" kit @entity97 , an @entity99 traveling with the @entity69 , said @entity3 made contact with the group and told them to change their radio channel			2
@entity97 said the group declined to do so			0
late thursday , two @entity3 navy ships shadowed the ships before pulling back , the group said			1
the activists said the ships had been " illegally boarded			2
" " it 's clear that 27 civilians on two small boats , carrying only medicine , constituted no security threat to the @entity3 state , and that the determination to keep them out is only a furtherance of @entity3 's policy of collective punishment , a crime against humanity , " said @entity110 , spokeswoman for @entity23 to @entity8			2
" despite this @entity3 aggression , we will keep coming , wave after wave , by air , sea , and land , to challenge @entity3 's illegal policies towards @entity8 and all of @entity132 , " @entity110 said			2
" our movement will not stop or be stopped until @entity132 is free			0
" @entity134 , @entity99 coordinator for the @entity23 to @entity8 flotilla , said , " had the passengers been permitted to proceed to @entity8 rather than being stopped on the high seas by armed force , there would have been no threat to their safety			0
the @entity45 's statement is like the mugger promising to escort his victim home safely			0
" @entity147 , one of the organizers of the @entity149 that attempted to sail to @entity8 last june , said , " it 's a little hard to imagine how 27 unarmed civilians on two small boats carrying medicine and letters threaten @entity3 's security			2
@entity3 is simply determined to maintain its policy of collective punishment against the 1.6 million civilians in @entity8			2
this is a crime against humanity and violation of international law			0
despite @entity3 's consistent use of military force against nonviolent protests and demonstrations , activists around the world will continue to challenge the occupation of @entity132 and the blockade and @entity8			1
" passengers on the boats are from @entity70 , @entity174 , the @entity99 , @entity175 , and the @entity7 territories , the activists say			0
the flotillas have sparked international controversy			0
in 2010 , an @entity3 raid on one flotilla ship , the @entity180 , resulted in nine @entity182 activists being killed , a development that led to the deterioration of relations between @entity3 and @entity182 , once close allies			1
@entity3 was roundly criticized by many over the deaths			2
a @entity190 report criticized @entity3 for its use of excessive force in the incident but described the blockade -- which activists call illegal -- as a " legitimate security measure			1
" @entity3 says it is concerned about the smuggling of arms to @entity8 militants intent on attacking the jewish state			0
@entity8 is controlled by the anti-israel @entity202 militant group , regarded as a terrorist group by the @entity99 and @entity3 , but activists say @entity3 embargoes of goods into @entity8 from land and sea are collective punishment of civilians in what is a tiny and densely populated strip of land along the @entity215 coast			1
@entity3 has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to @entity8 can do so in coordination with @entity3 authorities via existing land crossings into the @entity7 territory			1
@entity1 's @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report .			0

activists are from different countries
the ships will be diverted to the @entity42 port , @entity3 says
activists will be transferred to the *custody* of @entity3 authorities
