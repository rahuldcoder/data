-- ten years ago , @entity1 was studying ballet and piano , not flying through the air with a pair of skis on her feet			2
but since she discovered the sport of ski jumping at age 8 , the @entity9 teen has been poised to make @entity14 history			1
@entity1 will compete in the first - ever women 's ski jump event at the @entity17			1
at 17 , she 's already made a name for herself in the sport , winning a record 19 @entity20 since the women 's @entity23 series was established in 2011			1
it 's been a long battle for female ski jumpers to see their sport on the global stage			0
in 2006 , the @entity30 rejected a request to include women 's ski jumping in the 2010 @entity34			1
several high - profile female ski jumpers sued the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , which ended with a court determining the @entity36 had , in fact , committed gender discrimination			0
however , the ruling did not require the committee to include the sport , and the dream of a 2010 women 's competition disintegrated			0
now , in @entity45 , @entity1 and her fellow competitors will mark a watershed moment , and @entity1 's hometown of @entity49 is cheering her on			0
according to the town 's mayor , @entity54 , hundreds of pink banners and flags bearing the name " @entity53 " adorn the city			0
her potential victory is important to them for many reasons : she would bridge ( or jump ? ) a gender gap ; she would end @entity9 's long @entity63 drought ( the country has won only one gold medal since the @entity66 in @entity67 ) ; and she would help position @entity9 as a ski jumping powerhouse			1
it 's a lot of pressure for someone so young , but @entity74 -- and the female ski jumping community -- is ready to win			0
@entity1 will compete in the women 's normal hill event on tuesday .			2
