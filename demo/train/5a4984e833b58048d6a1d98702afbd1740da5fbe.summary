-- @entity1 thought @entity2 wanted to see him about " @entity3 " because of his singing and dancing skills			1
but the legendary studio founder had something else in mind			2
@entity1 played @entity3 the chimney sweep in " @entity3			1
" " he had heard me in an interview talking about what was happening to family entertainment , " says @entity1 in a phone interview , still amused by the memory			1
" i was decrying the fact that it seemed like no holds were barred anymore in entertainment			2
... that 's why he called me in , because i said something he agreed with			1
" @entity2 , after years of cajoling " @entity3 " author @entity23 , was finally mounting a production of the books about a magical nanny			1
with @entity1 , he knew he was also getting a star as well as a like - minded performer			1
the actor 's tv sitcom , " the @entity32 , " was a steady hit at the time , and he had won a @entity34 for his work in the stage version of " @entity37			1
" with @entity1 as the @entity44 chimney sweep @entity3 , fellow @entity34 winner @entity38 ( in her movie debut ) as @entity3 and several old pros in tow , @entity2 went ahead with production on the 1964 film , which was to become one of the biggest hits his studio ever produced			1
the movie earned five @entity50 -- including a best actress win for @entity38 -- and its @entity53 and @entity54 songs , such as " supercalifragilisticexpialidocious , " " @entity56 " and the @entity50 - winning " @entity57 , " have become standards			1
forty - five years later , " @entity3 " is also a hit stage show , with excerpts of the @entity62 production featured on a new 45th - anniversary dvd			1
@entity1 , 83 , took a few minutes to talk about the film , his much - maligned @entity65 and @entity67 's fondness for his old tv show			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			2
@entity0 : tell me about @entity2			2
people think of him as a brand name nowadays , but he was a real person and still alive when you made the film			2
was he a presence on the set ? @entity1 : absolutely			1
he was very much into this and believed in it			2
he hung around the set a lot			2
and i 'm happy to say he was so pleased with the way it was going , as we all were			2
@entity0 : how did you end up with the part of @entity3 ? @entity1 : well , i thought he hired me because i was such a great singer and dancer			1
as it turns out , he had heard me in an interview talking about what was happening to family entertainment			2
i was decrying the fact that it seemed like no holds were barred anymore in entertainment			2
... he knew about the " @entity32 , " about our little sitcom , but that 's why he called me in , because i said something he agreed with			2
and i got the part			0
@entity0 : " the @entity32 " was still on at the time			0
were you balancing the " @entity109 " at the same time you did " @entity3 , " or were you on hiatus ? @entity1 : it was on hiatus			1
that whole decade of the ' 60s , that 's what i did for 10 years -- i did the show and then a movie , a show and then a movie			1
i felt i 'd better make hay while the sun shined			0
... it always worked out pretty well			0
but i found myself getting up in the morning and taking off on the freeway and forgetting where in the hell i was supposed to go , and a couple times i showed up at the wrong studio			0
@entity0 : you 've taken a lot of ribbing over the years for your @entity44 accent			1
@entity1 : oh , have i ever			1
@entity0 : did @entity38 or @entity130 [ who played mr. @entity131 ] mention things to you about the accent ? or did they just go with the flow ? @entity1 : they just went with the flow ! it 's funny -- i was concentrating on the dancing , mostly , and they had given me a [ voice ] coach who turned out to be an @entity144 , and his @entity44 was n't much better than mine			1
during the making of the picture nobody kidded me about the accent , but i sure took it afterwards			2
[ one @entity150 poll named @entity1 's accent the second - worst @entity150 accent ever ; @entity1 observes , however , that he was beaten out by @entity154 's " untouchables " performance			1
] @entity0 : tell me about the way the movie was shot			0
there were a lot of scenes with animated characters , and today those would be shot with a blue screen or computer animation			0
@entity1 : i think it 's such a shame that @entity2 did n't live to see computer animation , because he would have had a good time with it			1
... in those days it was before the blue screen			0
they used what was called yellow sulphur lighting -- the screen was yellow , and we worked with that all day , and by the time the day was over you could n't see anything			0
... it was just an empty soundstage			0
and sometimes we did n't even have the music -- we would just dance to a click rhythm			0
but i think technically it holds up today just as well as anything			0
@entity0 : did you know what some of the animated sequences were going to be ? @entity1 : yes , that was in the script			1
but i had to go to @entity2 and talk him into letting me do the old [ bank president ]			0
i said , i 'll do that part and i wo n't even charge you			0
so he made me do a little screen test and gave me the part			0
... and he did n't pay me -- i had to donate $ 4,000 to his @entity194 school			0
he was a little horse trader			0
@entity0 : you worked with @entity197 in the film , and i know you 're a huge fan of the old comedians			0
what was @entity197 like ? @entity1 : he was in his [ late 70s ] at the time , and not very well			1
he did all that " @entity202 " stuff hanging from the ceiling , and it was just so hard on him , but he was a trouper			0
he was a sweet old guy			0
he had a palsy -- his head would move from side to side , kind of involuntarily			0
but the minute they would say " action , " it would stop			0
and he 'd do the scene , and the minute they said " cut , " it would start in again			0
@entity0 : let me change gears			0
@entity67 has said that " the @entity32 " is one of her favorite shows			1
@entity1 : i 've heard that , and i sent them a note and said , " thank you for making me famous all over again			1
" i call them the black @entity224 and @entity225			0
@entity0 : is it nice that so much of your work has had longevity ? @entity1 : i just lucked into working with geniuses like [ " @entity109 " creator ] @entity232 and @entity2			1
i just lucked out .			0
