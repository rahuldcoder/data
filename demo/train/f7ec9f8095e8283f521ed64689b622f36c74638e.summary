-- it 's the time of year for dashing through the snow to the crowded post office , with arms full of holiday gifts for family and friends			2
not to break the atmosphere of holiday cheer , but this @entity10 could be the last for the @entity11			1
it is losing $ 25 million dollars a day and staring down insolvency -- unless @entity14 steps in to pass a reform package that reduces its costs			1
with just a few days left in the congressional calendar , there is still some small hope for a @entity10 miracle -- maybe the @entity11 can be saved as part of a deal on the fiscal cliff			1
but with even @entity26 relief stalled , skepticism is growing			0
the real question is , what 's taken them so long ? after all , back in april the @entity30 passed an imperfect but bipartisan bill by 62 - 37			0
it would have saved some $ 20 billion , cut some 100 distribution centers , and reduced head count by an additional 100,000 through incentives for early retirement , while reducing red tape to encourage entrepreneurialism and keeping saturday delivery in place for at least another two years			0
at the time , sen. @entity43 of @entity44 said , " the situation is not hopeless ; the situation is dire			0
my hope is that our friends over in the @entity48 , given the bipartisan steps we took this week , will feel a sense of urgency			1
" to which the @entity48 might as well have replied , " not so much			0
" in august , the @entity11 defaulted for the first time , unable to make a $ 5.5 billion payment to fund future retirees ' health benefits			1
the headline in @entity59 magazine said it all : " @entity11 defaults , @entity14 does nothing			1
" the usual suspects were at fault -- hyperpartisan politics and the ideological arrogance that always makes the perfect the enemy of the good			0
@entity70 chairman @entity69 greeted the news of the @entity30 bill by calling it a " taxpayer - funded bailout			0
" his primary complaint was that the @entity30 bill did not go far enough			0
he was not alone -- postmaster general @entity76 also expressed disappointment at the scope of the @entity30 bill , saying that it fell " far short of the @entity11 's plan			1
" but @entity69 's alternative could n't even get to a vote in the @entity83 - controlled @entity48			0
even after the @entity11 defaulted on a second $ 5.5 billion payment , the response was crickets			1
@entity89 insiders said that action would be taken after the election , when lawmakers would be free to make potentially unpopular decisions			1
but despite a series of closed - door meetings , nothing has been done			0
it 's possible that the nearly $ 20 billion in savings could be part of a fiscal cliff deal			1
sen. @entity101 has suggested that ending saturday delivery , except for packages , could be part of a compromise that could save big bucks down the road			0
another aspect of a savings plan could be suspending the @entity11 ' onerous obligation to fully fund its pension costs upfront , a requirement that would push many businesses into bankruptcy			1
and last fiscal year , the post office posted a record $ 15.9 billion loss			0
" as the nation creeps toward the ' fiscal cliff , ' the @entity11 is clearly marching toward a financial collapse of its own , " says @entity43			1
" @entity121 's financial crisis is growing worse , not better			0
it is imperative that @entity14 get to work on this issue and find a solution immediately			2
... recently key @entity48 and @entity30 leaders on postal reform have had productive discussions on a path forward , and while there may be some differences of opinion in some of the policy approaches needed to save the @entity11 , there is broad agreement that reform needs to happen -- the sooner the better			1
" the urgency could n't be clearer -- but even at this yuletide 11th hour , signs of progress are slim to none			0
if @entity14 fails to pass a bill , we 'll be back to square one in the new year , with the @entity30 needing to pass a new bill which will then have to be ratified by the @entity48			2
there is just no rational reason to think that lift will be any easier in the next @entity14 than in the current lame duck @entity14 , where our elected officials are supposedly more free to do the right thing , freed from electoral consequences			2
so as you crowd your local post office this holiday season , look around and realize that the clock is ticking			0
the @entity11 is fighting for its life			2
and @entity14 seems determined to ignore its cries for help			2
" neither rain nor snow nor sleet nor gloom of night " can stop the @entity11 from making its appointed rounds -- but congressional division and dysfunction apparently can			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

the @entity11 is *bleeding* money and heading toward insolvency
@entity168 : @entity14 can save the postal service in deal on the fiscal cliff
he says the urgency is clear , let 's hope for a @entity10 miracle
@entity168 : but be prepared that @entity89 dysfunction can doom the postal service
