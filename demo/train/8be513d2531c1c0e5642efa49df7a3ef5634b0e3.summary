@entity0 , @entity1 -- with a steady hand , @entity1 @entity5 volunteer @entity3 , 22 , measures out chlorine powder , adds it to a large bucket of water and begins to stir			1
this will eventually reach some of the 100,000 displaced people in @entity12 who have been forced from their homes after violence swept through their communities in 2012			1
@entity16 : what 's behind sectarian violence in @entity1 ? in the town of @entity0 , the violence has divided the once peaceful ethnic @entity12 and @entity22 communities , turning friends into enemies and driving neighbors into exile			1
at first glance the town appears peaceful , and the streets are bustling with people visiting shops and restaurants			0
but just a short drive from the town center the landscape alters with relief camps and ngo vehicles , the telltale sign that we are reaching our destination			0
@entity42 camp houses 573 people from ethnic @entity12 communities in temporary bamboo shelters			1
the @entity5 is bringing in drinking water as part of its emergency relief program that distributes 8,000 liters of safe water to camps each day			1
the water is a lifeline for the people living in this camp			1
one of the residents tells me that despite other water tanks nearby , this is the only water safe for drinking			2
terrorized , starving and homeless : @entity1 's @entity60 still forgotten the cool weather in @entity0 is a shock after the oppressive heat of @entity64 where we are based			2
people in the camps tell me they are already concerned about flooding when it rains			2
the tattered sandbags piled outside shelters do little to prevent the muddy , dirty water from flowing inside			0
in a few more months the rainy season will arrive in earnest			0
will these families still be here ? we visit a @entity22 camp situated further out of the main town			1
because of the violence and continued tensions , the camps are divided to separately house the ethnic @entity12 and @entity22 communities			1

@entity5 volunteers inside are treating @entity92 , 14 , who was in a cycling accident			2
his bandaged ankle covers a series of severe cuts , and he winces , as the volunteers carefully take off the bandage to clean and dress the wounds			0
the @entity5 is supporting health clinics in more than 10 camps , treating patients from both communities			1
the need for these services is evident			0
mothers are clutching babies with skin complaints , and men with bandaged arms are leaning against the fragile bamboo shelter			0
in this dusty and crowded camp , cuts and grazes can quickly become infected , and with limited toilets and a lack of sanitation facilities , diseases can quickly spread			1
the @entity5 has built toilets and wells in this camp to help respond to some of the health and sanitation challenges			1
volunteers have the unenviable task of regularly disinfecting the toilets with chlorine powder			0
the @entity5 team has been drafted from other parts of the country to help respond to substantial needs			2

the conditions are basic , the work is hard , but there are no complaints			0
soon a new rotation will arrive , and these teammates will return home , back to their communities , jobs and normal day - to - day lives -- an impossible reality now for the thousands of displaced families in @entity12			2
the humanitarian crisis in @entity12 first erupted in june 2012 , meaning many of the families we have met over the last few days have been living in camps for up to seven months			1
as time passes , greater priority is being placed on providing adequate temporary shelters for families unable to return home			0
several hundred " long houses " -- temporary shelters which house eight to 10 families -- have already been built			0
these shelters can be seen in some of the camps we visited , but there are still not enough for the entire displaced population			0
in the coming months the @entity1 @entity5 plans to support the construction of up to 160 temporary shelters			0
while the longterm solutions to this crisis remain unclear , the need for drinking water , food , shelter and medical care are very evident			1
as dislocated families continue to cope with life away from home and their livelihoods , it is critical that humanitarian assistance continues to reach people in both @entity12 and @entity22 communities .			1
