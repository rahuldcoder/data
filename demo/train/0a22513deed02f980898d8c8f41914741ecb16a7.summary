@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sweet fragrance of a thousand sticks of burning incense curls into reverent smoke clouds on this lucky night of the new moon			1
we are inside @entity0 's oldest temple , @entity10 , deeply immersed in the history and traditions of this chaotic , modern city in @entity1			1
on the first and 15th night of each lunar month , @entity14 , @entity15 and worshipers of the ancient goddess of the sea , @entity19 , gather here to pray , bring food and flowers and share the wonders of their faiths			1
it has been the same here twice a month , almost every month , for 274 years			0
immigrants from @entity32 's @entity31 province built this ornate temple in 1738 during the @entity34			1
it has been damaged by earthquakes , storms and war but restored numerous times			0
as with many @entity42 temples , it has three decorated gates , one inside the next			1
in the first courtyard is a waterfall , a point of ablution that recalls the water wells outside mosques , the baptismal waters of @entity51 and even more ancient , the washing spring at the base of @entity55 's great @entity54 at @entity56			1
carved , richly painted dragons guard the entrances			0
inside the main chamber is an explosion of brilliant color			2
tonight , there are the people -- hundreds of them , from every section and class of this society			0
they hold incense between their clasped hands or with their hands open flat and pressed against one another in front of their chest or against their forehead , facing toward an altar or a richly decorated table , bowing and praying			0
when they are finished , they place the incense into huge gold pots , many decorated with religious figurines			2
some set bright candles alight on massive candelabra			0
the ceilings are rich with gold			0
on the walls hang signs with ancient poetry			2
long tables are filled with food , which those who have brought it later eat to imbibe the blessings the food has absorbed			0
everywhere there are flowers , thousands of flowers			0
just outside are the teeming streets of @entity0 -- the bustle of the @entity10 metro station , the chaotic tastes of the @entity100 night market , the strange sights of @entity102 , and the overwhelming crowds and commercialism of the @entity106 shopping district			1
beyond the horizon , the mainland 's missiles -- said to number in the hundreds -- poised to arrive in just seven minutes			2
but inside @entity10 , all that curls away			1
for the hundreds of believers who gather here , for these few minutes , on this night of luck and wonder , there is just the path , reverent peace and a connection with history that stays with the visitor long after the next morning dawns			1
location : no. 211 guangzhou street , @entity127 , @entity0 hours : 6:00 a.m. -10:20 p.m. admission : free getting there : driving the circuitous streets of inner - city @entity0 is not for the faint - hearted , and parking can be challenge			1
instead , take the @entity133 ( subway ) to @entity135			0
the temple is across the street			2
alternately , take the mtr to @entity138			0
the temple is about four blocks north .			2

a visit to @entity0 's @entity10 on a lucky night provides a *cultural* window
the faithful of several religious traditions gather to pray
the chaos of the modern city outside fades away inside the walls of the temple
