-- police in @entity4 have detained three people in the mysterious disappearance of 12 people from a nightclub , the city 's attorney general said			1
and for the first time since the disappearance , attorney general @entity9 confirmed there is evidence showing that the people who are missing had indeed been at the club			1
the names of the detainees -- one woman and two waiters from the @entity20 after bar -- were not released			2
officials said they are looking at the link between the woman and the waiters , but did not say what charges , if any , they might face			2
before tuesday 's announcement , the relatives of the missing people -- one of them only 16 years old -- insisted that they had been kidnapped from the after - hours bar in @entity4 's @entity33 entertainment district			1
but police had said there was no proof that that the 12 had even been there			1
" there is evidence that the majority of the youths arrived at @entity42 in two vehicles , one private and a taxi , but it is unknown how they left , " @entity9 said			0
still , he said , there is no evidence that an armed convoy snatched the group , as the families say			0
the attorney general also upped the number of missing to 12 from 11 , saying that another family had come forward			2
the top prosecutor met with the families of the missing to give them an update			0
" we are not interested in who took them , we are not interested in any of that , whether they will be punished , or not punished does n't interest us , " said @entity60 , the father of one of the missing			0
" our interest is that they all return alive			0
" not all of the 12 people said to be involved knew each other , but most of them hail from the @entity74 neighborhood , a place known for its rough character			1
that alone has added spice to an already sensational story , leading to speculation that gangs could be involved			0
the young people were taken from the @entity20 after nightclub on sunday , may 26 , between 10 a.m. and noon , family members say			1
they were forced into a van and kidnapped , they claim			2
a center for missing persons in @entity4 will distribute photos and information about the missing young people across the country			1
a mass kidnapping would be a significant development because even through the years of drug cartel violence , the capital was a relatively safe place			0
recently , however , there is evidence that infighting between local criminal groups is on the rise			0
more than 26,000 people have gone missing in @entity4 over the past six years as violence surged and the country 's government cracked down on drug cartels , according to @entity4 's @entity107			1
authorities do n't have data on how many of the disappearances were connected with organized crime .			0

three people have been detained in connection with the disappearance of 12 people
police have not said why these three were detained
the 12 young people were *allegedly* kidnapped from a bar in @entity4
