the @entity1 scandal has claimed collateral damage : the president of the @entity6 's @entity5 chapter			1
@entity7 resigned thursday , after the civil rights group came under fire for its plans to present a lifetime achievement award to the @entity13 owner			0
meanwhile on friday , @entity1 's purported girlfriend said through her attorney she was merely a platonic friend , with no sexual relationship with the @entity18 team owner			1
@entity1 is accused of making racist comments against african - americans in an audio recording that surfaced last weekend that purportedly depict an argument between @entity1 and @entity23			1
on friday , @entity1 was quoted on @entity24 as saying " i wish i had just paid her off " in reference to @entity23			1
the site , which specified that @entity1 was referring to @entity23 in a discussion with one of its writers , did n't state when the remark was made			1
@entity1 is n't the only one reeling in the controversy			1
the uproar also struck one of the nation 's leading civil rights groups , the @entity6 , whose @entity5 chapter rescinded monday its offer to give @entity39 a lifetime achievement honor once @entity1 's racist remarks came to light			1
but that reversal was apparently too late			0
the outcry was too much for the group			0
" please be advised that the legacy , history and reputation of the @entity6 is more important to me than the presidency , " @entity7 said , in announcing his resignation			0
he said he was stepping down to separate the organization from the " negative exposure i have caused			1
" @entity54 's highest honor the lifetime achievement award is the @entity6 's highest honor			2
the @entity58 chapter presented @entity1 with the award in 2009 , and was planning to do so again this month			2
@entity1 had donated a substantial amount of money to the chapter in the last few years			2
some reports put it around $ 45,000			0
earlier this week , the @entity18 's commissioner came down hard on @entity39 , ordering him out of his team 's business and pushing to force him to sell over the remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public last weekend			1
the inflammatory sentiments came packaged in a 10 - minute recording that @entity72 said occurred during an april 9 conversation between @entity39 and girlfriend @entity23			1
on the recording , a man and woman argue about photos posted to @entity77 in which she appears with african - americans			0
the man says he does n't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her			0
the sports website @entity85 posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording			0
' giving away integrity ' the @entity6 and @entity1 were n't strangers , and the group had honored @entity1 before , an analyst said			2
" the first time @entity1 was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the group was in the midst of a lawsuit for housing discrimination based upon race , " said @entity94 , a @entity96 contributor and lecturer at @entity98			2
" to decide to honor him with the award a second time , after he had paid millions to settle multiple discrimination suits ... is not selling out			2
selling out makes financial sense			0
no , considering what $ 45,000 means to a man of @entity1 's wealth , honoring him with awards is just giving integrity away			1
" the billionaire real estate mogul has found himself in hot water in the past , denying in court accusations of discrimination tied to the @entity18 team and to property he owns			0
a ' social price ' to pay soon after the scandal broke , @entity7 did n't seem inclined to cut ties with @entity1			2
" at some point when there has been proof , i think that would be a legitimate time for the @entity6 to sit down with @entity1 and try to work out how and why he did what he did and what is he going to do in the future , " he said			2
" @entity132 teaches us to forgive			0
and the way i look at it , after a sustained period of just proof to the @entity138 - @entity138 community that those words do n't really reflect his heart , i think there 's room for forgiveness			0
" by monday , @entity7 had changed course			0
" the revelation that mr. @entity1 may have made comments in a phone conversation that were reminiscent of an ugly time period in @entity138 history that contained elements of segregation and racial discrimination demands that the @entity6 intention to honor mr. @entity1 for his lifetime body of work must be withdrawn , and his donation to the @entity5 @entity6 returned , " the group said monday when it withdrew its invitation			1
" there is a personal , economic and social price that mr. @entity1 must pay for his attempt to turn the clock back on race relations			2
" ' girlfriend ' says she was just a pal on friday , @entity23 's lawyer said his client was n't @entity1 's girlfriend			1
rather , @entity23 was a platonic friend , said attorney @entity167			1
" my client was not @entity1 's mistress or girlfriend			1
we have proof that there was no sexual relationship , " @entity167 said			0
" they were more like friends			0
" when asked why gave @entity1 her such lavish gifts as expensive cars , the attorney said : " because he cares about her			1
" @entity167 also stated that @entity23 did n't distribute the recorded conservation			0
" she did not leak the recordings , " the attorney said			0
" we are narrowing down who might have leaked the tapes , but we do not want to divulge at this point			0
" @entity23 does n't have a book deal connected to the @entity1 controversy , @entity167 said			2
" there is no book deal			0
she 's been writing a book , but not about @entity1			1
it 's about her life , " @entity167 said			0
@entity23 used to work in a crime victims unit in a district attorney 's office , @entity167 added			2
" when the truth comes out , whoever has been calling her ' gold digger ' and ' con artist ' will have to retract that -- absolutely false , " @entity167 said			0
in march , @entity1 's wife sued @entity23 , accusing her having an affair with the billionaire team owner			1
in the lawsuit , @entity209 accuses @entity23 of targeting extremely wealthy older men			0
the suit claims that @entity1 used the couple 's money to buy @entity23 a @entity215 , two @entity216 and a @entity217			1
@entity23 also took over a $ 1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $ 250,000 in cash from @entity1 , the court document claims			1
@entity23 fought back , saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with @entity1 giving her gifts			2
she also said she never took advantage of the @entity13 owner , who made much of his fortune in real estate			0
sterling no stranger to lawsuits this is n't the first time the @entity39 have been involved in a lawsuit			1
@entity235 , who was executive vice president and general manager of the @entity13 from 1986 to 2008 , filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination against @entity39 in 2009 , saying that the team 's owner underpaid him and treated him " as a token because of his race			1
" @entity1 denied those accusations and said the team acted within its rights and " for good cause and not for any improper reason			2
" before the case went to trial , @entity249 dropped the racial discrimination claim but maintained accusations of age discrimination			0
a jury sided with @entity1 in 2011			2
the @entity256 filed a lawsuit in 2006 accusing @entity39 's rental company of refusing to lease @entity260 apartments to african - americans , refusing to rent to non-koreans in the @entity264 section of @entity265 and turning away families with children from its properties			1
that case was settled in 2009 , with @entity1 agreeing to pay nearly $ 3 million but continuing to deny the accusations			2
then there was a 2003 lawsuit in which the nonprofit @entity273 and a group of tenants who lived in @entity1 's properties accused him of " numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices , " according to court documents			1
among other claims , his accusers said @entity1 told building staff that he did not like @entity284 or @entity138 - @entity138 tenants and that he preferred @entity286 - @entity138 tenants and made " disparaging comments " about @entity138 and @entity284 tenants			1
@entity1 , according to court documents , " vehemently denied " the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of " being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas			0
" the case was dismissed in 2005 after a settlement was reached			0
details of the deal were not disclosed			0
one of his former tenants , @entity300 , videotaped @entity1 's wife going door - to - door at the building			1
over a decade later , @entity300 says he 's still mystified about what happened and about @entity1 himself			1
" we rent his buildings , support his basketball team , play on his teams , " said @entity300 , who is @entity138			0
" but he 's oblivious to that			0
