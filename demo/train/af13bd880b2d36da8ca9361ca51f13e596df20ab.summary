@entity0 -- a 13th - century painting that was up for auction by @entity4 is now in the hands of the @entity7 government after it was determined to have allegedly been stolen from a safe deposit box in @entity9 in 1986 , according to court documents			1
@entity4 's listed " @entity13 , " an oil - on - panel painting , for sale in january and estimated the painting would bring between $ 600,000 and $ 800,000 , according to @entity4 's spokesperson @entity15			1
shortly after the listing , @entity4 's performed its regular background check on the piece and discovered that it was in a database of stolen art , according to a @entity4 's statement to @entity1 wednesday			1
@entity4 's says it " immediately and voluntarily " removed the painting from auction and has " cooperated fully with the investigation			1
" the painting is described as being on an engraved background , decorated with gold , dating from about 1285 to 1290			0
@entity4 's had described it as sharing " an affinity with models by @entity35 " ( a painter of that time from the @entity31 city of @entity32 ) but concluded that it was more likely the work of a @entity38 painter influenced by @entity39 ( a pioneer in the @entity42 style who was a contemporary of @entity35 ) , according to documents cited in a forfeiture complaint filed this week in the @entity48 @entity7 attorney 's office			2
the artwork is primarily referred to as the " @entity35 painting " in the complaint			2
in 1977 , according to the complaint , the painting , which at the time was jointly owned by a man and a woman , was deposited in a safe deposit box in @entity58 , @entity9			0
the woman died in 1980 and her heirs designated another man to represent their interests in the painting			0
in 1986 , the two men moved the painting to a new safety deposit box in another bank branch , according to the complaint			2
soon after , one of the co-owners gave a percentage of his ownership to two other men			0
those two reported that the co-owner had again moved the artwork , but they did not know the whereabouts of the painting or the co-owner , according to the complaint			2
an @entity82 investigation began in 1991 , but the painting was never found until it turned up listed on @entity4 's for auction earlier this year , according to the complaint			1
@entity4 's would not respond to @entity1 for comment on how the auction house obtained the artwork			1
anyone who claims to have any rights to the painting must appear and show reasons to establish the claim , according to the federal complaint			0
@entity1 was unable to contact any parties who once had ownership			0
