-- last month i joined @entity2 to watch the @entity3 and @entity4 at the @entity5 , and i became immersed in the excitement of a great @entity8 game			1
my excitement would later turn into disappointment and anger as a result of the controversial statements made by @entity3 owner @entity14			1
all of his statements are troubling , but his most recent -- that @entity2 has n't done anything to help the black community -- is just dead wrong			1
that @entity14 -- who has until may 27 to respond to the @entity8 's charges and efforts to terminate his ownership rights -- equates help with handouts shows his flawed and outdated understanding of charity and philanthropy			1
while @entity14 gave an inconsequential amount of cash to the @entity30 chapter of the @entity31 to help dilute his well - documented record of racism , @entity2 used his millions to bring economic development to struggling black communities , to create businesses and jobs , to encourage black entrepreneurship and to inspire other black businessmen and businesswomen to invest in inner cities			1
the protracted discourse this country has been having about race and the @entity8 offers a real opportunity to foster a more long - term solution to the economic disparity in black communities			1
the @entity8 and players should work together to create more pathways to team ownership and more business opportunities across the league 's supply chain for african - americans and other minorities			0
this would be good not only for the league and players , but for minority businesses , fans , and the many youngsters who aspire to sports careers			2
i ca n't think of a better person to help lead such efforts than @entity2			1
what @entity14 does n't understand , but @entity2 does , is that " help " in the 21st century economy is about investing in people and communities so that they can become economically empowered			1
it 's about providing opportunities that can make individuals more financially independent and make black families more financially solvent			2
it 's about creating businesses that bring money into black communities , and keeping the money there			1
opinion : the 5 apology rules that @entity14 broke unlike many professional athletes , @entity2 has always understood the economic impact of sports and sought to extend his financial clout to the broader community			1
as he said in a recent interview with @entity0 's @entity88 , " my whole life is devoted to urban @entity90			2
we go back and educate others on how they can be successful			0
it 's not about giving them money			2
it 's about giving them tools			0
" whether through real estate investments , @entity99 , restaurants , fitness centers , sports teams or @entity104 franchises , @entity2 has been transforming urban centers and in doing so may attract other businesses that wrote off black communities and their buying power			1
over the last three decades , startups by entrepreneurs -- companies less than five years old -- have accounted for most of the new jobs in the private sector			0
arguably , the scarcity of these new , dynamic , fast - growing companies in black communities has contributed to some of the chronic unemployment we see today , the very joblessness that often lies at the root of so many of our broader social problems , from drug dealing and gang violence to neighborhood decay and broken families			2
these challenges defy easy solutions			0
however , a new corner store here or a barbershop there ca n't create widespread economic opportunity			2
targeted government programs can help , but long - term , private - sector investment is absolutely critical for economic sustainability			0
@entity2 understood early on the business of basketball			1
he leveraged his relationships and successfully made the transition from athlete to entrepreneur			0
he is an important role model to youngsters who are eager to be successful in sports but clueless about how to get there			0
opinion : @entity150 apology was an epic fail i witnessed firsthand the sway that @entity2 had as a surrogate during the 2008 presidential race , when i was a senior adviser to the @entity157 campaign , coordinating the involvement of many athletes and entertainers			1
young people responded enthusiastically to @entity2 , energized by their hero and the prospect of a young black president who played ball himself			1
few of these young people will become @entity8 players , but lots can own businesses			0
@entity2 represents an important nexus between the little boys who play on the neighborhood basketball courts and the big boys who play on @entity174			2
his entrepreneurship represents the bridge from poverty to prosperity			0
other professional athletes can build bridges , too , but they have to see themselves as modern - day entrepreneurs with real power to make a difference , as comfortable speaking in corporate boardrooms as they are playing ball , and as interested in owning businesses as they are in being big - ticket consumers with expensive homes and cars			0
the @entity8 generates over $ 4 billion annually and the top 10 players reportedly earn a combined $ 200 million dollars combined each year			0
with that kind of money they can afford to invest in high - growth companies in energy , technology and advanced manufacturing that create high paying jobs			0
athletes also can challenge companies whose products they endorse to locate manufacturing and distribution facilities in distressed urban areas			0
while they 're at it , they should certainly work towards pooling their resources , buying teams , and ensuring a culture of diversity , integrity and mutual respect			0
unlike @entity14 's shameful and insincere attempts to buy credibility in the black community , that 's something the players ' millions can actually attain			1
join us on @entity219 / @entity218 .			0

@entity221 says @entity2 has put his money where his mouth is in the urban *market*
@entity14 criticized @entity2 : " what does he do for the black people ? he does n't do anything . "
@entity14 , says @entity221 , is just dead wrong
@entity2 has invested in real estate , theaters , restaurants , sports teams and @entity104 franchises
