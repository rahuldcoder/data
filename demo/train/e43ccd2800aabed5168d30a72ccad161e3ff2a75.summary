-- @entity1 is reeling after a gun rampage at a small religious college left seven people dead			2
six months ago , eight people died in a shooting in @entity7 , @entity8			2
and just over a year ago , an attack targeting rep. @entity10 in @entity11 left six dead and 13 injured			0
each mass killing provokes a flurry of public shock and a frenzy of media attention -- and often soul - searching about whether they represent a broader descent into gun - fueled violence			2
but are such attacks on the rise in the @entity22 ? not according to professor @entity23 , a criminologist at @entity24 in @entity25 who has been studying mass murder for the past three decades			1
police search for gun used in @entity1 college shooting despite the huge media coverage devoted to them , crime statistics show that there is no upward trend in mass killings -- defined as having four victims or more , not counting terrorism -- since the 1970s , he said			1
campus shootings , such as the @entity40 in 2007 , or the cluster of school shootings of the 1990s , including @entity43 , often attract more attention than multiple killings in other settings			1
at @entity48 , 23 - year - old student @entity47 took 32 lives in a solo shooting spree on the @entity52 campus before killing himself			2
in 1999 at @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , 18 - year - old @entity56 and 17 - year - old @entity56 killed 12 of their fellow students and a teacher before taking their own lives in the school library			2
but despite these high - profile cases , the chances of falling victim to a school or campus shooting are still incredibly slim , @entity23 said			1
" overall in this country , there is an average of 10 to 20 murders across campuses in any given year , " he said			0
" compare that to over 1,000 suicides and about 1,500 deaths from binge drinking and drug overdoses			0
" so while they are sad when they occur , school shootings are " very few and far between , and very unpredictable , " @entity23 said			1
this suggests that authorities can do greater good by focusing on the prevention of suicide and substance abuse than trying to guard against a campus killer			1
looking at a more general picture , while mass murders are more common now than in the 1960s , so is murder generally , @entity23 said			1
and although there is no pattern in terms of the way the killings occur , some trends can be drawn about those committing them , @entity23 said			2
his research indicates that from 1976 to 2008 , there were 852 massacres , involving 4,131 victims and 1,176 perpetrators			0
the perpetrators tend to be older than those committing murders generally , @entity23 said , with more than a quarter of those responsible for mass killings aged over 40 , his research shows , and the average age of those involved in campus shootings being 36			1
meanwhile , 60 % of those committing mass murders are white , compared with 47 % for murder generally , @entity23 said , and 94 % of the perpetrators are male , compared with 88 % for murder generally			1
@entity116 suggests that any sense that mass killings are on an upward spiral has more to do with the vagaries of human memory than actual facts			1
" since we tend to remember the ones that happened more recently , rather than the ones before , we often get the sense that three things make an epidemic , " he said			0
" they are rare events , and everything that is rare is difficult to predict			0
" @entity128 , senior faculty for ethics at the @entity130 , said that although changes in news media mean mass killings probably get more coverage now than in decades past , she does n't believe public perception of their frequency has been skewed as a result			1
that is because of the changing way the audience consumes information , said @entity128 , who also works on @entity144 's @entity143 , which looks at how the public handles information			0
" even though there 's more news out there about mass shootings , people are consuming less of it because there 's more news out there about everything , " @entity128 said			2
" i suspect that if you look at the average consumer 's diet when there is a mass shooting , it 's probably not much different than it was in the old system when there were fewer news organizations covering a mass event			0
" one reason for the increased coverage of massacres is that the breaking news environment has become so competitive , pushing many outlets to seek the most sensational lines , she said			0
national and international news providers also muscle in on stories that might previously have been left to local media , she said , and tend to dip into the most dramatic lines			0
concern is often raised that such wall - to - wall coverage , especially on cable news channels , may prompt copycat attacks			0
however , according to @entity128 , no solid scientific research has demonstrated a contagion effect resulting from media coverage of mass murders			1
the result must be that authorities struggle to second - guess the unpredictable acts of lone killers , with factors at play ranging from an individual 's sense of alienation or personal grievance to mental health care issues or the availability of weapons			0
but while every senseless massacre leaves a community in shock and tragically cuts short too many lives , the vast majority of @entity22 will remain untouched apart from the screaming headlines .			0

there is no upward trend in mass killings since the 1970s , professor @entity23 says
the perpetrators are older and more likely to be white than for murder generally , he says
suicides and substance abuse claim far more lives than campus shootings , he says
media coverage of mass killings has gone up , but people may not be watching , an *analyst* says
