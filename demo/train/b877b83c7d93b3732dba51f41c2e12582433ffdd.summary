@entity33 , considered one of the least safe places for cyclists based on fatalities , was at the bottom of the list			2
the league 's top recommendation was to adopt a statewide bicycle plan and to establish an advisory committee to oversee its implementation			0
@entity0 is considered a model for all other states on using federal funds for bicycle and pedestrian projects			2

it also creates a minimum 3 - foot " safe passing " distance for cyclists by motorists			2
related : drivers and cyclists square off on sharing the road to work the state also has a " complete streets " policy , which means new roads must be designed with cyclists and pedestrians in mind , @entity30 said			2
" every state says bicycles are treated the same as vehicles , but that needs to be clarified , " he said			0
