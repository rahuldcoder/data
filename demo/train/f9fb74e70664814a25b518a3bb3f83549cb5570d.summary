-- as rockets and missiles fly across the @entity6 - @entity5 border , @entity0 's @entity1 describes the mood on the ground in @entity5			1
is there a mood for war in @entity5 ? no. among people with no affiliation with one faction or another , there is little enthusiasm for this flare - up			1
they see no benefit whatsoever of firing missiles into @entity6 that result in airstrikes that are extremely disruptive to daily life			2
keep in mind that last summer after the overthrow of the @entity28 government in @entity29 , many of the tunnels under that country 's border with @entity5 were destroyed , so the economy is in abysmal shape			2
most gazans would like to see an immediate return to peace			0
they 're frustrated that since 2006 when @entity39 won elections and took over , @entity5 has been under siege			1
it 's very difficult to leave here ... it 's very difficult to earn a living , therefore few people are supporting this flare - up			1
why is this happening now ? are people supportive of @entity39 ? @entity39 is defiant , saying the blood of the martyrs will be fuel for the @entity51			2
on monday night it claimed responsibility for 60 missiles fired into @entity6			2
they 're on a war footing			0
@entity39 is blaming @entity6 for the current flare - up but it 's not putting out any olive branches			1
they 're going to contribute firing missiles into @entity6 until there 's some sort of cease - fire			1
in november 2012 the @entity29 were able to intercede between @entity6 and @entity39 and that led to a ceasefire , but now you have a very different government in @entity67 that is hostile to @entity39 and seems uninterested in intervening and bringing calm to @entity5			1
what is the attitude towards @entity6 ? the majority of people in @entity5 are the descendants of those who were driven or fled from their homes in 1948 - 49 , some from the very same areas currently being hit by rockets from @entity5			1
there is a deep sense of loss , of dispossession which is particularly intense in times of conflict			0
one man told me today " i hope they bomb the @entity88 , " referring to the militants firing rockets			0
another outside a house in @entity91 that had just been struck by a missile that left seven dead told me " the @entity6 have been killing us since i can remember			2
and they will continue to kill us after i die			0
" are there dissenting voices critical of @entity39 in @entity5 ? yes there are			1
many people you speak to are opposed to it because all the rocket firing does is make the situation worse			0
one man i spoke to said : " of course we dislike @entity39 and want them to go , but if i were to say that in public there would be trouble for me			2
" obviously there are few dissenting voices in public ; privately there are many			0
the only real opposition to @entity39 is @entity112 , but that faction that is dominant only in the @entity114 , not in @entity5			1
has the crisis reached a tipping point ? why has this flare - up happened now ? is it about more than just the tit - for - tat killings of the @entity6 and @entity121 teenagers ? in the aftermath of the @entity6 teenagers kidnapping on june 12 , @entity6 officials made it clear they were operating in the @entity114 and elsewhere on a two - track approach			1
on the one hand they wanted to find the boys and catch the kidnappers ; on the other they were cracking down on @entity39			2
that 's certainly set the tone			0
but you have go back to april 1 when @entity121 prime minister @entity133 announced there would be a unity or reconciliation pact between @entity112 and @entity39			1
the pact had much to do with @entity6 's decision to stop negotiating with the @entity121 in @entity142 secretary of state @entity141 's @entity140 peace initiative			1
and so the rhetoric coming out of @entity6 against @entity39 and the unity pact has been intensifying since april 1 , and redoubling since the june 12 kidnapping of the @entity6 teenagers			1
is the situation affected by the unrest in @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity29 ? this is not a recent conflict : it goes back 100 years to the arrival of the first @entity155 settlers in @entity156 and this is just the latest chapter in a very long book			0
it 's affected of course by the situation elsewhere in the region , but it 's very much its own problem			0
some @entity6 government and military officials in government are worried that the unrest elsewhere could impact the situation in the @entity114 in particular			2
they understand the @entity114 is unstable : you 've seen clashes in @entity5 , clashes in @entity121 - @entity6 cities in northern @entity6			1
they are aware that instability outside @entity6 could be mirrored by instability within @entity6 and the territories it controls			2
how are conditions in @entity5 compared to previous visits you 've made there ? it 's grim			2
most stores are closed , and that may be a function of @entity184 , or it may be a function of the grim state of the economy since the upheaval in @entity29 last year			0
there 's a weariness about the constant abnormal situation : keep in mind that the second @entity121 intifada began in september 2000 and @entity5 saw the most intense clashes and fighting between @entity6 forces and @entity121			1
that was followed by the @entity39 takeover in june 2007			2
then at the end of 2008 into 2009 there was the @entity6 - @entity39 war			1
then in november 2012 there was another flare - up between @entity39 and @entity6			1
so the economic situation being what it is , people are absolutely exhausted by the constant hammering of problems , crises , wars , clashes , upheavals			0
the situation is getting worse			0
there 's no sign that @entity6 's siege of @entity5 , as they call it , is easing			1
@entity6 continues to maintain a strict control of what enters and leaves @entity5 in terms of products , medicines and people			1
@entity29 also has a tight grip on that border , and often the border is closed for weeks on end			0
air and missile strikes are getting worse			0
many people are dependent on the @entity234 , which provides a lot of relief supplies , in one way or another			0
if you 're lucky you can get a job with the @entity39 - led government , with the police or the bureaucracy			2
there are people engaged in farming and light industry			0
but jobs are few are far between			0
what 's likely to happen next ? we 've heard from the @entity6 defense ministry that the operation is likely to last for several days at least , so i think we can expect more of the same			2
this morning an @entity6 defense spokesman said they believed @entity39 has an arsenal of about 10,000 rockets			1
at some stage they 'll run out , but so far the defense ministry believes they 've only fired about a tenth of that arsenal , so the firing is probably going to continue			0
@entity6 says it has two objectives in this mission , which they call " @entity267			0
" one is to stop the rocket fire on @entity6 , and the second is to strike at @entity39			1
but @entity39 is not just a military organization : it is a political organization ; it is the government in @entity5			1
it runs schools , hospitals and clinics , so what does it mean to strike at @entity39			0
in the past @entity6 has talked about destroying @entity39 , which no one in @entity5 thinks is a reasonable or realistic goal			1
so this could go on for days or weeks			0
in 2009 the war went on for just over three weeks			0
i do n't think this will go on that long , but it could last a while			0
what is the international community doing to calm tensions ? it 's not altogether clear			1
in the past @entity29 had some sway with @entity39 , but this is n't necessarily still the case			0
the @entity29 prime minister @entity287 is extremely hostile to @entity39 , which is the @entity121 off - shoot of the @entity289 , which he has mercilessly cracked down on			1
so he wo n't be shedding any tears seeing @entity39 taking a beating in @entity5			1
the @entity142 considers @entity39 to be a terrorist organization , and to the best of my knowledge , does not talk to it			0
and therefore there seems to be no intermediary involved trying to defuse this situation			0
the @entity301 government of prime minister @entity302 has good relations with @entity39 , and decent relations with the @entity142 , and that 's one of the powers that could become involved			1
but as of yet there 's no sign of this happening			0
so there 's no sign of urgency in the international community to become involved			1
there are of course many other fires burning in the region : @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity316			0
@entity5 and @entity6 is an old conflict that has frustrated many potential peacemakers in the past , and scares off many others who may contemplate it in the future			2
in @entity322 all we 're hearing are the usual calls for restraint			0
they do n't seem , in public at least , to put much pressure on @entity6 -- they 're always hesitant to do that -- and they have very little means to pressure @entity39 .			2

@entity0 's @entity1 says there 's little enthusiasm in @entity5 for the flare - up with @entity6
he says @entity39 is defiant but in private many @entity121 are opposed to their *leadership*
@entity6 's @entity342 rhetoric intensified after @entity39 reached a pact with @entity112 , he says
there 's been no sign of urgency in the international community to become involved , he says
