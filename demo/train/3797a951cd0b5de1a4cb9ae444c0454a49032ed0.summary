-- " at one point we killed eight people in 15 minutes			1
they did n't even have rocks ! that 's when i decided to defect			1
i threw away my gun and ran towards the protesters			2
" " about 1,500 protesters came ...			2
. they requested the release of an injured protester who was inside the hospital			0
there were 35 army soldiers and about 50 mukhabarat personnel at the checkpoint			2
we also had a jeep with a mounted machine - gun			0

the testimony is frequently harrowing			0

" people were approaching from different sides , and one guy came up to me and screamed , " ' if you are a man , shoot me ! ' the same moment , a mukhabarat guy next to me shot him in the shoulder , at close range , and tried to arrest him			1
his mother approached us and said , ' let him go ; take me instead ! , ' and a mukhabarat guy in civilian clothes in front of me shot the guy point blank and killed him , in front of his mother			0
" the mukhabarat are members of the the feared military intelligence service regarded as regime loyalists			0

" violations described in this report are those that several defectors described separately , " @entity37 says			1
most of the interviewees were conscripts but several were officers			0
one soldier said in the early days of the protests , commanders would brief their men " about how good @entity129 and his family were , and about the threats from the terrorists			2
and then they also forbade us from taking leave			0
" many of the soldiers said they were convinced that the government 's claims were false when they went on leave and realized that " close relatives and friends were participating in the protests and had been attacked by the security forces			1
" the @entity31 government continues to maintain that " armed gangs " and terrorists , incited from outside @entity31 , have been attacking the security forces			1
in an interview with the @entity149 network @entity150 a week ago , president @entity129 said he was not responsible for any misconduct by the security forces			0
" i do n't own them			0
i do n't own the country , so they 're not my forces , " he said			0
but some of the soldiers interviewed by @entity37 accuse senior officers close to the president of ordering them to shoot protestors			1
one man who says he served in the @entity163 said a brigadier general had instructed them to shoot at protestors in @entity64			0
he says he later found out that " the orders came from @entity167 , de facto commander of the @entity163 and president @entity167 's younger brother			2
" another soldier with the @entity163 said that his unit was deployed to make arrests in a @entity64 neighborhood in may			1

" when i came , he was still alive , " the former officer related			0
' he was screaming , and the soldiers were swearing and laughing			2
it lasted for about five minutes longer , and then he died			0
" the report also details ruthless treatment of soldiers who tried to avoid killing protesters			1
one soldier said that during a protest in @entity64 in april , a young conscript called @entity201 was shooting in the air and not at protestors			2
a military intelligence officer " called a sniper on the roof , pointed at @entity201 , and the sniper then shot @entity201 twice in the head			0
intelligence agents took @entity201 's body away			2

in @entity231 , we looted everything , both my unit and others			0
" @entity37 says defections from the @entity31 armed forces and intelligence agencies appear to have steadily increased since the protests began in march			1
@entity37 says the @entity240 should ensure the accountability of the officers named " up to the very highest levels of the @entity31 government " by referring @entity31 to the @entity243			1
" try as he may to distance himself from responsibility for his government 's relentless brutality , president @entity129 's claim that he did not actually order the crackdown does not absolve him of criminal responsibility , " says @entity246 , one of the report 's authors			0
" the ongoing killings , arrests , repression , and general denials of responsibility by the @entity31 government also make clear that officials have failed to take any meaningful action to address these abuses , " @entity37 concludes			1
the @entity263 estimates that some 5,000 people have been killed in @entity31 's unrest			1
on wednesday , @entity267 secretary - general @entity266 said : " this can not go on			1
in the name of humanity , it is time for the international community to act			1
" the report comes out a day after there were unconfirmed reports that 33 people were killed in @entity31			1
the deaths were reported by the @entity278 , an opposition group that organizes and documents protests			0
