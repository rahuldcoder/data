the sights of @entity1 are among the most familiar on the planet , but now tourists have a " new " way to see them -- by helium - filled airship			1
@entity7 's zeppelin -- 75 meters long , five stories high and as wide as a four - lane motorway -- made its inaugural commercial flight over a region of villages and woodland northwest of @entity1 on sunday			1
on clear days , the company says , the @entity14 would be visible in the distance			0
the @entity17 and @entity18 are other sights to be seen on the airship 's itineraries			0
the @entity23 - made craft , the first commercial dirigible to fly over the @entity1 region in 30 years , according to @entity7 , may have similar dimensions to an @entity28 superjumbo jet , but it 's a little slower at maximum speed : 90 kilometers an hour , at a 900 - meter altitude			1
tickets on the dirigible will be somewhat more expensive than other @entity1 tours , such as a seat on an open - top tour bus : prices start at just more than â‚¬ 200 ( $ 265 ) for a half - hour flight			1
non-flammable fuel the shadow of the @entity40 disaster still hangs over airships , even though the hydrogen - fueled craft -- caught forever on spectacular newsreel footage -- exploded over a @entity46 airfield more than 75 years ago , in 1937			2
@entity7 is quick to emphasize the safety of its new zeppelin			0
" this is probably the most safe aircraft [ flying ] because the gas inside is helium [ which is ] completely non-flammable , " airship pilot @entity49 , who is half - @entity50 and half - @entity51 , told the @entity52			2
" if the engines fail , unlike an aircraft , which has to come down , [ the airship ] can float ... until we find a safe place to land			2
" @entity7 hoped its zeppelin would become a familiar sight in the skies above @entity64 , not only for carrying downward - peering tourists , but for transporting cargo or for scientific missions			0
however , one barrier to realizing those plans is simply the lack of existing infrastructure on the ground to cope with such a large aircraft .			0

airship takes to skies around @entity1 for first time in 30 years
*latest* zeppelin is size of jumbo jet -- but a lot lighter and slower
tickets a little more expensive than most @entity1 tours ... make that a lot
non-flammable gas makes craft " safest way to fly "
