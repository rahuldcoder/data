-- forget relying solely on touch to control your @entity3 device			2
on future @entity5 , you may be able to control your tablet from across the room using @entity9 gestures , such as a swirl or swipe of the hand			1
as suggested by a newly uncovered @entity3 patent , you would be able to manipulate and control graphical elements on your display , such as icons , media files , text and images			2
the gestures themselves could take many forms : geometric shapes ( e.g. , a half - circle or square ) , symbols ( like a check mark or question mark ) , the letters of the alphabet , and other sorts of predetermined patterns			1
one interesting application the patent highlights is video annotation and editing via a gesture - based toolbar			2
the toolbar would provide pre-set options for beginners , but would also allow more advanced users to customize their own gestures			0
a previously discovered patent indicates that @entity3 could be working on an integrated projector for @entity43 that would incorporate physical gestures as a method to manipulate a projected image			1
this newer patent , however , focuses more on the gestures themselves and other ways they could be used to control onscreen images and video			0
there 's no mention of @entity56 or combining voice control with physical gestures			0
the @entity9 gesture - capturing method would employ a device 's front - facing camera			1
the @entity5 2 , @entity62 and @entity63 all include a front - facing camera , so if @entity3 , say , decided to integrate this feature in an upcoming version of @entity68 , it 's possible that legacy @entity70 models could employ the technology as well			1
that said , the patent does suggest that older iphones may not have enough processing power for the gesture - capturing workload , as it shows a way to transfer video from the @entity62 to an @entity5 for more advanced editing options			1
the patent pre-defines a number of gestures , such as ones for facial recognition , a selection gesture and a pointing gesture ( to identify a specific section of an onscreen image )			0
the patent was originally filed in mid- 2010			0
