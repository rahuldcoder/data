news reports indicate that @entity1 may be preparing for a nuclear test , potentially scheduled to coincide with president @entity4 's visit to @entity5 this week			1
the @entity1 foreign minister warned tuesday that @entity4 's trip could " escalate confrontation and bring the dark clouds of a nuclear arms race , " prompting speculation that the impulsive young leader of the @entity1 , @entity9 , is again crying out for attention			1
typically , experts and government officials refer to these outbursts and nuclear or missile tests as " provocations , " which are followed by sanctions , tensions and -- it is hoped -- a return to diplomacy			0
but by now , it should be obvious that while @entity1 behavior appears cyclical ( " there they go again " ) , @entity27 is on a clear , linear path to developing nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them on target in @entity34 and eventually the @entity35			1
@entity1 's third and most recent nuclear test , in february 2013 , used a relatively small 6 - to 9 - kiloton plutonium - based nuclear warhead , according to the @entity5 @entity39 , roughly half the yield of the nuclear bombs dropped on @entity42			1
if @entity1 's new test is substantially larger , it will demonstrate that @entity27 either has mastered the warhead design challenges of plutonium - based weapons or has covertly enriched uranium			2
if it is the former case , @entity1 will more easily be able to miniaturize its nuclear warhead technology for mating with ballistic missiles			0
if the latter case , @entity1 will probably demonstrate the ability to covertly stockpile large amounts of fissile material , since highly enriched uranium facilities can be more easily hidden underground and @entity1 has plenty of uranium mines to obtain the necessary fuel			0
either way , a " new form " of @entity1 nuclear test would signal a substantial increase in the country 's nuclear capabilities and not just another provocation requiring a short - term punishment from the international community			1
the @entity35 and its allies and partners would no doubt seek to place additional sanctions on @entity1 through the @entity71 , if such a test were to occur			1
however , given current tensions with @entity75 , as well as @entity77 concern about @entity1 stability , it is unlikely that the @entity79 would approve substantial new sanctions			0
yet , deterring @entity1 is critical			0
what more could be done ? first , if the @entity35 can not win substantial new sanctions at the @entity71 , it should take additional steps in concert with @entity5 , @entity34 and other allies and partners to squeeze the @entity88 's ability to import or export dangerous materials related to their missile and nuclear programs			1
additional sanctions should target @entity1 use of international banks to conduct illicit activities			0
although some of these institutions have been targeted ( most notably @entity98 in 2005 ) , more can be done to cut @entity1 off from its international financing			0
a coalition of like - minded states could also agree to inspect any and all ships or planes that have departed from @entity1 in the previous six months			0
this same coalition would work together to pressure @entity106 to increase inspections and cut off illicit banking activities with @entity1			0
moving @entity77 to action has usually been a challenge , but additional @entity1 provocations and @entity9 's execution of his uncle and @entity77 's contact in @entity27 , @entity115 , could motivate @entity77 to take steps , particularly once it is clear that the @entity35 is no longer willing to rely on the @entity79 for another round of weak sanctions			2
second , the @entity35 should respond to any @entity1 test by increasing cooperation trilaterally with @entity34 and @entity5			1
although @entity34 relations have been at a low point , the @entity35 has spearheaded efforts to make progress in the bilateral relationship in recent months			2
@entity4 's visit to both countries will surely touch on this issue , but a @entity1 provocation could help him drive @entity34 and @entity5 toward closer cooperation , particularly on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; missile defense ; and logistics			1
this would not only improve @entity35 - @entity34 - @entity5 cooperation but could also deter additional provocative actions and put pressure on @entity77 leaders to restrain their @entity1 ally			1
in december 2010 , the @entity35 , @entity34 and @entity5 came very close to issuing a joint collective security statement , declaring that an attack by the @entity1 on any of us would be an attack on all of us , after the @entity1 sank a @entity5 vessel and shelled civilians on a @entity5 - held island			1
that high bar could become achievable again			0
third , the @entity35 should bolster its extended deterrent framework -- or nuclear umbrella -- in @entity153			0
today , some question @entity35 willpower in the face of threats in the @entity158 , particularly after the uncertain @entity35 responses to aggression in @entity161 and @entity162			0
a @entity1 nuclear test would require the @entity35 to make unambiguous statements about the defense of our allies and follow through with demonstrations of @entity35 capability , including deployments of assets like the b - 2 bomber to @entity173 and increased exercises with @entity34 and @entity5			1
@entity1 is estimated to have enough fissile material now for between six and 12 nuclear weapons and is working hard on miniaturization and longer - range ballistic missiles capable of hitting not only @entity34 but someday , potentially , the @entity35			2
at this rate , it will not be long before an @entity35 president is going to ask his staff who let @entity1 develop the ability to threaten the @entity35 with impunity and why more was n't done to stop the @entity1			2
we know that diplomacy has failed to knock the @entity1 off its goal and that a military strike would risk dangerous retaliation against @entity34 and @entity5			2
but in between war and diplomacy , we have a range of options that could constrict the @entity1 's program and buy us time until the threat can be removed peacefully through diplomacy or collapse of the onerous regime in @entity27 .			0

@entity1 may *launch* nuclear test to coincide with @entity4 's visit to @entity5
**writers** : if it 's a more serious provocation , it could signal an *uptick* in nuclear capability
they say strong @entity71 sanctions necessary to stop a possible march toward nukes
**writers** : @entity35 must *strengthen* ties with @entity5 and @entity34 and build up its deterrent *system*
