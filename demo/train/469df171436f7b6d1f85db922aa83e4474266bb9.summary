-- high - tech sensors are everywhere			0
they alert us to spoiled food			0
they monitor our stress levels			1
and they 're blowing up in the health and fitness space , too , helping us track our key sleep and activity metrics			1
and now we have the @entity12 , a desktop display that keeps an eye on one 's posture			0
the 24 - inch lcd monitor uses a built - in cmos sensor to determine your distance from the screen and your neck angle while sitting			1
the monitor works with software made by @entity25 , and , like a worried mother , will remind you to straighten your back , keep your distance from the display , and take breaks from sitting at the computer			1
according to @entity33 , the sensor measures your inter-pupillary distance -- the distance two pupils -- to determine whether you 're sitting at an optimal distance from the monitor			1
the system can also sense if your neck is inclined at a poor ergonomic angle , and will give you corrective feedback showing you the ideal angle position			0
and if you 've been sitting for too long , the built - in software will remind you to get up to take a break			1
we have n't seen a @entity12 monitor in action yet , but if it does what it says , it could be valuable for consumers wanting a more ergonomic workstation			1
" it 's an interesting concept and it certainly provides a potential value for timing and alerting people to take a break , " @entity51 , director of the @entity52 at @entity53 and professor of medicine at @entity55 , told @entity0			0
" it may have value in terms of posture depending on how it measures neck angle and distance from the screen			1
" the design of the monitor itself is also ergonomically friendly			2
@entity33 dubs the base " @entity73 " as it can be lowered to almost desk level , and allows users to tilt , rotate , swivel , and make angle adjustments to the screen			0
this is an important feature to include in the monitor , @entity51 says : " we know that if a monitor is set too high or too low , and a person has to work with their head in extension , it can lead to neck pain			2
" @entity51 advises people to set their monitors so that it is at a 10 - to 20 - degree angle below the horizon of their eyes			0
the eco-concsious can rest easy with this monitor , too			2
when you walk away from the screen , it will automatically detect that you 're no longer present and power itself down			2
the device is also made out of 65 % recycled plastics , and comes with a 0 - watt hard switch that lets you cut power completely off from the monitor for zero power consumption			1
the monitor is available in the @entity108 for 285 euros ( about $ 375 )			0
the company has not yet released a launch date or price for the @entity112			0
