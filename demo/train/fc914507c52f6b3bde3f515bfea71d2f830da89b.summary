-- @entity1 has n't yet been found liable of killing a man while drinking and driving , but there 's not much question about whether he 's guilty			1
it 's not because of the the homicide charges that were filed against him on monday			0
but it 's because @entity1 went on @entity9 last week and told the world he 'd done just that			1
@entity1 's confession , a highly produced , three - and - a - half minute video that has been viewed by more than 1.2 million people , is the sort of pronouncement that would have been impossible before the world had social media platforms at its fingertips			1
and it 's raising questions that go far beyond the 22 - year - old @entity23 man 's guilt or innocence			2
chief among them : was @entity1 , who says he plans to plead guilty and accept whatever punishment is handed down , just trying to get a lighter sentence by using the @entity29 to get out in front of a criminal case in which he had n't even yet been charged ? on @entity34 , a blog by students , faculty and alumni of the @entity41 's master 's program in digital media , graduate @entity33 argues that parts of the video seem orchestrated to do just that			1
" that he sees the video as a tactical move in a legal chess game is evident , " @entity33 writes , noting the way @entity1 cites depression as a reason for his drinking			1
and if it buys @entity1 some sympathy from the court ? well , it 's not farfetched to imagine others trying a similar tactic , he writes			1
" we may well be in for a flurry of copycat videos as miscreants of all sorts try to duplicate what works in this one , " wrote @entity33			0
" one can imagine the appearance of less and less competent videos , resulting eventually in a criminal confession so ineptly scripted and produced that it becomes an ironically viral phenomenon in the manner of @entity73 's ' friday '			1
" @entity1 's attorney , @entity74 , dismisses such speculation			1
" despite any speculation of his intentions , the video was meant to raise awareness related to the serious issues surrounding drinking and driving , " he said in a statement sent to @entity0			1
but what does it mean for criminal justice -- a system that is designed to move deliberately -- that a new generation of young people can potentially influence the system by sharing something instantly with the entire world ? @entity94 is the founder of " because i said i would , " the website where @entity1 's video began spreading			1
he 's also the person who produced it , enhancing the raw footage with a swelling orchestral soundtrack and visual effects that make it look like a public service announcement			0
he told @entity0 that @entity1 was familiar with his site , on which people make public pledges to help them follow through with good deeds , and reached out to him with his story			1
@entity94 said he did n't consider contacting police because he knew @entity1 was already a suspect and that prosecutors were preparing charges			1
a grand jury in @entity112 , @entity23 , indicted @entity1 on monday on charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol			2
he is charged in the death of @entity119 , 61 , who was killed june 22 when a wrong - way driver hit his jeep on @entity122 near @entity123 , @entity23			2
" the whole goal of this video is to convince people to not drink and drive -- to come to that realization that a lot of people make the same excuses that @entity131 makes in his life about drinking and driving , " @entity94 said			2
" to make that message compelling , we made this video			2
" @entity94 calls @entity1 's confession and plea for others to avoid drunken driving , " honorable			1
" but he 's pushed back against those on his site who have heaped praise upon the young man			0
" while @entity131 certainly made an honorable decision to confess , because i said i would does not believe that @entity131 should be praised as a ' hero , ' " @entity94 wrote on the site			0
" @entity131 made an irresponsible choice to drink and drive that ended an innocent man 's life			0
" @entity131 decided to release this video because he wants to raise awareness about the dangerous and irreversible consequences of drinking and driving			2
if that message is not heard ... if viewers do not make the commitment to never drink and drive , then the video has certainly failed in its mission			2
" he 's got at least one perhaps unlikely believer			0
" he ruined two lives , " said @entity164 , the victim 's ex-wife			0
" he took @entity119 's life , and he ruined his life			0
" " it 's gut - wrenching , coming from a mother , looking at that young boy , " she said , saying she admired him for confessing so publicly			0
" you 've got to respect him for that			0
" it 's impossible to know the full measure of @entity1 's motives			2
was it self - interest ? sincere remorse ? perhaps some of both ? @entity33 , now interactive director for a @entity182 tv station , can envision it as part of a new , look - at - me world in which internet celebrity is celebrated , regardless of the reason for it			0
" today , the only thing standing between any one of us and instant celebrity is our ability to create a message with resonance , " he wrote			0
" @entity1 may view the death he caused as a personal opportunity , the mother of all @entity199 timeline life events			1
he may lose a few years to prison , but he won the @entity201 and when he gets out , he 'll have a chance to parlay this 15 minute shot of fame into a repeat			0
only time will tell if his redemption story gets him onto ' @entity207			0
