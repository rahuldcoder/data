-- what does it mean to be @entity3 ? that 's the question on the lips of many in @entity8 's most populous country as new national identity cards are being rolled out			1
but this is an i.d. with a difference			0
the card , which fits into a wallet and comes with a credit - card style chip , can also be used to make electronic payments			1
@entity3 can use it to deposit funds , receive social benefits , pay for goods and withdraw cash at @entity21 across the country , according to @entity23 , which provides the card 's prepaid payment technology			1
the company also claims that by providing proof of identity , the card solves one of the biggest problems people face when trying to open a bank account			1
" to all @entity3 , i say , remember the @entity38 , is your identity , " @entity3 president @entity33 said at the launch of the @entity35 , or @entity36 , at the end of august			1
" the card is not only a means of certifying your identity , but also a personal database repository and payment card , all in your pocket			2
" the card could also be used for voting in the future , while @entity45 , director general and ceo of the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , said that citizens will have " the potential to use it as an international travel document			0
" earlier this week , finance minister @entity51 said 3,000 people had received cards			0
in order to get the document , @entity3 have to register at one of the @entity47 enrollment centers around the country and provide 10 fingerprints , a picture of their face and iris , as well as information about their age and place of birth			1
once registered , the @entity47 official issues an @entity69 number and then the card			0
growth opportunity @entity3 produces more oil than any other @entity74 nation , but the @entity75 says only about 30 % of the population have a bank account			1
given 170 million people live in the country , @entity23 claims to have spotted an opportunity for growth			0
research conducted by @entity23 's consultancy arm says that cash dependency in a country like @entity3 can cost up to 1.5 % of @entity86			1
given @entity3 has recently recently re-calculated it 's 2013 gdp to a figure of $ 488 billion , making it @entity8 's biggest economy , that 's certainly an amount the government is keen to keep a hold of			2
card controversy but not everyone is happy with this pocket - sized one - stop - shop			0
@entity96 attacked the scheme on @entity98 : while @entity99 , lead director at the non-governmental organisation @entity100 , said the collaboration was not appropriate			0
" there should be difference between everyday credit or payment cards and an identity card issued by a sovereign authority , " he says			1
" even if @entity23 was needed to ensure a good payment system , there is nothing that says it must be heavily embossed on the card			2
it could guarantee the card without necessarily getting this free advert from 170 million @entity3			2
" @entity99 has also criticised the way the @entity3 government partnered with the international payments provider			2
" the choice of @entity23 did not undergo a competitive selection process , " he claims			0
" it was clearly an abuse of @entity3 's public procurement process and the selection should have been open to all companies that can provide the service			1
a @entity23 spokesperson denied the payments company was turning the i.d. card project into a branding exercise			1
in an emailed statement the company said " the brand mark is not @entity23 's corporate logo , nor is it an advertisement for the company			1
the @entity23 brand displayed on the card is what makes the electronic payment component of the eid card accepted as a means of payment			1
" @entity47 spokesperson @entity142 rejected any allegation of foul play in partnering with @entity23			0
" it 's a level playing field , " he said in a phone interview			0
" other payment providers have been invited to get involved , but were apprehensive			0
" and @entity148 , president of @entity23 's @entity8 division , joined @entity142 in dismissing this claim			2
in a phone interview he said that " the collaboration went through all the highest levels of government			0
" previous attempts this is not the first time @entity3 authorities have tried to implement such a card			1
the idea of a national identity card scheme for @entity3 was first initiated in 1978 , according to the @entity163 @entity162			1
but successive governments and coups meant the idea did not become a reality			0
more recently , progress on the provision of identity cards for @entity3 took shape in early 2003 , when some 60,000 centers were set up to register citizens			2
while the approach to take photographs and fingerprints sought to avoid fraud , an article on the @entity163 refugee agency 's website reports that irregularities in the roll - out of the i.d. cards meant that by 2008 the government was planning a new card			0
a month into this latest identity project there remains no fixed timetable for when the roll out of the initial 13 million cards will be completed			0
