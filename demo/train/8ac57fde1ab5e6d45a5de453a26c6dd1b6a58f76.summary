-- the people in @entity2 do not want the world to forget what happened there 18 years ago			1
this week , @entity2 mark the 18th anniversary of the april 6 , 1994 , genocide that took place in their country			1
for many , this is a somber but very necessary exercise , and many will visit sites where their families and friends were killed			2
but on a recent visit there , i took away that although people want to remember what happened , they also want to show the world how they have moved on			2
it was 14 years ago when i last visited @entity2			1
i was covering president @entity24 as a @entity26 correspondent when @entity27 touched down march 26 , 1998			2
i remember thinking how absolutely beautiful and lush the countryside was flying in			2
it was hard to believe this was the same place where such atrocities occurred			2
we stayed on the tarmac for three hours because the @entity34 deemed it was too dangerous for the president to leave the airport			2
during our short stay in 1998 , @entity24 apologized on behalf of the @entity39 people to the @entity2 for not doing enough to stop the 1994 genocide			1
during that period , @entity2 's @entity42 majority targeted and slaughtered the @entity45 minority and @entity42 moderates , killing 800,000 people in 100 days			1
after his speech was over , i interviewed a genocide survivor			2
she was a young woman who had been gang raped and carried scars across her head from a huge machete			2
we sat across from each other in metal folding chairs in the airport hanger			0
i asked her the only thing that was on my mind : " what gives you the strength to go on ? " and she responded " faith			0
" fourteen years later to the day , i would be invited to participate in a service project that would bring me back to @entity2			1
last week , i traveled with a small group of female journalists			0
we were asked to help teach young @entity2 women how to tell their own stories through journalism			1
they call it " the girl effect " -- investing in young women early in their lives so that it will pay off later in curbing poverty , disease and despair			2
in @entity2 , the concept is " ni nyampinga			1
" in their local language , it means striving to be a beautiful woman inside and out			0
one of those women i met was 23 - year - old @entity89			0
she is a young actress who has been in a number of films and tv shows in @entity2			1
kids go crazy seeing her on the street because they recognize her from a series she did on children 's rights			0
as in the @entity39 , making a living as an actor is tough , so she does electronics repair and translations on the side			0
like many @entity2 , she speaks at least three languages -- @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
@entity106 is part of the new generation of @entity2 that has hope and the opportunities to pursue their dreams			1
when i first met her , she smiled easily and exuded a kind of calm that felt maternal			0
but @entity106 's path to this point has been difficult , and she was very open about her struggle			1
when @entity106 was 7 , her parents and six of her 10 siblings were killed in the genocide			1
her earliest memory is of running -- running with her sister , her mother and many others for reasons she says she did n't understand			0
@entity106 says she remembers first her father being shot , then her mother attacked			1
" they put a spear in her back			0
... then they shot my younger sister and cut the leg off one of my other sisters			0
then after that , that 's when they killed my mom , but she did not die			0
she was talking to my sister , asking for water , but she could not go out to search for water			0
then she died , " @entity106 says			1
@entity106 and her older sister , @entity144 , survived after the killers launched a grenade			1
" she was sleeping in front of me , and her blood was all over over me , and they thought we were both dead			0
that night she took me to walk , " @entity106 says			1
days later on the dangerous journey , @entity106 and @entity144 were apprehended by a group and thrown into a pit of dead bodies			1
" a certain day many killers came and the leaders took me and my sister and then they opened a big hole and threw us in			0
i was asking please forgive us			0
" @entity106 says she asked @entity144 whether they were actually dead			1
the two survived because a friend of @entity106 's sister paid someone to pull them out			1
" someone came and opened up and removed my sister and tried to remove me but because there were many dead they said , ' we leave her here			0
' " @entity106 's sister saved her life when she offered to take her place			1
but they could not save everyone			0
" the sad thing is that they closed the pit , and they left the other man inside , and he was still alive , " @entity106 says			1
this is just a small part of @entity106 's complicated story			2
when i asked her how she endured such tragedy and is able to cope today , she says , " i think it 's an obligation			0
i have to do something good for my country			0
... i ask myself why did i stay , why not my younger sister , why not my brother , and i say maybe @entity188 has something that he wants me to do			0
" @entity106 is doing plenty these days , including theater , teaching and voice - over work			2
she is most proud of her performances that draw attention to the problem of violence against girls and says it contributes to her healing			0
" there is no paradise on @entity202			0
what happened in @entity2 can happen anywhere , " @entity106 says			1
but @entity106 also is somewhat of an ambassador for her country			2
" @entity2 is not only about genocide			1
i think @entity2 is about something else , " she says			2
" i think many people when they hear @entity2 they link it with genocide , but after 18 years , @entity2 is at a certain point			1
... we have our culture , we have our history , we have many things			0
" we have a developing country			0
it 's a tourist country			0
... it is our history but we also want people to know that @entity2 is not all about genocide ; @entity2 is something else			1

on april 6 , 1994 , a genocide began in @entity2 that claimed 800,000 lives
one of the survivors is now a *popular* actress , @entity227
" what happened in @entity2 can happen anywhere , " says " @entity106 "
she says the @entity2 of 2012 is about so much more than its bloody past
