-- how do @entity2 wireless carriers expect their investments in new @entity5 high - speed networks to pay off ? this shift is about more than simply providing mobile data -- and it could even bring some long - overdue improvements to the humble telephone call			1
at the @entity11 conference last week in @entity12 , a panel of carrier executives and wireless industry experts discussed the revenue - generating opportunities of offering 4g service			1
this is a big concern for carriers , since their costly move to @entity23 a few years ago appears to have financially benefited other players in the mobile industry ( such as @entity26 ) more than the carriers themselves			2
there are some obvious ways that carriers plan to make money from their 4g networks			1
first , these networks will allow wireless carriers to sell more data -- a key part of their business model as most @entity2 carriers move away from offering unlimited data plans			1
also , current @entity42 net neutrality rules allow wireless carriers to selectively " fast track " delivery of online content and services			1
most likely content and service providers , rather than consumers , would end up paying for such paid prioritization			2
still , despite heavy marketing , @entity5 phones and services have n't been easy to sell to the average mobile consumer			2
as @entity59 , a consumer internet analyst with @entity61 , noted : " for most consumers , the value of @entity5 is not really clear at this point -- except for watching mobile video			0
" consequently @entity2 carriers are starting to look hard at less - obvious ways to demonstrate the value of @entity5 to consumers			1
" the phone call has n't been significantly improved or enhanced since the introduction of touch tone dialing , " observed @entity65 , a partner with the venture capital firm @entity66			0
" @entity5 is already allowing people to do great things with their phones -- but most people still spend about 47 % of their time on their cell phones making regular phone calls			0
" sprint cto @entity77 said , " it is important to not lose sight of what customers see as important			0
despite how much carriers are focusing on @entity5 data speed , most customers measure network success based on voice - call quality			1
" improving the audio quality and clarity of voice calls is one reason why some @entity2 carriers are working to implement " voice over @entity95 " ( @entity93 ) technology			1
earlier this year @entity96 announced plans to start selling @entity93 - enabled phones in early 2012			1
earlier , @entity96 director of ecosystem development @entity99 told @entity0 that " high - definition audio fidelity will be a major selling point " for @entity96 -- implying that the carrier might be hoping to sell @entity93 as some kind of premium service , at least initially			1
that 's another way to make extra money from a @entity5 network			0
the discount carrier @entity109 may be moving faster than @entity96 toward deploying @entity93 for its customers			1
already , @entity109 has begun migrating text and multimedia messaging traffic to its lte network			0
( traditionally , @entity116 / @entity115 messaging is handled over the same base carrier network as voice calls			0
) but @entity119 notes that @entity109 has less wireless spectrum access than @entity96			0
also , @entity109 never rolled out 3g technology as extensively as the major carriers			0
so , since @entity5 and @entity93 could help @entity109 squeeze more mileage from its existing spectrum , this could mean that @entity109 might offer these as basic -- not premium -- services			1
that would make for interesting competition in the consumer mobile market -- especially since @entity109 focuses on the no - contract mobile market			0
if @entity93 calling becomes commonplace , it could change how people pay for cell phone service			2
if most mobile voice calls happen over data networks , then carriers may stop selling " minutes " altogether and shift to charging solely for data packages			1
but initially , as carriers first start marketing " high definition calling , " they may face some consumer pushback due to perceived value			0
consumers who get @entity93 phones and service might not always experience clearer phone calls , since only calls placed between @entity93 - enabled phones are expected to sound better			1
calls between a @entity93 - enabled phone and a regular cell phone are expected to sound the same			2
as the recent backpedaling by major banks on proposed debit card fees indicates , right now corporations are wary of consumer revolts against mounting bills			0
right now wireless carriers generally bill customers for service for each mobile device they use ( with the exception of cell phone " family plans " )			2
but these days , consumers also use tablets , gaming consoles and other devices over carrier networks			2
if consumers revolt against the cumulative sticker shock of multiple monthly bills for connectivity , carriers may begin to move away from device - specific billing -- which includes tethering charges			2
there is one more way that wireless carriers can make money from @entity5 : selling data about consumers			1
@entity180 , cto for @entity96 , raised the point that @entity5 will allow users to do even more with their cell phones and other wireless devices -- which means carriers will be gathering more consumer data than ever before via their networks			1
" all that data , about all the facets of users ' lives -- that 's got value , " @entity180 said			0
" and that 's a revenue opportunity for us			0
" @entity195 agreed , but cautiously : " we know there 's a fine line between monetization and trust for our customers			0
we think consumer data would be more useful in the aggregate , for machine - to - machine interfaces , without bringing it down to a particular person			0
" the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity208 .			0

cellphone carriers are trying to earn more revenue from offering 4g networks
wireless networks can sell more data and sell data about consumers to generate revenue
carriers are improving audio quality and selling it through " voice over @entity95 " ( @entity93 )
