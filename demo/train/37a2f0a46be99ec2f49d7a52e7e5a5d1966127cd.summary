-- @entity1 quit the presidential race on wednesday			0
long after he exhausted the patience of the voters , he finally concluded that the mathematical probability of winning the @entity7 nomination was next to nil			2
why spend money and raise false hopes if you ca n't win ? best to get out now and join the veepstakes			0
that 's the kind of logic that an ordinary , candidate - focused campaign employs			1
@entity16 , on the other hand , refuses to drop out			1
commanding a plurality of delegates in only one state , and having taken just 10.61 percent nationally so far , it could be argued that the 76 - year - old libertarian has even less reason to carry on than @entity23 -- except perhaps to collect the air miles			2
however , unlike @entity23 , @entity16 's campaign represents a message that is bigger and perhaps more popular than the candidate himself			1
as it continues to collect small numbers of delegates and capture control of local @entity33 , @entity29 is proving itself to be in rude health			1
@entity35 after @entity36 is nominated , feted at the convention , beaten by @entity38 and recycled as a question on @entity40 ( " in 2012 , he lost every state but @entity48			0
" " who is ... @entity50 ? " ) , @entity16 's philosophy will still be a factor in national politics -- something to be feared and courted in equal measure			1
@entity51 has certainly made some big errors this year , such as exclusively focusing on @entity53 and @entity54			0
although he did well in both , only a first in either would have really justified the expense			0
thereafter , the campaign unwisely ignored @entity58 and @entity59 , reasoning that their expensive media markets were n't worth the effort			0
as a consequence , @entity16 was ignored for weeks until @entity64			1
i am informed by @entity16 sources that their campaign was counting on @entity1 and @entity69 to drop out after they realized they could n't win , which would have allowed @entity16 to emerge as the only conservative challenger to @entity36			1
of course , that 's not what happened			2
strategy aside , the candidate had his faults , too			2
i have to declare a great deal of affection for @entity16			1
unlike other politicians , he seems motivated by ideas -- and he communicates his passion with the zeal of a nutty professor detailing the thrilling possibilities of quasars and black holes			0
this is a doctor who refused to accept @entity89 payments but lowered his prices for patients who could n't afford him , who declined a government pension and never voted for a tax increase , who told @entity7 they need to end the @entity96 ( and most other wars , too )			0
but @entity16 has also been around a long time and is starting to look like a perennial candidate			1
his emphasis upon a noninterventionist foreign policy might be what attracted so many activists and donations , but it has also contributed to the sense that he is a marginal candidate			2
there simply are n't enough anti-war conservatives within the @entity7 to justify the energy that @entity16 generates around the issue , while the @entity33 brand is too toxic to attract enough crossover anti-war liberals into the primaries to turn him into a contender			1
@entity115 's remark that " i love @entity16 on everything but @entity117 , " is a good summary of his problem : while @entity16 's platform is attractive to many conservatives , he remains solely identified by his opposition to the war on terror			1
nevertheless , @entity16 's 2012 candidacy has had certain hidden successes			1
aside from all the money he raised , @entity16 also attracted an unusual coalition of young people , libertarian @entity7 , and disaffected @entity131 -- a coalition large enough for him to run even with @entity38 in some polls			1
the pull among the kids was big enough to fuel talk of a new generational voting bloc			0
in @entity53 , he took 48 % of the under - 30s , compared with @entity69 's 23 % and @entity36 's 14 %			2
in @entity54 , he got 47 % , while @entity36 took just 26 %			0
there was a problem , however			0
in @entity141 ( the only state that was a straightforward @entity16 vs @entity36 vote ) , @entity16 's vote was overwhelmingly young but not orthodox @entity7 in its views			1
his supporters were more inclined to be pro-choice on abortion , nonevangelical , and opposed to the tea party			0
given that @entity16 is pro-life , religious , and wildly supportive of the tea party , this confirms the growing tension between the man and his movement			1
in the future , a @entity154 candidate might do better by running third party on a more socially tolerant platform			2
young people seem to like their libertarianism to be socially tolerant as well as fiscally prudent			0
within the @entity33 , the @entity160 are still the unbeaten masters of the administrative procedure			1
last saturday , they swept a confusing ballot process in @entity163 to give themselves control of 70 % of delegates attending the state 's nominating convention , which could mean they end up numerically " winning " @entity163			2
similar things have happened in @entity170 and even @entity36 's home state of @entity172			0
combine this administrative brilliance with generational politics and you get a silent grass - roots revolution that is putting many paulites in positions of power			0
in 2010 , more than a dozen of them won elections as @entity7 , including rep. @entity183 of @entity184 and sen. @entity185 ( son of @entity16 ) of @entity187			1
this year , two dozen active @entity16 backers are seeking election to @entity190 , along with more than 200 running for local office			1
the paulites have effectively taken over the @entity33			1
the state central committee now has six members who are passionate for @entity16 , and the head of the local party is now a paulite			2
given the importance of @entity53 to the 2016 nomination , this is a coup in every sense			0
all of this means the @entity33 can no longer ignore its libertarian " fringe			1
" on the contrary , it will have to reach out to a new generation of activists who do n't regard religious piety or continual warfare as sacred tenets of conservatism			0
even @entity36 will have to take @entity212 's advice not to " marginalize " the @entity192 if he is to emerge from the nominating convention with a united party			0
whatever happens in 2012 , we are living through a significant moment in the history of conservatism			0
the age of @entity220 and @entity38 -- twin specters of lavish spending and imperial design -- have birthed anti-government movements of right ( tea party ) and left ( @entity226 )			0
the one that will last longest and have the most impact is the one that has been the most pragmatic and politically savvy			0
the @entity16 revolution wo n't stop here			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			2

@entity234 says @entity16 has gained *influence* , if not a nomination
@entity16 's brand of libertarian @entity240 *deserves* @entity33 notice , he says
@entity16 represents a message that is bigger than the candidate , @entity234 says
