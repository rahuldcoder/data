" but @entity83 , which has criticized the allied campaign , said it had " serious doubts " about @entity9 's assertion that it is not targeting @entity5 and his family			1
" the disproportional use of force , all the more so , beyond the mandate of @entity93 1973 , which in no way stipulates the replacement of the @entity1 leadership , is leading to harmful consequences and the death of civilians , " the @entity88 said in a statement carried by the official @entity91 news agency			1
" we are again calling for strict compliance with the provisions of the decisions made by the international community on the @entity1 conflict , for an immediate cease - fire and the start of a political settlement without any preconditions			2

images on @entity136 showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags			0
protesters could be heard yelling , " we want to redeem the martyr , " and , " oh youth , this is time for jihad			0
" they were joined at one point by @entity12 , who told the demonstrators , " every one of you are @entity22			0
" " we will make @entity1 the grave of all invaders , " he told the crowd			1
a spokesman for the @entity1 opposition doubted the report of the death			2
" in all honesty , we never heard of @entity22 until the start of the uprising , " said @entity156 , deputy chairman of the @entity157 in @entity40			0
" we do n't believe this is true , " @entity156 said			0
" it is all fabrications by the regime in a desperate attempt to get sympathy			0
... this regime constantly lies and keeps lying			0
" despite skepticism by some rebels , some opposition members celebrated the report of @entity22 's death in the streets of @entity40			2
revelers danced and sang overnight as the sound of celebratory gunfire pierced through the air			0
" by @entity178 , we 're not supposed to rejoice anyone 's death , " one man told @entity2			2
" but we want him to feel the pain and sorrow that we 're going through with our own people he killed			0
" many of the reported civilian deaths have come out of the western city of @entity188			0
on sunday , a witness there described especially intense shelling by government forces in the country 's third - largest city and speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports of the death of @entity5 's son			1
