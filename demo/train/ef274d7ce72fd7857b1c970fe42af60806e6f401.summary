@entity22 , " severely tortured and detained			2
" @entity24 , " shot dead by policemen			2
for many too young or too distant to remember , apartheid is little more than a distant historical fact , a system of forced segregation to learn about in history class , to condemn and to move on			1
but for @entity7 who survived the decades of punishing racial classification , humiliating work rules , forced relocation and arbitrary treatment by authorities , the end of apartheid was the birth of an entirely new world , midwifed in large part by @entity46			1
a history of apartheid though white @entity51 had long ruled in @entity7 , the formal system of apartheid came into existence after @entity53 the country 's @entity54 -- led by the descendants of @entity51 settlers known as @entity58 -- ushered it into existence after sweeping into power on a campaign calling for stricter racial controls amid the heavy inflow of blacks into @entity7 cities			1
between 1949 and 1953 , @entity7 lawmakers passed a series of increasingly oppressive laws , beginning with prohibitions on blacks and whites marrying in 1949 and culminating with laws dividing the population by race , reserving the best public facilities for whites and creating a separate , and inferior , education system for blacks			1
one of the laws , the @entity79 , forced blacks , @entity80 , @entity81 and people of mixed heritage to live in separate areas , sometimes dividing families			1
blacks had to live in often barren tribal homelands or townships near cities , often in polluted industrial areas			2
whites got the best agricultural areas , the choicest city addresses			2
a system of passes and identity papers controlled where blacks could travel and work			1
" ooo , do n't talk about the @entity79 , " the resident of one such area , @entity101 , said , according to the @entity102 in @entity103			2
" i will cry all over again			2
there 's when the trouble started ... when they chucked us out of @entity108			2
my whole life came changed			2
what they took away they can never give back to us			2
" apartheid rules governed virtually every aspect of daily life			1
blacks had to use different beaches and public restrooms			2
signs distinguished facilities reserved for whites -- often referred to as @entity51			2
blacks earned meager wages compared with whites , and their children went to poorly funded schools			0
in one of the telling anecdotes of the apartheid era , black nannies who dressed and fed and sang to the children of their white employers were unable to join them in the @entity131 , the main @entity58 congregation			1
@entity7 since apartheid : boom or bust ? growing defiance in the 1950s , growing calls for civil disobedience against the government took hold , sometimes resulting in violence as police cracked down on the protests			1
the 1952 @entity143 , for instance , prompted thousands of black @entity144 to flout the laws in hopes that their arrests would overwhelm the country 's prison system and bring attention and eventual change			1
thousands were arrested , but the @entity153 , which organized the campaign , had to call it off after scores were hurt by police			0
in 1960 , the tide began to turn when @entity7 police killed 69 protesters gathered outside the @entity161 police station for a nonviolent protest			0
the killings led not only to international outcry but calls for armed struggle by the @entity153 and other groups			1
a grim record that struggle continued for years			0
it 's laid out in gruesome detail in the records of @entity7 's @entity172 , formed after the end of apartheid to help expose and heal the country 's many wounds			1
@entity0 , the woman shot in the back as she went to church , told her story to the commission in 1996			0
she told an awful story , of a police officer with almost complete power in her neighborhood , a man who used to randomly fire off his gun -- and who she said had also killed her son			0
" he brought suffering to me by killing my son			0
he wanted to kill me			0
that is why he shot me , " she told the commission			0
@entity4 , who testified at the same hearing , told the commission he spent two months in prison after being taken from his home in 1986 and beaten at a police station			0
" they assaulted me with fists ; they kicked me , and i fell on the ground , " he said			0
" they did n't ask me anything ; they did n't tell me what do they -- what did they want			0
" @entity210 told his story to researchers from @entity213 in 2006			0
he recalled marching in @entity103 in 1977 after police closed many of the high schools attended by blacks in an apparent effort to break up resistance efforts			0
police trapped the marchers and set on them as they tried to escape			0
" they just hit everybody , " @entity210 told his interviewers			0
" there was blood , cries			0
i remember we were shouting , ' peace ! peace ! peace ! ' " he spent three weeks in the city 's @entity231 prison in a cell with 20 other young men			0
there , he remembers police threatening to take troublemakers to the 10th floor " workshop , " where police were suspected of staging fatal accidents involving inmates			0
" we knew what the workshop meant , " he told his interviewers			0
" finally free when @entity46 was freed in 1990 , four years before he would become president , another surprising element of apartheid reared its head			1
before his release , few had seen @entity46 's now - famous face or heard his voice			1

" @entity46 : 10 surprising facts you probably did n't know			1

apartheid was more than racial segregation
it was a *brutalizing* regime of laws that *ripped* families apart and led to violence
@entity46 is *revered* for his role in helping bring down the system
