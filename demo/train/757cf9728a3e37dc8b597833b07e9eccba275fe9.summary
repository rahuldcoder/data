-- when someone tells you to go jump in a lake , sometimes it 's best to take their advice			0
for one golfer , it saved him from a world of hurt			2
at first , @entity13 thought nothing was out of the ordinary when he swatted an insect away from his face at a tournament in @entity19 on friday			1
the next thing he knew , he was being attacked by a swarm of hornets			1
" they were three times the size of bees , " said the @entity23			1
" they were huge and 30 or 40 of them started to attack me big time			0
" i did n't know what to do			0
my caddy told me to run , so i start running like a crazy guy , but the hornets were still there , so the other players told me to jump in the lake			2
" i ran to the lake , threw my scorecard down , took off my shoes and jumped in the water			2
" it was the scariest moment of my career , for sure			0
i 've never been so scared			1
" thankfully , after some treatment , the 30 - year - old was able to continue			1
remarkably , he birdied the hole he was on when the attack occurred -- the 14th -- then completed his second round in four - under - par 68 , which meant he made the halfway cut of the @entity53 event			1
" the referees and a doctor took me aside and gave me a couple of injections and told me to relax , " @entity13 said on the @entity53 website			1
" after the injections i felt a lot better and could continue			0
without the help of the referees i could n't have finished the round , because i was in no state to play golf			2
" tomorrow it will be very , very scary to play that hole			0
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do , but hopefully i will play it as quickly as i can			0
" @entity13 , ranked 65th in the world , has won one tournament this year -- at january 's @entity71 , where he beat major winners @entity72 and @entity74 by one shot to claim the $ 2.7 million first prize			1
he will go into the weekend at the @entity77 tied for 25th place , trailing leader @entity79 by 11 shots			0
the @entity81 , a former world no. 1 , followed up his opening 65 with a 66 to be four clear of @entity84 teammate @entity83			0
the @entity85 was tied for second with 327th - ranked @entity87 of the @entity88 , who finished 90th in the @entity90 tournament last year .			2

" i 've never been so scared , " says golfer @entity13
@entity23 takes *evasive* *action* after *attracting* attention of hornets
he *plunges* into water *hazard* and rips off his shirt , which *attracted* the swarm
the *31* - year - old *regains* his *composure* to complete his round
