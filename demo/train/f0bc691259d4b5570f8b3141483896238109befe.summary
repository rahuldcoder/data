the future of the @entity1 lies in @entity3			1
this is not a geographic truism , but a strategic imperative			0
generations of @entity1 , distracted by far - flung crises , have long taken our own region for granted			1
this must change if the 21st century is to be an @entity3 century			2
the @entity1 , @entity12 and @entity13 are bound by a shared economic , environmental , demographic and cultural destiny			1
how we move forward together is key to our success			0
in recognition of our shared destiny , the three countries should create a @entity3 passport that would , over time , allow their citizens to travel , work , invest , learn and innovate anywhere in @entity3			1
work , tourist and student visas are necessities in the modern world to regulate the flow of people between sovereign states			0
in the @entity3 context , much like within the @entity34 , our economies and societies are far more integrated than our immigration system recognizes -- and a @entity3 passport , much like the @entity34 passport , would align our laws with reality			1
podcast : a @entity3 passport ? such a move would provide a dramatic break from @entity46 's historical negligence of its " near abroad , " which stems from a rare luxury			1
in contrast to other major continental powers through the centuries , the @entity1 has not had to worry much about its neighbors and devote the bulk of its military resources to protecting its borders			2
with no real threat next door , the @entity1 has felt free to roam elsewhere in the world , as unconstrained and secure as if we were an island nation			2
meanwhile , our neighbors bolster our prosperity			0
@entity13 and @entity12 are now the top two export markets for the @entity1 , and two of our top three trading partners overall			1
trade has exploded in the two decades since the passage of the @entity70 , or @entity70 , which has created an integrated manufacturing platform and labor market			0
@entity12 , a stalwart ally that embodies the best of our shared democratic values , has long been the no. 1 source of imported oil to the @entity1 , with @entity13 usually coming second or third			1
the @entity3 region has become the fastest - growing producer of oil and natural gas in the world and will surpass @entity85 and @entity86 within a decade or two as the global energy leader			2
this potential must be leveraged regionally , with cross-border infrastructure investments and environmental planning			0
even if @entity46 still thinks in terms of tidy lines separating nation states , mineral resources are about as influenced by such lines on a map as the water gushing down the @entity98			0
@entity13 , an emerging powerhouse with more than 100 million people , is striving to consolidate its democratic gains and become a predominantly middle - class society			2
the @entity1 has a strong stake in this effort			2
@entity13 is the linchpin to our relations with the countries of @entity109			2
the economic prosperity , education and security of @entity13 's people will help determine the overall competitiveness of @entity3 on the global stage			1
moreover , @entity1 on this side of the @entity117 must acknowledge the " @entity122 " in the @entity1 and treat @entity13 living here with the dignity and respect they deserve			1
the inception of @entity70 marked an important step toward leveraging these geographic realities for a shared @entity3 success			1
@entity70 has been a boon to our growth and competitiveness			0
integrated production platforms , sometimes spanning all three countries , have helped draw manufacturing back from competitors across the @entity134			0
but the promise of @entity70 has fallen short in a critical respect ; while trade and investment have grown , the barriers to movement have remained too high for the people who help drive and stand to benefit from that growth			0
as evidenced by the recent political firestorm over president @entity147 's executive move to allow more undocumented workers to avoid deportation , it would take farsighted and courageous political leadership in all three countries to press for a @entity3 passport			1
but the fact is that allowing @entity3 to move more effortlessly across the borders would help alleviate our contentious domestic immigration battles			0
we have more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in this country because we did n't create a realistic , legal avenue for the number of @entity13 who would -- and should , given our level of integration -- come to the @entity1 over time			1
moreover , by erecting a wall along the border and making crossings so difficult , costly and dangerous , we have interrupted the old " circularity " of migratory flows , trapping millions of workers on this side of the border			0
if we established a @entity3 passport and adapted our legal framework to economic realities , allowing people to move within our @entity3 economy , we would n't need to debate whether to offer more than 10 million people @entity1 citizenship			1
even a few years ago , immigration was a far more polarizing issue in states like @entity181			0
now the tide is slowly changing			0
more republicans are recognizing that their prior stance on immigration needs to change if they want to win over voters in the next presidential election			0
a @entity3 passport would reflect the unique relationship and shared interests among our nations			1
in the face of growing competition from rising powers elsewhere in the world , simply taking our geography for granted and focusing our attention elsewhere is no longer a viable option .			0

the future success of @entity3 depends partly on how the @entity1 , @entity12 and @entity13 work together
@entity202 , @entity203 : we should have a @entity3 passport , like the @entity34 passport
