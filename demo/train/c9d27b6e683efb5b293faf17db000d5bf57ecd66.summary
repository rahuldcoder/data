@entity0 -- @entity2 is sending a veteran politician , not a career diplomat , as its new ambassador to @entity6			1
six - term @entity8 senator @entity7 , 72 , will soon take up his diplomatic post in @entity0 , replacing @entity10 , who is stepping down to rejoin his family in @entity12			1
given his relative lack of @entity6 experience , some , in both the @entity13 and in @entity6 are wondering if @entity7 is a good choice			1
he has made eight trips to @entity6 and has met with to @entity6 leaders , but he is not considered a @entity6 hand			2
his strong suit is his extensive experience when it comes to trade issues			0
in his new role , he is expected to press @entity6 to play by internationally accepted rules regarding currency , intellectual property , labor and human rights and free trade			2
his past trade successes involving @entity6 have also been noted			0
" in the 1990s , he played a pivotal role in @entity6 's accession to the @entity37 and normalizing trade ties between our countries , " said @entity33 , a professor at @entity34			2
" to appoint a free trade supporter and a veteran senator can be viewed as a positive move from the @entity13 administration to encourage more trade			0
" knowledge = power ? over the past 25 years covering @entity6 , i have seen several @entity13 ambassadors come and go			0
they came with different personal and career backgrounds , politics and agenda			0
curiously , the envoy 's knowledge of @entity6 did not always equate to impact on policy - making			2
@entity6 - born and @entity58 - speaking @entity59 ( 1989 - 1991 ) and @entity60 ( 1991 - 1995 ) displayed deep knowledge of @entity6 history and culture , but because they were political outsiders in @entity2 , their advice often went unheeded			1
in contrast , retired senator @entity65 ( 1996 - 1999 ) knew little about @entity6 before his posting , but because he was a political insider , " he could walk into the @entity69 or @entity70 , meet with the president or with influential senators , and lobby , " recalled a political analyst in @entity0			1
' low key ' @entity10 @entity10 , 63 , was the first @entity13 of @entity6 descent to head the embassy in @entity0			1
under his two - and - a - half year watch , the embassy was embroiled in dramatic diplomatic rows but his common touch made him popular among ordinary @entity6			1
in february 2012 , a former police chief in @entity82 sought refuge in the @entity13 consulate in @entity85 , which ultimately led to the downfall of top politician @entity87			0
two months later , @entity88 , a blind activist , escaped from house arrest to seek refuge in the @entity0 embassy			0
@entity10 helped broker a deal that allowed @entity88 to travel to @entity92 to study			0
@entity6 netizens admired him for his low - key and frugal style			0
he will perhaps be best remembered for photographs taken before he landed in @entity0 , which showed him carrying his backpack and using vouchers to buy coffee at a @entity99 at the @entity12 airport			0
these pictures went viral in @entity6 's social media			2
reports of him flying economy class and turning down five - star hotel accommodation during business trips buttressed his unassuming public image			0
some local commentators taunted @entity10 for resorting to " publicity stunts " , but these vignettes went down well with a @entity6 public turned off by tales of corruption , extravagance and arrogance among their own officials			1
" the @entity6 loved @entity10 because he fulfilled the many dreams of @entity6 who still saw the @entity13 as a land of opportunity , " said a former diplomat who worked for @entity10			1
" they also feared him because his down - to - earth style and common touch reminded @entity6 people what many of their own government leaders were not			0
" many @entity6 credit @entity10 for cutting the waiting time for @entity13 visas to three to five days from 70 to 100 days when he took over			1
the improvement significantly increased @entity6 business and travel tourism to the @entity13 " his primary target was making the potential of @entity6 economic growth benefit the @entity13 people , " the diplomat added			0
@entity7 ' to - do list difficulties lie ahead for @entity7 as the two big powers wrestle a slew of thorny problems , including strategic mistrust , the volatile territorial issues pitting @entity6 against @entity13 allies @entity145 and the @entity147 , the @entity149 issue , and differences over trade and human rights			1
and @entity7 will be hard - pressed to keep @entity154 and @entity13 policy makers focused on @entity6 as they are distracted by myriad domestic and global issues			1
" he will have to keep @entity2 's interest piqued to keep the @entity13 - @entity6 relationship as one of the more important bilateral relationships out there , " said the former @entity13 diplomat			1
" he is going to have to use his relationships on the @entity70 and among the @entity2 elite to keep @entity6 issues at the forefront			1
" @entity166 , executive dean of the @entity167 at @entity168 in @entity169 , thinks @entity10 's weaknesses are @entity7 ' strengths			1
" @entity7 was a colleague of @entity154 , @entity172 and @entity173 , a friend of @entity174			0
forty years in @entity2 , so he knows everyone , " said @entity166			0
" @entity10 was an outsider in @entity2 and that was his inherent disadvantage			1
" what lessons can @entity7 draw from his predecessor ? outgoing @entity10 suggests that @entity7 travel extensively , especially to small villages in remote areas			1
" my sincere advice to him is to visit various places in @entity6 -- as many as he can -- and understand local customs and practices , " @entity10 said in a magazine interview on the eve of his departure			1
" @entity0 is not @entity6 and big cities ca n't be representative of @entity6			1
" during his relatively short tenure , @entity10 has traveled to @entity82 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 , where he talked with local officials and residents			0
@entity168 's @entity166 says the new ambassador should act as a bridge between the two countries			0
" while preaching @entity13 values , do n't alienate yourself from the @entity6 government and people , " he said			0
it seems that the @entity6 people are already talking about him			0
he 's been a hot topic of conversation on social media in the country since his appointment , with some having fun suggesting how to transliterate his name in @entity6			2
one suggests @entity215 , which literally means " assured to cough to death " , a tangential criticism of @entity0 's polluted air			2
some local netizens wonder whether the 72 - year - old incoming envoy could bear @entity0 's pernicious heavy smog			2
for his part , @entity7 , a keen distance runner during his time inside the @entity223 , may already have a head - start in ingratiating himself with @entity0			2
he said shortly after his confirmation that he has his " eye on the @entity0 marathon , " although he may want to wait and see what smog levels are like closer to the date .			0

@entity2 has chosen veteran politician with little diplomatic experience
senator @entity7 will soon take up post in @entity0 , replacing @entity10
@entity10 faced dramatic political crises but was popular among ordinary @entity6
@entity7 's @entity2 *connections* likely to be his biggest asset , analysts say
