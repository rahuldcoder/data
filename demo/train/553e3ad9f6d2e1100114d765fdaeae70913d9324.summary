@entity1 , @entity0 -- the startling discovery that three women had been held captive for a decade inside a @entity1 home has answered key questions from their families and raised a slew of others			1
here are some of the most pressing : what was life like for the victims ? ropes and chains taken as evidence from the modest , two - story home on @entity19 where the women were held were used to restrain the women , police chief @entity14 told @entity22 's " today			1
" " we have confirmation that they were bound , " he said			0
but public safety director @entity26 said it was not clear what they were used for			0
@entity30 , chief assistant prosecutor for @entity1 , announced wednesday that charges against @entity32 include four counts of kidnapping -- one each for @entity32 , @entity32 , @entity32 and a 6 - year - old girl who was born to @entity37 in captivity			1
those charges also address the question of whether the women were sexually abused			2
@entity32 , 52 , faces three counts of rape , @entity30 said , adding that a grand jury could later indict him on additional charges			1
two of @entity32 's brothers who also were arrested after the women 's escape monday evening will not be charged , according to the prosecutor			1
@entity30 said " there is no evidence these two individuals had any involvement			0
" as to the victims , two of them returned home wednesday			0
but they have not made public statements as they seek to be reacquainted with family and friends			2
the interior of their prison was unremarkable , according to @entity65			0
the sometime bandmate of the homeowner , suspect @entity32 , said he entered the house about two years ago to to help deliver a washer and dryer and saw " a normal environment			1
" " it did n't seem to be a place where women were being held against their will , " he said			2
" of course , mind you , i did n't go throughout the entire house			2
i was just at the beginning of the house , in the living room , but it seemed normal			2
" the one - bathroom house has a living area of 1,436 square feet , with a living room inside the front door , a dining room and a kitchen on the ground floor , according to @entity90 records			2
the four bedrooms are all on the second floor			0
because the ground is sandy and loose in the area , basements in the area tend to be smaller than the footprints of the houses above , which are usually damp and cold in the winter			0
the basement of the house , which was built in 1890 and renovated in 1956 , is not finished			2
timeline : from missing to liberated how did their years of captivity go unnoticed ? looking back on it , would police or neighbors done anything differently to increase the chances of discovering the imprisoned women ? and was monday 's escape by @entity37 the first time in a decade that any of the women had been able to signal anyone in the neighborhood about their plight ? some neighbors of @entity32 have second - guessed themselves , asking if they could have prevented the horrors had they noticed details that now seem out of place			1
for example , neighbor @entity120 -- who has described @entity32 as an " outgoing person , very nice guy " -- asked why he did n't question why the single man frequently carried bags full of @entity126 's food into the house where he appeared to live alone , or why he frequently steered conversation away from it			1
" now that i think of it , he did n't want nobody back there , " said @entity130 , who said he has known @entity32 since junior high school and lived near him for some 22 years			1
neighbors @entity135 and @entity137 told @entity2 that they had called police in recent years to report separate incidents at the home			1
@entity137 said she and others saw a naked woman in the home and called police			2
@entity145 , @entity137 's sister , told a different version tuesday night on @entity2 's " @entity147			0
" she said after seeing the woman , they told their mother , not police			2
the mother , @entity151 , told @entity152 that she did n't call police , either			0
another neighbor , @entity135 -- @entity151 's brother -- says he called police in 2011 when he heard yelling in the @entity32 home			1
officers left when no one answered the door , @entity135 says			0
if neighbors ' accounts were true and the police really heard screaming and simply knocked on the door and left when no one answered , then " law enforcement clearly dropped the ball , " attorney @entity168 told @entity2			1
" it was almost like a @entity172 situation , " prominent attorney @entity169 added			0
" there 's got to be much more to this story			0
" @entity1 officials denied claims that they had called police to report suspicious activity at the home			1
" media reports of multiple calls to the @entity184 reporting suspicious activity and the mistreatment of women at 2207 @entity19 are false , " spokeswoman @entity180 said in an e-mailed statement			1
other officials said call records contained no evidence that neighbors had called police to report unusual activity at the home			1
police say they went to the address once in 2000 , before the abductions , when @entity32 reported a fight outside his home , and in 2004 , after two of the three women had disappeared			1
the latter visit was to investigate a complaint that @entity32 had left a child alone on the bus he was to have been driving			1
no one answered the door at the home , and investigators later interviewed him elsewhere , police say			0
are there more victims ? police have used at least one cadaver dog to search for human remains ; they said they have so far found none			0
they also have said they want to know whether there could be any additional victims in the case			0
investigators had speculated that the disappearances of @entity37 , @entity32 and another girl , @entity222 , may have been connected			1
@entity224 ' family last saw her in july 2007 , when she was 14			0
now the @entity222 family is hoping that the @entity1 investigation will yield information about @entity222 , her aunt , @entity229 , said			1
" we 're hoping for a miracle , " she said			0
an @entity233 spokeswoman said investigators will question the women found monday in hopes of learning something about @entity222 ' disappearance			0
@entity239 said she was hoping that her sister @entity240 was among the women who were freed monday			0
then 18 and five months pregnant , @entity242 disappeared in 1995 while walking toward her boyfriend 's house on the same block where one of the @entity32 brothers lived and a few streets away from where the other women were last seen , she said			1
" she was going home for the night and she disappeared , " she said			0
" we just really want to find out where she is and is she ok			0
" most missing person cases of such duration end badly , according to authorities			0
according to court documents , @entity32 's former wife accused him of repeatedly abusing her , including breaking her nose twice , breaking two ribs , dislocating her shoulder twice and knocking out a tooth			1
@entity263 also accused @entity32 of causing a blood clot on her brain , according to the 2005 documents			1
a judge granted a protection order but lifted it three months later after court delays and hearings @entity32 did not attend , according to the documents			1
@entity272 , @entity263 's father , told @entity2 that when @entity32 and his daughter moved into the house on @entity19 , @entity32 would not let let any other family members enter the home			1
after the couple broke up , his daughter moved back with her parents and said she never wanted to talk about @entity32 , @entity272 said			2
she died last year at age 48 , according to @entity282 records			0
@entity32 's uncle @entity283 also recalled his nephew 's messy breakup			2
@entity32 seemed to live alone after that , except for occasional visits by , among others , his two brothers			1
he also had grandchildren -- at least five , he 'd recently noted on @entity291			0
some news outlets have reported that at least one of the three women gave birth more than once during their years in captivity			2
those news outlets cited unnamed sources			0
investigators have not publicly confirmed or denied those assertions , saying it will take time to piece together a complete picture of what happened inside the house .			0

new : @entity32 is charged with kidnapping , rape ; his brothers are not
ropes , chains removed from @entity1 house , but the women have not commented
