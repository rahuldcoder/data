@entity0 , @entity1 -- the search for victims of this week 's coal mine fire in @entity1 is now over , with a final death toll of 301 , @entity1 government officials said saturday			1
authorities believe they have now recovered the bodies of all the workers who perished in the @entity0 mine when the fire erupted tuesday			1
the investigation into what caused the deadliest disaster in @entity1 mining history continues , the @entity13 said			1
the final bodies were pulled out saturday afternoon , @entity1 energy minister @entity18 said			1
however , as the recovery effort comes to an end , controversy over prime minister @entity22 's response to the tragedy refuses to blow over			1
on friday , police in the western city used tear gas , plastic pellets and a water cannon on protesters angered by the government 's response			1
the protesters , dressed mostly in black , chanted " do n't sleep , @entity0 , remember your dead ! " as they passed through city streets a few miles from the disaster site , trying to reach a statue honoring miners			1
amid a rising tide of discontent , local authorities have banned protests in @entity0 and apparently clamped down on those taking part			2
lawyers ' representatives told @entity1 broadcaster @entity48 that eight lawyers and 25 other citizens were detained saturday			2
the lawyers were in town to try to help represent families of the dead miners			0
@entity56 , the governer of @entity58 province , where @entity0 is located , declined to say how many people had been detained over the protests			2
but he told reporters that the authorities took the decision friday to ban rallies and demonstrations in @entity0 in order to maintain peace and security			2
he said that " this is not to prevent freedom of expression			0
" distrust of the government is running high in certain sectors of society , with some voicing doubts about the official count of those missing , while others question the fact no one has yet taken responsibility for the tragedy			2
some are also critical of the authorities ' use of tear gas and water cannon against demonstrators			0
@entity22 's missteps public anger has been fueled in part by @entity22 's own missteps while visiting the scene of the disaster wednesday			2
first , @entity22 's comments to relatives of dead and injured miners , in which he described the disaster as par for the course in a dangerous business , were seen as highly insensitive and drew scathing criticism			2
then video taken on the same day in @entity0 showed @entity22 telling a man " do n't be nasty , " according to the footage aired friday by @entity48			1
the remarks initially reported and translated by @entity48 were confirmed by a @entity2 native @entity1 speaker			1
" what happened , happened			0
it is from @entity112 ... if you boo the country 's prime minister , you get slapped , " @entity22 is heard saying			1
that was after another video clip emerged showing a crowd outside a grocery store angrily booing @entity22			0
as the prime minister entered the crowded store , he appeared to put his arm around the neck of a man who was later identified as a miner			1
after the confrontation , the video captured what appeared to be @entity22 's security guards beating the same man to the floor			2
the miner said later that @entity22 slapped him , possibly by mistake			0
he wants an apology for the way he was treated by the prime minister 's staff			1
in addition , a photograph surfaced wednesday of an aide to @entity22 kicking a protester , an image that quickly became a symbol of the anger felt by many against the government , and amid mounting questions over safety practices at the mine			1
@entity151 , a spokesman for the ruling @entity152 , or @entity152 , dismissed the grocery store incident and said the image of the aide , @entity155 , kicking the protester was misleading			1
@entity155 was quoted by @entity1 's semiofficial @entity158 news agency thursday as saying that he had been deeply saddened by the previous day 's events			1
" i am sad that i could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation , insults and attacks that i was subjected to that day , " he reportedly said			0
questions over safety chambers the mine complex exploded in flames for unknown reasons tuesday -- trapping many miners deep underground			0
among other issues , mine officials indicated friday that workers may not have had access to an emergency refuge where they could have sheltered from the flames and choking fumes			2
site manager @entity179 told reporters that the mine had closed one emergency refuge when excavation work moved to a lower area			2
miners were building , but had not finished , a new safety chamber at the lower level , he said			0
the owner of the company , @entity189 , said the mine met the highest standards laid out by the law in @entity1			1
the company , he said , had no legal obligation to build safety chambers			0
asked about that issue , minister of labor and social security @entity197 defended @entity1 's workplace safety act and said it was set up within the framework of @entity203 regulations , according to @entity204			1
" this is a dynamic area , " he said , adding that it is the duty of each company to ensure workers ' safety needs are met			0
" could people be sent to death because a certain sentence is not in the regulations ? " he said			0
@entity213 said it had dropped @entity189 and a fellow @entity215 manager , @entity214 , from an advisory panel in its mining faculty , following protests and an occupation by students at the university , @entity204 reported			0
@entity18 , speaking to journalists earlier saturday , when the death toll stood at 299 , said 15 bodies had been recovered overnight			1
most have been returned to their families but dna testing is being carried out on the remains of 13 people , the energy minister said			0
fumes from a new fire , a few hundred yards from the one that broke out tuesday , hindered search and recovery efforts saturday , @entity18 said			2
initial reports said the main fire was sparked by a transformer explosion , but @entity151 told reporters friday that the cause of the fire was still unknown			0
asked what had happened , he said , " we do n't know either			0
never seen anything like this before			0
we are trying to find out			0
" political bonfire hundreds have also taken to the streets this week in anti-government protests in @entity251 and @entity252 , with police answering , in some cases , with water cannons and tear gas			0
as @entity22 took a stroll through the city , onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of " resign , prime minister ! " foreign minister @entity263 defended @entity22 in an interview with @entity2 's @entity265 on thursday			1
" he was feeling all these pains in his heart , " he said			0
" everybody knows that our prime minister is always with the people , and always feels the pain of the people			1
otherwise , he would n't get such a high support in eight elections in ( the ) last 10 years			0
" but the disaster opened up an old political wound			0
opposition politician @entity278 from the @entity58 region , which includes @entity0 , filed a proposal in late april to investigate @entity1 mines after repeated deadly accidents			1
@entity22 's government rejected the proposal			2
it claimed that the mine , owned by @entity287 , had passed recent inspections			0
a @entity1 engineers ' association criticized mine ventilation and safety equipment this week as being " insufficient and old			1
" a lack of safety inspections has caused 100 coal mines to be closed in the last three years , according to @entity1 's @entity296			1
president @entity298 , speaking as he visited @entity0 on thursday , said he was sure the investigation already begun would " shed light " on what regulations are needed			2
" whatever is necessary will be done , " he said			0
despair , anger , dwindling hope after @entity1 coal mine fire @entity307 and @entity308 reported from western @entity1 , and @entity309 wrote and reported from @entity310			1
@entity2 's @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			0

" if you boo the country 's prime minister , you get slapped , " @entity1 's @entity320 says in video
