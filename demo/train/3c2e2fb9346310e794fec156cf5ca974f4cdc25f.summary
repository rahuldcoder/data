-- ah , the confirmed bachelor			0
think @entity2 , @entity3 or even old @entity5 's @entity4			0
we anticipate whom they 'll turn up with on the red carpet at the next @entity5 premiere or which starlet will be photographed hanging from their arm as they slip out of the hottest , newest restaurant or nightclub			1
though it was n't celebrated by larger society , it used to be that gay men once enjoyed that same freedom to play the field			1
but thanks to our freedom - fighting brethren , not anymore			1
do n't get me wrong ; it 's not that i long for the good old days when gay men and women had to hide and lie about themselves and their partners by calling them " friend " or " roommate			1
" not at all ! but as same - sex marriage is becoming legalized in places like @entity33 and beyond , many of us suddenly have to face the reality and the question that many of our straight friends have always faced : " when are you going to settle down and get married ? " more and more these days , i hear gay couples lamenting over it in restaurants , at work and at dinner parties			1
my friends call me with their own similar accounts			0
lucky for them , they do n't get called on the carpet over it in public			2
but i did , literally on a red carpet			1
and it lives in print and on the internet for all to see			0
it was my first red carpet experience earlier this summer after coming out publicly in my book " @entity59			1
" it did n't go well when a @entity62 reporter inquired about my own marriage intentions			1
here 's the exchange : so there we were , chatting with newly out @entity0 anchor @entity67 at monday 's @entity69 event , and just like annoying @entity70 , we asked if he and his partner of four years are planning on tying the knot			1
after a long , awkward pause , @entity67 laughed and said , " listen , i am not planning on getting married			1
i 'm not planning on not getting married			2
" you mean , you 're asking me if i 'm planning on getting married in the near future ? " yes , that 's what we 're asking , we pressed			2
" since i was a kid i 've always wanted to get married			2
and i think that now that , you know , there is a possibility for me to get married , i think that , yeah , one day i would like to get married , and maybe soon , " @entity67 said			1
" i have no immediate plans , but i say why not ? i am in a very happy , very solid relationship , so sure , one day i 'd like to get married , and i might do it			2
" obviously @entity67 was not comfortable talking about this , but just like @entity70 never takes the hint , we blustered on with questions about this hypothetical wedding			1
when our conversation ended and @entity67 was walking away , we overheard him say to his rep , " did i dance around that enough ? " i warned you it did n't go well			1
i was n't ready for that question from a persistent reporter			0
nor am i ready for it from family members , friends , neighbors or random people who approach me in public			2
honestly , i had n't pondered marriage since i came to terms with my sexuality almost two decades ago			2
but it really hit home for me when to my and my boyfriend 's surprise the @entity110 named me a 2011 media power bachelor and i got the news in an e-mail that my colleague @entity116 had tied the knot with her long - time boyfriend , @entity118			0
while the power bachelor thing was fun , the @entity116 thing got me thinking			0
i have n't had the opportunity to ask her directly why she decided to get married after 29 years of unwedded bliss			0
maybe it had something to do with her new grandson and her public support of gay marriage			1
perhaps @entity33 's new marriage law had greased the skids for ms. @entity133			0
whatever her reasons , @entity116 's last tweet before running off with @entity118 was a sign for me			0
it simply reads , " gone fishing			0
" so just as i did when i came out publicly this summer , i 'll get ahead of all those " fishing " for an answer about my marriage plans			0
while i respect the gay couples who have or are planning on tying the knot soon , the truth is , just like straight people , not all gay people want to or should get married			1
but perhaps the best answer and the one closest to my own comes from a personal quote on the website @entity151 from another confirmed bachelor , @entity153			0
" people always like to make up stories			0
i am not planning on getting married			0
then again , i might wake up tomorrow and decide to get married ! " thanks @entity153 .			0

as same - sex marriage is legalized , many are asked , " when are you getting married ? "
@entity67 was asked about this on the red carpet by @entity62
" not all gay people want to or should get married , " @entity67 said
