the battle over right - to - work legislation in @entity2 has renewed debate over labor policy and the role of unions in the @entity8 economy			1
on tuesday , the state @entity9 passed two bills that would make @entity2 the 24th @entity8 state to enact right - to - work laws			1
here 's a quick look at the issue : what 's going on ? @entity2 's storied labor movement and its allies mobilized last week to stop @entity20 - backed legislation that would give workers the right to opt out of union membership and , critics say , weaken unions			1
lawmakers last week gave initial approval to " right - to - work " bills in a surprise move that provoked thousands of labor supporters to descend on the state @entity32 for protests that led to eight arrests			1
more protests are scheduled for tuesday			0
opponents accuse @entity20 of abusing the legislative system to rush through the bills without public input			0
supporters say the legislation would help improve economic competitiveness in @entity2 which , despite some recovery , still has the nation 's sixth - worst unemployment rate and median household incomes that lag the nation			1
what is right to work ? " right to work " is the commonly used term for laws that make it illegal to require that employees join a union or pay the equivalent of union dues to get or keep a job			1
under such laws , employees can still form unions , engage in collective bargaining and go on strike			2
currently , 23 states , most of them in the @entity66 and @entity67 , have right - to - work laws			1
in those states , union membership stood at 6.48 % in 2011 , according to the @entity8 @entity72			1
in states without right - to - work laws , 10.8 % of the workforce belonged to unions			1
analysis : why @entity8 's unions are losing power when did right - to - work laws first appear ? @entity81 was the first state to pass right - to - work legislation , in 1943 , according to the @entity83			1
@entity84 and @entity85 followed in 1946			0
then @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 did so in the right - to - work boom year of 1947			2
according to the @entity83 , the laws were a response to the growing influence of the labor movement during an era when union membership was rapidly growing -- more than doubling in percentage terms between 1935 and 1945 , according to the @entity101			2
the most recent state to enact a right - to - work law was @entity2 's neighbor , @entity105 , in 2012			1
before that was @entity107 in 1976			0
what do supporters say ? right - to - work supporters argue that it makes states more attractive to business , creates jobs and gives employees more choices			1
supporters cite studies suggesting that job growth and private - sector compensation in right - to - work states have increased more rapidly than in other states			1
" the case for right - to - work has always rested on the importance of defending worker freedom , but right - to - work laws also have a proven track record of encouraging economic growth , " @entity121 of the @entity122 wrote monday			1
and critics ? opponents cite studies indicating that wages and growth are lower in right - to - work states , and they say that such legislation is little more than an effort to bleed unions in the name of worker freedom and choice			1
" there is scant evidence these laws create jobs , help workers , or are good for a state 's economy , as supporters claim , " analysts for the liberal think tank @entity143 wrote earlier this year			2
" instead , these laws weaken unions and thereby hurt workers , the middle class , and local economies			2
" critics also say that such laws allow nonunion workers to " freeload " -- gain the benefits of union representation without shouldering the burden of paying for it			2
@entity2 bills weakening union power signed into law why is it coming up now ? for one , union influence is waning in @entity2 , as it has been nationwide for decades			0
in november , voters rejected a referendum that would have blocked right - to - work legislation			2
and @entity20 control the state house , @entity171 and governor 's office , reducing the influence of labor in legislative affairs			0
still , gov. @entity177 had said the issue was not on his agenda until recently , when legislative leaders began to press their case			0
he told @entity182 , editorial page editor of the @entity183 , that he had tried to mediate a solution to avoid the bill coming to a head			0
" that was n't very successful , so i said , ' this is being put on my agenda , ' " @entity177 said			0
" i thought it better to try to get something done one way or another , and get the issue behind us			0
" he and other supporters now say the legislation is critical to the state 's economic success			2
" like it or not , the 49 other states in the union are competing with us for businesses and workers , " @entity177 wrote on his blog			0
" and across the nation , 23 states have enacted freedom - to - work laws -- including neighboring @entity105			1
though @entity2 is the comeback state , we do n't exist in a vacuum			0
our successes today could turn to failures tomorrow , so we need to maintain our competitive edge			0
" what 's next ? the bills now go to @entity177 for his signature , and he has said he will sign them			0
@entity219 have suggested they may challenge the legislation in court because @entity20 lawmakers skipped the usual committee hearings in passing the bills			0
the legislation can not be overturned by a public referendum because they were in appropriations measures .			0
