" @entity15 spokeswoman @entity14 was asked by reporters whether the @entity10 would consider releasing the three remaining members of the " @entity18 , " a group of men convicted of espionage in the late 1990s , for @entity24 contractor @entity22 , who is jailed in @entity25			1

@entity24 has said he was in the country working on a @entity10 government project setting up satellite internet connections			0
@entity25 officials tell @entity0 the @entity10 refuses to engage on the issue			1
@entity14 said the administration remains opposed to such a trade and stressed that @entity4 's case was an extraordinary measure to free a prisoner of war			1
what 's next for @entity4 ? the @entity13 administration justified the operation due to @entity4 's health and safety , which appeared in jeopardy			1
" in any case , whether it 's @entity22 or @entity54 or others who are detained @entity10 citizens , we take every step possible to make the case and to -- take steps to ensure their return home to the @entity10 , " she said			1

and in 1985 , president @entity84 approved secret arms sales to @entity83 in an effort to secure the release of seven @entity10 hostages being held by @entity83 in @entity89			2
that was the core of what became the @entity92			0
the deal for @entity4 also raises questions about the @entity10 and present day @entity83			2
