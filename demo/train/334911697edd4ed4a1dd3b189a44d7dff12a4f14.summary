-- sad but true : much of what we do online , we do for vainglorious reasons			2
we tweet a joke not only to make others laugh , but also to watch the sweet @entity6 come rolling in			2
we post a link not just to start a discussion or expand our @entity11 friends ' minds , but also to rack up the comments and likes			0
so when someone lifts our content without credit -- even just a link or gem we found in the morass of the interwebs -- we are rightfully angered			1
look , one of the @entity23 's greatest powers is its sheer volume , the seemingly infinite library of well - argued political views , vivid picture galleries , real - time citizen journalism and " @entity30 " fan trailers			1
and what our social networks bring to the table are reapers and curators who help point us to the best content			1
finding ( or coming up with ) cool or hilarious stuff and sharing it with others is a skill , one that should be appropriately lauded with that sweet ego - building nectar we call credit			1
we 're not about to delve into the ins and outs of intellectual property law and copyright infringement and all that jazz			1
@entity48 , we 're here to talk about the much milder offense of sharing content without a nod to the ahead - of - the - curve person who shined a spotlight on it in the first place			1
now , this can get a bit tricky , since it 's not always necessary , or even worthwhile , to give a citation			0
so let 's review a few truths about reposting			0
some platforms make it effortless			0
on those platforms , you look especially jerkish for not giving credit			1
@entity67 is a prime example -- the retweet function lets you share another person 's quip or link with almost zero effort			0
so nabbing that @entity74 article or whatever and putting it in your feed as your own is just a bastardization of how the site 's supposed to work			0
forced citations are actually a big part of @entity81 's design , as founder @entity82 explained last weekend at the @entity84 conference in @entity85 , @entity86			1
some people decry the blog site 's lack of a built - in comment function -- users wishing to add their commentary must " reblog " another @entity81 's post so that it shows up in their own blog , where they can add their biting remarks			1
the idea , @entity82 said , was to ask people to own up to their takes on others ' work -- no anonymous flaming or trolling			0
" socially adept social networkers use " via " like mad			2
just tweet or post or blog about the cool thing you stumbled upon and drop in " via [ the name or handle of the friend who shared it first , with a link to their relevant social network profile ]			2
" a couple of exceptions : a ) if you heard about the link directly from the source , e.g. if you follow @ cnntech and are excited about one of their stories , well , duh , the link itself will be giving the source proper snaps			0
b ) if your friend gave credit to a tipster whom you do n't know , no need to do serial citations ( " @entity134 via @ myfriend via @ herfriend via @ anotherrando			1
" ) it 's a waste of space and those tertiary connections will never know			0
do n't bother giving credit if the item is blowing up on the @entity23			1
most recently , the share du jour was that unspeakably annoying @entity142 " friday " video			0
if you posted such a thing after it 'd bubbled up into a frenzy , you 'd probably have eight different friends you could credit , all of whom just heard about it from someone else			2
actually , if something is already reaching epic viral heights , do n't add to the boring cacophony			2
doing so only makes you look hopelessly out of the loop			0
stand out by reposting something clever and relatively obscure			0
or , you know , skip the ctrl - @entity158 altogether and say something original .			1

when someone lifts our content or reposts a gem we found without credit , we 're mad
if your friend gave credit to a tipster whom you do n't know , no need to do serial citations
skip the ctrl - @entity158 altogether and say something original
