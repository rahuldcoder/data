an early and severe start to the flu season has many health experts concerned			2
on friday , the @entity3 reported 47 states are experiencing widespread activity , although it appears to be decreasing in some areas			1
according to the @entity3 , this is the most flu cases they 've seen at this time of year in more than a decade			1
twenty pediatric flu - related deaths have occurred since the start of the season			2
the @entity3 does not track adult flu - related deaths			1
the peak of the season , which usually happens in february , may be yet to come for most states -- officials said friday it may be a week or two before it becomes clear whether cases have peaked			0
here are some common flu questions from readers answered : why is this year 's flu causing more severe cases ? the type of flu that is going around is called @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , which is often linked to more serious diseases than other flu varieties , dr. @entity23 , director of the @entity24 at the @entity25 , told @entity32			1
people could get more complications from this particular strain , which would make them sick for a longer period of time			2
how is this flu season different than last year 's ? the 2011 - 2012 flu season began late and was relatively mild compared with previous seasons , according to the @entity3			1
in fact , the season 's peak set a record for the lowest and shortest since surveillance began			0
the number of pediatric flu - related deaths was also low last year			1
the @entity3 reported 26 children under the age of 18 had died by may 25 , 2012			1
as a comparison , 122 pediatric flu - related deaths were reported during the 2010 - 2011 season			2
how many people usually die from the flu each year ? the flu kills about 36,000 people a year in the @entity57 , according to the @entity3 , though the range varies greatly each year			1
most deaths are caused by complications from the flu			2
children under 2 years old , adults over 65 , pregnant women and @entity57 @entity64 are at a greater risk of suffering from flu complications , according to the @entity3			1
people with medical conditions like asthma , lung disease , heart disease and people with weakened immune systems are also at risk			1
how does someone go from having the flu to dying ? most of the people who die have underlying illnesses or a weakened immune system , says dr. @entity80 , @entity32 's chief medical correspondent			1
the flu can weaken the immune system even more , which can lead to a complication like a bacterial infection			1
" it is that bacterial infection that most often causes death , especially in the younger population , " @entity80 says			0
so if i get the flu , should i go to the emergency room ? most people with the flu do n't have to -- they 'll recover on their own in five to seven days with plenty of rest and fluids , says dr. @entity99 , internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at @entity102 in @entity103			1
however , you should go to the er immediately if : -- you have difficulty breathing or have pain in your chest -- you ca n't keep fluids down because of nausea and vomiting -- your fever or cough gets better , then worsens " let 's say you have the flu , you get better , you think everything is all clear , " @entity80 says			2
" then a couple days later , the fever comes back			0
that means you may now have a bacterial infection			0
" does this mean the flu vaccine is n't working ? the flu vaccine is only about 60 % effective , according to the @entity3			1
how well the vaccine works can vary based on your age and health , as well as how good the " match " of the vaccine is to this year 's flu strain			1
each year , the vaccine is made from three strains of the influenza virus that researchers suspect will be the most active			2
so far , according to the @entity3 , this year 's vaccine matches well with the most predominant type of flu spreading in the @entity57 , but is less well matched to the no. 2 type of virus			1
the vaccine usually works best in young , healthy people , according to dr. @entity139 , chairman of the preventative medicine department at @entity141			2
but even if you do get the flu , the vaccine can protect against harsher complications			2
learn more about the flu vaccine 's effectiveness will the flu vaccine make me sick ? the virus used in the flu shot is a dead virus , @entity80 says			0
" you can not get the flu from a flu shot			0
" but your body 's immune system will react , and that can make you feel pain in your arm or feel less than 100 % for a few days			0
is there a flu vaccine shortage ? while @entity32 has heard reports of vaccine shortages in some areas , manufacturers say there are vaccines available for anyone who wants to get a flu shot			0
there was a temporary delay in new shipments of the antiviral medicine @entity173 due to an increased demand , according to a spokeswoman			0
@entity173 can help reduce the severity and length of flu symptoms if taken early			0
learn more about the reported shortages i 'm sold ! is it too late to get the vaccine ? in one word : no. keep in mind that it takes about two weeks for antibodies to develop in your body and provide protection against the virus , the @entity3 says			1
opinion : next time , get the vaccine early how can i avoid getting the flu in the first place ? it 's disturbing to think about , but flu germs can spread up to 6 feet through coughs and sneezes			0
they can also live on surfaces for up to eight hours			0
dr. @entity200 , a pediatrician and mother of two , recommends practicing good " social distancing			0
" this means canceling parties or dates if someone is sick and avoiding large crowds ( like at the movies or going out to dinner ) if your community has been hit hard by the virus			0
it 's also a good idea to practice proper hand - washing -- for at least 20 seconds several times a day			0
and wiping handles , counters and remotes daily with hot soapy water or disinfectant will kill any germs that linger			0
