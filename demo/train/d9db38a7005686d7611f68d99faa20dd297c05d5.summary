@entity0 , @entity1 -- the history of journalism is not , as supporters of official regulation pretend , a long march toward state involvement			1
campaigners for a free press have fought for centuries against state interference			1
their certainty that journalism sanitized by official regulators is incompatible with liberty is recognized by such trivial instruments of democracy as the @entity20 @entity19			1
the phone - hacking scandal has exposed the depths some journalists plumbed in pursuit of saleable stories			1
but it has done nothing to undermine this truth : regulation underpinned by statute would squander the fruits of struggle and betray the cause of progress			1
should the press be more regulated ? share your views the @entity39 campaign claims to have discovered alchemy by which state underpinning of press regulation can be rendered safe			1
in fact it parades an oxymoron : independent regulation backed by statute			2
it is offensive to the democratic principle that a free press is a crucial guardian of ordinary citizens ' rights			1
worse ; it would do nothing to protect the victims of phone hacking			1
why @entity59 's shamed newspapers need regulating the @entity60 has made stark one conclusion that is profoundly inconvenient to proponents of statutory underpinning			0
@entity64 of @entity65 , expresses it well : " all or virtually all the egregious behavior which has given rise to calls for better press regulation is either actionable or contrary to the criminal law			1
breach of privacy , copyright , confidence , harassment , data theft , forgery , hacking of computers and phones , contempt of court / @entity83 -- these are all covered by existing law			2
" so , one powerful argument against state - sponsored regulation of the press is that appropriate remedies -- and penalties -- exist already for all of the offenses that have been discussed at the @entity60			1
journalism is subject to more than 50 laws ranging from the @entity94 ( 1911 ) to the @entity95 ( 2010 ) and including libel laws that have made this country destination of choice for " libel tourists			2
" so , it is reasonable to ask what hacked off really wants			0
in fact its supporters have made that clear			0
they yearn for journalism in which the public interest is defined without any reference to what the public is interested in : reporting that would impose on the majority the tastes of a narrow cultural and intellectual elite			1
in the words of @entity119 , my fellow campaigner for press freedom , " [ their ] demand for ' ethical journalism ' is essentially a cultural manifesto masquerading as morality			1
why should @entity59 have press regulation at all ? @entity20 has none , and its newspaper culture is committed to ethical reporting			1
but there will be stronger regulation			2
the @entity133 's failure to investigate effectively hacking at the @entity134 -- compounded by its criticism of @entity136 for pursuing a story of luminous importance -- guaranteed it			2
but @entity139 has no mandate to impose state - sanctioned regulation			2
he has responsibility without power : government and parliament must decide			0
they should not be tempted by a solution three @entity148 since 1945 have rejected			0
a sanctimonious alliance of celebrities and illiberal academics urges them in that direction			0
they would be utterly wrong to take it			0
state involvement in the regulation of journalism destroys public trust			1
before the internet , newspapers were trusted most when they stood apart from the state and spoke on behalf of their readers			0
today the internet is cherished for the same reason			0
and , cherish it or not , pragmatists should note that it makes statutory regulation of newspapers an absurdly old - fashioned idea			2
supporters of state - regulation castigate its opponents as " first amendment fundamentalists			2
" they mean that we support the @entity20 @entity19 's guarantee that government may make no law abridging the freedom of the press			2
i believe @entity59 should adopt a comparable guarantee			0
state supervision of newspapers offends their readers and journalism serves democracy best when its values are those the public consider decent			1
regulation underpinned by statute might satisfy a short - term appetite to avenge the suffering of innocent victims			1
it would please the few misguided mps who still imagine that the press was wrong to shine light into the murky world of parliamentary expenses			2
but no matter how benignly intended or carefully designed it would have consequences worse than any good it could do			0
as @entity209 , former @entity59 ambassador to the @entity20 , explained to the @entity60 : " once you allow the state into this area , whatever the best intentions may have been , you are by definition standing on the top of a slippery slope			0
twenty , 25 years later , things change , politics change			0
it is quite possible a less permissive and liberal state , less conscious of our freedoms , might try to take advantage of that legislation to do things that would be offensive to the principle of freedom of expression			1
" soldiers call it mission creep , and statutory regulation would not just provide a tool for misguided politicians at home			0
authoritarian rulers everywhere would exploit the slightest hint of state involvement in the regulation of the @entity59 press			1
" look , " they would gloat , " the mother of democracy understands the need for the state to ensure that journalists behave			0
" plainly authoritarians of right and left share a desire to regulate what the electorate may read			0
shocking is the possibility that sincere liberals may soon find themselves tainted by an outcome they should despise			0
were the superb work the @entity136 did to expose phone hacking to result in state supervised regulation of newspapers , the injustice would be grotesque			1
an outcome that great newspaper deplores in every corner of the world can not be a proper conclusion to its campaign			0
i do not forecast an apocalypse , just a slow descent into controlled speech alien to the @entity59 tradition			0
it may be humanely directed , but the ultimate price of a statutory backstop to regulation of the newspaper industry is a docile press			1
far better to cherish raucous , impertinent journalism that can speak truth to power on behalf of its readers and entertain them enough to secure their loyalty			0
a few individuals who already have our collective sympathy and who have received or will receive richly deserved compensation might enjoy the spectacle of state - sanctioned regulation			0
we would all be losers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity289 .			1

@entity289 : regulation is offensive to principle that free press is guardian of citizens ' rights
it would also do nothing to protect the victims of phone hacking , he adds
@entity289 : journalism serves democracy when its values are those public consider decent
