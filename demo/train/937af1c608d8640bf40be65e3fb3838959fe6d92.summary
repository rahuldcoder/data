@entity0 -- it is the most high - profile meeting in all of @entity3 this year			0
@entity5 's president @entity4 will spend three days in @entity6 on an official state visit this week , getting a considerable amount of time with @entity10 , @entity6 's new prime minister			1
the two leaders represent not only the two most populous countries on @entity13 -- accounting for a third of the world 's population -- they are also the faces of stark changes in their home countries			1
both are new , strong , willful leaders with an agenda for reform			0
both have made moves to attack a culture of corruption , and to build their economies			0
and both seem to have designs on being stronger players in their backyards			0
what will their meeting mean for relations between these two @entity3 giants ? made in @entity5 & @entity6 in an editorial published in the @entity38 newspaper wednesday , @entity5 's @entity4 described how his country could exchange its expertise in infrastructure and manufacturing for @entity6 's advancements in information technology and pharmaceuticals			1
" the combination of ' the world 's factory ' and ' the world 's back office ' will produce the most competitive production base and the most attractive consumer market , " wrote @entity46 would be an upgrade in current relations , where @entity5 has a significant surplus in bilateral trade			1
@entity10 , in turn , in a press conference tuesday talked up the potential of a great partnership : " whenever @entity6 and @entity5 have worked and grown together , this has also led to the development and economic prosperity of the world , " he said			1
there are indeed a number of potential synergies			0
and @entity6 has much to learn from @entity5 , as i 've written previously			2
according to the @entity71 's latest @entity70 -- an indicator of how business friendly a country is -- @entity5 places 28th in the world for overall competitiveness ; @entity6 ranks 71st			1
on infrastructure and macroeconomic environment , @entity5 ranks 46th and 10th respectively ; @entity6 tanks 87th and 101st			2
in many of his recent speeches , @entity10 has referred to @entity6 's rotting infrastructure			1
supply chains are broken ; institutions are inefficient ; large swathes of @entity6 are disconnected from modernity			0
@entity6 needs money and expertise to fix these problems			0
that 's where @entity5 could come in			0
one of the expected headlines from @entity4 's visit is an announcement to the effect of $ 100 billion of @entity5 investment into @entity6			1
if that actually happens , the world 's two biggest countries by population could finally begin to realize the potential of their partnership			2
@entity5 may be @entity6 's biggest trading partner , but @entity5 counts @entity103 , the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , and even @entity107 as more important partners right now			1
given the the two countries share a large border , @entity6 will want that status to change			2
for @entity5 , too , there are clear upsides to increasing trade with a neighbor that has growing economic needs and clout			0
regional aspirations beyond the rhetoric of business camaraderie , there are fears the two country 's regional aspirations could represent a hurdle			0
@entity6 media reported on tuesday a minor border skirmish between @entity6 and @entity5 forces in @entity130			1
while border scuffles between the two countries have been largely quelled since @entity6 and @entity5 fought a war in 1962 , both sides have made foreign policy moves that have caused angst			2
in the past week alone , @entity5 's @entity4 visited , for the first time , the @entity137 and @entity138			1
in both countries -- close neighbors of @entity6 's -- @entity4 announced large - scale infrastructure projects and deepened ties			1
many @entity6 analysts see @entity5 's economic encircling of @entity6 as something to be wary of			1
but meanwhile , @entity6 itself has made moves that have irked the @entity5			2
@entity6 's president @entity148 visited @entity149 this week , calling the ties between the two countries historic and " infinite			1
" @entity149 has long had turbulent relations with @entity5			0
and earlier this month , much was made of @entity10 's five - day visit to @entity105			0
both sides announced increased trade and investment , and have held joint military exercises -- a clear signal to @entity5 that it wo n't have a clear route to supremacy in @entity3			0
hedging bets both @entity4 and @entity10 seem to be foreign policy realists , pragmatic in their world view and partnerships			2
in his aforementioned column this week , @entity4 spoke of a world moving towards " multipolarity " -- a reference to the dwindling influence of the @entity104 , and the increasingly important role of @entity5 and @entity6			1
if both leaders abide by that theme , then their focus for the next few months and years will be not on rocking the boat on military or defense , but on building their respective economies			0
for both @entity10 and @entity4 , foreign policy begins at home			0
for that , they will need each others ' cooperation .			0
