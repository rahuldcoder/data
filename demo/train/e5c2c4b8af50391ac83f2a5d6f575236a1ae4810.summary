-- @entity2 's lies last year to authorities in @entity4 -- including adopting an alter ego and claiming she was from @entity6 -- set off a harrowing journey that , according to posts on a @entity10 page featuring photographs of her , she seemed to later regret			1
by friday , the troubled teenager was finally back in the @entity15 , after being arrested and then deported to a country that she 'd never been in before			1
it was a months - long escapade that has her family asking questions about how she got to the @entity21 nation and what happened to her while there			2
@entity2 's journey began april 2 , 2011 , in a @entity26 , @entity4 , shopping mall where the 15 - year - old was arrested for shoplifting a white shirt , black vest and jeans			1
it was a petty crime that turned out to be the first step in her changing her identity			0
@entity26 police , according to documents obtained by @entity0 , show that @entity2 told authorities that her name was 21 - year - old @entity39 and that she was a citizen of @entity6			1
she listed her address as a home just north of downtown @entity26			0
a judge assigned @entity26 attorney @entity43 to represent the woman then known as @entity45 on the misdemeanor theft charge			0
the case was resolved in one day , after she pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served			0
she was then handed over to @entity49 agents			0
deported @entity4 teen arrives back in @entity15 @entity43 said he never saw any signs that his client was a teenage runaway from @entity53 , and not from @entity6 as she indicated			1
" she did n't make any attempts and cry out that i 'm not an illegal immigrant or anything like that , " @entity43 told @entity0			1
" you would remember someone saying that 's not me			0
" the lawyer said , eight months later , he now believes " she knew what she was doing " -- even if he is hard - pressed to explain why			2
whatever her thinking , @entity49 agents say @entity2 continued to play the role of " @entity45 " during the next two months			1
federal immigration officials say they 're " still investigating this matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of this case			0
" the attorney representing the @entity2 family said that the @entity15 government is to blame , not the girl , for her deportation			1
" i do n't buy that she had the wherewithal to be able to bamboozle the government , " @entity78 says			2
" you know , kids are scared when they get around authorities			0
... to think that you could bamboozle them to create a new identity , it just does n't make sense			2
" a @entity15 immigration official -- who was not able to speak for attribution , because the investigation is ongoing -- said that that the girl then known as @entity45 waived her right to an immigration attorney and did not fight deportation proceedings			1
according to @entity15 immigration officials , they 'd never come across anyone by the name @entity45			1
her fingerprints did not match anyone in law enforcement databases , nor was there a match for the name @entity2			1
and the background check " revealed no information to invalidate her claims , " the officials said			0
@entity112 government officials then interviewed @entity2 and issued her the needed travel documents and " full @entity112 citizenship , " according to the @entity15 immigration officials			1
that meant that , six months after running away from her @entity53 home , the 15 - year - old girl was on her way to @entity6 -- for the first time in her life			1
she arrived in @entity122 on may 23 , according to the @entity112 government			0
what exactly happened , once she arrived in the @entity21 nation , is unclear			0
@entity126 has been advising the @entity2 family in the search for @entity2 for almost a year in her capacity as the director of the @entity131 , a non-profit agency that helps families find missing loved ones			1
she and members of @entity2 's family say that various internet postings they discovered show that two @entity112 men befriended the runaway teenager and they spent a lot of time together during her time in @entity26			1
" so you think it 's a coincidence she came up with a @entity112 name and said she was from @entity6 ? " said @entity126			1
" otherwise she is absolutely the smartest , most creative 15 - year - old child i know of			1
i ca n't wrap my brain around the idea that she did this all on her own			0
" after arriving in @entity6 , a @entity10 page and @entity152 feed arose tied to someone using her adopted moniker , @entity45			2
if the postings were indeed written by the runaway teen , they offer a glimpse into the tormented troubles of a lost teenager			2
the writer claims to be from @entity164 , @entity165 , and studied at @entity166 , neither of which are true of @entity2			2
the writings also indicate that their author spent some time working in a telephone call center and as a maid in @entity122			0
but the most dominant theme of the @entity10 posts , which went up between june and november of last year , is that the person identified as @entity45 is " @entity174			0
" the writer also talks about smoking marijuana and being part of tortured and volatile relationships			0
a couple of times , the writer references her life back in the @entity15 including : -- on may 25 : " back home in @entity6 got deported			1
really missed everyone in @entity26 ... " -- on august 12 : " well was in jail , now i 'm free man am still feel like i 'm loke up in this country ... " -- and on june 30 : " i 'm having to many problems in mi life , just found out i ca n't even go bak to the states in another 5 years ... " only once does the writer appear to cryptically allude to the journey that landed her in @entity6			1
that came on a july 28 @entity10 post that reads , " i 'm f * * king tired i just want a f * * king time machine , and rewind all the bull * * it i did wrong man @entity202			0
. i 'm never going to be happy here			0
" the tone is far different in a more recent post from october , one month before @entity112 authorities took @entity2 into custody			2
it includes a series of pictures uploaded under the banner , " familia , me happy 4 once in the mountains			0
" for @entity2 's grandmother , who spent months monitoring these @entity10 postings , this was difficult to read			2
still , she told @entity0 that , despite it all , she is grateful that her granddaughter is alive			0
" i always feared she would be killed , " @entity217 said			0
now , the teenage girl is back home in @entity4 -- alive in a place she has n't been in over a year , near her family .			2

@entity2 told police that she was from @entity6 after being arrested
she created an alter ego and did n't fight her deportation , a @entity15 official says
in fact , she was a 15 - year - old runaway teenager from @entity53
