@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is fine with the enhanced security techniques at @entity6 airports , and he said security agents are welcome to pat him down all they want if it keeps air travel safe			1
" they can pat me down for three hours if it 's going to save someone 's life , " the 63 - year - old @entity10 , @entity11 , resident semi-joked tuesday after flying into @entity13			2
are you flying ? share your airport experiences not that security personnel tested his willingness			2
@entity3 did go through a full - body scan at @entity23 hours earlier but did n't get an enhanced pat - down			1
neither , it seemed , did many people arriving in @entity0 on tuesday			0
from the volume of the public outcry as enhanced measures have been rolled out at more airports this month , you might think @entity6 were getting groped right and left			2
but the @entity32 estimates that less than 3 percent of air travelers will receive enhanced pat - downs , which some travelers have called " groping " or worse			1
less clear is how many are getting full - body scans , another enhanced measure that has drawn complaints of its own			2
but of the fliers to whom @entity2 spoke at @entity0 's airport tuesday , most said they felt like air travel was business as usual			1
of 35 people @entity2 interviewed at the airport 's baggage claim areas in an unscientific survey , 28 went through only metal detectors at the airport they departed			1
five underwent body scans , and two had enhanced pat - downs			1
nearly all had flown into @entity0 on tuesday ; two were picking up passengers but had flown in the past week			2
@entity58 , 51 , said she was subjected to metal detectors when she flew from @entity60 , @entity61 , to @entity0 on saturday			1
but she said she 'd be ok with submitting to advanced - imaging technology and pat - downs			1
" if it 's what you have to do to be safe , then it 's ok			0
either that , or you just do n't fly			0
you can drive if you want to drive , " @entity58 said			0
check the latest airport delays at the nation 's busiest airports the @entity32 has said the ramped - up use of full - body scanning and pat - downs is needed to stop nonmetallic threats , including explosives , from getting aboard planes and are meant to head off attacks such as the one allegedly attempted by @entity80 last @entity81			1
authorities allege he had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from the @entity87 to @entity88			0
about 400 body - scanning machines have been installed at 70 of the country 's nearly 450 commercial airports			1
the @entity32 said there are nearly 2,200 security lines at checkpoints nationwide			1
metal detectors are still the dominant screening technology , although the new scanners have been installed mostly at airports with high passenger volume			1
the @entity32 has not estimated what percentage of passengers are likely to receive body scanning , but the number will jump over the next year			1
by the end of 2011 , the agency plans to deploy another 600 scanning machines , bringing the total to 1,000			0
pat - downs are used primarily on passengers who set off either the body - scanning machine or metal detectors , and are guaranteed for travelers who opt out of body scanning			1
critics of the scanners said they are too invasive -- showing more anatomy to security personnel than some may wish -- and possibly unhealthy , pointing to low doses of radiation used in one of the two technologies used by the machines			0
homeland security secretary @entity123 has said the radiation levels have been thoroughly tested and are " almost immeasurable , [ they 're ] so small , " and the @entity32 said a traveler is exposed to less radiation from one full - body scan than from two minutes of an airline flight			1
critics of the pat - downs said they have become more aggressive and humiliating , coming too close to private areas			1
public opinion polls seem to suggest more @entity6 favor the full - body scans over pat - downs			1
a @entity136 poll released monday showed 64 percent of respondents supported the use of scanners , with 32 percent opposed			0
in the same poll , 48 percent said the new pat - down procedures are justified , while 50 percent said they went too far			2
in a @entity143 / @entity142 of frequent air travelers released tuesday , 57 percent said going through a full - body scan does n't bother them			0
about 24 percent said it bothered them but did n't make them angry , and 18 percent said it made them angry			0
forty - two percent said pat - downs did n't bother them			1
waiting for his baggage at @entity0 's airport tuesday after flying from @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity154 said he did n't go through a pat - down or a body scanner			1
he said he 's ok with body scanners in some cases , but not the hand pats			1
" i think the way they 're patting down people is a little too blunt , " said @entity154 , 31 , of @entity164 , @entity158			0
@entity168 , 73 , said he just went through a metal detector when he prepared to fly to @entity0 from @entity170 , @entity171			2
but he does n't like the idea of body scanning , citing radiation and privacy concerns			2
" they might go in the backroom and start laughing , " the @entity177 , @entity158 - area resident said of his concerns about security agents looking at images of his body			2
" but my main concern is it will give a lot of x-rays to you			0
" @entity189 , a 26 - year - old legislative correspondent for a @entity6 senator , said she received a body scan tuesday at @entity193 's @entity192			2
" i do n't mind them , " she said			0
" if it 's going to protect me from someone hiding something on my airplane , i 'm fine with it			0
" as for people 's concerns that the images are too revealing ? " you ca n't see my face , so i do n't care , " she said			0
@entity3 's wife , @entity205 , did receive a pat - down at @entity23			2
the agent asked her if she wanted the hand pat in a private room ( she declined ) and told her what she would be doing with her hands before she did it			0
" to me , it 's fine			0
just get it over and done with , " the 63 - year - old teacher said			0
her husband , a football coach at @entity217 and a teacher , said the public is fickle			0
" if we get a [ terrorist ] incident tomorrow , then people will [ complain ] that people were n't patted down enough , " he said			0
" if you want security , you 've got to expect inconveniences			0

of 35 passengers interviewed at @entity0 's airport , 28 went through metal detectors
@entity32 has nearly 2,200 security lines at airports nationwide and 400 body scanners
polls show public is more supportive of body scanning than enhanced pat - downs
