@entity0 -- president @entity5 's national security team has recommended the @entity3 suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to @entity7 over the @entity7 military 's ouster of president @entity10 , @entity3 officials said			1
the recommendation , officials said , was made in a " principals meeting " last week of the president 's national security team , including national security adviser @entity15 , secretary of state @entity16 and defense secretary @entity17			0
the meeting was the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to the july 3 ouster of @entity10 , @entity7 's first democratically elected leader			1
the @entity5 administration has not labeled @entity10 's removal from office a " coup			0
" such a designation would require a cut in all but humanitarian aid			0
the @entity30 has said it was in @entity3 national security interests to keep the aid intact , although it did delay delivery of some fighter planes			2
but after @entity3 calls to the @entity7 military for restraint over the last month were met with a heavy - handed crackdown on @entity10 supporters , @entity5 canceled a joint military exercise and announced a new review of @entity3 aid to @entity7			1
@entity7 rethinking who its ' real friends ' are that aid totals $ 1.5 billion a year , $ 1.3 billion of which goes to the @entity7 military			1
the rest is economic assistance , some of which goes to the government and some goes to other groups , although only aid to the government would be suspended and could be reinstated once a democratic government is re-established			0
officials said @entity5 's advisers recommended that the cut in aid include all foreign military financing to the @entity7 military , except funding toward security in the @entity62 and along the @entity7 border with the @entity64			1
the @entity62 has become increasingly unstable over the past year , with @entity3 troops in the area monitoring the peace treaty with @entity7 coming under increased threat			1
the officials said they did n't expect @entity5 to make a decision until after @entity71 votes on his request to authorize military strikes on @entity74 , which is not expected until next week			0
" the president has not made a decision to suspend or terminate our assistance to @entity7 beyond what the administration has already announced , " said @entity75 , spokeswoman for the @entity76			2
" the national security team continues to review all of our assistance to @entity7			2
" intervening in @entity85 turmoil : mission impossible ?			0
