@entity0 -- a business management expert testified monday as lawyers try to prove @entity5 's last concert promoter is liable in the singer 's death			1
human resources consultant @entity9 's analysis of @entity11 's hiring practices may lack the drama of last week 's testimony by @entity5 's oldest son , but it could be crucial for proving that the company negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity16			1
the trial of the lawsuit filed by @entity5 's mother and three children began its tenth week with their lawyers nearing the end of their case			0
@entity11 lawyers are expected to start presenting their defense around july 15			2
@entity11 contends that @entity5 , not its executives , chose and controlled @entity16 , who is serving a prison sentence for an involuntary manslaughter conviction			2
if the jury decides that @entity11 executives have responsibility for @entity5 's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol , they will then have to decide how much he might have earned in the years he did n't get to live			1
nephew : @entity5 was murdered @entity39 and @entity41 dancing jurors would have learned a lot about @entity5 's work and worth if they had traveled with the @entity45 to @entity46 over the weekend for the premiere of @entity49 's " @entity50 " show			1
@entity39 , 16 , and @entity41 , 11 , sang and danced while watching the @entity49 celebration of their father 's music and life in a @entity57 theater			1
@entity58 , 15 , was unable to attend because she is still hospitalized since last month 's suicide attempt			2
the children never saw their father perform live , one of his motivations for attempting his comeback concerts , but thanks to technology @entity5 appeared to be back on stage for a ghostly performance of " @entity70			0
" @entity39 's appearance at the opening of the permanent show , which is different from @entity49 's traveling " @entity75 " show , came three days after he appeared in court to tell jurors about his father 's life and last days			1
his father often cried after talking to @entity11 executives as he prepared for his comeback concerts , his oldest son testified wednesday			2
" after he got off the phone , he would cry , " prince @entity5 testified			0
" he would say ' they 're going to kill me , they 're going to kill me			0
' " his father told him he was talking about @entity11 ceo @entity11 and his ex-manager , dr. @entity87 , @entity39 said			1
negligent hiring ? @entity9 , who has worked as a human resources consultant for businesses for nearly 25 years was paid $ 300 an hour by @entity5 lawyers to review documents and testimony on the wrongful death case			0
after about 100 hours , she said she reached an opinion about if @entity11 's hiring of dr. @entity16 was negligent			1
" they did indeed fail to follow adequate hiring practices , " she testified monday			1
serving as a personal doctor for @entity5 was " a very high risk position " that warranted a background check to determine if @entity16 was fit for the job , competent to do the work and did not have a conflict of interest , @entity9 testified			0
@entity5 lawyers contend that @entity16 's deep debt , which included $ 1 million in foreclosures and judgments , made him conflicted since he could lose his $ 150,000 a month job if @entity5 did n't make to rehearsals and perform his concerts			2
a simple credit check -- taking five minutes and costing less than $ 10 -- would have revealed the conflict of interest , she said			0
credit checks are routine for many companies hiring for high - risk positions , she said			0
a key piece of evidence used by the @entity5 lawyers is an e-mail sent by @entity11 ce @entity11 to " @entity122 " show director @entity123 on june 20 , 2009 -- five days before @entity5 died from an overdose of propofol administered by @entity16			0
" this doctor is extremely successful ( we check everyone out ) and does not need this gig so he is totally unbiased and ethical , " @entity126 wrote in an effort to assure @entity128 was in good hands with dr. @entity16			0
@entity9 testified that she found no evidence the company did anything to check out dr @entity16 for fitness , competence or any conflict of interest that might lead him to provide unsafe treatments			0
@entity11 argues that it never hired @entity16 , but simply negotiated with him on @entity5 's behalf			2
@entity144 said companies have the same obligation in hiring , whether for a regular employee or and independent contractor			0
jury tampering ? jurors can expect to be watched more closely by court bailiffs after an incident near the end of friday 's session			1
two alternate jurors told the judge that a woman approached them during a court break			1
" she mention ' please do n't give anyone any money , ' " alternate juror no. 1 said			1
alternate juror no. 5 quoted the woman , saying " i just wanted to say not to award them any money			2
" while the woman apparently was opposed to the @entity5 's lawsuit seeking billions of dollars in damages , @entity11 lawyer @entity167 used the incident to suggest that the judge should crack down on @entity5 fans who wear @entity5 shirts and carry signs of support for @entity177 in the court hallway			1
@entity180 judge @entity179 rejected @entity167 's request , saying @entity5 fans have free speech rights that she can not limit			0
both alternate jurors said the incident would not affect their ability to make an impartial decision in the case .			0
