-- the latest report of an abusive outburst from petulant @entity4 @entity3 gov. @entity3 is just the most recent in a continuous stream of invective dating back to his 2010 campaign and the beginning of his term in 2011			1
@entity3 's language has been described in various euphemistic ways -- colorful , blunt , direct , plainspoken -- but no matter how it is sugar - coated , @entity3 's language is the offensive frothing of an abusive , tantrum - throwing bully			1
during the campaign in 2010 , @entity3 said president @entity19 could " go to hell			2
" now , a local newspaper reported that @entity3 told a fundraiser audience that @entity19 " hates white people , " and it swept through social and traditional media			2
knowing @entity3 , nobody was surprised or doubted he said it , although he has since denied it			2
@entity3 defends himself against accusations of blatant racism by saying his son is black -- referring to a young @entity31 man who came to live with his family as a teen			2
that also was the excuse for the excuse @entity3 hid behind when he told the @entity37 to " kiss my butt " after he was criticized for not attending his first martin luther king day celebration			0
he vowed not to kowtow to " special interests " -- the @entity37 -- because he is governor of " all the people			0
" @entity3 has consistently attacked any group or position that opposes his own			1
he removed a mural from the @entity46 in the dead of night because he received an anonymous letter from someone claiming the mural made him feel as though he were living in @entity51			0
sadly , a federal judge in @entity53 upheld his theft of the mural as government speech			0
@entity3 hired an out - of - state sign maker to produce and erect a message at the @entity4 border with @entity60 that " @entity4 is open for business			1
" in a stroke of poetic justice , the sign was stolen			0
he has attacked @entity4 @entity65 , infamously and crudely saying that one state legislative leader was the first to stick it to the people of @entity4 without using @entity69			0
he refused to meet with @entity65 leadership after the party reclaimed a majority in the legislature in 2012 because the party hired a videographer to record all of his public appearances			0
an equal opportunity bully , however , @entity3 has also berated his fellow @entity78 when they have dared to work with @entity65 on the state budget			1
local journalists have been a favorite and consistent target of @entity3 's mean - spirited retaliation , as well			1
he has said he wanted to punch a veteran reporter for @entity84 and has stormed out of at least one news conference and a legislative session			0
when journalists questioned his wife 's residency in @entity89 , thus qualifying their daughter , whom @entity3 hired fresh out of college for his staff despite rumblings of nepotism , for in - state tuition at @entity96 , he threw a fit and rampaged out of the interview			1
complaining of biased news reporting , @entity3 has refused to be interviewed by the @entity100			0
at the national level , @entity3 has been the butt of the " @entity103 " and " @entity104 " jokes			1
he is an embarrassment to the people of @entity4 and has made the state a laughingstock			0
the list of his offensive and cringe - worthy remarks goes on : calling state workers " corrupt , " comparing the @entity116 to the @entity117 , saying the worst case of the use of a controversial chemical additive will be that it might give women " little beards			0
" however painful it is to see how much @entity3 has ruined the public 's opinion of @entity4 , i am resigned to the probability that his pattern of bullying and blustering followed by defensive claims of populism is likely to end only when he leaves office			1
a plea for political civility similar to the one that followed the assassination attempt against former @entity137 rep. @entity136 may be the only response to @entity3 that has a chance , although he only insults fellow @entity4 republicans who try to cajole him into civility			1
his abusive bullying is comparable to former @entity146 gov. @entity145 's literal use of gun sights on a graphic to mark the @entity65 she wanted targeted			2
and if there was any politician who matched @entity3 for abusive language and combativeness , it 's the late @entity155 gov. @entity154			1
the best news i 've heard about @entity3 of late is that he might run for @entity157 rather than a second term as governor			0
running at the mouth in the media spotlight of the nation 's capital could spell the political doom he deserves , and leave @entity4 in peace to rebuild its tarnished image as a state with a tradition of independent yet high - minded and civil - tongued politicians .			2

@entity171 : @entity4 gov. @entity3 's language is offensive frothing of an abusive bully
@entity171 : @entity3 attacks with invective any group that stands in his way , even his own party
@entity171 : he throws tantrums , storms out , refuses to meet leaders , insults reporters
