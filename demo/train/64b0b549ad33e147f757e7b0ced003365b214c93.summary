so this standout refuels you and keeps you satisfied so you do n't overnosh the rest of the day			0
" with most other breakfasts , you would need to add another food to get this much protein , " @entity22 explains			2
" @entity60 , the fiber content is much higher than you 'd usually find in such a high - protein meal			1
" calories 334 ; fat 21g ( sat 8g ) ; protein 24g ; carbohydrate 21g ; fiber 11g ; sodium 516mg room for improvement : the fat content is on the high side ( since the wrap is made with eggs ) , so eat low - fat fare throughout the day -- or split this hearty pick with a friend			1

@entity151 @entity150 ( @entity152 ) it 's no surprise that two oatmeals made our list			0
oatmeal is a favorite among dietitians because it contains two kinds of fiber : the insoluble kind , which helps prevent constipation , and the soluble type , which digests slowly to help regulate blood sugar			2
" oatmeal is more filling than many other cereals , " @entity22 explains			0
@entity152 's oatmeal edged past the @entity11 's version ( # 6 ) because it has less saturated fat and sodium , plus more protein and fiber			1
still , you ca n't go wrong with either			0
calories 280 ; fat 4g ( sat 1g ) ; protein 8g ; carbohydrate 56g ; fiber 7g ; sodium 10mg room for improvement : the protein content is a bit low : make it more filling by eating a few nuts or a yogurt on the side			1
scrambled @entity187 , @entity188 , and @entity189 ( @entity190 's ) yes , you can have eggs and sausage ! but pass over the @entity190 menu and look for these better - for - you breakfast " sides " to design your own morning meal			2
" this is a really well - rounded breakfast , " @entity85 says			2
it 's not too high in sodium , either ; a surprise for a sausage breakfast , she says			0
calories 230 ; fat 9g ( sat 0g ) ; protein 19g ; carbohydrate 19g ; fiber 3g ; sodium 447mg room for improvement : order a piece of whole - grain toast ( without butter or margarine ) to increase the fiber factor , adding about 100 more calories			1
@entity0 : 7 breakfasts under 300 calories 6			0
@entity189 ( @entity11 's ) the judges praised @entity11 's for adding this good - for - you pick with fresh fruit to its menu ( breakfast antioxidants at the drive - through -- nice )			2
this tasty treat includes diced green and red apples , dried cranberries , raisins , a touch of cream , and brown sugar			0
plus oatmeal 's soluble fiber helps lower cholesterol and control blood sugar , helping to fight off diabetes , @entity85 says			2
calories 260 ; fat 4.5g ( sat 1.5g ) ; protein 7g ; carbohydrate 48g ; fiber 5g ; sodium 115mg ( for oatmeal without brown sugar ) room for improvement : watching calories ? order it without the brown sugar to save 30 calories			1
" you wo n't miss it with all the fruity flavors , " @entity85 explains			0
simple & @entity250 ( @entity12 ) a veggie omelette is a great way to sneak more nutrient - and fiber - rich produce into your power breakfast , @entity116 says			1
in this case you get a flavor-fest of green peppers , mushrooms , onions , and oven - roasted tomatoes			2
" and the side of fruit adds a nice ( sweet ) touch , " she says			0
calories 320 ; fat 10g ( sat 1g ) ; protein 21g ; carbohydrate 40g ; fiber 8g ; sodium 420mg room for improvement : this omelette is made with " egg substitute " ( which contains mostly egg whites ) ; if you prefer the real thing , ask your server to substitute egg whites instead			1

@entity281 ( @entity282 ) for just 160 calories , this melt with egg whites , @entity283 , green peppers , @entity75 and @entity286 cheeses , and red onion stacked on an @entity292 muffin lets you eat light without feeling even a little bit deprived			1
do n't like peppers or onions ? order your melt with fresh tomatoes and spinach instead			0
if you want something more substantial , round out your meal with @entity282 's packaged apple slices or yogurt			0
calories 160 ; fat 4g ( sat 1.5g ) ; protein 15g ; carbohydrate 19g ; fiber 5g ; sodium 680mg room for improvement : this pick did n't show up higher on our list because the sodium count is high			1
@entity313 ( @entity314 ) no need to deprive yourself if you 're watching calories and fat : the reduced - fat cheddar cheese , egg whites , spinach , and turkey sausage in this winner from @entity314 make this a healthy indulgence			1
calories 150 ; fat 5g ( sat 2.5g ) ; protein 11g ; carbohydrate 14g ; fiber 1g ; sodium 400mg room for improvement : this pick tastes rich , but it 's small , so it may not keep you full for as long as the egg options higher on our list , @entity85 explains			1
it 's also low in filling fiber , so pair it with a piece of fruit for more fuel			0

@entity341 ( @entity15 ) this egg , @entity344 white cheddar , and smoked lean ham sandwich serves up as much protein as a 3.5 - ounce fish fillet , @entity22 says			1
also praiseworthy , she adds , is @entity15 's whole - grain bread			1
made of rye , spelt , amaranth , and flax , it 's brimming with good - for - you nutrients like vitamin @entity355 , niacin , manganese , iron , magnesium , and selenium			0
calories 330 ; fat 14g ( sat 6g ) ; protein 22g ; carbohydrate 31g ; fiber 4g ; sodium 830mg			1
