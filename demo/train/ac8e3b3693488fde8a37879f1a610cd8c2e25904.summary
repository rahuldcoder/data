the purse was by designer @entity1 , and it was only $ 5			1
but when @entity2 bought it at the thrift store where she works , she immediately had to run over to the bank and deposit money to avoid running a negative balance			1
she and her husband only recently caught up on their rent , after four or five months , and @entity2 has close to 100 purses already , but she still went for the bargain			1
in thinking about this and other splurges on things she did n't need , @entity2 has begun to consider herself a compulsive shopper			1
" i am ashamed of it , " says @entity2 , 22 , of @entity18 , @entity19			1
" i 've screwed up a lot			1
i know i should stop			2
" with holiday season discounts running rampant online and in stores , it 's especially easy to fall into the trap of overspending this month , especially if you have a problem with impulse control at the mall			2
but beyond carelessness with finances , compulsive shopping is a mental disorder that psychologists recognize , although it has not been studied extensively			1
for compulsive shoppers , buying something creates a feeling related to the euphoria that alcohol induces , said @entity40 , a psychologist in @entity41			1
as with alcoholics , it 's hard to keep away from that rush of pleasure			2
about 6 % of women and 5.5 % of men are compulsive buyers , according to a 2006 study from @entity50 in the @entity51			1
the mental disorder has not been studied extensively , but it is thought to be an impulse control disorder			2
april @entity54 , @entity55 psychologist and author of " to buy or not to buy : why we overshop and how to stop , " estimates that between one third and one half of compulsive buyers eventually turn into hoarders , but some just buy a lot of items and get rid of the old ones			1
where does compulsive shopping come from ? sometimes , people acquire objects as a way of dealing with chaos and feeling out of control , @entity54 said			1
" you buy something , you 're in control of it , " she said			2
it may also be related to childhood			2
parents may have given presents instead of time and attention , leading a child to grow up wanting to get more material possessions			2
other people may have grown up with a lot of emotional or financial deprivation , and when they 're able to afford shopping for themselves , they overbuy as a way of not going back to the way things were			1
another theory is that " we buy as a way of trying to deal with our fears of death and the inevitability of death , " @entity54 said			2
compulsive shopping sometimes goes hand in hand with alcoholism and eating disorders , @entity98 said			1
it 's not currently a separate diagnosis in the @entity106 , the " @entity109 " by which mental health professionals identify conditions			2
psychologists usually view it as an issue of impulse control rather than a sign of obsessive - compulsive disorder ; @entity117 medications do not tend to work for shopping problems , @entity98 said			1
there 's no hard line between treating yourself to a pair of shoes on a bad day and being a compulsive shopper -- it is a spectrum			1
when shopping causes distress in your relationship or if shopping is the only way you can deal with negative feelings , it can be a real problem , @entity98 says			1
@entity135 shoppers might have continued arguments with their spouses over money and ca n't afford basic necessities , she said			1
@entity2 can relate to this			2
" when i 'm upset , it happens more often			2
i get into an argument with my husband or my day is not going right , i definitely spend more , " @entity2 said			2
when her husband asks her what happened to the other $ 400 that was supposed to be in their bank account , she honestly does n't know -- she does n't remember what she spent it all on			0
and she says her husband has threatened to end the marriage if her spending puts them behind in the bills again			0
shopping addicts are especially vulnerable right now because retailers play up the hysteria of limited chances at bargain prices			1
someone with feelings of low self - esteem might equate having a good holiday with buying things			0
especially given the slumping economy of the past few years , consumers are made to feel that , with regard to making certain purchases , it 's now or never			0
" think of a car 's brakes			0
if you do n't have brake fluid you ca n't stop , " @entity98 says			0
" with the impulse to gamble , drink , shop , you ca n't put the brakes on			0
" @entity2 remembers her buying habits started small , with snacks			0
then she moved on to five and below , which she thought would be cheap , but ended up spending $ 140 at once there			0
two months ago , she bought $ 80 worth of beads to make jewelry ; the beads are still in a box			0
" i always end up finding a way to pay the bills , " she said			0
" then , i 'll fall into old patterns			0
" @entity2 learned about the phenomenon through the movie " @entity194 , " but she only stopped to think about herself that way a couple months ago			0
she has joined an online support group , but the meetings happen while she 's at work , and she does n't have enough money for a therapist			1
she has n't found any meetings in her area , either			0
she wrote about her problem on the blog @entity205			0
one strategy that helps some compulsive shoppers curb their habits is to pay in cash , so they see how much they 're spending , @entity98 said			1
they also can try going shopping with other people who can act as a check , making sure they do n't overspend			1
@entity214 , they might want to avoid storing credit card information , so that it 's harder to make a purchase before thinking about it			0
@entity98 recommends waiting 24 hours before actually buying something you do n't really need , to give yourself time to reconsider			0
another source of help might be an online support group , such as @entity225			0
@entity54 has a whole program planned out for compulsive shoppers			1
it begins with examining why they impulsively overshop and what are triggers and consequences of that behavior			0
she helps her clients examine the costs and benefits of spending in this way , " i have them really think through the vision of what they want to be true in their lives , so that they can project ahead and see whether the way they 're living their lives now is likely to get them to where they want to be , " @entity54 said			0
motivation to change comes from recognizing the disconnect between who they want to be and who they are right now , @entity54 said			0
she then takes them through the nitty - gritty of finances : how much did they spend and how much did they want to spend ? how much could they have saved by not buying so much ? this is a nine - week process			0
clients also create a " shopping self - portrait , " in which they envision themselves buying something they later regretted purchasing			1
what needs are they fulfilling by shopping ? love and affection , belonging , self - esteem , the esteem of others , and autonomy are all needs that the client may wish to consider fulfilling in different ways , instead of going to the mall			1
" the underlying rubric of the whole thing is to really get in touch with what it is you really need , and how to get that , " @entity54 said			0
" it 's not that sixth pair of black boots			0
