in @entity7 , @entity8 , packed up their trucks to chase the news of @entity12 's choice for vice president , @entity2 @entity1 were left reflecting on six days of unprecedented national attention			1
after the shooting of six people in a @entity2 gurdwara , a stream of national leaders , from the rev. @entity20 to gov. @entity21 , came to offer condolences and support			1
but there was one person missing			2
it was you , mr. president			2
let me be clear : your administration 's response to the massacre has been strong and swift			2
attorney general @entity33 addressed mourners with compassion and resolve at the friday memorial			2
: " in the recent past , too many sikhs have been targeted and victimized simply because of who they are , how they look , and what they believe , " he said			2
. " this is wrong			2
and it will not be tolerated			2
" @entity44 from the @entity45 expressed his full commitment to helping us with sustained interfaith and education outreach			0
the @entity50 and @entity51 were at the top of their game , investigating the attacks as both an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime			0
but we need more than government cooperation			0
our community needs the deeper spiritual and emotional assurance that we are welcome to live , work and worship as fellow @entity1			0
the gunman , @entity63 , was a member of a white supremacist group that wishes to destroy our very claim to call this country home			0
after the attack we endured , @entity1 , and all brown and black people in @entity71 for that matter , need our president to directly show the nation that we belong here			1
watch : volunteers help temple mourners cope president @entity78 , you flew to @entity79 , @entity80 , to mourn publicly with the families before the dead were buried			1
you hugged your daughters closer that night , imagining them in that theater			0
in response to the massacre of @entity2 in @entity7 , you and @entity12 issued statements of support , but did not suspend campaigning in @entity8 , as you did in @entity80			1
of the major networks , only @entity0 sent an anchor to report live from @entity7 , and none of the networks covered the murders as extensively as they did in @entity80			1
we worry that because the victims were brown - skinned people with " foreign " names , the tragedy has n't elicited the same attention from public officials and the media			0
i believe you can help the nation feel our pain			0
you can show this tragedy is an @entity71 tragedy , because none of us should have to fear gunfire in their own churches , synagogues and mosques			1
if @entity112 could have been your son , and the kids in the @entity79 theater your daughters , then the aunts and uncles shot while praying on that sunday could have also been your own			1
we wish you were there on thursday morning when community members entered their gurdwara for the first time since the massacre			0
you would have witnessed the spirit of chardi kala in the @entity2 faith -- even in darkness , a rising resilience -- and shared this spirit , which is also part of the @entity71 character			1
@entity2 women and men walked into a crime scene : blood on the carpets , there were bullet holes in the walls , and shattered windows			1
they flew into action , ripping out carpets , painting over bullet holes , scrubbing floors , and within hours , they served the first langar ( open meal ) , breaking bread beneath portraits of those who have died for our faith			0
opinion : why @entity71 sikhs will survive we wish you were there later that night for the town hall meeting organized by your @entity51			1
nearly every @entity2 @entity71 told officials that the attack on sunday was not isolated or " senseless , " but one in a long pattern of intentional acts of hate and discrimination in the last decade and long before			1
our children are bullied in schools , our men and women are profiled at airports and barred from military service unless they give up their turbans , and our people endure racial slurs and hate crimes that are not specifically tracked by the @entity50			0
you would have heard the community 's cry for help and publicly called upon all @entity1 to recommit to curbing the alarming rise of hate and fear in this country			0
news : @entity33 calls @entity2 temple shooting a hate crime we wish you were there on friday morning for the memorial for the dead			1
three thousand people filled the @entity188 gymnasium , a sea of people sitting in reverence and sorrow before six open caskets			0
we are deeply moved that you ordered the flags lowered to half - mast , an expression of respect and honor			0
but for @entity2 , and for muslims who watched eight mosques attacked in eleven days , the threat is not over			1
" all politics aside , a personal visit , even with the victims ' families , the temple , the people , for [ the president ] to take pictures with people who have turbans and beards does so much for our safety , " said @entity203 , whose father was killed bravely fighting the gunman			0
i returned to @entity219 this week			0
one cab driver pointed to his brown skin and said to me : " this is not just about @entity2 people			2
this is an attack on me too			0
" belief : @entity2 ireports speak to long - held fears in their community president @entity78 , i believe you can help our nation find lasting lessons in @entity7			1
now that we 've had time to grieve , people who care are turning to one another and asking : what do we do now ? " it is that fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper , [ and ] i am my sister 's keeper , that makes this country work , " attorney general @entity33 said , repeating your words at the memorial service			0
president @entity78 , i believe that your wisdom , compassion , and voice can help @entity2 and all @entity1 chart the way forward			1
you may find the starting point when you visit the @entity2 gurdwara in @entity7 -- a single bullet hole remains and below it a sign : " @entity254			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			2

@entity257 : politicians , others came to @entity7 after @entity2 shooting , not @entity78
she *invites* @entity78 , says his presence will send *message* of support , affirmation
@entity257 : shootings in @entity79 drew @entity78 ; not coming to @entity8 hurts sikhs
@entity257 : @entity2 ' values reflect @entity71 values too ; @entity78 must help demonstrate this
