-- @entity3 's @entity2 platform has been growing steadily since its release in 2008			1
now , one out of every three @entity6 smartphone owners is using an @entity2 - based device , according to a recent report			1
so why are n't developers more excited about the platform ? of the 69.5 million @entity6 who owned smartphones as of the end of february , 33 percent used @entity2 devices , according to a report from @entity15			1
it 's a leap of 7 points in a period of only three months			0
the growth of @entity21 's @entity20 remained stagnant , seeing only a 0.2 percent increase over the same period of time			0
competitors @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 were the ones who suffered as @entity2 grew , with drops of 1.3 percent , 1.1 percent and 4.6 percent , respectively			0
the five companies ' smartphone market share is shown in the table below			0
the growth is partly a numbers game			0
one of @entity3 's advantages is the sheer number of phone models running @entity2			1
hardware makers have announced more than 10 different @entity2 devices in the first three months of this year , far more than those running @entity3 's competitors			1
by contrast , @entity25 announced two new phones in february ( the first mobile phone hardware release from the company in far too long ) , only one @entity47 device has appeared in 2011 , and we 're probably not going to see the @entity49 5 anytime soon			0
for all of @entity2 's success , however , the platform has yet to fully satisfy its application developer base			1
@entity53 shared the results of a recent developer survey with @entity56 , showing that more than 50 percent of developers questioned " view fragmentation " -- the disparity in software versions across device manufacturers and handsets -- to be a " meaningful or serious " problem			2
developers also expressed concern over the fragmentation of the app ecosystem on @entity2 , saying they generally preferred a " unified , single - store experience like @entity21 's app store			1
" for customers who enjoy @entity2 's openness , the lack of a single app store is hardly a problem			1
those who wish to go outside the walled garden of @entity21 's @entity20 ( but do n't necessarily want to jailbreak their phones ) can do so fairly easily on an @entity2 device -- or they can use alternative app stores , like @entity82 's			2
but for developers who wants their programs to make serious money , a nonunified app ecosystem may be less than desirable			0
fully 74 percent of respondents said developing for @entity21 's @entity20 gave the best opportunities for paid - app revenues , and twice as many developers claimed their apps were more visible in @entity21 's app store than they were in the @entity92			2
we may see a shift in developer attitudes as @entity2 continues to mature and further improve its app ecosystem			1
@entity3 launched the @entity92 web store in february , and just last week it officially enabled in - app billing , allowing developers to charge customers for items purchased within an application			2
in addition , a several developers have made six - figure revenues from @entity2 apps , with a couple scoring million - dollar paydays			2
with the promise of big money , and a huge base of customers to target , developers have a strong incentive to continue coding for @entity2			0
indeed , despite the complaints , 71 percent of respondents said that they have developed apps for the platform			0
whether they 're currently satisfied with @entity3 's os or not , it looks like developers will continue writing code for it			1

@entity2 keeps growing , with one out of three @entity6 smartphone owners using it
some developers say they do n't like the fragmented nature of @entity2 's store , software
developer attitudes could improve as @entity3 's system continues to mature
