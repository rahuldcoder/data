-- " my body belongs to me and is not the source of anyone 's honor			2
" the words of @entity8 activist @entity7 , scrawled across her naked chest in @entity10 and posted on @entity12 's facebook page are true , and right			1
women should have the choice to dress how they want , when they want , without fear of reprisal and safe from harm			2
as too many women in all corners of the can attest , this is not the reality			2
from war to politics to art , shock tactics can be useful , powerful tools			0
they force the opposed to take notice , to hopefully retreat , to surrender their advantage			0
in the arena of human and women 's rights , they are a staple -- from the burning of draft cards during the anti-vietnam war protests of the 1960s to bra burning ( myth or no ) to @entity42 , the street vendor who set himself on fire and inadvertently roused the @entity46 -- shock tactics can , and do work			1
they work across cultures too : i first learned of the @entity52 which took place in eastern @entity55 in 1929 ( an anti-taxation and anti-colonialist protest which ended with reports of up to 100 @entity59 casualties ) , when i was at school in @entity61			2
i learned that some of these women stripped naked to make their case -- an admirably thought out and executed case of naked protest , in a @entity67 culture , from more than 80 years ago			1
it was effective , too -- administrative reforms were carried out , bringing an end to the warrant chief system ( introduced by @entity73 colonialists ) and women were appointed in local courts			2
so my issue with @entity12 , and any other such organizations , is less to do with the mode of protest , and more the gaze and rhetoric behind it			1
@entity12 purports to know , in an almost patriarchal way , what is " best " for these poor , oppressed women in @entity85 and the @entity86			1
their problem is religion , and their naked protest is there to " help " free them from the " tyranny " therein			1
yes -- there are huge chasms between the rights of men and women all over the world , and perhaps more visibly in these communities			2
but there are also women ( and men ) in those communities working to remedy this , using different tools , ( some more blunt than others ) and in all likelihood just as effective or even i would argue , more so , than @entity12 's methods			1

i know that my experiences do not match that of a woman my age in a small town in @entity121 , or @entity122			0
i do n't wear a hijab ; never have done , unlikely ever to			0
i do n't care one way or another about the hijab , but i do care about choice			0
in electing not to wear a headscarf , i have exercised that right , and not all of the women who wear scarves have the luxury of that choice			0
but there are also millions of women who choose , very happily and deliberately , to wear the hijab			0
is it " liberating " to ban the hijab for these women ? @entity12 's intent may be honorable , but the implementation seems wrong - headed to me			1
a lot of us in brown and black bodies have become used to the neo-colonial lens through which the rest of the world views us			0
we are there to be " helped " , to be " liberated "			0
there exists a powerful and deliberate narrative around @entity85 and the @entity86 : " we must go there and free them ! " if you are only viewing people as hapless , helpless children -- which is how i see a lot of @entity12 's rhetoric as applied to @entity85 and the @entity86 -- you rob them of agency			1
it is not up to @entity12 to go and " free " these women			1
we can not export tactics that simply do n't work , in the name of sisterhood			0
read more : topless feminist protesters show what they 're made of what kind of sisterhood insists that an attitude of " this works here and will therefore work over there " is the way forward ? is there no nuance to be found , if the objective is to free women of the patriarchy that governs their lives ? it is naive and somewhat foolish at best , and at worst dangerous and stupid			1
it is looking at a health problem and deciding that their prescription is the only drug that will clear up the rash , when locally sourced medicines may work just as well , if not better			0
at the very least , work with organizations already at the coalface day after day , collaborate with and listen to them			0
if the aim is genuinely to make a fairer society , not to merely impose benevolent condescension , it 's a necessary step			0
the @entity12 message , with a core belief in self - determination and equality , unshackled from damaging patriarchy , is good and true			1
but their methods leave much to be desired			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of @entity199 .			1

femen activists have used topless protest in a campaign against patriarchy
*journalist* @entity199 says the group 's message of equality is good and true
but she says treating women as " helpless " and " hapless " robs them of agency
it is not up to @entity12 to " free " the women of the @entity86 and @entity85 , @entity199 says
