-- we 've been at the same point many times before			0
the industry has repeatedly promised a " mobile advertising tipping point , " yet despite the proliferation in smartphones , new advertising formats and new promises , mobile advertising is yet to come of age			2
but as the mobile industry meets in @entity13 this week , there are many reasons to feel optimistic about mobile 's benefit to advertisers			1
there are still some hurdles to overcome and lessons to learn , but it is our belief that mobile advertising will have a long and healthy life in the future			2

true , we live in an era where disruption is the norm			0
we expect new businesses to emerge - often seemingly overnight - to usurp standard practice			2
but should we fear it ? i think not			0
if we focus on mobile phones - then it is our expectation that mobile media will take no more than 20 % of digital revenues by 2016			1
yet if we include tablets within mobile media , we can predict that mobile advertising will surpass traditional digital spending by 2016			1

seen through an advertisers ' eyes , mobile is so much more complex than other media formats			1
mobile screen sizes are , on average , 10 times smaller than pc screens			0
mobile advertisers are working with real estate that the advertiser has to carefully plan			1
additionally , the personal nature of the device means consumers do not like to be interrupted unnecessarily by untimely messages			0
finally , the plethora of device and operating system choices , make it supremely challenging for brands and advertisers to understand how , when and with what to target their audiences			0

@entity84 's annual independent study into mobile media habits for advertisers , showed that in the @entity88 82 % of mobile media users access the internet primarily via the browser , compared to 61 % who accessed internet information from an app. with growing @entity96 penetration , we expect web apps usage to continue to grow beyond where we are today			1
this will allow a much more consistent and richer offering around advertising on mobile			0
so mobile will certainly challenge digital			1
it may erode digital budgets			1
but it should not kill it			0
to think that mobile could kill off another media format would completely miss the benefit of mobile devices			1

we see three principle reasons as to why mobile has tremendous potential : it is often the last touch - point before a purchase			2
secondly it is the " connective tissue " linking and integrating other media formats			0
finally , mobile is more personal , more social and more local than any other media			0
and in real terms we believe we 're still two or three years away from mobile truly coming of age			0
but it is a tremendously exciting time , where we will see experimentation and new forms of engagement emerge , based on mobile habits			0
so back to the question , will mobile kill digital advertising ? i do n't think so			1
but perhaps mobile advertising 's biggest threat at the moment is itself			2
unless the industry works together , addresses complexity and properly understands mobile behaviours , we risk being held at a standstill and never reaching the promised tipping point .			0
