-- the @entity2 bombings were horrific and senseless crimes			0
thus far , all the publicly released evidence suggests that the crimes were the work of just two individuals , the @entity8 brothers			1
the elder brother , @entity9 , is dead , and the younger brother , @entity10 , is in serious condition at a @entity13 hospital			0
assuming that he recovers and is mentally fit , @entity8 must face trial			1
the question is where : in state court or federal court ? both are legitimate possibilities			1
as with the @entity24 bombing in 1995 , the acts of which he is accused constitute a variety of crimes under both state and federal law			1
there have been numerous calls to prosecute @entity8 in federal court because federal law offers the possibility of the death penalty , but @entity36 law does not			1
this would be a very poor basis upon which to make the choice			1
the decision of where to prosecute should be based on which jurisdiction has a greater interest in the case , not where the potential for vengeance is greater			1
in the @entity24 bombing , the federal prosecution was given priority because @entity50 was motivated by hatred of the federal government to directly attack it , destroying a federal building and killing scores of federal employees and their children in the process			1
did one brother brainwash the other ? there does not appear to be a similar federal interest here			0
the @entity2 is the quintessential @entity13 event , and the victims were predominantly @entity36 residents			2
those killed by the blast were a local restaurant manager , a schoolchild and an international student attending @entity70			0
the law enforcement officer victims were an @entity73 transit police officer and an @entity75 campus police officer			0
the crimes , in addition to the bombings , included an attempted convenience store robbery and a carjacking , crimes typically prosecuted in state court			2
the elected representatives of @entity36 have rejected numerous attempts to reinstate the death penalty since it was invalidated by the state 's @entity86 in 1984			1
gov. @entity88 and other state authorities should resist allowing the passion and grief of the moment to override the will of the people of @entity36 not to execute its citizens by turning the case over to the feds			1
comments by mayor @entity99 expressing a hope that the @entity103 attorney will " throw the book " at @entity8 , although understandable after what his city has been through , do not represent the sober reflection we expect of our leaders			2
of course , we do not yet know what motivated the bombers			0
if investigation reveals that the attack was an attempt to terrorize the @entity103 as a whole as part of some jihadist ideology , then the federal interest in prosecution would be stronger			0
but at the moment , the @entity36 has a much stronger claim to prosecute			2
opinion : nine questions about the bombers one option that clearly should not be on the table is any effort to treat @entity8 as an enemy combatant			1
he is an @entity103 citizen			0
just like @entity50 , he is entitled to all the rights and privileges afforded citizens under the @entity130 and does not forfeit them because he appears to have committed heinous crimes			0
we must resist the tendency to treat every act of violence as an act of war just because we are in a " war on terror " and to reflexively label every criminal of foreign origin or @entity143 faith as a terrorist			0
and if and when @entity8 is well enough to be questioned , the interrogation should start with a @entity147 warning			2
now that the crisis has passed , there is no urgent need to invoke the @entity151 v. @entity152 " public safety exception " as a means of circumventing this young man 's constitutional rights			0
@entity13 is the cradle of @entity103 liberty and is justifiably famous for its rejection of oppressive and tyrannical government			0
let us not sully that reputation by sacrificing @entity8 's civil liberties in the heat of the moment			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2

many say bombing *suspect* 's trial should be in federal court *due* to death penalty
former prosecutor @entity167 says that 's a poor basis for a decision on where to try him
he says the case seems more *focused* on state matters , belongs in @entity36 court
@entity167 : do **n't** treat @entity8 as " enemy combatant " ; do **n't** deny him civil liberties
