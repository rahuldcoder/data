idiotic tv shows and all the latest apps bumming you out on the 21st century ? ready for some " me time " on the world 's remotest islands ? forget golden sands and swaying palms -- the reality of solitude is different as these terrifyingly distant landfalls demonstrate			1
@entity11 , 750 miles from @entity12 the @entity14 island group of @entity15 stands profoundly alone in the @entity16			1
the nearest landfall is @entity12 , 1,750 miles east , and to the west , @entity18 is more than 2,000 miles			1
it 's the world 's most remote inhabited island chain -- so precariously occupied that when a volcanic vent erupted in 1961 , the whole population was evacuated to @entity24			1
reaching @entity15 : this is no easygoing excursion			1
to quote the official website , " there are no package tours for independent travelers , no hotels , no airport , no holiday reps , no night clubs , no restaurants , no jet skis nor safe sea swimming			2
" all visitors need to clear their arrivals in advance through the @entity40 , and they also need to obtain a police certificate			2
( a 40 - day wait is typical			2
) there are around 10 sailings a year from @entity45 , @entity12 , and @entity46 , each taking five to six days to reach the islands ; it costs $ 800 - $ 1,500 for a round trip			1
a list of available ships can be found on the official website : @entity53			2
bear @entity54 miles off @entity56 's north coast @entity57 , better known as @entity57 , is the southernmost island in the @entity60 archipelago of @entity61 , 400 miles north of mainland @entity56 -- but only on paper , given that it 's almost 150 miles south of the @entity65 island chain with which it 's lumped			1
it 's been a nature reserve since 2002 and has a lively history of failed occupation -- hard to believe for a place of barren cliffs , near - zero precipitation and risk of leaks of radioactive material from the nearby wreck of a nuclear submarine			0
reaching @entity57 : getting to the heart of @entity61 is a relatively simple matter -- there are daily flights from @entity83 and @entity84 to @entity61 's capital , @entity86 , on the west coast of @entity88			1
research vessels infrequently call on @entity57 ( the @entity91 makes an occasional appearance ) , while individually chartered boats and the occasional adventure cruise ( such as this one from @entity96 ) haul in the remaining visitors			1
@entity98 , 000 miles from @entity99 @entity15 is the remotest inhabited island in the world -- now , welcome to its uninhabited , far bleaker counterpart			1
it 's almost entirely covered by a glacier			0
in winter , its seas are pack ice			0
and its nearest neighbor is @entity99 , 1,000 miles to the south			1
reaching @entity111 : the entire island is a nature reserve -- so unless you can make a compelling case for visiting , you 'll be blocked by @entity65 authorities			1
get permission , and it 's now a simple matter of finding a research vessel , quickly mastering a valuable skill such as arctic geological surveying or marine biology and then getting someone to land you via helicopter			0
( there are no ports or harbors			0
) if all else fails , try becoming an amateur radio enthusiast : in 1990 , a multinational expedition of operators spent 16 days on the island			1
@entity133 miles from @entity24 regarded by @entity135 as the world 's smallest island with a building on it , @entity134 stands at the end of @entity14 's @entity141 , where coastal waters give way to the fury of the @entity16			1
in 1847 , engineers started building an iron lighthouse there -- and it washed away in a storm			0
its extraordinary successor , first lit in 1858 , stands to this day			0
reaching @entity134 : visiting the most southwesterly point in @entity14 is surprisingly easy -- the @entity153 runs day trips			0
but as @entity156 notes , even on a " calm " day you 're in for serious chop			0
boreray60 miles off mainland @entity158 love the @entity158 islands , but want something with a little more bite ? head west of the @entity163 , and you 'll find the archipelago of @entity166 , 40 miles into the @entity16			1
it 's one of @entity158 's five @entity168 , with a main island that was abandoned in the 1930s when crops failed			1
imagine the surprise of archaeologists when they found that one of the least hospitable islands , @entity176 , was occupied in prehistoric times			2
reaching @entity176 : since @entity176 comes under the protection of the @entity180 , you need its permission to visit			0
then ? lots of time and lots of luck -- with a rugged shoreline and savage sea swell , this is n't an island built for landings			2
according to one guide , more people have reached the summit of @entity194 than have landed at @entity176 since the @entity180 took ownership in 1957			0
@entity196 400 miles from @entity197 @entity196 is one of the 572 islands making up the @entity201 chain in the @entity203 's @entity202			1
it 's surrounded by dangerous reefs , but @entity196 is intimidating because of its inhabitants			0
the @entity207 want nothing to do with the modern world and have repeatedly rebuffed attempts to make peaceful contact			0
reaching @entity196 : you 're kidding , right ? if the above description did n't put you off , this article about a pair of fishermen who strayed onto the island certainly should			2
rockall270 miles from @entity219 if you think @entity176 sounds forbidding , try sailing 187 miles west of it			2
@entity222 is the tip of an extinct volcano reaching 20 meters ( about 65 feet ) above sea level , in seas with waves recorded as high as 29 meters ( 95 feet )			0
in 1955 , the @entity230 , in its final territorial acquisition , seized @entity222 -- allegedly due to fears the @entity231 would build a missile battery on it			0
reaching @entity222 : in the words of the recently minted @entity235 , " visiting @entity222 is difficult , completely weather dependent and not cheap			0
" your best bet is contacting @entity238 and arranging a tailor - made excursion			0
or you could sail there , lash yourself to the rock and claim it as your very own micronation -- but you would n't be the first .			0

forget swaying palms ; these islands offer real solitude
the islands of @entity15 sit 1,750 miles off @entity12
