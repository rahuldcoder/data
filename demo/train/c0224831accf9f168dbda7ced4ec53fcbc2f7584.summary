because he loves doo - wop so much , he said there may even more songs to come : " we had 12 songs and we ended up doing 23			1
so there will probably be a part two and a part three , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
@entity1 said the inspiration for the album comes from childhood memories of his hometown and his family			1
his older brother @entity36 introduced him to doo - wop			1
" he was a singer , " @entity1 said			1
" he had this doo - wop group ... and i got to play with them and go up and down @entity40 and @entity41			1

" he provided a lot of comfort to fans from @entity2 after @entity65			0
he met displaced @entity66 all over the country as he toured , and many of them were grateful to be reminded of home			0
" it felt good that we would give , that we could make somebody feel good , because i know i was feeling -- and i 'm sure they were feeling the same way -- your whole everything just was gone			0
" even though @entity1 often returns to his hometown to perform , he has not returned to his home in @entity80 since @entity65			2
much of that area was decimated by the storm and flood waters			0
he and his family evacuated to @entity85 , and the singer eventually made his way to @entity88 , which has become his new home			0
@entity88 is also where he recorded " @entity16 , " which was a project that included several musical heavyweights			0

" and @entity1 still has some other artists he 'd like to work with , he said			1
" i 'd like to work with @entity108 , @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , @entity111			1
and i heard @entity112 -- she was imitating me on ' @entity113 ' and i think she can sing			0
" besides collaborations , @entity1 may be diving into yet another genre soon			2
