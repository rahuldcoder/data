the first ten months of 2014 have been the hottest since record keeping began more than 130 years ago , according to data from the @entity2			1
that may be hard to believe for people in places like @entity6 , @entity7 , which saw a record early snowfall this year			2
but @entity2 says , despite the early bitter cold across parts of the @entity13 in recent weeks , it 's been a hot year so far for the @entity14			1
with two months left on the calendar , 2014 is shaping up to be the hottest year on record			2
the average global temperature between january and october has been 0.68 degrees @entity18 ( 1.22 degrees @entity19 ) higher than the 20th century 's average global temperature of 14.1 @entity21 )			1
@entity2 's analysis is an important " health gauge " indicating an ominous trend for the planet , says @entity27 meteorologist @entity26			0
" it 's becoming increasingly more difficult to be a skeptic of the causes of our warming planet , " he says			0
hottest october this october was the hottest october on record globally , @entity2 data showed			1
the mercury climbed more than one degree fahrenheit above the 20th century average of 57.1 @entity39 it was the fourth warmest october on record for the @entity13 , @entity2 said			1
" the record high october temperature was driven by warmth across the globe over both the land and ocean surfaces and was fairly evenly distributed between the @entity47 and @entity48 , " the agency said			1
that 's significant , says @entity26			0
" most notably , this record warmth is not contained to any specific part of the world			0
meaning , we are all in this together , " he says			0
" so far this year , record - breaking warmth has been observed in at least every continent and major ocean basin of our planet			2
this is something we can not ignore			0
" important benchmark @entity2 's analysis breaks down global temperatures into two categories -- land and ocean -- then an average that includes both			1
the record high temperatures in october were recorded across both land and sea			2
the surface temperature on land approached an important scientific benchmark			2
it was almost 2 degrees @entity18 higher than the 20th century average for october of 9.3 @entity76 )			0
scientists have long predicted that a change in global average temperature of just 2 to 3 degrees higher could spell disaster for the planet , contributing to catastrophic storms , sea level rise , dangerous storm surges and melting polar ice			1
according to the non-binding international agreement on climate change -- the @entity88 , reached in 2009 -- any temperature increase above the 2 degree celsius mark is " dangerous			0
" @entity2 said the ocean temperatures were also the warmest on record in october with an increase of 1.12 f over the 20th century average of 60.6 degrees			1
hot spots " record warmth for the year - to - date was particularly notable across much of northern and western @entity100 , parts of @entity102 @entity102 , and large areas of the northeastern and western equatorial @entity104 , " @entity2 said			1
" it is also notable that record warmth was observed in at least some areas of every continent and major ocean basin around the world , " the agency added			0
of particular note , several countries have already seen an average temperature increase of more than 2 degrees @entity18 in october 2014 compared to 20th century averages , including @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity120			0
there was also one notable cold spot on the map			0
the average temperature this year in the midsection of the @entity13 , which saw a severe winter , has been below the 20th century average .			2

@entity2 : global temperatures pushing record highs this year
new study finds average global temperatures approaching " dangerous " benchmark
@entity2 data looked at land and ocean *conditions* , then averaged the numbers
parts of @entity100 , @entity102 saw more *extreme* temperature hike
