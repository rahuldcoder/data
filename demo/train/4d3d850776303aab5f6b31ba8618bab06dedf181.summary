-- @entity1 may be the fattest state in the country			1
and it may be among the least educated and have provided the backdrop to some of the country 's most heinous displays of racism			0
and you can dismiss its lawmakers as just a bunch of dumb , backwoods hicks if you think that makes for good humor in other parts of the country			0
but then consider this : it 's possible its legislature has cannily unlocked a way to make abortion illegal without having to overturn @entity24			1
the state has instituted a series of unreasonable regulations for doctors who perform abortions			1
using a practice very similar to the kind of bottlenecking that was done to suppress black votes during the @entity35 era , @entity1 has systematically squeezed the number of abortion clinics in the state down to just one			1
and if a federal court ultimately finds its new regulations constitutional , that one will be gone too			2
( wednesday , a federal judge extended his temporary order to let the clinic stay open )			2
in other words , @entity1 , the dumb little state that supposedly could n't , will effectively become the leader in what some call a regressive movement -- though a recent @entity46 poll suggests it 's not as out - of - touch as they may think			1
fifty percent of @entity55 identify as pro-life and from 1995 to 2010 , some 600 abortion - related laws have passed on the state level			1
and it would seem the anti-abortion movement is picking up steam			0
within the first six months of 2011 , 162 new anti-abortion provisions were implemented around the country			0
for those keeping score , that also coincides with the rise of the tea party movement			0
but when one looks at that astounding spike in the numbers running in tandem with the tea party - led attack on @entity72 that strangled the debt ceiling debate , the likelihood that it 's all just one big coin - ki - dink is a tough sell			0
and keep in mind that @entity1 , arguably the most conservative state in the country , is not some outlier			1
a fifth of the nation wants all abortions to be illegal			1
only 41 % view themselves as pro-choice , while 52 % believe abortion should only be legal under certain circumstances , such as rape			2
@entity55 continues to struggle with this issue ; it 's small wonder that @entity1 is able to exploit this			1
my own view lies somewhere in the middle : i 'm against abortion ... so i refuse to have one			2
seeing how i 've never had an unwanted or life - threatening pregnancy , i do n't feel equipped to tell complete strangers in those circumstances what they should do with their bodies			2
i 'd argue that this view is no more absurd than watching four @entity102 presidential candidates debate the topic of abortion last winter with not one of them using the word " woman " in any form			2
it is also absurd that a female , @entity111 lawmaker in @entity112 was barred from speaking in the @entity102 controlled @entity113 because that body felt using the word " vagina " in a debate about abortion violated decorum			2
what 's also absurd ? that liberals continue to think they can change the national dialogue about this topic and other controversial issues simply by making fun of stereotypical people from the @entity127			0
earlier this year , @entity129 's filmmaker daughter , @entity128 , conducted a round of interviews there for @entity134 's " @entity133			0
" some of the comments she came back with , such as that @entity137 was a " half - breed , " were indeed ignorant and did not surprise me at all			0
but dismissing @entity1 in this abortion debate misses the magnitude of the decision that could end up prevailing			1
this is n't just about the 20th state in the @entity144			1
if the judge eventually lifts the injunction to the law , it may present the blueprint that conservative lawmakers use in the other 49 in an effort to outlaw all abortions			0
for decades , liberals and conservatives have been fighting to find the answer to this great riddle : whose rights should take precedence -- the mother 's or that of the unborn child she is carrying ? what @entity1 lawmakers have done is said to hell with the answer , and instead opted to eliminate the riddle all together			1
you can call it a war on women , you can call it misogyny run amok , you can call it covert theocracy ; it does n't really matter			0
the end result is this : reproductive health is about to get a face - lift , whether it wants one or not			0
because even if the @entity1 law is ruled unconstitutional ( in 1992 the @entity179 said no state shall impose laws that places undue burden on women seeking an abortion ) , that wo n't stop copycats in other parts of the country from massaging what the state did in hopes of creating a law that will hold up in the books			1
not bad for a state that 's routinely made into a punch line			0
if the court rules in its favor , i guess we 'll know who has the last laugh			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

@entity203 : @entity1 ca n't be dismissed in its efforts to *restrict* abortions
why ? because its new regulations on abortion doctors could force last clinic from state
@entity214 : this is a canny way to make abortion illegal ; if upheld , other states may try approach
@entity214 : liberals may mock the state , but it may have found a way around @entity24
