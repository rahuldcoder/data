-- smiling children are using prosthetic hands to open windows through which we can glimpse the future of health care -- a future where outsiders and amateurs innovate along with insiders and professionals			1
the question is , " @entity14 lead the way , as it has for a century , or will it fall behind , as it has begun to do ? " my forthcoming @entity17 research " @entity26 in @entity27 " argues that leading requires us to abandon the partisan rancor over health insurance ( " @entity22 " vs. " repeal and replace " ) and focus , instead , on innovating our way to better health			2
@entity29 - approved prosthetic hands cost around $ 40,000			1
several years ago , a @entity31 carpenter lost some fingers in an accident and collaborated with a @entity35 puppetmaker to invent a vastly more affordable device			0
they adapted a 19th - century metal - and - whalebone design for a 21st - century @entity40 printer to produce a hand that allows users to drive , ride bikes , play ball , grasp objects and feel normal and complete			1
printed hands require only a few hours of assembly time , and materials ( essentially a special glue , string and screws ) cost between $ 10 and $ 50 -- 1/1000 the cost of professional models			1
the proliferation of printed hands began when @entity56 at the @entity57 formed e-nable , a global , web - based social network , to connect people who need hands with people who are interested in building them			1
@entity62 quickly began modifying the hands			1
one added an extra thumb so his son could grasp objects more easily			0
a student designed a hand that rotates at the wrist just as natural hands can but which $ 40,000 prosthetics ca n't			1
children designed hands that mimic those of comic - book superheroes -- earning the envy of classmates			1
professional prosthetics are much more elaborate , but at $ 40,000 a pop , they are n't practical for growing children			1
a fashion designer created stunningly beautiful hands for a fellow student			2
3 - d printed hands are evolving at breathtaking speed because of what my @entity17 colleague @entity85 calls " permissionless innovation			1
" no one has to beg permission from anyone to design , modify or distribute hands			2
that would n't be true if the hands included sensors and / or motors or if they were sold , rather than given away			2
regulators would likely swoop in , and innovation would slow			2
@entity99 innovation is largely alien to health care			1
new drugs , devices and procedures typically wait for years as regulators sort through stacks of proposals and tons of data			0
the film " @entity109 " is based on the true story of an @entity112 victim , 30 days from death , who was denied lifesaving treatment because the @entity29 wanted extra years of testing to assure safety and effectiveness			2
the greatest example of permissionless innovation is the internet			1
in the early 1990s , the federal government surrendered control over the @entity120 and enabled commercial developers to make full use of the system			0
once that happened , professionals and amateurs produced software , hardware and apps in ways and at speeds no one could have foreseen			0
an @entity134 of 25 years ago could scarcely believe our world of @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
none of this would have happened had there been a @entity149 judging each innovation			2
if you think , " but health care is different , " keep in mind that it would have been equally easy in 1989 to demand heavy regulation of a frightening new communication technology			1
the @entity120 raises risks of online fraud , sexual predators , coordinated terrorism , identity theft and privacy violations			0
if such things as @entity165 , @entity168 's safety and connectivity system , or hospital connectivity fails , people can die			0
somehow , we decided to accept these risks to enjoy the benefits			0
health care may change as much by 2039 as consumer electronics did since 1989			1
we 'll likely see @entity40 printed transplantable organs , drugs tailor - made to patients ' personal dna , nanobots to repair damaged genes and artificial intelligence to guide people toward wellness			1
excessive regulation , however , can bring these processes to a crawl			0
@entity85 says , " trying to preemptively plan for every hypothetical worst - case scenario means the best - case scenarios will never come about			0
" the innovations will happen in @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and elsewhere if not here			0
and to compete , we have to accept some risks and open the door to some outside innovators			0
no one suggests completely deregulated health care			1
the question is one of degree and design			0
already , @entity190 surpasses the @entity134 in drug availability , thanks to its more decentralized approval process			0
we can suggest an @entity206 : for better products at lower cost , you must allow reasonable risk - taking ( by consumers and producers ) , and you must allow unknown outsiders to introduce unexpected genius into the process			2
the printed hand shows us how			0
the task is to apply its lessons across health care			1
talking about innovation will be a lot more fun and incredibly more productive than squabbling over @entity22			0
rise of ' cyberathletes ' could change sport as we know it			0

@entity227 printers are opening up *possibilities* for low - cost prosthetics
@entity29 - approved prosthetic hands , for example , can cost $ 40,000 . printed ones , about $ 50
he says " permissionless innovation " lets design of @entity40 printed hands quickly evolve
@entity240 : such *unleashed* innovation should be applied across all of health care
