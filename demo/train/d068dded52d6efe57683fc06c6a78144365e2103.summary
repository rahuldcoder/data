-- in an effort to understand why a truck serving as a parade float crossed in front of a fast - moving locomotive last week , killing four war veterans on the float , federal accident investigators on tuesday will re-create the accident conditions			1
the @entity10 will stage a locomotive and a truck at the railroad crossing in @entity14 , @entity15 , to measure the sight distances between the two			1
the test will answer the question : " what could be seen , when , ( and ) where ? " board member @entity19 said			2
the test comes as investigators this week examine a wealth of information about the crash , including several videos that captured the moments leading up to impact			1
they also are reviewing interviews with the train 's engineer and conductor and are making plans to interview the truck driver			2
the accident happened late thursday afternoon during the " @entity41 " parade to honor members of the @entity40 military			1
the last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing the tracks when an eastbound @entity46 train slammed into it , @entity14 police said			1
the safety board said the grade crossing warning system -- consisting of a bell , lights and a gate -- operated as designed , giving a 20 - second warning of the train 's arrival			2
but the truck entered the crossing , and the gate lowered , tipping over flag stands on the float , safety board investigators said			1
some people were able to jump off the truck in time , witnesses said			2
but first responders found two dead at the scene , and two others were later pronounced dead at @entity67			2
fifteen others were injured , some seriously			0
those killed were identified as @entity72 chief warrant officer 3 @entity70 , 37 , @entity74 sgt. maj. @entity73 , 47 , @entity74 sgt. @entity75 , 34 , and @entity74 sgt. maj. @entity76 , 43			0
the safety board did not speculate or hint at the cause of the crash , but instead cited a number of facts that appeared not to be factors			0
the train was traveling 62 mph , the safety board said , under the 70 mph speed limit			0
no anomalies have been found in the grade crossing warning system , @entity19 said			0
nor have investigators found any mechanical problem with the train 's air brakes , nor defects with the tracks , @entity19 said			0
@entity19 said the south traffic light at the grade crossing turned green 21 seconds before the train 's arrival at the crossing , as designed , to allow traffic time to clear the crossing			0
at 20 seconds before the collision , the bells and lights on the mast activated , in keeping with the minimum time under federal law			1
at 13 seconds before the collision , the gate started coming down , and a second later , the front of the truck crossed the north rail of the tracks			1
the engineer sounded the horn nine seconds before impact			0
at seven seconds before impact , the lowering gate struck flagpoles on the float			1
the train 's emergency brakes were applied five seconds before impact , but it took the train 75 seconds to come to a complete stop , @entity19 said			0
@entity19 said investigators would remain on the scene through much of this week and said a conclusion to their work is months away			1
investigators are reviewing video from a forward - facing camera on the locomotive , and video from a dashboard camera on a police cruiser that was behind the parade float , @entity19 said			1
they are also examining information on a data event recorder on the train , which recorded the train 's speed , horn , etc. the grade crossing where the accident occurred had been designated a " quiet zone			0
" typically , trains blast their horns a quarter mile before a crossing			0
but the city of @entity14 applied to designate the crossing a quiet zone			1
@entity19 said alternative safety measures are provided in quiet zones			0
" our investigators will now be looking at exactly what those safety measures were and whether they were in place at the time of the accident , " he said			0
the safety board will also be looking at the parade permits to see what conditions were placed on the parade and whether those conditions were met .			2
