the @entity20 issued a hurricane watch for most of the @entity4 coast , from @entity23 , @entity4 , to the state 's northern border with @entity26 , including the @entity27 and @entity28			1
it called @entity7 " large and intense			1
" @entity7 , which quickly morphed into a category 4 hurricane on monday , dealt a glancing blow to @entity33 and the @entity34 , downing trees and knocking out power lines			1
tuesday , the hurricane was passing the @entity38 and @entity39			1
@entity7 will approach within 60 miles of @entity40 , @entity4 , early friday morning , according to @entity2 meteorologist @entity41			1
hurricane - force winds will be possible along the @entity43 of @entity4 beginning early on friday morning and lasting until at least midday , he said			1
@entity41 forecast @entity7 will pass within 60 miles of @entity44 , @entity45 , as a strong category 1 or category 2 hurricane overnight friday			1
however , sustained hurricane - force winds should not affect coastal @entity45 as the majority of winds will be tropical - storm force beginning friday afternoon and lasting until midday on saturday , he said			1
as of 8 p.m. et , the center of @entity7 was about 125 miles ( 235 kilometers ) east - northeast of @entity53 and about 835 miles ( 1,545 kilometers ) south - southeast of @entity40 , @entity4 , according to the @entity20			1
it was heading northwest at about 14 mph ( 22 kph )			1
the hurricane 's core was " passing well east of the @entity38 and @entity39 , " the hurricane center said			1
" tropical storm conditions are probably affecting the vicinity of the @entity38 and @entity39			1
weather conditions will likely improve in these islands on wednesday			2
" @entity7 's maximum sustained winds are at 135 mph ( 215 kph )			1
it is a large storm , with hurricane - force winds stretching 90 miles ( 150 km ) from its center and tropical storm - force winds extending outward some 200 miles ( 325 kilometers )			1
" some fluctuations in intensity are likely , but @entity7 is forecast to retain category 4 status for the next day or two , " the hurricane center said			1
the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity26 , has ordered ships in its area to prepare to head to sea within 24 hours if conditions worsen , according to @entity79 , a spokeswoman for the @entity72			2

the @entity72 also issued on tuesday a " @entity84 4 , " which tells people living and working around the @entity73 area to be prepared for " destructive winds " within 72 hours and to take the proper precautions			1

the federal group stressed it does not make evacuation decisions			2
even without making landfall , hurricanes can trigger dangerous rip currents -- a narrow channel of water that flows seaward from beaches			0
the currents can be strong enough to carry even experienced swimmers into deeper water			0
on tuesday , a @entity134 coastal advisory was in effect for the eastern coast of @entity1 , mostly due to @entity7 's presence in the @entity138			1
the advisory warned that dangerous rip currents and rough surf are possible			0
" dozens of rescues along with one surf - related fatality were reported over the past few days in very hazardous ocean conditions , " the advisory said			0
over the weekend , hundreds of rescues took place in @entity148 and elsewhere because of rip currents spawned by then - @entity150 , which stayed well offshore			0
@entity150 has since lost its tropical characteristics and moved out into the open @entity154			0
a tropical storm warning remained in effect for the @entity38 and @entity39 , and a tropical storm watch was in effect for the southeastern @entity159			1
those areas could experience above - normal tides , along with " large and dangerous battering waves " on tuesday , forecasters said			0
a tropical storm watch is also in effect for the @entity4 coast between @entity168 , @entity4 and @entity23 , @entity4 , the hurricane center said			1
@entity7 could dump between 1 and 3 inches of rain on the @entity38 and @entity39 and the @entity159 , with up to 6 inches possible in some areas , the hurricane center said			1
but forecasters said conditions on @entity33 and the @entity34 , including gusty winds , were expected to improve as @entity7 departed , and storm surge flooding and waves will diminish			1
" we were quite fortunate because there was no direct hit in this case , " @entity33 gov. @entity177 told @entity2 's " @entity181			0
" but , he said , the island experienced " lots of rain " and some high winds			2
as of tuesday morning , 174,000 customers were without power , he said , and 33,000 lacked water service			0
" there are some roads that are blocked because trees have fallen , " @entity177 said			0
" those are being removed as we speak , and hopefully we 'll be able to get back to normal during the course of the day and tomorrow will be a regular working day			0
" @entity196 , @entity90 federal coordinating official , told reporters tuesday that close to 200,000 were without power on @entity33 , and officials were focusing on restoration			0
about 160 people spent monday night in 18 shelters on the island , he said , and 57 people took refuge in four shelters in the @entity207			0
however , both locations " fared very well , " @entity196 said			0
schools were expected to reopen wednesday , he said			0
transportation from @entity33 to the outlying islands of @entity212 and @entity213 had resumed , and ports in the @entity34 and @entity33 were reopening tuesday			0
a @entity215 showed sheets of torrential rain on @entity33 , along with gusty winds			2
other ireports showed downed trees and flooding on @entity222 and @entity223 in the @entity34			0
residents were being asked to stay home so that downed trees and power lines could be removed , @entity177 said			0
@entity33 and the @entity207 could see an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain as @entity7 pulls away , the @entity20 said on tuesday			1
another storm could be poised to deliver a one - two punch to @entity33 and other areas of the @entity138			0
@entity232 developed on monday and appeared to be following in @entity7 's footsteps			1
it remained a weak tropical storm as of tuesday , the @entity20 said			0
however , it was enough to prompt a tropical storm warning for @entity237 and @entity238 and a tropical storm watch for @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity222 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247			2
a tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions , including winds of at least 39 mph , are forecast within 36 hours			1
a tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours			2
@entity252 said @entity232 is not projected to affect @entity33 and the @entity34 , but could affect @entity253 by the weekend			0
" interests elsewhere in the northern @entity256 should monitor the progress of @entity232 , " forecasters said			0
" additional watches or warnings may be required for a portion of the area			0
" as of 8 p.m. , the center of @entity232 was located about 300 miles ( 485 kilometers ) east - southeast of the @entity256			2
it had winds of about 40 mph ( 65 kph ) and was moving west - northwest at about 24 mph ( 39 kph )			1
some slow strengthening is possible over the next day or two , forecasters said			0
" we are following what the @entity134 is telling us " on @entity232 , @entity177 told @entity2			0
" they 're telling us that it is not as organized as @entity7			2
however , it could bring about some rain , and that 's what concerns me			0
so we 'll just keep a very close eye on it and see what happens			0
" @entity2 's @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			0
