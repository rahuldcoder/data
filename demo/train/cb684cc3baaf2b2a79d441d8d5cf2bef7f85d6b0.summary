@entity0 , @entity1 -- before dawn on friday , a man wearing an @entity1 uniform shot and killed three @entity7 soldiers during a meeting to discuss local security issues in the southern province of @entity11			1
it was one of an unprecedented series of five attacks by people in @entity1 security forces uniforms in the past week against @entity18 forces			1
if the trend over the past few months continues , @entity18 troops in @entity1 face a rapidly growing threat			1
it is compounded by the strategy of withdrawing all combat troops by the end of 2014 , which will increasingly leave relatively isolated international military advisors embedded with @entity1 soldiers			1
attacks believed to be connected to @entity1 security forces have already killed 34 @entity18 service members this year , drawing close to the record 36 international soldiers killed in similar attacks in 2011 , according to data compiled by the @entity34			1
nineteen of the 34 @entity18 troops killed this year were @entity7 soldiers , while 15 @entity7 service members were killed in such attacks in 2011			2
these attacks now constitute 8 % of the total number of @entity7 soldiers killed in @entity1 this year			2
in 2011 , this number was closer to 4 %			0
the targeting of @entity7 and other @entity18 soldiers by members of the @entity1 security forces first spiked in 2009 , and the number of incidents has gone up each year since			1
in friday 's attack in @entity11 , three @entity7 @entity48 soldiers were killed			0
an @entity1 official told reporters that a commander at a police checkpoint had invited them to a predawn meal and security discussion , where he opened fire on the @entity7 before fleeing to take refuge with @entity59 militants			0
" now , he is with us , " a @entity59 spokesman claimed , identifying the attacker as a police commander named @entity63 who had been helping @entity7 forces train @entity1 policemen			0
if this version of events is correct , the attack was premeditated and carefully planned -- likely with the help of the @entity59 , who have claimed a role in about half of such attacks -- known as " green - on - blue " incidents -- since the beginning of the war			0
a @entity18 military official tells @entity2 that , in fact , only 11 % of such incidents can be definitively attributed to the @entity59			0
the motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to classify because the perpetrator is either dead or has fled			0
according to media accounts of such incidents , many of the " green - on - blue " attacks appear to have taken place after an argument between @entity1 and international troops , or because of an @entity1 soldier 's personal grievances			2
a @entity93 report in april explains " investigations have determined that a large majority of green - on - blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the @entity98 [ @entity98 ] but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel			0
" in 2011 , @entity7 military behavioral scientist dr. @entity101 interviewed more than 600 @entity1 soldiers and policemen and found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of @entity106 soldiers			0
the @entity1 security forces aired grievances ranging from @entity18 soldiers ' supposedly indiscriminate fire that killed civilians to the public searching of @entity1 soldiers outside @entity18 bases , as well as @entity7 soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their @entity1 counterparts			1
another likely cause of the increase in the number of green - on - blue incidents is straightforward : in the past two years the size of the @entity1 army and police force has almost doubled from around 200,000 to around 350,000			2
this may also have contributed to a recent spike in the number of @entity1 security forces turning their guns on their own @entity1 colleagues			1
according to the @entity18 military official who spoke with @entity2 , there were 39 such " green - on - green " incidents last year and already 31 this year			0
to combat the green - on - blue problem , @entity7 and @entity1 officials have implemented tighter vetting for @entity1 army and police recruits , and now designate one @entity7 soldier -- known as a " guardian angel " -- in those @entity141 units working with @entity1 security forces whose job is solely to guard against attacks while @entity7 forces eat , sleep or exercise , the @entity132 reported			1
a senior @entity18 military official tells @entity2 that the coalition has also increased the number of counterintelligence officers in the field to ferret out @entity59 double agents			2
but once all @entity18 combat troops have left @entity1 at the end of 2014 any advisors who will remain will rely entirely on @entity1 forces for their security , leaving them acutely vulnerable to green - on - blue attacks .			1
