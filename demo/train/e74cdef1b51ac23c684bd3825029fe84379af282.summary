-- @entity2 's release of " 50/50 " in september received praise from top critics , but did n't do as well at the box office			1
the movie , starring @entity7 and @entity8 , is screenwriter @entity10 's humorous take on his own experiences as a cancer patient			1
" everything that we put in the movie , we wanted it to feel like it was real and honest , " says @entity10 in an interview with @entity0 's dr. @entity14			1
critics give credit to movies , such as " 50/50 , " that they believe deliver a sense of authenticity and evoke an emotional response			1
to patients like @entity26 , cancer - themed movies do not accurately portray the truth behind real - life cancer diagnoses			1
" ' 50/50 ' was a great start , but the majority of movies reinforce the stigma that to be a ' certified ' cancer patient you must appear weak , decrepit and on your death bed , " says @entity26 , a breast cancer patient of the @entity30 in @entity31			2
many patients also feel that some of these movies fail to show the daily physical and mental effects of cancer			2
for @entity51 , a colon cancer patient in @entity52 , " movies tend to miss the realism of the day - to - day negative impact from having this disease or the impact the treatments have on the total body			2
" although movies such as " @entity55 , " " @entity56 " and " a walk to remember " tried to focus on the effects of the disease , they still received lukewarm reviews			0
the @entity61 ' @entity60 said " @entity55 " was " ... too soft , too easy and it dissolves like a tear - soaked tissue			0
" meanwhile , @entity63 critiqued " @entity56 " as " ... superficial , manipulative and schmaltzy			0
" the star power leading some of the plots may encourage viewers to watch , yet audience response overall is similar to the critics			0
" a walk to remember " grossed a modest box office total of $ 41,281,092 while the @entity70 said it " ... scrapes the bottom of the melodramatic barrel			0
" on the other hand , some cancer patients and survivors can relate to these movies and find them comforting in their own way			1
" i think they drive the reality for those that were impacted , " says @entity79 , founder and president of the @entity81 , a volunteer organization that provides financial assistance for cancer patients			1
" it reminds you of the importance of life -- the importance of every moment and not to waste it on things that are n't of value			0
" some films help to deliver a greater appreciation of life			0
to many viewers , these movies provide a platform that brings a sense of comfort			0
@entity10 agrees saying , " everyone 's affected by cancer ... but after screening the movie , people are much more open about sharing their own stories , and talking about the different ordeals they 've gone through to one another			2

" 50/50 " is one of @entity2 's many cancer - themed films *moviegoers* did not rush to see
critics praised the movie yet *shunned* similar ones that failed to give a sense of realness
some cancer patients believe these movies do not accurately portray real - life cancer cases
