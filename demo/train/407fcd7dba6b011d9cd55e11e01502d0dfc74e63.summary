air traffic controllers may be taking more risks in handling airliners under a 2 - year - old rule allowing them to report errors without fear of punishment , congressional investigators say in a report highlighting a spike in incidents			1
controllers and the @entity13 , however , say the rule has actually improved safety			0
the report by the @entity16 -- which notes a 53 percent increase in controller errors within five miles of airports and a 166 percent jump in errors handling approaching flights up to 40 miles out -- comes at a time of remarkable commercial aviation safety in the @entity25			1
the nation has not seen a fatal airliner crash since 2009 , the same year the rule went into effect			0
the increase in errors " began a notable climb in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 , peaked in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 , and remained at rates higher than the historical average through the second quarter of 2011 , " the @entity16 said in its report			2
the @entity13 says the jump coincides with the non-punitive reporting rule , which took effect in july 2009			1
that system encourages air traffic controllers to voluntarily report errors so that dangerous patterns can be identified and the system can be made safer , the agency said			1
the system , which protects controllers who report efforts from legal or disciplinary action , has " produced a wealth of information to help the @entity13 identify potential risks in the system and make corrections , " @entity13 spokeswoman @entity47 said			2
" more information will help us find problems and take action before an accident happens , " she said			0
but the @entity16 said @entity13 officials who are not identified in the report told investigators that the system also may reduce personal accountability and " may make some air traffic controllers less risk averse in certain situations			1
" that may have led to more errors , according to the @entity16 , which also said some @entity13 officials told them the rule also limits the ability of managers to take action against employees who make a mistake			1
the @entity16 also said 65 % of the errors reported through the non-punitive system , some of which may have involved violations of the standards separating aircraft in flight , were not fed into a separate @entity13 reporting system for operational errors			1
that may have reduced the number of errors directly reported to @entity13 supervisors , the @entity16 said			1
rep. @entity93 , the @entity94 chairman and one of six @entity97 members who requested the @entity16 study , said the spike in errors raises significant concerns			0
" @entity105 and @entity13 controllers alike share credit for the safety record we enjoy today , " @entity93 , a @entity103 @entity102 , said in a written statement			2
" however , the recent uptick in near miss events is a precursor to tragedy			0
" but @entity113 , president of the @entity114 , said his take on the report is that it shows the @entity13 has " taken several steps to further improve safety at and around airports			0
" @entity120 , president of the @entity121 , said he supports the @entity13 's non-punitive reporting system , saying it is bringing to light errors that would have gone unreported under the old system			1
but he said the new system , by itself , can not explain all of the increases in controller errors			2
" a jump is inevitable when you change your reporting system			0
you worry if you do n't have a jump because you feel like something has n't worked , " @entity120 said			0
" but when you look underneath these numbers , as @entity16 has done very carefully , you ca n't explain everything away by a change of reporting			0
it looks like there 's some substance to it too , and that has to be dealt with			0

@entity13 's non-punitive reporting system took effect in july 2009
since then , reporting of controller errors has risen *dramatically*
@entity16 says system may reduce personal accountability , " risk - averse " *behavior*
@entity13 , controllers union say the reporting system has made @entity25 air travel safer
