@entity14 's memoir , " @entity15 : my journey to @entity23 with @entity5 , " is the first book written by anyone directly involved in the @entity19 murder trial in @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity24 , a 21 - year - old @entity10 student , was found stabbed to death in the @entity21 apartment she shared with @entity27 , now 25 , of @entity28			1
@entity14 and @entity27 were convicted of @entity24 's murder in 2009 but set free on appeal in 2011			1
they face a final high - court decision in march			0
judge explains murder acquittal @entity21 prosecutors appeal decision @entity19 of @entity37 was convicted separately in 2008			1
his conviction was upheld on appeal in 2009			0
@entity14 's book draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends , family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison , the preface says			1
he chronicles the day of the murder , admitting that he and @entity27 smoked marijuana that afternoon , which he says he regretted because it clouded his memory of what happened			1
while maintaining his innocence , he says he does not clearly remember even if @entity27 spent the night with him			2
he and @entity27 made mistakes the morning of the discovery , including trusting police investigators , he writes			2
@entity14 writes that at times , he was uncomfortable with @entity27 's " bizarre behavior , " which he says prosecutors used against both of them			1
" of all the things that @entity5 did that day , nothing attracted more criticism than her failure to raise the alarm as soon as she saw so many things out of place , " he writes			2
" it was n't just the police who attacked her			0
many @entity21 , including most of my family , could not fathom how she could go ahead with her shower after finding blood on the tap , much less put her wet feet on the bath mat , which was also stained , and drag it across the floor			0
" neither he nor @entity27 had solid alibis for the night of @entity24 's murder , @entity14 writes			1
" we had no real alibi for the night of november 1 except each other , and we did not have lawyers to protect us , and we seemed to have a propensity for saying things without thinking them through , " he says			0
@entity14 describes his doubt about @entity27 's innocence at times , referring to the night the two were arrested			1
" when i first found out about what @entity5 had signed her name to , i was furious , " he writes			1
" okay , she was under a lot of pressure , as i had been , but how could she just invent stuff out of nowhere ? " he gives an account of his life inside several @entity21 prisons , where he befriended rapists and murderers , played with cockroaches and scrubbed the cells of dirt and mold			0
while sharing his family 's personal stories and sagas during the lengthy trial , the book gives very little attention to the evidence presented in court			0
the revelations include how he distrusted the lawyers his father hired for him			0
they were intent on getting @entity14 to abandon @entity27 and accuse her of the murder , he wrote			1
' @entity5 ' : sex , violence and media hysteria at one time after the first conviction , @entity14 's father sought the help of a private lawyer not connected to the case , who spoke to @entity20 prosecutor @entity131 about striking a plea deal to cut @entity14 's sentence in exchange for evidence against @entity27			1
@entity14 's lead attorney , @entity136 , a prominent parliamentarian , almost walked off the case because of the backroom deal			2
@entity131 declined to comment about the book or the case until the high court appeal is completed			0
@entity14 's book is especially hard on @entity131 , whom he accuses of concocting a " conspiracy - laden plotline from @entity144 " instead of a normal investigation			2
he laments the star treatment @entity27 received , saying the prosecution focused squarely on his co-defendant			2
he wrote that he believed he was arrested as a way to get to @entity27			1
" i do n't think the prosecution or police ever seriously thought of me as a murderer , " he wrote			0
" they had one overriding reason to arrest me , throw me into solitary confinement , and threaten me with life imprisonment , and that was to pressure me into rolling over and testifying against @entity5			2
" @entity14 condemns his treatment by @entity20 police who , he says , would not give him food or access to a lawyer during the questioning , even though it was clear to him that they were treating him as a suspect and not just a person informed of the facts of the case			2
@entity14 gave several spontaneous declarations during both the original and appellate trials , but he never took the stand in his own defense			0
the book offers many details from behind the scenes during the four years between when @entity24 was killed and when the two were released , but it does not answer all the questions about what happened that night			0
@entity14 wrote that he believed that @entity180 acted alone in killing @entity24			1
in the epilogue , @entity14 recounts how he went to visit @entity27 in @entity28 last fall , but how he was nervous to see her			1
" i was n't at all sure it was a good idea and i continued to waver back and forth even after i booked my ticket			0
we had been through so much ; perhaps we owed it to each other to live our lives and leave each other in peace			0
" @entity180 is writing a book but does not have a publisher , according to his lawyers			0
@entity27 's book is due to be released in the spring			0
@entity27 signs book deal with @entity197			0
