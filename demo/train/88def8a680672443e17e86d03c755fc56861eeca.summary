police identified a man from @entity23 as the logistical mastermind			0
police allege the man stayed at a luxury hotel in @entity2 , but also booked a room at the @entity43 hotel where @entity9 was killed			1
the @entity23 suspect requested room 237 -- directly across from where @entity9 was staying in room 230 , police say , but the suspect apparently never stayed there			2

before leaving , police said , the group took great care to make sure the room looked orderly , removing anything that might indicate that @entity9 resisted			2
the suspects also deliberately turned the safety lock on the room door from the inside in order to suggest the death was normal , police said			2
police did not provide details about the nature of the killing in its statement monday , but authorities have told @entity9 's family that there were signs of five or six electric shocks on his legs , behind his ears , on his genitals and heart			1
blood on a pillow led police to believe he was suffocated			0
