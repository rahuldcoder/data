@entity0 -- social media site @entity2 just received another $ 225 million in funding			1
the offering , led by @entity5 , puts the company 's valuation at a staggering $ 3.8 billion			2
not bad for a three - year - old social network that has no revenue and is laying the foundations for a business model			0
@entity2 is the digital equivalent of a scrapbook			1
its virtual pin - boards have become a popular place to share pictures and reviews of a wide variety of products -- everything from weddings to home remodels			0
bottom line : people come to @entity2 with more of an intenticon to buy than when visiting other networks like @entity26 and @entity27			1
a visit to the makeup room at @entity1 's @entity0 studios explains it			0
when the hair and makeup artists are n't freshening up our anchors ' faces , you can find the women ( and a couple of guys ) cruising @entity2 for the latest and greatest in makeup supplies			1
when one of them finds a great review , you hear her yell : " check this mascara out ! " and then the other makeup artists crowd around the computer screen to see			0
beneath the photo of the mascara , the user posts details about the product and tips for using it			0
this makes the @entity57 - based site attractive for major companies to create their own pin - boards to promote their products			1
@entity61 is the managing director at @entity62 -- a venture capital firm that has invested in @entity2 -- and he says the strengths are the visual nature of the platform , as well as the size and growth of the social network 's user base			1
@entity2 had nearly 25 million unique monthly users in the @entity72 last month , according to @entity73			1
" people spend a large amount of time on the site , " @entity61 said			0
" that intent is often tied to some commercial experience			0
whether it 's looking for a place to go on vacation or a wedding , that leads to commercial aspects and that 's different from other social networks			0
" he is also encouraged by how @entity2 is starting to attract revenue			1
the company is testing out sponsored pins , which will be their way of advertising			0
but instead of " flashy banners " or pop - up advertisements , @entity2 is weaving ads right into the digital pin boards their users see			1
" they work just like regular pins , only they have a special ' promoted ' label , along with a link to learn more about what that means , " @entity99 , ceo and co-founder of @entity2 , wrote in a blog post in september			2
web analytics might also be a revenue stream for @entity2			2
earlier this year it rolled out tools that give the managers of @entity2 pages insights into how people are interacting with pins that link to their websites			2
retailers might be willing to pay money to learn how to better curate the experience for the customers using @entity2 to get to their websites			2
@entity2 says it will use its $ 225 million , which was first reported by @entity124 , to continue to expand on mobile and international growth			1
meantime , the @entity1 makeup artists continue to cruise the pin boards for the newest and best concealers .			0
