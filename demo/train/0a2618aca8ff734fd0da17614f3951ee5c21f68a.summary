he reached the final at the @entity35 earlier this month and there was a real possibility of the 17 - time grand slam champion making the @entity35 and @entity4 finals in the same year for the first time since claiming both titles in 2006			1
" i could never really get my service games going , " @entity6 told the @entity20 's website			0
" on the return , as the match went on , i think it was that @entity1 started to serve a bit better , which made it more difficult			2
" @entity1 became the first man to break @entity6 in this year 's tournament , perhaps not a surprise since he is second only to @entity3 in percentage of return games won in 2014			2
still , @entity6 led by a break twice in the second set , only to see @entity1 -- whose career has been interrupted by arm and abdominal injuries -- break immediately back			2
the lone break of the third set came in the final game			0
" i think @entity1 does really well controlling the ball , " said @entity6			2
" he has great technique , especially on the backhand , very simple , very short back swings , so he does a really nice job of having good timing			0
" i predict he 's going to be in the top 10 in a short while			0
" @entity1 next faces @entity68 , who defeated @entity69 in straight sets			1
world no. 1 @entity72 , bidding for a maiden triumph in @entity4 , plays big - serving @entity74 and the in - form @entity75 encounters @entity77 in the remaining two men 's quarterfinals .			1
