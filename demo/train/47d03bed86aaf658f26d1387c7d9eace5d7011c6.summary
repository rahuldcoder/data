-- it was announced a few hours before @entity2 , but the appointment of one of the most controversial characters in @entity7 football is no laughing matter for one @entity10 soccer club			1
@entity13 's @entity12 owner @entity11 hopes @entity14 can keep the struggling team in the top flight , but his vice-chairman -- @entity19 mp @entity18 -- has already resigned his role in protest			1
" in the light of the new manager 's past political statements , i think it right to step down , " the ex-foreign secretary said on his website following sunday 's news that @entity14 will replace the sacked @entity25 on a two - and - a - half - year contract			1
@entity18 , who had intended to retain his role at @entity13 despite taking a new job with an international humanitarian organization based in @entity34 which will see him give up his @entity37 constituency , was referring to the @entity39 's right - wing leanings			1
" i am a fascist , not a racist , " @entity14 infamously told @entity39 news agency @entity40 after making a straight - arm salute to the fans of his hometown club @entity43 during a match against @entity46 rival @entity43 in 2005			1
he was later fined and suspended for one match by @entity39 football authorities after another so - called " roman salute " during a match against @entity52			2
a ex-member of @entity43 's notorious hardcore fan group the " @entity55 , " @entity14 admitted in his autobiography that he is " fascinated " by @entity39 's former dictator @entity57 , who enacted anti-semitic laws and oversaw the deporting of thousands of @entity39 @entity60 to concentration and death camps			1
@entity43 has this season been charged four times with racist behavior by its fans			0
@entity14 's politics seem to come in stark conflict with @entity13 's recent attempts to establish itself in the @entity71 market			1
saturday 's home match against @entity73 , a 1 - 0 defeat that proved to be @entity25 's last in charge , marked the start of a collaboration with the foundation of @entity80			2
the former @entity71 leader 's messages of peace and equality will be promoted for the next three years , @entity13 's marketing director @entity81 told @entity0 on friday			1
@entity18 had a key role in the club 's @entity71 push , @entity81 said			1
@entity14 is not a man who has a history of peace -- as a player he was banned for 11 matches for pushing over a referee while at @entity96 club @entity94 in 1998			1
his only previous managerial job , at @entity99 club @entity97 , ended in february when the 44 - year - old quit due to the club 's financial problems			1
his arrival at @entity97 in may 2011 prompted one of the club 's main sponsors -- the @entity109 trade union -- to withdraw its backing due to his political views			1
@entity14 did lead @entity97 out of @entity96 's bottom division , and after he quit said he was ready for a top job in a country where he was widely recognized as one of the most talented players of his era during spells with @entity119 and @entity94			1
" @entity14 is hugely enthused by the challenge that lies ahead of him , " @entity11 said on @entity13 's website			1
" he is passionate , driven and raring to get started			0
" the sole focus of everyone for the next seven games will be to ensure we gain enough points to maintain our top - flight status			0
i think that the chances of that are greatly increased with @entity14 joining us			2
" @entity14 issued a statement through the club on monday insisting that his personal politics had nothing to do with his job , and that past media reports had blown his comments out of proportion			1
" i expressed an opinion in an interview many years ago			0
some pieces were taken for media convenience			0
they took my expression in a very , very negative way -- but it was a long conversation and a long interview			0
it was not fair , " he said			0
" talk about racism ? that is absolutely stupid , stupid and ridiculous			0
the people who know me can change that idea quickly , " he added , saying that former teammates @entity151 and @entity152 -- who are black -- were his best friends when he was playing in @entity96			0
" i do n't want to talk about politics because it 's not my area			0
we are not in the houses of @entity160 , we are in a football club			0
i want to talk about sport			0
i want to talk about football , my players , the board and the fans			0
" @entity13 ceo @entity167 added that the club " has a strong ethos and ethics and that has not changed in any shape or form			2
" " @entity14 is an honest man , a man of principle and a driven , determined and passionate individual			2
to accuse him now , as some have done , of being a racist or having fascist sympathies , is insulting not only to him but to the integrity of this football club , " she said			2
" it is disappointing that some people are trying to turn the appointment of a head coach into a political circus			0
" despite his controversies on and off the pitch , the charismatic @entity14 was popular with many fans of the clubs he played for			2
in 2001 he was given @entity193 's @entity192 for a " special act of good sportsmanship " while playing for @entity119 , when he picked the ball up and refused to score as an opposing goalkeeper lay injured			0
having started his career with @entity43 in 1985 , he went on to play for top @entity200 clubs @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 before a successful season in @entity205 with @entity206 earned him a move to @entity96 .			0
