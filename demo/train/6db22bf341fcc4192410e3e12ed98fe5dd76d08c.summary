-- this is not how @entity2 dreamed it would go			1
he had n't dared to imagine beating the two finest players in men 's tennis to become a grand slam champion			1
the unassuming @entity8 had n't even pictured climbing to no. 3 in the world rankings			2
eclipsing his decorated compatriot @entity10 as @entity8 's top tennis player had never crossed his mind either			2
but that was before sunday , before @entity2 beat @entity14 in four sets to become the @entity17 champion			1
" i never dreamed about that , never expected to be in that situation and that 's just crazy , " the 28 - year - old told @entity0 , the day after his 6 - 3 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 3 over world @entity19 and 13 - time major winner @entity14			1
" you do n't really know what 's happening , i started to tell myself ' you just won a grand slam			1
' it 's something amazing for me			0
" @entity2 even had to take a second glance at the rankings to confirm he had n't been dreaming of his new elevated status in the top four of the men 's games			2
" just checking ! ! ! " he tweeted on monday			0
he need n't have worried			0
@entity2 , seeded eighth in @entity36 , comfortably took the first two sets but surrendered a third to @entity14 , who was playing through the pain barrier with his movement restricted by a back injury sustained in the warm up despite his best efforts @entity14 lacked the power to punish his opponent and @entity2 eventually found himself serving to become @entity8 's second male grand slam champion			1
" i had to really take my time , focus on each point , " explained @entity2 , who after breaking @entity14 for a second time in the fourth set punched himself a few times in the head -- seemingly urging himself to concentrate			1
" he broke me the game before , i was rushing a little bit			0
i knew it was all on me			0
" i knew my serve was good yesterday			0
before match point i took my time , enjoyed the crowd a little bit and tried to make a good plan to win the last point			0
" a forehand was enough for @entity2 to seal success , a new high in a career which also includes men 's doubles @entity67 triumph with @entity10 in 2008			2
" the @entity67 will always be something special for me because it was my first big victory , with @entity10 , a good friend , playing for @entity8 , " he said			2
" i 'm always proud to play for @entity8 and that will always be something really special			0
but i have to say right now , winning a grand slam title ... i 'm really happy with that			1
