-- among the most enduring urban legends about high - level policy - making in the @entity4 government is the proverbial memo with three options : 1			2
find a middle ground and muddle through			0
and yet in truth , @entity10 really does have only three options in @entity13			1
it appears that the president , rightly the avoider - in - chief when it comes to @entity13 , has chosen option three , the least bad alternative			1
do nothing this is n't really an option			1
forget the fact that the president a year ago drew his own red line against @entity28 's use of chemical weapons			1
disregard the reality that this is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since @entity31 used them against the @entity33 in 1988 ; dismiss the fact that 100,000 @entity13 have died in this civil conflict ; and the president is accused of fiddling , @entity37 - like , while @entity13 burns			1
just focus on the events of the past five days in @entity40			0
what has been emanating from administration officials both on and off the record is the most well - advertised and telegraphed military action in the history of modern warfare			0
rarely do we get this kind of preview of the operation , its size and character			0
combine that with the secretary of state @entity55 's brief but powerful statement of moral outrage the other day and the president 's @entity59 interview , and you get as authoritative a commitment to strike as is humanly imaginable			1
indeed , forceful statements and actions of the past few days have now constituted their own red line			0
and if the president does n't enforce it , he will be truly damaged goods when it comes to foreign policy for the remainder of his term			1
neither his regional allies ( @entity75 and the @entity76 ) nor his adversaries ( @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 ) will find him credible or believable			0
as it is now , everyone says no to the @entity4 without much cost or consequence			0
do everything from the beginning , sens. @entity86 and @entity87 and a whole host of liberal interventionists and neoconservatives outside the government have repeatedly called for a more robust policy on @entity13 , even suggesting that the president , by not acting sooner , enabled all of this misery to unfold			1
@entity13 , the president 's critics maintain , is a major threat to @entity4 interests -- and to our allies in the region -- and only a takedown of the @entity28 regime through supporting the opposition and direct application of @entity4 military power will begin to address the problem			1
the argument has not called for boots on the ground but for extensive use of no - fly zones , the use of @entity4 air and missile power to degrade the regime and military support for the opposition			2
president @entity10 has wisely and willfully avoided this approach			1
and he continues to avoid it now			0
the reason has to do with the general problem of an open - ended military commitment and the lack of correlation between the use of @entity4 military power and its relation to the end state			0
@entity13 is in the throes of a brutal civil war			1
the opposition is composed of more than 1,000 disparate rebel groups , the most effective allied with @entity135 and other @entity137 extremists			0
a victory of the latter would be a blow to @entity4 interests			0
ousting @entity28 wo n't be cheap or easy			2
it took eight months to get rid of @entity144 's @entity143 , and he had no weapons of mass destruction , no serious air defenses or military capacity and no credible allies			2
and look at the end result : a @entity154 environment in which there are too many guns , grievances and regional rivalries and no credible central authority			0
and @entity144 pales in comparison with @entity13 's complexities			2
devising a serious military strategy to get rid of @entity28 -- serious weapons for the rebels ; no - fly or - drive zones ; and sustained air / missile strikes against @entity13 military units , infrastructure and leadership targets -- also means @entity4 responsibility for what follows			1
@entity10 has avoided this option because he rightly does n't want @entity4 getting stuck with the check for @entity13			1
muddle through the option the @entity4 is likely to undertake -- focused more narrowly on trying to deter the @entity13 from using chemical weapons again and degrading @entity28 's military capacity in the process -- is far from ideal			1
although i think the administration 's military actions will be far more devastating than the limited strikes being talked about , it is unlikely to change the arc of the battlefield balance			2
there are other downsides , too			0
once the glass ceiling against the use of force is broken , the expectations and pressures to use it again will grow			0
there 's always the danger too of a response by @entity79 or @entity13 against @entity75 , however unlikely			2
and sooner or later , @entity28 will commit some other horror that will require another @entity4 response			0
this kind of episodic intervention without a real strategy can undermine @entity4 credibility , too			0
to be sure , there are real risks in acting on option three , and @entity10 most assuredly is a reluctant warrior			1
indeed , in view of the parliamentary opposition to @entity209 prime minister @entity208 's willingness to join the @entity4 , he may be a lonely warrior , too			0
but he 's going to war with @entity13 nonetheless			2
@entity212 's apparent use of chemical weapons , the president 's own words and those of others in his administration leave him no other choice			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222			2

@entity222 says president @entity10 seems to be *leaning* to the least bad option in @entity13
he says limited strike may be risky but less so than doing nothing or trying for regime change
@entity222 : if @entity10 does n't act after large chemical weapons attack , he *'ll* be written off as *ineffective*
