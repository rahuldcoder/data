-- just about every capital city in @entity2 seems to have been called " the @entity4 " at some point			1
unlike most other cities in the region , however , @entity5 does n't need the comparison			1
the grand old dame on the @entity10 is one of @entity2 's finest capitals by any measure			2
the eight landmark buildings below give you a feel for both @entity17 and @entity18 -- originally separate cities , divided by the river , but united about 150 years ago to form the modern metropolis			2
visit these sights in the order presented here and they form a walking tour of sorts ( see map to the left ) , albeit with the option of jumping on public transport or taking the odd taxi			0
taxis are easy to spot in their bright new yellow livery			0
take the subway and you 'll be traveling on the world 's second oldest underground railway and , on @entity38 , a @entity39			2
parliament taking 17 years to build and completed in 1902 , this neo-gothic structure was partly inspired by the @entity43 's @entity42			2
@entity43 politician - turned - broadcaster @entity44 memorably described it as " one of the most beautiful legislatures in the world , a cathedral of democracy			0
" @entity52 in front of the building is being renovated , so the best views are currently from the river ( @entity40 is right on the @entity57 ) or the opposite @entity18 banks			0
@entity40 , @entity52 1 - 3 , 1055 @entity5 ; +36 1 441 4000 more : @entity60 's signature dishes @entity62 's @entity61 taking even longer -- 50 years -- than @entity40 to complete , the biggest church in @entity5 finally opened in 1906			1
during construction the building 's dome collapsed and two of the three lead architects died			2
@entity62 's @entity61 contains the mummified hand -- called the " @entity70 " -- of @entity60 's founding king - saint , @entity71 ( @entity72 )			1
the dome is the same height as @entity40 -- current legislation forbids anything higher , so @entity5 is n't going to get its own version of @entity79 's @entity78 any time soon			1
the church is free to enter , though it costs 500 forints ( $ 2.30 ) to climb up to the observation deck surrounding the 96 - meter high dome ( closed from november to the end of march )			0
@entity62 's @entity84 , @entity72 tér 1 , 1051 @entity5 ; more on @entity86 @entity87 a lot of building rivalry has gone on in @entity5			1
the @entity91 emperor @entity90 approved ( and partially paid for ) the construction of an opera house in the city on the condition it was no bigger than the one in @entity97			1
smaller it may have been but it was far more opulent -- the emperor 's reported reaction on seeing it at the grand opening in 1884 was to mutter , " these @entity60 ! " you can visit the ornate building on a tour but , even better , see it while watching an opera or ballet performance			1
the opera house is located on @entity108 ( itself a @entity39 ) , @entity5 's grand boulevard full of high - end shops and other magnificent buildings			1
@entity91 @entity112 , @entity108 22 , 1061 @entity5 ; +36 1 814 - 7100 ; more information on performance tickets or guided tours more : 11 things to know before visiting @entity60 @entity117 also known as the @entity119 , this is one of the largest @entity121 temples in the world			2
consecrated in 1859 , the @entity125 revival - style building is a center of @entity127 , a moderate reformed branch of the religion			0
the complex also includes a museum and , in the rear courtyard , a memorial to @entity134 victims in the form of a weeping willow with the names of the dead and disappeared inscribed on the leaves			0
an estimated 565,000 @entity91 @entity121 were murdered in @entity140 from a prewar population of more than 800,000			0
@entity117 , @entity142 2 , 1074 @entity5 ; +36 1 343 0420 @entity143 @entity5 is a city of bridges , but the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) is the granddaddy of them all -- in 1849 it became the first permanent span linking @entity18 and @entity17			1
commissioned by a @entity91 count , after whom it is named , the 375 - meter - long suspension bridge was designed by an @entity152 engineer and built under the supervision of a @entity154			0
as with all @entity5 bridges , the original was blown up during the siege of the city in @entity140 -- a broadly similar replacement opened to traffic in 1947			1
the bridge is at its most spectacular at night , when fully illuminated			2
@entity143 spans the @entity10 between @entity162 on the @entity17 side and @entity164 in @entity18			2
more : @entity5 's best ' ruin bars ' @entity166 the @entity167 , yet another @entity39 ( why not just designate the whole town a @entity39 ? ) , dominates the @entity18 skyline			1
although it actually lacks a castle , the @entity166 , dominating the southern end , is magnificent			2
a royal residence from the 1300s to the end of the @entity91 monarchy in the early 20th century , it was rebuilt time and again through numerous sieges and wars			0
it now houses the @entity182 , the @entity183 and the @entity184			0
like the @entity186 , the palace looks particularly magical each evening , when floodlights are switched on			0
@entity166 , @entity188 2 , 1014 @entity5 ; +36 1 224 3700 @entity190 's @entity189 so named because the fisherman 's guild was responsible for protecting this section of the medieval defenses , this is n't a building so much as a glorified wall			1
what you see today was built between 1895 and 1902 to replace the former castle wall and designed to harmonize with neighboring @entity201			0
the bastion 's seven turrets represent the seven @entity91 tribes			0
they were n't designed to keep people out , but to provide a vantage point -- the panorama they offer over the river ( both embankments are -- you guessed it -- also a @entity39 ) is breathtaking			0
@entity190 's @entity189 , @entity214 tér 1 - 3 , 1014 @entity5 more : why misers should head for @entity5 @entity216 proof that not every @entity5 building worth seeing need be more than 100 years old , the @entity216 opened on the @entity218 , next to the @entity219 , in 2002			1
the eclectic modern design includes references to much of the city 's historic architecture but also incorporates a lot of glasswork			1
the public park in which the theater sits has a sculptured entrance gate in the form of theater curtains , statues of popular @entity91 actors in their most famous roles scattered about and a maze -- just in case you 're not tired of walking around			0
@entity237 , @entity239 park 1 , 1095 @entity5 ; +36 1 476 - 6868 @entity0 's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			1
however , @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

" @entity4 " ? @entity5 needs no such comparison
@entity5 's @entity87 may be smaller than @entity97 's -- but it 's more opulent
the city 's @entity143 and @entity166 look superb lit up at night
