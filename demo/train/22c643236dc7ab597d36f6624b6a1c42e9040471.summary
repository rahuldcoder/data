president @entity0 called sunday for a " thorough " and " rigorous " investigation into allegations involving prostitutes and secret service agents in @entity5			1
some 11 @entity4 agents and officers are being investigated over preliminary findings that they allegedly brought back several prostitutes to a hotel in @entity13 , @entity7 government sources familiar with the investigation have told @entity15			1
" what happened here in @entity5 is being investigated by the director of the @entity4 , " said @entity0 , who spoke in @entity13 , where he was in town for the @entity18 event			1
@entity4 agents sent home from @entity5 " i expect that investigation to be thorough and i expect it to be rigorous			1
if it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed , then of course i 'll be angry , " he said			1
the alleged misconduct occurred before @entity0 arrived in @entity13			1
the @entity4 personnel have since been sent back to the @entity7 and put on administrative leave , the agency said			1
the @entity7 military said that five @entity7 troops who were working with the @entity4 are also under investigation for missing curfew and alleged " misconduct " at the same @entity5 hotel			2
" we 're representing the people of the @entity7 and when we travel to another county i expect us to observe the highest standards , " said @entity0			1
" obviously what 's been reported does n't match up with those standards			0
" leaders debate @entity49 , drug war at summit still , he cautioned : " i 'll wait until the full investigation is completed until i pass final judgment			1
" none of the agents or officers being investigated was part of the president 's personal protective detail and @entity0 was not based at the @entity61 , where the alleged misconduct occurred			1
but dignitaries and journalists reporting on the hemispheric meeting were staying there , a @entity7 government official said			0
rep. @entity68 , chairman of the @entity69 , was briefed on the matter and told @entity15 on saturday that the government personnel brought prostitutes back to their rooms wednesday night and " one of the women did not leave the room in the morning			2
" a hotel manager tried to get in the room , and eventually the woman emerged and said " they owed her money , " according to @entity68			0
similarly , @entity7 government sources said there was a dispute between at least one @entity4 member and a woman brought back to his hotel over a request to be paid			0
at least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police , and complaints were filed with the @entity7 embassy , the sources said			0
" @entity97 saw that report , and they immediately began an investigation , " @entity68 said			2
@entity4 spokesman @entity100 said that the agents were relieved of duty thursday -- prior to the president 's arrival in @entity5 -- and replaced after " allegations of misconduct			0
" the agency 's assistant director , @entity107 , noted his agency 's " zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct			2
" " this incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated , professional manner , " @entity107 said saturday			2
" we regret any distraction from the @entity18 this situation has caused			1
" the @entity7 military is conducting its own investigation and will mete out " punishment , if appropriate ... in accordance with established policies and the @entity130 , " @entity124 said in a statement saturday			2
@entity132 , a former @entity133 reporter who has written a book about the @entity4 , called the incident " clearly the biggest scandal in @entity4 history			0
" the @entity133 , which was the first to report the story , said it was alerted to the investigation by @entity132			0
@entity141 -- president of the @entity142 , which represents @entity4 agents and other federal law enforcement officers -- urged caution in jumping to conclusions , characterizing the incident as " isolated " and not necessarily a scandal			0
" that 's just sort of an overdramatic interpretation of an isolated incident , " he said			0
" we have to trust the process of the internal review			0
" while soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of @entity5 , it is considered a breach of the agency 's conduct code , the government sources said			0
high - level officials in the @entity4 and the @entity164 were outraged over the incident , the sources said , noting that the investigation indicated the prostitutes were brought back to a hotel that had been secured for the summit .			1

@entity0 : " i 'll wait until the full investigation is completed until i pass final judgment "
