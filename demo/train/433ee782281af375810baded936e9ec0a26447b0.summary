@entity41 said he was told by the @entity2 administration that the issue was being examined			2
with no final answer given , @entity41 and more than 200 of his colleagues decided the executive order route was a viable one			1
" he was speaking about wanting to move on a progressive agenda , " @entity41 said			0

@entity2 has deported more people than any previous presidents , angering @entity105 -- a key @entity96 voting bloc -- who say @entity2 's deportation policy is extreme as it creates fear and heartache			1
