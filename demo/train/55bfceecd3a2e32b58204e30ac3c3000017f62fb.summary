@entity0 , @entity1 -- she reputedly never carries any bank notes , but @entity6 's @entity5 this week marked half a century since she became the first ever monarch to be depicted on one			2
sketched by artist @entity9 , the young queen first appeared in a £ 1 note in 1960 wearing a crown , earrings and a necklace , her likeness replacing images of @entity16 -- a female symbol of @entity6 used on the country 's currency for centuries			1
while her firm gaze and faint smile remain unchanged , the image of the queen has aged visibly over the decades , albeit very gracefully			0
a new image appeared in 1963 , the year she marked her 37th birthday , and again in 1970 and 1971 , the last of which survived unchanged for nearly two decades			0
the current image in circulation , showing an older queen , again wearing crown , necklace and earrings , dates from 1990			2
with the queen still officially head of state in many @entity38 countries , @entity5 also features on many bank notes worldwide -- making her image one of the most widely reproduced of all time			0
to mark the anniversary , the @entity43 's museum this week opens an exhibition of past and present banknotes featuring the queen in addition to the original pencil sketches and printing blocks used to create them .			1
