@entity27 is the lone female member of the @entity29 , a 24 - member body atop the @entity32			1
if promoted to the standing committee , @entity27 would make a crack in the political glass ceiling			1
even with the historic prospect of a woman joining the most powerful @entity9 political entity , some are skeptical of the overall progress for @entity9 women in power			1
" i think women 's participation in politics in @entity9 remains largely symbolic due to complicated social , cultural , and political factors , " said @entity43 , assistant professor of political science at the @entity45			1

" but that move alone would not necessarily lead to an improvement in the overall status of women			0
" if chosen for the committee , @entity27 will most likely take the position of the " propaganda tsar , " according to @entity81 , which is based at @entity82			1
the group described @entity27 as " liberal minded			2
" @entity9 data show that women lag in political representation			1
only 2.2 % of working women were in charge of the state offices , party organizations and other enterprises or institutions , according to the @entity94 on @entity96 's @entity95 , a national survey released last year			0
during the presentation of these survey results , officials from the @entity98 , a women 's advancement organization affiliated with the government , was asked why the @entity9 leadership lacked women			1
@entity104 , the vice-chairman of the federation said the @entity32 of @entity9 and the government places " great importance to empower women 's issues , which our @entity110 has clearly put forward the basic principle of ' gender equality			1
' " the @entity113 of @entity9 , which is sponsored by the @entity98 , declined multiple requests for comment			2

and studies find that women are outperforming men in universities , said @entity63 of @entity64			0
but their education does not translate to economic and political power			0
" you see that in the workplace , there 's a lot of systemic gender discrimination in the workplace , there 's discrimination in hiring and promotion , " @entity63 said			0
" there has also been a lot of evidence that the gender income gap has widened , especially in the very recent years			0
" statistically , women 's average annual income was 67.3 % of men 's in urban areas and 56 % in rural areas -- which reflected a decrease compared with the wage gap in 1990 , according to the 2010 national survey			0
there are exceptions as some women have achieved the pinnacle of financial success			0
