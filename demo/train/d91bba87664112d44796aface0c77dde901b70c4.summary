@entity0 -- for federal workers with security clearances , losing a house to foreclosure can cost them their jobs as well , because financial distress can be a security vulnerability , a recent study says			1
attorney @entity11 says he has several clients who face losing their jobs -- or being rejected for a new job -- because they have gotten into debt and can not pass the required background check			1
" the government needs to take into account the current financial crisis in the country , " he said			2
" not everybody who loses their house due to a mortgage or a short sale is necessarily a security risk			1
" to prove his point , @entity11 looked at the @entity27 , and counted the number of contractor employees who have been stripped of their security privileges because of debt			1
ten years ago , there was fewer than one case per year that reached the @entity35 , the study shows			2
last year , there were 24 , and the pace this year looks similar			2
employees with at least 10 other agencies face similar procedures of reviewing and revoking clearances , @entity11 says			0
" no single fact ( e.g. a foreclosure ) will necessarily result in a denial of clearance			0
conditions beyond the individual 's control can be mitigating , " said @entity46 , a spokeswoman for the government 's @entity47			0
but an inability to satisfy debts can be grounds for denying an employee a security clearance , according to the @entity27 's published guidelines			1
" an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds , " the guidelines say , " including espionage			0
" financial problems were the reason double - agent @entity66 , one of the most damaging spies in @entity69 history , started selling secrets to the @entity71 in the 1980s , according to @entity72 , the former @entity73 counter-espionage agent who helped catch him			1
@entity72 said even if the financial difficulties are not the government employee 's fault , they can make a worker vulnerable			0
" foreign agents are looking for that , " he said			0
" it 's not hard			0
you can pull the credit report on just about anybody , and you look at them and realize , wow , they are in enormous debt			1
" then , @entity72 says , a foreign agent might approach the target -- say by following the employee after work to a bar -- and offer to pay for secrets			1
he says the agent might say , " ' hey , i 've got a solution to your problems			1
just give me something little , and i 'll give you some money , and you 'll make ends meet this month			1
' " the revoking of clearances , recently highlighted by @entity102 and the @entity103 , could be costing the country valuable employees			0
as an example , @entity11 cited a client , whom he declined to name , who may lose her security clearance because of foreclosure			2
" she 's a highly - trained person , " he said			0
" and she 'd be difficult to replace			0
so not only are people losing their jobs , the government is losing the services of good people they need			2
" @entity120 , the former homeland security adviser under president @entity121 , says when officials discover vulnerable employees , " the first order of business is always to try and save that person 's clearance , and therefore job			2
but i can see now , during this period , where this is probably a much more serious concern for investigators			0

some are being turned down for new jobs over debt
others have been stripped of their security privileges
