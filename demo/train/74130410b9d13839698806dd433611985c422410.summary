-- if the @entity2 election race conjures up images of mud flying through the air for many @entity6 , campaigning politicians in the @entity6 evoke visions of a more white - gloved affair			1
@entity6 's politics are as machiavellian as anyone else 's behind closed doors , but their public campaigns are demure compared to the @entity2 -- and many in @entity15 are aghast at the negative campaign tactics used on the road to the @entity18			1
@entity6 has plenty on its mind these days			2
the country is wrangling with questions about how to rebuild its tsunami - devastated coast , what to do with its idled nuclear reactors , and whether a tax hike will solve its economic woes , so it 's no surprise if people in @entity15 are n't riveted to the lead - up to the @entity2 elections			1
but the @entity2 is important to @entity6 's economy and to @entity6 's increasingly rocky relationship with @entity36 , so people are not ignoring it completely -- even if @entity2 politics falls somewhere below the ' retirement ' of a young pop idol in the morning shows ' news order			1
for those not up on their @entity6 pop , @entity44 's surprise announcement that she was leaving mega-pop idol group @entity45 in march got as much breathless coverage in @entity15 , maybe more , than @entity50 garnered in the @entity2 press for his decision to exit stage right of the 2012 @entity55 primaries			1
in the 2008 @entity58 primaries , @entity6 observers saw @entity59 as a powerful and intriguing former first lady , but it was @entity63 's historic run that got even more attention when a small coastal city that happened to bear his name formed the " @entity63 for @entity63 " support group			1
@entity6 watched the group cheer as the @entity70 election results came in 2008			1
they still make sweet steamed bean buns , called manju , with @entity63 's picture on them and have announced plans to erect a statue of him in town			2
the idea that whoever won the 2008 @entity58 nomination would make history was exciting for the @entity6			1
this time around , most people see the current field of @entity55 hopefuls as a noisy blur , an only - in - @entity2 phenomenon -- or a " matsuri , " as one woman described it , in reference to @entity6 's colorful , oft - chaotic outdoor festivals			1
the notion that @entity2 campaigning is a complicated " show " was mentioned repeatedly by the people i spoke to , and @entity98 is filled with @entity6 observers likening @entity2 politics to " watching a movie "			1
one thing that adds to the unreality of it is the issues at play			0
while there are right - wing parties in @entity6 , their focus tends to be a noisy brand of nationalism , rather than the emphasis on religious values embraced by @entity55 candidates like @entity115 and @entity50			2
the major newspapers have recently carried election primers on the role of @entity119 and evangelical christianity in the election			0
one such piece asked : " what is this ' evangelical christianity ' we hear about in the @entity2 elections ? " religion simply is n't as loud a voice in @entity6 politics as it is in the @entity2 election race			1

rules dating back to the 1950s heavily restrict how @entity6 politicians can campaign			2
these laws prevent candidates from taking to @entity98 or updating their websites during the 12 - day campaign period			0
in that short time , white - gloved candidates drive around waving from their campaign cars , repeating their names and asking for votes over loudspeakers attached to the car roofs			0
@entity6 candidates park their cars at intersections with heavy foot traffic and make speeches with microphones plugged into portable amps in front of some of the busiest train stations in the world			2
while small crowds do gather , people generally tolerate the racket only grudgingly			0
when a @entity169 man was arrested last spring for grabbing a microphone from a candidate in front of a train station in a @entity15 suburb and shouting , " @entity6 elections are too noisy , " he found an outpouring of support online from @entity6 people who were also quietly fed up with the racket			2
many @entity6 are intrigued by the idea of the @entity2 candidates ' debates			1
the handyman in my @entity15 flat complex told me the debates are the reason that he thinks the @entity2 election process is " better than @entity6 's			1
" " the debates are on tv , right ? that gives everyone a chance to listen to the candidates , understand what they believe , and then make up their minds , " he said			0
" we do n't have anything like that , so we do n't know as much about who the candidates actually are before we vote			0
" those who watch the elections more closely view the debates and the hoopla around them more warily			0
one @entity6 student told me : " what 's good about the ' show ' side of the debates is that it gets more people to watch			2
but ultimately you do n't know if you 're getting the candidate 's own views or just hearing what his team of strategists came up with			0
it 's easy for people to be manipulated by the politicians and the people behind them			0
" many @entity6 people say that they do n't fully understand the @entity2 election system , and i am quick to reassure them that many of us @entity2 would n't want to be tested on it , either			1
but they have the sense that the @entity2 elections are more direct , and that the @entity2 is therefore a more representative democracy			2

there are no primaries ; party leaders choose candidates			0
since the campaign season is so short , they often look for candidates who will have good name recognition			0
this is why the less - powerful @entity241 often hosts a cast of minor celebrities including tv anchors , talk show commentators -- and even a handful of pro-wrestlers			0
the most colorful of these was @entity248 , who did n't shy from mentioning his signature " thunder fire powerbomb " move in the @entity251			0
the need for name recognition is one reason why political seats are seemingly passed down within families			0
the handyman explained , " when a politician 's son or daughter runs for office , we say , ' oh , that 's so - and - so 's kid , he 'll do , ' without giving it too much more thought			0
" he 's clearly not the only one who thinks this way -- a study in 2009 found that a quarter of @entity251 members and almost half of the @entity274 legislators at the time were the children of former politicians			0
even if the @entity2 election itself seems inscrutable to @entity6 voters , the result -- a leader who is in office for at least four years -- looks good			1
@entity6 has had four prime ministers since @entity63 won the 2008 election , and the margin for error is thin			1
the @entity288 student says , " fixed terms in the @entity2 mean that even a sloppy start can be redeemed , but in @entity6 , they dissolve the @entity251 easily , so they ca n't recover from mistakes			1
" as @entity6 slowly rebuilds after the earthquake , calls are growing for a system with a stronger , more directly elected leader and a more efficient system of government			0
@entity6 will be looking at what parts of the @entity2 system it might want to draw from and what it could improve			1
and until then , @entity15 will be looking up from its smartphones once in awhile at the @entity2 political matsuri .			0

while @entity6 campaigns are more civilized , the @entity6 enjoy the more boisterous @entity2 election race
the @entity6 city of @entity63 formed the " @entity63 for @entity63 " group in 2008
religion is n't as loud a voice in @entity6 politics as it is in @entity2 , reports @entity314
