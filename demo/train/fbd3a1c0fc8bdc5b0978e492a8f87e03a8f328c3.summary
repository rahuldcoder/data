-- these days , it seems , it 's not enough for a digital device to just play games			0
to keep up with the smartphones and tablet computers of the world , any game system needs to at least nod in the direction of cloud - based and social networking " apps " that are all the rage with the kiddies			0
@entity15 's @entity14 has now done exactly that , launching free downloadable @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity21 apps in conjunction with the system 's official debut wednesday ( though pre-orderers have had the system for a week now )			1
your very first encounter with two of these apps foreshadows the occasionally awkward experience to come			0
when you first load up @entity19 or @entity21 on your @entity14 , you 're asked to click a button that opens up a web browser where you can log in to the service			1
then you 're expected to write down a confirmation code and navigate back to the original app to confirm your credentials			0
it 's a minor , one - time annoyance , but it makes the @entity17 app 's integrated login prompt seem futuristic by comparison			2
@entity43 : hands - on with the new @entity14 @entity17 @entity17 is probably the most useful of the apps in the @entity14 's initial batch			1
even if you already have the streaming video service on a host of other devices ( and you probably do ) , the @entity14 's large , crisp screen provides a pleasant portable viewing experience without being quite as large or cumbersome as an @entity53 or laptop ( not to mention an hdtv )			2
the @entity14 's 960 x 544 resolution is n't quite " hd , " but high - definition content still looks pretty good , provided you have the bandwidth to view it ( warning to @entity61 users : @entity17 will eat up your data allowance incredibly quickly )			1
this is the only @entity14 app so far that makes use of the system 's face buttons as well as the touch screen , letting you fast forward and rewind with the analog stick or pause with the x button			2
you can also use the touch screen to flick through a timeline of screengrabs from the video , which is quite pleasant			0
my only real complaint about the interface is the odd inability to scroll through the front page of recommendations with quick flicks -- instead you have to awkwardly tap on - screen buttons to move up and down the rows			2
twitter the @entity14 's @entity19 app , dubbed @entity90 , provides all the basic functionality you 'd expect from the service and then some			1
it 's easy to scroll through your timeline , @ replies or direct messages with responsive flick scrolling and a familiar pull - down - to - refresh option			0
you can easily search through tweets by keyword or hashtag and even view a series of @ replies through a handy conversation view			1
writing tweets is relatively painless using the @entity14 's big on - screen keyboard , though i found myself often missing the space bar when i was typing quickly			1
but @entity90 is somewhat annoying to use if you , like me , primarily use @entity19 as a way to scan for interesting links posted by interesting friends			0
clicking a link from @entity90 loads up the @entity14 's somewhat limited web browser , which takes a few seconds to warm up and then load the page			0
once you come back to @entity90 , the app has often lost your place in browsing the tweetstream , which means you have to wait a few seconds for everything to load again and then waste time scrolling to find your place			0
it 's also hard to imagine where @entity19 for the @entity14 is going to find its niche			1
if you 're on the computer , you likely have a better @entity19 app just a click away			0
if you 're away from the computer , you 're more likely to have a @entity19 - capable smartphone that 's handier to carry around than the massive @entity14 , which easily dominates any pocket it fits in			1
still , if you need to tell the world about your @entity132 high score right now , you 're only a few taps away from doing so on the @entity14			0
@entity21 @entity21 rounds out the @entity14 's initial round of apps , with quite possibly the nicest interface of the bunch			1
rows of easy - to - scroll - through thumbnail images provide quick access to you photostream , favorites , contacts , saved searches and even suggestions for interesting @entity21 members to browse through			1
there 's also a nice batch upload option that does n't even require leaving the main menu , though why you 'd want to upload many photos from the @entity14 's low - quality camera is a mystery ( the service might be more useful for uploading screenshots , though , which i did while composing writing this very piece )			1
it only takes a couple of taps to go from a tiny thumbnail to a beautiful , full - screen image that you can easily pan and zoom around with the multitouch screen			0
it is somewhat annoying , though , that you can only view caption and tag information when the image is an unzoomed , compact square on the right side of the screen -- some sort of transparent overlay option would have been nice			0
it 's also a bit odd that there 's no option to download photos to your @entity14 to use as home screen wallpapers , though you can use the @entity14 's screenshot function to approximate this feature			2
so far , the @entity14 's nongaming apps feel more like nice extras than crucial selling points for the system			1
they work better as a proof - of - concept for the potential nongaming uses of the @entity14 's excellent touchscreen than as tools you 're likely to fully integrate into your digital life			2
here 's hoping @entity15 relaxes its tight hold on the @entity196 marketplace to let more app makers play around with the system 's potential outside of games			0

the @entity14 is primarily a gaming device but also runs apps for @entity17 , @entity19 and other services
the @entity14 screen 's resolution is n't quite " hd , " but high - definition content still looks good
you can easily search through tweets with a handy conversation view
@entity21 has a nice interface with quick access to photostream , favorites and contacts
