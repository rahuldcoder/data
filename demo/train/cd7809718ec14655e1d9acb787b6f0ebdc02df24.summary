@entity0 -- the world 's most valuable company is going head - to - head against a financially ailing @entity6 electronics company over the right to use the @entity9 name in the vast market of @entity6 -- and the tech giant lost round one			1
round two is scheduled wednesday as the @entity13 is expected to hear an appeal of a lower court decision in favor of @entity17 , a company which trademarked the @entity9 name in @entity6 in 2000 -- 10 years before @entity18 's @entity9 hit global stores			1
stores in @entity21 and @entity22 were ordered to stop sales of @entity9 by local authorities after a december 5 ruling in a @entity27 court against @entity18			1
meanwhile , legal actions have been filed in @entity29 , @entity0 and in @entity30 by @entity17 to block @entity18 from using the @entity9 name			1
what 's the dispute about ? the two companies are mired in an ever bitter battle here -- with both claiming the @entity9 name is legally theirs			0
@entity18 says it bought the name from the struggling @entity38 electronics firm in 10 different countries			0
@entity17 contends it did not sell the rights to the name in @entity6			1
" @entity17 wants to get @entity18 's full attention , " said @entity42 , attorney for @entity17			2
" if @entity18 does n't change the name , it will violate the law here			0
@entity18 might be punished by @entity6 courts or forbidden from selling the @entity9 3 in @entity6			1
" in a statement to @entity1 , @entity18 says , " we bought @entity17 's worldwide rights to the @entity9 trademark in 10 different countries several years ago			1
@entity17 refuses to honor their agreement with @entity18 in @entity6 and a @entity0 court has sided with @entity18 in this matter			1
our case is still pending in mainland @entity6			2
" as @entity18 is likely to unveil in march the @entity9 3 -- the latest edition of the popular computer tablet -- the case is generating a hailstorm of international attention , and @entity17 has threatened legal action to block the export and import of the computer tablets -- a move that would disrupt the global supply chain for the tech giant , which depends on @entity6 suppliers like @entity67			1
who sold what to whom ? the case centers around @entity71 , the @entity0 - listed maker of computer monitors and other devices			0
a subsidiary , @entity75 , sold @entity18 the rights to use the @entity9 name , which the @entity6 company had trademarked in @entity6 and in markets around the world			1
but @entity17 -- which was seized by creditors in 2009 after defaulting on hundreds of millions of loans -- said it did n't know it was selling the rights to @entity18			1
moreover -- and this is the key point on which the legal dispute rests -- @entity75 did n't own the rights to the @entity9 trademark in @entity6 ; another subsidiary , @entity88 , did			1
@entity17 says @entity18 did n't negotiate in good faith - using a shell company that promised not to make competing products under the @entity9 label			1
the company alleges the negotiator concealed he was working for @entity18 , gave a false name , and said the company he represented was @entity98 -- or @entity9 for short			2
how @entity18 snookered @entity17 to get @entity9 trademark " using shell companies is not uncommon but usually the conduct is honest , " @entity42 said			1
" @entity17 was cheated by @entity18			2
" had @entity17 executives known they were dealing with @entity18 , they likely would have asked for more cash , says @entity105 , head of the intellectual property practice and partner at @entity0 law firm @entity108			2
" it seems that @entity17 realized somehow too late who they were dealing with and they felt they were tricked or cheated , so that 's why they tried to find loopholes in the contract , " @entity105 said			0
" and they found a very credible one , according to @entity6 law			0
" is this about intellectual property rights ? the fact that @entity18 is engaged in a large - scale lawsuit over property rights with a @entity6 company in @entity6 seems , to many observers , odd			1
after all , sales of counterfeit movies happen out in the open in @entity6			0
even fake @entity18 and @entity132 stores were discovered in @entity6 last year			1
" i think it 's going to increase the awareness of the value of intellectual property , " technology analyst @entity133 told @entity1			0
" it 's ironic that @entity18 is being sued by a @entity6 company where typically it 's the other way around			2
" but @entity105 disputes the perception that there is a greater propensity to sell counterfeit goods in @entity6			0
" you can see fake goods in @entity146 , you can see them on @entity147 in @entity148 , " he said			0
" there is a perception in @entity6 there is very weak enforcement , which to some extent is true , because @entity6 is such a big country			0
" while the @entity6 - @entity17 dispute centers on a trademark deal , the current legal wrangling is ultimately a contract dispute , @entity105 said			2
what 's next ? the hearing on the case is scheduled to begin wednesday , but any final ruling is likely to be weeks or months away			0
if @entity18 loses its appeal , it could take it to the @entity164 -- but that would be a long - shot , @entity105 said			0
" the court hears less than 1 % of cases put before them , " he said			0
@entity18 could throw up its hands and decide to rename the tablet in @entity6 , but @entity17 could still sue for damages on past use of its trademarked name , @entity105 said			1
but @entity18 dropping @entity9 name also could be bad for @entity17 -- or , more exactly , @entity17 's creditors			1
" as @entity88 's financial position is dire , its eight creditor banks view the @entity9 registrations to be its most valuable asset and would want to see it fetch a ' fair ' value , " @entity105 wrote in a recent note to clients			0
" it is claimed that a settlement ( with @entity18 ) will require the bank creditor 's approval			0
" in @entity6 , netizens are asking could @entity18 's popular tablet computer soon be known as the @entity186 or @entity187 here			2
but consumers in @entity6 say they 'll take the @entity18 product - no matter what it 's called			2
" i do n't care how they play with the four letters , " one @entity6 customer told @entity1			0
@entity1 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0

@entity18 is *embroiled* in a lawsuit over use of the @entity9 name in @entity6
@entity17 claims it never sold @entity18 the rights to use the name in the mainland
a lower court sided with @entity17 , and led to some @entity6 stores pulling @entity9
case is now going before an appeals court in @entity210
