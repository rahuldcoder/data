@entity0 -- crews resumed spraying water at the quake - damaged @entity5 nuclear facility early monday , @entity7 reported , one day after the @entity9 government slapped restrictions on some food produced around the plant			1
workers have begun to see some success in their battle to cool down the reactors , but @entity9 officials said they may need to release additional radioactive gas into the air			1
the plant 's owner , @entity22 , said electricity was being supplied to a switchboard in reactor no. 2			1
but officials said they were monitoring reactor no. 3 to determine whether to release gas to reduce mounting pressure in the containment vessel -- the steel and concrete shell that insulates radioactive material inside			2
power company officials said pressure was higher than previous readings -- but stable -- sunday afternoon			1
and chief cabinet secretary @entity35 said the pressure increase did not require " an immediate release of the air at this moment			0
" still , " even in the best scenario , there will be a lot of bumps ahead , " @entity35 told reporters as he assessed the situation at the plant in a briefing sunday			2
there are six reactors at the nuclear plant , where workers have been struggling to stave off a full meltdown since a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami knocked out cooling systems			2
workers have injected steam to release pressure in previous operations			0
the dual disasters , which struck march 11 , devastated much of northeastern @entity9			1
on monday , the country 's national police said 8,649 people were confirmed dead , 2,702 were injured and 12,877 remained missing as search efforts continued			0
in @entity67 alone -- one of the hardest - hit areas -- police said the death toll could climb to 15,000			0
amidst the gloom came a ray of hope sunday when medical officials in the @entity67 city of @entity74 said they had rescued an 80 - year - old grandmother and her 16 - year - old grandson , who had been trapped inside their house for nine days			0
police were searching for survivors in the vicinity , @entity81 , in the southern part of @entity74 near the coast			0
the boy managed to crawl through the rubble onto the roof , the @entity74 police department said			0
a relative had reported the two missing on march 13 , police said			0
in @entity5 , authorities have evacuated about 200,000 people from a 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) area surrounding the plant , but the crisis there has sparked concern across the country			1
very small amounts -- far below the level of concern -- of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water in @entity0 and most prefectures near the @entity5 plant			1
the health ministry said levels of radioactive iodine three times greater than the regulated standard were found in drinking water in a village near the @entity5 plant and asked residents not to drink from the tap , @entity7 reported sunday			1
the @entity9 government has banned the sale of raw milk from @entity119 , where the @entity5 plant is located , and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring @entity123 after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards , the country 's @entity114 reported			1
and officials in @entity5 halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture			1
@entity35 said the contaminated milk detected in @entity5 prefecture had not been distributed or sold			1
on saturday , officials said tainted milk was found 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) from the plant , and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers ( 65 miles ) to the south , almost halfway to @entity0			1
a person who consumed the tainted food continuously for a year would take in the same amount of radiation as a single ct scan , @entity35 said saturday			0
that 's about 7 millisieverts , or double what an average person in an industrialized country is exposed to in a year , according to the @entity147			0
" even if you consume the spinach in question for a long time , it will not pose an immediate threat to your health , " @entity35 said sunday			0
six members of an emergency crew working to restore electricity at the plant have been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation per hour			1
officials say regaining electrical power could bring cooling systems back online -- a key step in curbing the further emission of radioactive material and preventing a full nuclear meltdown			2
a meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods get so hot that they melt the steel and concrete structure containing them , spilling out into the air and water with potentially deadly results			2
the earthquake and tsunami knocked out regular and backup cooling systems at the plant			2
it was unclear whether the cooling system in reactor no. 2 was working after power was restored sunday			1
the plan is to get power up and running for the @entity184 1 , 3 and 4 reactors soon			0
cooling systems at the @entity184 and 6 reactors -- the least troublesome of the group -- have already been restored , @entity7 said			1
on saturday , authorities set up a new system to spray sea water continuously on the troubled reactors for extended periods of time			0
previously , firefighters , soldiers and electric company workers had manually done the same in brief intervals to avoid prolonged radiation exposure			0
@entity201 was directed at the no. 3 reactor 's spent fuel pool on saturday in order to cool it and prevent the emission of more radioactive material into the atmosphere			0
authorities have also started spraying the no. 4 reactor and continued efforts there sunday			2
@entity1 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0

new : crews resume spraying the damaged plant with water , @entity7 reports
@entity9 bans the sale of raw milk and restricts vegetable sales from @entity5 prefecture
