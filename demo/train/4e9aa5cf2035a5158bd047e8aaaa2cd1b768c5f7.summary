on @entity1 's " @entity3 , " @entity1 host and chief national correspondent @entity0 goes outside the @entity4 to report on the issues affecting communities across the country			0
@entity0 recently traveled to @entity8 , to explore the debate over how to control illegal immigration			2
a fence separates the @entity12 from @entity13 in the @entity12 @entity15 's @entity14 in @entity16 , @entity8			1
@entity16 , @entity8 ( @entity1 ) -- the @entity14 desert is below : @entity16 , @entity8 , to one side and @entity16 , @entity13 , to the other			2
on this clear day , the @entity20 is glistening , birds playfully circling over what any map defines as the @entity12 - @entity13 border in this area			1
but from a helicopter above , the border is a steel barrier that stands out along the riverbank and against the desert sands , and is the dividing line that gets the most attention from those crying to cross illegally and those who believe recent efforts to bolster @entity12 border security have been riddled with wrong choices			1
just this past week , eight democrats in @entity39 wrote president @entity40 urging him to halt any further construction of the fence , one of the many border - and immigration - related political debates that have carried over from the @entity47 administration			1
to the @entity15 agents stationed in @entity14 , there is no debate			1
to them , the fence is a success story			2
from a @entity57 - vintage @entity56 helicopter , pilot @entity54 points across the border to @entity13 's @entity59 and then to the barriers that help stop illegal immigrants from making a sprint into southern @entity8			1
" you can see the triple - layer fencing , " @entity54 tells us as he lowers the helicopter and hovers over what was once a major crossing point for illegal immigrants and drug smugglers			1
" steel fence right on the border , the pedestrian fence about 90 feet north of that , and then the chain - link fence with the barbed wire			1
" the fence has three layers in areas where there is an urban neighborhood on the @entity13 side			2
@entity54 is among those who say their flights are less hectic now because while you can still clearly see the trails in the sand and in some hilly areas below , there is considerably less traffic			0
" i 've flown before and come back and had 70 - plus [ illegal immigrants logged in a tracking book ] , " @entity54 said			1
" i know guys who have gone on a flight and come back with 100 - plus illegals in their logbook			2
now it is in single digits , typically			0
" it is a fascinating view from above : old trails in some places , and the remnants of newly placed white sandbags in others			0
" it forms a pretty good bridge for them to drive across			0
" @entity54 says of the sandbags			0
when they are spotted from above , @entity15 agents on the ground are called in to destroy the makeshift crossings			1
@entity39 in 2006 -- with then - sen. @entity40 's support -- authorized nearly $ 3 billion for 670 miles of fencing stretching from @entity111 to @entity112			1
there are more lights , sensors and cameras , and there are also more agents like @entity119 driving patrols and chasing tips called in from colleagues monitoring the camera feeds at the @entity125 headquarters			2
standing alongside the steel barrier at a point in which there is just one layer of fencing , @entity119 shakes his head when told that some in @entity133 want to stop additional construction in other areas			2
" this used to be a very high - trafficked area , and now it is not , " @entity119 told us			0
asked to define " high traffic , " @entity119 says , " in the @entity14 , we would get about 800 a day			0
now , 25 maybe , or 10			0
" nodding toward the barrier , he continued : " numbers do n't lie			0
we did n't have it three years ago , and we were getting massive numbers of illegal entries			0
we have it now , and we do n't			0
" but there are voices on both extremes of the immigration debate that say the role of the fence is exaggerated , or that say the barrier 's benefit in slowing illegal traffic is offset by other costs			1
@entity159 sheriff @entity158 , whose tough stance against illegal immigrants has earned him global media coverage , says the fence is fine , but : " we just arrested 150 in the past 14 days			1
" and father @entity166 , a roman catholic priest whose @entity167 are packed with illegal immigrants , blames the fence for more risky crossings in less - populated desert areas			1
" we know that the way enforcement has gone has driven many people into the desert and caused more deaths			0
if we could only get together and work for comprehensive immigration reform			0

eight democrats in @entity39 wrote @entity40 to halt building of border fence
@entity15 agents say fence has *drastically* cut number of border crossings
then - sen. @entity40 voted to authorize almost $ 3 billion for building 670 miles of fence
*critic* says barrier has forced illegal immigrants to make riskier desert crossings
