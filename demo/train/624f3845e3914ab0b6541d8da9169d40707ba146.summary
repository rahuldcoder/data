in 1925 , @entity0 wrote an impassioned plea : " @entity2 has not only failed in its promises but actually created additional serious and disturbing social problems throughout society			1
there is not less drunkenness in the @entity8 but more			0
there is not less crime , but more			0
... the cost of government is not smaller , but vastly greater			0
respect for law has not increased , but diminished			0
" this week marks the 79th anniversary of the repeal of @entity2 in december 1933 , but @entity0 's plea could easily apply to today 's global policy on drugs			1
we could learn a thing or two by looking at what prohibition brought to the @entity23 : an increase in consumption of hard liquor , organized crime taking over legal production and distribution and widespread anger with the federal government			2
news : pot smokers enter legal limbo in @entity35 , @entity36 here we are , four decades after @entity37 declared the war on drugs in 1971 and $ 1 trillion spent since then			2
what do we have to show for it ? the @entity23 has the largest prison population in the world , with about 2.3 million behind bars			1
more than half a million of those people are incarcerated for a drug law violation			0
what a waste of young lives			0
in business , if one of our companies is failing , we take steps to identify and solve the problem			2
what we do n't do is continue failing strategies that cost huge sums of money and exacerbate the problem			1
rather than continuing on the disastrous path of the war on drugs , we need to look at what works and what does n't in terms of real evidence and data			1
opinion : the end of the war on marijuana the facts are overwhelming			0
if the global drug trade were a country , it would have one of the top 20 economies in the world			2
in 2005 , the @entity77 estimated the global illegal drug trade is worth more than $ 320 billion			0
it also estimates there are 230 million illegal drug users in the world , yet 90 % of them are not classified as problematic			2
in the @entity23 , if illegal drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco , they would yield $ 46.7 billion in tax revenue			1
a @entity91 study says legalizing drugs would save the @entity23 about $ 41 billion a year in enforcing the drug laws			1
have @entity23 drug laws reduced drug use ? no. the @entity23 is the no. 1 nation in the world in illegal drug use			1
as with @entity2 , banning alcohol did n't stop people drinking -- it just stopped people obeying the law			1
news : marijuana advocates hope to rise from ' prohibition ' about 40,000 people were in @entity23 jails and prisons for drug crimes in 1980 , compared with more than 500,000 today			1
excessively long prison sentences and locking up people for small drug offenses contribute greatly to this ballooning of the prison population			0
it also represents racial discrimination and targeting disguised as drug policy			0
people of color are no more likely to use or sell illegal drugs than white people -- yet from 1980 to 2007 , blacks were arrested for drug law violations at rates 2.8 to 5.5 times higher than white arrest rates			1
@entity2 failed when the @entity23 people spoke up and demanded its repeal			1
today , the @entity23 people are showing their dissatisfaction with the war on drugs by voting for change , often in the face of federal law			1
@entity36 and @entity35 recently became the first @entity23 states to legalize recreational use of marijuana			2
eighteen states and the @entity137 allow the medical use of marijuana , and 74 % of @entity23 support alternatives to locking people up for marijuana possession			1
how would our society , our communities and daily lives improve if we took the money we use running a police and prison state and put it into education and health ? treating drugs as a health issue could save billions , improve public health and help us better control violence and crime in our communities			1
hundreds of thousands of people have died from overdoses and drug - related diseases , including @entity160 and hepatitis c , because they did n't have access to cost - effective , life - saving solutions			2
a @entity166 study says it costs the @entity23 an average of $ 30,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate , but the nation spends only an average $ 11,665 per public school student			2
the future of our nations and our children should be our priority			0
we should be helping people addicted to drugs break their habits rather than putting users in prison			0
when it comes to drugs , we should focus on the goals we agree on : protecting our kids , protecting public safety and preventing and treating drug abuse and addiction			1
to help unlock barriers to drug reform , last june , i joined the @entity190 , which is bringing global leadership to drug reform to make fact - based research public and draw attention to successful alternative approaches			0
opinion : mr. president , fix our broken drug policy as part of this work , a new documentary , " @entity209 , " narrated by @entity204 - winning actor @entity203 and produced by my son @entity205 's indie @entity207 , followed the commission 's attempts to break the political taboo over the war on drugs			1
the film exposes the biggest failure of global policy in the past 40 years and features revealing contributions from global leaders , including former presidents @entity220 and @entity221			0
it is time we broke the taboo and opened up the debate about the war on drugs			0
we need alternatives that focus on education , health , taxation and regulation			1
if you ignore a serious problem , refuse to debate it and hope it will go away all by itself , you are very naive			0
the war on drugs has failed			2
it 's time to confront the issue head on			0
follow @ @entity239 on twitter			0

@entity242 : @entity2 caused damage in the same way the war on drugs has done
@entity205 says if one of his companies is failing , he does n't continue with failed strategies
@entity23 has the most prisoners in the world , he says , 500,000 of them for drug violations
@entity256 : we need alternatives to jail that focus on education , health , taxation , regulation
