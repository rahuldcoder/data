-- with the retirement of justice @entity3 , the @entity1 loses a judge with an unusual ability to get the big things right by getting the little things right			1
@entity3 will be remembered for his stirring opinions in cases of great national significance			1
he also should be remembered for his equally compelling commitment to justice in scores of other decisions that received little public notice			0
in @entity16 in 2006 , @entity3 wrote the majority opinion holding that even in the face of real threats of terror , the president must follow the law			1
the court declared that the @entity24 reached into a military detention facility in @entity26 , @entity27 , and offered the protection of the rule of law to the man who served as the driver for @entity32			1
for @entity3 , no person was above the law , and no person was below the law			1
@entity3 ' passion for this ideal drew support from his experience as a clerk to @entity1 @entity42			1
in 1946 , the @entity1 upheld the summary trial and the death sentence meted out by an @entity46 military tribunal to accused @entity49 war criminal @entity47			0
dissenting , @entity42 affirmed the importance of providing " due process of law " to all people , " whether citizens , aliens , alien enemies or enemy belligerents			2
" in @entity58 , @entity3 finally vindicated that principle 60 years later			1
for @entity3 , that dedication to ensuring justice in all cases constituted the defining characteristic of a judge			1
in the 2000 presidential election decision , @entity64 , @entity3 penned a stinging dissent , castigating the majority for undermining the " @entity69 's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law			1
" @entity3 ' commitment to the rule of law transcended partisan boundaries			1
in 1997 , he spoke for the @entity1 in @entity76 , finding that the @entity24 did not shield president @entity77 with immunity from civil suits			0
first appointed to the bench by president @entity81 and then elevated to the high court by president @entity83 , @entity3 was a @entity84 from a different era			1
his rulings fell out of favor with the ideology of that party			0
however , @entity3 always remained a small - r republican			1
he detested the idea of a monarch who stood outside of the law			2
he often cited the @entity95 maxim , " @entity102 can do no wrong , " to emphasize the foreignness of that concept of immunity in our republican form of government			0
cases involving presidents are important , but rare			2
@entity3 insisted on promoting the rule of law in all cases			1
when i think about @entity3 , i think not only of @entity109 and @entity110 , of @entity77 and @entity111 , but also of @entity112 and @entity113			2
it is a bedrock principle of the @entity46 legal system that lack of wealth should not translate into a denial of justice			0
accordingly , courts do not charge filing fees to those who can not afford to pay			2
in the early 1990s , however , the @entity1 deviated from that practice by barring access to people it deemed frequent filers of frivolous actions			0
the court refused to waive the fees for these litigants despite their poverty			0
when the court invoked the rule to bar access to one @entity112 , @entity3 dissented			1
his opinion criticized the court for undermining its commitment to offering " equal access to justice for both the rich and the poor			0
" the court continues to invoke the rule up to this day , and @entity3 continues to dissent			1
and then there is the tragic case of @entity113			0
the @entity46 government hired @entity113 , a professional diver , to inspect a dam on the @entity149			0
government employees assured @entity151 that the water flow system would be shut off , but it was not			0
@entity113 's head was pulled into an opening in the system , and he was killed			0
the government denied all liability , citing language in a @entity1 case interpreting an obscure provision of a 1928 statute			0
@entity3 wrote separately to decry this result , imploring @entity164 to remedy the situation			2
he declared that " this obsolete legislative remnant is nothing more than an engine of injustice			0
" in his lexicon , there was no stronger rebuke			0
the rule of law requires standing up to presidents , but it also demands standing up for the notorious and the nameless , the @entity175 and the @entity176 , the @entity177 and the @entity178			1
when one develops a habit of promoting justice in the obscure cases , the courage to demand justice in the notable cases follows			0
@entity3 pursued justice in all cases , great and small			2
the rule of law has lost an important champion on our nation 's highest court			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity3 stood firmly for the rule of law , his former law clerk says
@entity193 says @entity3 held presidents to account , said they were not above the law
@entity3 believed everyone , regardless of means , should have access to courts , he says
@entity193 : the law requires standing up to presidents and standing up for the nameless
