-- @entity1 dashed @entity3 's hopes of delivering a home victory for @entity5 at @entity6 with another commanding drive to win the @entity9 @entity8 sunday			1
the three - time defending champion secured his sixth win of the season after starting on pole position , relegating @entity14 's @entity3 to second place			1
@entity1 's @entity17 teammate @entity16 finished third ahead of the second @entity5 of @entity20 @entity19			1
the victory extended @entity1 's advantage in the world title race over @entity3 to 53 points with seven rounds remaining			1
@entity27 's @entity26 , who was forced to start from 12th after a poor qualifying session saturday , could only manage ninth spot , but remained in third place in the standings , 81 points adrift			0
@entity1 's only significant problem was self imposed as he flat spotted his front right tire after breaking too sharply into the first corner of the race			2
under pressure from @entity19 , the 26 - year - old @entity38 was desperate to hold on to his lead after the traditional flat out start at @entity6			1
two time champion @entity3 , back in fifth on the grid after his difficulties in qualifying , quickly worked his way up to third before @entity19 gave way to him under team orders			1
@entity1 was able to nurse his tires until the first and only round of pit stops for the leading contenders without coming under serious challenge			2
@entity3 was briefly challenged by @entity16 until the @entity53 was ordered to back off because of gear selection problems , which were also problematic for the leader @entity1			1
but he took the checkered flag 5.4 seconds clear of @entity3 to take an even firmer grip on the championship he has dominated for the past four seasons			2
@entity1 was only too aware that his victory was unlikely to be welcomed by the tifosi diehards who had flocked to the circuit in northern @entity9 to support their beloved @entity5			1
" it was a fantastic race , but you can hear the difference when you do n't win here in a red suit , " @entity1 said			2
" but this means you have done well and beaten the red men ! " the race was terrific for both of us as we had problems with the gearboxes at the end , but i was ok because i had a good cushion			0
it is a fantastic win			0
" @entity3 acknowledged there was little he could do to prevent the 32nd victory of @entity1 's career			1
" second place is good and to have this podium ceremony which is the most spectacular podium of the year , " he said			0
" hopefully we 'll come back next year and have first place			0
every time i am here this podium and this experience is more and more special			2
" outside the front runners , @entity38 's @entity86 underlined his reputation as one of the most promising young drivers on the grid with an excellent fifth place in the uncompetitive @entity93			0
his compatriot @entity94 finished sixth for @entity95 ahead of @entity53 @entity96 of @entity97 , who will replace @entity16 at @entity17 next season			1
@entity99 of @entity100 held off the fast - charging @entity26 for eighth , while @entity27 's @entity102 earned a single point for @entity104 , who were celebrating their 50th anniversary as an @entity108 team			0
@entity26 , who had to contend with a slow puncture which meant an extra pit stop , conceded his title hopes were over			0
" it 's awful when you are just empty of energy and have given everything for just two points -- and that 's it for the championship now , " he told @entity112			0
the @entity108 circuit will now depart @entity121 for the next round under the lights on the spectacular street circuit in @entity125 with @entity1 in prime position for a fourth straight title .			0
