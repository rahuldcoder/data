@entity0 , @entity1 -- the young man , his body glistening with black oil and sweat , poured more oil onto the fire			1
the flames roared , heating two barrels of oil to explosive temperatures			2
he escaped to a safer distance , a slight smile breaking his grim face 足 -- he had survived			0
" this job is very dangerous , " he explains , asking to remain anonymous			0
" the smoke , the heat 足 -- i can not count the number of people who have died in explosions because they can not escape the flames			1
" he is risking his life trying to refine diesel from oil in the swamps of @entity1 's oil - rich @entity0			1
the contraption looks like a crude school science project			0
the aim is to boil two barrels of oil to evaporate the diesel which then passes down a rusted pipe , cooled by water , and drips slowly out into a container at the other end			2
heating oil to such temperatures with such basic equipment is dangerous			2
having the distilled diesel only a few meters from a naked flame can be lethal			0
the surrounding trees and earth are blackened from the flames and explosions			0
the four young men working the illegal refineries stand a respectable distance from the flames until it is their turn to pour more oil on the fire			1
@entity1 is the fifth - largest oil exporter to the @entity58 but little money from the country 's oil industry has been invested in its main oil - producing region -- the @entity0			1
taken out over the region in a @entity66 helicopter , the illegal oil - refining sites look like small pockets of hell - 足 scorched earth with great flames leaping up from small dark craters			1
from the air , @entity66 facilities that have been attacked and the subsequent oil spills can be seen			2
the oil companies , the government and the communities below are locked in a battle of blame over who is responsible for the cycle of violence			0
meanwhile , the region is being plundered			0
there is little development and the majority of people live on less that $ 2 a day , despite the region 's vast oil wealth			1
and at the heart of the problem is corruption -- 足 billions of dollars worth of oil are being stolen in a massive illegal business known as " oil bunkering			2
" " i would put the figure at about 100,000 barrels a day , " explains @entity96 , the managing director of @entity66			1
" some of it is stolen in tankers			0
" sold abroad for a price of $ 60 a barrel , 100,000 barrels would be worth more than $ 2 billion a year			1
on monday , the crude oil futures market surged past $ 80 a barrel to its highest levels in three months			1
no - one has been prosecuted but reports accuse local politicians and the military of heavy involvement			0
the young men at the illegal refineries however collect their oil in dugout canoes , not tankers			1
they are not the major players			0
and they say they are tired of receiving all the blame and none of the money from @entity1 's oil industry			2
but when i asked if he saw a way out he simply shook his head			0
then he turned and ran to put more oil on the fire before it died out .			0

illegal refineries distill diesel from crude oil by heating over naked flames
worker : " i can not count the number of people who have died in explosions "
@entity1 is major oil exporter , but most in @entity0 live on less than $ 2 a day
@entity66 managing director estimates around 100,000 barrels stolen a day
