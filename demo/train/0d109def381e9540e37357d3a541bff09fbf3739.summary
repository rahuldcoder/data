@entity0 -- four decades since @entity3 , and little , it seems , has changed			1
the january 22 , 1973 , @entity6 decision legalizing abortion remains the law of the land , passions remain high on both sides of the issue , and protests are held each year on its anniversary			1
access to abortion , then and now , is about more than simple legalities			0
social , religious and family values , as well as finances and politics , still play a role in shaping the abortion issue , but many legal and medical experts say the debate has become entrenched			0
" much of the controversy about abortion is really stimulated by the interest groups on both sides of the political question , rather than by ordinary @entity33 , " said @entity25 , a law professor at the @entity27 , and a longtime @entity6 scholar			1
" the @entity33 people and many political leaders have already made up their minds about legal abortion			0
" public opinion on abortion has remained stable over the years			2
a @entity1 / @entity40 survey last august found 44 % said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances , while 52 % said only under few or no circumstances			0
and 88 % said the procedure should be allowed when the woman 's life is in danger ; 83 - percent said so in cases of rape or incest			0
the margin of error was plus - or - minus 3 points			0
the @entity3 decision did not prompt " abortion on demand , " as many opponents of the procedure had predicted it would			1
nor have various legislatures or court rulings restricted access as much as some supporters claim			0
research from the @entity64 finds the number of abortions at its lowest level since @entity3 , remaining steady at about 1.2 million reported procedures in the year 2011 , down 25 - percent since the all - time high in 1990			1
bans on abortion in the @entity33 began early in the 19th century			0
@entity71 in 1812 became first state to outlaw them , specifically after " quickening , " the time in the pregnancy when the woman starts to feel fetal movements			1
the laws were designed primarily to protect women from dangerous " back alley " abortions			2
these laws were also ambiguous , given the @entity82 moral code that stifled debate on so personal a subject as unwanted pregnancies			0
since then , movements have come and gone to relax the restrictions or to give women more choice , but such efforts mostly went nowhere			0
it was not until the 1960s that an organized movement was launched to ease the laws regulating abortions			2
medical technology had advanced to the point where they could be done safely by trained medical staff in clean , professional environments			0
by the early 1970s , a number of states had changed their laws , though most did so in very limited ways			0
survey : few religious groups want decision overturned despite abortion views the legal fights culminated with @entity3 , the court 's 7 - 2 decision giving women a qualified constitutional right to abortion during most of the pregnancy			1
the court , in fact , heard two cases around the same time : @entity3 ( aka @entity119 , who has since become an abortion opponent ) , which challenged a @entity123 law banning abortions except to save the woman 's life ; and @entity127 , involving a @entity129 law requiring that abortions be performed only in accredited hospitals and only after a review by a hospital staff committee and an exam by two doctors other than the woman 's physician			1
the @entity3 and @entity139 rulings affected laws in 46 states			1
for the justices , @entity3 reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy			1
that " right , " wrote justice @entity147 in the main opinion for the court , is " broad enough to encompass a woman 's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy			2
" " prior to @entity3 , " said @entity25 , " whether one could obtain a legal abortion in the face of an unwanted pregnancy was a crapshoot			1
for 40 years now , it 's been a constitutionally guaranteed right			1
" he is the 1994 author of " @entity160 : the @entity161 to @entity162 and the @entity163			0
" but the ruling was a qualified one , and that fact has been used by abortion opponents in their efforts to narrow the scope of other abortion provisions			0
@entity147 noted that the state 's " important interests in safeguarding health , maintaining medical standards , and protecting potential life " are compelling enough to justify regulation " at some point in pregnancy			0
" that " qualified right " found its form in the controversial " trimester analysis " laid out by the justices in @entity3 : permitting no government regulation during the first three months of a pregnancy ; allowing limited regulation in the second trimester to protect the woman 's health and safety ; and granting government the power to ban abortions during the third trimester -- a time when , medical consensus has concluded , the fetus is capable of living on its own			1
that reasoning has outraged abortion opponents and puzzled many legal scholars			0
" the better argument for the result reached in @entity3 , " said @entity201 -- a former law clerk for @entity147 and an author of " @entity203 : @entity211 , @entity212 , and @entity213 " -- " is that it 's necessary for the equality of women , rather than grounding it in the privacy right			1
" after @entity3 , the high court affirmed the right to abortion in subsequent cases : striking down provisions requiring a husband 's consent for a first - trimester abortion ; requiring parental consent for an unmarried woman under 18 ; striking down efforts to expand on laws requiring women to give informed consent before having an abortion ; striking down a 24 - hour waiting period ; and striking down a law requiring doctors to inform women of the risks and of assistance available if she were to carry the fetus to term			1
but there was one notable victory for abortion opponents : a ban on the use of taxpayer funds to finance abortions for poor women			2
the abortion issue has been revisited several times since @entity3 , most famously in @entity247 ( 1989 ) and @entity248 ( 1992 )			1
opinion : if @entity250 had @entity3 @entity247 ( a 5 - 4 decision ) upheld major parts of a @entity254 abortion law that prohibited the use of public facilities or the participation of public employees in abortions , and required doctors to test the viability of the fetus before an performing any abortion			1
justices @entity264 , @entity266 and @entity267 said they would allow restrictions on abortion , but only if the restrictions had a rational basis			0
more important , the three conservative justices said , a compelling government interest need not be required to justify restrictions on abortion			0
that was a blow for anti-abortion forces			0
then came the @entity248 ruling , in which the justices outlined their views on @entity3			1
the decision ( also 5 - 4 ) reaffirmed the heart of @entity3 while giving states the power to regulate procedures so long as they did not impose an " undue burden " on a woman 's right to abortion			1
the standard : undue burden exists if " the purpose and effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability			0
" the ruling left supporters on both sides of the issue dissatisfied , feeling it was ambiguous			2
justice @entity303 joined neither opinion , saying there was nothing in it to justify reconsidering @entity3			1
nevertheless , @entity147 wrote , " the right to reproductive choice " was in danger of being overturned			0
another legacy of @entity3 : the head - counting of justices on the court , a what - if scenario that could lead to the overturning of @entity3			1
the current 5 - 4 conservative majority might shift in either direction if two or more justices leave the bench in the next few years , as is widely expected			2
in the meantime , conservatives in @entity323 have promised to push for tougher restrictions on access to abortion , though many political experts say the goal is not necessarily aimed at overturning @entity3			1
they found success five years ago when the justices , in a 5 - 4 ruling , upheld a federal ban on a controversial late - term procedure , rejecting concerns the law did n't take into account the physical safety of the woman			1
the procedure -- called " partial birth abortion " by its critics -- is typically performed in the middle - to - late second trimester			0
the legal sticking point was that the law lacked a " health exception " for women who might suffer serious medical complications , something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions			2
the swing vote , as in previous cases , came from @entity267			0
in angry dissent , justice @entity355 , then the lone woman on the high court , called the majority 's conclusions " alarming " and said they " can not be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court , and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women 's lives			2
" @entity355 has long been a leading voice for gender equality			0
ironically , some of the opposition to her 1993 nomination to the high court came from feminists , who did not like her criticism over the legal reasoning of @entity3			1
she believed a more gradual liberalization to abortion would have kept the issue back in the states , avoiding the social and political upheaval that has been part of @entity3 's legacy			2
the law on abortion was evolving at the time of @entity3 , @entity355 recalled in 2005			1
" the @entity6 stopped all that by deeming every law -- even the most liberal -- as unconstitutional			2
that seemed to me not the way courts generally work			0
" but @entity355 , in her rulings , has upheld a woman 's reproductive choice			0
" when government controls that decision for her , she 's being treated as less than a full adult human being responsible for her own choices , " she said during her confirmation			2
if there is one overriding legacy of the @entity3 decision , it may be that it opened and expanded the debate on the rights of women , sexuality , health care , and medical decisions			1
issues like cloning , stem cells , and fetal research have become part of the national lexicon			0
as significant as it was , @entity3 was only the beginning of the battle .			2

40 years later , @entity3 remains the law of the land
passions still run high on both sides of the *landmark* decision
in 1812 , @entity71 outlawed abortions after " quickening "
