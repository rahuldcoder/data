@entity2 had a squad where we had 12 @entity27 players in the squad			2
it was a fantastic squad and he had always a great relation with every one of them			0
" while defending @entity4 , @entity1 insisted the @entity8 had been right to punish @entity4			1
" but in football it can happen , and i know it can happen , that during a football match -- because sometimes it 's more than a game -- sometimes you have reactions that do n't represent what you are really			0
" probably , he had a racist comment or a " racist " attitude against an opponent and , sometimes in football , we look to our opponents in the wrong way			0
but to pay , he has to be punished			0
racism remains " significant " problem in @entity50 football " but please , do n't say that he is a racist , because i know what i am saying			0
@entity54 will say , @entity55 will say , @entity56 will say , all of them will say that he is not a racist			0
