@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 wrote 509 pages of his tales of war -- from the swampy @entity7 in @entity8 to the frozen @entity9 in @entity10			1
his son typed them all up on an electric typewriter in the 1980s but unpublished , @entity3 's stories remained largely in his mind			1
@entity3 's story will soon be among 600 others on witness to @entity8 , a virtual library of @entity19 in combat			1
when his testimony is posted in a few days , viewers will be able to hear the former @entity24 captain , now a spry 91 , recount harrowing tales with photographic precision			2
some things never dulled in @entity3 's memory			2
like how fellow @entity24 " @entity36 " killed 19 @entity29 in their foxholes on the @entity32 island of @entity33 and was awarded a prestigious @entity34 for his " valiant fighting spirit			1
" " he had 20 rounds of ammunition ; killed 19 @entity29			2
@entity39 was a show - off , " @entity3 said of his fellow @entity24			2
" we do n't know how he got in their bunker			2
" @entity3 might have never gotten a chance to recount his stories had it not been for @entity0 entrepreneur @entity48 , the founder of @entity49			1
@entity48 's own interest in combat tales developed rather unusually			1
he did n't come from a military family			2
nor did he grow up like @entity3 's children , listening to war stories from daddy			1
he did n't even like history lessons in school , in which he learned about the sweeping nature of war -- dates and names , but nothing that gave a boy a clear idea of what it was like to be there			1
then , when he was 11 , @entity48 's mother gave him a pictorial history of @entity8 he flipped through the pages and stared at each photograph			1
what was it like to be there ? what did war smell like ? how did it feel to be wounded or watch someone die ? he earned a degree in military history at the @entity82 and more than anything , he wanted other @entity19 to appreciate the view from the foxhole as much as he did			1
later in @entity0 , he began attending @entity8 roundtable meetings			2
someone , he realized , needed to capture the veterans ' stories for posterity			1
he bought a camera and recording equipment and launched @entity49 in 2002			1
outside of his business consulting job , @entity48 spent his own money and time interviewing soldiers , @entity24 , sailors and airmen			1
it was a labor of love and a project that married his personal interest with a desire to give back to those who had sacrificed			2
war at home : a soldier 's war on two fronts today , it 's a searchable archive of 600 such accounts			1
@entity48 hopes to grow the virtual library by at least a thousand more tales in two years			1
eventually , he 'd like to see it all in the @entity114			2
he knows he 's racing against time with @entity8 veterans , many in their 90s , like @entity3 , or even older			1
they are dying off at the rate of 1,000 per day , according to the @entity121 , and taking their stories to cold graves			2
" every time a veteran dies , a library burns , " @entity48 said in his suburban @entity0 office			1
" what i learned in high school was the high - level view of things , not the horror of delivering freedom , " he said			2
" our mission is simple -- to preserve , honor and educate			2
" imagine , he said , if the stories of @entity138 or @entity139 veterans had been captured on video			1
@entity48 used to do all the interviews himself			1
now he has an assistant and hopes one day to be able to deploy a team of interviewers to record veterans ' stories			1
he has interviewed @entity148 recipients whose experiences are well known			2
but it 's those who have rarely spoken who interest @entity48 the most			1
and sometimes , it 's his curiosity that leads him to them			2
when @entity48 was visiting his father 's grave in @entity158 , @entity159 , he noticed a dual grave with two headstones			1
the father had passed away , but there was only a birth date for the son			2
it was an unusual name : @entity167			2
@entity48 looked up @entity168 and ended up eating breakfast at @entity170 with him , listening to stories about @entity29 soldiers and their combat tactics and agreed to tell them on camera			1
shortly afterwards , @entity168 developed @entity176 's and could no longer recall his experiences			2
eventually , the disease took his life			0
but his story lives on because of @entity48 's project			1
sometimes , the interviews are emotional , filled with painful pauses and tears			0
others are cathartic , as it was for @entity187 , who fought with the 4th infantry in @entity8 @entity187 told @entity48 how he had come across dead @entity19 during his first combat experience in @entity190 , some with their throats slit			1
it was meant to scare the living			0
or another time , when he fired his @entity197 rifle at a @entity199 soldier close up in the dark			0
" i can see it just as plain today as i did that night			0
shooting at him so much until his body , his hips , in that area , looked like it was on fire			0
" all the while @entity187 speaks , his eyes never meet @entity48 's camera			1
it was the first time he had talked about his combat memories publicly			1
@entity48 is constantly on a search for more stories			1
he contacted @entity3 after he read an account of the 17 days of brutal battle in @entity10 's @entity9 on its 60th anniversary			1
the @entity24 were encircled by @entity219 troops			0
they fought for their lives			0
@entity48 said he was struck by the accounts of hand - to - hand combat with @entity219 troops			1
@entity3 said many of his fellow @entity24 froze to death as they were forced to retreat south			0
when the @entity219 charged down a hill , he gave the orders : a bayonet or a bullet			0
" we had to do what we had to do , " he said			0
" not too proud of it			0
" @entity3 , then a captain , started off with 500 men under him			0
after @entity9 , he was left with 75			0
the temperatures fell to 16 below			0
the dead were covered up and left to freeze			0
@entity3 said " @entity239 " was the code name for ammunition			0
but somebody who loaded up the ammo for airdrops thought the @entity24 wanted candy			0
so with every case of ammo came the sweet stuff			0
" you could do nothing with food or water , " he said , referring to the frigid weather			0
" but you could put a @entity239 under your arm			0
it would get warm and soft			0
" @entity3 also told @entity48 a harrowing tale of napalm , when there were hundreds of @entity219 soldiers coming their way and the @entity260 stepped in to save the surrounded @entity24			1
there were four planes -- one to spot and three to attack			0
" the second plane dropped his napalm but not the third or fourth			0
at the same time @entity24 from all sides opened up with mortars and heavy machine guns			0
" why did n't you drop ? " the second pilot asked the others			0
" there was no target left , " they replied			0
" we had massacred them , " @entity3 said			0
@entity3 was honored to be able to share his stories			0
" i 'm glad they picked me , " he said			0
@entity48 looked at @entity3 and his son and thought about all the lifelines that were stopped by war , all the families that never were because a man died on the battlefield			1
he said he felt a need to make the connection between the sacrifices that were made and the freedoms that @entity19 enjoy			0
he was thankful for men like @entity3 , who survived to tell			0
they were warriors who became walking libraries .			0
