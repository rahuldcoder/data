@entity0 , @entity1 -- the horse 's name is @entity5			1
he was bred for speed			2
this great - great - grandson of the legendary @entity8 had won nearly $ 200,000 in prize money at tracks around @entity1			2
it had been a modestly successful racing career , but by december of last year it was over			1
the coulda , woulda , shoulda @entity14 winners @entity5 was breaking down			2
because of injuries to his tendons and leg joints @entity5 could barely stand , let alone race			2
like many spent and injured racehorses , @entity5 was destined for euthanasia or a @entity23 slaughterhouse supplying horse meat to restaurants in @entity26 and @entity27			1
he sold at auction for $ 190			2
injury sidelines ' i 'll have another ' from @entity32 it was at that point that @entity35 came into @entity5 's life			2
@entity35 runs @entity37 , a horse rescue operation in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" he deserves another chance , " said @entity35			0
most days , he would simply lay in his stall , in pain and misery , @entity35 said			0
after months of expensive veterinary care , today @entity46 is slowly healing			0
but for hundreds of other racehorses , there is no happy ending			0
" they are literally running for their lives , " said @entity50 of the @entity51 , or @entity51			0
" if they run too fast they break down on the track and die			1
and if they do n't run fast enough , they are discarded			0
" the @entity59 -- the registry for thoroughbred horses in the @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 -- estimates that 15 thoroughbreds die on @entity62 racetracks every week			1
those figures do not include other breeds of horses that also race in the @entity62			1
" when you extrapolate that to quarter - horse racing and standardbred racing , you realize the numbers are astronomical , " @entity70 said			1
the @entity51 is pushing for federal regulation to halt the use of performance enhancing drugs on the racetrack			1
" they are injecting cocaine			0
they are injecting cancer drugs into horses in order to mask pain , " said @entity70			0
" they are even injecting snake venom			0
" she said the proposed @entity90 would remove oversight from a hodgepodge of seemingly ineffective state commissions			0
as the sun rises above @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity1 , the horses take to the track			0
this was the location where @entity5 spent most of his racing career			1
there is an air of calm and peace at this racing oval at the foot of the @entity108			1
but racetrack ceo @entity109 knows that his sport is under pressure			0
" horse racing on its own has too much infighting , " @entity109 said			1
" everyone is looking up and saying , ' the public does n't even care about us anymore			0
' " overheard on @entity2 : if wishes were horses , ' another ' secretariat would rise but @entity109 bristles at charges that his sport mistreats horses			0
" the last thing you want to do is bring families and friends ( to the track ) and have a horse break down , " @entity109 said			1
he also stressed that the industry has raised millions of dollars to provide a comfortable retirement for aging racehorses			1
in recent years , @entity96 has spent millions more installing an artificial race surface in an effort to reduce racing injuries			1
but @entity109 said the new surface did n't work			0
there were constant problems keeping the track in proper condition to race			0
while mortality rates during races were lowered , trainers complained that the new surface was causing an increase in training injuries			0
the artificial surface has since been replaced by a traditional dirt track			0
racehorse fatalities at @entity96 are back up , the highest in the state			0
in addition to racing incidents , three horses were killed during the filming of horse race scenes at @entity96 for the @entity157 tv series , " @entity158			1
" attendance at racetracks nationwide is falling			1
that 's why federal regulation is needed , according to the @entity51			1
@entity70 said the sport could regain its popularity if people believed it was cleaning up its act			0
" in sports where people compete , we have prohibitions on the use of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs , " she said			0
" but for some reason we 've allowed horse racing to slip through the cracks			1
" some of racing 's greatest horses have met horrific fates			2
in 2008 , @entity181 snapped both front legs in the @entity183 and was euthanized in front of a tv audience of millions			2
two years earlier , @entity183 winner @entity186 broke his leg racing in the @entity188			2
in 2002 , the horse racing world was rocked by the news that 1986 @entity183 winner @entity191 was apparently killed in a @entity27 slaughterhouse			1
industry groups said $ 35 million a year is spent on equine drug testing			2
they said the problem is being blown out of proportion , but some in horse racing want state racing groups to agree to uniform medication standards as a way of controlling what violations do exist			1
horse racing 's critics said these and other deaths are not isolated tragedies , but rather part of a callous pattern within the inner world of the racing industry			1
veterinarian @entity213 has been guiding @entity46 back along the long road to recovery			0
the horse 's future is still far from certain			2
but he said he hopes that one day soon @entity46 will be able to bear a rider around the shaded grounds of his new home .			0

an estimated 15 thoroughbreds die on @entity62 racetracks every week
those that survive may be auctioned to slaughterhouses or euthanized
