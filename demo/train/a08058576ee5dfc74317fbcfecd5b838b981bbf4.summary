@entity0 -- six heat - trapping gases that contribute to air pollution pose potential health hazards , the @entity2 said friday in a landmark announcement that could lead to regulation of the gases			1
" this finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem , " epa administrator @entity9 said			0
the gases -- carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride -- have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world , the @entity2 said			1
the @entity25 @entity24 ordered the @entity2 's scientific review in 2007			1
" this finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations , " epa administrator @entity9 said in a release , later adding , " the science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions , and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate			1
" the @entity2 's finding now goes into a public comment period			1
the report , titled " assessment of the impacts of @entity49 on @entity25 air quality : a synthesis of @entity48 , " is the culmination of a study started in 2000 , the @entity2 said			1
the @entity54 moved quickly to try to squelch any concerns that the @entity2 would immediately issue any regulations concerning the gases			1
" the president has made clear his strong preference that @entity61 act to pass comprehensive legislation rather than address the climate challenge through administrative action , " @entity54 spokesman @entity58 said			2
" that 's why the president has repeatedly called for a bill to provide for market - based solutions to reduce carbon pollution and transition to a clean - energy economy that creates millions of green jobs			2
" the @entity2 announcement comes amid efforts by @entity61 to enact a limit on global warming pollution			1
the @entity76 is scheduled to begin hearings next week on a comprehensive energy and climate bill , called the @entity80			1
committee chairman @entity81 is said to want the bill out of committee by @entity84 , which falls on may 25 , and @entity54 speaker @entity85 said she wants to bring the bill to the @entity54 floor for a vote this year			2
environmentalists hailed the @entity2 's announcement , with the nonprofit @entity91 calling it a " historic step ... [ that ] formally determined that global warming pollution ' endangers ' the nation 's human health and well - being			1
" " the @entity25 is taking its first steps as a nation to confront climate change , " said @entity97 , deputy general counsel at the environmental advocacy group			2
" global warming threatens our health , our economy , and our children 's prosperity			0
@entity2 's action is a wake - up call for national policy solutions that secure our economic and environmental future			2
" but critics say the finding will just produce a " glorious mess			0
" " today 's action by the @entity2 is the beginning of a regulatory barrage that will destroy jobs , raise energy prices for consumers and undermine @entity125 's global competitiveness , " said sen. @entity115 , @entity116 , the ranking member on the @entity117			1
" it now appears @entity2 's regulatory reach will find its way into schools , hospitals , assisted living facilities and just about any activity that meets minimum thresholds in the @entity134			0
" the @entity2 notes in an accompanying report released friday that global warming could make ozone pollution worse in some parts of the @entity125			0
future ozone management decisions may have to take into account the possible effects of global warming , the report says			0
" climate change , along with other aspects of global change , including changes in population , land use and the technologies employed for energy production and transportation , may alter the capacity for @entity25 states to successfully attain the national air quality standards in the future , " the report concludes			2
ground - level ozone is formed when sunlight causes a chemical reaction in the air between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by motor vehicles and industrial plants			0
ozone levels are typically higher on sunny days in areas that have many vehicles or smoke - stack industries			0
global warming also could increase the number of days with weather conditions conducive to forming ozone , potentially causing air quality alerts earlier in the spring and later in the fall , the report says			0
in addition to health problems , the report says global warming could lead to increased drought , more heavy downpours and flooding , and more frequent and intense heat waves and wildfires			0
global warming could also cause a greater rise in sea level , more intense storms and harm to water resources , agriculture , wildlife and ecosystems , the report said			0
