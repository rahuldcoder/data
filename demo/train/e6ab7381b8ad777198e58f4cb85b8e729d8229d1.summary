-- the @entity1 in @entity2 houses one of the largest collections of treasure in @entity6 , with its spectacular baroque chambers filled with jewels and objets d'art			1
although these masterpieces are comparable with those of @entity12 or @entity13 , they have yet to achieve the renown of the @entity16 museums			0
but with restoration of the castle completed last year , the @entity1 stands out as the jewel - box of @entity6 for its exceptional art and architecture , and its representation of one of the world 's great cultural cities			1
in the early 18th century , @entity28 , ruler of @entity27 , worked to establish @entity2 as a major center for the arts , inviting talented sculptors , goldsmiths and painters to take up residence			1
he commissioned a series of magnificent rooms to showcase his valuables as a way of advertising the city 's cultural prominence in addition to its wealth			2
the result was the @entity1 , the first public museum in @entity6			1
it is an astounding collection of ornaments , ranging from shimmering bowls carved out of crystal and agate to jeweled gold figurines to the @entity50 , the largest and finest green diamond in the world			1
during the @entity54 bombing of 1945 , @entity2 was decimated , and the vault was destroyed			1
though the treasures had been relocated to a fortress , they were later confiscated by the @entity59 and taken to @entity60			2
in 1958 , the jewels were returned to @entity2 , but most of the pieces were not on public display until 2004 , after a reconstruction project costing over 45 million euros			1
striking photos reveal hidden history of black @entity68 in the @entity70 era today , this splendid museum is divided into two parts			2
in the elegant @entity74 , individual pieces are shown in modern minimalist cases , with lighting and technology designed precisely to enhance each object			0
downstairs , the @entity80 recreates the grand halls of @entity28 , with rooms devoted to specific materials such as ivory and amber , and suites of gems classified by color			1
these rooms are baroque works of art in themselves , mirrored and painted malachite green with gold trimmings			0
the curiosities here include goblets fashioned from gilded ostrich eggs , ivory towers with impossibly tiny spirals and a radiant cabinet of carved amber			0
the @entity74 is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its opening , and it contains over a thousand of @entity28 ' best pieces , which were intended to stun visitors and subjects with a show of extravagance and craftsmanship			1
among the highlights are drinking vessels engraved with @entity113 motifs and jewelry inspired by the royal court of @entity116			0
it is fascinating to see how often @entity6 ideals of luxury took the form of orientalist fantasies during this period			0
according to dr. @entity124 , professor of art history at the @entity126 , the @entity123 had acquired a legendary reputation at this time , becoming a symbol of " power and wealth [ that ] could only be imagined and envied by @entity6 rulers ... a fairytale image of magnificence to be admired and imitated			0
" how some whisky lovers are now making millions @entity28 ' most valued possession was a miniature diorama depicting the unlimited riches of the @entity123 emperor @entity138 , @entity28 ' contemporary on the @entity141 subcontinent			1
@entity138 , who was referred to as the " world - seizer , " is seen at his 50th birthday celebrations during the height of the empire			2
from his throne , he receives rajahs and princes ; dishes filled with gold coins and elephants draped in gems are presented as gifts			0
in an unusual twist , the walls of the court are decorated with @entity113 dragons , so that a dream of orientalism becomes even more fantastic			0
this diorama was created over seven years by the great goldsmith and royal jeweler , @entity163 , and features rubies , emeralds , pearls , over 4000 diamonds and a single sapphire			0
only 58 centimeters tall , it cost @entity28 more than the construction of the opulent @entity171			1
@entity163 is responsible for several of the masterworks in the collection , including the @entity174 , a prestigious insignia with three flaming rubies used to signify the values of knighthood			0
his most iconic piece may be the so - called @entity180 with @entity181 , a statue of a dark - skinned young prince ( whose tattoos are actually native american ) bearing a tortoiseshell platter of @entity188 emeralds			0
the memorabilia honoring @entity191 space dogs like the city of @entity2 , the @entity1 has been strategically rebuilt , in a style which combines modern and baroque elements			1
for @entity197 , director of the @entity198 , the construction of the vault has caused people in @entity27 to " fundamentally rethink our architectural heritage , " more than any building of the last century			0
the @entity74 is a triumph of sleek lines and cutting - edge presentation ; for its 10th anniversary , a new lighting scheme has been introduced to focus the gaze on individual works			0
on the other hand , the restored historic section embodies the total fusion of art and architecture envisioned by @entity28			2
as such , the vault reflects @entity2 's two sides : its past as the " @entity218 " and its current status as a hub for contemporary design			1
