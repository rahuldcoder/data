@entity5 when @entity2 justices opened the current term in october by declining to take up several gay marriage cases , it seemed they might avoid the blockbuster docket of the past few years			1
by november , the @entity2 accepted yet another challenge to the @entity10 — the signature legislative achievement of the @entity13 administration			1
in a matter of weeks , the justices heard arguments concerning pregnancy discrimination in the workplace and the @entity20 implications of threats made on @entity22			1
in january , they decided to take up a challenge to gay marriage , and for good measure , also agreed to hear a case regarding @entity29 's lethal injection protocol			1
" the term went from being one of the more uneventful terms in recent years to potentially one of the biggest ones in a generation " says @entity2 expert @entity30 who is the editor of @entity31			1
here 's a glimpse of some of what has been decided , what has been heard and what is to come : what has been decided religious freedom in prison : a unanimous @entity2 ruled in favor of the religious freedom claims of @entity49 , an @entity50 inmate who wanted to grow a beard in accordance with his @entity54 faith , but was blocked by the @entity56 ' policy that forbid beards except for diagnosed dermatological problems			1
justice @entity59 wrote the opinion holding that the prison policy violated a federal law designed to protect the religious exercise of prisoners			1
the @entity65 proclaimed the decision a " huge win for religious freedom " for all @entity69			1
but in a very brief concurring opinion , justice @entity70 , joined by justice @entity71 , distanced the case from last year 's @entity75 decision			1
what has been heard separation of powers : a 12 year old @entity69 boy , born in @entity81 , is caught in the middle of a significant dispute between @entity84 and the executive branch			2
the disagreement began in 2002 when the parents of @entity88 sought to have " @entity89 " recorded in his passport as the place of his birth pursuant to a federal law passed in 2002			2
sounds simple right ? not according to the @entity97 , which refuses to implement the law			2
the executive branch says that because @entity89 and @entity101 leaders have long been engaged in a dispute over the status of @entity81 , it avoids any official act that might be perceived as taking sides			2
the current policy is to list " @entity81 " as the place of birth instead of " @entity89			2
" the @entity109 seek to compel the @entity97 to follow the law			2
they argue that @entity84 has broad power over passports , and that this case is about the identify of a passport holder			2
a lower court disagreed holding that the law " impermissibly intrudes " on the president 's authority to decide whether and on what terms to recognize foreign nations			1
race and redistricting : recently , conservative republicans have accused @entity124 of using racial considerations improperly in the drawing of legislative maps			2
democrats are challenging plans drawn by a @entity132 - led legislature			2
the @entity124 say the plans packed too many blacks into too few districts			2
experts like @entity136 of @entity137 , say the opinion could offer clues of how much the @entity2 is willing to tolerate race - conscious districting under the @entity142 " consistent with a belief that all race conscious efforts are subject to close scrutiny			1
" @entity22 and the @entity20 : " there 's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you			0
" that 's one of the messages @entity154 posted on his @entity22 account after his wife left him			0
other postings were so violent that his former wife sought protection and @entity154 was ultimately convicted under a federal threat statute			0
but he 's seeking to overturn his conviction			0
he argues he was devastated after his wife left him and that he turned to rap lyrics as therapy			0
he says much of what he wrote was similar to the work of his idol @entity168			0
the case offers the justices an opportunity to clarify the scope of the " true threats " exception of the @entity20 in the relatively new world of social media			0
pregnancy discrimination : almost 40 years after the passage of the @entity180 , pro-choice and pro-life groups have come together asking the justices to clarify the reach of the law			0
@entity183 was working for the @entity184 in 2006 when she got pregnant and was told by her doctor not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds for the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy			0
she asked her supervisor for a temporary accommodation but was told that @entity184 did not give light duty for pregnancy			0
she sued , citing the language of the @entity180 ( pda ) that says that employers must treat pregnant employees the same as " other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work			0
" @entity199 said that @entity184 offered light duty for a category of workers and that she should have been included			0
@entity184 argued that it treated @entity199 the same way it treated other employees " with similar lifting restrictions resulting from an off - the job injury or condition " and did not discriminate on account of her pregnancy			0
what 's coming up obamacare : on march 4 , the @entity2 will hear a challenge to a section of the @entity10 concerning the subsidies available to individuals who purchase competitively priced insurance from the @entity218			1
as things stand now , 16 states and the @entity5 have established their own exchanges , while 34 states have opted to have federally - facilitated exchanges			0
at issue : who qualifies for the subsidies ? the federal government say that all qualifying individuals are eligible			0
but challengers say that the law is clear : only those living in states with state - run exchanges can receive the subsidies			0
if the @entity2 agrees with the challengers , the ruling could impact more than 5 million people and severely destabilize the entire law			1
members of @entity84 who crafted the law say in a friend of the court brief that it was " widely understood that the tax credits would be available to all @entity69 who satisfied the statute 's income criteria regardless of where they lived			1
" gay marriage : sometime in late april , the @entity2 will take up whether states can ban gay marriage			1
attorney general @entity247 has vowed to file a brief and urge the justices " to make marriage equality a reality for all @entity69			0
" the justices will be reviewing the only recent appellate court decision that upheld state bans			1
the lower court said in part that the decision should be left to the democratic process			1
" the people do n't get to decide what the @entity260 safeguards , " says @entity262 of @entity263 , " they do n't get to vote to violate the @entity260			1
" lethal injection : three inmates are challenging @entity29 's lethal injection protocol , after the botched execution of @entity269 last april			0
at issue is the first drug — midazolam -- used in the three drug protocol that critics say violates the @entity260 's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment			0
lawyers for the inmates say the drug fails to maintain unconsciousness			0
in 2008 , the @entity2 found that @entity281 's lethal injection protocol was constitutional , but since then states have struggled to obtain drugs and frequently changed their protocols .			1
