-- a small @entity2 wild horse that was used in @entity4 experiments during the 1930s has become the center of wetland regeneration efforts across parts of @entity9			1
the rare @entity11 breed is one of @entity2 's least known ecological exports and is believed to be descended from the @entity14 ; a prehistoric horse that roamed wild in @entity9 until the end of the 19th century and whose last known individual died in a @entity19 zoo in 1909			1
@entity20 , president of the @entity21 , says the group 's breeding program has helped to stock reserves in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and the @entity28 with small herds that graze on the woody stems of invasive bushes allowing indigenous growth to re-establish itself -- sometimes after decades and even centuries of agricultural use			2
" once farming stopped in these marshlands , bush began to grow , which limits the habitat for many marshland birds that need the open space , " says @entity20			0
" the horses graze on the bark and seedlings of these bushes , which limits its growth , allowing the marshland to survive			0
" @entity20 says that the horses mirror the natural fauna that would have roamed the area in prehistoric times , helping to return land to its pristine condition			1
" they are the closest breed to the original wild horse of @entity9 -- the type we see painted on caves in @entity58 and @entity26 20,000 years ago , " he says			1
" but because of @entity61 farming they were pushed out of most @entity9 except for small pockets in @entity2 , @entity19 and the @entity63			1
" send in your photos from @entity2 in one of the strangest stories of pre-war @entity2 , the @entity11 came to the attention of biologists in the 1930s who saw that horses in the @entity73 in @entity2 retained certain features of the @entity14			1
@entity2 biologist @entity75 noticed that semi-wild horses used by peasants in @entity73 displayed the @entity14 's mousey dun color , their coats turning to white in winter , another @entity14 characteristic			1
while many regard @entity84 's mustang or the @entity86 brumby as a wild horse , zoologists say that strictly speaking these are really feral domesticated horses			2
@entity75 launched a re-breeding program , mating horses with strong @entity14 - like characteristics , in an attempt to regain the lost breed of horse			1
at the same time , the breed came to the attention of @entity97 , the director of @entity98 who , along with his brother @entity101 , the head of the @entity100 , began a re-breeding program			2
@entity97 was a committed @entity4 and zoologist whose efforts to " re-breed " extinct species such as the prehistoric ancestor to the modern cow the @entity108 , received support from senior nazis such as @entity111			1
while the re-breeding of extinct species by mating animals of similar characteristics is regarded as impossible by modern science , the @entity110 experimented with a program aimed at resurrecting prehistoric animals that reflected @entity4 claims to racial purity			1
when the @entity110 invaded @entity2 in 1939 , many of the horses in the breeding program of @entity75 were stolen and brought to @entity27			2
the horses met a grisly end , most probably eaten by a hungry populace , along with many of the animals in @entity129 and @entity100 zoos , in the closing stages of the @entity132			0
" the best animals were taken to @entity27 and we do n't know exactly what happened to them			0
it was only after the @entity132 we started from scratch again , " says @entity20			0
" the @entity110 did n't take all the animals , " he says			0
" they did n't know the war would end the way it ended so they only took the best specimens			0
later , well of course , they were busy with other things so there were still some horses left			0
" @entity149 thrive in primeval @entity2 forests @entity151 , the nature warden for @entity153 at @entity154 , says the @entity11 -- first introduced to @entity25 in 1995 -- has been an instant hit with ecologists and conservationists			1
" we 've currently got them on the site of an old dairy ; land which we say has been ' agriculturally improved ' with herbicide or fertilizers , " he says			0
" that lush green grass , however , makes it more difficult for the rarer , more specialized plants to flourish and eventually they disappear			0
" the @entity11 are perfectly adapted to a variety of harsh environments , from wetlands to open forests , requiring little veterinary care for problems such as hoof rot that might afflict other horse breeds in similarly wet conditions			1
the grazing is introduced to take the nutrients out of the ground to take it back to a state where it 's unimproved , " says @entity151			2
" that takes a lot of time and a lot of grazing			0
" @entity189 hay from sites where indigenous plants grow is then spread on the site after grazing in the hope that some of the native species will establish themselves in the soil			0
the horses breed well and flourish without the need for the kind of intervention that so fascinated @entity4 scientists , says @entity151			2
" the @entity110 were very interested in the whole idea of racial purity , " he adds			2
" it seems it did n't just extend to human being , but to beasts as well			0
