political ads on the airwaves have been so pervasive this year that voters in battleground states probably see them in their sleep			1
but when a political spot pops up while surfing the @entity8 , there 's a good chance it 's aimed right at you			1
the practice is called microtargeting and like a lot of marketing techniques on the internet aimed at identifying consumer tastes and behaviors , it is an information - age approach that is helping change how political groups identify and interact with voters			1
moreover , microtargeting may give pollsters , campaigns and interest groups a sharper idea of how candidates and issues may fare at the ballot box , raising concerns about personal privacy in a medium where government regulation is minimal			1
@entity33 , @entity34 make a mad dash in a final bid for votes in fact , " there is none , " said @entity39 , legislative counsel for the @entity40			0
" @entity43 has been crucial to our political process			1
it 's the reason for the secret ballot , it 's the reason the @entity49 were anonymous , " he said			0
surfing the @entity8 leaves a trail of browser history that allows marketing companies to glean insight into personal interests			1
do you read the @entity56 or watch @entity57 ? do you have children ? do you shop in high - end stores or hunt for bargains on @entity61 ? do you support the @entity62 or @entity63 ? political strategy firms like @entity65 and @entity66 are gathering or buying up that data			1
they then match it to the publicly available voter rolls that were digitized as a part of a new federal law aimed at efforts to help improve voting procedures after the ballot controversies of the 2000 election			1
what these firms receive is detailed information about how often a potential voter has cast a ballot in addition to data on what they read , where they shop and other consumer behavior tracked for decades off line			1
@entity89 of @entity65 said the company has so far aggregated more than 600 million cookies -- or tags on internet user ip addresses that track movements online -- and has worked to match them against lists of some 250 million voters in the @entity98			1
this all is aimed at helping them determine how someone might vote and then reaching them wherever they go online			0
@entity104 offers clues to early vote leads it is so efficient and such a natural extension of direct mail that @entity110 called the way microtargeting is being used today " inevitable			2
" in response to privacy advocates , @entity66 president @entity112 and @entity110 said they are n't doing anything that has n't been done before			0
" the data has been commercially available data for years -- we 're not targeting you by who you voted for ; we 're targeting you if you tend to vote or participate in the democratic process , " @entity112 said			0
and he said these strategies infringe less on privacy because they do n't use names or physical mailing addresses like direct mail			0
" the reality is that we are more focused on privacy and we have more privacy protections than direct mail ... has used for decades , " @entity112 said			0
this they said is because lists generated from browser histories are stripped of any personal information before they are used to target potential voters			1
both companies said they use a third party vendor to remove that data and match the files			1
@entity112 would n't identify @entity66 's vendor , calling it " part of the special sauce			0
" @entity65 and @entity66 are n't the only ones in the game			2
final @entity147 / @entity146 national poll : it 's all tied up @entity150 , @entity151 and other data powerhouses are also in on the action , albeit in a different way			0
for instance , @entity150 said it does n't collect or allow its advertisers to use personally identifiable information , including political information , to reach potential customers or voters			1
but it does allow marketers , political or otherwise , to target its users based on specific demographic information			2
the company launched its @entity165 and campaign tools via @entity167 , offering candidates the chance to " promote your videos using @entity172 for video to reach exactly the audience you want -- by age , gender , location or other criteria			2
" @entity151 is also using its vast amount of personal information during the election			0
currently there are more than 110,000 political @entity151 pages in the @entity98 and more than 11,000 @entity98 - based pages for politicians , according to a @entity151 spokesman			1
while @entity151 does n't hand over personally identifiable information , it does allow advertisers to seek out subsections of the population based on their preferences on @entity151			0
@entity192 also reported on how other search engine giants are selling their users ' browser history to campaigns			1
what companies , who follow a model of self regulation , and campaigns are doing is n't popular with the public			1
when asked if they wanted " political advertising tailored to your interests , " 86 % of @entity98 surveyed said they did not , according to a study from the @entity211 's @entity210 school of @entity212 released last july			1
provisional ballots could be key if @entity215 margin razor thin sixty - four percent said their support for a candidate would decrease if they found out a candidate was microtargeting them differently than their neighbor			1
the study also found that 20 % more respondents reacted more strongly to political targeting than they did to being targeted as a consumer			1
" there 's a lot to say in favor of campaigns targeting voters in this way , ( but ) there is a lot to be concerned about , " said @entity228 , a political science professor at @entity229 who studies the impact of microtargeting on campaigns and the political process			1
" people like being targeted in many ways , " said @entity228			2
" many people like that @entity247 knows what kind of books they like			0
if a campaign knows that you 're of this religion and this race and went to college , you 're likely to have a different set of values ... the campaign is likely to reach out to you on those attributes			2
" but there is always a danger that the campaign will misfire or that the ads will seem like " pandering , " @entity228 said			0
" the downside , of course , is that we might not like being stereotyped , " he explained			0
still , microtargeting makes an uphill process easier for the campaigns , especially at the presidential level			1
" how do you start by trying to convince 200 million people that you they should vote for you ? " asked @entity228			0
" the task is hard			0
data helps and permits campaigns to talk to people about issues they care about , " he continued			2
and the data does help			0
know your polling place besides ads that show up before a @entity167 video or banner ads on the websites users visit , they dictate scripts that door - to - door canvassers read			0
they also improve efficiency of campaign voter turnout efforts and reduce costs since ads online are significantly less expensive than television spots			2
in the age of @entity296 , microtargeting can also guarantee that voters actually see campaign ads. " we can serve a pre-roll video ad , " @entity110 said , referring to ads viewers see before videos online , " which is great stuff , it forces you to watch it before you get to your content			1
the big problem for advertisers these days is that everyone is fast forwarding through their videos			0
" a sign of how often these ads are used by political campaigns -- " online video inventory has been sold out , " @entity112 said , in many of the key battleground states looking into the final days of the campaign			1
privacy and civil liberties activists do n't propose shutting down online advertising			2
instead , they favor an opt - in versus the opt - out option currently available to consumers and voters -- a " @entity329 " mechanism			2
@entity39 says the trick is not getting browsers to add the mechanism , but getting other web companies to agree to it			2
@entity334 recently said it would not honor the " @entity329 " button @entity336 is installing in @entity337			0
could close race produce a popular / electoral vote split ? " the pushback has been that there is a business model out there that wants to track you all the time , " @entity39 said			0
" they can wring more and more advertising dollars out of you			2
" but do n't look for this practice to end			0
@entity112 says it 's just the beginning			0
looking toward the next election cycle , @entity66 signed a deal with @entity353 combining @entity353 's mobile network with its online voter data files			0
the next frontier is to reach voters with ads on their " ip - addressable " television sets , serving the same targeted ads that people see online , during the commercial breaks on their favorite shows			1
and @entity112 says they are adding data crunching power to what he calls " rich data sets			0
" as @entity370 political science professor @entity369 said , " there 's no turning back on microtargeting			1
" why they ca n't break margin of error			0

campaigns use microtargeting to reach key voting blocs in key battleground states
firms match voter lists to browser history to find potential voters
many of the largest search engine companies are in on the microtargeting game
86 % of @entity98 say they object to targeted political advertising
