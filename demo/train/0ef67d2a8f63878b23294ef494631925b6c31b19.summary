-- with his health in question and speculation rampant about his future , @entity2 president @entity1 has named 10 @entity2 to an influential commission			1
the @entity8 , as it is known , is stipulated in the @entity9 as the highest circle of advisers to the president , but has never actually been formed			1
now in a battle with cancer , @entity1 announced in january that it was time to constitute the council , and wednesday named his appointments			1
@entity2 and international observers alike are likely to scrutinize his choices for any signs of transition or succession should @entity1 become incapacitated			2
@entity1 's choices include a veteran of his administration , a military man and a writer , among others			2
the president of the council will be vice president @entity31 , as the constitution stipulates			1
@entity1 named five principal members			1
among them are @entity35 , a journalist who came to hold a number of posts under @entity1 , including foreign minister , defense minister and vice president			1
@entity2 's former ambassador to the @entity41 and former foreign minister @entity42 was also named to the council			0
@entity44 was elected by the country 's national assembly as ombudsman from 2000 to 2007			0
@entity48 is an active duty admiral who currently serves as secretary of the country 's defense council			0
@entity1 also named @entity52 , a playwright and author , to the council			1
in addition , the president listed five others as alternate members			2
the timing of the appointments is significant , as speculation increases over who will succeed @entity1 if he becomes too ill to govern , or if he dies			2
he has been reluctant to name a successor , but the @entity8 , as envisioned in the constitution , stands to wield significant influence			1
the council is the " highest body of advisers " to the government , the constitution states			1
" there are no surprising names here , " said @entity71 , a professor of political science at @entity73			0
with so much uncertainty surrounding @entity1 's health and the upcoming elections , the appointments answer part of the puzzle of who is close to @entity1 , he said			0
but it does not end the uncertainty , he added			0
whether the group simply advises @entity1 , or a successor , or takes up more powers of its own , " anything is possible , " @entity71 said			0
he envisioned a hypothetical scenario in which @entity1 remained president , but , too ill to make decisions , delegated power to the council			1
@entity1 in january said the council was " an institution that we lack and that is in the constitution but that we never activated			1
the time to activate it has come			0
" the fact that @entity31 , as vice president , will preside over the council elevates his status and could signal a victory for those supporting him as a potential successor to @entity1			1
@entity106 and @entity107 , who are trying to influence the succession , favor @entity31 , said @entity109 , an analyst with the conservative @entity110 and former @entity112 ambassador to the @entity41			2
analysts also say @entity1 's brother , @entity114 , is also liked by the @entity115			0
but @entity1 is not the only one with say on the council members			2
according to the constitution , the national assembly and the supreme court get to name one person each to the body			0
both institutions are favorable to the president			0
the governors of all the states will also have to pick one governor to be part of the council , too			0
@entity0 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
