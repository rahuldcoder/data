-- rumored for years , the long - awaited smartwatch from @entity2 may finally become reality in a few months			1
the @entity4 and @entity5 are both reporting that the @entity8 , if that is in fact it 's name , will be released this fall , likely in october			2
the @entity4 says the watch will come in multiple sizes and have 10 sensors for tasks like health and fitness tracking			1
@entity5 says the watch will have a 2.5 - inch screen and be " slightly rectangular			1
" both outlets cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter			2
there 's no reason to doubt the reports , really			2
@entity2 's top brass have all gone on the record suggesting a new product from @entity2 will be released by the end of this year			1
so , with the countdown likely begun , we take a look at five features we 'd like to see on @entity2 's smartwatch			1
really be ' smart ' the dirty little secret of smartwatches , at least so far ? they are n't really smart in the same way that a smartphone is			2
so far , the offerings from @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and the like have operated as extensions of a smartphone , linking up via @entity44 or wireless to , for the most part , serve you notifications that you could have seen by pulling your phone out of your pocket			0
@entity2 may do something along those lines as well and could still make a successful product			1
but with their close ties with app developers , we 'd love to see @entity2 make the first smartwatch that lets you leave your phone behind			1
wireless charging if you live in a household where at least a couple of people are competing for socket space to keep their smartphones , tablets , e-readers and the like charged up , things are probably already a tangled mess			0
does anybody want one more device to fit in there ? whether it 's a wireless charging pad or some new tech whipped up by @entity2 especially for its smartwatch , we 'd love to be able to just set the watch down on the nightstand and have it powered up and ready to go the next morning			1
and speaking of : battery life nobody wants a watch that they have to charge up as often as they do their phone			0
at least for now , these things are nice extras , not essential communication tools , and if they become more trouble than they 're worth , the love affair wo n't last long for even the most dedicated fanboys and fangirls			0
the smartwatches already on the market average somewhere around two or three days on a charge			0
the ones that do more , like @entity39 's @entity97 , are on the low end of that and those that do less tend to be higher			0
@entity2 is surely planning on releasing a feature - rich device			1
if it can somehow do that while figuring out how to jam a powerful battery into a tiny watch , it will be a nice selling point			0
connectivity @entity2 's smartwatch is no doubt going to link up with your @entity109 , and probably an @entity111			1
but like a lot of other major tech companies , @entity2 wants to edge its way into a lot of other areas of your life , and it sure would be cool to be able to sync those other products with your watch			1
play music on your @entity124 or @entity109 with a tap of the watch			0
change channels or pause movies on @entity129			0
@entity131 photos or videos onto your television set via @entity134			0
all those abilities would be nice			0
and @entity2 is believed to be looking into the growing " internet of things , " or connected objects such as cars and refrigerators			1
this might be a while ( and a couple of smartwatch generations ) away			2
but if you could perform home automation tasks like opening your garage , turning off your lights or locking your doors with a watch , we 'd be impressed			2
of course , it would be cool if the presumed @entity8 would link up with @entity153 devices , like those running @entity157 's @entity156 system or @entity159 's @entity158			0
but we 're not holding our breath on that			0
affordable price this is @entity2			1
so , there 's no reason to think it will depart from a model that 's always worked for them			0
unfortunately for budget - conscious consumers , that approach is to roll out finely crafted products at premium prices even while devices with similar features can be had without the @entity2 logo for less			1
but we hope this one is different			0
nobody needs a digital watch and , as mentioned above , there 's a decent chance that it wo n't even work unless you already own another , presumably pricey , @entity2 device			1
we 'd like to see it priced as an affordable accessory for your @entity109 in an effort to pull in customers who want , not need , one			2
of course , nobody needed an @entity111 either			0
more than 200 million purchases later , it feels like @entity2 knew what it was doing .			2
