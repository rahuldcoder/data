@entity0 -- @entity2 scrambled to new wife @entity4 's side moments after she was struck by a car and whispered desperate entreaties for her to live			1
but in his heart , he knew that @entity8 , 28 , would soon die			1
blood from a wound on her head was spilling onto the road , @entity2 said , and it was clear that she was seriously injured			1
" i do n't think anyone can fix this , " @entity2 told friends that morning			1
" we all know this ca n't be fixed			0
" a lawsuit filed monday in @entity22 federal court claims that the driver of the car that struck @entity8 was intoxicated , speeding and violating other traffic laws			1
but the civil suit -- which names the driver , @entity29 , and the @entity30 -- is far from open - and - shut			1
" the @entity30 is legally required to investigate traffic accidents if there is a serious injury , but their current policy is not to do so , " said a statement from @entity2 , who is a plaintiff in the case along with his late wife 's estate			1
" they canceled their investigation into the crash that killed @entity4 that very night , destroying crucial evidence , and they 've also failed to investigate hundreds of other similar cases			1
" the suit goes further , saying that rather than being a random lapse , the handling of @entity8 's case is consistent with an entrenched policy within the @entity30 of failing to meaningfully investigate cyclist and pedestrian incidents crashes except when the victim 's death is certain			1
" @entity30 systematically misclassifies vehicular crimes as ' accidents , ' creating a false appearance of declining crime rates while motorists like @entity29 escape consequences , " according to the lawsuit			1
efforts to seek comment from the department and from @entity29 have been unsuccessful			0
the @entity64 of @entity0 's law department has said they will review the case thoroughly once the legal papers are formally served			2
' likely to die ' at the heart of the issue is a seemingly simple phrase : " likely to die			1
" when traffic crashes result in death , and sometimes when death is imminent , a specialized squad within the @entity30 called the @entity75 -- trained to perform a comprehensive canvas of the scene -- is called in to investigate			1
" a sergeant or a lieutenant makes a determination after consultation with the doctors -- say , at the hospital to keep it simple -- that there is a likelihood ( of death ) , " said @entity78 , executive officer of the @entity79 , at a @entity81 hearing in february			2
" at that point , the accident investigation technicians ... respond to the location , and they begin the examination of the scene			0
" the problem , according to @entity97 , @entity2 ' attorney , is that the @entity30 has substituted a more restrictive and ill - defined standard of " likely to die			1
" " it is left to untrained officers , given no guidance as to what ' likely to die ' means , to obtain a prognosis for the victim from emergency room personnel completely engrossed in saving the victim 's life , " @entity97 said			2
meanwhile , " the decision of whether to gather and preserve evidence of how the crash occurred hangs in the balance			0
" the lawsuit says @entity29 's vehicle allegedly struck @entity8 just before 2 a.m. july 10 at an intersection in @entity22			2
" i can still hear the screech of his brakes and the sound of the impact , " said @entity2 , who was steps away but has no visual memory of the accident			2
" my friends saw the tire marks that ( the car ) left all over the road			0
" by 2:06 a.m. , an officer who had arrived on the scene , according to the lawsuit , radioed that @entity8 " may be likely " to die			2
two minutes after that , the officer asked for an @entity75 detective to respond to the scene			0
then , at 2:59 a.m. , while @entity8 was being rushed to @entity137 , the @entity75 inquiry was called off			0
" @entity138 canceled the investigation because @entity8 was still alive , " @entity97 said			0
" no doctor was at that point willing to say she was likely to die			0
" doctors later estimated that @entity8 was effectively brain dead when her head hit the pavement , so it is unclear why the @entity75 inquiry was never started , @entity2 said			1
despite that , doctors at @entity137 offered an operation to save @entity8 's life , with the caveat that her quality of life would be questionable			0
even if it succeeded , @entity2 said , it was not clear whether she would regain normal functioning			2
" the surgeon said , ' i need your guidance here , ' " he said			0
" i was asked , in other words , whether to let her die or to bear the risk of her being severely brain damaged			0
" @entity2 gave the go - ahead for the operation , but despite doctors ' efforts , @entity8 died			2
this is where the " likely to die " policy -- which is a departure from state traffic law in which an investigation is triggered , at minimum , in the event of serious injury -- becomes murky for families of victims clamoring for an investigation			0
" if @entity4 had survived that operation but come out of it severely brain damaged , what would @entity30 's position be ? " @entity2 asked			1
" that they were right to cancel their investigation since she had n't actually died ? " three days after @entity8 's death , the @entity75 opened an investigation of her case -- an act @entity2 says came way too late to collect crucial evidence			1
accidents or criminal acts ? @entity97 says that in many cases involving cyclists or pedestrians versus vehicles , deference is given to drivers , and the tendency is to treat them as accidents rather than potentially criminal acts			0
" as a civilized society , we can not classify every accident as lightning bolts from an angry @entity209 , " @entity97 said			0
" these cases have causes that are understood and have to be investigated			0
" the lack of @entity75 presence on the night of the crash meant @entity29 would probably not be criminally charged			0
" i 'm horrified that they canceled their investigation that night , " @entity2 said			2
" i 'm angry about the fact that this not only applies to @entity4 and myself , but that there seems to be a policy not to investigate violent road deaths in @entity0			0
" what @entity2 hopes to gain from the lawsuit is , of course , justice			1
but on a broader level , he wants the @entity30 to make it the rule of law to investigate these cases			1
" i want to see the law followed and for every case of serious injury or death on the road to be properly investigated , " @entity2 said			1
" i want the police to solve the crimes that people want solved			0
" bicycle injuries : is the right - of - way fight getting ugly ?			0
