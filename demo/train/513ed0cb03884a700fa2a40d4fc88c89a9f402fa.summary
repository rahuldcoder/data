sometimes called @entity40 , many consider themselves @entity42			0

the @entity102 band 's manager received emails asking them to boycott the tour			2
" if you want to interpret ( touring with an @entity2 band ) as legitimizing , that 's your interpretation ... we simply have a message that we love each other and we want to live together			1
" @entity11 and @entity10 's tour was sparked by @entity26 and @entity116 's friendship			1
" you might say ( going on tour together ) is a pr cliche or a gimmick ... but it 's simply a translation of me and @entity33 's brotherhood , " said @entity26			2

both bands blend classic heavy metal elements with @entity12 rhythms and instruments like violins and flutes			0
" we take the rock ' n roll of the @entity65 , put it through our @entity128 filters , and throw it back , " said @entity33			0
@entity10 's lyrics are often political , observing the @entity128 's governments and religion			1
@entity11 ' latest album features metal covers of ' 80s @entity4 wedding songs			2
" @entity11 does n't deal with politics ... it 's not because we are not connected to our people or we do n't care , but there are so many people talking about the occupation			0
" i have the right to write about having fun and love and drinking beer			0
" in spite of the complexities , @entity161 author of " playing across a divide : @entity2 - @entity42 musical encounters " and a professor of music at @entity169 , says something very interesting can happen when musicians from both sides come together			1
" they create different kinds of musical styles ; it 's giving a vision of a rich kind of working together ( that in ) the best cases creates something new , something that they could n't create on their own , that can speak to the hearts of diverse audiences			0
" for @entity26 , it 's straightforward enough : " the only conflict we have is who is going to pay the bill			1

two @entity2 bands -- one @entity3 the other @entity4 -- touring @entity15 together
bands hope their tour will show how music can unite people across political and religious divides
other @entity4 - @entity2 musical projects have *highlighted* power of music to foster peaceful relations
