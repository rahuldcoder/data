-- @entity2 has issued a rare statement of " regret " for the recent deaths of several @entity1 security personnel , hours after @entity1 said it was recalling its ambassador			1
@entity1 's government posted a statement saturday saying its ambassador would be withdrawn until @entity2 conducted an investigation into what it called " indiscriminate shelling " that led to the deaths of at least three security forces in its @entity16 region on thursday			1
later in the day , the statement was taken down without explanation			0
top - level @entity2 security officials met saturday with @entity2 defense minister @entity20 , who quickly issued a statement vowing that @entity2 would conduct a military investigation , followed by a joint examination with the @entity1 military , of the incident			1
" we regret the deaths of members of the @entity1 security forces during the terror attack on the @entity2 - @entity1 border , " @entity20 said			1
" the @entity31 has great importance and much strategic value for the stability of the @entity35			0
" the tense situation between @entity2 and @entity1 comes amid heightened tensions in the region following @entity2 strikes in @entity40 after a series of attacks in southern @entity2 on thursday that targeted buses , cars and soldiers			2
an @entity1 military official said @entity2 forces may have been targeting militants near @entity1 's border with @entity40 when they struck and killed the @entity1 security personnel			1
on saturday , the @entity51 -- the @entity52 , the @entity53 , @entity54 , and the @entity55 -- condemned thursday 's " premeditated terrorism " attacks on @entity2 , and warned that it remains concerned about the situation in @entity40			0
it also expressed concern about the security situation in @entity1 's @entity61			1
" recent commitments by the @entity1 government to address the security situation in the @entity16 are important , and the quartet encourages the @entity1 government to find a lasting resolution to the issue of @entity16 security , " it said			1
no one in @entity2 's armed forces intentionally acted to harm @entity1 security personnel , @entity73 , a defense official involved in maintaining @entity2 's relationship with the @entity1 military , told @entity76 on saturday			1
he also stressed the strategic importance of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries			0
outside the @entity2 embassy in @entity82 , hundreds of demonstrators gathered saturday to protest the killings and demand @entity1 sever its ties with @entity2			2
@entity1 state - run tv showed protesters burning @entity2 flags and chanting " @entity1 blood is not cheap			2
" @entity2 believes that the attacks had their roots in @entity40 , but were coming out of the neighboring @entity1 region of @entity16			2
" the @entity1 control over @entity16 is weakening and this is probably the reason that this attack that originated in @entity40 has made it all the way down here , " @entity20 said thursday			2
the @entity1 claims of @entity2 forces killing three of its security members and injuring four surfaced thursday , the same day @entity2 launched airstrikes on @entity40			2
senior @entity1 military and security forces told @entity0 that two members of the @entity106 and one military officer were killed in clashes east of @entity109 , 13 kilometers north of @entity110			1
at the time , an @entity2 helicopter was in the area chasing militants in the aftermath of the attacks on @entity2 , said gen. @entity116 , head of security in @entity118			0
" the @entity2 ground troops engaged with armed militants 200 meters from the @entity1 border which may have also led to casualties on the @entity1 side , " said lt. col. @entity119 , the @entity1 army spokesman			0
" we have reinforced our border guards and raised the level of alert			0
" the rising tensions also come as questions are being raised in @entity2 about the @entity1 military presence in the demilitarized zone in @entity16 , which was created under the terms of the @entity133 signed in 1978 between @entity1 and @entity2			1
since the overthrow of @entity1 dictator @entity136 , the security situation in @entity16 has deteriorated			1
senior @entity1 officials said several weeks ago that more than 23,000 prisoners escaped from prisons in @entity1 in late january and february because of the breakdown in regime authority			0
additionally , travel between @entity1 and @entity40 has become much easier since the @entity143 reopened the border crossing at @entity145 in late may			0
but along with traders -- and @entity148 just wanting a break from their cramped sliver of territory -- there are signs that @entity154 groups are taking advantage of weaker security			0
the crossing is the only land passage out of @entity40 not directly under @entity2 control			0
@entity1 claims it has been cracking down on terror groups in its portion of the @entity16 , exchanging fire with militants on its side of the border			0
" the security at border has not been affected by the revolution , and no one from @entity1 has crossed through to conduct the attacks on @entity2 , " said @entity166 , the governor of @entity16 , an @entity1 province			1
he said the distance between where the @entity1 forces were attacked and the border of @entity1 was too far to allow the sort of attack against the @entity2 that sparked the strikes on @entity40			2
@entity0 's @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and journalist @entity184 contributed to this report			0
