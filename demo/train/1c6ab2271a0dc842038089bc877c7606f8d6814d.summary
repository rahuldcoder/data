-- a seventh person has been confirmed dead , and the number of presumed dead is now up to three after last week 's flooding in @entity5 , authorities reported thursday			1
the state @entity7 added a new confirmed fatality in @entity10 to the list thursday afternoon , spokeswoman @entity6 said			1
and in @entity12 , a 46 - year - old man from the town of @entity15 whose home had been washed away was reclassified as presumed dead , said @entity17 , executive officer of the county sheriff 's office			1
two other people in @entity12 -- both women , ages 60 and 80 -- were already presumed dead after their homes were swept away in the flash floods that ravaged @entity5 's northern @entity23			1
another 139 people remain unaccounted for in @entity12 , a figure reduced from nearly 200 on wednesday , @entity17 said			0
officials say most of those unaccounted for are expected to be alive and well , but have failed to check in with authorities to let them know			0
the mountains north of @entity28 saw more than nine inches of rain on september 12 -- leading to flash floods that turned picturesque canyons into funnels that deluged towns downstream and left hundreds stranded in the mountains above			2
nearly 1,200 people had been airlifted out of the mountains by thursday , and @entity17 said nearly 200 more have chosen to stay in their homes			0
in addition to the deaths , nearly 18,000 homes have been damaged statewide			0
gov. @entity42 told reporters that about 200 miles of state highways washed out by the storms will need to be fixed , along with perhaps " several times more " miles of local roads			1
how to help those roads are not only in hard - hit @entity10 and @entity12 counties but in farm communities northeast of @entity28 , where the runoff from the storms was carried downstream by the @entity52			2
and he added , " it 's clear we 're in a race against the onset of winter			2
" " critical roads needed to bring in crops that are about to go to harvest are completely broken apart , " @entity42 said			0
" this has to be every bit as critical a priority as the roads connecting people with their communities and homes in the canyons			0
@entity69 , in large measure , has been washed away along the @entity52			0
" the disaster may end up costing homeowners , businesses and local governments nearly $ 2 billion , according to the insurance consulting firm @entity74 -- and a high percentage of the losses will not be covered by insurance			1
@entity78 , senior vice president of of @entity74 , said that because very many of the homes damaged by the flooding are not in flood plains , the number of people with federal flood coverage is very low			0
@entity5 is also an oil - producing state , and the disaster has raised concerns that hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " fluids used in oil and gas wells may have been swept up in the floodwaters and washed into the environment			1
@entity5 's @entity96 , the industry 's trade association , said no fracking operations were underway when the floods hit -- meaning " no fracking fluids , no chemicals associated with fracking , nor equipment were on sites at the time of the flooding			1
" but state inspectors reported 10 oil spills as of thursday , including two the @entity108 called " notable " -- a 125 - barrel ( 3,900 - gallon ) leak from a storage tank south of @entity111 , near the @entity52 ; and a 323 - barrel ( 13,500 gallon ) leak from another storage tank near @entity114 , on the @entity115			1
" in both cases , it appears the oil left the site in floodwaters , " the commission reported			0
it said the spills were " promptly reported " by the tanks ' owners , @entity125 , and @entity125 said it was working with state and federal officials " to clean up the releases to the greatest extent possible			2
" and the state agency noted that oil is typically a small portion of the contaminants associated with a flood : " those include very large volumes ( millions of gallons ) of raw , municipal sewage and other hazards associated with households , agriculture , business and industry			2
" what we learned from @entity147 's epic flood @entity0 correspondent @entity148 and @entity150 's @entity149 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
