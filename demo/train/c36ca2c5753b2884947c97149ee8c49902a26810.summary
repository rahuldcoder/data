journalist @entity0 has written a new book about our dysfunctional system of health care and it 's getting a lot of attention			1
in " @entity9 's @entity8 : money , @entity15 , @entity16 , and the fight to fix our @entity18 , " he describes the various struggles to implement the @entity11 and dissects the ongoing opposition to the bill			2
as a nurse , i 've always supported the @entity11 as a way for more @entity9 to get needed health care			1
but many people , including many nurses , view @entity11 as a government intrusion into individual lives			1
i can see their point of view , but i believe it 's mistaken			2
the @entity11 does not allow government to interfere in our lives ; it compels government to keep us as safe and healthy as possible			1
for the record , the @entity11 was based on " @entity35 , " the market - based health insurance reform that @entity38 @entity37 put in place when he was governor of @entity40			2
the @entity11 , like @entity35 , prohibits insurance companies from excluding patients due to preexisting conditions , requires all individuals to buy insurance ( since otherwise only the sick would sign up for coverage and the system would quickly become insolvent ) and offers subsidies to middle - class and low - income families to make higher - quality coverage affordable			2
despite its @entity38 provenance and utilization of private insurance companies , though , the " government takeover " label stuck to the @entity11			2
in his book , @entity0 explains that the phrase " government takeover of health care " came from conservative pollster @entity62 and became a rallying cry for the enemies of the @entity11 who said @entity11 would deny @entity9 free choice over health insurance			1
" free choice " is a tricky phrase here , because the @entity11 does curtail insurance choices , in that it disallows low - cost policies that do n't provide anything close to real coverage of health care costs			1
but the only @entity9 who really had free choice over their health care prior to the implementation of @entity11 were those with excellent insurance or unlimited funds of their own			1
consider @entity0 's story of his own aortic aneurysm and how glad he was to end up at @entity82 , one of @entity85 's flagship hospital systems			2
there , he was operated on by an @entity87 with an impeccable record in the exact surgical repair @entity0 needed			2
his hospital stay offered " @entity96 care , " and though his total bill came to $ 190,000 , his insurance paid for the bulk of it			0
now consider @entity97 , who 's profiled in @entity0 's book : a 42 - year - old , non-hodgkin lymphoma patient from @entity100 , @entity101 , with health insurance that , @entity0 specifies , provided minimal reimbursement for health care costs			1
@entity97 had to pay @entity105 in @entity106 $ 83,900 in advance in order to begin treatment there			0
@entity105 is a great hospital and i 'm sure @entity97 also received @entity96 care , but the upfront cost was enormous and the @entity114 are not rich			0
the treatment he received did save his life , but it was obviously not free or freely chosen ; his life was at stake and he believed @entity105 would save him			0
contrasting these anecdotes gets to the nub of the problem with health care : when people 's lives are at stake -- as @entity0 's and @entity97 's both were -- survival becomes much more important than cost			1
but cost of care can vary dramatically depending largely on whether someone has insurance and what the quality of that insurance is			0
the @entity11 was intended to reduce those price disparities by better standardizing what insurance covers and what it costs , making it possible for more @entity9 to get the health care they need			1
the bill is complicated and imperfect , but it has created a much fairer system of health insurance than we had before			2
@entity0 , however , says the @entity11 does not go far enough in terms of controlling overall costs and improving quality			1
right now , the @entity9 pays much more for health care than any other developed country and we have worse health outcomes overall			1
the @entity11 regulates insurance companies , but does not limit the huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies , device manufacturers or hospital administrators			0
that 's because the @entity11 would not have passed without the support of those three groups			0
to corral those industries and really make @entity9 health care better , cheaper and fairer will probably require government intervention			1
i say that because every developed country that has some version of national health care uses government regulation to control access and set prices			1
any move in that direction in the @entity9 , though , would bring further accusations of " socialized medicine " and stoke the " government takeover " fire			0
this is why i say we 're focusing on the wrong thing -- on principles instead of lives			0
and i came to that conclusion by thinking back to my own father			0
a country boy from @entity185 , @entity186 , with the gumption to become a philosophy professor , my dad deeply resents " @entity191 " lights in cars			0
" it 's the government telling me how to drive ! " was his common complaint			0
but it 's also true that seat belts save lives when automobiles crash , and @entity9 have acclimated ourselves to wearing seat belts and acknowledging their value			0
@entity11 then , may not effectively control health care costs in the long term , but the part of it that has made insurance newly affordable for millions of @entity9 is not an attempt to control people 's lives , but to save them : a seat belt for travelers on our unbelievably expensive , miracle - delivering , health care highway			1
but do n't take my word for it			0
rely instead on @entity217 , governor of @entity218 , quoted in @entity8 describing his state 's @entity11 exchange , called @entity221 : " just have a look			0
it 's not about me or president @entity225			0
