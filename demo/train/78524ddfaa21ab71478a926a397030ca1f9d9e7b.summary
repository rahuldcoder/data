-- @entity2 's president @entity1 looks more isolated with each passing day as his regime continues a bloody eight - month crackdown on pro-democracy protests			1
his @entity7 neighbors signaled their displeasure with him this week by suspending @entity2 from the @entity9 , a stinging blow for a nation that sees itself at the heart of @entity7 concerns			1
@entity15 's @entity14 went a step further , telling the @entity17 he would step down if he were @entity1 , an unusually blunt assessment that followed @entity20 calls for @entity1 to go			2
and @entity21 , formerly an important ally and trading partner , threatened to cut off electricity supplies to @entity2 as the @entity24 moved this week to extend sanctions against more members of @entity1 's circle			1
this week , the conflict inside @entity2 entered a new era when army defectors attacked pro-government targets			1
that ratcheted up the pressure even more -- the @entity35 foreign minister was widely quoted as saying attacks on government buildings in @entity2 resembled " civil war			1
" so can @entity1 cling to power ? or will he become the fourth leader forced from office in the @entity42 , following in the footsteps of ousted leaders of @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 ? analysts say that the odds are stacked against @entity2 's president			1
@entity51 , @entity52 senior fellow for @entity54 studies at the @entity55 , said it is hard to predict what might come next for @entity1 -- but the pressure is on			0
" the kind of traditional support he had externally is clearly crumbling , " @entity51 said			0
" his prospects this week are worse than they were last week			2
" @entity63 , senior fellow for regional security at the @entity66 office of the @entity67 , thinks it highly unlikely @entity1 will hang on to power			2
three main factors will likely contribute to the downfall of @entity2 's president after 11 years in power , he said			1
one is that he has lost legitimacy in the eyes of his own people			0
" it 's hard to see how he would recover his legitimacy after killing almost 4,000 of his countrymen , " said @entity63			2
the @entity79 puts the toll of deaths at well over 3,500 since protests began			0
@entity83 is the economy , as sanctions imposed by the @entity86 and @entity21 start to bite			1
this matters , said @entity63 , because @entity1 may struggle to keep the support of the country 's urban and business elites in @entity92 and @entity93 if the economy is failing			0
the third factor is security , despite @entity1 's mobilization of the military			0
unlike previous challenges to the @entity1 regime , " this time it 's the @entity2 people leading it and very clearly regime change is their goal and they are not going to accept anything less , " @entity63 said			1
@entity106 , an associate fellow at the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , also doubts @entity1 will survive -- but says it is far from clear what might follow			0
the @entity9 's decision to suspend @entity2 , after @entity92 failed to abide by a peace deal that had been brokered earlier with the 22 - nation league , signals a shift in views that would have looked extremely unlikely even a month ago , he says			1
the regime 's military is also increasingly over-extended as those fighting against it find footholds in @entity121 and @entity21 soil , he said			0
@entity21 might also choose to intervene more directly , perhaps by creating a buffer zone along its long border with @entity2 or providing weapons to the rebels , he said			1
at this point , descent into civil war could be as likely a scenario as a clean change of regime at the top , he said			0
nonetheless , @entity106 cautioned against thinking the 46 - year - old 's grip on power will be loosened immediately , pointing to the example of @entity138 's former dictator , @entity137			1
in 1991 , he said , @entity137 had just lost a major war , had two no - fly zones , @entity79 sanctions and an oil embargo imposed on his country , was facing an enormous @entity145 uprising in the south , and endured overwhelming diplomatic isolation			0
" and yet he survived for 12 years , " @entity106 said			0
" regimes that are used to being isolated , that are used to being under sanctions and under pressure , can be extremely resilient			0
" @entity106 also points out that while @entity1 may well be forced out , that does n't necessarily mean the regime will fall with him			0
@entity1 is not as well entrenched as was his father , the late president @entity154 , who ruled with an iron fist for three decades -- and it 's possible other members of his ruling @entity160 sect might decide to throw their hat in with his brother @entity162 , an army commander , or parts of the military instead , @entity106 said			1
" they might even decide to get rid of @entity1 to save themselves , and portray it as a concession , or compromise , " he said			0
he cites the example of @entity45 , where the @entity42 uprising may have forced president @entity173 from power in february but the military leadership has not yet handed over power to a democratically elected government			1
@entity178 , director of the @entity179 , also predicts that @entity1 will eventually go -- but that his regime will cling on for as long as possible , with @entity2 following the example of @entity46 rather than that of @entity47 , where ousted president @entity183 @entity182 fled to @entity184			1
@entity178 sees " the makings of a very powerful coalition " lined up against @entity1 , uniting the @entity7 nations , @entity21 , the @entity186 and @entity187 , which could move " quite forcefully " to sanctions			1
and @entity1 has few friends to whom he can turn for help			0
one key question is how long @entity2 can still count on the support of @entity35 , a historic ally and a major arms supplier to @entity92			1
@entity198 , which sold $ 3.8 billion of weapons to @entity2 last year -- 10 % of its total arms sales , is " giving a lifeline " to @entity1 at the moment , said @entity178 , largely by delaying international action			2
if @entity198 opposes efforts to impose @entity210 sanctions on @entity2 , as anticipated , international efforts to present a unified stance -- as on @entity206 action to protect civilians in @entity46 -- will be thwarted			2
" the same action can be viewed as a just war or an act of imperial aggression depending on whether @entity35 allows a @entity79 resolution to be passed , " @entity106 said			0
@entity217 , @entity219 and @entity220 will hand in a draft @entity79 resolution thursday condemning the @entity2 government 's actions , a @entity217 diplomatic spokesman in @entity218 told @entity0 on wednesday			1
diplomats from @entity7 countries are considering co-sponsoring the resolution			2
an attempt this week by a @entity2 opposition group to persuade @entity35 officials to shift their position and demand @entity1 's resignation appears to have gone nowhere , with @entity198 instead reiterating a call for peaceful dialogue to resolve the situation			1
@entity236 also has a history of opposing @entity79 action but appears at the moment to be hedging its bets on @entity2 , probably in the interests of stability in the region , @entity106 added			2
@entity244 has in the past few days given a strong statement of support for @entity1 , @entity178 of the @entity179 said , but @entity248 may still in the end be pragmatic and seek to build ties with the @entity2 opposition			2
perhaps the biggest danger ahead , the analysts say , is that whether @entity1 goes or not , @entity2 is teetering on the brink of civil war , as opposition elements such as the @entity257 turn to arms to combat pro-government forces			1
such violence lessens the chance of a peaceful resolution to the uprising and smooth shift to democracy -- and will undoubtedly lead to greater loss of life			0
" we are entering into a new phase now in the @entity2 situation , " said @entity178			2
" we are seeing a greater militarization			0
" i think the window for an orderly transition is over and now it will be a mixture of international pressure and whatever support is given to these protesters and even those fighting against the regime			0
" the main game for the foreseeable future will focus on the protection of civilians , and measures to ensure that , as we saw in the @entity46 case			0
" @entity0 's @entity288 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity42 has forced three leaders from power so far
@entity2 's president could go , too , some analysts say
*unrest* that has *roiled* @entity2 for months took a turn this week
@entity2 's @entity7 neighbors have *joined* the @entity86 in *criticizing* the @entity2 leader
