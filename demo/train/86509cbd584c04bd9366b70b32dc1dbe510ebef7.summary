the conflict between humans and critically endangered @entity3 elephants in @entity4 has been going on for decades , with the elephants on the losing end of the battle			1
the villagers and farmers do n't kill them for food			1
they do it to keep their homes and crops safe			0
the grim result is the killing combined with shrinking elephant habitat contributes to an 80 % population loss since the 1930s , according to the @entity20			1
in @entity22 alone , where the highest number of elephants on the island was recorded in the 1980s , the population decreased from 1,342 in 1984 to 201 in 2007			1
the major contributor to this conflict is the fight over land			1
elephant habitat is lowland , non-mountainous , relatively flat landscape below an altitude of 300 meters			0
that kind of land also makes great farmland , which is why humans have cut down the rainforest and planted crops			1
individual small farms may not seem like a big encroachment onto elephant habitat , but when that 's combined with the forest loss from large companies cutting down hundreds of hectares of forest for palm oil and pulp and paper plantations , it results in the elephants running out of land			1

with a weight of up to 4,000 kg or 8,820 pounds and a height of up to 3.2 meters or 10 feet and 6 inches , these elephants are n't small and they need a lot of land to roam			1
even forest blocks of 250 km are too small for a viable elephant population			2
that means , as the elephant habitat is whittled away , the elephants will inevitably intrude onto villages and farms looking for food			1
one of their favorite foods is heart of palm , the same heart of palm we eat , which can be found in the center core of an oil palm tree			0
to get to it , an elephant has to knock the tree down , killing a farmer 's valuable crop			2
oil palm is one of the most lucrative crops @entity3 farmers can grow			1
even one elephant can be a destructive force , knocking down trees and trampling houses in minutes			0
a 3.2 meter tall , 4,000 kilo animal can be intimidating for any human , no matter how well armed			0
to make it even scarier , the animals usually look for food at night			2
a villager or farmer will do anything to stop the elephant from its path of destruction			2
the most common way of killing the elephants in these areas of @entity108 is poisoning			2
villagers and farmers will poison a bit of food and leave it for the elephant			2
it eliminates a direct confrontation			0
the local population does n't want to kill the elephants			1
they feel as if they have no choice			0
in fact , some of the locals say they take pride in the @entity3 elephant and consider it part of their national identity			1
no villager or farmer thinks that killing one elephant threatening his home will wipe out the entire population			2
unfortunately , the sad truth is , this killing is wiping out the population			2
read more : @entity4 's indigenous villages in flux ngos like the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) are working to change the way locals interact with elephants			1
they introduced the @entity22 province villagers and farmers to alternatives to killing the elephants			1
the @entity141 created scare guns that make a loud boom that will scare the elephants away			0
there are also barriers that will sound an alarm when an elephant trips a wire			0
@entity141 has even helped locals install an electric fence that borders @entity160 or @entity160 , which is protected land for wildlife			0
one of the most important elements of these successful projects is the education and cooperation of the local population			0
these non-lethal alternatives use cheap materials that are easily found in the area , so they catch on quickly			0
the locals have built lookout stations and formed a group like an elephant community watch that will gather when elephants are nearby so they can scare them away with loud noises and large fires			0
the @entity141 programs have been so successful in their efforts to keep the elephants from being killed , they 've expanded their operation			0
now , they have tagged some of the elephants with radio devices so they can track their movements and organize groups to scare the elephants away even more quickly			0
these are small victories in a few rural communities around @entity108 , but they can have a big impact			0
if the killing can be stopped and the cutting of the forest limited , this tiny population of critically endangered @entity3 elephants might have a chance to beat extinction .			1

the population of @entity3 elephants has decreased by 80 % since the 1930s .
in @entity22 alone the population decreased from 1,342 in 1984 to 201 in 2007 .
humans kill the elephants to keep them off valuable farming land .
the destruction of the rainforest means elephants *increasingly* intrude on villages and farms looking for food .
