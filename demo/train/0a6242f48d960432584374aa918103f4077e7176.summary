@entity0 -- home is the hardest place to find for children of immigrants , but for us , nothing hits closer to home than when a bomb goes off in @entity10			1
last week , just days after @entity13 troops pulled out of @entity14 , 63 people died and 176 were wounded in @entity10			1
as the son of @entity14 who left home in the late ' 70s , i find fleeting moments of hope that seldom return to me			1
the withering memories of my last visit to @entity22 play like broken records in my mind			2
i remember our grandparents ' home , my uncle 's dog and the size of the tires on his jeep			0
i remember the smell distinctly but i ca n't put it into words			0
i remember feeling small ; after all i was only 5			0
i have watched @entity14 's tragedies only through television or the internet for more than 20 years now			1
we make frantic fuzzy phone calls to @entity14 , the voices on the other end are lost in reception ; there is no awe in their shock			1
my aunt said that it felt like " hell opened loose " this past thursday , heat lingering in the air as it rose from the rubble and twisted metal around @entity10			1
the violence follows @entity14 ' sense of security like the ghost of @entity59 past			1
as we hang up the phone with our families , we are all wondering : where do we go from here ? with troops reaching home in time for the holidays , many are asking why they were there in the first place ? we should have asked ourselves these questions many years ago			2
my cousin grew up with my grandparents in @entity14			1
as a child of the late eighties , he saw war for much of two decades coming out of their front door			2
i had the privilege of a selfish teenage rebellion in @entity0 , as a voyeur into the war , watching news on our television			2
in the process , we were both detached from each other 's realities			0
we spent some time together in the @entity86 , after my maternal family had the rare opportunity to leave @entity14 in 2005 , drained by the successive wars pounding on their chests			1
the decades of bombings had taken its toll , far too often carrying bad news to those in the diaspora , sending ripples back through the hearts of all @entity14			1
those same bombs did something to my cousin			2
one night , we sat down and watched a movie together , something i had never done with him before			0
as a car exploded on the screen , his immediate reflex was to cover his ears and close his eyes			0
he was transported back home , and i was lost			0
the contrast in our perspectives on life riddled me with guilt			0
some of us take so much for granted			0
i switched the tv off			0
in the @entity121 area of @entity10 , a local women 's @entity118 is offering an awareness seminar for widows			1
my sister - in - law returned from @entity10 last week , with pictures from the seminar			1
most of the mothers and daughters , sometimes both widowed , lost their husbands in violence in 2007 and 2008			0
what is left of their homes is a fragmented family structure , compounded with the damage from decades of sanctions and mass exodus , lack of infrastructure , broken education systems and bouts of political corruption			2
i could n't help but think about the future of the forgotten children of @entity14			1
that is what war is to me			0
war is the leftover pain in our hearts and souls			1
that detachment from home ; trying to reach for safety			0
as @entity14 ran home from the violence and explosions in neighborhoods such as @entity160 , they could n't cover their ears and eyes			1
there is no remote control for @entity10			1
most of your returning soldiers still feel that pain in their hearts			0
nothing good came out of this war			0
there is no victory in any violence			0
with staggering body counts surfacing , and a possible link to rising cancer and birth defect rates , where do you start looking for justice ? where do we stand as an international body of people , looking for a new , positive outlook on our future ? what a year			0
we 've streamed so - called leaders ' deaths in @entity189 on our cell phones , become obsessed with @entity191 and our children are playing @entity193 holding the fate of digital @entity195 in their little hands			0
movies are being made about @entity14 as the news unfolds , blurring the lines of reality			1
the problems this generation are facing feel so big , you start feeling powerless			0
sometimes , i still feel small when i think of @entity14			2
where do @entity14 go next ? @entity14 's chance at a " spring " was robbed and their neighbors are losing balance			2
whatever you do @entity13 , remember them in your prayers this @entity213 season with your kids			2
as the children of @entity10 ask , " when will the war really be over ? " there is always hope in our youth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

days after *departure* of @entity13 troops , bombs killed and injured scores of people in @entity10
@entity224 , whose family is from @entity14 , says the pain of the war is far from over
he says his *relatives* live with the *grieving* , the memories and the loss every day
