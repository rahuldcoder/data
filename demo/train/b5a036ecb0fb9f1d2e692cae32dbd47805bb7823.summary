-- in an attempt to be frugal amid the economic downturn , @entity1 and his family in @entity3 , @entity4 , planned to skip their annual trip to @entity9			1
@entity10 rushes toward the shore at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity9			1
that is until @entity1 began noticing airfare and hotel rates plunge this year			2
last week , he caved , purchasing plane tickets for less than $ 450 a person , a sweet deal compared with $ 600 last year			2
he booked rooms at @entity21 , among the emerald mountains in @entity23 , for 25 percent off , and he was delighted to receive one of the nights free			2
" we might have done something on the mainland , something more low - key , but the fact that it was inexpensive was a big factor for us to go again , " said @entity1 , who is taking his wife and two young boys in may			0
outdoor enthusiasts , lovebirds and families prudently resisting the urge to visit @entity9 , say aloha to majorly discounted airfares and hotel rates -- many hitting rock - bottom prices -- this year			1
the bittersweet theory seems to hold true : what is bad for the travel industry has been good for consumers			0
as @entity9 suffers from its biggest visitor decline since the @entity48 , the state is enticing travelers with discounted deals to offset the toll on its local economy			1
ireport.com : toughing out the recession ? airfare to @entity9 from cities in the continental @entity57 has plummeted more than 30 percent in some markets , according to @entity59 , an airfare research web site			1
@entity61 , one of the nation 's largest privately owned travel companies , is offering vacation packages that include flight and three nights hotel stay in @entity69 starting at $ 299			2
online travel giants @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 are all offering sales on @entity9 flights , hotels and activities , and some luxury hotels have rooms for less than $ 150 a night			1
" you wo n't see prices to @entity9 like this again in your lifetime , " @entity81 ceo @entity80 said			1
" it might be worth it to take that once - in - a - lifetime trip			0
" for decades , tourists from the @entity57 and abroad have flocked to @entity9 , many captivated by the exotic islands ' natural beauty : snow - capped mountains , active volcanoes , breathtaking waterfalls and pristine beaches			1
now with the administration of president @entity99 , who spent part of his childhood in @entity9 , there is a renewed interest for tourists to visit , travel experts say			1
but travelers have long viewed @entity9 as an expensive destination in comparison with @entity107 or @entity108			1
two adults can expect to spend $ 673 a day in @entity13 on food and lodging , making @entity9 the most expensive destination in the country , according to the @entity114			1
it is no surprise , then , that in a brutal economy where consumer confidence is low , the islands are having a tough time reeling in visitors , despite discounted prices			2
the state reported a 12.4 percent decline in visitors , or 72,255 fewer guests , in january compared with the same time last year			1
the drop , which started last spring , is a reversal of nearly a decade of visitor growth			0
to make matters worse , visitor spending in @entity9 declined by 13.6 percent in january , and many state officials and experts are worried what that will mean for a state where tourism is the backbone industry			1
nationwide , the tourism picture looks bleak , as the number of travelers is expected to fall throughout 2009 , according to the @entity142			2
in the @entity9 , the smaller , more remote islands like @entity144 and @entity145 are feeling the most pain			2
they received about a third fewer visitors in january than the year before			2
" this is a downturn , " said @entity149 , who sits on the board of the @entity151 of @entity9 and is ceo of @entity153			2
@entity149 explained that the decline in visitors may be troubling , but the numbers are still as strong as they were a decade ago			2
" it 's not a catastrophe			0
the clock has been wound back			0
" signs of decline for @entity9 began last spring with the shutdown of @entity164 and @entity165 , which held about a fifth of the market share			1
by the summer , fuel prices had skyrocketed to $ 135 a barrel , which drove fares to an unaffordable price point for many travelers			0
that same year , @entity173 's @entity173 pulled back stops to @entity9			1
@entity174 , the president of @entity175 , said he noticed about 3,000 fewer customers after some of the cruise ships stopped coming			0
the company , which gives natural tours of the island , said things " just kind of deteriorated , and it was more difficult to fill seats			0
" another challenge @entity9 faces in terms of tourism is its remote location on an archipelago in the @entity189			1
this makes the state 's tourism industry highly dependent on airfare prices			1
ireport.com : where 's your favorite secret hideaway ? traditionally , economical travelers shy away from @entity9 because of the high flight cost , travel experts said			1
but the airfare prices being offered until june show that prices may be more affordable than most leisure travelers think			0
a flight from @entity205 , @entity206 , on @entity207 , @entity208 or @entity209 is running about $ 461 round trip , down from $ 610 at the same time last year , according to @entity59			0
travelers from major @entity215 cities such as @entity216 , @entity108 , can find flights just under $ 340 , nearly 30 percent off the ticket price from a year ago , the site reported			1
adding to the vacation savings are hotels , including lavish resorts , advertising rates about 20 percent lower in the first quarter of 2009 compared with first - quarter 2008 , according to online travel companies			0
hotels scrambled to offer lower rates when they saw occupancy numbers dive for the first time in years			0
hotels say that in addition to the discount on the rooms , there are perks and added value such as upgrades , free nights and dinner coupons , travel experts say			0
for example , @entity220 , owned by @entity239 , is offering the third night free for travelers who book a stay in @entity243 this month for $ 159 a night			0
a year ago , the lowest the rate at the hotel was nearly $ 100 more			0
" you can travel better than you have in the past for the same amount of money , " said @entity246 , an @entity71 travel expert			0
" or you could do the exact same thing as last year and save money			0
" travelers can also snatch bargains at condos and rental properties			0
this is particularly true on the islands of @entity260 and @entity69 , where there has been major development in recent years , says @entity263 , creator of the @entity264			2
" you can play ' let 's make a deal ' with these folks , " said @entity263 , who has been tracking the travel industry for almost 20 years			1
" they are desperate for people 's business			0
" but do n't expect the deals to paradise to last forever			0
prices will climb during peak summer season and as soon as the economy recovers			0
though experts are unsure when recovery will happen , @entity9 's @entity278 , @entity277 predicts that wo n't be until 2011			1
in the meantime , @entity9 tourism groups want to change @entity57 and international travelers ' impression that a trip there is too expensive			1
with @entity291 suffering from its own economic woes , arrivals of @entity291 tourists , once a steady revenue stream , have slowed , travel experts said			0
" the difficulty is the fact that it 's not a @entity9 - centered problem , " said @entity294 , president of the @entity295			1
