-- the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest ever on @entity1 according to data released by scientists at @entity4			0
the @entity7 space agency 's data also revealed that 2009 was the second warmest year since temperature records began in 1880 , and only narrowly cooler than 2005 , the warmest year ever			1
2008 was the coolest year of the decade but this was attributed to a strong @entity11 which causes extensive cooling of the central and eastern @entity13			2
@entity15 , director of @entity4 's @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said in a statement : " there 's substantial year - to - year variability of global temperature caused by the tropical @entity22 - @entity11 cycle			0
when we average temperature over five or ten years to minimize that variability , we find global warming is continuing unabated			0
" in the past three decades , @entity16 report surface temperature records show an upward trend of about 0.2 degrees @entity30 ( 0.36 degrees @entity29 ) per decade			1
in total , according to @entity16 , average global temperatures have increased by about 0.8 degrees @entity30 ( 1.5 degrees @entity29 ) since 1880			1
@entity16 sources its data using over one thousand weather stations around the world , satellite observations of sea surface temperatures , and research station data from @entity41 -- all of which , they say , is readily available to the public .			0

2000 to 2009 was the warmest decade since records began
2005 was warmest year of all time , 2008 coolest in decade
global temperatures have risen 0.8 degrees @entity30 since 1880
