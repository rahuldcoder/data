-- it 's the question that everyone has been asking -- and now @entity3 is ready to give us the answer			1
just what happened on december 2 , 2010 when football 's world governing body @entity3 decided to award the 2018 @entity10 to @entity11 and the 2022 tournament to @entity13 might be about to be revealed ... or not			1
the world governing body says it will publish a redacted version of @entity17 's report into the alleged wrongdoing surrounding the 2018 and 2022 bidding process			1
the move came following a two - day meeting of the organization 's executive committee in @entity24 , @entity25			1
what will we find out ? possibly not a lot more to be honest			0
the report can not be published until legal proceedings against five men facing charges from the ethics committee have been concluded			1
three members of the committee -- @entity37 's @entity36 ­ a @entity38 , @entity39 , of @entity40 and @entity42 's @entity41 -- were being investigated by @entity17 for either alleged code breaches during the bidding process or for failing to comply with his probe			1
@entity47 , who led the inspection team visiting the candidates to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and former @entity52 @entity10 winner @entity51 are also facing charges from the @entity3 ethics committee which both men have denied			1
@entity55 also confirmed that @entity17 has been replaced by his deputy , @entity57 © ly , who he describes as " an outstanding lawyer			1
" what has been the hold up ? @entity3 had always maintained that it could not publish the full report , compiled by independent investigator @entity17 , because it would break witness confidentiality			1
but it turned out that not everybody agreed -- and neither did @entity64 , @entity3 's head of compliance			1
@entity66 , the president of @entity70 football 's governing body @entity68 , and @entity71 , the head of @entity72 had both been advocates of publishing the report			0
several leading figures such as vice-president @entity76 , who told @entity78 newspaper @entity77 that @entity3 must take this " massive " opportunity to restore the public 's trust in the organization			1
the report created tensions within the football world when @entity17 said it should be published last september			1
@entity3 did n't like that at all ; his request was rejected and it came close to disciplining the @entity89 lawyer for speaking out , according to @entity17			1
instead , last month , @entity91 - @entity90 , a @entity3 judge , published a 42 - page summary of the report -- only for @entity17 to respond immediately by claiming the @entity52 's publication contained " numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations			1
" @entity90 's summary cleared @entity11 and @entity13 of any wrongdoing			1
when @entity17 appealed against @entity90 's findings he was told his complaint was inadmissible			2
that was a decision which prompted the @entity102 attorney to quit his role and launch a fierce attack on @entity3 , accusing it of a " lack of leadership			1
" aside from the politics , the @entity10 is big business			0
according to @entity109 , @entity3 made $ 2 billion off the back of the 2014 tournament in @entity112			2
not bad for a not - for - profit organization			0
who is @entity17 ? @entity17 was the man chosen by @entity3 to head up the investigation into alleged corruption during the @entity10 bidding process			1
he worked as the @entity102 attorney for the @entity119 between 2005 and 2008 on some of the highest profile cases in the city			0
when he took on the role of @entity3 's independent investigator in july 2012 he promised to get to the bottom of what had happened			2
over 19 months , he compiled a report examining each of the bidding teams and speaking to witnesses from across the world of football			0
his 430 - page report was delivered in september and given to @entity90 to read			0
why did he resign ? @entity17 quit on the eve of the meeting in @entity24 and did n't go quietly			2
in a statement issued just 24 hours after his appeal was rejected , @entity17 made public his frustration			2
" it now appears that , at least for the foreseeable future , the @entity138 will stand as the final word on the 2018 and @entity142 bidding process , " he said			0
" no independent governance committee , investigator , or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization			0
" @entity3 president @entity55 said he was surprised by @entity17 's resignation but that the " work of the @entity150 will nonetheless continue			1
" what is going on at @entity3 ? @entity3 has taken a battering in the press -- particularly the @entity78 press -- following its failure to deal with the furor surrounding the @entity17 report			1
football fans are growing tired of the body 's refusal to reform , while former players such as @entity163 's @entity162 have taken to @entity164 to vent their frustration			0
sponsors such as @entity168 and @entity169 have both issued statements criticizing @entity3 over its lack of transparency , while @entity173 will not be renewing its partnership with the organization when its endorsement deal ends in the near future			2
there is still widespread skepticism at the way @entity11 and @entity13 won the rights to host the next @entity10 even though both were cleared of any wrongdoing and deny any allegations of wrongdoing			1
meanwhile @entity55 , the president who is still going strong at the age of 78 , is expected to stand for a fifth term as head of @entity3			2
that plan has angered both @entity68 and the @entity191 , which have said is time for the @entity192 to stand down			0
@entity55 faces little competition to retain his presidency and is already assured of support from @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198			0
@entity199 , the only man to have openly declared his candidacy , is unlikely to trouble @entity55 at the polls			0
will the @entity10 still be held in @entity13 ? it looks likely at the moment , despite huge protests over the @entity206 's human rights record and the allegations of corruption which surrounded the bid , that @entity13 will keep the tournament			2
@entity55 certainly showed no sign of objecting , insisting that @entity3 will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote			2
according to a report by @entity219 and confirmed by the government , 964 workers from @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 died while living and working in the country in 2012 and 2013			0
the @entity222 has estimated that 4,000 workers could die while working on projects by the time the @entity142 begins			0
the @entity13 government says there are more than over 1.4 million foreign workers currently plying their trade in the country and conditions are improving			2
according to the @entity232 , the organization responsible for the @entity10 , huge progress has been made to improve the lives of migrant workers			0
it says that it " is committed to improving labor conditions for workers employed on 2022 @entity142 projects and the @entity240 works to achieve the highest possible standards for those employed on its projects -- this not only includes construction workers , but also workers of service suppliers			0
" what next ? all eyes will remain firmly on @entity55 as we enter 2015 and the @entity3 presidential contest which will be held in may			2
the report is unlikely to be published any time soon given the legal constraints			0
more is likely to be revealed in the coming weeks but there are other avenues which could bring more revelations			0
the @entity257 is currently running an inquiry into whether there was any wrongdoing , while the @entity261 in the @entity78 is doing similar work			0
for now thought , it 's a case of wait and see .			0
