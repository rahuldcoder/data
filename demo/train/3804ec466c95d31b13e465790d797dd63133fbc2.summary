@entity0 -- it was a heartwarming sight : @entity3 and @entity4 landing on @entity6 soil and being reunited with their families			0
to the elation of their families , @entity9 returned to the @entity6 with journalists @entity3 and @entity4			1
then , after an appropriate amount of time for hugs and kisses , @entity9 appeared , descending from his movie - producer friend 's plane like an angel from heaven			1
an emotional @entity3 practically referred to the former president as a messiah , describing to the media and well - wishers waiting at the airport how she and @entity27 thought they were being sent to a hard - labor camp , only to walk through a door to find @entity9			1
the crowd broke into loud applause			0
for all of those who wondered what @entity9 would do in @entity36 's diplomatic world , wonder no longer			1
as details of the @entity9 mission came out , it was revealed that the @entity40 themselves asked for @entity9 , promising amnesty for the women upon delivery of the former president , whose visit eluded them while he was in office			1
the deal was done even before @entity9 stepped on the plane			2
so what is next for @entity9 ? if the mere thought of a meeting with him is enough to move a regime notorious for never moving , can the @entity53 administration use that star power to rescue three @entity6 hikers who ventured into @entity60 and are believed to be held by @entity60 authorities ? can @entity9 head off two @entity63 attack submarines cruising in the @entity64 off the @entity65 of the @entity6 ? former presidents are used as envoys and undertake humanitarian missions all the time			2
then - president @entity9 used former president @entity69 to travel to @entity40 in 1994 to negotiate the end to the first nuclear crisis			1
@entity9 and his predecessor , @entity72 , were tapped by @entity72 's son , then - president @entity73 , to lead relief efforts to help @entity76 and @entity77 nations devastated by the 2004 tsunami and again in 2005 after @entity79			1
but the relationship between @entity9 and @entity36 and president @entity53 is complex , to say the least			2
after a bitter - fought battle during the @entity84 primaries , @entity36 supporters were looking for a robust role for her in exchange for her support of @entity53 , with many even suggesting her as a possible candidate for vice president			0
that idea was short - lived			0
the @entity53 team wanted @entity36 far from the @entity95			0
and they wanted @entity97 even farther			0
when @entity53 tapped @entity36 to be his secretary of state , there was no shortage of critics who asserted that her husband 's global foundation and role as a high - paid public speaker would present a conflict of interest			1
the @entity108 agreed to strict rules of the road to avoid such conflicts going forward			0
however @entity36 never demurred in her praise for what her husband has accomplished , both during his eight years in the @entity115 or post-presidency			0
@entity36 herself has said she considered her husband a trusted adviser and could even consider using him where appropriate			0
he is a former president , after all			0
@entity9 has largely stayed out of the limelight , quietly continuing his globetrotting on behalf of the world 's poor and downtrodden			2
in may , @entity123 secretary general ban ki - moon appointed him as the @entity123 ' special envoy to @entity125 in an effort to refocus international attention on the @entity130 country 's deep economic problems and environmental decay			2
but with the success of his @entity40 mission so quick and easy , it 's conceivable that @entity9 could add the role of " diplomatic cleaner " to his resume -- a version of @entity140 's role as @entity141 in the movie " @entity141 " -- a fixer of messy problems , which he solves with a combination of stylish charisma and lucid thinking under pressure			1
the @entity53 administration has no shortage of messy foreign policy problems that @entity36 knows could use a @entity141 .			1

spotlight returns to @entity9 after successful mission to @entity40
*ex-president* 's speedy *retrieval* of detained journalists could set stage for new role
in " @entity141 , " characters turned to @entity141 to calmly solve messy problems
*analysis* : @entity9 's charms could be used with @entity167 - like *efficiency* around globe
