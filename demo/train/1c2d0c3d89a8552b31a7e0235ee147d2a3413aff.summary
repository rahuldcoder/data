-- a few weeks ago , @entity1 brought home her middle - school report card			1
she got an a in band , and her parents could n't be prouder			2
any parent would be pleased by an @entity7 but for 13 - year - old @entity1 , who goes by @entity8 , that a in band is a symbol			1
it represents eight months of hard work , a collection of new skills , and , most importantly , a complete turnaround in @entity8 's social and academic life			1
@entity8 has high - functioning autism			1
that means she walks and talks a little differently than other kids , her parents say , and she 's " painfully aware " of these differences			2
some students at her @entity25 , @entity27 , middle school treat her " as someone who is not very cool , " said her father , @entity31			1
@entity8 has few friends and frequently eats lunch by herself			2
she sometimes comes home crying because of teasing			0
she also experiences sudden outbursts of anger and frustration			0
luckily , @entity8 has the dream team of parents on her side			1
@entity31 is a clarinetist and music professor at @entity45 and @entity46			1
her mother , @entity47 , is a counselor working toward her ph.d. in counseling and supervision at @entity52			0
last summer they were trying to come up with a strategy to help @entity8 deal with some of the bullying problems at school and decided to attempt an experiment : @entity31 would start giving her clarinet lessons			1
why did they think music would help ? there were a variety of reasons , from emotional to scientific			0
her father thought it would help @entity8 " channel her frustration through music			1
" her mother was interested in the neuroscience behind how the brain deals with music			0
" we can not prove anything , but there are many studies that say how the brain can change when you do music - making ... the part of the brain that was n't working very well has to find another way to work			0
" this is your brain on music plus , they both desperately wanted to give @entity8 a social outlet and help her become part of a group			1
@entity31 had taught clarinet to other kids @entity8 's age but never someone with autism			1
he immediately learned he would have to adjust his teaching style			0
the first lesson , they spent 30 minutes just putting the instrument together			0
" with autism , you really need to do one thing at a time , " he said			0
" in music , you usually give about four or five commands per sentence , but for children with autism , you just ca n't do that			1
they kind of freeze ; they do n't know what to do first			0
so i had to kind of slow down			0
" he learned to speak @entity112 's language , too			0
when she described the different kinds of notes on a page of sheet music as looking like different types of chocolate -- dark or white -- he went with it			0
" there are so many things just to get a note , all this coordination , which is very important in @entity8 's case , " he said , explaining that it 's sometimes difficult for children with autism to perform several tasks at the same time			1
but once she got it , @entity8 took to the clarinet " like a duck to water			2
" her parents noticed changes in her almost right away			0
it 's been less than a year since she started playing and already , they say , her speech has improved and she 's more focused in school , which has led to better grades			1
although neither of @entity8 's parents is technically a music therapist , data published in the @entity143 backs up their observations			1
a 2005 study showed that people with autism who participated in music therapy for a year improved by at least 25 % in one of five areas of focus , including behavior / psychosocial and language / communication			2
according to the @entity175 , which publishes the journal , " research supports connections between speech and singing , rhythm and motor behavior , memory for song and memory for academic material , and overall ability of preferred music to enhance mood , attention and behavior to optimize the student 's ability to learn and interact			2
" everything i need to know , i learned in music class but by far the biggest change the @entity181 have seen has been the improvement in @entity8 's social life			1
" playing music can soothe the pain of isolation and provide a safe space where she is accepted , " said @entity31			1
before , @entity8 was n't part of a group			2
now she has the band			0
her parents can tell from the way she brags about being a member that it 's made a world of difference			2
@entity8 's mother cried as she described how being part of the band has affected @entity8 -- and the whole family			1
" i wanted her to have an experience where she would feel good about herself -- that the bullying would be so small in the world that she would not fill herself with anger , " she said			0
" and this was a big change			0
i think the way she 's dealing with bullying now is much different			2
she 's not coming home crying as before			0
it 's such a relief			0
" @entity31 keeps a journal about the results of teaching @entity8 clarinet , and he 's posted suggested lesson plans for children with autism on his website			1
the @entity222 , who have spoken and written about their experience ( including on @entity225 ) so that others can benefit , say they 've received dozens of e-mails from parents of children with autism			1
they 're planning to write a book or manual about their method , and they presented a paper , titled " @entity236 : emotional regulation through @entity238 , " at last year 's @entity240 convention			0
as for @entity8 , she just loves to play in the band			2
when asked about the experience of taking clarinet lessons from her dad , she replied , simply , " he 's the best			0

@entity31 and @entity248 taught their *daughter* clarinet to help her cope with bullying
@entity8 , who has autism , started playing in her middle school band last fall
her parents say it 's given her a social outlet and a way to express her feelings
they hope to publish a book so other children with autism can benefit from music
