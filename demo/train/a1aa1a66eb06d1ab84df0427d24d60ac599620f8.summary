@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 troops will pull out of the notorious @entity7 district of @entity10 's @entity9 province to allow @entity12 @entity11 to take over , @entity4 defense secretary @entity3 said wednesday			1
the @entity4 forces will redeploy to the central part of @entity9 , leading the task force with @entity17 and @entity18 troops there , while @entity12 troops are positioned in the northern and southern parts , @entity3 said			1
" this will simplify current command arrangements , " @entity3 told the @entity21			0
" the result will be a coherent and equitable division of the main populated areas of @entity9 between three brigade - size forces			2
" @entity29 's @entity28 ( @entity28 ) closely consulted @entity4 about the plan , and @entity4 officials " fully support " it , @entity3 said			2
" in @entity7 , @entity4 forces have made huge progress in the face of great adversity , " he said			1
" the district center has been transformed			0
@entity9 as a whole is a safer place as a result of our endeavors and sacrifices there			2
" the switch of command in @entity7 is in no way a defeat for @entity4 troops , but simply works well militarily , said @entity48 , director of the @entity49 , an independent defense and security think tank in @entity0			1
" it never made much military sense to put troops into the northern areas of @entity7 , @entity56 and @entity57 in the first place , " @entity48 said , " but in 2006 they were sent there at the insistence of ( @entity10 ) president ( @entity63 ) @entity62 , and once established , any pullback would have represented a victory for the @entity66			1
" with the arrival of 18,000 @entity12 @entity11 in the region by the end of august , it makes sense for the @entity4 troops to reorganize themselves and reinforce their numbers in central @entity9 , @entity48 said			1
it will make the @entity4 force more effective and safer , he said			2
the political fallout of the move , however , is unpredictable , @entity48 said			0
when the @entity4 ended operations in the southern @entity80 city of @entity81 last year , it was under similar circumstances , but still appeared as a " furtive retreat , " he said			0
" the image at home that @entity4 was giving up a job it could no longer handle was impossible to shake off , " @entity48 said			0
" the same may attach to @entity7			0
this war is as much about image and perception as it is about who controls the ground in @entity10			0
