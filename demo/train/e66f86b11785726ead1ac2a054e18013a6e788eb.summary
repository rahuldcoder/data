@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 believes his father 's killer is one of the hundreds of stable workers who live and care for horses in an area known as the " backside " of the @entity11 horse racing grounds			1
" i imagine he 's wandering around here , " @entity3 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview first aired on " @entity13 " , near the barn where his father 's body was found			1
" it has to be someone who lives here because no one else can come in			0
" @entity24 investigators have released few details about the death of 48 - year - old @entity27			0
police say @entity3 's body was discovered around 5 a.m. sunday morning by barn workers , just several hours after the final races of @entity32			1
the body was left in barn no. 8 , which backs up to the backstretch of the famed @entity11 horse racing track			1
the " backside " of @entity11 is made up of dozens of barns that house more than a thousand horses			1
it 's also where some 600 stable hands live			1
it 's a secluded and often overlooked world			1
it 's home to the transient workers of the horse racing industry			1
most workers are @entity48 immigrants who move around the country looking for work with stables and trainers			2
" the outside world does n't see this world			2
they do n't know what the backside of the racetrack is like , " @entity11 chaplain @entity55 said			1
" it does concern us that there 's someone back here or there could be someone back here still that could commit such an act			2
" police say there are no suspects in the slaying of @entity27 but are looking into several altercations that occurred at the track			1
@entity3 said he last heard from his father around 11:30 p.m. saturday night			2
both men talked on the phone for several minutes at the end of a hard day 's work during the @entity32			0
" he called me to see how i was doing and where i was , " @entity3 said			0
this was almost a daily routine for both men			0
father and son worked in different barns on the @entity11 grounds and could go most of the day without seeing each other			1
" he told me he was outside ( the racing grounds ) at a restaurant with friends , " @entity3 added			0
" everything was normal , like every time he called me			0
he never told me there were any problems			0
" @entity3 said he has n't heard any stories of his father getting into any altercations the night of the murder			2
he also said he never heard his father talk of having enemies or having any problems with anyone around the grounds			2
@entity3 first walked through the gates of @entity11 two years ago			2
he had convinced his father to let him leave home in @entity108 and find work in the barns caring for horses			0
@entity27 worked for horse trainer @entity112 , the brother of three - time @entity32 - winning jockey @entity113			0
@entity3 said he wanted to leave @entity108 to get closer to his father , who had been working in @entity1 since 2008			0
" i asked him to bring me here , " said @entity3			0
" i wanted to be with him			0
" the backside of horse racing tracks is the forgotten side of the horse racing grounds			1
it 's an area that highlights the stark class structure of horse racing			1
it 's where you see millionaire horse owners standing shoulder to shoulder with stable hands who roughly earn between $ 250 and $ 800 a week for a variety of jobs caring for the prized horses			1
" such a mash of people back here , the richest of the rich , the poorest of the poor and everyone in between , " said @entity55 , who ministers to the stable hands			0
but it 's also a secluded and difficult world for outsiders to penetrate			1
workers often move around the country , from horse track to horse track following the work wherever it goes			1
@entity55 said on any given day there are about 600 people who live on the backside of @entity11			1
they can live on the grounds for free , but the workday usually starts early			0
around 4 a.m. workers start cleaning the stables and feeding horses			0
other workers prepare the horses for their daily workouts on the racetrack			0
@entity55 hoped stable workers who might have information about @entity27 's slaying wo n't be reluctant to come forward			1
" i 'm hoping someone will say something , if not to me , to a trainer or to a friend that they become comfortable with , " he said			0
@entity3 said he still loves the work at @entity11			2
in fact , since his father 's death he 's kept working through the pain and anguish even as he makes arrangements to get his father 's body sent home to @entity108 for a burial			1
@entity3 said he does n't want to return to @entity108 ; he wants to keep working at @entity11			2
" he was a good father , " @entity3 said			0
" everything he knew ; he would pass on to me			0

*victim* 's son thinks his father 's killer is one of @entity11 ' stable workers
" backside " of horse racing track is a secluded , overlooked world
no suspects in slaying , but police looking into altercations at track
son said father never said anything about enemies or troubles
