thought of as my alter ego			0
but " @entity3 " misrepresents the advertising industry of my time by ignoring the dynamics of the @entity12 that changed the world of communications forever			1
from where i sit , claiming this exasperating show is even remotely representative of the times we lived through would be like trying to show " dynasty " on the @entity19 ! " @entity3 " is nothing more than the fulfillment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters -- with one - night - stands and excessive consumption of @entity30 and @entity31 -- is glamorous and " vintage			1
" it was not like that			0
that dynamic period of counterculture in the 1960s found expression on @entity39 through a new creative generation -- a rebellious coterie of art directors and copywriters who understood that visual and verbal expression were indivisible , who bridled under the old rules that consigned them to secondary roles in the ad - making process dominated by noncreative hacks and technocrats			1
in the very first week of the 1960s , after a successful year as an award - winning art director at the legendary @entity55 , i left			0
and with two copywriters as partners , started what was unthinkable at the time , the first ad agency to have the name of an art director in its masthead , and later , the first to go public			0
it was a testy time to be a graphic designer like me who had the rage to communicate and , to create icon rather than con			0
and , unlike the tv " @entity3 , " we worked full , exhausting , joyous days : pitching new business , creating ideas , " comping " them up , storyboarding them , selling them , photographing them , and directing commercials			2
and our only " extracurricular activity " was chasing fly balls and dunking basketballs on our agency softball and basketball teams ! the instant success of our trailblazing firm inspired a handful of other creative groups to form agencies and join our passionate revolution as we created advertising and imagery that caught people 's eyes , penetrated their minds , warmed their hearts , and caused them to act -- raising the bar of mass communication throughout the world			0
of course the producers of " @entity3 " are making tv drama and not documentary			1
for the record , please know that i , and the other real @entity3 , bear no resemblance to their lineup of talentless hacks who carouse the halls of the fictitious @entity3 ad agency			1
and even if i wanted to have an adulterous affair ( which i definitely did not , @entity111 ) who had the time ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity116 .			2

@entity116 , *renowned* adman , says " @entity3 " is nothing like ad world of ' 60s
he says the show is riddled with *incorrect* stereotypes : *rampant* *drinking* , adultery , carousing
he says real " @entity3 " *hardworking* rule - *breakers* , expressing *roiling* counterculture
@entity129 : yes , show is drama , not documentary , but for the record , real @entity3 were nothing like it
