, fans of the franchise get nervous			2
and creator @entity15 is bringing quite a change to " @entity14			1
" ( the name is an anagram of " @entity10			1
" ) " @entity14 " fans have been jonesing for more of series star @entity21 's antics as capt. @entity22 for the past two years			1
during the prolonged hiatus , @entity15 aligned the franchise with subscription cable channel @entity25 and moved the entire setting of the show from the @entity7 to the @entity29 fans are curious about what 's happened to their favorite characters in the meantime and what a bigger budget could mean for the show			1
" @entity14 " started in 2006 as a @entity39 prime - time sci - fi show about a character and investigative team that originated on the popular " @entity10 " reboot			1
@entity21 's character is a mysterious , immortal man from the 51st century who adopted the identity of a @entity49 @entity48 pilot and ultimately ended up protecting mankind with the help of a secretive alien - hunting team of @entity53			2
this season of " @entity14 , " titled " @entity55 , " airs at 10 p.m. et friday night on @entity25			1
the season begins with a supernatural occurrence that halts human death on the entire planet			2
actress @entity60 returns as @entity61 , and @entity29 actors @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 join the cast			0
the last season of the series , titled " @entity14 : children of @entity76 , " was broadcast in 2009 , and the storyline followed the decimation of capt. @entity22 's @entity14 team , including the painful loss of his romantic partner , @entity74			1
at the end of " @entity14 : children of @entity76 , " the surviving team was officially disbanded			2
" the last time we saw @entity22 , he was drowning his sorrows in the ' @entity10 ' version of the ' @entity89 ' cantina , " said @entity82 , a 29 - year - old @entity3 fan and @entity84 project manager in @entity86			1
so what brought capt. @entity22 back to @entity76 for " @entity55 " ? @entity21 is n't spoiling the surprise -- which he says changes everything -- but wants fans to rest assured that the quirky , silly heart of " @entity14 " is back			1
" whatever issues he had , he 's gone off and dealt with , and now he 's come back refreshed and raring and ready to go , " @entity21 said			0
and so is his libido			0
@entity21 is keen to point out that fans will see capt. @entity22 have " full - on man sex in this series , " which should n't shock sci - fi fans in the least			1
" that 's what makes science - fiction fans so brilliant , " @entity21 said			2
" they are accepting about different people and the differences between each other			0
i am a fan myself			2
we 're all a little nerdy			0
we 're all a little different - looking than everybody else			0
we might have some little foible ; we might have some little obsession , but you know what , as fans of science - fiction , we all understand that about each other			2
" @entity21 said his point of view on the acceptance of sexualities in television , as a gay man , is the same as that of sci - fi fans			1
" if you do n't like me for who i am , do i really need to know you ? i think that 's the attitude that sci - fi fans have , too			1
we 're not going to let people dictate that we should be something other than who we are , " he said			0
relationships have been a hallmark of @entity15 ' work on " @entity14 " and " @entity10			1
" " i know @entity15 has taken a lot of flak for all the relationships on @entity10 , " @entity142 said , explaining that before @entity15 rebooted the franchise , the character of the doctor had been largely asexual since the 1960s			1
" @entity22 has relationships with everybody , because that 's the kind of person he is , " she said			0
capt. @entity22 famously had a tryst with " @entity156 " fan - favorite @entity154 in the 2008 " @entity14 " episode " @entity158 , @entity159			1
" @entity154 played capt. @entity160 , @entity161 ' former partner and a time - traveling bad boy			0
" it was a great moment			0
i loved it , " @entity21 said			0
" walking through the saloon doors , right up to each other , looking like we 're just going to punch the crap out of each other , and then they kiss ! brilliant ! " the character of @entity22 is not necessarily gay or bisexual			0
" despite the fact that @entity22 is ' try - sexual ' -- he 'll try anything -- his relationship with @entity74 reached a peak in ' @entity181 , ' " said @entity171 , @entity7 sci - fi fan and senior director of guest hospitality for @entity175 , a fan convention in @entity86			1
" when @entity74 's sister asked him , ' well , you 're dating this guy ; does that mean you 're gay ? ' and @entity74 looked at her and said , ' i do n't know , but i know i love @entity22			0
' " that focus on how many people in this world can love one specific person is very nerdy , @entity171 said			0
" sci - fi fans have realized that a relationship is a relationship			1
however that relationship happens for you is what 's important			0
" we all have our own beliefs , and fandom believes that one day the world will move in the direction where everyone says , ' your belief is your belief , and your way of living is your way of living			0
as long as you 're not hurting me , i do n't care what you do			0
' " and although sci - fi fans deeply identify with the characters on the show , it 's the writing on " @entity14 " that keeps fans dedicated , @entity171 said			1
" especially to ( fans of writer @entity212 ) , because that was @entity212 ' bread and butter			0
he can write conversations probably better than anyone in the business today			0
@entity15 being a very close second			2
" " i think now that ' @entity14 ' has really hit its stride , @entity15 is doing a better job than he did on ' @entity10 , ' " @entity142 said			1
@entity21 says the secret to the show 's success is that the entire creative team is made up of science - fiction fans			2
" this is a show with people who are fans of the genre , " he said , " with writers who are fans of the characters , with actors who are fans of the history of the show and of science - fiction			2
it 's made by fans , which is incredible			0

" @entity14 " teams up with @entity25 for the *fourth* season , titled " @entity55 "
homosexual , bisexual , even " try - sexual " relationships do not faze sci - fi fans
@entity15 ' writing better on " @entity14 " than " @entity10 , " said fan
