editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity20 's southern border with @entity21 ( @entity9 ) -- deposited along @entity20 's southern border with @entity21 are vast numbers of @entity24 - made cluster bombs buried beneath the grasses of the region 's valleys			1
originally used by the @entity21 military to combat @entity32 forces firing rockets across the border , the bombs impacted in the soil were being ferreted out by a small @entity36 team from the @entity38 battalion			1
@entity39 , @entity9 's creative director , and a small film crew donned camouflaged @entity42 -- protective personal equipment -- and tagged along on one of their minesweeping missions in october 2007			1
we were brought first to an abandoned soccer field			0
yellow rope was strung around the field and the surrounding forest , indicating areas that had already been cleared			0
one soldier stood over a patch of grass and a small pile of scrap metal			1
" this morning , we started here at 6:00			0
two hours later , " he said , pointing to a the yellow rope four feet farther into the forest , " we are here			0
" the team estimates that it has scanned about 18 percent of the area that the @entity21 army blanketed in cluster bombs during the conflicts with @entity32			1
every time a single bomb is launched , it releases dozens of submunitions that fall across the landscape , many of which fail to detonate and now cover about 12,500 square meters of the region			0
by the time we met up with the team , it had retrieved 53 submunitions			1
they believe that approximately 1 million of the parent bombs are hidden in @entity20 's southern valleys alone			1
procedurally , the task is daunting : inch by inch , they push forward , chopping the long grasses with garden shears to increase ground visibility and then running over the area slowly with minesweepers			2
the minesweepers are handheld devices that look like typical metal detectors , emitting a variety of high - pitched whines that vary depending on the density of the ground			0
this day , the team pushed on together slowly , sensitive to each of the various frequencies and graciously telling us as soon as they found something			2
by the end of the afternoon , they had unearthed a single submunition -- not a bad haul by any stretch			0
it was a 155 - millimeter explosive about the size of a fist			0
this represents just one of 88 submunitions that are held inside each @entity24 - made cluster bomb			2
the team detonated the explosive , surrounding it with sandbags and standing a safe distance away			2
after the explosion , @entity39 surveyed a large hunk of detonated submunition : " two lives saved ? " the @entity38 @entity36 team leader nodded			1
" yes , two lives			0
