student protesters pack the streets			2
opposition leaders and government officials blame each other for the unrest , and both sides show no sign of backing down			2
no matter who you believe , it 's clear that tensions are running high in @entity14			1
the anti-government demonstrations are the biggest threat president @entity17 has faced since his election last year			1
and inside and outside the @entity22 country 's borders , there 's a major question many are asking : could this @entity24 for @entity14 's socialist government ? searching for truth in @entity14 the situation does n't look pretty			1
inflation topped 56 % last year			2
goods shortages have left store shelves bare			2
but the next election is years away , and experts say it 's likely too soon to start ringing the death knell for @entity37 's revolution just yet			1
a variety of scenarios could play out in the coming days , depending on the steps authorities and protesters take			2
and , with so many factors in flux , it 's difficult to guess what 's next			1
" anything can happen now , " said @entity46 , a professor of political science at @entity48			2
" this is a real crisis on all fronts			2
the government has ways to survive ... but at the same time , it can lose this battle			0
" here are some possible game - changers to keep an eye on : government crackdowns on protesters @entity59 , the opposition politician accused by the government of inciting violence and leading the recent protests , is behind bars , facing charges of arson and conspiracy			1
@entity17 has vowed to crack down on other opposition leaders like him , calling them fascists and comparing them to a disease that must be cured			0
he 's defended that approach in national television broadcasts , accusing protesters of violence , vandalism and plotting a slow - motion coup			1
" is capturing these people repression ? or is it justice ? " @entity17 said after airing videos during a national broadcast that he said showed opposition attacks on government buildings			0
any ratcheting up of repression could have a major cost for the government , possibly turning supporters at home and abroad against it , said @entity89 , a senior fellow at the @entity90			0
" in contrast to @entity14 's serious problem with street crime , for which the government does not traditionally pay a political price , for this kind of repression it will , " @entity89 wrote in an analysis of the situation this week			1
" at best , it reveals a government that can not control its guns			0
at worst , it reveals a government that is as violent as its opponents have long claimed			0
" on the other hand , the government could defuse the situation			0
" if the government responds in some way and deals with the situation by relieving some of the distress and trying not to clamp down further , and showing some flexibility and some willingness to engage in some dialogue and moderation , then i think it could weather this period , " said @entity111 , president of the @entity112 think tank			0
support from @entity123 there 's one major reason analysts point to when they say that @entity14 's socialist government is n't approaching any sort of imminent collapse : many people in the country are still behind the president			1
" @entity17 has a lot of support , " said @entity133 , an assistant professor of political science at @entity135			0
" he 's not @entity37 , but he 's seen as a relatively faithful representative of what @entity37 stood for			1
" the cornerstone of @entity37 's presidency was the @entity142 , his ambitious plan to turn @entity14 into a socialist state			1
social " missions " aimed at eradicating illiteracy , distributing staple foods and providing health care popped up across the country			0
@entity37 was elected and re-elected in large part thanks to support from the country 's poor , who felt marginalized by previous governments			1
he tapped into their needs and frustrations -- often through confrontations with the @entity159 elite			0
@entity17 -- who @entity37 tapped as his successor before he died -- has taken a similar tack			1
his narrow election victory last year was closer than supporters had hoped , but he still won			0
throngs of @entity17 's dedicated followers still call themselves @entity166 in devotion to the former president			1
even though @entity17 is nowhere near as charismatic as @entity37 , for many , he 's still better than the alternative , @entity111 said			1
" they perceive that there are parts of the opposition that want to go back to @entity14 , which basically ignored the concerns of the poor , " @entity111 said			1
" they do n't want to lose what they think they 've gained			0
" a key challenge for the opposition is chipping away at @entity123 ' support for the government			0
if they can win over @entity37 loyalists , that could tip the scales			1
@entity188 - @entity133 , who authored " we created @entity37 : a @entity191 of the @entity142 , " argues that 's not likely			1
the revolution , he says , is much bigger than @entity37 or @entity17			1
" the @entity195 government has been in power for more than 14 years and has won a larger number of elections than any other government essentially on earth because they mobilized the poor and have a strong support base among the poor , and also a chunk of the middle class , " @entity133 said			0
" this support base is not going anywhere , and it 's not going to disintegrate because a relatively small number of students are protesting in relatively middle class areas of the country			1
" follow the money for months , major goods shortages have left shelves bare in @entity159 stores			0
the government accuses distributors of orchestrating the shortages as part of an " economic war " to fuel unrest			0
the opposition says that 's one of many painful examples that show the government 's mishandling of the country 's finances			2
while the populist platform of sharing @entity14 's vast oil wealth with the poor and disenfranchised has helped reduce poverty , critics have warned that flawed economic policies -- such as currency controls and expropriation of private companies -- set the country on a crash course toward financial ruin			1
despite government efforts to stem inflation with price controls , analysts have said the economic picture looks bleak			0
it 's no coincidence that tensions are running high while @entity14 faces significant economic problems , experts say			1
" this has been sort of a cyclical phenomenon of protests in @entity14 , " @entity111 said			1
" but i think we 're at a different point in the evolution of a situation , a point where the economic situation is what 's driving what 's happening ... more than anything else , just the shear economic desperation for many people and the shortages and the rising inflation			2
" and if those problems worsen , it 's not good for the government			2
" if @entity14 experiences a serious economic meltdown , the opposition movement could grow , despite not making any efforts to reach beyond its traditional base , " @entity89 said			1
military might right now , analysts say the military seems to be squarely behind @entity17			0
that was n't the case in 2002 , when @entity37 was briefly ousted from power by a military coup			1
" the military is much more chavista than it was in 2002 , " @entity133 said			0
but there could come a moment , @entity46 said , when the military 's loyalties are challenged			2
" if they are asked to be repressive , " he said , " they will face a difficult choice of whether to comply or not			2
" who 's protesting ? the recent protests have highlighted growing discontent with @entity14 's government , but also rifts within the opposition -- a disparate group of parties that banded together in an attempt to defeat @entity37 at the polls and now hope @entity17 's government will fall			1
@entity299 , a leading opposition politician who lost his bid for the presidency last year , has been trying to take a more moderate approach and build a broader support base			0
but @entity59 and other opposition leaders have pushed for protests in the streets			2
a looming question is whether the opposition @entity309 -- which includes parties with a wide range of ideologies within its ranks -- can stick together for a common political goal			0
" behind the scenes , the opposition is very much cracking , " @entity133 said			0
if more militant members of the opposition attempt a coup , he said , that will only backfire the next time @entity159 head to the polls			0
@entity89 said he 's seen how much @entity59 's impassioned speeches have fired up crowds			2
" this movement is energizing the opposition base in a way they have n't been in eight years , " @entity89 said			0
" but there seems to be little effort to reach out to disgruntled @entity166 , or broaden the message towards issues of equality and poverty reduction that might mobilize a broader coalition			0
" the toughest challenge the opposition faces might be keeping up the momentum they 've started			0
" it 's very hard to sustain protests			1
there have been other moments when there have been protests in @entity14 , and they come and they go , " @entity111 said			1
" if this one goes and sort of dies down , then i think @entity59 , his star may fade , and this whole episode may pass			0

experts say it 's too soon to ring the death knell for @entity37 's revolution
with so many factors in flux , it 's difficult to guess what 's next in @entity14
but there are some possible game - changers to keep an eye on
tensions are running high amid anti-government protests
