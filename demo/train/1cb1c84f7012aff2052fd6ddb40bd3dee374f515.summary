-- an attorney for a man charged in the abduction of @entity5 student @entity4 and assault of a different woman indicated friday that he wants his client to undergo a sanity evaluation			1
that development came as @entity11 was arraigned friday in the latter case in which he 's accused of sexually assaulting a woman in @entity14 , @entity15 , in 2005			1
@entity11 separately is charged with abducting @entity16 , the 18 - year - old sophomore whose body was found on an abandoned @entity15 farm october 18 , more than a month after she was last seen in @entity20			2
in friday 's arraignment in the @entity24 case , defense attorney @entity21 tried to introduce a motion seeking an evaluation for his client			2
a judge cut @entity28 short , saying that motion could be filed and considered later once a jurist was permanently assigned to the case			2
@entity24 prosecutor @entity32 told reporters friday that @entity21 ' motion sought a sanity evaluation that would help determine @entity11 's competency to stand trial			1
@entity11 made a virtual appearance at the @entity24 hearing via video from jail in @entity20 , where he 's being held in connection with the @entity16 case			1
in friday 's hearing , he was arraigned on three charges in the 2005 case : abduction , sexual assault and attempted capital murder			1
analysts say he may be tried first in @entity14 , because authorities there have had more time to build their case , and they have both dna evidence as well as a potential eyewitness			1
woman was dragged , sexually assaulted in the @entity24 case , authorities say that on september 24 , 2005 , a young woman returning from a grocery store was grabbed from behind by an assailant and sexually assaulted			1
" we saw her purse on the front sidewalk , " said neighbor @entity61			0
" he had already dragged her behind our units to the dark pool area			0
" @entity61 did not see the suspect 's face , but she immediately called police			0
" the offender was scared away by a passer - by , " the @entity72 said in a statement , " but the victim got a good look at him			0
" the victim helped authorities draw up a composite sketch , and now she could potentially be called as a witness at trial			0
" i 'd rather not say where she is , but she is cooperative , " @entity32 , the prosecutor , said last week			0
evidence may be challenged in addition to the victim 's potential testimony , the @entity72 also said it has dna evidence in the case			1
but dna evidence can be challenged in court , said @entity93 legal analyst and defense attorney @entity91 , as can the testimony of the victim			1
" when someone is undergoing a trauma , as in this case the victim was , you have to wonder whether that traumatic experience could make what she saw reliable , " @entity91 said			0
" on the other hand , the prosecution will argue that it 's emblazoned in her memory			0
" still , testimony and forensics may not be the only evidence in the @entity24 case			2
now that investigators have the name of a possible suspect , @entity91 said , they are likely chasing dozens of new threads , searching for evidence			0
for example , they would be looking for cell phone records , texts , surveillance video or toll booth receipts that might link @entity11 to the crime scene , or any friends or relatives or business associates that might place him in @entity24			2
@entity11 's attorney to represent him in both cases @entity21 , @entity11 's attorney in @entity20 , declined to comment on the charges or the evidence against his client in either city			1
the @entity24 judge granted @entity11 's request to have @entity21 represent him in the 2005 case , though the judge also appointed a public defender			1
in @entity20 , prosecutors on october 24 said that they are still weighing which additional charges they will file in the @entity16 case			0
the case could be more difficult to make , according to defense attorney @entity143 , since there may be no witnesses who could testify			0
it is also unclear what forensic evidence may exist in the case , aside from a surveillance video from the night of @entity16 's disappearance -- on september 13 -- that shows @entity11 , 32 , apparently following her in @entity20 's @entity153 area			1
" in @entity20 , the case is much more complicated than @entity24 , because the @entity20 case relies almost wholly on circumstantial evidence , " @entity143 said			2
@entity11 was taken into custody september 24 while camping on a beach in @entity159 , @entity160 , some 1,300 miles from @entity20			2
he is the only person detained in connection with @entity16 's disappearance , and was charged with abduction with the intent to defile			0
@entity0 's @entity164 contributed to this report .			0

new : request for evaluation comes in separate sex assault case from 2005
@entity11 was last person seen with @entity5 student @entity4
authorities : dna evidence links him to 2005 sex assault
