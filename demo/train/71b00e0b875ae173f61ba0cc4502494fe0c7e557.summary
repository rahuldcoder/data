@entity0 -- the departure of @entity5 troops left many questions lingering in @entity7 sunday , analysts told @entity1 's " @entity8			1
" " there are a lot of things here that are not finished			2
there are activities in the region that are still sitting on the edge of potential conflict , " said retired gen. @entity14 , former vice-chairman of the @entity15			1
@entity21 , a former envoy to @entity7 under president @entity22 , said president @entity24 had " placed a very big bet " by pulling out troops			1
" the definition of victory actually was given by the president when he made the announcement we were pulling out			0
he said a democratic @entity7 can be a model for the region			1
that 's what president @entity22 also said			0
and the question is , can a democratic @entity7 survive if @entity5 pulls out before the job is done ? " he said			1
another key question , analysts said , is what neighboring @entity41 will do next			1
" @entity41 's clearly one of the strategic winners out of this			2
the @entity5 managed to eliminate one of the two arch - rivals that @entity41 faced , and so @entity41 has gained a much stronger position , " said @entity46 , a joint fellow at the @entity47 and the @entity48			1
" at the same time , " she added , " i think that once the @entity5 withdraws , that the historic tensions between @entity53 and @entity54 along the strategic border are likely to resurface , and that the @entity41 will have influence with many of the top leaders in ... @entity7 , but it does n't necessarily mean that the @entity7 are going to become the next @entity41 province			1
" the last @entity5 troops in @entity7 crossed the border into @entity64 sunday , marking the end of an almost - nine year war			2
according to the defense department , 4,487 service members were killed in the war ; more than 30,000 were wounded			0
it is impossible to know with certainty the number of @entity7 who have died in @entity7 since 2003			2
but the independent public database @entity75 has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and october 2010 , with four out of five dead being civilians			0
@entity24 said monday that the end of the @entity7 war means a new chapter in @entity5 - @entity7 relations , with a focus now on a " normal relationship between sovereign nations			2
" he told visiting @entity7 prime minister @entity85 that the two nations would build " a comprehensive partnership " that includes trade relations , support for building up @entity7 's democratic capacity and military - to - military ties aimed at helping @entity7 rebuild its air force , which was destroyed in the war against @entity95 's regime			2
" our goal is simply to make sure @entity7 succeeds , " he said			0
debate was raging about the nation 's political future sunday , as a political crisis erupted in @entity102 that raised fears of more sectarian strife to come			0
@entity105 , a powerful political bloc that draws support largely from @entity108 and more secular @entity7 , said it was boycotting parliament , a move that threatens to shatter @entity7 's fragile power - sharing government			0
the political bloc contends that @entity85 is trying to amass dictatorial power , and many believe that the prime minister was simply waiting for the @entity5 to leave before making his move			0
" these old sectarian divides are in many ways deeper than they were even under @entity95 , and the @entity5 can play a certain kind of role in that , " @entity46 said , pointing to the importance of diplomatic involvement even after @entity5 troops leave			1
@entity14 said @entity5 troops may return to @entity7 to help train @entity7 forces			1
" it will be interesting to see , " he said			0
" i think the opportunity is there for us to bring forces back in			0
" @entity1 's @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0

gen. @entity14 : " there are a lot of things here that are not finished "
@entity21 : " can a democratic @entity7 survive if @entity5 pulls out before the job is done ? "
what @entity41 will do next is a key question
@entity46 : " old sectarian divides are in many ways deeper than they were "
