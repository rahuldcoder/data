-- @entity1 has been one of @entity3 's biggest critics this season , but @entity6 's tire supplier has backed the seven - time world champion to end his long wait for a victory at sunday 's @entity10			1
the 43 - year - old , who has not finished on the podium since coming out of retirement in 2010 , told @entity0 that dealing with the rapidly degrading rubber this year was like " driving on raw eggs			1
" he has been outshone by @entity18 teammate @entity17 , but @entity3 's motorsport director @entity19 believes the @entity20 can perform well in @entity21 , where he has failed to make the top - 10 in two previous attempts			1
@entity1 did , however , top the qualifying times at another street circuit last month in @entity25 , but started the race sixth due to a penalty and ended up retiring early -- as he did last time out in @entity28			2
" i think you have to look at someone like , maybe @entity1 , getting the pole position , " @entity19 told @entity6 's official website			0
" he probably would have won @entity25 if he had n't been penalized , so why not here ? @entity34 , that 's where the money should go			0
" @entity39 chief : " @entity6 better than ever " @entity1 , who won 91 grands prix between 1992 and 2006 , was penalized in @entity41 due to a collision with @entity43 at the @entity44 @entity10			1
the former @entity46 driver has endured a miserable start to the 2012 season , collecting just two world championship points and retiring from five of the first seven races			2
@entity17 , meanwhile , is fifth on 67 points and clinched the first race win of his career in @entity54			1
but @entity1 , who has won the @entity10 a record six times at its former homes in @entity57 and @entity58 , is confident @entity18 can overcome the reliability issues which have dogged him			1
" our motto in the last few days has been to roll our sleeves up and focus on the job in hand , " he said			0
" everybody in the team has taken that approach to heart , so we can travel to @entity21 in an optimistic mood			0
" @entity18 team principal @entity70 , who worked with @entity1 at @entity46 , conceded he has not provided him with an adequate car			2
" the performance of our car and our tire management were generally good in @entity28 , however our competitiveness was compromised by reliability problems and mistakes , " said @entity70			0
" this is a disappointment that is deeply felt by everyone in our team , and we have been working hard to ensure we understand the reasons and deal with them			0
" achieving zero - defect reliability is our highest priority			0
the opportunities available if we can give both drivers a reliable car and a clean weekend are clear			0
" after this weekend 's race in @entity21 , the world championship will head to @entity91 for the @entity92 @entity10 on july 8 .			1

@entity1 tipped for *success* at sunday 's @entity95 @entity10
