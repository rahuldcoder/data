-- @entity1 was talking to his high school counselor one day when she delivered some bad news : he was white			2
at first , he tried to deny it			0
@entity1 had brown skin , and his parents spoke with a @entity8 accent			0
strangers called him " sheikh '' and " towel - head			2
" he was living in the @entity12 during the @entity14 hostage crisis in the early 1980s and would occasionally hear , " go home , @entity14			1
" but the evidence for his whiteness was plain to see			0
when @entity1 looked at college applications in his counselor 's office , he saw no racial category for @entity14			1
" that 's because you 're white , " his counselor explained as she instructed him to check the box marked " white			2
" " i told her , ' what do you mean , white ? i 've been going through all this crap , all this ribbing and teasing for years , and i 've been white all this time ? you should have told me earlier			2
' " @entity1 now has a message for other @entity31 - and @entity8 - @entity30 who have been living in racial limbo : " check it right ; you ai n't white ! " that 's the slogan of a campaign that may change how @entity31 - and @entity8 - @entity30 define themselves on the @entity30 census			1
activists are encouraging both groups to shun a practice that dates to the late 19th century , when immigrants from the @entity41 began identifying themselves as white			0
@entity1 and others say that @entity31 - and @entity8 - @entity30 should check the " other " box on the census form and write in their true ancestry			1
( @entity8 - @entity30 , such as those who trace their ancestry to @entity14 , are n't @entity31 , because they speak a different language and have a different culture )			1
their campaign echoes complaints voiced by @entity53 , african - americans and biracial people			1
they claim that the racial categories on the census form do n't accurately reflect how various groups define themselves			1
@entity59 , a campaign organizer , says it 's time for @entity31 - @entity30 to affirm their identities			1
" it 's important to show that we 're here , that we 're part of the @entity30 fabric , " said @entity59 , a city planner for @entity62 , @entity63			1
" we were invisible " it 's also practical , @entity31 - @entity30 leaders say			1
according to the @entity71 in @entity72 , there are an estimated 3.5 million @entity30 of @entity31 descent			1
but those numbers wo n't be reflected in this year 's census count because only race data , not ethnic data on groups like @entity31 , will be tabulated , institute leaders say			1
information from each census is used for everything from determining federal and state funding for communities to awarding grants , @entity71 leaders say			0
@entity87 , executive director of the @entity71 , says @entity30 have traditionally defined @entity31 in terms of their " otherness			1
" " for many years , we were invisible , or we were seen through an @entity91 lens : the @entity41 as barbaric or the enemy of the @entity93 , " @entity87 said			0
" we did n't have a strong identity			0
we fit into the normal @entity30 concept of race			2
" the lens may have changed , but the view is the same , others say			0
@entity31 - @entity30 are still seen as a problem people : potential terrorists or victims of racial profiling , says @entity59 , the @entity63 - based leader of the census campaign			1
" you look in the mainstream media , and they often try to minimize us as a group , like we 're a shadowy , fringe minority , " @entity59 said			0
if @entity31 - @entity30 are going to be treated as different , they might as well highlight their differences on census forms to get equal representation , @entity59 says			1
" we 're being profiled anyway , so why do n't we take pride in ourselves and gain advantage from it ? " he asked			0
how @entity31 - @entity30 became white centuries ago , there was little advantage to being called an @entity31 in @entity30 , one scholar says			1
the first wave of @entity31 - @entity30 immigrants arrived in the @entity30 around the end of the 19th century			1
most were @entity123 from present - day @entity124 and @entity125 , says @entity126 , co-author of " citizenship and crisis : @entity31 @entity129 after 9/11			1
" they came at a time when many @entity30 were turning against immigrants			2
the @entity30 erected exclusionary policies that would prevent many immigrants from non-western @entity136 countries from becoming citizens , @entity126 says			2
these immigrants often waged public campaigns , including court battles , to argue for the right to naturalize -- to become citizens			0
" each immigrant group had to fight their way into whiteness , " @entity126 said			0
@entity31 - @entity30 leaders clinched their claim to whiteness with a shrewd appeal to the dominant faith of their new homeland , she said			1
" they said , ' we 're @entity123 from the @entity152 , ' " she said			0
" ' if @entity153 is the symbol of @entity156 civilization , then we 're like the most original @entity123			0
we 're white people , too			0
' " ' i 'm not @entity14 ; i 'm @entity158 ' the practice of suppressing one 's @entity31 or @entity8 identity continued deep into the 20th century , says @entity1 , the @entity162			1
he grew up outside @entity12 in the 1980s , during the @entity14 hostage crisis			2
@entity14 - @entity30 were sometimes jeered for their heritage , he says			1
" a lot of @entity14 did n't want to deal with it , " he said			2
" they would say , ' i 'm @entity158 ' or ' i 'm @entity167			2
' there were a lot of guys who changed their name			0
i had a friend named @entity173 who changed his name to @entity175			0
" @entity1 says he once met a woman at a club who asked him about his heritage			0
" i told her i was @entity14 , and she walked away , " he said			2
@entity31 - and @entity8 - @entity30 were n't treated that much better on television , @entity1 says			1
" there was never a @entity41 performer who was a good guy , someone who i could get behind and say that this guy is inspiring me , " he says			0
@entity1 is now taking that role himself			0
today , he 's a popular comedian who helped lead the " @entity191 " comedy tour , which poked fun at @entity41 stereotypes			0
he recently filmed a television pilot called " funny in @entity194			0
" and he just filmed a playful public service announcement for an @entity14 - @entity30 group that 's encouraging @entity14 to affirm their heritage on the new census forms			1
@entity1 says he 's no longer checking boxes that say " white			2
" he 's proud of his heritage , and of being @entity30			1
" our community was kind of hiding			0
now , people are saying , ' let 's turn this around , ' " he said			0
there 's no need to hide			0

@entity31 - @entity30 no longer content to be labeled white
campaign aims to reflect proper numbers in census
some @entity14 - @entity30 used to pass as @entity158 to avoid conflict
now , many are proud of their heritage and of being @entity30
