@entity0 , @entity1 -- the chairman of the @entity4 got a firsthand look tuesday at the @entity7 nuclear plant on a visit organized by two members of @entity10 from @entity1 who want the plant shut down			1
chairman @entity12 toured the plant with longtime @entity7 opponents rep. @entity14 and rep. @entity16 , who have been raising concerns about the safety of the plant following the earthquake and tsunami in @entity22 that seriously damaged the @entity24 nuclear plant			1
" as i have repeatedly stressed to ( plant owner ) @entity27 and the @entity4 , i continue to have serious concerns about several specific issues related to @entity7 , " @entity14 said at a press conference following the tour			1
@entity7 is on the @entity31 , 35 miles north of @entity32			0
among the chief concerns raised by @entity14 and @entity16 is the feasibility of evacuating such a populated area in the event of an emergency			1
currently the @entity4 requires plants to have plans in place to evacuate a 10 - mile radius around their facilities			2
but , pointing out that the @entity4 urged @entity43 within a 50 - mile radius of the damaged @entity22 reactors to leave , @entity14 said that " evacuating 20 million people within a 50 - mile radius of @entity7 would be a near - impossibility			1
" " the bottom line , " said @entity16 after the tour , " i still believe @entity7 should be closed			2
" @entity12 said the visit was a good opportunity to hear firsthand from the representatives about their concerns			0
" i think it 's so important that we continue to have a very open and transparent dialogue , " he said			0
asked whether the proximity of the plant to such a densely populated area was sufficient reason to close the plant , as many @entity1 officials have argued , including gov. @entity64 , @entity12 said he could n't comment since @entity7 is undergoing a formal relicensing effort right now			1
there are two reactors at @entity7			0
one is due to be relicensed in 2013 and the other in 2015			0
@entity12 said the agency closely monitors the operation of all nuclear facilities " to ensure that they meet our very stringent safety and security requirements			0
" @entity7 , he said , meets those requirements			0
@entity14 and @entity16 have introduced a bill that would require the @entity4 to use the same standards it uses to license new nuclear plants when relicensing older plants , " including evaluating terror threats , seismic risk , population density and evacuation concerns , " @entity14 said			1
@entity16 , who first called for the plant to be closed following the 9/11 terrorist attacks , said , " if this plant were being built today , in 2011 , i can tell you it would not be sited here in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" @entity14 said new data showing that @entity7 is located at two fault lines means the @entity4 should also evaluate whether a seismic event could affect the power supply or cause the spent fuel pools to leak			2
@entity12 said as part of relicensing , the @entity4 looks at the seismic qualifications of plants to ensure that all systems will continue to operate safely			2
a task force of " top - notch experts " at the agency is looking at all the challenges and issues that emerged following the earthquake and tsunami in @entity22 , he said			0
" i expect that we 'll learn some good lessons , and i expect there will be some changes to our requirements as a result of that , " he said .			0

2 @entity1 members of @entity10 want nuclear plant closed
@entity14 , @entity16 say too many people live too close for evacuation
