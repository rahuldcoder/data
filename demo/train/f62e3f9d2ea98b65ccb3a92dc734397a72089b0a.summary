@entity0 -- the @entity3 's promo for @entity5 's new reality television venture features the gun - toting politico - turned - celebrity exploring her idea of @entity9 freedom : man caves , target shooting and race cars			1
" @entity14 's " teaser " she 's coming with a full heart and a full magazine , " might be getting snickers but some think she 's redefining political branding			1
that 's because , in this media obsessed culture , all of that on camera wilderness exploring , dog racing , and hunting , when coupled with fundraising and endorsing grassroots conservatives , adds up to a hefty boost in the @entity5 brand and political influence			1
" it keeps her visible , " said @entity34 , a @entity35 historian and @entity1 contributor			0
" the way she 's doing this , through reality television , might be the way politics is moving			1
some kind of combination of being active in political arena ... and acting in reality television might work			0
" in many ways it has for @entity5			1
she turned her failed 2008 vice presidential bid into a one - woman franchise that includes highly sought after speaking engagements , political endorsements , book deals and pundit gigs does @entity56 speak for you ? her political action committee , @entity58 , amassed just over $ 1 million through the end of last year , according to the @entity60			0
the @entity61 netted more than $ 5 million in 2012 and was able to use that money to donate to dozens of tea party backed candidates such as sen. @entity65 , @entity66 , sen. @entity67 , @entity68 and , fellow reality television star - turned - politico , rep. @entity70 , @entity71			1
given the demographics of the @entity3 , @entity5 's new show will likely trend @entity74 , said @entity75 , director of the @entity76 at the @entity77			1
such viewership wo n't do much to expand her brand beyond her base of supporters			2
" the people who would watch that would be disproportionately @entity86 members and white males to be blunt about it , " @entity75 said			0
however , @entity5 can and likely will leverage that solidified support among her base to get voters to support candidates and causes she backs , political experts say			1
" i 've been very impressed with the way she has used her notoriety and her appeal to get the average @entity9 in tune with our government , " said @entity94 , an editor and blogger with @entity96 who has spoken favorably of @entity5 in the past			1
" we 've seen her grow and find her appropriate voice in the political arena			0
i 'm not surprised she has her own tv show			2
the role she 's had in the grassroots level in getting them engaged in the political process is a good one			1
" and there is , some conservatives point out , precedence for blurring the lines between celebrity and a political career			2
" i think the answer lies in history			0
@entity123 twice elected actors to run the state			0
did ( @entity128 ) @entity127 's film career ( including @entity129 ) limit him ? or @entity133 's ( @entity134 ) movies hamper his political career , " said @entity130 , director of news operations at the conservative theblaze.com			2
but the high profile celebrity approach to politics may not bode well for her immediate prospects as an elected official			2
" she 's making money , " @entity75 said			2
" that 's all she has a motive to do right now			2
it ca n't be getting into politics			0
she has negatives through the roof			0
it would be like @entity155 getting back in			0
" @entity5 backs @entity156 after @entity56 appearance , endorses sessions ' challenger there is also risk in celebrity politics , political experts say			1
" it could go either way			0
there 's a way she can leverage it by remaining in the public eye and make it clear that she is a part of everyday @entity14 , " @entity34 said			0
" the big danger is that she makes herself look silly and not serious			0
" then again , @entity5 has had far more influence outside elected office than when she served as governor of @entity178			1
" i do n't know if it necessarily helps her expand the base as it solidifies the base , " said @entity179 , a conservative radio host and @entity1 political commentator who added that independent voters may turned off by @entity5 's popularity			1
" it may alienate others			0

@entity5 's new show " @entity191 " *broadens* the politico 's brand
@entity5 's appeal among grassroots conservatives remains high
she has leveraged that appeal to support candidates and causes she favors
her brand will likely not appeal to independents and she runs the risk of going too far
