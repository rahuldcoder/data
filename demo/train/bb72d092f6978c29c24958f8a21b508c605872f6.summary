-- the @entity5 is " shooting itself in the foot " by keeping @entity6 at bay , the country 's finance minister @entity1 says			1
the nation , with an economy sprinting ahead of @entity10 's continental countries , would be an asset for the region , he said			2
but @entity6 's path to @entity5 membership remains fraught , in part due to problems pitching the idea to the country and @entity10			1
the debt crisis which has ravaged the @entity10 continent has been unhelpful for @entity6 , but the key issue is feedback from @entity10 circles " that we 're not loved and we 're not wanted , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" it diminishes the support for change in this country because change requires leadership , but also requires a good story			0
" the @entity5 , @entity1 added , " is shooting itself in the foot by essentially trying to keep @entity6 at bay			1
i think that 's wrong but at the same time , my party just got 50 % of the vote and our platform strongly supports @entity5 membership -- so people still support change			2
" @entity10 recovery ? wait till 2013 ( at least ) there is a credible case for @entity5 accession , but that has been dented by the question marks raised over @entity6 's right to belong , @entity1 said			1
he argues @entity6 and @entity10 need each other			1
" i think for regional stability , for energy supply security , for better standards of democracy ... we need each other			0
" the country has its supporters			0
@entity58 prime minister @entity57 backs the country 's accession , and points to @entity6 's growing economy as a reason			1
but the @entity5 wants @entity6 to make further reforms , to the judicial system for example , before it can join			2
@entity6 -- which straddles @entity10 and @entity66 -- is in a key position to improve relations in the region			0
but the @entity70 , which drew in some of @entity6 's biggest trading partners , has been destabilizing for the area			2
" our neighborhood is quite noisy ... and right now is not stable , " @entity1 said			0
is the @entity70 failing its people ? but welcoming @entity6 into the @entity5 would , in the midst of such volatility , send a powerful message , he said			0
" you can be with the west			0
and you can be stable			0
