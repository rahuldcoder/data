-- when @entity2 was told to clean her room as a child , she imagined an army of robots doing the dirty work for her			1
" i looked around and i did n't see any robots helping me with the household chores , " the 24 - year - old engineering whiz said			1
" and i thought : ' i want to be part of making robots a reality			2
' " speaking to @entity2 , one of @entity17 's brightest young scientists , you get the feeling there 's not much she could n't solve with a bit of brain power			2
her latest project ? creating a bionic arm that could revolutionize the lives of quadriplegics around the world			1
young gun watching @entity2 speaking to a packed @entity30 crowd at one of her @entity33 talks , it 's hard not to get swept up in her effervescent and eloquent " can - do " view of the world			1
" why are we as a country doing such a bad job at inspiring the next generation of engineers ? " she asks , microphone headpiece strapped on , before clicking to her next slide show on a giant screen behind			0
has she always been this confident ? " i do n't know , i guess i get scared all the time really , " she says , speaking by phone above the din of @entity48 trams trundling past			0
@entity50 in 2012 , @entity2 was named " @entity51 , " a hugely prestigious award that saw her join the ranks of other remarkable youngsters @entity55 , the youngest person to single - handedly sail around the world , and swimmer @entity59 , the country 's most successful @entity60			1
@entity2 quickly learned to become comfortable on stage , in the following year giving 150 lectures on her work that combined science and , rather unusually , feminism			1
while an engineering student at @entity68 -- one of just five women in a class of over 50 men -- @entity2 founded @entity50 , a group of students encouraging girls to get involved in science and technology			1
just 11 % of engineers in @entity17 are women -- it 's a similar story the @entity80 ( 14 % ) and @entity81 ( 9 % ) -- and @entity2 felt compelled to show a new generation of girls that science could be fulfilling and even , wait for it , cool			1
" there 's this perception that engineering is for men , and girls do n't do that , " she said			2
" when i go to expos for @entity50 , i get young girls come up to me and say : ' oh my brother might be interested in this			2
' but i 'm like : ' no , this is something you can do , it 's really fun			0
' they do n't even realize it 's a possibility before you tell them that it is			0
" within four years , the organization had expanded to @entity81 , the @entity80 , and @entity103 , teaching over 8,000 girls robotics through school workshops , career talks , and community events			0
out on a limb when @entity2 recently graduated with a degree in @entity111 and @entity112 , she had the choice of hundreds of job offers			2
instead , she decided to strike out on her own , founding @entity115 -- a company " focused on building beautiful robots that help us in our everyday lives			0
" the team is now working on a bionic arm -- called " @entity122 " -- which would help quadriplegics			1
@entity126 on a wheelchair , the high - tech limb would be voice - operated and able to remember and repeat common tasks			1
" i was still finishing my studies off and i thought : ' what do i want to do ? what 's a cool , fun thing to do ? what will make me feel fulfilled ? what will give me purpose in my life ? ' " said @entity2			2
the lucky country growing up in a social housing estate in tropical north @entity139 , the determined young woman says her mom , a single - parent and hotel cleaner , was a huge influence in her life			0
" she always just did what she had to do , and that 's what i saw as a kid			0
" does she think @entity17 are too laid back when it comes to technology ? " i think we could have more of a vision for the future , " she says			0
" otherwise , if you 're just focused on the past , then there 'll be other countries that are more hungry , more innovative , and doing their best to work towards a better future			0
" " one day we 'll wake up and say : ' ok , what happened to all the great stuff that we enjoy ? ' "			0
