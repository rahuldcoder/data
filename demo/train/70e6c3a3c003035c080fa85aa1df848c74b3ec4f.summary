@entity1 mayor @entity0 on friday started the third day of his new administration with a predawn conference call to decide whether to close public schools after a major storm walloped the city with up to 6 inches of snow			1
" i had a great night ; it was not the most sleep - filled night , " @entity0 , an admitted night owl , told reporters friday morning during what 's seen as the first challenge for a new mayor pushing a progressive agenda that promises to serve all of the city 's 8 million residents			1
" i must say i have never done a 4 a.m. conference call in my life			2
" for the moment at least , @entity0 's vow to tackle a range of issues , from economic inequality to police and community relations , was superseded by a meteorological phenomenon that has famously haunted mayors in the past			1
" we are working in all five boroughs equally , " said @entity0 , surrounded by a small army of sanitation workers at a garage in @entity32			1
" i believe that that is not only a philosophical idea i believe in strongly ; it is also the fundamental belief of each member of this department to help each and every neighborhood equally			1
" @entity43 said sanitation crews were working 12 - hour shifts to clear the city 's 6,200 miles of roadways with 2,500 plows from various departments			1
he said 100 % of primary roads and 92 % of secondary roads had been plowed			2
about 93 % of tertiary roads were plowed with the help of private contractors			2
emergency response times were delayed about a minute because of snow and traffic , he said			2
in 2010 , mayor @entity58 was heavily criticized for his handling of a blizzard that shut down several subway lines for days			2
he was accused of allowing snow to pile up in @entity32 and letting large parts of @entity63 go unplowed for days			1
@entity58 defended city efforts to clear snow amid a swell of frustration by some snowbound residents , particularly outside of @entity68 , who wondered why their streets were still clogged days after the massive holiday storm			0
" i was here in 2010 and it was a disaster , " @entity73 , a teacher and @entity63 resident			0
@entity77 , sanitation commissioner since the administration of mayor @entity79 in the early 1980s , said @entity0 has handled the storm no differently from his previous bosses			1
" he wants the job done , and he wants the streets clear , " he said			0
" that 's what we do			0
" " it would have been nice to talk about how to handle a snowstorm in an abstract exercise , but we did n't get to do that , " @entity0 told @entity77			1
" we got the real thing			0
" @entity43 said the decision to close schools was made in the predawn hours because of the deceptively cold temperatures			0
" with this kind of bitter cold , " he said , " we did not want children out there , exposed			0
" friday morning , @entity0 emerged from his row house in @entity100 , @entity63 , with a shovel to clear his own sidewalk , something he said he has done for years			1
" i 'm a proud @entity63 , " he told reporters later			0
" i 'm an outer borough homeowner			0
" that populist approach was well received during his first real challenge as mayor			1
" we just consider him from our neighborhood and we expect he 's going to keep our interests at heart , " @entity63 resident @entity108 said			0
" i like his emphasis on middle - class people			2
" a virtual unknown nationally , despite 25 years in @entity1 politics , @entity0 defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from @entity63 and , most recently , as a public advocate -- a sort of civic watchdog -- sufficiently prepared him to run the @entity123			1
he also ran @entity126 's first @entity125 campaign			0
the new mayor admitted that his son , @entity128 , a high school student , lobbied heavily for closing the city 's schools			2
on social media , @entity128 said friends were asking him to pull strings to get the shutdown done			0
but @entity0 's wife , @entity135 , tweeted a photo of a shovel and snow salts thursday night to illustrate " what @entity128 will be doing if he does not go to school			1
" " if @entity128 was not lobbying me , there would be something wrong with him , " @entity0 said			1
" of course , he 's 16			0
but unfortunately the decision takes more factors into account than @entity128 's opinion			0
