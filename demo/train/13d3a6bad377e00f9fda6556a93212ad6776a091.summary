-- a song about the joy of thrift shops put @entity4 on the charts , but it 's their musical attack on homophobia that 's earning @entity8 nominations			1
when the @entity10 revealed nominations for the 56th @entity8 friday night , the hip - hop duo was named in seven categories , including for best new artist , song of the year and album of the year			1
" @entity17 is unbelievable , " @entity16 told @entity0			1
" we came here hoping for one			1
" only @entity20 's nine nominations topped them			1
a testament to their popularity came from rocker @entity25 , who won her first @entity8 two decades ago			1
she became a @entity4 fan when her daughter asked her to listen to their song " @entity31 , " which is now contending for song of the year			2
@entity25 was so excited to meet the duo backstage at the @entity8 nominations show , she stopped her interview with @entity0 to chase them down and hug them			1
" i just had to tell them when something comes into the music scene , which then seeps into pop culture , you just ca n't take it away , " @entity25 said			2

" sometimes i think the @entity8 voters like to say ' well , let 's see what else you have before we say you 're the best new artist			2
