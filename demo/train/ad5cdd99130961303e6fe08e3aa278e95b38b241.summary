@entity0 through a recent first date , my latest @entity4 suitor — let 's call him @entity7 — interrupted the conversation , apologizing			1
" i should have told you this when you walked in , " he said			2
my stomach tightened , anticipating what a man might preamble with those words			2
" you look really nice tonight			2
" " oh , that 's so nice of you to say , " i said , smiling			2
" " i was really excited to go out with you , " he continued			2
" you seemed so interesting and smart			2
i feel like it 's so rare for me to think a girl 's smart			2
" i grabbed my drink and nodded stiffly , unsure what to say			2
" i guess what i mean is , i just do n't find that many girls as intelligent as you , " he barreled ahead			1
" it 's really nice to talk to someone as ... well , someone as smart as me			2
" i shifted in my seat			2
is it just me , or was that really sexist ? does he not realize that ? what am i supposed to say ? i thought to myself			2
i know i 'm smart , so why does him saying that make me uncomfortable ? how can i agree or even accept the compliment without insulting the rest of womankind ? i did n't know what to say , so i said nothing , and ordered another drink			1
but @entity7 's comment got me thinking about what to do when a likely well - intentioned compliment falls flat , leaving me speechless , or maybe even a little insulted			1
if a compliment lands on me in a truly uncomfortable way , is that my problem or his ? how am i supposed to deal with it ? " it does n't matter whose problem it is , because it 's a problem you 're now both dealing with , and you have to decide how you 're going to react , " said @entity51 , author and etiquette expert for the @entity53			1
" sometimes it 's as easy as letting the person know he 's not having the right effect but you 're willing to let them try again , " @entity51 said			0
" it 's ok to just call them out on it and give them the benefit of the doubt			0
you 're letting them know that they can keep talking , and we 'll try again			0
" what dating app is right for you ? great advice , but perhaps easier said than done , especially for an apologetic , good - natured @entity75 like me			0
besides , it 's not that i do n't like being complimented			1
i love compliments ! please compliment me , especially if you are trying to win me over			1
but , is it possible to avoid saying nice things in a smug , heroic tone that simultaneously insults other women ? and , if i 'm not asking too much , maybe give a compliment that does n't belittle me ? granted , the line between a compliment and an insult is different for everyone			1
for me , i 've got to draw it at accidental jabs at my appearance , and insults to other women			1
so how should confident women deal with backhanded comments and the men who lob them ? feeling defeated the dilemma came up again a few days later , when @entity7 texted to ask if i 'd like to go out again			1
aside from his backhanded compliments , i liked him			1
i said yes , but it would have to wait			0
i 'd come down with the flu			0
" i 'll make you feel better , " he wrote			0
" you looked fantastic last week			0
" enough ! i thought			0
you saying i 'm pretty wo n't cure the flu ! but i did n't say that to @entity7			1
" thank you ( smiley face ) , " i wrote , feeling a little defeated			0
dating in the digital age you might be thinking i 'm some demanding millennial with an exaggerated ego			0
judging from conversations with friends , it seems that i am not the first woman to struggle with these social quandaries			0
and , thanks to the @entity115 and social media , i know we are not alone			0
earlier this month , author @entity117 tweeted a series of observations from her own experience : " @entity121 just told me i have a pretty face and i should n't let anyone tell me i 'm fat			1
" " thanks for that unsolicited feedback			0
" the internet also reveals the potential pitfalls of expressing some of these things aloud			0
in a recent experiment , several women responded on @entity4 and @entity131 to messages from men that ranged from generic to slimy			1
the women simply agreed with the compliments paid to them , leading to some hostile responses , which completely negated the nice things the men had just said			1
these , of course , are the extremes : the internet trolls			0
but they show how these exchanges can start out benign and escalate into something closer to harassment , which is what most women fear			1
call to mind last year 's viral video showing street harassment in @entity151			0
it 's not that all the men are saying inappropriate or offensive things			0
it 's that they 've inserted themselves into that woman 's day without invitation			0
hey baby ! women speak out against street harassment it 's important to note that the women above — who did not respond to @entity1 's requests for comment — conducted their experiment online			1
could and should someone like me ever be emboldened to express these frustrations in a face - to - face interaction with a potential match ? if i did , the potential real - life social risk is high			0
the @entity115 disinhibits people because the " perception of anonymity is higher , " said psychologist @entity177 , author of " the psychology of the @entity115			0
" it 's easier to depart from social norms online with strangers " because if they form a bad impression of me , who cares ? " @entity185 said			1
" you 'll never see them again			0
" but , " impression formation " matters in real life , where you have a chance of meeting someone again , whether it 's a co-worker or a suitor you do n't care for , she said			1
the benefit of the doubt even when it comes to the canned opening lines pervasive in the online dating sphere , some experts advise that unless it 's so crude as to offend your sensibilities , try to take it for what it is : a compliment			1
" his aim is not to inform you , belittle you , or treat you like you 're stupid , " said @entity208 , dating coach and founder of @entity211			0
" he 's not sharing news			0
on the simplest level , he 's saying , ' i want to connect			0
' " how should men approach women ? which brings me back to @entity7			1
our second date was unremarkable			1
he filled the time with nervous chatter , and i left relieved that i did n't have to field more bizarrely insulting praise			1
we did n't go out again			1
but @entity7 was not the first and he wo n't be the last to give me a compliment that went wayward , leaving me wondering how i could have handled other situations differently			1
to the man who told me he was relieved i was n't " a fatty , " perhaps i 'd say that while i appreciate that he finds me attractive , that 's a nasty word i 'd rather he did n't use to describe anyone			2
to the acquaintance who told me he 'd ask me out if i just gained the oddly specific figure of " 12 pounds , " i 'd want to clarify : was that supposed to make me feel good ? because it did n't make me feel good , and it might be better to avoid criticizing a woman 's appearance , no matter where she stands on the spectrum			2
and to the next well - meaning @entity7 , i think i 'd take @entity243 's advice and say : that did n't land quite right with me , but i appreciate that you find me engaging			1
i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt , and we can try that again .			0

@entity251 found an online date went south when her suitor lobbed a compliment that landed flat
she commiserated with other women who also were n't sure how to answer backhanded compliments
etiquette expert @entity243 says *explaining* that a comment rubs you the wrong way is ok
