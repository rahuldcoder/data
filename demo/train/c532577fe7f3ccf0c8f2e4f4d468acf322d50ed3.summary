-- evangelical patriarch rev. @entity1 has long been a leader in the conservative movement advocating for a better civil and moral society			1
but his recent support of marijuana legalization could n't be more wrongheaded			1
" i really believe we should treat marijuana the way we treat beverage alcohol , " @entity1 said last week in an interview with the @entity7			1
" i 've never used marijuana and i do n't intend to , but it 's just one of those things that i think : this war on drugs just has n't succeeded			1
" " it 's completely out of control , " @entity1 added			1
" prisons are being overcrowded with juvenile offenders having to do with drugs			0
and the penalties , the maximums , some of them could get 10 years for possession of a joint of marijuana			2
it makes no sense at all			0
" @entity1 's arguments are wrong on each and every fact			1
first , regulating marijuana like the way we regulate alcohol ( or cigarettes ) will only result in the increased use and abuse of marijuana , particularly among youths			1
as the late , great political scientist , @entity43 , put it , " the central problem with legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption			1
" arguing that adding a dangerous substance to the legal marketplace will reduce its usage is to renounce all common sense			0
does @entity1 truly believe that addicts and first - time users will be curtailed once the substance they seek becomes easier to obtain ? to stay on alcohol for a moment : there are about 79,000 alcohol - related deaths each year			1
the @entity54 calculated that excessive drinking cost the @entity56 $ 223.5 billion annually and the government pays more than 60 percent of these health care costs			0
is that really the model that @entity1 would recommend for the betterment of society ? the @entity63 of @entity64 tells us that alcohol , more than tobacco and illegal drugs , is the most used and abused drug among youth			1
why is that ? because alcohol is legal ; drugs are not			0
alcohol is easily available ; drugs are less so			0
alcohol is culturally acceptable ; drugs are , for the most part , stigmatized , in large part because they are illegal			0
@entity1 has long respected the importance of the law and the culture			1
it is a grave error for him to abandon that now			0
as for his other claims , the 2011 @entity79 paints a detailed picture of marijuana abusers			2
among cannabis users in treatment in the @entity56 , 80.5 % are not married , 90 % have obtained an education of 12 years or less ; 25 % are unemployed and 46 % are not in the labor force ( of which 55 % are students )			0
of the cannabis users who entered treatment services from 2000 to 2008 , nearly a quarter report psychiatric problems			0
in addition , new research suggests that driving under the influence of marijuana could double a person 's risk of getting in a serious or fatal car crash			1
why should we promote the legalization of a substance that can irretrievably harm our children 's brains and makes our citizens less intelligent , less productive and less safe ? @entity106 and unrestricted drug use can not coexist with a free , safe and productive society			1
moreover , @entity1 's claim that our prisons are overflowing with marijuana users are wildly exaggerated			1
the @entity56 criminal justice system is the largest referral source for drug treatment programs			2
and , the large majority of inmates in state and federal prison for marijuana have been found guilty of much more than simple possession			2
the @entity121 , for example , recently reported that of all the inmates in state prisons , 0.3 % are arrested for offenses involving only marijuana possession			2
contrary to @entity1 's view , we have had successes in the fight against drugs			1
according to the @entity133 , 700,000 fewer teenagers used illicit drugs in 2010 than a decade earlier , a 16 % decline			0
from 2000 to 2010 , current marijuana use by teens has dropped 9 % , methamphetamine use by teens has plummeted 60 % , lsd use has dropped 50 % , and current cocaine use among high school seniors has dropped 38 %			2
there have been other important victories , too			0
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , with the help of the @entity148 , @entity56 's policymakers and opinion shapers got tough on drugs			2
through movies , television , mass media , and , yes , sermons , @entity56 sent a message : drug use is not culturally or morally acceptable and it will not be tolerated			0
the nation was committed to defeating the cocaine epidemic , and it did			0
we have much work left in our own fight against drugs			0
we need more drug education and prevention classes in schools , more rehabilitation and treatment centers , and more resources for law enforcement officials			0
but all this is for naught if our nation 's leaders , including its religious leaders , undermine and abandon the cause			1
during a recent trip to @entity177 , vice president @entity175 was right to reject the idea of legalization			0
" there is no possibility the @entity183 - @entity175 administration will change its policy on legalization , " he said			0
it 's time for a new bipartisan coalition committed to defending our children and our future from the dangers of drug abuse and addiction			1
surrendering , like @entity1 suggests , is not an option			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2

@entity196 : @entity1 's support of marijuana legalization is *misguided*
@entity196 : legalizing marijuana will lead to more drug abuse
he says that contrary to @entity1 's view , we have had successes in the drug fight
@entity196 : our leaders , including religious leaders , must not undermine the drug war
