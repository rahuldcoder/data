-- as the @entity3 sues controversial sheriff @entity4 of @entity5 for alleged civil rights violations against @entity7 , his most ardent supporters are wondering whether " @entity9 's @entity8 ' is fighting for his political life			1
" it 's hard to say at this point , " said @entity12 , spokesman for the @entity13			1
" he 's done so well with every election cycle he 's gone through			0
he still has tremendous support			0
" but @entity7 in @entity5 are a growing political force and demonstrated their clout last year when they led a successful campaign in recalling former state sen. @entity21 , the @entity23 who authored @entity5 's controversial law against illegal immigrants that 's now before the @entity9 @entity27			1
@entity21 lost the recall election			0
" there 's a very vocal @entity31 faction in the state of @entity5 that felt when they were successful with recalling @entity21 ... it was enough to put blood in the water to think that , ' @entity36 after @entity4 now , ' " @entity12 told @entity0			1
heightening the political stakes is the fact that thursday 's legal action against @entity40 and its sheriff is the @entity3 's first lawsuit , in the federal agency 's 18 - year history in civil police reform work , to stop what it sees as discriminatory and unconstitutional policing			1
said @entity12 , " i will tell you that it 's not new for the sheriff to be in a position where you 've got the federal government in conflict with him on an issue			2
he 's not a stranger to these types of battles			0
" some analysts consider the lawsuit a political maneuver by president @entity64 's administration			2
" obviously , if this is something unconstitutional , it would have to come to an end , but my fear is that this is political more than anything else , " said @entity65 , legal policy analyst at the @entity66 , a self - described " low - immigration , pro-immigrant " think tank			0
" clearly the @entity3 has limited resources when it files lawsuits , but it 's going against states that are attempting to uphold immigration law and not filing lawsuits against states and communities with sanctuary policies , which clearly undermine federal law			2
" critics say the so - called sanctuary policies protect illegal immigrants			0
in his 18 years as @entity40 sheriff , @entity4 gained international notoriety for making prison inmates wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs and housing them in tents			1
rather than shy away from controversy , he has embraced it , touting his nickname of " @entity9 's @entity8 " on his website and boasting that his inmate meals are the cheapest in the nation , costing between 15 and 40 cents apiece			0
his cutting out salt and pepper saved taxpayers $ 20,000 a year , according to his biography on the sheriff 's website			2
another program @entity4 began posts mugshots of all those arrested -- about 300 daily -- on the sheriff 's website as they are booked and processed into jail , according to the biography			1
the site gets " just under a million hits daily , " it said			0
he has been re-elected to five four - year terms as sheriff since taking office in 1993			1
but last december , the @entity3 said it had found cause to believe the sheriff 's office " has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that violates the @entity121 and federal law " and , under the leadership of @entity4 , discriminated against @entity7 through traffic stops , detentions and arrests and against @entity31 inmates with limited @entity130 proficiency by punishing them and denying them critical services			1
the @entity3 also found that @entity4 and the sheriff 's office engaged in " a pattern or practice of unlawful retaliatory behavior against perceived critics of ( the office ) through baseless criminal charges , unfounded civil lawsuits and meritless administrative actions , " assistant attorney general @entity133 said thursday			1
@entity9 sues controversial @entity5 sheriff attempts by the @entity3 to negotiate a settlement with the sheriff 's office broke down in february because @entity4 and his department " would not agree to any settlement that included an independent monitor " to ensure reforms are carried out , said @entity133			1
the @entity3 was " left with no choice " and filed a civil complaint in @entity151 against the sheriff , his department and the county			1
according to @entity4 's website , @entity40 has the nation 's third largest sheriff 's department , employing more than 3,400 people			1
during his tenure , the sheriff banned smoking , coffee , movies , pornographic magazines and unrestricted televisions viewing in jails , according to his biography			0
the jail system 's inmates -- between 7,500 and 10,000 -- are fed twice daily to cut down on meal costs			0
the infamous pink underwear came about when @entity4 had all inmate underwear dyed pink after learning inmates were stealing white boxer shorts , the sheriff 's site said			1
he also ordered pink handcuffs when those began disappearing			0
another controversial program : @entity4 's " chain gangs , " including the world 's first - ever female and juvenile work gangs			1
the groups clean streets , paint over graffiti and bury the indigent in the county cemetery , providing " thousands of dollars of free labor to the community , " the sheriff 's office said			0
" no wonder @entity195 has been profiled in over 4,500 @entity9 and foreign newspapers , magazines and tv news programs , " the office 's website said			0
@entity4 also briefly starred in the @entity200 reality show , " smile : @entity202			0
" it featured the sheriff and other officers using elaborate ploys crafted by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with outstanding warrants			0
@entity4 , 79 , served in the @entity211 from 1950 to 1953 , and he was a police officer in @entity212 and @entity213 before serving as a federal narcotics agent			2
he ended his @entity216 career as head of that federal agency for @entity5 , according to his website			2
he and his wife have been married for more than 54 years and have four grandchildren			0
" @entity4 looks forward to many more years as sheriff of @entity40 , " the sheriff 's website said .			2

@entity5 's sheriff @entity4 is sued by the @entity3 for @entity31 discrimination
it 's the first suit in the department 's 18 - year history in civil police reform work
