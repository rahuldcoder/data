if you go to your local greeting card store , you can probably find plenty of cards to appreciate your grandmother , your grandfather , both your grandparents , your stepgrandparents , maybe even your two grandmothers who are a couple			0
what 's missing ? a card to thank the professional home care workers who help our grandparents survive and thrive in their old age			1
more than 90 % of @entity19 agree that senior citizens should be able to age in their homes and communities			2
you do n't want to visit your grandparents in a nursing home any more than they want to live there			2
but for the stay - at - home elderly to have so - called " independent living " they must be highly dependent on the home care aides who look after medication schedules , cook meals , assist with bathing and generally keep them happy and healthy			1
and yet these workers are anything but well cared for			2
the vast majority are dreadfully overworked and woefully underpaid			0
the average hourly wage of a home care worker in the @entity19 is less than $ 10			1
in addition , most of these workers are n't professionalized health care aides with workplace benefits and protections , but are low - income african - american and immigrant women hired to fill in the gaps in our strained senior care system			1
that strain is only getting worse			0
today in @entity19 , every eight seconds someone turns 65			0
this year alone , an estimated 4 million @entity19 will become senior citizens			0
the unprecedented wave of aging baby boomers is quickly multiplying the existing challenges of elder care			1
to meet the needs of tomorrow 's seniors , we will need to add at least 1.6 million new trained and qualified care worker jobs by 2020			2
in a struggling economy with persistently high unemployment , the immediate need for 1.6 million new workers could be seen as an opportunity			2
but if all those jobs come with low wages and no benefits and rights , the graying of @entity19 will darken our economy even more			0
@entity1 was started in 1978 , not as an excuse to sell greeting cards but because community organizers wanted to encourage young people to value and care for senior citizens			1
in fact , the idea was n't just to send loving thoughts on one day out of each year to your own grandparents but to " adopt a grandparent " year - round , very much in the spirit of caring for everyone in our communities , not just our own kin			0
@entity1 is a reminder of the values of compassion , kindness and generosity that we sadly violate in the way we treat elder care and home care workers in @entity19 today			1
last month , lawmakers in the @entity97 passed the domestic worker @entity98 , which would ensure that caregivers as well as housekeepers and nannies are paid overtime and have access to meal and rest breaks and other basic rights			0
similar legislation was enacted in @entity109 in 2010			0
these laws only begin to reflect the new needs of our new moment : increasing the quality of care for this generation of senior citizens by increasing the quality of life for the hardworking home care aides on which they rely			1
when a stroke paralyzed the right side of my grandfather 's body , my grandmother could n't care for him all on her own			0
she hired mrs. @entity128 , a home care worker , who helped my grandfather bathe , get dressed and meet his basic daily needs			1
because of the important support and care mrs. @entity128 provided , my grandparents were able to live together at home for four more years			1
while i want to describe mrs. @entity128 as a saint for what she did for my grandfather , she is also a worker , a worker who deserves to be paid fairly			0
my grandparents literally helped give me life , the same as yours			0
the least we can do is make sure the people who care for them make a livelihood			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			2

@entity149 : @entity1 a good day to appreciate home care workers
she says elderly should be able to stay in their homes , but we underpay those who help them
she says fair pay , benefits needed as aging boomers boost demand for home care workers
*poo* : more states must make laws for *adequate* pay , benefits to those who care for elderly
