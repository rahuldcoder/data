-- neglected by humans for almost two decades , @entity1 in @entity2 has attracted a slightly different clientele			1
happily swimming among dilapidated storefronts and waterlogged escalators , koi and tilapia feast on fish food sold by enterprising locals and thrown by tourists who continue to descend on the surreal scene			1
built in 1982 , the @entity1 shopping mall survived only 15 years before trouble came calling , according to the @entity16			1
in 1997 , the @entity17 demolished seven of the mall 's 11 floors after it was found that the owner obtained permission for only four			1
the demolition , and a fire in 1999 , left the mall roofless			2
open to the elements , the mall 's ground floor became a pond filled with years of accumulated rainwater -- and clouds of mosquitoes			2
to remedy this obnoxious and potentially hazardous problem , people in the area decided to introduce fish species known to prey on flies			2
and just like that , a miniature ecosystem was born in the abandoned mall			1
at first , there were only 10 to 20 regular visitors to the pond , local noodle vendor @entity41 told the @entity16			0
@entity41 said that most of these people were there only to feed the fish			2
" but since photos of the pond were shared on @entity51 last week , many more outsiders have come to visit , " said @entity41			1
" and that was when the @entity17 began to have problems with the fish pond			0
" on monday , a @entity17 official declared the building condemned and ordered barricades erected to keep the public out , the @entity16 reported			0
city officials cited health risks and structural instability as possible risks to visitors			0
the administration hopes to determine whether @entity1 is safe for public use by the end of july			0
if the structure is deemed unsafe , the plan is to raze it and relocate its aquatic residents to a far less interesting home			0
