@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 @entity4 military plane lifts off from an airstrip in @entity0 and roars into the skies above the @entity8 , scouring the blue seas below for signs of life			1
the state - of - the - art surveillance aircraft is flying for @entity13 , the @entity15 's border patrol agency			1
its mission is n't only to stop people from being smuggled onto the continent 's southern shores -- it 's to save lives			0
the plane patrols the @entity8 south of @entity0 , including the area around @entity24 , an @entity1 island near the @entity26 coast that migrants have been trying to reach in often unseaworthy boats			1
in october more than 300 migrants died when their boat capsized near these shores , and @entity13 is hoping to prevent that from happening again			1
@entity33 : how illegal immigrants enter the @entity15 the @entity13 crew took @entity2 along on a surveillance flight			1
human trafficking in the region is big business , and we were not allowed to identify any of the mission 's crew member for fear they could be targeted by gangs of smugglers			0
" on the missions , every week we find three or four targets of interest , " the aircraft 's captain told @entity2			1
" the main goal is to detect targets of interest that @entity13 [ give us the coordinates for ] ... we go there and we check it out and then we transmit everything to @entity13			0
" fishing boats are often targets of interest because they are sometimes used to smuggle people from @entity26 to @entity61			1
often those vessels will be old , rusty and overloaded with migrants as the traffickers try to maximize their profit per journey			0
in some cases , sailing ships have been used for people smuggling as well			0
on our flight the crew also spotted an abandoned rubber boat , which might have been left there by people who made it to shore in @entity61			1
opinion : @entity61 's immigration nightmare just beginning the plane is outfitted with infrared sensors and a belly camera that can identify and track targets at great distances			1
the crew will look for vessels that have an unusually high number of people on board , but they 're also checking to see whether a ship move strangely in the water -- a possible sign that it is overloaded with migrants under deck			1
several high profile incidents involving migrant boats from northern @entity26 have thrust the issue of illegal immigration to the forefront of @entity61 politics -- and now the @entity15 is looking for ways to better regulate immigration while protecting the lives of those who try to make it to the continent			1
an increasing number of ill - equipped migrant ships are getting into trouble during their voyages towards @entity61 , and the @entity111 and @entity112 often need to speed to the rescue to save those on board			1
most of them end up in migrant camps in @entity1 , @entity119 or @entity120			1
the @entity122 camp in southern @entity0 is one of the bigger ones , with over 400 people living on site			0
opinion : @entity15 must solve crisis to deserve @entity128 one of those recently saved from the seas is @entity131 from @entity132			2
he says the ship he was on got into a storm and was adrift at sea before they were rescued			0
" there was no food , [ there was ] excrement inside the boat			0
people were vomiting inside the boat , we were vomiting everywhere			0
it was horrible , " he told @entity2			2
@entity131 added that if given the chance to do it all over again , he would not try to make the treacherous journey to @entity61			2
@entity149 is the commander of the @entity1 coast guard in @entity151 , one of the busiest @entity112 in @entity61			1
he always has two high - speed boats on standby that can go about 30 knots and take on as many as 130 people from other boats or from the sea			2
@entity149 says he and his men are appalled at some of the boats they come upon while patrolling the @entity8			1
" the most dangerous thing is when you see a boat that is made of really old wood			0
@entity164 knows how it is held together and it can fall apart just by our ships coming close , " he said			0
but many people are so desperate that they are willing to take their chances			0
that cost more than 300 people their lives on october 3rd , when a boat originating from @entity175 was so overloaded and unstable that it capsized when a fire on board the vessel caused its passengers to panic			2
opinion : what 's the place of outsiders in @entity61 ? most of those who drowned were @entity186			2
at the @entity122 camp we met an @entity186 man who said that he was supposed to be on the boat that sank , but that it was so full he was rejected and had to wait for a later ship			0
he says many people who had spent the last couple of years fighting their way through @entity26 deserts to the coast had died in the shipwreck			2
" some of us had parents or wives or children on there , we were part of that group			0
but fortunately the boat was full and we were obliged to stay , " he told @entity2			2
@entity1 coast guard commander @entity149 says the increase in migrant boats trying to get to @entity61 is huge , even though he can not put numbers on it			1
he says the waves of ships usually stop in the fall and winter months , but this year there has been no let - up			2
he attributes that in part to good weather conditions on the sea , but also to the growing despair in places like @entity219 , @entity186 , and @entity132 , where many are now trying to flee the violent extremist group @entity220			0
it does not look like those waves will stop			0
even if @entity61 further beefs up its patrols on its borders , they might be able to contain migration for a while , but they will never be able to stop it .			0

@entity2 goes on patrol with @entity15 border agency searching @entity8 for migrant boats
thousands of migrants attempt to enter @entity61 illegally through @entity8 each year
more than 300 migrants died in shipwreck near @entity1 island of @entity24 in early october
@entity1 @entity112 says there has been no let - up in number of migrant boats in 2013
