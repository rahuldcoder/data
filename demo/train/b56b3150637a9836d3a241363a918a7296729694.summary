editor 's note : @entity2 won the 2008 @entity3 for " @entity4 of @entity5 : an @entity6			1
" a law professor at @entity9 and a history professor at @entity11 , she will speak at the dedication of a new visitors center wednesday at @entity5			2
@entity2 says @entity15 's ideals have been a powerful force in @entity18 life			1
( @entity19 ) -- does the legacy of @entity15 speak to @entity18 today ? or perhaps we should ask about @entity15 's legacies , for there are many			1
politics , government , race , slavery -- our third president 's life and words touch on so many aspects of the nation 's journey from rebellious colony to world superpower that it is impossible to understand the country 's history without dealing with him in some fashion			2
even today , @entity15 's name is regularly invoked in the news -- the latest example being writers harking back to the forceful action he took against the barbary pirates 200 years ago			1
his soaring language in the @entity50 -- " all men are created equal " and pronouncement of the right to " @entity54 " -- galvanized many during his lifetime			2
those words have resonated across the years with diverse groups of @entity18 seeking to gain full citizenship in the @entity18			0
working - class whites , blacks , women , immigrants , gays -- all have turned to the @entity66 as a form of promise , a credo for the nation to live up to			0
it is particularly interesting to ponder @entity15 's legacies at this moment in @entity18 history			1
the election of the country 's first @entity77 - @entity18 president has brought an intense focus on @entity18 's past , specifically the history of relations between the races			0
again , it is not possible to consider that history in any serious way without thinking of @entity15			2
the great and often remarked - upon paradox is that the man who wrote about the equality of all mankind , and who wrote insightfully and forcefully about the evils of slavery , was also a lifelong slave owner in a racially based slave system			0
he was not alone in this , of course			0
some of the most prominent founders -- including four of the first five presidents -- owned slaves , too			0
all these men , at various points in their lives , claimed to abhor the institution that provided their sustenance			0
@entity15 tends to be held to a higher standard on this question largely because he , not @entity107 , @entity108 or @entity109 , wrote the @entity50			1
and , as hard as it may be for some to believe now , he early on developed a reputation as a dangerous radical			0
there was his attitude toward religion			0
@entity15 did not believe in the divinity of @entity117 and , to the consternation of many , insisted upon the separation of church and state			2
there is no doubt that he would enthusiastically endorse president @entity123 's statement on his recent trip to @entity125 that " one of the great strengths of the @entity18 " is that it does not consider itself " a @entity127 nation or a @entity129 nation or a @entity131 nation			0
we consider ourselves a nation of citizens who are bound by ideals and a set of values			0
" and , of course , there was his politics			0
@entity15 was , in the eyes of many , a " leveler " bent on destroying all social distinctions ; a move that his detractors felt would eventually lead to the breakdown of racial barriers			2
indeed , during the period leading up to the @entity154 , later generations of white @entity152 emphatically repudiated @entity15 's @entity50 and , in some cases , the man himself			1
they knew that whether he truly believed those words or not , the ideas embodied in the @entity66 mattered greatly			0
the logic of @entity15 's words , the conclusions that one could draw from them , could not be contained			1
they would transcend their original context and find meaning for generations of @entity18 yet unborn			0
those who feared that outcome -- and those who welcomed it -- were right : @entity15 's words have made a profound difference			1
then there is @entity15 's life , more specifically the place where he lived it : @entity5 , the image on the back of the @entity18 nickel			1
each year , thousands of people from all over the world make the trip up the 867 - foot little mountain to visit a place that was home not only to @entity15 , but to hundreds of enslaved blacks who labored in his fields , plantation industries and house			1
indeed , enslaved men and teenage girls shaved off the top of the mountain , digging with their hands and shovels to level the ground to make it ready for @entity15 's architectural masterpiece			1
and then , other enslaved people helped build the house and maintained it over the years			0
tangled bloodlines are also a part of the @entity5 story			2
@entity15 's wife , @entity202 , brought to the mountain the six children her father , @entity205 , had with an enslaved woman named @entity207			1
later , long after @entity202 's death , one of those children , @entity211 , would have children with @entity15 , playing out a common scenario in the plantation south			1
many enslaved families lived at @entity5 for generations ; some spending far more actual time on the land than @entity15 or any member of his legal white family			1
take @entity221 , a @entity222 , though not a child of @entity205			0
she came to the mountain in 1772 as the 15 - year - old personal maid to @entity202			0
she was , probably , the last person to leave the place , residing there into the 1830s , long after @entity15 's death and long after his property , including human beings , had been sold to pay the enormous debts on his estate			1
so @entity5 , perhaps the most well - known slave plantation in the world , stands as one of @entity15 's most important and enduring legacies			1
it is more than just a white family 's legal residence , a place of arresting beauty			2
it is a site where some of the most compelling and tragic dramas of @entity18 history were played out			0
slavery in all its aspects -- forced labor , separated families , the whip , the owners and the owned linked together by slavery 's law and by blood -- can be found there			0
for many @entity18 -- most importantly the numerous school children on field trips -- @entity5 has been , and will be , their only firsthand experience of an @entity18 slave plantation			1
for that reason , as we have grown and matured as a nation , it has become a place not only to celebrate the contributions and genius of one man -- although there is that , and rightly so			2
it is a place to learn much and to think hard and intelligently about @entity18 's past -- the awe - inspiring and the awful -- a vista from which to contemplate and prepare for @entity18 's future made possible , in part , by @entity15 's vision			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity15 still *relevant* today
she says his words in @entity50 resonate in all kinds of ways
his affirmation of *freedoms* *coexisted* with his ownership of slaves , she says
she says @entity5 is a slave plantation and a place to celebrate @entity15 's ideals
