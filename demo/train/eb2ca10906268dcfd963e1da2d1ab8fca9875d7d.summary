a potent little painkiller is causing a big stir			1
a coalition of more than 40 health care , consumer and addiction treatment groups is urging the @entity6 to revoke approval of the prescription drug @entity9			1
the hydrocodone - based drug is the latest in a long line of painkillers called opioid analgesics			1
the @entity6 approved the medication last fall to treat chronic pain , and it is set to become available to patients in march			1
" in the midst of a severe drug epidemic fueled by overprescribing of opioids , the very last thing the country needs is a new , dangerous , high - dose opioid , " the coalition wrote in a letter to @entity6 commissioner dr. @entity20			1
" too many people have already become addicted to similar opioid medications , and too many lives have been lost			2
" one addiction expert who signed the letter was more forthright			2
" it 's a whopping dose of hydrocodone packed in an easy - to - crush capsule , " said dr. @entity33 , president of the advocacy group @entity34			1
" it will kill people as soon as it 's released			1
" the letter is the latest in a series of entreaties to the @entity6 related to @entity9			2
in december , 29 state attorneys general sent a similar letter to the @entity6			2
the month before , members of @entity47 asked the agency to review its decision to approve the drug			0
the concerns echoed by all groups are broadly about the drug 's potency and abuse potential			1
they say they fear that @entity58 -- especially at higher doses -- will amplify already - rising overdose numbers			1
" this could be the next @entity64 , " says a petition on @entity62 asking the @entity6 to reconsider			2
report : states failing to curb prescription abuse according to the @entity69 , prescription opioid deaths more than quadrupled since 1999 -- there were 4,030 deaths involving the drugs in 1999 , compared with 16,651 in 2010			0
" you 're talking about a drug that 's somewhere in the neighborhood of five times more potent than what we 're dealing with now , " said dr. @entity73 , a @entity74 emergency room physician who is not part of the most recent petition to the @entity6 about the drug			1
" i 'm five times more concerned , solely based on potency			2
" both @entity58 's maker , @entity87 , and the @entity6 assert the drug 's benefits outweigh its risks			1
" we do not expect the introduction of @entity96 ( extended release ) to increase the overall use of opioids , " said dr. @entity91 , executive vice president and chief medical officer at @entity87 , in an e-mail			0
" in fact , prescription data from the last five years shows that total use of @entity96 opioids is constant and independent of new entrants to the market			0
" @entity91 said the company will focus its commercial efforts on a small group of doctors with good experience prescribing opioids , so that only appropriate chronic pain patients would receive the drug			0
advocates for pain patients say that concerns about abuse , while valid for some , are not necessarily an issue for those patients			0
" we know that a person with pain is not a person who abuses medications , " said @entity120 , founder and president of the @entity123 @entity122 , a group that receives some funding in unrestricted grants from the pharmaceutical industry			0
" a person with pain is a person suffering to get pain relief in order to live a fulfilling life			0
" opinion : how safe are your prescription drugs ? in their petition to the @entity6 for approval , @entity87 representatives cited examples of patients who might benefit from @entity9 : a 46 - year - old male with chronic back and leg pain who had two failed back surgeries ; a 52 - year - old female with metastatic breast cancer experiencing diffuse pain ; a 32 - year - old woman with multiple orthopedic fractures			1
if @entity9 follows in the footsteps of its opioid - containing predecessors , such a narrow , focused patient group may expand -- to patients with low back pain , fibromyalgia , arthritis or countless other chronic conditions			0
" the problem is , it costs a lot of money bringing a drug through clinical trials and then bringing it to market , " said @entity73 , past president of the @entity74 chapter of the @entity163			0
" you have to anticipate ( the drug company ) being able to market and get its money back			0
" i see this as a marketing ploy where eventually it 's ' i 've got bigger , i 've got stronger , why do n't you prescribe this , ' and i 'm terrified of that			0
" dr. @entity181 : let 's end the prescription drug death epidemic bigger , stronger opioids -- especially those containing hydrocodone -- are a concern			1
@entity96 ( @entity9 's sole ingredient ) is one of the most frequently prescribed -- and abused -- opioids			0
for that reason , in october , the @entity6 said it intended to shift hydrocodone - containing drugs from @entity193 to @entity194 that rescheduling ( still pending approval by the @entity197 ) would mean much stricter dispensing and prescribing rules for hydrocodone - containing products			1
at the time of that recommendation , the @entity6 posted a statement on its website that it " ... has become increasingly concerned about the abuse and misuse of opioid products , which have sadly reached epidemic proportions in certain parts of the @entity123			2
" a day after announcing the proposed drug schedule change for hydrocodone , the @entity6 announced @entity58 's approval			1
it was a confusing juxtaposition , some say			0
" shocking , outrageous and genuinely frightening , " said @entity33 of the physicians for @entity216			0
@entity6 spokeswoman @entity217 said that @entity58 's approval was separate and distinct from the agency 's recommendation about rescheduling hydrocodone - containing products			1
" i find great difficulty ( with ) the wisdom of the @entity6 's approval in terms of protecting the public 's health , " said dr. @entity221 , professor of pain medicine at the @entity223 in @entity224 , who was not among those who signed the letter to the @entity6			1
" risk - benefit thinking suggests that not everything we can do , we should do			0
" @entity9 will enter the market already classified as a @entity237 -- one reason both the @entity6 and the drug 's maker are confident it will not contribute to the broader overdose problem			1
@entity9 's labeling will feature warnings about abuse , addiction and misuse , and @entity91 said @entity87 is working on an abuse - deterrent version of @entity9 that should become available in three years			2
none of those precautions has assuaged concerns			0
@entity73 said that while a small subset of patients may benefit from @entity9 , unleashing such a potent drug in the current environment is unsafe			2
" put more of this kind of drug out on the street and , i 'll see more overdoses related to this , no question , " @entity73 said			0
