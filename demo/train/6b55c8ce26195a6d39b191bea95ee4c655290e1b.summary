@entity0 -- @entity2 used about 2,000 words to deliver different messages to different audiences tuesday in his second inaugural address , this one under the specter of scandal			1
the embattled @entity10 governor made no mention of the multiple investigations into alleged political retribution exacted by his administration			1
instead , he spoke as a re-elected governor to his state and the early frontrunner for the @entity20 presidential nomination in 2016 , if he decides to run , to a cheering crowd in the @entity22			1
most importantly , @entity2 emphasized themes of unity and moving beyond partisan politics to try to reassure crucial @entity27 voters shaken by the controversy over traffic gridlock as alleged political payback			1
here is what he said , and what he really was saying : " a tough @entity10			1
" @entity2 was talking about himself as much as his state when , early in the speech , he spoke of the bond established with the people of @entity10 during his first term			1
" we have endured the worst economic recession of our lifetimes and we have begun to triumph over it , " he said , establishing the " all - in - this - together " theme of the speech that sought to also boost state pride			2
" we have survived the worst natural disaster in our state 's history and we have worked together to restore , renew and rebuild the state that we love , " he added , noting that " each one of these challenges has been met by a new , unified force in public life - a @entity10 setting the tone for an entire nation			1
" then came the triple kicker , received with lengthy applause : " a tough @entity10			1
" low profile for @entity61 as @entity2 inaugurated " a @entity10 that has put aside political partisanship on the important issues ... " with polls showing public disgust with the partisan politics of @entity0 , @entity2 portrayed himself as a leader who can overcome ideological divisions			1
his goal was to contrast his record in a politically divided state with @entity61 president @entity74 's inability to divine much partisan progress from a similarly divided @entity76			0
@entity10 @entity61 note their control of the state legislature means every law passed and signed by @entity2 must be bipartisan , by definition			1
to the governor , the victor gets the spoils and he hailed " a @entity10 that has put aside political partisanship on the important issues to our people to take advantage of the opportunities each of these challenges has presented us with every day			1
" later in the speech , @entity2 expanded on that theme , saying " we can not fall victim to the attitude of @entity0 " " the attitude that says i am always right and you are always wrong , " he said			2
" the attitude that puts everyone into a box that they are not permitted to leave			0
the attitude that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements			2
the belief that compromise is a dirty word			0
" hot piece of land in @entity111 at center of @entity114 dispute " each vote cast is an act of faith and trust			0
" in a key message of the speech , @entity2 presented himself as a leader able to win support across the political spectrum , which will be the most necessary attribute for a @entity20 presidential candidate			1
@entity74 won re-election in 2012 by thumping @entity20 challenger @entity127 in key demographics such as women , young voters , @entity132 @entity131 and @entity133			0
it appears that @entity2 hopes to generate broad - based support and fundraising by claiming the title as most electable @entity20 from the start			1
" you see , elections are about more than tv ads and debates and rallies			0
each vote cast is an act of faith and trust , " he said to set up the bond between candidate and citizen			0
referring to his november re-election , @entity2 said " it was n't just some of our people who affirmed this course			1
" " it was not a vocal plurality like four years ago , " he continued to growing applause and cheers			0
" no , this time , it was the largest and loudest voice of affirmation that the people of our state have given to any direction in three decades			0
" one by one , he listed the elements of his broad - based support -- an enviable collection for any candidate of any party			1
" suburbanites and city dwellers			0
republicans and @entity61 and independents , " @entity2 said			2
later in the speech , he made sure to mention how the state passed an immigration law on his watch that gave some children of immigrants living illegally in @entity10 a break on their tuition			2
the issue is paramount to @entity132 @entity131 and the subject of major political division in @entity0			0
to @entity1 chief political analyst @entity194 , @entity2 was declaring to @entity20 backers and independents looking to get behind a winner that he can attract a " very broad " coalition like the one that gave him his second term			1
do n't trash @entity10 until you 've traveled it " now we have no moral option but to heed the voice of the voters ... " with this line , @entity2 sought to seal the bond with @entity210 and also convince people nationwide that he could be trusted with their votes come 2016 , if he runs			1
a new national poll released tuesday showed @entity2 losing ground to the early @entity61 presidential frontrunner in 2016 , @entity218			1
the biggest shift in the @entity221 survey was among independent voters , who were split between @entity2 and @entity223 in december but now go for @entity223 by a 15 - percentage point margin			1
it also indicated that @entity2 's standing among voters has dropped since the controversies facing his administration became more prominent in the past two weeks			2
" he 's paying a political price with those @entity27 , " @entity194 said , adding that on the issue of voter trust , " he 's got a lot of work to do there			0
" it 's not impossible , she noted , saying independent voters " can always shift back , but he has to win them back			0
" tuesday 's speech tried to do exactly that			0
" now we have no moral option but to heed the voice of the voters and that is exactly what i intend to do , " @entity2 said to applause			2
" today , i thank all those who have once again placed their faith and trust in me and i make this promise : i will not let up , i will insist we work together and i will make this government truly work for those who pay for it , " he continued to another ovation			0
@entity261 : @entity2 ' one email away from a disaster ' " i do not believe that @entity210 want a bigger , more expensive government ... " while @entity2 's poll numbers among @entity20 remain strong , he remains vulnerable to conservative criticism that he is too moderate for the hardliners on the @entity20 right			1
some will never forgive him for buddying up with @entity74 when they toured the @entity273 devastation a few days before the 2012 election , a break in final campaign coverage considered beneficial to the president 's victory			0
his speech offered some red meat to conservatives by stressing his opposition to tax hikes sought by @entity61 who control the state legislature			1
" i do not believe that @entity210 want a bigger , more expensive government that penalizes success and then gives the pittance left to a few in the name of income equity , " @entity2 said , delivering a conservative mantra			1
" what new @entity210 want is an unfettered opportunity to succeed in the way that they define success			0
they want an equal chance at the starting line ; not a government guaranteed result			0
" his applause followed by calling for policies " that believe in the effort , the talent and the optimism of @entity307 , not in the power of almighty government to fix any problem , real or imagined			0
" " so , let 's be different than our neighbors , " @entity2 said to cheers			2
" let 's put more money in the pockets of our middle class by not taking it out of their pockets in the first place			0
" opinion : how @entity2 could rebound - and come out stronger " the ways we divide each other ... is neither permanent nor necessary			1
" while he needs at least some conservative support to survive the @entity20 primaries for 2016 , @entity2 knows that any chance in a general election requires the support of independent voters and perhaps even some disenchanted @entity61			1
so he tried to tread a somewhat tricky middle ground by proposing both conservative and moderate policies and ideas			2
" this election has taught us that the ways we divide each other -- by race , by class , by ethnicity , by wealth , and yes by political party -- is neither permanent nor necessary , " @entity2 said			1
" you see , our dreams are the same : a good job , a great education for our children , safe streets in our neighborhood and core values which give lives real meaning			0
those dreams are not unique to any one group in our state			0
" he then sounded like a conservative - tinged populist by encouraging personal responsibility to help each other			2
" we have to be willing to play outside the red and blue boxes that the media pundits put us in , " he said to applause			0
" we have to be willing to reach out to others who look or speak differently than us ; we have to be willing to personally reach out a helping hand to a neighbor or a friend suffering from drug addiction , depression or the dignity stripping loss of a job			0
" continuing the theme , @entity2 outlined policy directions on education and drug enforcement that straddled the ideological spectrum			2
" we will make it our priority to have every child in @entity10 have a chance to get a good education , " he said , again prompting applause and cheers by adding that " no matter what adult we have to offend , no matter where you came from , no matter what sacred cow we must slay , no matter how much we have to change the conventional thinking , we will no longer stand for the achievement gap which exists between our best and least educated children			2
" then he became more liberal , saying " we will end the failed war on drugs that believes that incarceration is the cure of every ill caused by drug abuse			0
" " we will make drug treatment available to as many of our non-violent offenders as we can , " @entity2 said , " and we will partner with our citizens to create a society that understands this simple truth : every life has value and no life is disposable			2
" is this what ' jersey - style ' means ? @entity1 's @entity412 , @entity413 , @entity414 and @entity415 contributed to this report .			0
