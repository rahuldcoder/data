-- way before people such as @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 broke ground for women in comedy , there was @entity10			1
she got started in the late ' 50s , a time when female stand - up comics were a rarity			1
at this time , the concept of a woman 's place was truly that it was in the home ; women were n't supposed to be funny			1
and as much as they say nowadays that comedy and show business is a boys ' club , it does n't compare with the way it used to be			2
@entity10 found her way in			1
today , some women may condemn other women for doing self - deprecating comedy , but @entity10 did it and she took it to an art form and it was n't threatening , it was n't angry and , just in a nutshell , when all else failed , it was just plain funny			1
@entity10 dies ' with a smile on her face ' people have many theories about comedy , but being just plain funny is the one most important thing			1
you could not call @entity10 just a funny stand - up comic			1
she was a gifted performer -- an actress equally adept at comedy and drama			2
after her first big appearances on " the @entity46 " brought her national fame , she had a successful career in movies , as a stage actress , at comedy clubs , on tv and on comedy albums			1
when i was a child , tv was packed with variety shows , and she seemed to always be on the air			0
she was the ultimate downtrodden , frustrated housewife			0
she portrayed it to a freakish degree			0
i remember her coming on to the screen with what looked like a fright wig			0
her hair looked like she had just stuck her finger in an electric socket			0
her dresses would be inappropriately short , and she would be holding her ever - ready , impossibly long cigarette holder			1
she appeared to be someone who would be a hero in the gay community , which she was			0
but @entity10 was a hero for everyone			1
her jokes were always self - effacing and hysterically funny			1
here 's one : " you know you 're getting old when your blood type 's been discontinued			0
" here 's another : " i love to go to the doctor			0
where else would a man look at me and say , ' take off your clothes ? ' " she used to talk about having a husband named " @entity84			0
" no one ever saw this " @entity84 " fellow , but to the tv public , he was mythical			0
we did n't know him , but we all knew him			2
he was stupid , frustrating and incompetent			0
we all had a very clear picture of him in our minds			0
she was much smarter than he was			0
because @entity10 was clearly smart			1
she did @entity95 tours through @entity96 with @entity97 , and it is a testament to her skill that she could hold her own against a comedian like @entity97			1
but that 's what a trouper does			0
she was born in 1917 and had an incredibly long career , recently doing voice - over work on shows such as " @entity107			2
" i had the honor and privilege of appearing three times with @entity10			1
we were both guest judges on " @entity113 , " and we appeared together on " @entity114			0
" we also were both in the documentary " @entity117 , " the film about the dirtiest joke ever told , proving @entity10 was no prude			1
in the documentary , after they show me performing the joke , they cut to a reaction of @entity10 fainting			2
when i worked with her in recent years , i 'll say she looked roughly 1,000 years old , but walked without a cane , was more than totally alert , funny , outspoken and a true pro. she autographed her book for me and gave it to me as a present			1
i was so touched that i did n't even consider selling it on @entity129			2
recently there were reports of @entity10 ' declining health			2
i think she stopped working at that point , or worked less , at least			0
i do n't know if her failing health killed her , or just not being able to perform like she used to			0
in any case , whenever you watch comedians , male or female , they owe a great debt to @entity10			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			2

@entity144 : @entity10 did stand - up when women were n't supposed to be funny
@entity10 was not just a funny comic , he says ; she was a fine actress in movies and on stage
*gofffried* : she did @entity95 tours through @entity96 with @entity97 , holding her own
in her old age , she was totally alert , funny , outspoken and a true pro to the end , he says
