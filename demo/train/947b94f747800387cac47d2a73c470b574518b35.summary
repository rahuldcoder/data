sen. @entity0 has spent quite a bit of time reaching out to liberals over the past year , and that list apparently now includes @entity5			1
@entity0 , a libertarian - leaning @entity6 from @entity7 , and @entity5 , a comedian who shares some of @entity0 's libertarian views , had drinks two weeks ago , @entity5 told the liberal news outlet @entity12			1
the two met not long after @entity5 said on his @entity14 show that @entity0 is " interesting " and could " possibly " get his vote			2
if the 2016 presidential race came down to @entity0 and @entity17 , @entity5 said he might consider backing @entity0			1
@entity18 , @entity5 in heated debate about @entity20 @entity5 said he was most attracted to @entity0 because of the senator 's general views on foreign policy , though he 's not a fan of his recent support for bombing @entity26			1
" he 's great on ending the empire , not getting into any more foreign entanglements -- i 'm even to the left of him on the bombing ( of @entity26 ) ; he wants to keep bombing @entity26 , i want us to stop bombing altogether , " he said			0
while @entity5 donated $ 1 million to a super pac backing president @entity37 in 2012 , he has been less than enthusiastic about a potential @entity39 presidency , especially when it comes to her foreign policy			2
@entity0 's campus challenge but @entity5 told @entity12 there 's stark daylight between him and @entity0 on a different issue			1
" i had drinks with him about two weeks ago			0
he 's a nice guy , he 's a smart guy			0
my big problem is i asked him about the environment , which is my big issue , " @entity5 said			0
" he had made a comment that was very similar to what @entity53 said about a month or two ago , which was basically , ' why are we talking the environment when @entity26 is out there ? ' i said , ' senator , y'know , you sounded just like @entity53			0
' " last month , @entity0 blasted @entity39 for saying climate change marked the " most consequential , urgent , sweeping collection of challenges we face			2
" " i do n't think we really want a commander in chief who 's battling climate change instead of terrorism , " @entity0 said on @entity64			1
@entity5 said that @entity0 's answer on the environment was " wholly unsatisfactory " and that the senator would lose his vote based entirely on that issue unless @entity0 comes up with a better answer			1
" this is the deal - breaker issue with me			0
you 've got to be good on this or , i 'm sorry , not going to happen , " @entity5 said			0
" @entity80 with @entity5 " airs on @entity14 , which , like @entity78 , is a division of @entity79 .			0
