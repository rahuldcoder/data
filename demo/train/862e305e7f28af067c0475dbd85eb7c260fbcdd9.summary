@entity0 , @entity1 -- research teams at the @entity4 have discovered it takes between 100 to 1,000 years for a golf ball to decompose naturally			1
a startling fact when it is also estimated 300 million balls are lost or discarded in the @entity10 alone , every year			2
it seems the simple plastic golf ball is increasingly becoming a major litter problem			1
the scale of the dilemma was underlined recently in @entity16 , where scientists -- who scoured the watery depths in a submarine hoping to discover evidence of the prehistoric @entity21 -- were surprised to find hundreds of thousands of golf balls lining the bed of the loch			1
it is thought tourists and locals have used the loch as an alternative driving range for many years			2
the footage shot by underwater robotics team @entity31 , can be seen below			0
with an increasing number of golf balls discarded each year , the @entity32 devised a number of tests to determine the environmental impact of golf balls on their surroundings			1
it was found that during decomposition , the golf balls dissolved to release a high quantity of heavy metals			1
dangerous levels of zinc were found in the synthetic rubber filling used in solid core golf balls			1
when submerged in water , the zinc attached itself to the ground sediment and poisoned the surrounding flora and fauna			2
course manager for the @entity4 , @entity55 , said the scale of the problem is unknown : " there has been very little research on the environmental impact of golf balls , but it 's safe to say the indicators are not good			1
we are planning to collaborate with environmentalists in @entity10 to conduct more tests to fully explore the extent of the problem			0
" local government ministers in @entity16 have also complained about the level of golf ball littering			2
@entity77 lawmaker @entity76 told @entity2 : " from the moon to the bottom of @entity80 , golf balls are humanity 's signature litter in the most inaccessible locations			1
" and he 's not wrong			0
on february 6 , 1971 , astronaut @entity81 was filmed taking a swing with a six iron on the surface of the moon			0
according to @entity81 , the balls flew off in the distance and landed a few kilometers away			0
although the balls were left for future golfers to discover , it is believed the extreme temperatures on the surface would have dissolved the balls many moons ago			0
in many cases , removing a partially degraded ball from a lake or woodland area could result in further damage to the wildlife			0
so what is the solution ? @entity76 had this advice : " keep your balls on the fairway or invest in a stock of biodegradable balls			0

it takes 100 to 1,000 years for a golf ball to degrade
golf balls are composed of a zinc rubber filling
