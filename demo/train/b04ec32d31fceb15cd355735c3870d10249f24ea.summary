-- alzheimer 's disease is more common among @entity2 but the genetic contributors to the disorder have n't been identified until now			2
in the largest study of genetic risk factors for @entity9 's in the @entity2 population , researchers reporting in the @entity6 found that two genes associated with higher risk of the neurodegenerative disorder among whites also contributed to higher rates of the disease among @entity2			1
changes in these genes , however , conferred a higher risk of disease among @entity2 than among whites			0
in the study involving nearly 6,000 @entity2 participants aged 60 or older , about 2,000 of whom had @entity9 's and 4,000 who did not , variants in the genes @entity24 and @entity25 increased risk of developing @entity9 's by 80 % and more than two fold , respectively			1
by comparison , @entity24 is likely responsible for a 10 % to 20 % increased risk for the memory - robbing disorder within white populations , and about 40 % of whites with certain forms of @entity25 are diagnosed with @entity9 's			2
@entity0 : two studies find promising new ways to detect @entity9 's earlier @entity40 € ²s role in the @entity9 does n't come as a complete surprise ; it is involved in producing cholesterol and lipids , and some research suggests that @entity9 's disease may involve aberrations in fat metabolism that are similar to those behind heart disease			1
the more prominent contribution that @entity24 seems to play in @entity9 's risk among @entity2 , however , does suggest that such lipid - based pathways may be more important in this population than among whites			1
@entity24 also regulates transport of proteins , including those responsible for the production of amyloid , a hallmark of @entity9 's when it builds up in sticky plaques in the brain			0
@entity0 : study shows @entity9 's protein may not spread like a virus more studies are needed to confirm the role that these genetic variants play in contributing to @entity9 's in the @entity2 population , but if the associations are confirmed , they could lead to more refined ways of diagnosing and treating the disease in this group			1
focusing on lowering cholesterol production or regulating lipid movement into the brain might be more effective , for example , than among whites , whose disease might rely on a different molecular pathway			0
and even if these interventions do n't prevent the disease , they may help in slowing the onset of symptoms			0

2 genes associated with @entity9 's in whites were also linked to higher rates in @entity2
study involved nearly 6,000 @entity2 participants aged 60 or older
more studies are needed to confirm the role that these genetic variants play
