@entity0 , @entity1 -- baptist televangelist @entity3 said sunday he will fight allegations that he coerced young male church members into having sex with him			1
" i am not the man that has been portrayed on television , " he told his congregation			2
speaking publicly about the accusations for the first time , @entity3 did not address the specific allegations contained in four lawsuits filed against him earlier this week			1
" i 've been accused , i 'm under attack , " he said , lowering his head and softening his voice behind the pulpit at the @entity18 in suburban @entity19			1
" i want you to know , as i said earlier , that i am not a perfect man			2

" with that , the 57 - year - old pastor put down his microphone and walked off stage , receiving deafening applause from the thousands who had come to hear him			1
the lawsuits accuse @entity3 of using his power and influence within the 25,000 - member church to lure young male church members into sexual relationships			1

@entity89 , 21 , who has attended @entity90 for nearly eight years , told @entity2 that after hearing @entity3 's sermon , " nothing has changed			1
" " my love for the ministry , my love for [ the ] bishop and his family has not changed , " she said			0
@entity89 also said she was " proud " of @entity3 for " the way he came out with his head up			1
... he showed the strength that i 'm accustomed to			2
" on saturday , @entity90 members also voiced support			2
" i stand behind the bishop because of the leader that he is			0
he is a true leader			0
the word that he gives is so rich , it is so life - changing , " church member @entity109 told @entity2			0
a former @entity90 employee , @entity112 , said he hopes the allegations are not true			2
" the evidence ... all of that is very troubling to many of us in the gospel community , the @entity121 community , " said @entity112			0
@entity3 gave 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. sermons on sunday			1
they were essentially the same			0
eliciting chuckles from the audience , @entity3 began both by joking , " i got ta talk to my family " of worshippers before addressing what other " folk " -- meaning media -- were there to hear			1
both sermons focused on " understanding painful situations			0
" he quoted @entity133 : " when you pass through the waters , i will be with you ; and through the rivers , they shall not overwhelm you ; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned , and the flame shall not consume you			0
" @entity3 encouraged congregants to think about natural disasters -- tornadoes and floods			1
he specifically named @entity144 and other " painful situations			0
" " bishop @entity3 will have painful situations , " he said			1
shouts of affirmation came from the audience			0
" we will walk through this painful situation , " he continued			0
then , the bishop quoted the 23rd @entity152			0
" @entity153 , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... " worshippers were on their feet			0
he urged them to stay committed to being " prayerful , " then briefly reminded them that it 's nearly election time in @entity1 , that it was important to vote and be involved			2
he then went back to speaking about himself			0
" some people think i 'm lost , " he said			2
it is those people , he said , who " will have an opportunity to come down to the altar			0
" @entity90 will continue to worship and thrive , he said			0
" we ai n't gon na stop it , " he said			0
the camera panned to the pastor 's wife @entity170			2
each sermon ran approximately 20 minutes			0
between sermons , @entity3 spoke briefly to reporters			1
" i want this to be dealt in the court of justice and not by public opinion , " he said			0
