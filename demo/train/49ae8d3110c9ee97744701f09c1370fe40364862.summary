@entity0 -- the @entity2 announced wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans			1
e-cigarettes are battery - operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals			1
known as " e-cigarettes , " the devices are battery - operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals , spiced with flavors such as chocolate , cola or bubble gum			1
while manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a " healthy way " to smoke , federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine , which is highly addictive , and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user			1
" the @entity2 is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public , " said dr. @entity29 , commissioner of the @entity2			2
@entity1 contacted @entity35 - based @entity34 , one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes , after the @entity2 announcement , and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment			1
because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the @entity2 for evaluation or approval , the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user			1
that is why the @entity2 began to test them			0
the @entity2 's @entity57 analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes			1
in releasing its information , the @entity2 did not identify the two companies , but said in one sample , diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected			1
other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them , the @entity2 said			2
the @entity2 has been examining and seizing shipments of non- @entity76 - made e-cigarettes at the @entity76 border since summer 2008			2
to date , 50 shipments have been stopped			0
the products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug - device product under the @entity82			0
" we know very little about these devices , said dr. @entity85 , director of the @entity86 at the @entity87 , " but to say they are healthy -- that 's highly doubtful			0
" @entity85 and other health experts attended the @entity2 announcement on its findings			0
dr. @entity93 , chairman of the @entity94 , said parents need to be aware of e-cigarettes			0
" it is very important that parents let their children know these are not safe and to make recommendations , or even enforce rules that they not be used , " he said			0
" children who use these products may also be using other tobacco products , " said dr. @entity102 , director of the @entity103 , @entity104			0
" it 's a good idea to make sure the child is aware of the dangers of tobacco in products in general			0
" the @entity2 has been challenged regarding its jurisdiction over certain e-cigarettes in a case pending in federal court			2
the @entity2 suggested health care professionals and consumers report serious side effects or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the @entity2 's @entity123 either online , by regular mail , fax or phone			1
