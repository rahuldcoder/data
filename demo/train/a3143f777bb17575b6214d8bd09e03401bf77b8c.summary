" @entity23 : a wristband that tells you when to get out of the sun just how common is sunburning your eyes ? according to dr. @entity29 , senior vice president of @entity30 and practicing dermatologist at @entity32 in @entity33 , sunburns to the extent of @entity0 's does n't happen too often , but it is possible if you 're not wearing the right protection			1
" we have sunscreen we can put on our skin , but we do n't have eye drops that offer a protective film for the cornea , so it is really important that everyone , and especially people with fair or light eyes , wear sunglasses that protect against both @entity48 and uvb rays , " says @entity29			1
according to @entity29 , the outer eyeball layer , known as the cornea , is similar to the outer layer of skin			0
when it is burned by the sun 's rays , the cornea becomes inflamed -- an effect called keratitis -- which can be quite painful and , as in @entity0 's case , can cause temporary blindness			1
for someone like @entity0 , who has light irises , there is a higher risk of burns			2
and like sunburns on the skin , burning your cornea causes cumulative damage			2
" in the short run you heal , but in the long run sometimes the damage builds			2
we can get a sunburn , and we can heal from it , and the inflammation can go away , but it can add to the chronic damage and put us at risk for skin cancer , " says @entity29			2
eye issues like cataracts , skin cancer of the eyelids and melanoma in the retina are all possible risks from sun - damaged eyes			1
@entity23 : sunburn and indoor tanning still putting young people at risk for skin cancer thankfully , with numbing and antibiotic eye - drops , it only takes a couple days to recover			0
" the good news is that our bodies are very regenerative , and we have regenerative powers in both the top layer of our skin , and on top of the cornea			0
we are always replacing the skin and corneal cells , " says @entity29			0
" it takes time , but within a few days you can be better			0
" even during the winter , you should protect your eyes from dangerous rays -- particularly when they are reflected off bright surfaces such as snow			1
to keep your eyes safe , wear sunglasses and a hat with a three inch brim , advises @entity29			0
if you do get a burn , see your ophthalmologist right away			0
