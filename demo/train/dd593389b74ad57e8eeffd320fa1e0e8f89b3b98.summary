@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is planning a nuclear test in the area where it has staged previous atomic blasts , according to a report from @entity1 intelligence officials obtained by @entity2			1
the intelligence report has come to light as @entity3 gets ready to carry out a rocket launch this week , a move that would further strain ties between the reclusive , nuclear - armed state and other countries			1
the launch is scheduled to take place just months after the ascendancy of its new leader			0
the @entity1 intelligence report says it is probable that after the long - range rocket launch , @entity3 will use the ensuing international condemnation as an excuse to go ahead with the nuclear test in @entity27 , the site in the country 's northeast where the other two tests were conducted in 2006 and 2009			1
the report , which said such a test would be considered a grave provocation , includes satellite images that it says were shot recently and show the final stages of a tunnel being dug at the site			2
the photos show an unusual pile of earth and sand near the opening of the tunnel , and the report says this pile has been growing in size since march			0
@entity3 state media outlets have not made an announcement regarding any plans for a new nuclear test			1
on monday , @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said the rocket launch would further isolate the country			1
" we view the potential rocket launch as a very provocative act that would be , if it were conducted , done in direct violation of @entity3 's international obligations , " he told reporters			1
" any further underground testing would be a provocative action ... in each case , this would be an indication of @entity3 's decision , at the leadership level , not to take the steps that are necessary to allow @entity3 to end its isolation , to rejoin the community of nations and to do something about the extreme poverty and deprivation that its people suffer from because of the nature of the system they live under and the isolation that they have brought on themselves			1
" he added , " i do n't have any specific communications involving the president to report out to you today , but we are very focused on this			2
" such an act by @entity87 " would make it virtually impossible for the @entity83 to provide the nutritional assistance that we had planned to provide			1
" a university official sees @entity3 's latest moves as calculating			1
" once again this shows ... they know how to manipulate the world , " said @entity90 of @entity0 's @entity91			1
" if they do a missile launch and in a few months a successful nuclear test , especially a uranium - based nuclear device , it will send a very strong message to the world			1
the same message they always want to deliver : we are here , we are dangerous , unpredictable and it 's better to deal with us by giving us monetary and food concessions			0
" in private meetings brokered in part by @entity109 , @entity3 in february agreed to stop nuclear tests , uranium enrichment and long - range missile launches in exchange for resumption of @entity83 food aid			1
a launch and a test , if carried out , could also derail recent efforts to reconvene the multilateral talks , known as six - party talks , on denuclearizing @entity3			1
" we believe , in particular , that @entity109 joins us in its interest in seeing a denuclearized @entity126 , and we are continuing to encourage @entity109 , in particular , to act more effectively in that interest , " @entity122 spokeswoman @entity121 told reporters in @entity124			0
@entity87 agreed to curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for aid in an agreement reached in talks in september 2005			0
the deal fell apart after @entity3 conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and later disclosed a previously unknown uranium enrichment program that provided a second path to a bomb , in addition to the already known plutonium program			2
the country has designated 2012 as a year of strength and prosperity to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity145 , the founder of the communist state			0
his birthday next sunday , known as the " @entity149 , " is a key public holiday on the @entity3 calendar			2
last month , @entity87 announced it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite sometime between this thursday and the following monday to mark the occasion			2
the @entity3 government says the operation is for peaceful purposes			2
but @entity158 , the @entity83 and @entity1 see the launch as a cover for a long - range ballistic missile test			1
the @entity1 intelligence report noted that shortly before the last two nuclear tests , @entity3 launched what it said were satellites into orbit			1
the act of firing the long - range rocket would breach @entity170 resolutions			0
@entity158 has said it will shoot down any part of the rocket that enters its territory			0
the planned launch is scheduled to take place less than four months after @entity176 became " supreme leader " of @entity3 , succeeding his father , @entity177 , who died in december			1
analysts are trying to gauge how much influence the younger kim , thought to be in his late 20s , wields			0
senior officials in the regime , including @entity181 's uncle , @entity186 , are considered to exert considerable sway on policy			0
@entity3 granted a rare glimpse sunday of its preparations for the rocket launch , taking a group of journalists to the @entity194 in @entity194 , in the northwest part of the country			1
" if you look for yourselves with your own eyes , then you can judge whether it 's a ballistic missile , or whether it 's a launch vehicle to put a satellite into orbit , " @entity197 , head of the launch site , said through a translator			2
" that 's why we 've invited you to this launch site			2
" journalists -- who were not allowed to take laptops or cell phones to the site , but were permitted to shoot video -- were shown the control center and the satellite that officials said would be shot into space			0
the rocket itself is 30 meters , or about 100 feet , long			0
it was white , with red and blue paint			0
international leaders have urged @entity3 to cancel the launch , but @entity87 has refused to back down , insisting that it needs the satellite to gather information on its crops , forests and weather			2
an independent @entity231 analyst who visited the launch site said he saw nothing obvious that raised red flags			0
" i do n't know what they want to do in the future , but today what we see is a space launcher , " @entity235 said			0
@entity242 , the former @entity83 ambassador to the @entity243 , said @entity176 may be trying to consolidate his leadership by sending a message to two audiences -- to the international community , he may be trying to establish himself as in charge			1
but his most important audience is the @entity3 military and party leaders , he told @entity2			2
" he 's trying to show them that he is not going to buckle down from the @entity83 or the six - party talks or @entity109 ; that they 're going to proceed with this launch ; that they 're going to proceed with him taking over the leadership of the country			1
" @entity242 urged the @entity83 not to react in haste			2
" let 's see what eventually happens , " he said			0
" this is how the @entity3 operate : they try to send these huge , scary messages by these actions			0
" the last time @entity87 carried out what it described as a satellite launch , in april 2009 , the @entity170 condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated			0
@entity109 , @entity3 's closest ally and largest provider of aid , has expressed concern about the planned launch			1
@entity273 says it has held talks with @entity87 on the matter , but they appear to have had little effect on the @entity3 's plans			1
" @entity109 strongly encourages everyone involved to remain calm and reasonable , " said the @entity109 foreign minister , @entity279 , according to a report issued monday by the official @entity109 news agency , @entity281			0
" these issues need to be worked out in a diplomatic and peaceful manner			0
" analysts say the planned trajectory of the multistaged rocket 's path is north to south over the @entity289 , with the main body of the projectile eventually landing in the @entity292 near the @entity293			1
president @entity294 of the @entity293 has condemned any such launch as a " needless provocation " that could increase tensions in @entity298			0
@entity2 's @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report .			0
