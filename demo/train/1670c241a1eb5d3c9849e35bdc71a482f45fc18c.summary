-- former @entity3 lineman @entity2 's transformation from an affable prankster , quick to flash a wry smile , to a person who was often frightened -- and frightening -- was subtle at first			1
it began in 2006 , with a bad dream			2
" he woke up in the middle of the night and started screaming and told everyone to run out of the house , " said @entity9 , @entity2 's wife			1
" he thought that someone was blowing up our house			2
" @entity9 tried to dismiss the incident as isolated , except that two weeks later , there was another outburst , then another , until they were an almost - nightly occurrence			2
and as @entity2 's fear and paranoia began overwhelming him , so did episodes of confusion and rage that sometimes turned violent			1
only three years after retiring from the @entity3 in 2006 , @entity2 was suffering			1
the tragic culmination of his pain came when he committed suicide in 2009 at 38			1
scientists at the @entity33 for the @entity34 tested @entity2 's brain tissue and confirmed that before he died he was suffering with a brain disease -- chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- that seems to afflict football players			1
" there is evidence of @entity44 in his brain making him yet another former @entity3 player who had definite @entity44 , " said @entity40 , co-director of the traumatic encephalopathy center			1
@entity40 said the center has found evidence of @entity44 in the brains of 13 of 14 former @entity3 players , including @entity2			1
usually found in much older dementia patients , @entity44 is an accumulation of an abnormal protein in the brain called tau , which is associated with repeated head traumas -- concussions or subconcussive hits -- that are not allowed to heal			2
@entity44 can also diminish brain tissue and is associated with memory loss , depression , impulsive behavior and rage			2
outrage comes out of nowhere the @entity67 ' daughter recalled an incident at a local burger joint : " he was ordering , and he got mad at ( an employee ) and just punched him in the face , " said 16 - year - old @entity73			2
" he thought the guy was shaking the ice weird or something , and he took him down in the restaurant , " added @entity9			0
it was all uncharacteristic for a man whom @entity9 described as " someone who would light up the room , " outgoing , affable , funny			0
it was incongruous behavior for a father who had been involved and close with his two daughters -- taking them four - wheeling , volunteering at school , even painting their fingernails			0
" he was just the best dad in the world , " said @entity73			0
researchers believe that the battering @entity2 took as an @entity3 lineman -- and the hits he accumulated over two decades of playing -- might explain his brain 's deterioration			1
" what we know is that by definition , a lineman will have their head hit almost every play of every game and every practice , " said dr. @entity100 , co-director of the @entity101			2
" the estimates are around 1,000 or more hits for a lineman every season			2
" it might have been the accumulation of tens of thousands of subconcussive hits -- which might not result in overt concussion symptoms such as dizziness , short - term memory loss and confusion but could still cause brain damage -- that finally took a toll on @entity2			1
" i think the issue is that the brain was not meant to be hit even subconcussively 1,000 times a year , " said @entity100			2
the @entity3 would not comment about @entity2 's case specifically , but it emphasized that the league supports the @entity101 center 's work and that it continues to take steps limit contact to the head and to ensure that concussions , when they occur , are properly treated			1
10 hard seasons of hard hits @entity2 played for 10 seasons , first with the @entity138 and then the @entity139			1
he played defense on the 1998 @entity139 team that had a storybook @entity143 run			0
@entity9 said her husband never let a concussion deter him			2
" @entity2 did n't come out of games because he always said @entity3 players are so expendable , " said @entity9			1
" and if you 're not out there , the next guy will be			0
" @entity152 : playing with concussion " part of the game " @entity2 played through dizzying hits			1
" there were times when he 'd be slow getting up and kind of try to shake it off and get back in there , " said @entity9			0
" he would have headaches and he would say ' i wish someone would split my head open with an ax and relieve the pressure , ' but it was n't even an option to come out ( of the game )			0
" could a tumor explain his behavior ? when @entity2 was found to have a brain tumor in 2007 , at the height of his unorthodox behavior , it was actually a glimmer of hope for his wife			1
" i was almost relieved because i was thinking , ' ok , here is the answer to why he 's acting like this , because he had a tumor , ' " said @entity9			2
" and then after he recovered from the tumor being removed , he was back to the same symptoms of paranoia			0
" @entity2 's neurosurgeon said that he most likely had the tumor all his life and that the benign growth could not explain his behavior , @entity9 said			1
researchers at @entity101 call the brain tumor potentially confounding , but most likely not a factor in @entity2 's behavior			1
" there 's no way we would ever know what was specifically caused by the tumor or the surgery for the tumor or @entity44 , " said @entity100			2
" but more than likely at least some of his behavior and symptoms were associated with the worsening of the cte			0
" the reasons for @entity2 's behavioral changes soon became secondary to a bubbling fear for his wife and daughters			1
it came to a head during a ski trip that @entity9 took with her daughter @entity73 in january of 2009			0
" he called us 100 times a day , wondering where we were and we 'd tell him we 're in @entity217 ... and he just did n't believe it , " said @entity9			0
" he thought people were driving around the house and he was wondering who had been following him that day			0
it was just very scary			0
" @entity2 was supposed to pick up his family at the airport but never showed up			1
the next morning , @entity9 encountered her husband in the hallway of their home , brandishing a gun			0
" i saw the gun , and i ran out the front door , " said @entity9			0
" he had gone into the kitchen , and as soon as i put my hand on the front door , i heard it			0
" what @entity9 had heard was the firing of the gun that killed @entity2 when he turned the gun on himself			1
in a moment , months of consternation and abject fear ended , giving way to profound sadness for a family that , even as they waded through the mire of @entity2 's condition , could not have foreseen this end			1
" he was always so full of life , " said @entity9			0
" even his darkest moments , i just still never imagined that he would do that			0
" two years removed from the terrible events of that january morning , @entity9 finds some solace knowing that a brain disease that could explain why she and her daughters lost @entity2			1
" i had nowhere to turn			0
i did n't know anything about ( @entity44 )			0
i did n't know other players were going through this type of stuff , " said @entity9			0
" i think if @entity2 knew at the time how serious ( playing through concussion ) could be down the road , he would have backed off			1
" @entity9 is heartened by rules changes and progress at the @entity3 level , but chafes when she hears about players who oppose those changes			0
" i know a lot of the players are against that , but they 're young and they have n't seen what i 've seen , " said @entity9			0
@entity9 says that if she could speak directly to players , " i would tell them what i went through , what @entity2 went through and what other people i know have gone through and then let them make that decision			1
because i feel like they 're making their statements without being educated			0
