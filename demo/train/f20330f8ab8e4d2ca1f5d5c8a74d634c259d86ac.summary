-- the first @entity2 agents landed in @entity3 on september 26 , 2001 , beginning direct @entity5 efforts to overthrow the @entity6			1
ten years later , the @entity5 is still fighting the @entity6 , and the recent assassination of @entity8 , leader of @entity3 's @entity9 , shows that we are far from total victory			1
the terrorist training camps are gone and @entity14 's top leaders are dead or on the run			0
nonetheless , @entity3 remains riddled with violence , corruption and hatred			0
the citizens of @entity3 continue to suffer from crushing poverty , immobility and intimidation			0
president @entity23 in june made it clear that the @entity5 would not continue to fight indefinitely in @entity3			1
the president announced that he would withdraw about one - third of the roughly 100,000 @entity5 soldiers in @entity3 by summer 2012			1
he also pledged a fuller disengagement by 2014 , when " the @entity3 people will be responsible for their own security			0
" subsequent discussions revealed that the @entity30 expected to keep no more than 25,000 soldiers in @entity3 , about half the @entity5 deployment in @entity33			1
after 10 long years , @entity5 withdrawal from @entity3 is wise and necessary			1
an open - ended commitment is unsustainable in the face of global recession , excessive @entity5 government debt and pressing political challenges in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 -- just to name a few crucial countries			0
the @entity5 must disengage from @entity3 and focus its resources elsewhere			1
the real question is how the @entity5 should withdraw and what it should leave behind			2
how can we make sure the sacrifices of the last 10 years are not betrayed after we leave ? how can we help ensure against a reversion to the conditions in @entity3 that allowed the 9/11 terrorists to train and take refuge ? the @entity5 has extensive experience with these questions , from our difficult interventions over the last century			1
in the @entity64 , @entity33 , @entity61 , and to a certain extent , @entity63 , @entity5 investments in nationwide elections , in a multiparty legislature and in a respected judiciary have brought some legitimacy to the government			0
this is a very mixed history with few " victories , " but some insights that might help with our withdrawal from @entity3			0
@entity5 leaders have a tendency to invest heavily in friendly strongmen , like @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 in @entity40 and @entity80 in @entity3			1
these figures initially look reliable and morally attractive as courageous leaders of anti-communist and anti-taliban efforts			0
extensive @entity5 support , however , becomes corrupting , increasing the isolation and dictatorial qualities of @entity90 's chosen allies			0
in the end , dependence on strongmen discredits @entity5 power			1
as @entity5 soldiers leave @entity3 , they must not " hand over " power to @entity80 or any similar figure			1
instead , the @entity5 must work hard in the next year to build deeper ties with diverse local leaders , many of whom oppose both the @entity6 and @entity80 at the same time			1
the @entity5 should encourage power - sharing between groups , and it should avoid dependence on @entity80 for security after 2012			1
@entity3 needs more federalism across regions and less centralization in @entity108			0
@entity5 's long history of foreign interventions proves that local insurgents can outlast our soldiers			0
as in @entity3 , the @entity5 will eventually bring its troops home , but the insurgents have nowhere to go			1
they can stay under cover , re-group and re-emerge after the @entity5 leave			2
that is precisely the dynamic with the resurgence of the @entity6 in @entity3			0
if @entity5 soldiers can not outlast the insurgents , @entity5 - supported institutions can			2
in the @entity64 , @entity33 , @entity61 , and to a certain extent , @entity63 , where @entity5 investments in nationwide elections , in a multiparty legislature and in a respected judiciary have brought some legitimacy to the @entity63 government			0
it is the joint businesses , the public works and especially the schools that changed society in the most enduring and beneficial ways			1
these institutions are also the most likely to draw local participation and popular endorsement			0
money devoted to infrastructure and schools is well spent , especially as foreign military forces are reduced			0
@entity5 efforts in @entity3 are threatened most by the extremism and violence in @entity145			1
although an official ally of the @entity5 , @entity145 has provided sanctuary for terrorists , including @entity149 , and the leaders of the @entity6			1
@entity145 has contributed to the corruption and intimidation in @entity3 that oppress citizens seeking a better way of life			1
the @entity5 must put more pressure on @entity145 to play a productive role in the region			2
we must insist that the billions of dollars we send to @entity160 are not diverted to meddling in @entity3			2
instead , the @entity145 military and intelligence agencies must work to apprehend terrorists , especially on their own soil , and they must enforce a cessation of violence on the key trade and communications routes into and out of @entity3			2
we can not ask the @entity145 to abandon their sympathies for some extreme @entity171 parties , including elements of the @entity6 , but we can insist that they help to maintain order , stability , and openness in the region			2
although @entity5 must withdraw from @entity3 , they must do so in a way that supports positive changes			2
we must give @entity3 the chance to run a functioning nation - state of their own			0
for all the difficulties of the last 10 years , there are real achievements -- including the establishment of political stability in the @entity187 provinces and the reduction in country - wide poverty -- to build on			2
progress in withdrawal is possible and it will not cost very much			0
it will certainly come at less expense than a reversion of @entity3 to the terrorist haven it was in september 2001			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 : when we leave @entity3 , 10 years of progress could be lost
@entity204 : we must not hand over power to a strongman , like @entity80 , which discredits @entity5
we must insist @entity145 fights extremism within its borders and without , @entity204 writes
we must invest in institutions , public works , he says , and especially schools
