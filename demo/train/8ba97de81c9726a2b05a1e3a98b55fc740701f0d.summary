a new video shows what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of @entity3 in years			1
and the @entity4 and the @entity5 either did n't know about it or could n't get a drone there in time to strike			0
@entity10 officials wo n't comment on that , but every frame of the video is now being analyzed by the @entity10			1
in the middle of the clip , the man known as @entity3 's crown prince , @entity15 , appears brazenly out in the open , greeting followers in @entity19			1
@entity20 , the no. 2 leader of @entity3 globally and the head of @entity22 , has said he wants to attack the @entity10			1
but in the video , he looks unconcerned that he could be hit by an @entity10 drone			1
the video started appearing on jihadist websites recently , drawing the attention of @entity10 officials and global terrorism experts			1
@entity10 officials say they believe it 's authentic			1
" this is quite an extraordinary video , " @entity31 , @entity32 terrorism analyst , said			0
the video shows @entity15 addressing more than 100 fighters somewhere within @entity19 , @entity31 said , a restive nation on the southwestern portion of the @entity38			1
the @entity3 leader , he said , is " taking a big risk in doing this			2
" but he does n't mince words about his mission			0
in a speech to the group , @entity15 makes it clear that he 's going after the @entity10 , saying " we must eliminate the cross			1
... the bearer of the cross is @entity10 ! " @entity10 officials believe the highly produced video is recent			1
with some fighters faces blurred , there is worry it signals a new round of plotting			0
" the @entity10 intelligence community should be surprised that such a large group of @entity3 assembled together , including the leadership , and somehow they did n't notice , " said @entity57 , @entity32 national security analyst			1
there is good reason to worry			0
@entity22 , also known as @entity22 , is considered the most dangerous @entity3 affiliate			2
the @entity4 and the @entity5 have repeatedly killed @entity22 leaders with drone strikes			0
but the group is now emboldened			0
" the main problem about this group is that it has a bomb maker who can put bombs on to planes that ca n't be detected , " @entity57 said			2
that bomb maker , @entity74 , is believed to be responsible for several attack attempts against the @entity10 , including the failed 2009 christmas day underwear bomber attack in @entity77			2
@entity78 does n't appear in the video			2
he remains in hiding , and intelligence experts say he and other @entity22 leaders have gone back to using couriers to communicate to avoid detection			0
that makes it even harder to figure out what @entity15 may order next			2
but the terror group leader 's goal is clear , @entity31 said			2
" his message to the @entity10 , " @entity31 said , " was very much the same as ( former @entity3 leader @entity90 ) @entity90 's : ' we 're coming after you			1
' " @entity10 rep. @entity94 , chairman of the @entity95 , told " @entity100 with @entity101 " that leaks tied to @entity19 have affected @entity10 intelligence collection , but he said he could n't say whether @entity10 intelligence knew about the meeting			1
chairman : @entity3 ' more diverse and more aggressive ' than pre- 9/11 asked by @entity101 whether the @entity10 would have sent a drone if officials had known such a large meeting of terrorists was taking place out in the open , the @entity104 @entity103 said it 's unclear			1
" it really depends , " he said			0
" there are a lot of procedures that one would go through ... to do an airstrike on any large package of individuals			0
" seeing such a group of @entity3 operatives assembled is n't a surprise , he said			1
" i think they have these meetings more often than people realize , " @entity94 said			0
" it 's difficult to get assets in position			0
you have to know where they are and where they meet at the right time in the right place with the right equipment			0
that 's a lot to do			0
" the video , @entity94 says , is another sign that @entity3 remains a dangerous threat			1
" we think that they 're feeling empowered			0
the less pressure you put on them , the more they take that as a victory , the more that they believe that they can get away with plotting , planning , organizing as you saw there ( in the video ) , finance , training , " he said			0
" all of the things that they would need to do to strike a @entity156 target , they 're going through that process			0
" retired gen. @entity158 said smaller @entity3 affiliates are coalescing into a more organized base			1
" sooner or later , if they continue to get better , stronger and more organized , " he said , " they will be a direct threat to the @entity10			2
" it 's unlikely the @entity10 was n't aware of the meeting shown in the video , @entity158 told " @entity167			1
" " the question is n't why did n't we know , " he said			0
" the question is : what are we going to do about it ? " @entity22 leader urges militants to find out who killed his @entity177 representative @entity177 : top training ground for @entity3 , @entity179 is told			2

retired @entity10 general : " the question is , what are we going to do about it ? "
@entity10 officials wo n't say whether they knew about the large @entity3 meeting
a new video of the meeting shows the group 's second in command
