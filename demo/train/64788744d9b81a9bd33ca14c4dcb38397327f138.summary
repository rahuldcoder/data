@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and his wife were friends with their next - door neighbors , @entity7 and @entity8			1
they enjoyed life in their quiet , idyllic neighborhood east of @entity12			0
tuesday , crime scene tape separating their homes showed that not all was well and peaceful			0
deputies and other investigators continued their search for evidence at the home of @entity21 , district attorney for @entity0			1
the prosecutor and his wife were were killed there over the weekend			1
friends discovered their bodies saturday , nearly two months to the day after someone killed @entity8 's chief felony prosecutor , @entity28 , in a daytime shooting outside the county courthouse january 31			1
the @entity31 were at home during the time frame in which their neighbors were slain			1
" i never heard anything , " @entity3 told @entity2 on tuesday			0
his dogs were outside part of the time and never barked , he said			0
a storm passed through early saturday , he said			0
the resident said a neighbor who lives farther away claimed to have heard gunshots			1
@entity3 said he and @entity21 were members of a rifle and pistol club			1
as state and federal investigators flood this north @entity1 county searching for clues in the killing of two prosecutors in two months , the 100,000 people who live here can do little but nervously watch and hope			1
" the residents are , i think , astounded , " said @entity55 , who has lived in @entity0 , the county seat , for 30 years			1
" it 's just , one and one make two			1
you ca n't keep from connecting these			0
and it 's just scary because we have no clue of who did the first shooting			1
and no clue , of course , yet , who did this one			0
and so , of course , our concern is what 's going to happen next			2
" the killings have also rattled law enforcement officials , leading to increased security at the @entity0 courthouse and around the county 's elected leaders			1
" i can promise you that all of the people in this courthouse , all of the elected officials , all of the other people who are involved in this investigation , are being very well - protected , " county judge @entity81 told reporters tuesday			2
@entity1 - sized investigation @entity81 said " literally hundreds " of investigators are working the case			0
" i 'm not sure what time frame we 're on , but i 'm confident that they will find whoever committed this crime , " he said			2
the investigation is starting from scratch , with no leads in the @entity105 ' deaths , @entity2 affiliate @entity100 reported			0
nor do officials have any further ideas on who killed @entity28			0
who 's killing @entity1 prosecutors ? @entity8 talked to relatives on friday night , a search warrant affidavit said			2
investigators have asked a judge for records of mobile phone calls that were relayed through at least one nearby tower , the documents show			0
law enforcement analysts say they believe those behind the attacks had been monitoring and following the two prosecutors , given the locations of the attacks and the brazenness of killing the men where they were most comfortable			0
the killings have put justice officials across the state on high alert , unsure if or when another such strike might occur			0
" this , i think , is a clear concern to individuals who are in public life , particularly those who deal with some very mean and vicious individuals -- whether they 're white supremacy groups or drug cartels that we have , " @entity1 gov. @entity133 said			2
some , like @entity143 's district attorney in @entity144 , are now under 24 - hour security			1
@entity8 himself had a sheriff 's deputy guarding his house after @entity28 's death			2
exactly why the deputy stopped patrolling the home is unclear			0
@entity2 affiliate @entity152 said the sheriff 's department removed the security detail because @entity8 thought it was unnecessary and did n't want to waste taxpayer dollars			2
but sources told @entity100 a deputy was dispatched to @entity8 's home only as a temporary assignment			2
the home was equipped with surveillance cameras , but not the kind that constantly record , the affiliate said			0
theories abound with little solid information , speculation on who is behind the killings has included a white supremacist gang targeted by @entity1 and federal authorities last year , drug cartels and someone with a personal grudge against the slain prosecutors			1
the white supremacist angle gained traction in part because @entity8 , in an interview with the @entity179 before his death , speculated that the @entity182 of @entity1 could have been behind @entity28 's slaying			1
" we put some real dents in the @entity182 around here in the past year , " @entity8 told the news agency			0
prosecutor gunned down outside @entity1 courthouse @entity8 's office was one of numerous @entity1 and federal agencies involved in a multi-year investigation that led to the indictment last year of 34 alleged members of group , including four of its senior leaders , on racketeering charges			1
at the time , assistant u.s. attorney @entity200 called the indictment a " devastating blow " to the organization , which he said used threats and violence -- including murder -- against those who violate its rules or pose a threat to the enterprise			2
the @entity212 describes the group as a " whites only , " prison - based gang operating since at least the 1980s			1
while authorities have not said whether they have linked the deaths of @entity28 and @entity8 , or the involvement of white supremacists , @entity1 law enforcement agencies did warn shortly after the november 2012 indictment that there was " credible information " the group was planning to retaliate			1
@entity225 , a former white supremacist skinhead , said the group could well be behind the killings			1
" the indictment that happened a year ago to this group really hurt the @entity182 of @entity1 , " he told @entity2 's " @entity230 " on tuesday			1
" this is n't an ideology battle here			0
" on the other hand , in the @entity179 interview , @entity8 said @entity28 was n't involved in the @entity182 investigation			0
and a gang expert said killing public officials does n't fit with the group 's profile			1
" this would be a giant leap for them to kill public officials , " said @entity241 , a former @entity1 prison warden and expert on the @entity182			2
he thinks drug cartels concerned about disruptions in the methamphetamine supply are more likely culprits			0
other theories speculation has also extended to whether the shootings have any connection to the march 19 death of @entity257 prisons chief @entity256 , who was gunned down after answering the door at his home			0
while authorities have offered no suggestion the crimes are linked , @entity263 -- the man suspected of killing @entity256 -- was once a member of a white supremacist group and died in a shootout with sheriff 's deputies in northern @entity1 on march 21			1
@entity270 , a friend of the @entity271 and a criminal defense attorney who has worked in the county , said other lawyers and public servants are nervous			1
" having that type of environment going on where people who are just doing their jobs ( and ) getting assassinated -- this is what this is , elected officials getting assassinated -- and that is sending a chill through the ( legal ) community and the community in general , " he said			0
he speculated that the killings were " personal			0
" " if this was a case that somebody was trying to change , they would have been going after witnesses and not the prosecuting attorney , " @entity270 said			2
@entity293 , @entity8 's former law partner , said prosecutors from several counties have exchanged theories about what happened			2
" but frankly , none of us know			0
" " we 're used to hearing this sort of thing happening in @entity302 or even @entity303			0
we 're not used to hearing about judicial officials targeted in the @entity306			0
it 's hard to say whether this is a local phenomenon that involves only one issue locally there , or whether this is the beginning of a trend			2
as a prosecutor , i can just tell you , we ca n't ignore it , " @entity293 said			2
" we 're looking out the peephole when the doorbell rings now , where we maybe we were n't before , " he said			0
filling a void @entity0 government offices will close thursday to allow employees to attend a public memorial service in honor of @entity8 and his wife , @entity81 said			1
a funeral will follow on friday			0
@entity326 , @entity8 's first assistant district attorney , has been named to lead the office on an interim basis			1
she will fill that role until the governor appoints a successor			0
but whoever becomes @entity0 's next top prosecutor will have to grapple with the haunting past			1
" i wonder if the governor is going to find anyone brave enough to take the job of district attorney , " @entity0 city mayor @entity335 told @entity2			1
@entity2 's @entity341 and @entity342 reported from @entity0 ; @entity343 reported and wrote from @entity344			1
@entity2 's @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity347 contributed to this report .			0
