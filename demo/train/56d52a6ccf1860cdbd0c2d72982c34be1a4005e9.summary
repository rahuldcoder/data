with so many developing destinations fighting it out for international tourists , it 's not surprising that some travelers make a point of avoiding the ones with weak human rights and environmental records			1
this can make it challenging to figure out which up - and - coming countries are actually worthy of your tourist coin			0
once again , help comes via nonprofit @entity15 , which this week released its annual list of the countries that are doing the most to promote human rights , preserve their environments and support social welfare -- all while fostering a lively , community - based tourism industry			1
every year , the @entity23 - based organization reviews policies and practices in the developing world to select its top 10			2
" by visiting these countries , we can use our economic leverage to reward good works and support best practices , " says the report			0
in alphabetical order , the 2015 top 10 are : 1			2
@entity45 @entity45 , @entity42 and @entity43 are this year 's new entries to the list			1
seven of this year 's 10 countries are island nations , " indicating a trend in our winners ' circle , " says the report			1
" climate change affects islands dramatically , so they tend to be very aware of the importance of effective environmental policies			2
" as in 2014 , no developing @entity60 country qualified this year			0
" all betrayed too many human rights abuses , and showed too little movement toward sustainability , " says the report			1
choosing the top 10 @entity15 's research focuses on four categories : environmental protection , social welfare , human rights and animal welfare			1
" for each of these categories we look at information past and present so that we understand not only the current state of a country , but how it has changed over time , " says @entity73			0
" this helps us select nations that are actively improving the state of their people , government and environment			0
" information sources include @entity88 , the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity93 resources and the @entity94			0
" after identifying about two dozen ' short list ' performers , we turn to detailed case research , focusing on actions these governments have taken over the year to improve ( or in some cases , weaken ) practices and circumstances in the countries , " says the report			1
the chosen destinations also have to have something to offer tourists			0
each " best ethical destination " offers opportunities to check out incredible natural beauty , enjoy great outdoor activities and have interactions with local people and cultures in a meaningful , mutually enriching way , says @entity15			1
researchers stress that just because these destinations made the list , none scored perfect marks			0
" one issue that plagues nearly every country on our list is a high level of gender - based violence , " says @entity73			0
" @entity37 has the highest rate in @entity128 , and in @entity42 it is so commonplace that most people simply accept it as a way of life			1
" @entity42 , however , does seem to be making headway on this issue			1
in 2013 the legislature passed an amended @entity136 that outlawed spousal rape and improved measures against domestic violence			0
" also , many countries on the list remain in the tier 2 designation of the @entity144 's @entity143 for 2014 , which means their " governments do not fully comply with the @entity148 's ( @entity147 ) minimum standards			2
" " we encourage these countries -- @entity36 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity43 and @entity44 -- to do whatever is necessary to improve conditions , " says the report			2
" we are especially concerned with @entity44 , which is in danger of falling to @entity156 if significant improvements are not seen in 2015			0
" the full report , in @entity160 form , can be found on the @entity15 website .			2
