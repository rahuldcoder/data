@entity16 at @entity17 in @entity18 has provided a designated " pet wing , " home to a variety of animals			1
( @entity8 ) -- as university residence halls seek to transition into more homey environments -- with additions like full kitchens and single - stall bathrooms -- pet ownership is still forbidden for the majority of dorm residents			1
but several universities , including @entity32 , have now added some pets to the " acceptable " list of dorm possessions			1
according to a recent article published by the @entity40 , students at @entity32 who reside in four of the school 's 11 undergraduate dormitories can bring cats with them to school , thanks to a policy implemented several years ago in an effort to curb students from housing forbidden animals			1
other schools have jumped on the four - footed bandwagon : @entity51 , a women 's college in @entity52 , @entity53 , allows for many household pets , including dogs , provided that they are vaccinated and under forty pounds			1
and the @entity16 at @entity17 in @entity18 has provided a designated " pet wing , " home to a variety of small caged animals and cats since 1996			1
while animal companionship is largely viewed as a welcome addition to family homes , there are many roadblocks that have deterred @entity5 from altering its pet policy			1
" we do n't have a policy that allows for dogs or cats or ferrets or monkeys -- you name it -- and ... the main reason is so many people have allergic reactions to animal dander , " @entity69 @entity68 said			1
" it 's one thing in a family , where everyone agrees that this is what they want and no one has an allergic reaction to the animal			0
but in a residence hall , where there is no such communication or agreement , it 's hard and people are affected			0
" while @entity5 students are currently not permitted to have more than a small fish tank in the dorm setting -- in addition to service animals -- this has not always been the case			1
during a failed experiment that ended around a decade ago , faculty members , residence directors and graduate teaching assistants were allowed to own pets in an attempt to encourage residence			1
" we were trying to entice [ people ] to come live in the halls , and ... they would n't come unless you allowed the pets , " @entity68 said			2
" in order to pragmatically get [ them ] to come in , we said ' okay , let 's do this			0
' then people said , ' no , this is n't fair , i ca n't live here			0
' not many students complained , but enough did			2
" according to dr. @entity125 , medical director of @entity126 , the prevalence of allergies and asthma on campus would make a more lenient pet policy problematic			2
in addition , dorm cleanliness would be noticeably impaired by the allowance of pets , she said			1
" pets need to be taken care of ... litter boxes need to be cleaned daily , " @entity125 said			1
" the dorm rooms were not built with the need to ventilate for that type of situation			2
and what about fleas ? once they are introduced , they would spread rapidly through all of the furniture			2
i do not see students being able to care for animals adequately in the dorm setting			1
" even without canines currently roaming the quad , there has been a modest history of animal neglect that calls into question a student 's ability to provide for an animal properly			2
" i think some fraternities in recent years did have animals , " @entity68 said			0
" there were concerns or complaints when spring break came along , because there is this animal , not cared for ... the animal activists came in here and said , ' that 's no way to treat an animal , ' " @entity68 said			0
" a residence facility -- be it a sorority , fraternity or residence hall -- is not necessarily a good fit for the animal			0
" @entity68 said he had reservations about allowing pets in designated residence halls , like @entity32 does			1
" if you designate certain buildings as ' pet buildings , ' you are taking that building , in essence , from people who do n't want to live in that type of environment , " @entity68 said			2
" you ca n't do that with very popular halls that go first in the lottery , because there would be no end to complaints about that			0
you just get into this equity political - pragmatics issue pretty quickly			0
" " developing pet - specific dorms would be a huge logistical struggle , " @entity125 said			2
" once pets have been in a specific room , that room is ' contaminated ' with pet dander and will be ' allergic ' for extended periods			1
" but a number of studies have been released touting the psychological benefits of owning a pet , arguing that the relationship serves as a daily de-stress mechanism and source of increased happiness			2
while @entity68 viewed the calming influence of a pet - owner bond as beneficial , he associated the necessity of pet companionship with two distinct groups , neither of which includes college students			1
" i 'll say the usefulness in ownership and responsibility for the aged and the young jumps off the page to me , " @entity68 said			0
" for older folks ... the companionship and presence of the animal is life sustaining in a lot of ways , " @entity68 said			0
" for young kids and teenagers , the responsibility of pet ownership is a great model for taking on a commitment			2
it 's clearly needed , but probably a little less so in our middle years			0
" sophomore @entity244 , who suffers from asthma , said it is a bad idea to allow pets in residence halls			0
" i would n't love it if cats were allowed just because being anywhere near them makes me sick ... my breathing tubes start to close , " @entity244 said			0
" i also feel like people usually have too much going on to really take care of a pet , especially now in college when you are already doing so much that takes a lot of effort			1
" " i do n't think it 's fair to other people who are living in the dorms because everybody needs to agree that they want an animal in their dorm , " junior @entity262 said			0
" it 's not only you and your roommate , but you 're sharing a huge space with everyone else			0
it would also cause a lot of mess and possible destruction to school property			1
" still , @entity280 admitted that she would n't rule out the possibility of owning a pet if the policy changed			0
" i would consider bringing a pet , but i would only go for small pets -- maybe a hamster or gerbil , " she said			1
" never a cat , though , or a dog			0
