-- politics might be a tough profession , but in few places is it as bruising as in @entity5 where mudslinging and name - calling occur on an almost daily basis in parliament			1
to outsiders , the @entity5 parliament can look like a bear pit and throughout its history , it 's had some legendary brawlers			1
@entity16 , @entity5 's fourth prime minister from 1904 to 1905 was famously heckled in parliament over his fat stomach when an opposition politician shouted from the benches : " what are you going to call it ? " without pausing for breath @entity16 shot back : " if it 's a boy , i 'll call it after myself			1
if it 's a girl , i 'll call it @entity31			0
but if , as i strongly suspect , it 's nothing but p * * * and wind , i 'll name it after you			0
" in many respects , @entity5 's electorate expects its politicians to come out of this mold and few have disappointed			1
former prime minister @entity41 ( 1991 - 96 ) , when pressed to name an election date , told the leader of the opposition he would n't reveal the date because , as he said : " i want to do you slowly			0
" more recently , former prime minister @entity46 gave the opposition a spirited lecture in sexism that went viral and even drew praise from @entity52 president @entity51			0
but not since leader of the @entity55 opposition @entity56 broke a taxi driver 's arm in a dispute over a cab fare in 2001 have @entity5 had the chance to elect a real brawler as premier			1
@entity56 's bid for prime minister failed , but in @entity67 , the leader of the @entity69 - @entity68 who is tipped to be @entity5 's next leader , the country may have found a natural successor			1
combative in debate and with the media , @entity67 may have shown little of his predecessors ' verbal flair -- recent gaffes had him talking about the " suppository , " rather than the repository , " of all wisdom " and praising a female candidate for her " sex appeal " -- but he has displayed the kind of dogged aggression that @entity5 like to see in their sportsmen			1
so far , it 's played well with the electorate			0
the boxer a former @entity89 who won an @entity90 in boxing , he allegedly punched the wall either side of the head of a female political rival during his student days in the 1970s			0
@entity67 claims the incident " never happened			2
" for one former alumni from his @entity101 secondary school @entity100 , @entity102 , in @entity103 , the episode would not have been out of character			0
" all i remember is his rictus grin and the rolled - up sleeves of his short - sleeved shirt , giving his biceps something to rub up against , " the former classmate , who now works in the @entity107 banking industry , told @entity0			0
" what struck me was the raw emotion he could elicit just by being him			0
you could pour an enormous bucket on him , and he was not only impervious in terms of being hurt but would grin back at you and give it back -- with compound interest and probably a compound fracture , " he added			0
while @entity67 is a polarizing and pugnacious character to the electorate , the socially conservative politician is known to hold complex views in some areas of policy			1

early beginnings born in @entity146 in 1957 to an @entity5 mother and an @entity146 - born father , he graduated in economics and law from @entity151 where he became involved in the rough and tumble world of student politics			1
avowedly right - wing at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy on campuses was deeply left - wing , @entity67 , according to one of his biographers @entity161 , was beaten up at a student conference			2
briefly training as a catholic priest before working variously as a concrete contractor and as a journalist for the @entity5 newspaper , he entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to represent the affluent @entity170 district of @entity103			1
under former prime minister @entity172 's government , he served as an employment minister between 1998 and 2001 , and as minister for health and aging in 2003			0
in 2009 , he narrowly beat then leader @entity176 in a party leadership vote , winning 42 votes to @entity176 's 41			2
he also polled well in @entity5 's 2010 general election , which was called following @entity46 's ouster of @entity181 as prime minister , denying the government a majority and delivering a hung parliament that @entity46 's government could only hold together with the support of independents			1
@entity55 infighting boosted @entity67 's standing in the polls and -- under @entity46 -- the @entity55 faced certain defeat at elections this year			1
while the installation of @entity181 as prime minister for a second time has clawed back some of the ground @entity55 lost under @entity46 , many analysts say his arrival has come too late to save the @entity55			0
catholic values , populist instincts @entity67 supports lower taxes , smaller government and tough border controls and backs the government 's policy of processing asylum seekers -- many of them illegal boat arrivals -- offshore			2
he recently announced that almost 32,00 asylum seekers who already in @entity5 will never be granted permanent settlement			2
he has also pushed a " tow - back " policy that would see asylum seekers ' boats turned around when it is safe to do so			0
dismissing the climate debate as faddish and fashionable , @entity67 has vowed to roll back the controversial carbon tax put in place by @entity46 , which he has condemned as " socialism masquerading as environmentalism			2
" he has pledged to get rid of the 30 % mining tax introduced by @entity55 , saying that it is a serious disincentive to investment in @entity5 's booming commodities sector			1

@entity5 journalist @entity242 , author of @entity67 's latest biography " the making of @entity67 , " says the leading contender to become @entity5 's next prime minister is nothing if not the sum total of his contradictions			1
" he is a highly successful , aggressive , populist politician but all throughout his career he has argued there is another side to him -- that there is a deep commitment to values -- and they are very traditional @entity259 values , " he told @entity250 's @entity249			2
however , he added that while his values informed his political views , he was able to shift and adapt them to prevailing political reality			0
" there 's no occasion in his political career where those values have stood in the way of his politics			2
when it comes down to it , @entity67 is an absolutely secular politician			0

the socially conservative @entity259 has a pugnacious character that plays well with his base
