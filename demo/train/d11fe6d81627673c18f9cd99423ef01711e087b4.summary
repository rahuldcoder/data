-- hondurans will answer two questions sunday when the troubled @entity4 nation holds elections : who will win the presidency , and will voters heed calls for a boycott ? the answer to a third question will remain unanswered for a while : will the international community recognize the newly elected leader even though the vote was held under the stewardship of interim president @entity18 , who came to power after a coup ? " the government needs a strong turnout and limited irregularities in order to claim that the elections are legitimate , especially given that there will not be international observers from the [ @entity32 ] or the @entity33 , " said @entity21 , a @entity22 analyst with the @entity24 consulting firm			1

the pact said @entity81 would vote on @entity34 's return to power after consultation with the nation 's @entity102 and other bodies			2
the vote was supposed to be held within a week but now is set for next week after the elections			0
the @entity102 ruled 14 - 1 this week that @entity34 can not return to office without facing trial first on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when trying to hold a vote that could have led to the lifting of presidential term limits			2
the @entity102 had ruled that the vote was illegal , and @entity81 had forbidden it			0
