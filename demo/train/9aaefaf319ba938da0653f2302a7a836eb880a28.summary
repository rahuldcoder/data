-- when @entity2 asked his staff why all the applicants for cabinet positions seemed to be men , as he recounted in the presidential debate tuesday night , he was apparently told that only men had " the qualifications			1
" that is obviously not true			0
but this story , as well as , of course , the infamous " binders " comment , provide a good opportunity to talk about women 's issues beyond the two perennials , abortion and contraception			1
as we near the end of 2012 , our society still struggles with women 's full integration into the workforce and men 's full participation on the home front			1
indeed , @entity2 's comments illustrate the continued superficial treatment these issues receive , not only by many political leaders , but also by society as a whole			1
let 's look at , for example , some basic -- yet wrong -- assumptions about women 's qualifications for high - level positions			2
women 's college graduation rates now surpass those of men			1
for the past decade , women have outnumbered men in law school admissions			0
more than 50 % of those in management and professional specialties are women			0
and similar trends are evident in secondary education , the professoriate , and college and university administrations			0
many @entity60 women held appropriate credentials			0
politics : @entity63 , @entity2 equal on gender pay inequality so , why did n't these women appear on @entity2 's radar screen until after the organizers of @entity68 supplied the now - derided binders ? perhaps the administration held the common view that women suitable for leadership positions are exceptional or rare			1
maybe they thought that women have so many competing obligations that they would not be available for high - level political jobs			2
maybe the @entity2 inner circle recruited only from its own male - dominated ranks			2
whatever the reasons , women 's full integration into the workforce was an afterthought			2
the " binders " comment also touched on the stickiness of traditional gender roles			0
@entity2 said he " recognized that if you 're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible			1
" his example of flexibility , however , was allowing his chief of staff to " get home at 5 " to make dinner for her family and be with her children			2
he stopped short of saying it directly , but @entity2 appears to hold a common belief that women can best be integrated into the workforce if they are still able to fulfill their duties as wives and mothers			1
women 's rights organizations fought for decades to dismantle laws that limited women 's abilities to compete for jobs			2
but informal restrictions still limit women 's success , because the progress in the workplace has not been met by any similar shift on the home front			1
politics : @entity2 in a bind over ' binders of women ' comment a 2011 national survey of thousands of lawyers , business leaders , educators and political activists , for example , revealed that women and men tend to assume traditional gender roles			1
the report showed that in families where both adults worked ( generally in high - level careers ) , women were roughly six times more likely than men to handle most household tasks , and about 10 times more likely to be the primary childcare provider			0
as long as workplace flexibility is viewed as a " female thing , " then it 's likely that cooking dinner will be viewed that way , too			1
@entity2 's casual comment reflects an assumption that women who work outside the home do so as an " add on " to family responsibilities			1
the " second shift " that characterized the distribution of household labor for women in the 1990s is obviously still alive and well			2
in fact , a substantial , multidisciplinary literature affirms the challenges of work / family balance that professional women face			0
hundreds of studies have analyzed the programs and policies that work best to ameliorate these difficult circumstances			0
the mere existence of this burgeoning literature shows that balancing family roles with professional responsibilities is part of the bargain for contemporary women			2
it 's simply the new normal			0
and it does n't involve any shift in behavior by men			0
opinion : @entity2 's empty ' binders full of women ' finally , @entity2 's comments embody the faulty assumption that adding some female faces to a group or organization is all you need for full integration and representation			1
but it 's only the first step			0
leaders must continue to develop and promote policies that allow women equal access to the workplace			0
that a presidential candidate in 2012 can utter such superficial answers to a serious question about women 's economic equity and autonomy reveals a lack of serious thought about issues of substantive importance to women			1
it also demonstrates a lack of commitment to the change necessary to allow women and men to lead fully integrated professional and personal lives			0
poll : what are the most important women 's issues ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 and @entity222 .			0

**writers** : @entity2 's story about finding qualified women shows old ideas on working women
women are *ahead* in college degrees , many *fields* . why not on @entity2 's radar ?
they say his view of ' workplace flexibility ' is for women to get home to " second shift "
**writers** : comments show little understanding , serious thought on workplace equity for women
