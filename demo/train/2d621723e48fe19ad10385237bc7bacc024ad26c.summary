-- for many gamers , recent news stories about potential security breaches , lost data or lifted financial information were missing the most basic , most important point : when do i get to play again ? @entity10 's @entity9 breach was one of those things that was n't supposed to happen			1
and the subsequent network crash was one of those things many gamers really , really , really did n't want to happen			1
sure , gamers could play locally , off - network -- as in " by yourself			2
" but that can be a little like playing tennis " by yourself			2
" which potentially ( if not inevitably ) leads to heat exhaustion , sun poisoning , and never being able to track down where all the fuzzy little balls went			0
and , to some , it seemed like @entity10 was n't terribly forthcoming about what had happened or , during those first few days , that anything significant had happened			1
those observations appear to have crossed the minds of rep. @entity33 , @entity34 , and rep. @entity35 , @entity37 - @entity36			0
the @entity9 breach affects millions of potential young voters , so @entity40 got into the act , asking @entity10 to do some explaining			1
in a letter to its chairman , a @entity45 subcommittee on @entity46 asked why @entity10 waited so long to notify customers about the breach			1
@entity33 and @entity35 asked how they could be confident credit card information was n't stolen and if @entity10 knew the identity of those responsible			1
or , to paraphrase their letter : " dear @entity10 , come on , when do we get to play @entity55 ? later , @entity40			1
" @entity10 has said that the network will be up this week			1
and here we are on thursday afternoon , with no game			0
until the network is back up and running at full strength , how are gamers dealing with the outage ? @entity61 ? pointing ps3 controller at their televisions and muttering , weeping ? practicing knife kills on mall security while clutching rubber spatulas ? " @entity71 people always talk about their hardware being better , " said @entity68 , a 27 - year - old gamer from @entity69			1
" so for all the @entity75 people , this is hysterical to them			0
i 've got a @entity71 and an @entity75 , so i 'm in both camps			0
but , you see now why @entity80 service costs money			2
it has that added security -- that 's part of what you 're paying for			2
it 's more secure , so it 's more safe			2
" " still , " @entity68 said , " i took my credit card information off the @entity75 servers yesterday			0
" @entity90 works in the gaming industry and lives in @entity92 , @entity93			0
in her home she plays on a @entity71 , @entity95 and a @entity96			0
" some games play better on one system or are n't available on another , " she said			1
" @entity100 is only available on the @entity95			0
portal 2 seemed like it would be better on the @entity71 as opposed to the @entity95			0
the @entity96 seemed like a good idea at the time , but it hardly gets touched ever			1
" @entity90 is still a fan of @entity10 but is waiting for some answers from the tech giant			2
" i 'd love to know how easy it was for @entity10 's security to get compromised , how much credit card information was leaked and how far back it goes , " she said			1
" @entity109 was my information from when i played @entity111 over seven years ago still stored in their system ? " as impatient gamers from all over the world wistfully pick up their familiar , even comforting , ergonomic @entity71 game controller , many are asking the same question @entity90 is : " i 'd also love to know what @entity10 is doing to prevent this from happening again			1
" from his @entity122 home , @entity120 said he 's frustrated by the @entity9 outage and has been spending more time on @entity125 's system			1
" i just wish my @entity75 did n't sound like a helicopter taking off when i switch it on , " he said			2
@entity120 feels a big part of @entity10 's job will be getting the network back up			1
another big part ? a type of digital mea culpa tour			0
" @entity10 does need to figure some form of grand gesture back to their customers , " @entity120 said			1
" what with @entity140 being hacked as well , this could be a lingering black mark against their reputation			0
i honestly do n't know what it will take , but they may want to look at how @entity145 handled the @entity147 antenna debacle			0
" ( @entity148 ! contacted @entity10 for a comment on this article but as of this publishing the company has not responded			2
however they have responded to @entity40 with a letter			0
) when the @entity9 does come back online , it 'll be coming up slowly , not all at once			0
@entity10 will also fire up a " @entity157 " program to encourage its customers to re-embrace the @entity9			2
initial indications from @entity10 are that they 'll give current @entity9 customers the premium service , @entity161 , free for 30 days			1
current @entity161 customers may also get 30 days free			2
@entity163 , the founder of @entity164 , does n't need the freebies			0
she said she 's sticking with @entity9 because no matter how hard they firewall an open network , there will always be some amount of vulnerability			0
" no personal information stored online is ever 100 % safe , if someone wants it bad enough			0
i 'm still a fan of @entity10 's @entity9 , though , " she said			1
" i 've never had the ' @entity173 ' on my @entity71			0

playing @entity161 games *offline* is n't a gamer 's idea of a good time
the breach makes gamers look *positively* at @entity80 's system
gamers *suggest* @entity10 give them a " grand gesture " of good faith
