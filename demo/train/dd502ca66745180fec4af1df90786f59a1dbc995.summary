@entity0 reached the quarterfinals of the 2015 @entity3 with a narrow victory over @entity5 -- but @entity6 and @entity7 now face a drawing of lots on thursday			1
the two teams drew 1 - 1 in @entity13 and can not be separated by their head - to - head records , goal difference or goals scored			1
instead , a random draw will decide which team goes through to play @entity18 on sunday			0
all four teams could have faced the drawing of lots had there been no winners from the group 's final two games			0
the last time lots were drawn at the @entity3 was in 1988 , when @entity27 went through at the expense of @entity0			1
in @entity31 , @entity30 's goal ensured the elephants did not suffer the same fate this year			0
the @entity34 forward guided @entity0 past @entity5 with a 20 - yard first - half strike that evaded goalkeeper @entity36			1
@entity5 coach @entity37 , criticized for his selection of inexperienced players at the tournament , threw on @entity42 striker @entity41 in a bid to wrest control of the game			0
but @entity0 should have had a second through @entity47 and go through as group winners to face @entity27 in the last eight -- perhaps to the frustration of @entity52 managers , with stars like @entity47 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 still wrapped up in the @entity3			1
@entity27 now represents one of the competition 's toughest tests for a generation of @entity0 players who have failed to deliver a major trophy despite their promise -- coming only as close as the final of the @entity66 final in 2012 , where they lost to @entity69			0
@entity6 and @entity7 will become the first teams to draw lots at the @entity3 for 27 years after a game dominated by back - to - back penalties			1
@entity74 chipped home from the spot to put @entity6 ahead in the 15th minute , after @entity7 's @entity77 had headed the ball onto his own hand			2
@entity7 could have been level instantly as referee @entity81 immediately awarded a second penalty at the other end , but @entity85 's tame effort was easily saved			0
@entity7 's @entity86 found an equalizer as both teams struggled to control themselves -- and the ball -- in a frenetic encounter not helped by a bobbling surface			2
@entity97 , on loan at @entity93 from @entity94 , headed in from the back post early in the second half , but @entity7 could not find a second goal despite a succession of opportunities			2
ten of the 24 @entity66 games played to date at this tournament have now ended 1 - 1 .			0

@entity0 through to @entity3 2015 quarterfinals , @entity5 out
@entity6 and @entity7 will draw lots on thursday for last quarterfinal place
draw means teams can not be separated on head - to - head record , nor goal difference
