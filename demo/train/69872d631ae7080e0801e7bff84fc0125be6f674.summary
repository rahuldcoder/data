-- spoiler alert ! if you want to know how the " @entity4 " series finale ended , keep reading			1
we break it down below			2
@entity8 ( @entity9 ) : she was on trial for allegedly killing @entity12 's ( @entity13 ) abusive stepfather @entity11 , which @entity14 ( @entity15 ) had actually done			1
@entity17 ( @entity18 ) went to see her @entity19 ( @entity20 ) when he got thrown in jail for contempt before their wedding because he refused to answer questions on the stand about an incriminating phone conversation with @entity8			1
@entity17 told him she 'd actually seen something the night of the murder , and the @entity30 , who 'd been eavesdropping on their conversation , threatened to deport @entity19 if @entity17 did n't testify to watching @entity8 walk up her driveway looking disheveled and carrying a shovel			1
@entity8 's lawyer , trip ( @entity35 ) , finally got @entity8 scared enough -- and turned on enough -- that she told him the truth about what happened that night so he would n't be blindsided again			1
she told him he could n't use the information against her friends , but fearing he 'd lose the case -- and @entity8 -- he called @entity12 to the stand			1
@entity8 faked fainting to get a recess			1
@entity14 wanted to come forward and tell the truth , but @entity12 said she 'd confess because the jury would buy her doing it in self - defense but not him , a two - time felon			1
@entity14 told her how much she 'd changed , being willing to sacrifice herself for him , which is why he would n't let her risk it -- their girls need her around as a role model			0
to stop @entity14 , @entity12 put a switchblade in his jacket so the metal detector would go off and the guards would keep @entity14 from entering the courtroom			1
she 'd intended to confess , but someone else beat her to it			0
( more on that below			0
) @entity8 went free , and though she claimed she was refusing to see trip because of his betrayal , it was really because she could n't believe that he would want to be with her knowing all of her faults			1
they eventually reunited at @entity17 's wedding reception			2
they ultimately married and moved to @entity68 , where @entity8 joined a club for conservative women			1
she was elected to the @entity72 state legislature			0
@entity12 ( @entity13 ) : her story line involved a promotion to @entity75 of vip sales at @entity77 's			1
she was spending so much time working , she ended up using @entity14 ' old tricks on him -- buying him a present to apologize for missing dinner			0
so , he used one of her old tricks on her -- he hired a hot gardener , @entity85 ( @entity84 )			0
@entity12 did n't appreciate him joking about the time in her life she 's least proud of ( her affair ) , but his point was that they ca n't go down this road of neglect again			1
she said they would n't , they 're adults now			0
@entity14 helped her start a personal shopping website , which led to her own show on @entity96			0
they bought a mansion in @entity99 and " argued happily ever after			0
" @entity100 ( @entity101 ) : she thought @entity102 ( @entity103 ) invited himself over to her house to tell her he wanted to get back together			0
but instead , because he thought he 'd seen her with another man , he told her he 'd be filing divorce papers the next morning			0
after @entity108 ( @entity109 ) reminded @entity102 how important it is to say things to the one you love when you still have the chance to , @entity102 told @entity100 that even though she 'd moved on and was in love , she 'd always be the love of his life			0
she told him the man she was in love with was him			0
and then ... @entity121 ( @entity120 ) , who is no longer a lesbian , returned to town to offer @entity100 a job in @entity124 heading the @entity126 division of her wildly successful food company ( which sells frozen croissants to @entity130 people )			0
@entity100 said no , but then reconsidered			0
@entity102 said he 'd move wherever to make her happy , only he did n't think she 'd ever feel complete			0
she used her matron of honor toast at @entity17 's wedding to make up with him			2
she told @entity17 and @entity19 that if they ever feel like a piece of their heart is missing and nothing seems to fill it , it 's because it 's already been filled by their love and they simply forgot that			2
@entity100 would 've stayed in town , but @entity102 agreed to move to @entity124			0
@entity100 became a ceo , and they became the owners of a penthouse overlooking @entity149 , where , years later , @entity100 would yell at her six grandchildren			0
@entity151 ( @entity152 ) : she was waiting for the right moment to tell the ladies she 'd be the first one to leave @entity155 so she could help daughter @entity156 ( @entity157 ) raise her baby			1
@entity151 kept trying to fix @entity156 up with her hot young obstetrician , but that was really just to give @entity156 a reason to ask her mother if she thought she 'd ever find love again			1
@entity151 said she may have one more torrid romance in her , but if not , she had enough wonderful memories of @entity167 ( @entity166 ) , who 's dead , and her children to keep her warm at night			1
@entity156 's water broke as she , @entity151 , @entity12 , and @entity17 were in the limo on the way to @entity17 's wedding			1
@entity151 eventually stole the limo to get @entity156 to the hospital ; @entity17 and @entity12 , who insisted on stopping at @entity12 's store to get her a dry wedding dress first , were taking too long			1
@entity17 and @entity12 then had to walk / run to the wedding ( security did n't recognize @entity12 , who was without her work @entity180 )			2
@entity156 gave birth to a healthy baby girl			2
@entity151 told the new owner of her house that @entity155 was anything but boring , and she , @entity156 , @entity156 's daughter , and @entity188 ( @entity189 ) took one last drive around the block			1
@entity151 did n't know it , but everyone who 'd died , including @entity167 and @entity194 ( @entity195 ) , was there to watch her go			2
they were always there , hoping those on the lane would remember that even the most desperate life is wonderful			0
of course , the final shot of the finale showed us the new owner of @entity151 's home , a woman named @entity207 , was hiding a secret of her own			1
some things will never change			0
mrs. @entity210 ( @entity211 ) : she was the real heart of the finale			2
though she 'd wanted to die at home , her doctor told her taking care of her would be too physically demanding for @entity108			0
just as she was about to move into hospice care , @entity151 , @entity8 , @entity100 , and @entity12 offered to take shifts helping @entity108 so she could stay			1
it was @entity12 's turn the night she and @entity14 were arguing over who would confess to the murder , and mrs. @entity210 overheard them			1
she went to court that next morning and told trip he should call her as a witness so she could discredit @entity17 's testimony because she 'd seen her drinking the night she claimed to have seen @entity8 with a shovel			1
instead , mrs. @entity210 confessed to the murder			0
because of her age and illness , the state did n't press charges			0
she was n't done meddling yet : she 'd been wanting @entity8 to find her @entity233 ' " wonderful ! wonderful ! " on vinyl â € ” which she 'd have @entity108 play over and over again as the end neared			2
@entity8 could n't find it , so mrs. @entity210 called trip and asked him to help			2
he was happy to , because of what she 'd done for @entity8			2
@entity108 told @entity8 about trip finding the record and assured her that he was a decent man -- not a manipulative lawyer			2
@entity8 thanked @entity108 for finding the record at @entity17 's wedding reception , which was the start of the conversation that ended with them getting their own happily ever after			1
