@entity0 , @entity1 -- sen. @entity4 's presidential campaign and other @entity5 began circling @entity1 gov. @entity6 in the weeks before @entity4 picked her as his 2008 running mate , according to e-mails from her old office			1
prominent republicans had touted @entity6 as a possible running mate for a few months before			2
but the courtship appears to have accelerated in early august of 2008 , just as the biggest controversy of her administration was gathering steam , according to some of the 24,000 pages of e-mails released by @entity1 's state government friday			1
" governor -- i received a call from @entity24 , @entity25 for @entity4			0
mr. @entity24 was inquiring as to whether or not you would be interested in participating in a @entity29 on wednesday , 08.06.08 , " @entity6 's scheduler , @entity26 , wrote the then - governor on august 4			1
" this would be with their @entity31			0
it has very good attendance on calls			0
it would help the elected official			0
it would be a total of 15 minutes of your time and would be in regards to @entity43			0
" it was not immediately clear whether @entity6 accepted the invitation			2
in her response to @entity47 , she questioned whether she could take part in the call , given a planned trip to southwestern @entity1			0
around the same time , @entity52 sen. @entity51 requested a brief courtesy visit during an august 11 trip to @entity1 's capital @entity0			2
former house speaker @entity56 also e-mailed @entity6 to ask her advice on how @entity1 distributed its oil taxes			2
@entity59 suggested @entity1 's model , which guarantees every resident a cut of the proceeds , could be adopted in other states			0
and the @entity65 had @entity6 lined up for a 9 p.m. speaking slot at the party 's convention in @entity69 on september 2 , the day she eventually delivered her acceptance speech , as early as august 20			1
" @entity65 feels that this is a much better slot for you and they want you on @entity74 , " @entity47 wrote			0
nothing in the documents indicates whether @entity6 knew she was being considered for a slot on the national ticket , and further documents indicate she planned to stay at a @entity80 and return from @entity69 the day after her speech			1
neither her husband , @entity83 , nor infant son , @entity6 , would be able to accompany her , she wrote -- " all the more reason to keep the trip short			2
" @entity4 eventually named @entity6 his choice for vice president on august 29 , catapulting the once - obscure governor into the national spotlight and making her a potential contender for the @entity5 's no. 1 position in 2012			1
state officials released the trove of e-mail -- six 11 - by - 17 - inch boxes worth -- on friday , the result of @entity98 requests dating to her vice presidential nomination			0
about three dozen reporters and photographers crammed into the crowded hallway of a state office building in @entity0 and hauled them away for review friday morning			0
around the same time that she was being considered for the vice presidential nomination , @entity6 was coming under increasing scrutiny over her firing of the state 's public safety commissioner , @entity111			1
@entity111 's backers asserted that @entity6 had fired him because he refused to sack her ex-brother - in - law , a state police officer who had been involved in a bitter custody dispute with @entity6 's sister			1
the flap became known as " @entity117 , " and it dogged @entity6 throughout the remainder of the campaign			2
two investigations came to differing conclusions about her actions : one found she violated state ethics law by using state employees to put pressure on her former in - law , another found she had stayed within the law and little evidence she knew of the actions of her subordinates			0
the first investigation was commissioned by the state legislature , the second requested by @entity6 herself			2
on august 6 , 2008 , @entity6 was told that the @entity133 's investigator , @entity135 , had requested " a laundry list " of records from the governor 's office : " emails , files correspondence , names and addresses of any and all staff that would have any knowledge of @entity111 's firing , " wrote her then - chief of staff , @entity149			1
in the e-mail , one of those released friday , @entity149 adds , " you got to be kidding me			0
" and @entity6 replies , " geez			2
" earlier records in the stash show @entity6 's frustration with complaints about her family 's state - paid travel even before she entered the national spotlight , instructing an aide to remind a reporter " of the family travels w ( with ) me that i have personally pd ( paid ) for			1
" " hopefully our records very clearly show that , " @entity6 wrote on july 10 , 2008			1
" also , my return of every per diem offer for everything related to the kids ... and we need to be proactive in this issue with reminding him of all the steps taken to save state monies like no @entity179 apartment ... no chef ... security down from 7 to 2 , whatever			0
" @entity6 eventually paid back about $ 7,000 for travel expenses for her children after an ethics investigator determined nine trips were questionable			1
the settlement stated that @entity6 did not violate @entity1 's ethics law or commit any wrongdoing , and that she followed the advice of experienced staff			1
a spokesman for her political action committee said friday that the documents show " a governor hard at work			1
" " the thousands upon thousands of e-mails released today show a very engaged governor @entity6 being the ceo of her state , " said @entity196 , treasurer of @entity197 , @entity6 's political action committee			1
meanwhile , in a scandal that rocked @entity1 's political establishment , @entity6 moved quickly to link a key figure to her defeated predecessor , @entity205 , the documents show			1
" fyi -- i 've asked @entity211 to help me track down soem [ sic ] evidence of past administration 's dealing with @entity207 , " @entity6 wrote on may 8 , 2007 , a day after @entity207 pleaded guilty to bribery , extortion and conspiracy			1
@entity6 had beaten @entity205 in 2006 in a primary battle in which she campaigned as a reformer , and backed an unsuccessful 2010 challenge to @entity205 's daughter , @entity219 sen. @entity218			2
@entity207 had been the ceo of the @entity1 oilfield services company @entity220 , and federal prosecutors accused him of leading a scheme to bribe top lawmakers in exchange for favorable state action			0
the scandal disgraced several lawmakers and led to prison time for @entity207			0
aides soon replied that @entity220 had paid $ 15,000 to fly @entity205 and @entity207 to a @entity230 meeting in @entity231 in 2004			0
@entity6 aides also asked @entity207 to resign from a seat on a state board that cultivated ties with the @entity237 province of @entity238 , a request to which @entity207 -- who was later sentenced to three years in prison -- quickly agreed			1
the documents include messages from @entity6 's official account as well as private accounts , according to @entity246 , the administrative director for current gov. @entity247			1
a search was done " in an effort to capture everything in the state e-mail system " that would comply with the request , @entity248 said			0
@entity248 said 2,275 pages are not being released due to legal privileges , while some documents were redacted to remove names			0
e-mails for the remaining 10 months of @entity6 's tenure , leading up to her 2009 resignation , have yet to be released			1
before the release , @entity6 told " @entity264 " that the messages " obviously were n't meant for public consumption , " saying she was sure the material would be taken out of context			0
" i think every rock in the @entity6 household that could ever be kicked over and uncovered anything , it 's already been kicked over , " she said			2
@entity2 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
