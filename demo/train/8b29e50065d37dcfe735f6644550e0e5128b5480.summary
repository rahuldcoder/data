-- protecting drivers and passengers from injury has been a high priority for car makers for the last 40 years or more			1
a truck driver tests an anti-collison system			0
the red light goes on if the car in front of him is too close			0
not just because it 's the right thing to do , but also because having a reputation for building safe vehicles helps automakers sell more cars			1
but in recent years , high - tech advancements have come along at such a fast and furious rate that auto - safety systems have entered a whole new universe			1
for most of the history of auto manufacturing , car makers ' efforts in the area of safety have been devoted to developing " passive " safety features -- seat belts , air bags , building a stronger frame for the cabin , side - impact door beams , etc. all those things help you stay safe once you are involved in an accident			1
but just as advanced technology has changed almost every other industry , so too has it changed the automotive industry , leading to the design of more " active " safety features			0
@entity41 autos : safest cars it started with now - common features like anti-lock brakes ( @entity46 ) and electronic stability control systems ( @entity48 )			1
but in recent years , engineers have taken safety technology to a new level			0
and these days , they spend more time and money researching and developing " crash avoidance " features and technologies			0
these computerized systems , instead of protecting you if a crash occurs , help you avoid accidents in the first place			0
some of these systems are already in vehicles on the road today , while others are coming down the pipeline in the next few years			2
@entity67 uses radar , rear - view monitor given that it 's a higher - priced luxury brand , it figures that @entity67 is one of the leaders when it comes to these kinds of high - tech crash - avoidance systems			1
@entity78 - tuned anti-lock brake and electronic - stability - control systems are standard equipment in all @entity67 cars			1
@entity41 autos : best and worst hybrids " and presently , a number of our vehicles offer @entity89 , a crash - avoidance system that employs dual - band radar that measures the distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you , " said @entity84 , @entity67 ' manager of advanced product planning			1
" if that distance closes too rapidly , indicating that a crash might be imminent , it emits first an audible signal , then a visual warning , and the system can actually start to apply the brakes to a certain threshold			0
" or , if you start to apply the brakes yourself , but not quickly enough to help you avoid impact , our brake assist system applies even more braking power			0
" @entity41 autos : most popular fuel - efficient cars " we also have a @entity111 that uses radar to examine the area just to the rear and to the left of your vehicle , " added @entity108 , product manager for @entity67 ' s - class and @entity110			1
" so when another vehicle , or any object , enters into that blind spot , a red indicator light in your side view mirror lights up			0
and if you start to change lanes while that other car is in your blind spot that also triggers an audio alert to warn you			0
" plus , @entity67 ' @entity129 " views " anything that is directly behind the vehicle as it is backing up , and then projects that image onto the navigation - system screen			1
this feature helps avoid accidents in situations where the vehicle is going in reverse and the driver 's view of oncoming traffic is impaired -- like in parking structures , or when backing out of a driveway on a heavily - trafficked street			2
@entity41 autos : most popular crossover vehicles @entity67 also offers a @entity149 system in the @entity109 and @entity110 , which , at night , " gives you a very sharp , daytime - quality picture of everything that is going on in front of you , " @entity108 said			1
" and it 's projected onto a separate display screen that 's in the middle of the instrument cluster , right in front of you			0
" the " new frontier " of safety technology @entity160 is another car maker where the engineers are excited about its tech - driven crash - avoidance systems -- some currently in use , some still in development			1
@entity41 autos : luxury cars with the best @entity166 " developing new active - safety systems really is the new frontier in safety technology in the auto industry , " said @entity167 , @entity160 's global chief engineer for safety systems			1
@entity160 has owned @entity173 since 1999 , so @entity160 is benefiting from many of @entity173 's renowned safety features			0
" some of the more advanced features that were first offered in @entity173 's vehicles are cascading down into the @entity160 product line , due to our engineers working together with theirs , " @entity167 said			0
one @entity160 system in development addresses the fact that many accidents happen because drivers are n't paying attention			0
" studies have shown that in 50 percent of accidents , the drivers never even stepped on the brake , " @entity167 said			0
so , one technology that excites @entity167 is the " collision mitigation system " that originated in the 2007 @entity192 and will be cascading into the @entity160 product line in the near future			0
" it senses that that the car ahead of you is coming to a rapid stop , so if you 're not paying attention , it essentially tells you to ' wake up and do something , ' " @entity167 explained			2
" with this system , there is a light mounted at the top of the instrument panel that reflects into the windshield , it 's essentially a heads - up display , so in this kind of panic situation , that light will illuminate plus you get an audio alert telling you it 's time to take action			2
" @entity160 is also presently developing a blind - spot alert system ( for early ' 09 rollout ) and a lane - departure warning system ( similar to those offered in @entity67 vehicles ) -- technologies that also originated in @entity173 vehicles			1
" one interesting aspect of the lane - departure system that we 're working on is that it may involve ' tactile input ' in addition to an audio warning , " @entity167 said			2
that is , when you 're coming up too fast on the car ahead of you , " you could get a vibrating sensation in the car seat or steering wheel			0
" from roll mitigation to trailer stability -- and more meanwhile , @entity234 is " devoting plenty of resources and doing a lot of system - development work devoted to trying to mitigate a crash , " said @entity233 , @entity234 's director for active and passive safety systems			1
one such crash - avoidance system currently employed in various @entity234 / @entity244 / @entity243 vehicles is an electronic @entity245			1
" it senses when the vehicle is in danger or is moving sideways at a rapid pace , which could lead to a rollover , " @entity233 explained			2
" so it applies more brake pressure to the outside front wheel , which corrects the lateral motion and keeps the car moving forward			2
" @entity234 's own version of a computerized @entity258 system helps in another situation that is all too common , @entity233 said			1
" many times , in an emergency - braking situation , drivers will initially hit the brakes -- but then , unknowingly , let off the brake pedal , which means they lose a lot of stopping distance			0
" so , if they do n't hit the brakes with enough pressure , or do n't brake fast enough , this system will detect that , and automatically applies the optimum amount of brake pressure in the shortest amount of time -- which could go a long way toward avoiding a crash and any resulting injury			0
" another @entity234 feature @entity233 likes is the trailer - stability control system			1
" sometimes , if you 've never towed a trailer before , or if maybe you have too much weight in the rear of the trailer , the trailer can start swaying back and forth , " @entity233 explained			0
" well , this system uses sensors to determine yaw rate and lateral - movement rate , and then provides brake pressure that is counter to the sway of the trailer to get it to settle down			2
" other crash - avoiding features being introduced for the 2009 @entity298 and the @entity299 minivans are @entity234 's own version of the @entity111 system , plus the @entity302 system , which uses an illuminated icon in the mirror and an audible chime to warn you of the presence of an oncoming vehicle when you 're backing up -- like in the parking - structure scenario cited above			1
" we 're trying to take a 360 - degree view all around the vehicle , in order to determine everything we can do to help a person avoid a crash , " @entity233 said .			2
