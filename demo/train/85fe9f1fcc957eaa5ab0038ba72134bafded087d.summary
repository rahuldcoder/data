-- a major winter storm is expected to dump snow and ice across the southeastern @entity4 sunday night and monday , potentially triggering power outages and possibly impacting travel throughout the country			1
the latest computer models show wintry weather extending from northeast @entity10 through the @entity11 , bringing freezing temperatures , snow and ice to areas that normally do n't see heavy winter precipitation , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity17			1
the northern regions of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity11 should expect heavy snow , while ice storms are expected to affect the southern regions of those states , he said			1
below freezing temperatures through tuesday could leave trees and power lines across the south with a heavy coating of ice , said @entity17 , which could cause numerous long - duration power outages			1
a winter storm warning has been issued by the @entity36 for parts of @entity10 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
the agency warns that significant snow amounts could make travel difficult and dangerous			2
three to eight inches of snow could fall by monday evening and roads are expected to be hazardous through monday night , especially secondary roads			2
a winter storm watch has also been put in place by the weather agency , stretching from northeast @entity10 to the far western corner of @entity51			2
@entity52 should begin falling in @entity53 during the evening hours sunday , @entity17 said , and it should continue to accumulate through monday afternoon			1
temperatures at or below freezing are expected to remain in place through tuesday , keeping roads dangerous and travel difficult , he added			1
@entity17 expects the storm to severely impact @entity53 's @entity59			1
he said hundreds of flights could be cancelled , which would affect air travel all over the @entity4 parts of @entity39 could get up to an inch of ice , while other states in the region could get between a quarter and a half - inch of ice coating power lines , trees , bridges and roadways , @entity0 meteorologist @entity63 said			1
@entity21 's @entity73 began warning residents on friday of the weekend storm			2
" it is really important for @entity21 residents to take this threat of severe weather serious , freezing weather over an extended period of time has the potential to cause power outages and an interruption in communication services , " @entity21 ema director @entity76 said in a statement			2
meanwhile , airlines were preparing for possible travel snarls ahead of the storm			1
" our big concern from an operating stand point is @entity93			0
it depends on how quickly the snow moves eastward , " said @entity95 spokesman @entity94			0
@entity4 had not canceled any flights in the region as of saturday morning , but was monitoring the forecast , @entity94 said			1
@entity101 , a spokesman for @entity102 , said the airline expects " to start seeing an impact tomorrow night ( sunday ) around 6 p.m. " " we will have flights canceled beginning then ( and ) probably through until as late as early tuesday morning , " @entity101 said			1
meanwhile , snow moved into the @entity108 but the region was spared a repeat of the @entity112 blizzard that virtually shut down such large cities as @entity114 and @entity115			0
emergency management officials were able to quickly recover from the comparably light dusting of snow that began blanketing the region friday			0
@entity120 had canceled only three flights saturday morning into or out of @entity114 's @entity124 and @entity125 's @entity123 airports			0
all of the major airports were operating as normal saturday with the exception of @entity128 , which was under a ground delay due to the snowfall			0
" in addition to being under an air traffic control ground delay program , they 're also de-icing aircrafts and that could tend to slow things down , " @entity132 spokesman @entity131 said			0
more than 400 flights were canceled friday due to the storm			0
several major airlines -- including @entity4 , @entity142 / @entity141 , @entity143 and @entity102 -- announced that their customers could voluntarily reschedule flights to and from snow - affected areas without penalty			1
the heavy snow over the @entity112 weekend hampered morning commuters , delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours , officials said			0
following sharp criticism of the city 's slow response , @entity159 , the chief of the sanitation department , has made management and personnel shake - ups in @entity164			0
an investigation is currently under way into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations about demotions and citywide budget cuts			0
