-- the first decade of the 21st century in the @entity1 was defined by terrorism , crisis and uncertainty			1
the exuberance of the 1990s , with its strong economic growth and the sense of @entity9 military omnipotence , came to an end			1
most @entity1 have been left reeling from nine very difficult years , even though the decade neared its close with a presidential election that spoke to the promise and potential of the nation			1
we must remember that any " most important " list should be seen as the beginning of a conversation , not a definitive judgment			1
historians learn that it is extraordinarily difficult to discern exactly which events will be transitory and which will have the most long - lasting effects			2
@entity27 : share 10 photos from the past 10 years some moments that seem to be turning points shortly after they happen , such as @entity31 in 1990 - 1991 , seem less important over time			2
others that we do n't pay as much attention to , such as the first bombing of the @entity36 in 1993 , look much more consequential with the passage of time			0
september 11 , 2001 the tragic moment when terror struck in @entity41 and at the @entity42 will be at the top of everyone 's " most important " list			1
when terrorism caused such devastating damage , the perpetrators defined the central national security challenge confronting the @entity1 and much of the world : stateless terrorism			1
even though the nation had faced terrorism for several decades , including the first attack on the @entity36 in 1993 and the @entity55 bombing in 1995 , nothing compares to 9/11 in scale and scope			1
the event shattered the sense of confidence that many @entity1 had about being able to avoid the kinds of attacks on civilians that had become commonplace in the @entity65			0
@entity9 national security policy was reconfigured as a result			0
the federal government vastly expanded and reorganized its homeland defense system			0
it instituted an aggressive program of interrogation and surveillance to combat terrorist threats and refocused foreign policy to concentrate on destroying these networks and the states that support them , including the invasion of @entity80 to topple the @entity82 regime			0
eight years later , we are still fighting			0
@entity84 the war with @entity86 quickly became one of the most controversial aspects of the war on terrorism			1
the difficulties that the @entity1 encountered in the reconstruction period , and the falsity of the @entity96 administration 's claims in the build up to war that @entity98 had weapons of mass destruction , opened up the administration to intensified attacks from the left and the right			0
the war eroded @entity96 's political capital and constrained his ability to achieve other objectives , including domestic proposals such as @entity111 privatization			0
equally important , the difficulties the nation encountered in achieving its goal of creating a stable democracy and combating insurgents has raised serious doubts -- domestically and internationally -- about the capacity of @entity9 military power in conflicts , including the war in @entity80			2
@entity121 when @entity121 devastated @entity123 in 2005 , it revealed the horrible conditions under which many inner - city @entity125 were living after decades of neglect			1
the failure of so many levels of government to properly respond to the hurricane and its aftermath also exposed the limited interest of the government -- and the public -- in protecting these @entity9 communities even after a tragedy this severe			0
the unwillingness of the federal government to commit substantial resources to the reconstruction effort confirmed that urban @entity1 was not central to the national agenda			0
financial crisis of 2008 the financial crisis constituted a huge shock to the economic system			1
as september 11 ended a false sense of physical security within our borders , the financial crisis shattered the economic confidence which had emerged in the 1990s and established the parameters for president @entity155 's administration			1
the plummeting market fundamentally challenged decades of policies that centered on deregulation and market - based solutions			0
the fact that president @entity96 's administration put forth a hugely expansive financial bailout package revealed how @entity1 have come to expect federal intervention in times of economic crisis and showed that there were limits to the @entity168			2
election of 2008 the 2008 election is the one defining event that spoke to @entity1 's potential			1
even though the @entity1 clearly has not entered any kind of post-racial period , as @entity121 revealed , the election of an african - american to the presidency in a country whose economy once revolved around slavery was historic			1
combined with other developments -- such as the growing acceptance of gay rights , despite the setbacks to same - sex marriage -- the election signaled a movement away from discriminatory attitudes that have been so deeply rooted in the @entity9 psyche			0
any most important list is inherently incomplete , and only captures a small part of what the nation experienced			2
should @entity195 pass health care reform , which seems likely , that could become a crucial moment in the history of our government			0
nonetheless , these five events will certainly be ones that historians will look back to for years to come			0
