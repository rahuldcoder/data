editor 's note : dr. @entity2 , a physician , is chancellor for health affairs at @entity4 and chief executive of the @entity6			1
dr. @entity2 says workplace wellness programs could play a key role in health care reform			1
@entity10 , @entity11 ( @entity12 ) -- at the @entity15 earlier this year , a group of corporate executives engaged in a thought - provoking discussion on a variety of health care topics , including workplace wellness programs			1
these @entity20 , representing some of the top companies in the world , shared some of the specifics of their programs , which are taking a variety of approaches to enhance wellness in the workplace , including ways to make such things as regular exercise and healthy eating appealing to employees			1
however , when asked , they agreed that they do n't have any evidence that these programs are having the intended impact on improving health or preventing disease			1
the discussion made me wonder about how powerful these programs could be if they were linked to research - driven targets for behaviors such as weight - loss or monitoring and management of hypertension			1
if done right , could n't these well - meaning -- but currently unmeasured -- programs figure prominently into the health care reform movement and become an effective and economical way to improve the health of @entity53 ? there has been a lot of talk about good health promotion and disease prevention in early discussions of health care reform , but how and whether we achieve these aims will make or break the success of health care reform in whatever form it eventually takes			1
many ideas have been bandied about			0
public education and community programs are important but insufficient since they are difficult to implement broadly and effectively			2
there is a viable mechanism -- already in place -- through which significant improvements in our nation 's health can be made			0
by taking a more organized , standardized and evidence - based approach to employer - sponsored workplace wellness programs , we can create a more effective marriage between public health and prevention			1
it 's a fact -- most @entity53 spend the majority of their waking hours at work			0
the impact of employee health on productivity and cost of health insurance is well documented			0
in response , many medium and large employers have instituted a variety of workplace wellness programs			0
thus , companies are spending money with good intentions			0
unfortunately , there are no national standards or guidelines by which these programs are objectively conducted and measured , making it impossible to know if the various initiatives and their investments are achieving the intended goals			1
meanwhile , reports suggest that 75 percent of our health care costs are spent on chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes , which are largely preventable			0
let 's empower the @entity113 -- the agency charged with keeping tabs on the public 's health -- with identifying specific evidence - based wellness and disease prevention activities , as well as corresponding metrics , to be used as the basis for all workplace wellness programs in the @entity53			1
in exchange for adopting these uniform activities , goals and health metrics , companies and organizations would be eligible to receive meaningful tax credits each year based on their individual performance in meeting these objectives			1
for creative companies and institutions , passing along a financial incentive -- based on tax credits received -- to employees to achieve their wellness objectives could drive a greater commitment to healthy activities			1
and , perhaps an annual ranking of company , or organizational , performance against these national workplace goals and health metrics would foster a healthy competition in the same way that other industry performances are now ranked by national media			2
ultimately , the goal is to have all workplaces conform to national standards and achieve measurable health status of employees just as @entity152 , the @entity152 , measures and enforces standards for workplace safety			1
a program such as the one i 'm suggesting should be relatively easy to implement			0
@entity113 should have access to the data necessary to begin formulating a list of activities and performance metrics			2
most would agree that coming up with such a list would be largely intuitive as the risks associated with high blood pressure , obesity , and type 2 diabetes , to name a few , are well known , but it must also include flu shots , cancer screening and other evidence - based programs			2
in working to ensure that president @entity175 's $ 634 billion health care " downpayment " is spent effectively , we must remember that because companies are already shouldering the cost of these wellness programs , relatively little new money is needed to make them more effective and provide performance incentives			1
such an approach would also , for the first time , provide companies and organizations with an objective basis for making investments in workplace wellness			0
i , for one , would be thrilled to know that our institution 's annual workplace wellness commitment could be effectively measured and a return on investment understood and calculated			0
the most recent figures from the @entity195 suggest that about 64 percent of working @entity53 are employed by companies with 100 or more employees , many of which likely already have some kind of workplace wellness program in place			0
this represents more than 73 million people out of a total workforce of almost 120 million people			0
obviously this idea misses those @entity53 who are uninsured , work in small businesses without workplace wellness programs , or have lost their jobs in the recent economic downturn , and would require some further creative thinking about the implementation of meaningful wellness options that would reach everybody			2
but we must start somewhere			0
tackling health care reform is going to be a long , arduous , necessary and overdue process			0
but , i think it would be a mistake to delay taking meaningful actions to improve the nation 's health as we wait for a solution to the overall health care challenge that could take years			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : companies offer programs to improve health of their workforce
he says programs should be based on national standards to ensure they work
@entity2 : @entity113 should do research to show what standards companies should use
he says *government* should give companies tax credits if their programs succeed
