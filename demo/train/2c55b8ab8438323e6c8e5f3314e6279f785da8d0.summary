-- heavyweight champion @entity1 shrugged off taunts from @entity4 challenger @entity3 on monday after the @entity5 threatened to end his fellow veteran 's days in the boxing ring			1
if trash talk counts , then the 38 - year - old @entity3 has a fighting chance of inflicting the @entity11 's third career defeat in his fifth defense of the belt in @entity14 on saturday			1
he barely let his 39 - year - old opponent get a word in at the start of a press conference in the older @entity1 brother 's adopted home city of @entity21			1
" i really feel for you , but you have made a bad choice			0
you are going to meet an adversary that you have never met before			0
i can hit , box and dodge my opponent 's punches , " boasted @entity3 , who lost to @entity26 when he challenged for the @entity4 title in 1998			1
" i have never prepared so well for a bout			0
when i have finished with @entity1 , they can bring on @entity33 immediately			2
" @entity1 , who has previously hinted that this will be his final year of boxing , was relaxed when he had the chance to reply to his rival , who briefly held the @entity40 title in 2006			1
" it is not easy to find an adversary for me or my brother			0
@entity3 accepted immediately to fight me and i thank him for that , " he said			0
" but when i hear him say he is going to propel me into retirement , that just makes me laugh			0
" i am ready and i am going to show that i deserve to wear this belt , which has been worn by [ @entity49 , @entity26 and @entity50			0
" @entity1 is less pleased with @entity52 champion @entity51 , who has opted to face fellow @entity54 fighter @entity53 on november 13 rather than fight either of the @entity11 duo this year			1
" @entity51 is just chicken , to be honest			2
he 's got a big mouth but nothing more			0
@entity51 is the world 's biggest trash talker , " he told the @entity60 website			2
" but he 's smart enough to understand that if @entity51 made the contract with @entity1 or @entity65 , and he got inside the ring with either one of us , then it would be the finish of his boxing career			1
