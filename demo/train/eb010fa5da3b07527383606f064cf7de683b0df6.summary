-- a @entity3 @entity2 official on wednesday apologized once again for sending an e-mail depicting president @entity5 as a chimpanzee , but insisted she was not motivated by racism			1
" to my fellow @entity15 and everyone else who saw that e-mail and was offended , i humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness for my unwise behavior , " @entity8 told reporters gathered before the @entity11 @entity2 headquarters in @entity12 , @entity3			1
" i say unwise because i did n't stop to think about the historic implications of what i was sending			0
" " unintentionally i have offended many , " @entity8 added			2
" knowing what i now know , i would never have sent the e-mail			2
" @entity8 recently found herself in a storm of controversy after forwarding an e-mail she says she received from a friend			1
it contained a doctored photo styled like a family portrait , showing two adult chimpanzees and a baby			1
the younger chimpanzee had a photo of @entity5 's face superimposed over the animal 's face			1
the caption that ran with the photo read , " now you know why no birth certificate			0
" the chairman of the @entity11 @entity2 , @entity42 , called for her resignation in a @entity46 message posted on the group 's website			0
@entity3 's @entity49 has also demanded that @entity8 step down			1
but during wednesday 's news conference , @entity8 said she would not resign her post , citing an overwhelming number of appeals she has received from her constituency asking her not to do so			1
she represents the state 's @entity56 for the @entity2 @entity58			0
when queried by reporters about who she may have offended , @entity8 responded , " i assume that i offended the black people			2
and having friends that are black i never intended for that , not at all			0
" @entity8 said repeatedly that she is not racist , a sentiment echoed by her husband , @entity66 , who stood at her side as she faced reporters			1
" we 've been involved in many interracial activities , " he said , " and we have no animosity toward any person			0
" the e-mail in question , according to @entity8 , was political satire			1
" i do n't think i would consider it racist , " she told reporters			0
" it 's a political satire			1
pretty much about bringing up the birth certificate , or lack of it			0
it was n't about black , white or other			0
i had no intention of doing anything that would be racist			0
i guess i 'm political and i thought of it only in a political stance			2
" @entity8 went on to say that the e-mail grabbed her attention because of concerns she has about where @entity5 was born and where he went to school			1
" i am concerned , knowing the responsibility of a president , that we should know these things , should n't we ? there are some that are really adamant about it and i wonder why he does n't tell us			0
... from what i hear in the media , he 's not brought forth his college records and his birth certificate			0
" @entity8 is referring to claims made by what is called the " birther " movement			2
these groups believe that the president was not born in the @entity15 and his birth certificate is a forgery , making him ineligible to be president under the @entity15 @entity110			2
@entity5 and his staff produced copies of his birth certificate when he was running for president in 2008			2
despite her professed concerns over his place of birth , @entity8 addressed her apologies directly to @entity5			1
" to the president , i would say absolutely that it was inappropriate and absolutely i would not do that again			0

@entity8 apologizes once again for forwarding e-mail
the e-mail contained a doctored photo of a chimpanzee with @entity5 's face on it
@entity8 insists she is not racist and that she thought the e-mail was " political satire "
@entity8 says she was *focused* on concerns about where the president was born
