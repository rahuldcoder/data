-- artist @entity1 spent the past decade documenting the world 's oldest living things			1
working with biologists , she has traveled to deserts and islands , from the @entity7 to @entity8 , to photograph organisms that are 2,000 years old or older			2
she has given a @entity11 talk about her project			1
her new book of photographs and essays , " the @entity16 in the @entity17 , " came out on @entity18 , april 22			1
follow her on @entity19 : @ @entity20 @entity0 asked @entity1 about her work in an e-mail interview			1
how did you get involved with this project ? before i got the idea for " the @entity16 , " i was searching for something i could really sink my teeth into			1
that search was both an intellectual one -- pondering ideas about combining art with science and philosophical concepts like deep time -- as well as a literal one			0
a visit to @entity36 in 2004 resulted in a surprising and eye - opening adventure to a supposedly 7,000 - year - old tree , which ended up being the ultimate catalyst that brought all these different threads together			1
@entity42 also plays a vital role in my work			0
the ancient survivors i 've photographed have weathered thousands of years in some of the harshest environments on @entity17 , but are now threatened by the climate crisis			1
of all the oldest living things that you came across , what moved you the most ? it 's hard for me to choose , but i was particularly moved by some of the most diminutive organisms			2
we expect to be awed by the grandeur of @entity56 , and they are indeed moving			0
but it was the little beings -- the ones that you 'd have no idea are old at all -- that i found to be the most compelling			0
examples of this include the map lichens in @entity66 that grow only 1 centimeter every 100 years , and the spruce tree on the cover of the book , which , despite its spindly appearance , has been growing clonally for 9,950 years			1
if there 's one place in the world that one must see before one dies , where would it be ? this is a tough question , as i think we should weigh the environmental impact of our travels against the potential for cultural and personal enrichment			2
developing clean energy sources to get us to places should be a global priority			0
what that in mind , some of my travel experiences -- like visiting @entity86 in the @entity87 -- felt more like traveling back in time than visiting a remote location			0
it is stunning , and i 'd love everyone to be able to see through that window back into deep time			0
however , some of the last pristine locations on @entity17 have only remained so because of lack of human contact			0
i urge everyone to travel responsibly , and remember the girl scout motto to always leave a place in better shape than when you found it ! what are a few things that one can start doing today to become more environmentally conscious ? my suggestion is to get involved with @entity109 's fantastic organization , the @entity108			2
whether you spread some truth to the naysayers about climate change , reflect on the things you love that are made possible by a healthy climate , or choose to apply to become a member of the @entity118 , climate reality is building community and momentum around the global fight against the climate crisis			1
who inspires you ? in no particular order some of my favorite people are : @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , the women of art and science that history overlooked or forgot , risk - takers , climate crusaders , makers of eye - opening art , boundary breakers , fighters of injustices , and anyone forging a connection where one did n't previously exist			2
i believe everyone should follow and cultivate their curiosity -- because you never know where it will lead you			0
there is so much to see , know and do in the world , and i hope that we can all get out there -- in our own ways -- and do some good .			0

artist @entity1 's book , " the @entity16 , " comes out on @entity18
@entity1 : when i visited @entity36 i saw a very old tree that inspired my project
she says environment is *important* , and urges all of us to fight climate change
