-- it has been 17 years since @entity2 had a president from the left , but that might be about to change			1
opinion polls continue to favor @entity7 , a candidate from the center - left @entity8 , over center - right incumbent @entity10 in the upcoming @entity2 presidential election			1
if elected , @entity7 would be the first left - wing president since @entity12 in 1995			1
@entity10 is seeking his second five - year term , following @entity14 , who served 12 years in office			2
as the @entity2 take to the polls sunday , here are a few key points to keep in mind : 1			1
this is a two - horse race , but other candidates matter			2
while there are actually 10 candidates taking part in the presidential race , spanning the entire political spectrum , polls show that only two candidates -- @entity10 and @entity7 -- have a realistic chance of winning the @entity2 presidency			1
but it will be important to watch how many votes the other candidates get sunday			0
that 's because those votes will almost certainly be up for grabs in a runoff election two weeks later			1
in @entity2 , a presidential candidate must receive more than 50 % of the vote to win office			2
if no one claims a majority in the first round of voting -- and no one ever has in this current system -- the top two vote - getters advance to a second round of voting			0
" the other candidates have to be given some attention because they exert an influence in the race , " said @entity48 , who teaches a course about the election at the @entity51 in @entity52			2
" for example , if ( far - left candidate @entity56 continues to do well and has even a slightly strong showing , @entity7 might have to tack more to the left in the runoff round			1
" if you 're coming out of the first round with 27 % , 28 % , you need to make it to 50 %			0
so you have to think of where you are going to make up that difference to prevail in the final round			0
" another candidate to watch is on the far right			0
@entity68 , daughter of 2002 presidential finalist @entity70 , is polling well behind @entity10 and @entity7 , but she 's still in the double digits with @entity56			1
a strong showing from her sunday might have an effect on @entity10 's strategy going into the runoff			1
2012 a year of elections : return of the @entity78 ? 2			0
one issue stands out among the rest			0
the economy dominates the political agenda in @entity2 , much like it does in @entity83			0
" basically for months now , the top issues have been unemployment and purchasing power , " said @entity84 , @entity0 's correspondent in @entity85			0
jobs have been difficult to come by , especially for young people , and that is one of the main reasons why @entity10 is vulnerable			0
" even though some people would give @entity10 high marks for doing the kinds of things that might have a positive long - term effect on the economy -- like raising the retirement age to put the system on sounder fiscal footing -- he has n't been successful in bringing jobs back , " @entity48 said			2
comparing @entity10 and @entity7 on their economic policy is not unlike comparing @entity106 and @entity107 in the @entity83			1
" @entity7 is in favor of more government action to stimulate the economy , stimulate spending ... whereas @entity10 wants to improve the climate for business by lowering some taxes , by talking about repealing the law establishing the 35 - hour work week -- a @entity8 measure from the late ' 90s -- to make it possible to work more , " @entity48 said			1
" it 's more of a private - sector approach			0
@entity2 and @entity83 have more in common than just high unemployment			2
immigration , race and the assimilation of @entity2 's large @entity127 community have been prominent issues leading up to the election , even before the march shootings by an @entity132 extremist in @entity133 and @entity134			1
@entity10 has been tough on immigration			2
last year , a law went into effect banning @entity132 face coverings in public places , the so - called burqa ban			0
and in a recent television interview , @entity10 said @entity2 has " too many foreigners " and that the country is not integrating them properly			1
@entity10 won the 2007 election by taking a strong stance on race , according to political analyst @entity148 from the @entity149			1
but @entity150 , this year 's far - right candidate , says @entity10 has n't been strong enough while in office			1
" @entity150 is saying the original is better than the copy , and that voters should not believe @entity10 on race , " he told @entity0			2
the election 's result could affect the eurozone			0
@entity10 has worked closely with @entity160 chancellor @entity159 throughout the @entity162 debt crisis , leading the way for strict austerity measures in @entity165 and other troubled countries			2
would @entity7 's election encourage a change in strategy ? " there is concern that , within the eurozone , @entity7 's election could create greater instability , " @entity48 said			1
" he 's talked about renegotiating some of the accords that have been reached -- at the instigation of @entity10 and @entity159 -- to ensure greater stability in the eurozone			2
" the reason is long - term growth			0
" i think some of the @entity2 like the way ( @entity10 ) handled -- with @entity159 -- the agreement in december to get more rigor , more austerity into @entity162 budgets			1
but then @entity7 and other economists are saying we also need growth , and these plans are going to absolutely stifle growth , " said @entity185 , a @entity2 professor at @entity186 near @entity187 , @entity188			1
like @entity48 , he is teaching a course on the election			0
@entity2 's own debt is also a concern			1
like the @entity83 , the country recently had its @entity198 credit rating downgraded			0
@entity7 has promised to create tens of thousands of public - sector jobs and raise taxes on the rich to pay for it			2
but some are concerned that might encourage the rich to just leave @entity2			0
" there 's some feeling that if @entity7 is elected , the attack on the @entity2 sovereign debt could be quite serious , " @entity204 said			1
" and this is what @entity10 has been saying : ' if you elect @entity7 , we 're going to be losing more than our aaa			1
we 'll be going down even further			0
@entity214 relations should remain strong			0
@entity7 has pledged to remove @entity2 troops from @entity216 by the end of this year if he is elected			1
whether it 's a realistic goal or not , that could create some tension between @entity85 and @entity220			0
but @entity7 is known for being a no - nonsense pragmatist			2
" @entity7 knows that he needs the @entity83 and that the @entity83 needs @entity162 , so i think there would be a great deal of cooperation there , " @entity204 said			0
@entity204 recalled @entity12 's election in 1981 and how there were initial concerns about him			0
" everyone said , ' oh , he 's got four communists in his government , this is going to be the end of the relationship with the @entity83			0
' but it turns out that he was a very strong defender of @entity83 missiles in @entity160 , for example , " @entity204 said			0
" @entity12 's friendship with ( chancellor ) @entity241 , it was a strong @entity2 - @entity160 relationship , and ( @entity83 president @entity244 ) @entity243 and @entity12 did n't get along too badly despite their ideological differences			1

@entity2 's presidential election begins sunday , to be followed by a runoff in two weeks
incumbent @entity10 has been *trailing* center - left @entity7 in the polls
a couple of extreme candidates , both far left and far right , could impact the outcome
unemployment is the biggest issue in the race , but immigration and debt are also talking points
