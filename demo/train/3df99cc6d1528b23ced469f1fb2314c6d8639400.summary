-- after president @entity4 announced his support for same - sex marriage , a group organizing a fundraiser on his behalf suddenly had to find a bigger venue			1
the event , featuring the pop singer @entity9 , is one of two @entity12 - organized fundraisers @entity4 is expected to attend on the @entity13 on wednesday			1
a @entity0 analysis of president @entity4 's biggest fundraisers , known as bundlers , shows that at least 33 -- or about one in every 16 bundlers -- is openly gay			1
together , they have raised at least $ 8 million for the campaign between january and the end of march			1
@entity0 poll : majority of @entity23 say they have gay friends , family members by contrast , in the same period , bundlers from the television , movie and music industry , some of whom attended a recent high - profile fundraiser hosted by actor @entity33 , raised $ 6.8 million , according to the @entity34			1
interactive : celebrities back candidates for president while campaign finance laws require donors to disclose their full names , addresses , occupations and employers , there is no box to check for sexual orientation			2
nor does the law require candidates to release information about their bundlers			0
under prodding from watchdog groups , presidential campaigns have released bundler data in past elections			0
@entity4 's campaign has released its list			1
@entity59 candidate @entity58 's campaign has not			1
in @entity0 's analysis , only bundlers who have disclosed their orientation in past @entity0 reporting or in trusted @entity12 publications were counted as gay			1
the @entity67 has reported that as many as one in six bundlers supporting @entity4 are gay			1
the @entity70 estimates one in five			0
glancing down the names on the bundlers list released by the @entity4 campaign for the first quarter , it is easy to find people known for their work on behalf of the lgbt community			1
@entity79 , a software entrepreneur who runs a large @entity81 - based foundation that backs gay rights projects , has already contributed $ 672,800 with his partner @entity83 to the @entity85 campaign			1
@entity86 , who owns the @entity88 - based @entity87 , has donated $ 1,220,550 so far			2
he co-hosted a $ 35,800 - per - person @entity12 organized fundraiser for @entity4 in february			1
@entity90 , the former president and ceo of the @entity93 , @entity94 - based @entity92 , gave $ 202,150			2
the @entity95 named @entity90 a " @entity96 " in 2000			0
she was instrumental in raising money to stop the anti-same - sex marriage law in @entity94			0
donations made after @entity4 announced his support for same - sex marriage may 9 wo n't be released until mid-june , when the campaign files its second - quarter reports with the @entity104			1
many @entity12 bundlers have maintained a close relationship with the president throughout his first term			0
a state dinner in march was attended by bundlers @entity111 ; @entity86 ; @entity112 , a former @entity113 board member ; @entity114 , senior vice president of @entity115 , a real estate investment trust that owns and operates shopping malls ; @entity118 , a corporate lawyer who has served as co-chair of the @entity4 / @entity120 ; @entity121 , a @entity123 mortgage broker and others			2
support for @entity4 from the @entity12 community was challenged after the initial excitement of his first campaign , largely because of what was perceived as his lukewarm support on same - sex marriage			1
some say a low point came during the election in 2008 , when evangelist pastor @entity135 asked @entity4 how he defined marriage and he called it " a union between a man and a woman			2
" he added : " for me as a @entity142 , it is a sacred union			0
@entity146 's in the mix. " he further angered the community by picking @entity135 to deliver his invocation at the presidential inauguration			0
actor @entity148 wrote in 2010 , " we keep hearing that @entity4 is an ally , that @entity150 [ the ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' policy that kept @entity12 people from openly serving in the military ] will end under his watch , but what do we actually get ? @entity156 squat			1
" @entity161 , who won a best screenplay @entity163 for " milk , " a movie biography of the gay @entity159 politician @entity158 who was gunned down because of his sexual orientation , said last year that he had been an @entity4 supporter before but might sit out the upcoming election			2
when president @entity4 finally signed the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell " and " evolved " in his position on marriage by saying he was in favor of it for the lgbt community , both @entity161 and @entity148 did more than just say they supported the president			2
they also encouraged others to do the same			0
@entity178 , who started one of the first @entity12 - themed pacs in the late 1970s , said the community has come a long way in being accepted in electoral politics			0
" we had some candidates who would n't take our money back then because they did n't want to be associated with anyone who was gay , " @entity178 said			0
he said he believes that changed with the @entity189 administration , which the @entity180 raised $ 4 million to support			1
" now the community knows how to raise money and contribute on their own and we are more than welcome at the table			0
" the @entity12 community is such an important part of this president 's re-election effort that the @entity85 campaign hosts a special section for it on its website			2
it includes a video discussing the president 's support for @entity12 issues narrated by actress @entity206 , who is openly gay			1
it also offers @entity4 merchandise like t - shirts and drink koozies to bring to gay pride events this summer			2
the president has already attended several @entity12 - organized fundraisers , including one in @entity214 hosted by openly gay singer @entity215 , the @entity216 , and @entity4 for @entity217			1
another event in @entity219 , hosted by @entity220 and her partner , dr. @entity221 , was rumored to have raised more than a million dollars for the campaign , although the @entity4 team wo n't comment on the record about fundraising			1
tickets for one of the @entity94 events were selling so well the campaign had to find a larger venue			0
there also is great interest in a @entity88 fundraiser co-hosted by @entity12 bundlers @entity114 and @entity235			0
the couple has already raised $ 288,663 , according to the @entity0 analysis			1
" i think there has always been a strong base of support from @entity12 people for the president , " said @entity238 , spokesperson for the @entity113 , whose incoming president @entity239 is a bundler			0
" he earned even more respect from the community -- from repealing ' @entity150 , ' to signing the hate crimes law giving the first civil rights protection for us in federal law , to coming out against @entity246 , " the @entity246 that defines marriage for federal purposes as unions exclusively between a man and a woman			0
" now , with his saying he believes in full marriage equality , we have another reason for people in our community to be generous with their time and money			0
" it is difficult to know if there are any openly gay bundlers for the @entity269 , because @entity58 has not disclosed his bundler list			1
the @entity59 candidate has , however , voiced his opposition to civil unions and supports a federal amendment to the @entity275 to deny same - sex couples the right to marry			0
but some gay republicans say @entity58 is not totally close minded on @entity12 issues			2
" on gay issues , where @entity58 stands is not as black and white as it seems , " said @entity279 , executive director of the @entity269 , an organization for gay and lesbian @entity59			2
" one thing he has been consistent on , as governor and as a candidate for president , is he has spoken in broad terms about ending discrimination in the workplace			0
he has said there is no room for it			0
" @entity279 said the @entity269 have n't decided yet if they will endorse @entity58			2
that announcement will come sometime this fall			0
he does believe , though , that there are gay donors to @entity58 's campaign			1
they just might not be as outspoken			0
" we joke that at @entity304 ( festivals ) , the question we most often ask other @entity59 we see there is , ' are you out ? ' meaning ' out ' about your politics yet			0

a @entity0 analysis of @entity4 's biggest fundraisers shows about one in every 16 is openly gay
gay fundraisers have raised more than $ 8 million for the @entity4 campaign
similar figures are not available for the @entity58 campaign
