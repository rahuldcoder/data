-- should we worry about mission creep ? only one week after president @entity3 said that he would not send combat troops to fight @entity5 , gen. @entity6 , chairman of the @entity7 , told the @entity8 that @entity13 forces could " accompany @entity10 forces in attacks " if the situation deteriorated			1
as president @entity3 prepares to address the @entity15 this wednesday , @entity13 are naturally wondering where this will all end			0
some have raised the specter of @entity21			1
after all , president @entity22 sent fewer advisors to @entity21 during his presidency than president @entity3 is sending to @entity25 right now			1
@entity26 , a former @entity27 officer at the @entity28 , said that " this is reminiscent of how we got involved in @entity21			1
" mission creep is possible , and indeed it 's likely to happen			1
whenever the @entity13 commits any human capital to a conflict of this size , complexity and danger , the pressure to intensify the nation 's commitment is bound to increase			2
the president has already sent about 1,600 advisors			0
if someone is killed , it would be hard for the @entity13 not to respond			0
if the situation on the ground becomes worse , it would be difficult for the president to do nothing given that he has now acknowledged that @entity5 is a big problem that requires the intervention of the @entity13			1
but that does not mean that this will become another @entity21			1
often , the legitimate and necessary warnings about what can go wrong overstate the risks of intervention and miss the ways in which our political environment has changed since the 1960s , in a way that makes the massive and ultimately futile ground war of @entity21 more difficult to replicate			1
back in the 1960s , the @entity13 had a peacetime draft			2
the system , put in place in 1940 , offered presidents a virtually unending source of military personnel that they could tap into when going to war			1
although presidents @entity22 , @entity71 and @entity72 were cognizant of the political costs of drafting @entity13 into war , the system still provided a huge resource that could be put into place quickly			1
@entity77 dismantled the draft in 1973 , shifting to the use of a professional army , and forever changed the capacity of the president to mobilize large ground forces			2
with a professional military any president has a more finite number of resources			1
there 's also less money for any large scale mobilization			2
during the 1960s and early 1970s , the statutory income tax rates were much higher than today , reaching over 90 % for the highest wage earners			2
a vibrant period of economic growth meant that incomes were rising and relatively more tax revenue came into @entity98			0
this is no longer the case			2
one of the biggest effects of the conservative movement in @entity13 politics , starting with @entity104 's tax cut in 1981 , has been to systematically whittle away at the level of tax resources			1
tax rates have steady declined			0
conservatives have also been extraordinarily effective at making tax increases taboo , so much that even @entity110 have shied away from this policy			0
when the @entity13 went to war against @entity114 and @entity10 after 9/11 , president @entity112 cut taxes even further , abandoning the tradition of raising taxes in time of war			2
this is a far way off from when @entity120 's @entity98 commissioned @entity122 films during @entity123 to convince @entity13 to pay higher taxes to defeat @entity125 and @entity126			0
so too has the growth of pre-committed spending programs such as @entity129 and @entity130 that consume more of the federal budget and leave less discretionary spending for politicians to play around with in any given year			0
the kind of wars @entity13 fights have also changed with new kinds of military technology that have developed along with the sophistication of special operation forces			1
while the promise that new technology will save the nation from ground wars is not new , right now it is increasingly fulfilled			0
the use of drones , for example , has proven incredibly potent at attacking the terrorist networks responsible for 9/11			0
special operations forces have also become increasingly sophisticated and capable of conducting the kind of targeted , small - scale operations that are at the heart of breaking up terrorist operations			0
in the coming months , this kind of warfare will make it possible to combat @entity5 without sizable number of boots on the ground			1
this is certainly not a guarantee that the need for troops wo n't intensify , as was the case in @entity10 , but it does offer an important alternative for the time being			0
another reason that it is harder to have another @entity21 , or @entity10 and @entity114 , for that matter , is because of those wars			1
all of them now loom large in the mind of the public			0
those wars shape every conversation , creating ongoing political concern about every military intervention -- and political pushback as things get messy			1
while policymakers in the 1960s remembered the stalemate in @entity186 they also spoke about the victories of @entity123 the current generation of politicians and voters has grown up in the shadows of unsuccessful and messy wars			0
the only conflicts that seemed to have a better outcome were @entity195 and the bombing of @entity197 and @entity198 in the 1990s -- all short - term , limited conflicts			0
finally , the nature of this conflict is different than what the @entity13 faced in @entity21			2
the conflict against terrorism is not simply about a brute response to ground troops			0
as most policymakers realize , this is a war that revolves around improving intelligence , implementing policies to win over the minds of local populations so that terrorists do not gain hold in communities and stopping the flow of financial resources that keep these networks alive			2
much of the victory will require a political solution			0
a massive infusion of @entity13 troops wo n't have the impact that is needed , and in some ways given the opposition that exists toward western intervention , too many troops could make things worse by rallying @entity10 and @entity25 against the @entity13 rather than @entity5			1
none of this is to say that this war wo n't get bigger and that it ca n't get much uglier quickly			0
but the fact is we are a long way away from @entity21 , and some of the institutional and cultural changes that have taken place -- as a result of that disastrous war -- have created a set of handcuffs on elected officials that wo n't be easily removed .			1

some fear the fight against @entity5 could *expand* via " mission creep "
@entity250 : today 's presidents *constrained* by factors that make another @entity21 unlikely
@entity250 : presidents no longer have the draft and immense budget resources for war
he says public , *chastened* by *recent* wars , is in no mood for major military operations
