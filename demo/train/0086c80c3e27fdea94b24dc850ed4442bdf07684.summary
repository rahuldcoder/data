-- if monday 's inauguration displayed the gushing , ceremonial aspect of @entity5 democracy , wednesday revealed its more sober and confrontational side -- a @entity8 committee hearing			1
the hearing was secretary of state @entity10 vs. the @entity11 on the painful subject of @entity13 , @entity14			1
after a lot of anger from the senators and a surprising amount of emotion from @entity21 , the final score was a draw			1
but some @entity11 did better than others , and @entity21 probably emerges with a healthier reputation than the administration that she 's leaving			1
moreover , the debate throws up some tantalizing " what ifs " about 2016			0
is @entity5 ready for @entity10 vs. @entity30 ? to take @entity21 first , it 's remarkable how much her role as secretary of state has transformed her			1
five things we learned from the @entity13 hearings to conservatives , she was once the @entity40 of liberalism ; the feminist power behind @entity21 's throne whose every utterance seemed calculated to upset the right			1
her book " @entity47 " was greeted like a manifesto of anti-american collectivism -- so much so that @entity50 felt compelled to pen a response called " it takes a family			0
" but secretaries of state often find themselves elevated from partisan politics in to the heavenly realm of " national interest " ( think @entity59 or @entity60 ) , and therein @entity21 has redefined herself as a competent and admirable public servant			1
consider @entity64 's first words at the @entity8 hearing : " we thank you for your outstanding and dedicated service to this nation and ... all over the world where i travel , you are viewed with admiration and respect			1
" given her extraordinary hard work and efforts to advance the rights of women and children , she has certainly earned that respect			0
it 's found in ample supply at home , too			0
according to @entity83 , the former controversialist is now @entity5 's " most admired woman			0
" but even if @entity21 did get through the hearing with her reputation intact , that does n't mean that @entity13 does n't leave scars on the administration			1
the critical -- and most electric -- round of questioning was started by sen. @entity93 , @entity94			0
he demanded to know why @entity21 did n't try to find out what was really happening on the ground sooner and why the administration persisted so long in refusing to label the @entity13 incident a " terrorist attack			1
" opinion : @entity13 blame - game is useless @entity21 's defense was similar to @entity103 's during the presidential election : something went wrong , we did n't want to interfere with ground operations and it took a long time to gather the intelligence to know what really happened			1
but @entity21 lost her cool and summed up that position in a breathtakingly callous phrase : " what difference , at this point , does it make ? it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again , senator			2
" all the difference in the world , i would imagine , to the relatives of the personnel who died			0
this rare loss of composure perhaps underlines the weakness of the administration 's case			1
the @entity134 seems to think -- as @entity135 at the @entity137 website @entity138 puts it bluntly -- " the game ends when they say the magic phrase ' i take responsibility , ' and they win			0
" but it does not			0
part of " learning " from the attack on the @entity5 @entity149 in @entity13 is admitting the basic errors that were made and providing the public with a clearer narrative of what really happened			2
but all we have at the moment are a catalog of errors that make up a very confusing story			0
it 's obvious that the political situation in @entity14 is not more stable since @entity161 was removed from office ( just ask any @entity163 ) , that insufficient security was provided at the consulate , that the administration fumbled its explanation of what occurred on september 11 , 2012 , that the rescue operation was delayed and that the @entity170 had some shadowy role to play in the whole mess			2
@entity21 's assurance that " i do feel responsible " is not reason enough to stop asking these questions and just move on			1
who then made the best case for the prosecution from the @entity11 side ? given that sen. @entity181 of @entity182 was participating , it felt at moments like an audition for 2016 -- and @entity181 's staff put the video of his questions up on his website with remarkable speed			2
@entity21 lays out daunting security challenges in @entity191 but the most impressive performance by far was from @entity30			1
he delivered a cool , withering statement that climaxed in this devastating paragraph ( and you have to watch it to get the full effect ) : " i 'm glad that you 're accepting responsibility			0
i think ultimately with your leaving that you accept the culpability for the worst tragedy since 9/11			0
and i really mean that			0
had i been president and found you did not read the cables from @entity13 and from @entity204 ( @entity206 ) @entity205 , i would have relieved you of your post			2
i think it 's inexcusable			0
" this performance might be -- and should be -- remembered well by the @entity11 base when the primary campaign of 2016 starts			0
ever since the last president election , @entity30 has n't set a foot wrong			2
from his bridge - building visit to @entity216 to his opposition to the fiscal cliff deal , he seems well placed to become the @entity220 candidate			0
and what an unusually satisfying choice @entity21 vs. @entity30 would be			1
it would be a genuine contest between big government liberalism and small government conservatism : @entity21 's internationalism and support for welfare programs vs. @entity30 's anti-interventionism and opposition to pork			1
the question of who could win such an unusual contest is difficult to answer			0
the @entity30 family has a tradition of winning votes from @entity238 , but @entity21 's new respectability could also pull votes away from the @entity11			1
one @entity242 poll found that in a head - to - head contest , she 'd even beat @entity30 in his home state of @entity242			2
it would be a campaign that any elections scholar would relish			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

@entity250 : @entity13 hearing with secretary @entity21 was emotional , confrontational
he says her strong reputation likely intact , but administration still must answer for incident
he says @entity30 's blunt critique pointed up administration 's *obfuscation*
@entity250 : @entity30 vs. @entity21 in 2016 is a compelling idea ; could hearing be a *harbinger* ?
