" @entity4 has maintained its troops used force on the activists in may after they were attacked by those on board one boat			2
soldiers were attacked with knives , metal poles and other objects , @entity4 officials have said			0
but passengers on board the boat insist @entity4 troops fired on them without provocation			0

all additional dealing with this issue is superfluous and unproductive			0
" but @entity4 on wednesday said it was conducting its own investigation and will participate in a panel of inquiry called by @entity49 ban ki - moon			0

after @entity4 forces landed on one vessel , a struggle for control of the ship began			1
@entity4 forces fired at wounded people and killed several people who posed no threat , the report said			1
" the circumstances of the killing of at least six of the passengers were in a manner consistent with an extra-legal , arbitrary and summary execution , " it added			1

in the end , @entity4 made the right decision , @entity89 said recently in testimony before an @entity4 commission looking into the incident			0
the incident left a wide - ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the jewish state and @entity108 , its powerful regional ally , badly shaken			0
