@entity0 -- @entity4 , state and municipal agencies staged an elaborate drill in the waters off @entity0 on tuesday to prepare for the possibility of a nuclear or dirty - bomb attack from the water			1
a @entity12 @entity11 vessel passes a container ship in @entity14 as part of tuesday 's terror drill			2
" we 're a big city , and there are vulnerabilities , " said @entity17 , commissioner of the @entity18			1
agencies involved in tuesday 's test emphasized they did not undertake it because of a specific threat against the city			1
however , @entity17 said the city was taking no chances after a proclamation years ago by @entity29			1
" we do know that @entity29 several years ago obtained a fatwah to use nuclear weapons , and our goal is to make certain that that fatwah does not come to fruition , " he said			0
in addition to increasing various agencies ' preparedness for a seaborne radiological attack , @entity17 said tuesday 's well - publicized drill was meant to deter those who would perpetrate such an attack			1
" it pays to advertise to a certain extent			0
we want anyone who would do us harm to know that we 're out there , that we have the capability to detect , " @entity17 said			1
eight government agencies participated in the drill , ranging from the @entity18 to the @entity11			1
the exercise took place at the entrance of @entity14 , just south of the @entity52 linking @entity53 to @entity54			0
per the drill 's plan , eight boats were to cross a checkpoint set up by authorities			1
they were on the lookout for abnormally high concentrations of radioactivity -- a telltale sign of an improvised nuclear device or a radiological dispersal device , more familiarly known as a dirty bomb			1
some of the boats were decoys with no radioactive substances aboard , while others had actual radioactive isotopes planted in them			2
a radioactivity detector in the hull of the authorities ' boats was to identify which vessels had radioactive substances in them			1
the devices are highly sensitive -- so much so that people who have recently had certain medical treatments can set them off			0
it was up to the authorities participating in the drill to sort the good boats from the bad -- and to intercept the bad			1
only minutes into the six - hour exercise , equipment aboard a police boat detected radioactivity within a small white pleasure craft passing through the checkpoint			2
two patrol vessels then converged on the pleasure craft , while officials began to question the driver and his two passengers			0
soon after , authorities boarded the boat and used a radiation detector , officially known as a radiological isotope identification detector , to produce a " spectrum " of the radiological material			0
they then transmitted the spectrum to the @entity107 's @entity106 ( @entity106 ) in @entity108 to determine precisely what radiological material was aboard the boat			0
within moments , the @entity106 radioed back with a positive identification : @entity113 , an industrial radioactive isotope that if used in large enough quantities could power a devastating dirty bomb			0
sure enough , when a separate boat containing press and police officers sidled up to the apprehended craft soon afterward , the portable radioactivity detectors of officers onboard began to sound excitedly			0
@entity18 sgt. @entity123 said that , in part , the agencies chose to practice on leisure craft to illustrate that radiological weapons could be transported in deceptively benign - looking boats			1
" it does n't require a large vessel			0
a device can be just a few pounds and still be a major threat , " @entity123 said			0
@entity133 , counterterrorism chief for the @entity18 , said exercises like tuesday 's were vital because the stakes involved are so high			2
" someone bringing in a radiological or nuclear device would be very serious if not catastrophic , " he said			0
on an average day , not all incoming maritime traffic in @entity0 is subjected to the radioactivity tests performed at tuesday 's drill			2
an @entity18 official declined to specify what percentage of boats normally undergo such screening .			2

@entity18 commissioner @entity17 : " we 're a big city , and there are vulnerabilities "
participating agencies stressed that the drill was not in *response* to a specific threat
authorities were to *decipher* sinister intent from any of eight boats in waterway
they were on lookout for abnormally high concentrations of radioactivity
