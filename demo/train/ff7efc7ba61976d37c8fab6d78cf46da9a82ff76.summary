-- @entity1 took one for the team , in the form of a $ 15 million pay cut , to protect the staff of @entity7 's " @entity6 " from further cuts			1
an @entity10 representative confirmed friday that the host took a 50 % pay reduction			1
the representative also confirmed that @entity1 extended his contract until september 2014			1
a source with direct knowledge of the situation told @entity0 last month that 20 to 25 employees of " @entity6 " were let go and that @entity1 made the salary concession to prevent even more staff reductions			1
according to the source , the layoffs were part of a plan to adjust the show 's expenses to be more in line with typical late - night programming as opposed to prime - time fare			0
@entity1 replaced the legendary @entity29 as host of " @entity6 " in 1992 , a job he held for 17 years before he left in 2009 to helm " the @entity33 " with a 10 p.m. start time			2
but a few months later , in january 2010 , @entity7 announced that the comedian would return to the 11:35 p.m. time slot			0
the comic 's venture into prime time three years ago was pitched as an attempt by the network to parlay his proven popularity into a commercially successful show			0
but lagging ratings prompted @entity7 executives to change course within a few months			0
that move ultimately led to fellow talk show host @entity48 's departure from the network			0
@entity48 , who had taken over " @entity6 , " now hosts the show " @entity50 " on @entity51 , which , like @entity0 , is a division of @entity52			2
@entity1 jokes about ' @entity6 ' layoffs @entity0 's @entity54 and @entity55 contributed to this report .			2

the cut amounts to $ 15 million , @entity10 says
he also extended contract until 2014 , the network says
" @entity6 " staff was cut by up to 25 employees , source said
