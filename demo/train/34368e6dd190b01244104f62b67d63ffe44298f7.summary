@entity0 -- the son of the @entity4 crime boss @entity3 is set to stand trial in federal court in @entity0 on monday on murder and racketeering charges that could put him in prison for life if he is convicted			1
' @entity12 ' @entity3 's lawyer , @entity11 , talks with reporters outside the federal courthouse			1
three previous racketeering trials against @entity3 , 45 , have ended in mistrials in @entity0			1
the government says it has learned since his previous trial , " that @entity3 had participated in three murders , that @entity3 had run a multi-million dollar cocaine trafficking network , that @entity3 had overseen a systematic effort to tamper with trial juries , grand juries and witnesses , and that @entity3 had participated in various other violent crimes , " according to court documents filed by prosecutors			1
the defense claims the newest round of charges is part of the government 's ongoing quest to convict @entity3			1
the current case was moved to @entity0 in december from @entity36 , where the original indictment was handed up			1
a superseding indictment was filed in the case on august 3			2
in the first indictment , @entity3 was only charged with violating the federal @entity41 , or @entity42			2
the superseding indictment formally charged @entity3 with the drug - related murders of two men -- allegations mentioned as part of the first indictment -- along with the @entity42 charge			1
the @entity42 law is used to target organized crime groups -- in this case , the @entity52 crime family			0
@entity3 's defense attorneys , however , allege in court filings that " the prosecution has engaged in a ' win at all costs ' campaign riddled with misconduct			1
" " the prosecution charges the same conspiracy , albeit with new garnishments , " said one filing from july			0
" after having received frustrating results in three separate trials , the case was hijacked to the @entity66 in a shameful attempt to forum shop or judge shop or both			0
" federal prosecutors , meanwhile , say in court filings that @entity3 's allegations he is a victim of a government vendetta are unfounded			1
since @entity3 's previous trials , prosecutors maintain , they have " uncovered extensive new evidence of @entity3 's criminal conduct in the course of investigating and prosecuting another @entity4 captain			1
" the indictment alleges that @entity3 was at times an " associate , soldier , captain and de facto boss " in the @entity4 , and also served on a " committee of captains " formed in the early 1990s to assist in family administration			2
" the principal purpose of the @entity90 ( @entity52 crime family ) @entity92 was to generate money ... for the @entity95 members , " the indictment says			0
" this purpose was implemented , " the indictment continued , " through various criminal activities , including criminal acts involving the felonious manufacturing , importing , receiving , concealing , buying , selling and otherwise dealing in narcotics and other dangerous drugs , extortion , armed and unarmed robbery , armed home invasions , illegal gambling , extortionate credit transactions , theft and bribery			0
" to further their activities , family members threatened and caused economic injury , the indictment says , as well as threatening and using physical violence " ranging from simple assault to murder			0
" the two murders @entity3 is charged with are those of @entity119 , who died in december 1988 in @entity120 , and @entity121 , slain in november 1991 in @entity120			0
the indictment also accuses @entity3 in connection with a third murder , that of @entity125 in october 1990 in the parking garage of the former @entity127 , but does not allege that murder was drug - related			2
although the murder charges carry a potential death sentence , prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty against @entity3			0
the trial will be the latest chapter in a long legal saga			0
in late 2006 , a third mistrial was declared in a federal case against @entity3 on charges including racketeering and extortion			1
prosecutors said they would not retry @entity3 , who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host @entity143 after the @entity146 founder criticized @entity3 's father on his program			1
@entity143 was shot three times but recovered and testified against the younger @entity3			0
at the time of @entity3 's arrest in august 2008 on the latest charges , his attorney , @entity11 , told reporters he " was very disappointed to have to go through all this again			2
" @entity11 continued , " you can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year , to feel that , ok , perhaps it 's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion , no more			0
it 's very disheartening for him to be back here again			0
" @entity3 's father , @entity166 , was nicknamed the " @entity3 " because prosecutors had trouble making charges against him stick			2
