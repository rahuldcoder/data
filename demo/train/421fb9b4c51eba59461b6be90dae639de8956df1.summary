editor 's note : @entity2 teaches communication , journalism and political science at the @entity6			1
during two decades as @entity8 's " world affairs correspondent , " @entity2 was the network 's most widely traveled reporter			1
@entity2 says the @entity11 's new policy on media access to coffins of war dead is a milestone			1
@entity16 , @entity6 ( @entity8 ) -- the reversal of two decades of policy on images of returning war casualties is an important and welcome milestone for the @entity23 people			1
the @entity11 's decision announced thursday allowing media coverage of coffins of war victims returning to @entity28 -- if families agree -- restores to its rightful , honorable place the immense value of the sacrifice @entity23 troops make on behalf of their nation			1
it allows the @entity23 people to honor the dignified and respectful return of war casualties to home soil for the last time			1
although no one should have a veto over the nation 's ability to pay respects to its fallen troops , i believe most families will decide that their sons and daughters deserve to be recognized publicly for their sacrifice			1
these men and women enlisted in the military for their nation			2
they fought for their nation			2
they died for their nation			0
their return should be respectfully and publicly acknowledged by their nation			0
the ban on images of returning casualties started accidentally , and without any reference to the " privacy " of the families of those who gave their lives in service to the nation			2
the accident of media history occurred in december 1989 when poor @entity71 scheduling placed president @entity72 before live television cameras just as the first @entity23 casualties were arriving at @entity28 from the @entity23 invasion of @entity76			1
@entity8 and two other major tv networks fired up their split - screen technology , showing on one side the president joking with @entity71 reporters just before the @entity83 holiday -- and on the other the sober images of flag - draped military caskets being carried ceremoniously by honor guards across the tarmac at @entity28			1
after the holidays , the president appealed publicly to reporters to " help me " overcome a public impression that he had been insensitive on tv about the returning casualties			2
news media had been covering the return of war casualties since @entity99 some military personnel believe the showing of those images -- and others from the jungles of @entity105 -- contributed to a gradual growth of anti-war sentiment during the 1960s			0
just days before the @entity110 began in january 1991 , the new media policy was formalized in a cable sent by the @entity11 to its posts : there would be no media coverage of returning casualties at @entity28 or other stops along the way home			2
the directive made no mention of anyone 's privacy but portrayed the ban on coverage of returning casualties as an effort to ease pressure on stressed families , who might feel obliged to travel to @entity28 to witness the return of their loved one with news media watching			0
over the next decade , several exceptions were made to the ban on media coverage at @entity28 , including for the return of @entity136 personnel killed in the bombing of the @entity138 off @entity140 's coast , just weeks before the election that brought the second president @entity72 into office			0
ironically , throughout the ban on media coverage of returning casualties , the @entity11 continued documenting this important part of any war by assigning military and government contract photographers to take pictures of the flag - draped caskets			1
those images , among the most poignant , respectful and dignified tributes to troops who died in service of their nation , were carefully maintained by the @entity11			0
they were used for training of honor guards and for commemorating the significance of war casualties			0
although taken by the government , those images were withheld from public view			0
from the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 , through the invasion of @entity168 in march 2003 , the @entity11 kept taking those pictures even as it expanded its ban on media coverage of returning casualties -- now arguing that such war images would somehow invade the privacy of families of the deceased troops			2
it was those images that a series of @entity178 requests pried loose in 2005 after months of legal skirmishing			0
( those requests were initiated by @entity181 , editor of a web site called " @entity183			0
" when the @entity11 refused to respond substantively to my own series of @entity178 requests , the @entity184 at @entity185 and i took the government to court with a lawsuit over the images			0
) just weeks before a federal judge was expected to rule in the case , the @entity11 pre-empted a precedent - setting order by releasing voluntarily more than 700 images of returning casualties			2
they remain to this day available to the public on the @entity184 web site			0
at the time @entity181 and i were seeking to make the @entity11 's pictures public , major @entity23 news organizations were busy suiting up to cover the invasion of @entity168 ; they did not engage their lawyers to ask for access to @entity28 to witness the return of those who sacrificed their lives in the war and they have declined to do so since then			1
the @entity11 policy , which had come into being over the embarrassment of a president , evolved after the @entity23 invasion of @entity168 , into a complete ban preventing the @entity23 people from seeing the most important single measure of the cost of war			1
so desperate , apparently , was the @entity71 desire to block public view of such images that military photographers at @entity28 were ordered to stop documenting the returns			0
to my knowledge , since 2005 , no further photos have been taken showing those emotional moments when a casualty touches home soil for the last time			0
the @entity231 administration 's reversal of two decades of policy on the visibility of returning casualties should have two immediate effects : public opinion -- consistently supportive of making the war casualty images public -- has reached a new high			1
most recently , a @entity239 survey released thursday reported that 67 percent of those questioned said they think the government should allow the public to see photos of caskets of @entity23 troops at an air force base			1
i have had the privilege of speaking with a number of family members who have lost loved ones in @entity253 or @entity168			0
most think the pictures should be public , but only after families authorize it			0
this dramatic change in government policy should once again allow all @entity23 to see the full human cost of war , while paying respect to those who served their nation as well as to their families			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity23 policy on photographing war dead was result of *coincidence*
he says it was *due* to split - screen image of president joking while coffins returning
@entity2 : new policy allows the nation to pay proper respect to war dead
he urges government to resume using its photographers to document the toll
