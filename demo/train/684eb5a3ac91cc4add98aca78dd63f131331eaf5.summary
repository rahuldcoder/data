-- with little notice , @entity3 presidential candidate @entity2 's campaign has been quietly laying the groundwork for an online social network that could be a crucial weapon in his battle to take the @entity8			1
called @entity10 , the platform is tucked away on @entity11 , accessible only if you choose to register on the action page and unadvertised in any proactive way			2
there 's no button pointing to it from the homepage , and the @entity18 looks like it 's only partially finished			0
nevertheless , close to 100,000 @entity2 supporters have created an account on @entity10 , a substantial number at this stage in the race			1
here 's why this could be a big deal			0
in 2008 , @entity28 's campaign built its own social network at @entity30			1
known as @entity32 for short , the platform made it easy for @entity28 supporters to create their own profiles on the campaign website , to write their own blog posts , start or join interest groups , organize their own house parties and , most important , initiate and track their own fundraisers			1
two million people eventually joined , and 35,000 generated more than $ 70 million in campaign contributions from their own personal networks			0
enabling your supporters to visible share their enthusiasm with each other is a powerful way to grow a political network			0
even more useful : the @entity32 platform also allowed the campaign to figure out which supporters were the most passionate activists and to concentrate attention on these " super-volunteers " for a variety of vital tasks			1
while @entity28 's re-election campaign brags about getting its millionth individual donor , basks in its 23 million - strong @entity62 following and spends millions on building a sophisticated online campaign operation , it might be tempting to write off the @entity3 presidential candidates as hopelessly behind in the chase for support on the @entity67			1
but this does n't worry @entity69 , who ran @entity2 's online operation in 2008 and this year worked on the now - defunct @entity72 campaign			1
she said , " do n't count out the @entity3 campaigns in this area yet			2
several of the @entity3 campaigns show promise of going toe - to - toe or besting the @entity28 operation by the time they would come out of the primary as the nominee			2
" right now , @entity10 is n't nearly as robust as @entity82 , but the seeds are there			0
built on the @entity86 content management system by the campaign 's own tech team , @entity10 lets supporters make donations , create their own fundraising pages to rally their friends around , purchase official campaign gear or volunteer by making calls from home on behalf of the campaign			1
on october 15 , the campaign held a @entity99 for volunteers to " share @entity2 's pro-growth message and build support			1
" about 37,000 calls were generated by a couple of thousand volunteers			0
that may not seem like much compared with the 3 million calls the @entity28 campaign says its volunteers made between the beginning of july and the end of september			2
but @entity112 , the campaign 's digital director , says the call - day effort showed that the @entity2 operation is able to activate volunteers from all 50 states			2
@entity112 , whose firm @entity118 rose to prominence running online operations for @entity3 candidates like @entity122 in 2010 , is reticent to provide many details about the @entity2 campaign 's plans for @entity10			1
" we want to make it a platform for people to engage with , " he said			0
when i suggest that this kind of user - centric toolkit is n't standard operating procedure -- the @entity135 campaign offers only a personal fundraising page , for example , and @entity138 makes volunteers fill out an online form and wait to be contacted -- @entity112 demurs			0
" every campaign is going to create a single log - in for their supporters , " he said			0
maybe he 's suggesting that @entity10 is n't worth paying attention to			2
or perhaps he does n't want his competition to realize they 're in danger of being lapped			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

@entity2 's new social media platform may be crucial to his presidential campaign
@entity10 lets supporters make donations , purchase campaign gear , make volunteer calls
close to 100,000 @entity2 supporters have created an account on @entity10
@entity3 are taking a page from @entity28 's 2008 web platform , @entity32
