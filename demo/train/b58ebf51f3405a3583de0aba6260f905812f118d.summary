@entity0 -- @entity2 is not cooperating			1
the mayor of @entity4 knows full well what i want to talk about , and yet he is determined to change the subject to what he believes is a much more pressing story			1
where i want to drag him , my friend refuses to go			0
first , you might be asking what the mayor of @entity15 's seventh - largest city is doing in the second - largest city			1
he 's in town on business , and i 've come up from my home north of @entity21 to have lunch with him			2
but @entity2 is not out of place here : he went to college up the highway at @entity26 , and he has plenty of friends and supporters in @entity30			1
besides , as one of the most prominent @entity33 elected officials in the country , he is a national figure			1
in fact , now that the @entity38 @entity37 has been named one of 30 national co-chairmen for president @entity42 's re-election campaign , we can expect to see him dispatched often over the next several months to some of the most heavily @entity33 cities in @entity30			1
for the 37 - year - old , life is about hustling and constantly being in motion			0
as if to prove it , @entity2 has run the @entity50 ( 13.1 miles ) each time the race has come to @entity4			1
so how ironic that what we are talking about is a proposed artistic re-creation in his city that would depict , among other things , a @entity57 sleeping against a wall			1
that popular and yet offensive image : a @entity57 in a big sombrero asleep against a wall or , more often , under a cactus			1
he 's the @entity57 - @entity15 community 's @entity65 , our cigar store @entity67 , our black @entity70			1
he personifies and perpetuates the wrongheaded idea that the reason @entity73 lost half its territory in the land grab known as the @entity76 and the reason that @entity57 - @entity15 have been mistreated and discriminated against in the century and a half since then is , well , because they were inattentive , passive , asleep			1
in @entity4 , city officials have launched a project to re-create the historic marquee of an iconic drive - in movie theater			1
the problem is that the marquee in question , installed in the late 1940s , depicted the images of a @entity57 in a sombrero asleep against a wall and another @entity73 with a burro			1
we ca n't forget the burro			0
local activists are not amused , calling the images demeaning and racist			0
they 're demanding that the proposed re-creation leave out the offensive images			2
apparently , people in @entity4 have a lot to say about this controversy			1
you know who has n't said anything publicly ? @entity2			1
as a @entity57 - @entity15 , @entity2 is much more interested in painting a picture of @entity4 as a city that never sleeps			1
there ought to be a picture of him in the dictionary next to the word " positive			0
" he 's no one 's victim			2
and that 's probably one reason that the @entity112 has referred to him as " the @entity114 politician			2
" for the most part i admire that about him , but i also understand why non-hispanics fancy the idea that a prominent @entity120 official is n't peddling victimhood			2
it 's because many of them must realize that , these days , hispanics are being victimized			2
if our leaders start beating that drum , there 's no telling what could happen			2
at first , when we sat down , @entity2 resisted saying anything about the controversy over the sleeping @entity57			1
" i certainly understand the hurt feelings , " he said			0
" because it speaks to the negative perception of the @entity33 community as lazy and unambitious that has hampered it through the years			1
but , at the same time , we have a majority - @entity33 city that was just ranked as the top - performing city last year , we have more and more college graduates every day reaching their dreams , so i 'm going to spend my time on the positive			1
" that positive includes the @entity144 's 2011 ranking of @entity4 as no. 1 out of 200 metropolitan areas in terms of performance , in terms of " creating and sustaining jobs and economic growth			1
" and plans for a $ 150 million performance arts there center are off the ground			0
there is a $ 600 million bond measure coming before voters			0
and the city 's unemployment rate is 6.9 % -- compared with the statewide rate of 7.3 % and the national figure of 8.3 %			0
still , i could n't get the sleeping @entity57 off my mind			1
i asked @entity2 if these recurring racial battles are important or merely a distraction ? " in some people 's minds , the community is still limited to that perception , " he said			1
" to the degree that addressing it helps us heal , then it 's important			0
" he added : " what 's interesting about this issue is that they wanted to preserve something that historically had been there			0
... it 's historic preservation vs. cultural sensitivity			2
if you go full historical preservation , you 're going to do it warts and all			0
you have to balance it			0
more than anything , you just feel unfortunate that you 're in the pit to begin with			0
" so i said , " you 're like , ' i do n't want to feed this controversy			0
... ' " @entity2 interrupted : " but i understand it			2
i agree that i do n't like that image			0
i understand how it makes people feel , especially for the older generation			0
it 's a sense of , ' oh man , here we go again			0
' when there is a perceived slight , they 're more attuned it			0
" to hear him describe it , the proposed re-creation depicts a sleeping @entity57 all right , but not as the centerpiece of the marquee			1
it 's just off to the side			0
the more i think about it , the more i decide this whole controversy is a whole lot of nothing			0
so , i ask , why is there a problem ? " it 's symbolic , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's symbolic of how the @entity33 community has been perceived			1
there 's a frustration there that we have n't moved beyond that			0
but i will also say that it 's frustrating because we do n't see @entity232 projected in the media positively			0
so you feel like : ' well , if you had all this great press and people who have become astronauts and done other great things regularly in the news ... then there would n't be a problem			0
' if there was a balance , i do n't think it would strike people so negatively and we could move on			0
" this is a wake - up call			0
let 's put to rest the protests over this image			2
it 's offensive , but it does n't sting			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254			2

@entity254 : @entity4 mayor among most prominent @entity33 officals
he says @entity2 struggles with controversy over planned mural showing sleeping @entity57
@entity254 says @entity2 sees mural image as historic , not currently *resonant*
@entity254 : image is offensive , but it 's time to let this one go in today 's booming @entity4
