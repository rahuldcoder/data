@entity0 -- electric shock guns , spiked metal batons and leg and neck shackles			0
these are some of the torture devices being made and exported by @entity10 companies , fueling human rights abuses in @entity12 and @entity13 , according to a new report from campaign group @entity15			1
the report says that trade in what it calls tools of torture is flourishing , with 130 @entity10 companies engaged in the production and trade of potentially dangerous law enforcement equipment , compared with 28 companies a decade ago			1
most of the companies highlighted in the report are state owned , the report said , and openly promote their products at international trade shows and online			0
while some of the equipment such as tear gas , handcuffs and plastic bullets has legitimate policing uses , @entity15 says many of the devices marketed by these companies are intrinsically cruel and inhumane and should be banned immediately			1
@entity10 officials questioned the report 's credibility			0
" i think you should not ask this question to the foreign ministry			0
we have no knowledge of it , " foreign ministry spokeswoman @entity49 told reporters tuesday			0
" but i would like to remind you that the organization you mentioned has always had strong bias against @entity10			0
so i think it 's questionable about whether the report is real			0
" " @entity10 authorities have done nothing to stop companies supplying these sickening devices for export or to prevent policing equipment falling into the hands of known human rights abusers , " said @entity60 , security trade and human rights researcher at @entity15			1
the report , co-authored with the @entity72 calls on @entity10 to immediately ban the production and trade of inherently cruel and abusive equipment			1
it also urged @entity77 to suspend or deny trade license for the supply of equipment when there is a substantial risk that the equipment will be used to commit or facilitate serious human rights abuses			1
@entity15 said the global trade in law enforcement equipment is poorly controlled and @entity10 is not alone in its failure to regulate the supply of law enforcement equipment to countries where there is a clear risk that it will be misused			1
it added that all countries should heed the report 's recommendations			0
as many as 29 @entity10 companies make electric stun batons that allow security officials to apply painful multiple shocks to sensitive areas of the body such as the groin without leaving long - lasting physical traces			1
a greater number of companies make restraint devices such as weighted leg cuffs			0
spiked batons have been exported to security forces in @entity111 and @entity112 and have been reportedly used by police in @entity114 , while @entity10 made electric shock batons are being carried by police in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , the report said			2
another example highlighted shows how @entity10 - made riot control equipment was used to suppress protests against the rising cost of living in @entity126 , killing at least 33			2
" @entity10 's flawed export system has allowed the trade in torture and repression to prosper , " @entity60 said			2
the report also documents how electric shock batons , mechanical restraints and other devices are widely used in detention centers throughout @entity10			2
one practitioner of banned @entity138 spiritual movement told @entity15 how she was tortured with an electric baton on her face : " it 's a kind of torture the police call ' bengbao popcorn ' because your face splits open and looks like popped corn			2

trade in torture devices by @entity10 companies flourishing , says @entity15
exports of police equipment are fueling human rights abuses in @entity12 and @entity13 , it says .
much of the equipment is " inherently cruel " and should be banned .
some equipment has legitimate uses but can still be misused , it adds .
