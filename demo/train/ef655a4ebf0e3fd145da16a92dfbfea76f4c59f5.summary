when @entity1 tells people to " bow down , " they listen			1
now the star is hoping to bring the same show - stopping power to the issue of gender inequality with an essay on @entity9 's website , the @entity10			1
in " the @entity10 : a woman 's nation pushes back from the @entity15 , " the 32 - year - old pop star -- writing under her full name , @entity1 -- proclaims that " gender equality is a myth ! " the " average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes			1
but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable , things will not change			1
" @entity29 , she continues , " requires both men and women , and we are equally important and need one another			1
... we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect , so that as they grow up , gender equality becomes a natural way of life			1
and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible			0
" her words are likely familiar to those who know her music , which references the trials of womanhood and female empowerment going all the way back to her work with @entity50			2
that 's not to imply that @entity1 's pop music message does n't have its conflicts			1
in the 1999 @entity50 song , " @entity59 , " the lyrics scold a lover who 's gone from footing the bill to asking for money			2
" silly me , why have n't i found another , " the song continues			0
" can you pay my bills ? ... if you did then maybe we could chill			0
" on the other hand , there are @entity50 anthems like " @entity69 , " @entity70 , with lyrics such as " i buy my own diamonds and i buy my own rings			0
... try to control me , boy you get dismissed , " which became a nightclub rallying cry			0
given her prominence and success , her statements on womanhood and feminism are often a source of public debate			0
last april , @entity1 told @entity86 that she hesitated to call herself a feminist			1
( @entity88 similarly ducked the designation while accepting 2012 's @entity91 award , during which she said she 's " not a feminist , " but does " believe in the strength of women			2
" ) the word feminist " can be very extreme , " she told @entity86			0
" but i guess i am a modern - day feminist			0
i do believe in equality			2
why do you have to choose what type of woman you are ? why do you have to label yourself anything ? i 'm just a woman and i love being a woman			0
" a woman , for the record , who celebrates the power of women -- that much is clear from her two most recent albums alone			0
on her 2011 disc " 4 " there was the self - assured " @entity111 ? , " in which she praises the power of women : " my persuasion / can build a nation ...			0
( we 're ) smart enough to make these millions / strong enough to bear the children / then get back to business			0
" and her chart - topping surprise 2013 release , the self - titled " @entity1 , " has been endlessly debated as a symbol of her feminist perspective -- or lack thereof			2
in the song " * * * @entity122 " from that album @entity1 samples words from celebrated writer @entity125 's april 2013 @entity128 " we should all be feminists			1
" " because i am female , i am expected to aspire to marriage , " @entity125 says in the sample			0
" marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support , but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage , and we do n't teach boys the same ? " in her piece for @entity141 , @entity1 echoes @entity125 's perspective , saying " these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning			1
... men have to demand that their wives , daughters , mothers , and sisters earn more -- commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender			2
equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect			1
" the singer 's contribution is one of many pieces that fill @entity9 's report , which explores the rates of financial insecurity among @entity164 women , examines its impact , and offers solutions for change			1
along with @entity1 , @entity9 's report pulled in actress @entity168 , who wrote a piece entitled " @entity170 , " and basketball star @entity171 , who penned an appreciation of the nation 's working mothers			1
the report , which is in partnership with the @entity177 , can be downloaded for free here .			0
