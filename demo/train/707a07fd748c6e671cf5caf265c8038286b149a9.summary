when religion is used , or misused , as a violent tool against the innocent , then it is the user not the tool that is the source of violence			0
the mere idea of traumatizing a human soul violates all values on @entity8			1
whether based on religious texts or human interpretations , no value in the history of mankind justifies any brutal act against any of @entity16 's creation			1
abducting school girls in @entity18 by the so - called " @entity19 " is an act of torture and terrorism against innocent souls			1
in @entity26 , as in other religions , traumatizing children is considered an act of evil			1
it does not differ from " @entity30 " ( burying girls alive ) which is " haram " ( @entity30 ) in the @entity32 : " and when the girl [ who was ] buried alive is asked , for what sin she was killed ? " ( @entity32 , 81:8 and 81:9 )			0
the problem with @entity19 and their likes is that they go against all human norms			1
they want to impose their image of the " @entity16 " on the other images of " @entity42 " which is a natural development of the interaction between humanity and the sacred			1
this " @entity42 " does not fit their frame of authority			0
the mentality by which they run their lives and approaches toward their surroundings is a mentality of a superior @entity16			2
this entails a different and old interpretation of @entity16			2
in @entity32 , each @entity56 ( except one ) starts with @entity57			0
any action by humans should start by " @entity57			0
" starting our deeds by " in the name of @entity16 , the @entity67 , the @entity68 " is a recognition of the basic human attitudes towards everything in life			1
@entity69 and @entity70 are the building blocks of life on @entity8			0
the actions of @entity19 are against @entity73			2
in a deeper level of understanding these actions , one must say that these groups subscribe to a distorted image of @entity16 and of themselves			1
" domination , " " totalitarianism , " " the monopoly of truth " and " @entity16 's representatives on earth " are all expired concepts which belong to an old era of interactivity between @entity81			2
going back to such era emphasizes that those who subscribe to these concepts are working to activate the images they need to serve their interests			0
in @entity26 , worshipping @entity16 is connected to peace , whether peace of mind or body			1
the @entity32 says : " let them worship the lord of this @entity99 ( @entity100 ) , who has fed them , [ saving them ] from hunger and made them safe , [ saving them ] from fear			0
" ( @entity32 , 106:3 and 106:4 ) for me , as a @entity107 who belongs to a rich culture of @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity26 traditions , terrorizing human souls is an act against @entity16			1
abusing the image and the meaning of a merciful " @entity118 " is against @entity26 , especially when it is used by those who claim that they are related to @entity26 , one way or another			1
i am always shocked when simple and basic religious and human principles are given wrong interpretations in order to get some gains of power			2
the real meaning of power in @entity26 is mercy and love			1
in the @entity133 , @entity132 says : " all things of a @entity107 are inviolable ( @entity19 ) for his brother - in - faith : his blood , his property and his honor			2
" it is very strange in our 21st century , that a mental activity ( reading books ) can be considered @entity144 ( @entity30 ) while traumatizing and terrorizing children and people is not			1
the challenge for @entity107 though , is how to really convince the world that @entity26 is a loving , peaceful religion ; muslims should revisit the collective identity they are communicating to others			2
a first step towards this end is to convey these meanings through active expressions of identity			0
@entity159 words are not enough			0
actions are a must if we want the world to really understand the essence of @entity26			0
i am not saying that @entity107 are the only people to blame for this global misunderstanding			0
but it is their duty to deliver the real message of @entity26 to world contexts using proper and practical tools			1
it is also the duty of non-muslims to understand the overall situation before rushing to judge			0
perhaps what helps in this regard is a self - recognition by @entity107 authorities that there is an identity crisis that must be addressed			0
revisiting the basic approaches towards modern life , by actions not words , constitutes a fundamental step towards achieving this goal .			0
