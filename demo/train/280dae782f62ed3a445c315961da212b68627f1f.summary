-- a new study dispels the widely accepted theory that the komodo dragon kills by infecting its prey with toxic bacteria			1
researchers say the @entity8 dragon has venom that keeps blood from clotting around its prey 's wounds			1
instead , the world 's largest lizard delivers a powerful bite with its serrated teeth and uses a powerful venom to bring down its victims			1
komodo dragons are native to the islands of @entity22			0
they can weigh more than 220 pounds ( 100 kilograms ) and grow up to 10 feet ( 3 meters ) in length			0
but their bites are not as strong as that of a crocodile , for example			2
and they can not hold down their prey			2
so , researchers wondered , what lay behind the dragons ' hunting success ? until now , scientists thought the dragons infected their prey with bacteria that lurked in the bits of meat stuck between their teeth			1
the explanation made sense , because many victims would not immediately fall			0
they 'd wander off and collapse later , allowing the dragon to feast on the corpse at leisure			2
the new study upends that theory			2
it was conducted by a team of scientists led by dr. @entity54 from the @entity55 in @entity56			1
according to their research , the dragon 's bite weakens and immobilizes the prey			1
it then injects venom from special glands in the mouth			1
the venom keeps blood from clotting around the prey 's wound			1
and it causes a drop in the blood pressure			0
the blood loss and the blood pressure drop combine to weaken the animal			2
the theory is consistent with what happens to the prey soon after it 's bitten , the scientists said			1
the prey becomes still and unusually quiet , and it bleeds profusely			0
" the combination of this specialized bite and venom seem to minimize the dragon 's contact with its prey , and this allows it to take large animals , " @entity54 said in a statement released by the @entity55			1
komodo attacks on humans are rare , but some have been reported			0
in march , an @entity22 fisherman was killed when he trespassed on a remote island in search of fruit			0
a month earlier , a ranger in the same park survived after a @entity8 dragon climbed the ladder into his hut and bit his hand and foot			0
and in 2007 , an 8 - year - old boy died after being mauled			0
the latest findings will be published in the next issue of the journal @entity108 .			0

scientists had thought lizards infected prey with bacteria from meat between teeth
new study from team led by @entity56 *university* scientist *challenges* that theory
@entity123 's powerful bite , venom from glands in mouth cause prey to weaken , they say
they say the theory is consistent with what happens to prey soon after dragon bites it
