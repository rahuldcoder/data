-- earlier this month , @entity1 celebrated its 40th anniversary			1
the @entity3 opened its doors to the public for the first time on october 1 , 1971 , and not only did the landscape of @entity10 change , the landscape of the family vacation did as well			0
many non-disneyphiles had no clue about the milestone			0
there was n't a big marketing push or makeover of the iconic @entity17 as there was for the 25th anniversary in 1996 , a celebration that lasted more than a year			1
for the anniversary this year , all the " @entity27 " did was hold a special parade and a brief ceremony , along with a tweak to the nightly " wishes " fireworks display			1
guests who came to the park that day also received a commemorative pin			2
the lack of hype for the anniversary can be tied to a recent change made by @entity36 executives , says @entity37 , who just edited a book of essays on the @entity3 's 40 years in business , titled " four decades of @entity41			1
" @entity36 is cutting costs by streamlining operations at its domestic parks , located in @entity45 , @entity46 , and @entity47			1
several industry experts , however , are questioning @entity36 's newest plan of not only streamlining the behind - the - scenes aspects of its domestic parks , like human resources , but also the entire @entity36 experience -- down to attractions and merchandise			1
@entity57 , co-host of the theme park - focused podcast " @entity63 " and managing director for @entity62 studios , said @entity36 fans wanted the hoopla of a 40th anniversary bash			1
" frankly , the fans would love for them to celebrate the 40th			2
the fans of @entity1 understand the impact that @entity1 has made not only on the @entity72 , as a destination park for the @entity72 , but the world as well , " he said			1
@entity37 believes @entity36 is taking the wrong path when it comes to its latest plan			1
" that synthesizing and making a generic @entity36 park experience for merchandise , for attractions , for food and beverage for these other guest interaction pieces has been one of the most unfortunate decisions that the parks and resorts division has ever made , " @entity37 said			1
@entity36 spokesman @entity89 said marketing this year does incorporate all parks			1
" our focus during this ' let the @entity94 ' year in @entity36 parks remains on our guests and the memories they have made , are making and will make in our parks , " he said			1
the @entity10 parks of course remain a popular destination for families like the @entity103 , from @entity104			0
@entity105 and @entity106 opted to take their two girls to @entity1 for the very first time this summer , and it was a hit			2
" there 's a first time for everything , and that first time was great ! and i want to ( go ) again when i 'm older , or in a couple of months because it was really ... enjoyable and i had a great time , " said 8 - year - old @entity115			2
that 's despite the @entity10 summer heat			2
@entity115 's mother , @entity121 , said she was prepared not to have a good time and was making the sacrifice for her children			2
" we were going in july			0
i set my mind that i know it 's fun , i had a blast when i was little , but i 'm an adult now and it may not be as fun			0
i 'm going to wait in lines , it 's going to be hot , i 'm going to be thirsty , " @entity106 said			0
" you know , it was amazing , all that did n't even bother me			0
it was like , you know , i was just their age again			0
i loved it just as much			0
" @entity142 was focused on the finances of bringing his family to @entity1 , but enjoyed the trip			2
" we saved up for it			0
we spent every penny that we saved			0
we 're still trying to recover			0
but i would go again in a heartbeat			0
i would have to save up again ... but i think it was definitely worth it			0
it was a great family memory , " he said			0
according to @entity37 , other families might not opt to go to @entity1 , but would just look for a " @entity36 experience " elsewhere -- and that should have the @entity157 concerned			1
" if i was the @entity159 , i would be a little bit concerned about this strategy , because it 's basically telling guests go to a @entity36 park , it does n't matter which one , " @entity37 said .			1

@entity1 marks 40th anniversary with little hype
in contrast , celebrations of the park 's 25th *birthday* lasted more than a year
*observers* say the *company* is focusing on " making a generic @entity36 park experience "
