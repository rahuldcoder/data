@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , now an internet giant , is learning that it needs to take more careful steps in regards to privacy			1
prompted by intensifying scrutiny from government regulators and privacy watchdogs , @entity3 is striving to be more sensitive to data - collection issues that often make people uneasy			1
it went so far as to spike a recent project @entity3 engineers had developed because of fears of potential backlash , said @entity18 , @entity3 's executive chairman and former ceo			1
the scrapped software would have let people include their head shot photos in a database so that they could be recognized by a mobile application when someone takes a picture of their faces			0
" we built that technology , and we withheld it , " @entity18 said in an onstage interview at the @entity30 : @entity33 conference here on tuesday			0
" as far as i know , it was the only technology that @entity3 built , and we decided to stop			1
" that product was meant to be part of an app called @entity40 , which is able to look at a picture taken from a phone and then translate text or recognize a building , advertisement or painting			2
( facial recognition is , however , being used to power a feature in @entity50 's @entity49 that blurs the faces of bystanders caught on camera			1
) as recently as march , @entity3 still had plans to eventually release the facial - recognition version of the app , @entity2 reported			1
@entity18 was less supportive of the idea at a conference two weeks ago when he said it was " unlikely " that @entity3 would release the software			1
with facial - recognition technology , " an evil dictator could use that against you , " @entity18 said on tuesday			1
" we 're so sensitive on the privacy issue now			0
" since @entity18 handed over the ceo reigns to co-founder @entity68 in april , the goal was to create an organization that operates more autonomously , that works like a startup , @entity3 managers say			1
but to address privacy issues , @entity3 has inserted a layer of oversight to reduce the recklessness that many fledgling companies get away with			1
" historically , we would just throw stuff over the wall , " @entity18 said			0
" we now have a very , very thorough process			0
" company lawyers and government - policy specialists now work with the development teams as they 're building products and brainstorming ideas , @entity18 said			1
it 's their job to wrangle expectations and ensure @entity3 does n't overstep " the creepy line " ( to borrow a phrase from @entity18 )			1
regulators say @entity3 has crossed that line before , with its camera - taking vehicles and with @entity90			2
the latter attracted the ire of the @entity94 government when the service published the e-mail contact lists for users			0
as a result , @entity3 agreed to submit to reviews of its privacy policies as part of a @entity103 settlement			1
@entity18 , an industry veteran , knows that a series of stumbles can scar a tech company			0
he said at the conference that software giant @entity108 is no longer a top player among tech brands			0
" @entity108 is not driving the consumer revolution in the mind of consumers , " @entity18 said			0
( however , it 's worth noting that in an interview with the @entity116 last year , @entity18 named @entity108 , with its @entity118 search engine , as @entity3 's biggest competitor , ahead of @entity120 and @entity121			2
) @entity18 's big four is @entity123 , @entity120 , @entity121 and ( you guessed it ) @entity3			2
@entity125 mentions go to @entity126 and @entity127			0
coincidentally , the latter is suing @entity3 over its new mobile - payments service , called @entity130 , which launches in @entity131 on wednesday and was demonstrated at the event			2
@entity120 , which @entity3 competes with on smartphones and soon laptops , was a recipient of much praise from @entity18			2
he said @entity120 makes " beautiful products " and has just renewed a deal to use @entity3 's search and maps services			1
he suggested people buy @entity143 computers over @entity108 's @entity144 if they 're concerned about getting viruses -- " speaking as a proud former board member of @entity120 , " he said			0
besides including @entity121 in his list of top companies , @entity18 had little else to laud the social network for			0
the site is about connecting with " every friend you 've ever had , including the ones you ca n't quite remember , " he said			0
@entity3 has tried to partner with @entity121 , but @entity108 usually wins those deals , he said			2
@entity121 , too , has had to walk a privacy tightrope when rolling out new features			0
responding to a question about @entity121 's growing presence , @entity18 said : " i think the industry would benefit from having an alternative			0

@entity3 has appointed lawyers to work with developers on new products
for the first time , @entity3 canned a finished project *due* to privacy concerns
the product would have used facial recognition to find out who someone is
