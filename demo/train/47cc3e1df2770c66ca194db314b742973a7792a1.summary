the media mogul and former talk - shown queen has been gushing for weeks about @entity4 's new surface tablet , which she compared to a @entity5 and named one of her " @entity7 " of 2012			1
on sunday , she went a step further , sending a @entity10 message to her 14.8 million followers saying " love that surface ! " and adding that she 'd already bought 12 of the devices for @entity14 gifts			1
there 's only one problem			0
@entity18 -- or whoever manages her @entity10 account -- sent the tweet from an @entity22			1
the people of the @entity24 , who never miss the opportunity to poke fun at an online gaffe , took notice			2
" she does have legions of fans , making her an effective marketing channel for @entity4			0
except for when the narrative around her promotion is tossed on its head by a foolish , and utterly avoidable mistake , " wrote @entity34 on tech - news site @entity36			0
" surface ads , now brought to you by @entity22			1
" tweeted @entity45 's @entity44 : " ok , this made me laugh out loud			0
" @entity48 tablet goes on sale for $ 499 but other observers said people should n't read too much into @entity18 's tweet			1
" the tweet being sent from an @entity22 does n't necessarily mean @entity0 prefers the @entity22 over the @entity48 ; just because you bought a @entity57 does n't mean you 'll never use a @entity59 or @entity4 console ever again , " wrote @entity53 at @entity54			1
besides , some bloggers have noted that no official @entity10 app exists yet for @entity62 , the new operating system on the @entity48 , although @entity10 says it 's building one			2
so maybe there 's room in @entity0 's heart for two tablets ? @entity69 fans may remember the original @entity22 made @entity0 's " @entity70 " list back in 2010			2
" words can not describe what i feel for this magnificent device , " she said at the time			0
" i really think it 's the best invention of the century so far			0
" at least , until the @entity48 came along .			0

@entity18 endorses the new surface tablet in a gushy tweet -- sent from an @entity22
*amused* tech bloggers call the @entity10 message a marketing gaffe
others say it does n't necessarily mean she does n't use both tablets
