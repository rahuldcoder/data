when police caught up with alleged killer @entity2 last weekend , the 25 - year - old ex-marine was crying , shirtless , shoeless and smelling of alcohol			1
" i 'm hurting , " he told them			2
not long before , at a @entity8 shooting range , police say , @entity2 had gunned down @entity9 , the @entity10 who called himself @entity13 's deadliest military sniper			2
as he sits in a @entity8 jail cell , details about @entity2 's psychological make - up have surfaced , including claims that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder , a condition that affects a number of current and former members of the @entity13 military			1
of course , combat duty does n't automatically lead to ptsd			1
and it 's not even clear that @entity2 served in a combat zone during his four years in the @entity27			2
nonetheless , @entity9 's tragic death and @entity2 's story are shining light on those who suffer from ptsd and the circumstances that surround it			1
here are five things to know about @entity24 : what is it ? anyone who has experienced a life - threatening situation can develop @entity24 , according to dr. @entity39 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity41			1
a sufferer typically re-experiences the trauma through flashbacks and nightmares , experiences that can seem as real as the actual trauma			1
the person often feels intensely that the trauma could happen again at any time			1
how common is it for someone to be diagnosed with @entity24 ? while many people will have extremely distressing or threatening experiences in their lifetimes , only a small percentage will experience @entity24 , experts say			1
in the general population about 7 % of people experience @entity24 , and there is a 60 % chance of at - risk individuals -- combat veterans , victims of natural disasters or victims of violent crime -- experiencing @entity24 , experts estimate			1
thirty percent of service members who have fought in @entity68 or @entity69 have been diagnosed with @entity24 , according to a @entity71 study released last year			1
" we need to remember that while substantial numbers of vets have mental health conditions , " @entity39 said , the majority do not			2
" we do n't want to stigmatize our vets , because many of them are not ill , " he said			0
" as an organization and as a community , the military has varying levels of health and risk			0
there are more services for mental health care in the military than there has ever been before			0
" how virtual reality can combat veterans ' ptsd could @entity24 lead someone to act violently ? there 's no way to answer that definitively , experts say			1
but new research is being conducted			0
@entity68 and @entity69 veterans who struggle with anger are twice as likely as other vets to be arrested for crimes , according to the @entity103 , which published a study last year			0
the study , conducted by the @entity106 , examined 1,388 combat veterans			0
researchers found that about 23 % of those with ptsd and high irritability had been arrested for criminal offenses			1
but researchers also found that other factors unrelated to military service -- including growing up around violence or drug abuse -- were factors behind why some vets committed crimes			0
is there a way to treat ptsd that reduces the chances that a sufferer will act out ? exposure therapy often helps the person with @entity24 revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them , said dr. @entity130 , a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating ptsd			1
@entity130 , who is with the @entity134 at the @entity135			0
this kind of therapy has been around for years			0
typically a therapist would ask someone to imagine they are experiencing their trauma again			2
this would happen repeatedly , and ideally , with each retelling of what happened , the event would seem gradually less threatening			0
recently @entity130 and other experts have employed virtual reality for this purpose			1
patients wear goggles and describe their experiences while a technician stands by with a console changing the scene to fit the patient 's description			0
if the patient recalls hearing a young boy 's voice , the technician makes that happen			0
if the patient experienced the trauma at night or in the daytime , or perhaps was involved in an @entity165 explosion , those circumstances will be created in the virtual world			1
" we can begin to pace the exposure in a very evocative fashion , " @entity130 said			0
" this works because some people do n't engage in the trauma memory at a sufficient level			2
they do n't engage fully with their imagination to confront difficult memories			0
" treating ptsd with @entity176 : one story could a gun range be a form of exposure therapy ? absolutely not , @entity130 said			2
" what happened this weekend with the death of former @entity10 sniper @entity9 at a gun range is exactly the opposite of the evidence - based approach to treating @entity24 , " termed ' prolonged exposure ' or ' virtual reality exposure ' therapy , he said			1
" @entity9 , while well trained in his field , had no clinical training in conducting therapeutic exposure			0
" it is never advisable to put someone with ptsd in an environment where there is likely to be uncontrolled exposure to provocative events -- such as gunfire and visuals of people shooting guns -- because this could stoke a flashback in the @entity24 sufferer			1
" this would especially not be recommended in a situation where that person had a gun in his / her hand or at least quick access to one			0
that would truly be a questionable activity , and in this case , it was a deadly one , " @entity130 wrote in an e-mail forum to journalists who were asking him about the @entity9 case			0
conducting exposure therapy requires a well - trained expert clinician in a very controlled therapeutic setting , @entity130 said			2
" that is very different than what one could ever reasonably expect in the atmosphere of a shooting range , " he said .			0

@entity24 is marked by hyper - *vigilance* , a fear that a trauma will occur again
rates of @entity24 among the general population are low
virtual reality is being used to treat ptsd sufferers
