@entity1 authorities are looking at a video that purportedly shows @entity4 delivering a sermon in @entity6 to determine whether it is really the notorious leader of the @entity8 , @entity1 's military spokesman said sunday			1
the video surfaced on social media sites tied to @entity8 , the terror group that now calls itself the @entity10			1
it shows a man identified as @entity13 conducting friday prayers at the @entity15			1
" the video is being analyzed and cross-referenced with intelligence data to determine whether it is in fact @entity4 , " said @entity16 , the military spokesman			0
the @entity21 government is also examining the video			0
if it is @entity13 , it would be one of the first known appearances of the elusive extremist militant leader to be captured on video			2
very few images have been made public of @entity13			0
@entity8 fighters took control of @entity6 , @entity1 's second largest city , in early june following a quick campaign that saw @entity1 security forces quickly fold under their assault			2
the release of the video comes days after unconfirmed reports surfaced that the militant leader had either been killed or wounded in airstrikes in @entity1 's western @entity40 province or in the @entity6 area			1
the timing of the video also appears to coincide with a declaration by @entity8 last week of the creation of an @entity8 state that stretches from the northeast city of @entity47 in @entity48 to @entity1 's @entity39			1
as part of that declaration , an @entity8 spokesman said the group would now be known as the @entity10 , and @entity13 as its leader would be known as @entity54 -- a reference to the leading religious figure considered a successor to the @entity58			2
the video , which was released by the media arm of @entity8 , identified the man as @entity54			1
@entity61 can not independently verify the authenticity of the video , which shows dozens of people , including men who appear to be bodyguards , listening to the sermon and praying			0
several automatic weapons are displayed near the man delivering the sermon			0
in the video , the man purported to be @entity13 urges people to follow his call to create an @entity8 state in @entity1 and @entity48 and wage jihad , or holy war , during @entity75 -- the holy month of fasting for @entity76 that began at the end of june			1
" it is a month from @entity83 when we are protected from hell , and this is every night -- nights during which the marketplace of jihad is open , " he said , according to a translation of the video posted by @entity80 , which monitors terror groups			0
very little is known about @entity13 , a name he appears to have adopted just before taking the reins of @entity93 in @entity1 , a group that later reformed under the banner of @entity8			1
a biography posted on militant websites last year said he earned a doctorate in @entity8 studies from the @entity100			0
a man named @entity102 was detained for four years in @entity103 , which was a @entity21 - run prison in southern @entity1			2
he was released in 2009			0
@entity61 can not confirm whether it is the same man			0
@entity105 hints at another try for @entity1 pm group : @entity8 takes major @entity48 oil field @entity110 chairman wo n't rule out more @entity21 military			2
