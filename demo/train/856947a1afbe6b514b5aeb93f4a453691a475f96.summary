he faces potential prosecution and in trying to negotiate a plea bargain he appears to be willing to falsely accuse me of wrongdoing			0
" in regard to @entity88 's allegations , he wrote : " i have no idea why he would say the things he is alleged to have said			2
to be clear , i have never approached @entity88 , or anyone else , about match - fixing or any other improper activity			1

' " she claimed her ex-husband had once called her in tears , saying he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars after his attempts to fix had gone wrong , @entity168 reported			0
@entity190 - white ? @entity4 regularly ranks as one of the world 's least corrupt countries , recently topping @entity195 's @entity194 alongside @entity196			2
@entity4 sportswriter @entity197 said the allegations of corruption surrounding celebrated athletes in the country 's summer game had come as a shock to many			2
" @entity204 , perhaps unrealistically , think of themselves as fairly lily - white in terms of match - fixing and banned drugs in sport , " he told @entity169			1
" it 's always a huge shock when someone 's done -- although when you catalog it all , we can mix it with the best of them on the wrong side of the line			0
" @entity220 cricket writer @entity219 said @entity4 players may have been targeted for approaches as the country had had the highest number of defectors to the " rebel " @entity54 competition , and were " comparatively speaking poorly paid by international standards			1
" " i guess they were the first targets of @entity54 recruiting agents and therefore became exposed to a tournament where really nothing hinged on the outcome and the amounts being paid were far more than the individual players were worth , " he told @entity169			0
" nothing is more conducive to corruption than meaningless cricket , and sums of money that are odds with the scale and importance of the game			0

@entity219 said the game 's administrators had failed to keep pace with developments in the south @entity271 gambling market			0
" under the present climate where vast quantities ( of money ) have entered the game over the past 10 years and the game is still trying to operate under institutional structures that were devised during the 20th century , i think cricket 's got a lot of catching up to do , " he said			2
he was n't confident that administrators would tackle the problem anytime soon			0
" frankly , they simply have n't been focused on this			0
they 've been too busy attempting to make money themselves , " @entity219 said			0
" it took a very , very long time for cycling to take seriously the issue of doping			0
it 's amazing how long administrators can stave off doing anything serious			0
" he said if a broadcaster or major sponsor took a stance on corruption in the game , it could help efforts to driver out fixers			0
until then , fans would be left wondering every time they saw something out of the ordinary on the pitch			0
