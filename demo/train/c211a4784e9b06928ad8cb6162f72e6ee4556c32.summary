-- maybe there 's something in the snow up in @entity4			1
that hearty @entity6 state consistently has the highest rate of voter participation in the country			1
in 2008 , 78 % of eligible people voted in the presidential election , according to an analysis from @entity13			0
that number masks an amazing fact : some districts of @entity4 turn out more than 90 % of the eligible population , according to @entity4 secretary of state @entity18			1
none of that seems out of the ordinary to @entity18 , whose office handles elections			0
in fact , he says the state should do more -- that statewide voter participation should be as near to 100 % as possible			1
change the @entity27 : where does your state rank ? " we 're happy			2
we stand up and shout , " he told me by phone , referring to the state 's top rank in voting			1
" but an average means there 's some above and some below ( the average )			2
like every place , our young adults vote in a lower percentage than older adults			0
and we 've discovered that 's because there are more barriers for them , and we 're working to tear down those barriers			2
" the state already has torn down plenty			2
i 'm looking to @entity4 for solutions to low voter participation in other states			1
i recently visited @entity56 because the @entity56 had the absolute lowest rate of participation in the 2008 election			2
less than half of eligible people voted			0
as the @entity63 ' election expert @entity62 told me , what works for one state may not work for another			2
still , it makes sense to at least consider a few things @entity4 is doing right			1
" i do think it 's worthwhile for the states to experiment , " @entity62 said			2
with that caveat in mind , here are five factors that likely contribute to @entity4 's status as a voting paradise			1
take a look and let me know what you think in the comments section below			0
same - day voter registration : americans who want to vote should be able to decide that on @entity85			1
that 's true in @entity4 , where you can walk into your polling place , register and cast a ballot -- all at the same time			1
it 's not true in many states , where voter registration closes days or weeks before @entity85			1
research shows that states with same - day registration have turnout rates 5 % to 7 % higher than those that do n't , according to @entity99 at @entity13			1
the drawback , some would argue , is an increased risk of voter fraud			0
@entity18 , the @entity4 secretary of state , told me that has n't posed a real threat , and the state has been using the system since the 1970s			1
" imagine you 're registering a voter that 's standing in front of you versus registering someone through a form in the mail			1
which one of those has more integrity ? obviously the person who is standing in front of you			0
" the state checks on election - day registrations against computer databases the next day to catch duplicates , he said			1
civic culture : it 's harder to quantify , but @entity4 's civic - minded culture may play a role in its high turnout			1
about 38 % of @entity132 volunteer , putting it third in the country , according to the federal government			0
@entity18 told me people in @entity4 take pride in their state -- and they see voting as part of their civic duty			1
@entity62 and @entity99 pointed to this factor , too , noting that it could be why the state implements laws designed to encourage high rates of voter participation			2
" @entity132 take pride in the fact that they are always in the top in turnout , " @entity62 said			0
raising awareness : the fact that people see voting as part of their civic duty may be no accident			0
@entity4 has programs that encourage young people to volunteer as polling place monitors before they 're eligible to vote			2
schools use voting machines for high school elections -- like those for prom king and queen -- so that kids are familiar with the process			0
the state 's @entity169 of a veteran campaign asks people to wear a sticker that has the name of a loved one who fought for the right to vote in this country			1
@entity18 wears one in honor of his dad , a @entity179 in @entity180 4			0
no voter @entity182 laws : for now , at least , the state has few barriers to voting			2
that could change if a proposed amendment to the state 's constitution passes in november			1
the amendment would require voters who cast ballots in person to present a government photo id or cast a certified provisional ballot			0
one consequence , as @entity18 writes in the @entity194 , is that voters may not be able to register and vote on the same day			0
that could have a negative impact on voter participation			0
the benefits of making it easy for people to register and vote outweigh the risks of fraud			0
a vibrant political scene : close and contentious elections can boost turnout , and @entity4 has had plenty of those in recent years			1
the state is home to polarizing politicians like @entity214 and @entity215			0
additionally , according to @entity18 , it has seven " functioning political parties , " meaning there 's little reason to feel disenfranchised			0
remember governor / wrestler @entity220 ? he ran as a @entity222 candidate -- and won			0
in @entity56 , by comparison , all levels of political life are more or less dominated by the @entity226 , giving some voters the sense their votes do n't matter .			0

@entity4 has the highest voter turnout rate in the country
same - day voter registration *accounts* for some of the state 's lead
the state also has a hearty , civic - minded culture
