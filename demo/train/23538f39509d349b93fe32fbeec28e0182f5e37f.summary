-- i remember when i was 10 or 11 years old , our @entity4 director , @entity3 , displayed school pennants sent to him by former club members who had gone off to college			1
i looked up at all those university names and emblems and thought , " if i work hard and graduate from high school , anything is possible			1
" the staff at our club in @entity16 , @entity17 , insisted that we take our education seriously			1
today 's kids desperately need that same motivation			1
as an alumnus of @entity22 and the organization 's national spokesman for 18 years , i am deeply concerned about the well - being of our nation 's young people			2
with so many serious issues facing @entity29 , we sometimes look past our most basic responsibility as a society : to care for our young			0
as @entity34 states : " train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it			0
" for too many youth in our country today , that " training " is either missing or insufficient			2
my time at the @entity4 made an incredible difference in my life			1
the club gave me the confidence to succeed and to change the course of my life			1
mentors like @entity3 told me i could do anything i wanted to do			0
that sounds like a simple thing , but as a kid i was n't hearing that a lot			0
they gave me the positive support that i needed			0
@entity3 was far more than a staff person			2
he gave me that push that i 'll always credit with making the difference in my life			0
i look back now and think about all the time after school that i spent at the club			1
i started there when i was just 6 and stayed for 12 years			0
many of the boys i grew up with -- friends who did n't take advantage of the opportunities the club offered -- ended up in trouble with the law and spent many years in prison			2
no single snapshot better illustrates the dilemma our country faces than the high school dropout crisis : -- one - third of @entity29 's children do not graduate from high school			1
that percentage jumps to 40 , 50 , even 60 percent in many urban and low - income neighborhoods			2
-- nationally , 1.3 million students in the class of 2010 failed to graduate , giving the @entity29 the dubious distinction of being the only industrialized country where young people are less likely than their parents to obtain a high school diploma			1
the cost to our nation in unrealized potential , and more immediate social ills such as crime , violence , substance abuse and teen pregnancy , is staggering			0
many discussions and debates on the state of education in @entity29 are taking place and these must continue			2
but i firmly believe another piece of the education equation is often overlooked -- specifically the role of youth development and mentorship during those unsupervised hours when kids are n't at school or at home , both during the school year and the summer months			1
we need to reframe the education discussion by adding the out - of - school experience to the equation			1
quality time spent with children during the nonschool hours -- including summer break -- builds character , encourages good health habits and increases academic performance			2
the most profound impact is the eventual outcome -- young people equipped with the attitude , confidence and motivation to finish high school , prepared to succeed beyond			1
@entity125 is making a major commitment to attack the dropout crisis			2
the organization 's graduation strategy -- every member , @entity131 -- aims to ensure that every @entity4 member advances to the next grade level on time each year			1
@entity4 staff members do this by emphasizing the importance of education and high school graduation , recognizing academic successes , and reinforcing those habits and skills needed to be successful in school			1
we can identify young people who are at risk of dropping out and use one - on - one intervention and close collaboration with teachers to help that student develop the academic , emotional and social skills necessary to achieve academic success			1
we have already seen dramatic evidence that an emphasis on academic success , good character and citizenship , and healthy lifestyles works			0
nine out of 10 of our club members graduate from high school or obtain a ged , according to a @entity162 of club alumni			1
nearly two - thirds said that club staff contributed to their success in high school			1
the question people often ask is " what can i do to make a difference ? " my answer is that people can help based on their ability			0
some can give products or services			0
some , like me , can give their time			1
they can offer their unique skills or experience to make an important difference in a child 's life			0
it does n't have to be a huge commitment of time			0
imagine the good we could do if each of us volunteered just an hour or two a week			0
i recently met with president @entity192 and thanked him for supporting our efforts and for continuing to inspire and encourage @entity29 's young people to pursue great futures			0
while the president 's support is significant , all of our efforts will be needed if we are to reverse the falling graduation rate before we lose another generation of students			0
but reverse it we must			0
our country 's future depends on it			0
@entity3 worked for the @entity205 for more than 22 years			0
surely you can give some of your time as well			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity209 credits @entity4 and a director with helping , mentoring him
@entity213 says the staff at the club he attended insisted kids take education seriously
the club helps reduce high dropout rate by mentoring kids in out - of - school time , he writes
one - on - one intervention , he says , and *programs* give youth confidence , motivation
