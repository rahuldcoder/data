-- in april , @entity1 began a personal project to continue practicing her drawing technique , " while saying something worthy			1
" with some paper found in her office in @entity8 , @entity9 , and an old box of colored pencils , the 26 - year - old graphic designer began sketching			1
four months later , her unnamed project 's @entity13 page has attracted more than 83,000 likes , a @entity17 page and an international following			1
the drawings feature images of women and girls with commentary on topics including weight , hair , clothes and sexuality			1
the images take about two hours to create ; the commentary is first written in @entity30 , and volunteers take on the delicate translations in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and other languages			1
" @entity40 was raped , " says an image of a woman clutching her knees			0
" @entity40 , you are not alone			0
it 's not your fault			1
this experience is not what defines you as a human being			0
you are so much more than this			0
" " @entity49 avoided wearing high heels because everybody told her she would be too tall , " one image says			0
" then , @entity49 tried on the @entity53 and has never ever wanted to take them off			0
" " @entity55 is 7 years old			0
her parents found it a bit odd that she chose to take karate instead of ballet , " says one drawing of a girl with a ponytail and in the middle of a high kick			0
" @entity55 , gender conventions should never limit your identity ! you can do whatever you want ! " @entity1 said she had no idea her art project would spur a global response			1
" your art is brilliant , " @entity73 wrote from @entity74 on @entity13			1
" i loved reading your descriptions as well			0
" " i love your work and do n't mind waiting for the translations , " @entity77 commented from the @entity78			0
" i love what you have to say and i think it 's commendable that you are so careful with translations and so sensitive to / aware of using positive language			1
" @entity86 's project is one of several that are reimagining how women are seen , and how they see themselves			1
@entity91 's lean in partnership with @entity93 features a curated selection of photographs to highlight the diversity of women in and outside the office			1
in a recent commercial , @entity99 , the sanitary napkin company , challenged viewers to reconsider the phrase " like a girl			0
" @entity1 hopes to establish an online shop to make the popular illustrations available as prints			1
for now , she said , she 'll continue working with volunteers to translate the illustrations into several languages			1
in an e-mail interview , @entity86 explained more about her images and why they 're reaching an audience around the world			1
her edited answers are below			0
@entity0 : how do these illustrations reflect who you are ? is there an illustration that is personally relevant for you , or that you drew from personal experience ? @entity86 : i think they obviously define how i feel about many things , especially concerning the representation of people			2
most of them were based on people i know , that are close to me			0
for example , my mother who has white hair , and i think it 's gorgeous , but still many people tell her to dye it			2
in the end , i can relate to most of them , because they are all about the control over women 's bodies , and i live that every day			1
whenever i see a newspaper criticizing a woman 's appearance , it 's like saying that every woman in every occasion can and will be evaluated by her looks			2
does n't really matter if she 's receiving a @entity151 or saving people from drowning , papers will talk about her poor choice of shoes or a nip slip			2
@entity0 : how would you describe your illustrations and the response to them ? what has surprised you about the response ? @entity1 : i think the point of my illustrations is to show , in a gentle and nonaggressive way , that there is still a lot of oppressive control over women 's personal choices and identities , and expose a problem of representation toward women , people of color , people with disabilities , ( @entity179 concerns ) and so on			1
i was really surprised with such huge success , the way people shared my illustrations			2
i really was n't expecting that			0
i fight prejudice in so many ways , and that does n't mean i do n't still have some of my own			0
i was surprised to see so many people that i thought would be very conservative sharing my work , and thanking me for doing it			2
sometimes we stumble on our own expectations , and sometimes that 's a good thing			2
@entity0 : are there any posts or illustrations that have had a particularly passionate response from the community ? what was it , and why do you think it struck a nerve ? @entity1 : many people have thanked me for the one about @entity40 being raped , saying that my words somehow helped them through a hard time			1
honestly , there 's nothing as rewarding as that			2
some people told me they finally got the courage to wear high heels after they saw the picture of @entity49			0
that 's really amazing , ( and ) makes me so so happy ! of course , the one about abortion had also some angry comments , but that was expected			2
@entity0 : you deal with a lot of delicate topics			0
how do you choose which topics you illustrate ? how has your approach to the project evolved since you began ? @entity1 : i have some topics i 'd like to discuss on a list , but people are now sending me amazing suggestions from all over the world			1
it 's fantastic , i think i 'll never end this project			1
at first , i was thinking about feminism			0
but now i 'm talking about so many other things , like racism , ableism , homophobia , transphobia			0
... people are happy to feel represented , and i 'm happy that , even in a minor scale , i am being able to do that			0
@entity0 : what has been surprising about this experience ? @entity1 : i guess i was positively shocked by the amount of people who are eager to see a wider representation of the human being			1
many people told me how happy they were to see a person in a wheelchair when the topic in discussion was not the disability			0
and it 's great !			2
