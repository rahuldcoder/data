-- by now , both the rules and deadly consequences of @entity3 -- the online drinking game of one - upmanship that has already resulted in at least five deaths -- have gone viral			1
the game has players sharing videos of themselves downing boozy concoctions , usually mixed with something daringly repulsive , and challenging their friends to top the result			2
in recent weeks , a new version of @entity3 has started to make the rounds , this one inviting people to do an act of good will			1
it has gone under many headers ; some folks have reappropriated @entity3 , others call it @entity23 ( for @entity24 )			1
the charity - driven trend originated in @entity26 , where a handful of people horrified by the drinking game decided to give it a new slant			1
one of those who started the trend was @entity32 , a brand activation specialist who was neknominated by a friend			1
rather than getting drunk , he decided to use his nomination to feed a homeless person			2
" i 'd only viewed two [ @entity3 ] videos			1
one was of a gentleman from @entity40 urinating into a cup			0
he added beer and drank it all down			0
the second was of an aggressive man who bit the head off a chicken -- a baby chicken -- and swallowed it before he drank his beer			2
i could n't understand why people were putting something so ridiculous online , " he recalls			0
" when i was neknominated , i wanted to do something different that could be filtered into my circle of friends			2
if i fed one person , hopefully the people i neknominated would do the same , " he adds			2
he did n't imagine the video would get much traction beyond his circle			2
since posting it on @entity62 last month , @entity32 's video has garnered over 755,000 views			1
he has also attracted an additional 7,000 @entity65 followers			0
he has since used the video as a launchpad for a social media campaign ( # changeonething ) , a weekly radio segment and , perhaps soon , a charity foundation			0
" the foundation will hopefully go live in march			0
it 's kind of a dating site for charities , where they can have a profile and list their needs on a micro level , " he explains			0
so far , thousands have been inspired by his video ( he estimates that he has already received over 100,000 emails from people who have continued what he started )			1
big brands , including @entity85 and @entity86 , have also followed suit			0
" one beautiful story i was sent was from a man in @entity40 who went into a grocery store and bought a bunch of food			0
he saw a homeless man and gave him the food , then asked him to hold the camera while he took off a jacket his father had given to him and gave it to the man , " he recalls			1
the movement has struck a particular chord in @entity26 , where others , oblivious to @entity32 's efforts , have taken a similar stance with @entity106			1
@entity107 , a digital marketing strategist , decided to use the concept to help rebuild his neighbor 's house after a fire incinerated the roof			1
" the fire happened in december , and by january , nothing had been done			0
there were a few funds that had been raised , but not enough to repair the roof , which had burned			0
that 's when the idea came to @entity3 and help her out that way , " he recalls			2
he created a video profiling his neighbor , @entity125 , who also looks after 14 orphaned children in her @entity128 home			1
at the end , he neknominated all of @entity26 to do their part			1
in two days , he 'd raised the required funds -- $ 4,000			0
one of the most touching stories he heard was of a 10 - year old boy who donated the money he was saving to buy a @entity139 set to help @entity125 rebuild her home			2
local store @entity141 was also nominated to chip in , and they responded by donating the tools to get the job done			0
" the reason this works so well in @entity26 is because there 's so much need for this sort of thing , " @entity144 speculates			1
" people here are looking for ways to help out , and the answers are n't always right in front of them			0
this gives them an excuse , and there 's also a sense of urgency about it , because they have to complete the nominations within 24 hours , " he says .			0
