an @entity1 attack against the @entity2 is a question of timing -- " not of inevitably , not of intent , " according to the former head of the @entity6 , retired gen. @entity8 speaking to @entity10 's @entity9 on " @entity11 , " @entity8 said he expects @entity1 to attempt an attack on targets in the @entity14 or @entity15			1
" @entity1 is a very powerful local organization , and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization , " @entity8 said			1
" but it 's one that has global ambitions -- and it has the tools			0
" there 's no clear consensus inside the intelligence community as to whether @entity1 , which calls itself the @entity24 , is currently capable of striking the @entity2			2
that debate came to the forefront last week after the @entity28 militant group beheaded @entity14 journalist @entity29 in retaliation for the airstrikes -- an act that @entity33 , the former deputy director of the @entity6 , called the group 's " first terrorist attack against the @entity14 , " in an interview with @entity37			1
" it 's expressed the intent , " @entity8 said			2
" there 's no way more powerful way to express their street credentials among the jihadist community than a successful attack against the @entity2			1
" the @entity14 military has conducted targeted airstrikes in order to stop @entity1 's progress in the region			1
the @entity53 administration initially said the strikes were carried out in order to protect @entity14 personnel at the consulate in @entity58 , @entity59 , and prevent the genocide of the @entity62 people , a religious minority in the country			2
that mission has appeared to have been broadened -- strikes continued to hit @entity1 targets near @entity58 and the @entity69 on sunday , @entity65 said in a news release			1
the majority of the strikes have been in support of @entity59 forces near the dam , which briefly fell under @entity1 control			0
@entity8 said that @entity14 airstrikes inside @entity78 , in addition to those being conducted in @entity59 , would make a difference in the fight against @entity1			1
airstrikes in @entity59 come at the request of that government ; @entity78 , however , is in the midst of a civil war in which almost 200,000 people have been killed			0
the @entity14 has called for its president , @entity89 , to step down			0
" it 's not just about defense ; it 's not just about keeping the right people off of aircraft , " @entity8 said			0
" it 's about offense			0
it 's about disabling @entity1			0
it 's about making them more worried , more consumed with protecting their own survivability rather than yours or mine			0

former @entity6 chief @entity8 says @entity1 will attempt to attack targets in @entity15 , @entity14
@entity8 says such an attack would express @entity1 ' " street credentials "
