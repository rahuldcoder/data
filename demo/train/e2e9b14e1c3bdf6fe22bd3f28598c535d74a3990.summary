rivalry ? what rivalry ? @entity1 hosts @entity2 and @entity3 , who 've been pitted against each other as rumors fly that @entity6 is mulling a changing of the guard , made light of their situation monday night , by belting a show tune together			1
" tonight , tonight , who 's going to host ' tonight ? ' is it going to be @entity3 or @entity2 ? " the pair sang in a parody of " tonight " from the @entity18 musical " @entity19			1
" the rumor mill has @entity21 , 38 , taking over 62 - year - old @entity2 's job as host of @entity6 's " @entity24 , " and @entity2 has responded with pointed barbs at his employer that have seen his ratings rise			1
" in the news , they say i 'm replacing you , they think that i can woo , the demo , " @entity21 sang			2
@entity2 responsed : " so the network says , here 's an idea : pack your bags , take a hike , @entity6 - ya ! " we 're still friends , right ? the carefully choreographed bit capped a day - long @entity6 promotional blitz that included a 30 - second teaser video on @entity21 's @entity44 channel			1
a beleaguered @entity2 exits the " @entity24 " set in @entity45 at the beginning of the four - minute skit , hounded by reporters asking him if the rumors of his demise are true			1
meanwhile in @entity51 , a pensive - looking @entity21 , surrounded by speculative press clippings in his dressing room , gets a call from @entity2			1
" hey kid , how you holding up ? " " okay , i guess , " @entity21 answers			0
" you ? " " i 'll live			0
i 've been through this before you know , " @entity2 deadpans			1
" i 've got to admit i 'm getting sick of all this			0
" looking for reassurance , @entity21 says : " @entity2 , can i ask you something ? we 're still friends , right ? " @entity2 : " of course we 're still friends			1
" cue the orchestra confidence restored , @entity21 breaks into song -- quickly followed by @entity2 -- with all the subtlety of , well , a show tune			1
although the bit had the apparent blessing of the network , there were no sacred cows			0
@entity2 brags of his ratings , now at a seven - week high , even as @entity6 may be plotting to usher him off the air in favor of @entity21 's appeal to younger demographic groups			1
talk about another network that might want to pick up a successful talk show host ? sure			0
" i 've got @entity82 on the line , " @entity2 croons			2
maybe the comedians hate each other			2
the entertainment press sure likes to pit the funnymen against each other			0
but does n't music make things better ? " tonight , tonight , why do they say we fight ? " the pair sang			0
" convinced ? a bit of controversy rumors about @entity21 supplanting @entity2 have been swirling since mid-march , when the @entity100 ' @entity99 reported that the network has made a commitment to @entity21 in regards to him succeeding @entity2			1
yet according to @entity99 , @entity21 's future as the new host of " tonight " is n't a done deal as much as it 's an understanding			0
" there 's no deal yet for the timetable of this , they have an understanding , " @entity99 told @entity110 's @entity109 last month " i 'm sure @entity2 knows about the understanding			2
but @entity2 has a contract that goes until the fall of next year			2
i think from @entity2 's point of view , he will work until they tell him to stop			2
that 's the way he is ; that 's the kind of guy he is			0
" still , the idea of @entity21 getting the show is n't a surprise , at least , not as much as the report that the show will move back to @entity51 from @entity130			0
" there 's a lot of reasons for it			0
i think they all feel that the energy of @entity51 helps @entity21 , " @entity99 said			0
" but also you have @entity138 , who 's the producer of the show , and has always been close to @entity3 , and he 's of course @entity51 - based			1
" and then you have the band , @entity142 , and @entity142 are a @entity143 - based band , and some of the guys i think still commute to @entity51 , and they 're very important to that show and i do n't think they wanted to lose them			2
" the punchline if the musical skit proves anything , @entity2 and @entity21 have n't lost their sense of humor under the scrutiny of the future of the " @entity24			1
" they even couched it with a dose of reality			0
in a pseudo-operatic climax , the pair asks : " tonight , tonight , who cares who hosts ' tonight ? ' " people just watch online the next day			0
