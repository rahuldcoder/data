-- @entity2 president @entity1 announced the resignations tuesday of three high - level government officials , most notably communications and transport secretary @entity6			1
the government of @entity2 president @entity1 , seen here in january , is facing elections in july			1
@entity10 , a key official for the powerful ministry that oversees @entity2 's government , also resigned			1
so did @entity13 , president of the @entity14			2
no official reasons were given for any of the resignations , which analysts said did not appear to be related			1
but at least two of the resignations did not come as a surprise			1
@entity21 , who stepped down from a cabinet - level post , had been involved for weeks in a controversy over taped comments revealed last month by @entity0 journalist @entity25			1
in the taped conversation , @entity21 said former @entity2 president @entity27 had stolen government money			1
@entity29 has not been formally accused of any crime			2
@entity21 received an anonymous threat in late february from an apparent political enemy telling him to resign or more damaging audiotapes would be released to the media			0
he refused and turned the matter over to authorities			0
@entity37 , a political analyst who is host of a daily radio show in @entity39 , called it " an almost soap opera - ish scandal " that left @entity1 little choice but to force @entity43 to resign			1
" although @entity1 wanted to keep him in office , it made it very difficult to keep him there , " she said			0
@entity1 moved @entity21 to a post as a presidential aide dealing with economic matters			0
other observers also were not surprised by the move			0
" that was waiting to happen , " said @entity54 , director of the @entity55 at the @entity57 - based @entity56			0
" but evidently the president values his counsel and has kept him in a high - profile position in the presidency from which he 'll continue to have influence			0
" @entity64 , the @entity65 national security adviser for president @entity66 in the 1970s , praised @entity21 but said political considerations prevailed			0
" he 's a very competent fellow , " @entity64 said			2
" one of the most competent people i 've known in @entity2			1
but this tape in particular was very embarrassing			0
" in a televised news conference after @entity1 announced the changes , @entity21 expressed his " gratitude for this opportunity that few @entity2 obtain			1
" replacing @entity43 will be @entity75 , the head of the @entity76			0
@entity77 belongs to the same party as @entity1 , the @entity79 [ @entity79 ] , while @entity21 belongs to the opposition @entity80 [ @entity80 ]			0
that played a role , @entity37 said			0
" the president is sending a signal to his party that he 's going to support people from his own party , " @entity37 said			2
" beyond the political scandals of the tapes , there 's a decision for the president to appoint people very close to the party			2
" @entity10 's departure was not a surprise either , since he is running for a congressional seat in july and @entity2 law requires him to resign			1
analysts spoke highly of @entity10 's replacement , @entity102			2
he had been the top person in the foreign ministry for @entity104 and @entity105			2
" @entity108 moving in is outstanding , " the @entity55 's @entity54 said , calling him " one of the smartest people ... i 've met " and " an impressive guy			2
" @entity110 takes over as head of the @entity14 , replacing @entity112 , whose reasons for resigning were not disclosed			0
@entity114 previously served as head of the @entity116 , the government 's book - publishing enterprise			1
the arts and culture post will play a significant role in 2010 , when @entity2 celebrates 100 years of its social revolution and 200 years of its declaration of independence , radio analyst @entity37 said			1
as for the timing of resignations from three key posts , @entity37 linked it to @entity2 's election calendar			1
" in order to understand these changes , " she said , " you have to understand there are midterm elections in july			1
so if there are going to be any changes , they have to take place right now			0
" meanwhile , @entity138 , president of the @entity57 - based @entity139 , said the changes do not portend a political shift			0
" this does n't sound like any major direction in change for @entity1 , " @entity138 said .			0
