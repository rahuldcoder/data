the nine - page report analyzing the @entity13 's response time and entry to the school during last december 's mass shooting was written by a subcommittee of four police chiefs from the state			1
" our evaluation showed that the officers of the @entity13 navigated the inevitable chaos created in the first few minutes of such a call , managed to piece together what was occurring , but were unable to intervene before the shooter took his own life , " according to the report , which was released thursday			1
the review references a @entity32 report that said , " police and other first responders arrived on scene about 20 minutes after the first calls			1

according to the report , the first call to police was at 9:35 a.m ; the first officer arrived two minutes and 41 seconds after the first radio broadcast of a shooting			1
the elapsed time between the first police officer 's arrival and police entry to the school was just under six minutes			2
