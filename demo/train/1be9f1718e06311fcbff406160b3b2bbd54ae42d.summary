@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity5 was carrying out a deadly rampage friday night around @entity0 , his parents were frantically trying to find him , having just received a chilling manifesto from their son			1
@entity5 , 22 , sent a couple dozen people -- including his parents and at least one of his therapists -- the 140 - page document via e-mail not long before the shootings began , @entity9 , a family friend , told @entity2			1
the manifesto is a lengthy chronicle detailing @entity5 's frustrations with his height , his parents ' divorce and rejection by women			1
it was obtained by the media on saturday , but it was not known then that his family had seen the document before the rampage			0
@entity5 's mother , @entity28 , who saw the e-mail at 9:17 p.m. @entity30 , immediately went to @entity5 's @entity32 page , where he had been known to post videos about himself			1
according to @entity9 , that 's when @entity5 's mother saw her son 's latest video , called " retribution , " that he posted friday , the day of the shootings			1
in the video , @entity5 outlined his plan of " slaughtering " women at a sorority house at the @entity44 at @entity0			1
his mother called @entity5 's father , @entity46 , and said he had to watch the @entity32 video			1
at the time , @entity48 had not yet seen the manifesto			0
@entity50 called 911 , and the parents set off for @entity0 from @entity52 , according to @entity9			1
en route , they heard there was a shooting			0
later that night , they found out their son was behind the violence			0
authorities say the killing rampage left six victims dead and 13 injured			0
it ended when @entity5 slammed into a parked vehicle and apparently shot himself in the head , police said			1
who were the victims ? there had been warning signs that @entity69 was struggling with mental health			0
his mother came across his @entity32 videos in april after she had n't heard from @entity5 in a few days , @entity9 said			1
she called one of his therapists , who then called a @entity0 mental health hotline			1
a woman on the hotline called police to check on him , @entity9 said			0
six policemen showed up at his house in @entity80 on april 30 , but they found nothing alarming , so they told @entity5 to call his mother and they reassured her that he was ok , according to @entity9			1
@entity0 county sheriff @entity82 told reporters saturday that at the time , deputies " determined he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary hold			2
" looking back , @entity5 's parents now feel that the well - being check in april by police was a " pivotal moment , " and his parents are frustrated , @entity9 said			1
he described it as a " missed opportunity " to really find out what was going on with @entity5 , but his parents admit that hindsight is always easy , @entity9 said			1
in fact , @entity5 himself wrote in the manifesto that he worried that someone had discovered his plan when the police visited			1
" i had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what i was planning to do , and reported me for it , " he wrote			0
" if that was the case , the police would have searched my room , found all of my guns and weapons , along with my writings about what i plan to do with them			0
i would have been thrown in jail , denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies			0
i ca n't imagine a hell darker than that			0
" he continued : " if they had demanded to search my room ... that would have ended everything			0
for a few horrible seconds i thought it was all over			0
when they left , the biggest wave of relief swept over me			0
" @entity82 told reporters that @entity5 suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue and was under the care of a variety of health care professionals			2
on sunday , the sheriff defended the april welfare check , saying on @entity2 's " @entity133 " that getting involved in mental health cases is a " delicate balance			1
" " you want to certainly intervene and obviously try to prevent a tragedy such as we 've experienced here			0
on the same token , you do n't want to stigmatize people who are seeking treatment for mental illness and you do n't want to prevent them from doing so because of the potential stigma that 's attached , " he said			2
" it 's a double - edged sword in some respects			2
" @entity5 had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8 , according to @entity9			1
he went to high school in @entity149 , @entity1 , and met with a therapist " pretty much every day , " @entity9 said			0
before his death , @entity5 was seeing two therapists , @entity9 added			1
" ( @entity5 ) has always been going to see someone , " he said , describing him as " reserved to a daunting degree			2
" but @entity9 said @entity5 did n't seem to have violent tendencies			2
in fact , there was no recent indication @entity5 was growing increasingly distant or that his condition was deteriorating , @entity9 added			2
@entity5 's father said a week ago that @entity5 seemed to be doing well " at the moment			1
" on thursday , he spoke to his father and said he was looking forward to seeing his family this weekend			2
@entity9 told @entity2 that @entity5 never expressed any fascination with guns			2
" @entity166 were never part of the dialogue , " he said			0
inside @entity5 's car friday night police found three handguns -- all legally purchased -- and more than 400 rounds of unused ammunition			1
@entity5 passed the background check needed to buy the firearm used in the shooting , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told @entity2			1
the official said nothing had been found in the gun trace to indicate @entity5 should have been disqualified			2
@entity9 also mentioned a feud that @entity5 had had recently with his roommates , saying @entity5 complained to his landlord that his roommates were too noisy and played lots of video games			0
@entity5 suggested they move out but was told that could n't happen			0
" ( his parents ) were conscious and concerned about their son 's health , " @entity9 said			0
" they thought he was in good hands			0
" but " in a moment of indescribable grief , " he said , they are " of course asking themselves , ' did we do as much as we can do ? ' " @entity2 's @entity200 contributed to this report .			0
