@entity0 , a nurse placed under mandatory quarantine in @entity2 , went on @entity3 on sunday and criticized the " knee - jerk reaction by politicians " to @entity10 , saying " to quarantine someone without a better plan in place , without more forethought , is just preposterous			1
" @entity0 , an epidemiologist who was working to help treat @entity10 patients in @entity12 , has tested negative twice for @entity10 and does not have symptoms , she said			1
she is quarantined for 21 days at @entity14 in @entity15			2
" this is an extreme that is really unacceptable , and i feel like my basic human rights have been violated , " @entity0 told @entity3 's @entity16 on " @entity17			1
" she described herself as " physically strong " but " emotionally exhausted			0
" " to put me through this emotional and physical stress is completely unacceptable , " she said			2
she slammed @entity2 gov. @entity21 for describing her as " obviously ill. " " first of all , i do n't think he 's a doctor ; secondly , he 's never laid eyes on me ; and thirdly , i 've been asymptomatic since i 've been here , " @entity0 told @entity22			1
in a separate interview with @entity3 senior medical correspondent @entity26 , @entity0 elaborated on what she thought of @entity21 's assessment of her medical condition			1
" i 'm sorry , but that 's just a completely unacceptable statement in my opinion			2
for ( @entity21 ) -- a politician who 's trusted and respected -- to make a statement that 's categorically not true is just unacceptable and appalling			2
" what would mandatory quarantines do ? " she 's fine			2
" @entity0 told @entity16 that mandatory quarantine is " not a sound public health decision " and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to @entity10 and public safety			1
" for the first 12 hours , i was in shock			0
now i 'm angry , " she added			0
on sunday , @entity0 's lawyers met with @entity0 at the hospital , saying they had a 75 - minute conversation through a piece of clear plastic while she sat inside the tent			1
she 's not sick , " lawyer @entity51 said in a sidewalk news conference aired on @entity3 affiliate wabc			1
" she went and did a magnanimous thing and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity , not put in isolation because some political leaders decided it looks good to do that			2
" lawyer @entity61 , former director of the @entity62 , said he 'll be filing papers in court for @entity0 to have a hearing no later than five days from the start of her confinement			1
he said the doctors at the hospital say there 's no medical reason to hold her			2
the policy christie enacted is unconstitutional and too broad , he said			0
" we need to know what the medical facts are and not rely on politicians who have their own vested interests , " he said			0
in a sunday evening news conference , @entity79 mayor @entity78 commented briefly on @entity0 's case , saying that " what happened to her was inappropriate			1
" " this hero was treated with disrespect and was not given a clear direction			0
" " we owe her better than that , and all the people who do this work , better than that , " he added			0
@entity10 gets political ' to put me in prison is just inhumane ' @entity0 arrived in @entity93 on friday afternoon and after a seven - hour wait at the hospital			1
she was put in an isolation tent inside @entity14 in @entity15			0
she 's twice tested negative for @entity10 , including a test at the @entity98 in @entity99			1
@entity0 says she has asked repeatedly but has n't been told how long she 'll be held at the hospital			1
" to put me in prison , " she said , " is just inhumane			1
" on sunday night , @entity79 gov. @entity103 announced he was changing the state 's mandatory 21 - day quarantine policy for health workers who return from the ebola zone			1
people who worked with @entity10 patients but do n't show symptoms of having the virus can serve their 21 - day quarantine at home , the governor 's office said			1
@entity21 spokesman @entity117 said late sunday night : " the protocol is clear that a @entity2 resident with no symptoms , but who has come into contact with someone with @entity10 , such as a health care provider , would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home			1
nonresidents would be transported to their homes if feasible and , if not , quarantined in @entity2			1
" on @entity128 sunday morning , @entity21 said he had " no second thoughts " about @entity2 's mandatory quarantine for health care workers			1
" i believe that folks who want to take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand that it 's in their interest and the public health interest to have a 21 - day period thereafter if they 've been directly exposed to people with the virus , " he said			1
@entity21 also told " @entity143 " that a voluntary system of quarantine is n't reliable			0
" i do n't believe that when you 're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system ; this is the government 's job			0
" at a news conference saturday , the governor said , " i 'm sorry if in any way she was inconvenienced , but inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much , much greater concern of mine			0
i hope she recovers quickly			0
" @entity0 said she has nothing to recover from			1
her temperature is normal , and she feels fine			0
" everyone keeps asking how i 'm feeling physically and of course i 'm fine physically , but i do n't think most people understand what it 's like to be alone in a tent and decisions are being made that do n't make sense and show no compassion , " @entity0 said , starting to cry			1
" i just feel like fear is winning right now , and when fear wins , everyone loses			0
" her life in quarantine she 's not allowed to have her luggage and was given paper scrubs to wear			2
@entity0 said she has no shower , no flushable toilet and the hospital gave her no television or any reading material			2
mostly , she says , she stares at the walls			0
on sunday afternoon , the hospital issued an update saying " the patient has computer access , use of her cell phone , reading material ( magazines , newspaper ) and requested and has received take - out food and drink			0
" @entity0 said she 's not allowed to see her lawyer or anyone else			1
" the tent has a window , and doctors talk to me in normal clothes from outside the window , " she says			0
" so if there 's no risk to them talking to me from outside the window , it does n't make any sense that my lawyer would n't be able to do the same			0
" a spokeswoman for the hospital said staff is trying to make @entity0 comfortable			2
" while we understand that the required quarantine is an inconvenience , it is our primary goal to make sure the patient is as comfortable as possible			0
we have given our prompt attention to provide the patient with basic needs and to accommodate additional requests made by the patient , " said @entity220 , spokesperson for @entity14 in @entity15			0
would policy discourage health workers ? @entity0 said she worries that her experience will discourage other aid workers from going to @entity230 to help quell the @entity10 outbreak			1
that thought was echoed by dr. @entity233 , an @entity10 survivor			2
he said he 's afraid some returning healthcare workers will skirt the system and end up not being monitored " you might have some renegade workers flying into @entity238 and then driving home and so they 're not on anyone 's radar , " he said			0
" if quarantines push people away from transparent , friendly , respectful , dialogue with public health workers , that may increase the risk back home			0
" @entity0 said she would welcome @entity21 to visit her in the hospital			2
" maybe he could tell me what ' obviously ill ' means			0
that would be great , " she said			0
she added that she does n't regret her trip to help @entity10 patients in @entity230			2
" someone asked me earlier would i do this again if i knew what would happen , and my answer is categorically yes , " she said			0
" i feel incredibly privileged to be able to do this work			0
" after hearing @entity0 's phone interview with @entity16 on sunday , @entity260 officials emailed @entity3 's " @entity17 " to refute some of the claims made by @entity0			1
in the email , @entity263 , communications director for the @entity2 @entity264 , wrote that @entity0 did receive reading materials and got computer access			1
@entity263 also wrote that " the patient was given a copy of the quarantine order on friday and is receiving regular updated information			0

@entity2 puts @entity0 into a 21 - day quarantine despite her testing negative for @entity10
@entity3 's @entity26 and @entity16 interview her
" to put me in prison is just inhumane , " she says
@entity2 and @entity79 governors have said tough measures are necessary
