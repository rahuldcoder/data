-- @entity1 left the @entity2 to jeers and catcalls after his @entity6 quarterfinal victory over @entity7 on thursday night			1
@entity1 celebrates after defeating @entity7 at the @entity6 on thursday			1
the @entity9 crowd was enraged by comments the @entity11 made in his post-match interview in which he criticized home favorite @entity7 in no uncertain terms			1
@entity1 had been angered by apparently light - hearted remarks made by @entity7 in which he accused the world number three of feigning injuries			1
" that 's not nice , anyhow , to say in front of this crowd that i have 16 injuries and that i 'm faking , " @entity1 blurted out after his four - set victory			1
" they 're already against me , because they think i 'm faking everything			0
" in @entity1 's last 16 match , a tough five - setter against @entity27 , the reigning @entity28 champion called for the trainer several times as he dealt with hip , ankle , stomach and breathing issues			1
asked then about @entity1 's problems , @entity7 joked whether the list should n't also include bird flu , anthrax , @entity39 and a common cold and said : " he 's either quick to call a trainer or he 's the most courageous guy of all time			1
" what most irritated @entity1 was what @entity7 said in an on - court interview on tuesday : " i 've got to feel good			1
he 's got about 16 injuries right now			0
" the remarks certainly acted as motivation , but he owed his 6 - 2 6 - 3 3 - 6 7 - 6 victory to uncharacteristic serving errors by eighth seed @entity7			2
after working his way back from a huge deficit , @entity7 was two points from forcing a fifth set at 5 - 4 , 30 - love in the fourth			2
but he double - faulted twice in a row and was broken for the fifth time -- twice more than he lost serve in his first four matches combined			0
" you know what ? i honestly do n't feel like they were super-tight doubles , " @entity7 told the @entity59			2
" i had been playing pretty high - risk , high - reward tennis to get back and i probably was n't about to stop			0
" @entity7 was also asked about his verbal squabble with @entity1 and immediately apologized			1
" it was completely meant in jest , " @entity7 said , pausing to choose the right words			2
" i should know better			0
but listen , i joke all the time			0
i do n't think anyone in their right mind takes me serious			0
" both men spoke in private after the incident and @entity1 was also contrite in his post-match press conference			1
" he made a joke and it was a misunderstanding , so i do n't blame it on him , " @entity1 said			2
" maybe i exaggerated and reacted bad in that moment			0
" third seed @entity1 was advancing to a semifinal meeting with former world number one @entity76 , a rematch of last year 's @entity6 final , which @entity76 won for his fourth consecutive title at @entity9			1
@entity76 -- bidding for a 13th major title , one shy of @entity82 ' record -- beat qualifier @entity84 7 - 6 6 - 4 7 - 6 earlier on thursday , again looking less than convincing in extending his own record by reaching the semifinals at an 18th consecutive grand slam tournament			1
new world number one @entity90 will face @entity92 's @entity91 in the other semifinal on ' " @entity94			0
" the men 's semifinals and women 's final are all scheduled for saturday , but tournament organizers have seen forecasts calling for about 12 hours of rain and wind at up to 35 mph that day			0
so they began the process of negotiating with tv networks and preparing contingency plans , including weighing the possibility of announcing friday that no tennis would be played saturday , and that the men 's final would be shifted from sunday to monday			0
in the women 's semifinals on friday , two - time champion @entity109 faces @entity112 , and @entity113 meets @entity114			2
