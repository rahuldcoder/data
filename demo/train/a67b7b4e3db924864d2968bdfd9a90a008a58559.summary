-- while the world watched the historic landing of a space probe on a comet 310 million miles from @entity5 , many were distracted by what was happening closer to home			0
@entity9 scientist @entity8 caused a firestorm with his choice of fashion during the @entity14 's live stream of wednesday 's @entity16 landing			1
@entity8 initially sported a shirt featuring women in lingerie , possibly not the wisest choice of attire given all of the discussion surrounding the challenges for women in the tech and science fields			1
" the fact that a scientist of any gender , but especially a man , would think it 's a good idea to wear a shirt covered in naked women while representing a major space agency and a significant research project is appalling ; and clearly , he had no idea that he was engaging in exactly the kind of casual sexism that drives women away from @entity42 , " @entity27 wrote in an article on @entity29			2
@entity42 is the acronym for science , technology , engineering and mathematics , and women in those disciplines have long complained of sexism and other difficulties in their male - dominated fields			0
the shirt quickly spawned its own hashtag on @entity55 -- # shirtstorm -- as both sexes took @entity8 to task			2
" no no women are toooootally welcome in our community , just ask the dude in this shirt , " tweeted the @entity60 tech writer @entity59			2

" you think a shirt like this makes women feel welcome ? i do n't , " @entity79 added when another @entity55 user questioned whether she was going too far			0
@entity27 wrote that the shirt was sexist and that " the people who were upset by it were n't just those silly oversensitive feminists who ca n't take a joke			0
scientists from all perspectives were unimpressed with the shirt , both on professional grounds and gendered ones			0
" @entity8 has been one of the most public faces of the mission and is known as an unconventional scientist			1
he sports tattoos all over his arms and , in honor of the @entity9 mission , got some new ink in january : a drawing of the space probe landing on the comet			0
during a recent @entity103 , @entity8 was asked about whether tattooed men can achieve greatness and said , " the people i work with do n't judge me by my looks but only by the work i have done and can do			2
" @entity8 reportedly changed out of the shirt during the live stream			1
on friday , he made an emotional apology during another live stream about the mission			1
" the shirt i wore this week , i made a big mistake , and i 've offended many people , and i am very sorry about this , " @entity8 said before wiping his eyes			1
