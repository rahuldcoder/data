the death rate due to cancer has declined in the @entity2 in recent years , largely due to better prevention and treatment			1
in fact , 650,000 lives were spared from cancer between 1990 to 2005 , according to new statistics from the @entity9			1
experts say prevention and improved treatment has lowered the @entity2 cancer death rate			1
during the 15 - year period , the cancer death rate among men dropped by 19.2 percent , mainly due to decreases in lung , prostate , and colon cancer deaths			1
in women , the cancer death rate fell by 11.4 percent , largely due to a drop in breast and colorectal cancer deaths			1
" this is good news because cancer death rates have continued to decrease since the early 1990s because of prevention and improved treatment for many cancers , " said lead author dr. @entity26 , the strategic director of cancer surveillance at the @entity9 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
" we have to be optimistic based on the trends			0
we are on the right track			0
" the findings are published in the july / august issue of @entity40 : a @entity41			0
despite the optimism , however , there is still much work to be done to win the war on cancer , experts stress			0
there will be close to 1.5 million new cancer diagnoses in the @entity2 in 2009 , and 562,340 people are expected to die of the disease			0
this means that more than 1,500 people will die of cancer each day in 2009 ; the most common lethal cancers in men and women are lung , prostate , breast , and colon cancers			2
@entity62 : how to avoid colorectal cancer a drop in hormone replacement therapy leads to a decline in breast cancer cases the decrease in deaths from breast cancer accounted for 37 percent of the reduction in the death rate among women during the 15 - year period			1
" any life spared from cancer or serious illness is a victory , but success comes in little steps -- one life at a time , " said dr. @entity75 , the president and founder of advocacy group @entity77 and the author of several books , including taking care of your girls : a @entity91 , @entity92 , and in - betweens			2
@entity75 is also the director of breast radiation oncology and breast health outreach at @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98			0
" it 's great news that a large chunk of the decreased death rates in women can be attributed to breast cancer , " she said			1
this is largely due to a decreased use of hormone replacement therapy ( @entity108 ) , which has been shown to increase a woman 's risk of developing breast cancer			1
@entity108 fell from grace after a large government - funded study known as the @entity115 was stopped early because the risks of @entity108 , including an increased risk of breast cancer , greatly outnumbered the benefits of the therapy			1
@entity62 : what breast cancer really feels like another reason for the decline in breast cancer deaths , however , is delayed diagnosis due to the fact that many women are not getting their yearly x-ray or mammogram			1
" fewer women are getting mammography and that 's why fewer women are getting diagnosed with breast cancer , so eventually that will come back and bite us in the rear end , " @entity75 said			1
black women continue to die of breast cancer at a greater rate than their white counterparts , she pointed out			1
what 's more , the current obesity epidemic may fuel a rise in the rates			0
" fat makes extra hormones , which lead to extra cell activity and extra abnormal cell activity , " she said			0
" @entity146 is a storing facility for hormonally active pollutants , so if you are overweight , you 're more likely to hold on to some chemicals in the environment that enter your body from food and water			0
" @entity62 : how to keep your food cravings at bay while you lose weight and that 's not all : " fat brings on puberty earlier and early puberty is a risk factor for breast cancer , " @entity75 said			2
" these areas of disappointment are areas of opportunity , " she added			0
but greater efforts are needed to encourage healthy eating and exercise to help combat obesity , especially in adolescents , she said			0
@entity62 : melt pounds with mix - and - match cardio routines another encouraging sign is a drop in colorectal cancer deaths due to better and more widespread screening			2
" colorectal cancer screening saves lives because it detects cancer at early stages when treatment is more effective , and it also removes precancerous lesions , " said @entity182			2
the current recommendation for people at average risk of colon cancer is to get regular screening tests starting at age 50			0
not all good news death rates from breast and colon cancers are falling , but the death rates from pancreatic ( women ) , liver ( men and women ) , and esophageal cancer ( men ) are increasing -- largely because of the obesity epidemic			1
among men , death rates for the fatal form of skin cancer melanoma are also on the rise			2
although there has been a decrease in lung cancer deaths among men ( due to smoking - cessation efforts ) , the death rates for women with lung cancer are still on the rise			2
lung cancer is expected to account for 26 percent of all cancer deaths in women in 2009 , according to the new statistics			2
@entity62 : my smoker 's cough turned out to be emphysema " we have n't seen a decrease here yet , but cigarette smoking in women peaked about 20 years later than it did in men , " @entity182 said			0
he predicts a decrease in lung cancer deaths in women in the next 5 years			0
