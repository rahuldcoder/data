-- in @entity3 's last tournament , he lost at the @entity4 to a player he had beaten 10 straight times			1
@entity3 returned to the singles court at the @entity8 on wednesday and in defeating @entity9 , ensured that another long winning streak did n't come to an end			1
whereas @entity3 was upset by @entity12 in @entity13 five weeks ago , he improved to 10 - 0 against @entity9 by downing the @entity14 6 - 4 6 - 3			1
having dipped to seventh in the rankings , @entity3 needs wins to ensure his participation at the year - end championships in @entity19 in november			1
he has appeared at the marquee event every year since 2002			2
@entity3 has n't dwelled on his defeat to @entity12 -- he told reporters this week he did n't want to think too much about it -- and is already looking forward to a " great " 2014 to dampen any talk of retirement			1
the @entity27 veteran was certainly sharper against @entity9 than @entity12 , especially after overturning an early break deficit in the first set			2
both players , however , hit more unforced errors than winners in @entity35 's top men 's tournament			0
@entity3 was the overwhelming crowd favorite , with fans chanting , " in , in , in " when the 17 - time grand slam champion challenged a forehand he hit that was called wide			1
" it was great energy , i must say , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" it gives me unbelievable motivation , inspires me to train hard , work hard , push further for that particular day , but also wanting to come back again next year , and again and again			0
" @entity46 watched part of his great rival 's match and was mobbed by fans wanting his autograph			0

the man he deposed as no. 1 did the same against @entity60			0
@entity61 , the top seed because the @entity64 draw was made last week , needed a medical timeout for a foot problem but still thrashed @entity60 6 - 2 6 - 0			1
" it was just an awkward movement , " @entity61 told reporters			0
" i was in an off - balance position			0
i was running and i made a quick movement that caused a sharp pain at that instant moment			0
" " but after the match we determined that it 's nothing serious , so it 's all fine			0
" @entity77 withdraws from @entity19 when @entity77 announced he would be undergoing back surgery last month , it was thought the @entity81 champion would n't return until 2014			1
but according to reports last week , @entity77 considered coming back at the year - end championships on home soil after a successful operation			1
alas , @entity77 ruled out that possibility wednesday			2
" i 'm really disappointed not to be playing this year , " @entity77 told the @entity88 's website			1
" i love playing in front of my home crowd			0
it 's a great atmosphere			0
" all the players look forward to competing in @entity19 and i 'll be doing my best to qualify again for the tournament next year			0
" his withdrawal realistically means that five players -- @entity3 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 -- are vying for the final two spots in the eight - man field			1
all four have advanced to the third round in @entity64 except @entity98 , who fell tuesday to @entity99 's @entity105 compatriot @entity104			2
@entity97 , who reached the last four in @entity13 , meets @entity99 on thursday .			0
