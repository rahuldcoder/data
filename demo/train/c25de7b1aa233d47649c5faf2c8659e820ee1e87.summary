-- @entity1 appealed for international aid for a remote region that has been under attack by roaming fighters , as thousands of residents fled into the bush to avoid the violence			1
the government declared @entity14 state a " humanitarian disaster area " and called on international aid agencies to help provide urgently needed assistance			1
it is not yet clear how many people have been killed or injured in the violence			2
the @entity18 said thursday it was mounting a " massive emergency support programme " to help those displaced by fighting			1
the organization sent a battalion of peacekeepers to the area last week amid reports that members of the @entity28 tribe were marching toward two towns which are home to the rival @entity32 tribe			0
the @entity28 fighters , who numbered 6,000 to 8,000 , have now agreed to leave the area following " intensive negotiations , " a @entity18 statement released thursday said			1
but as many as 50,000 people who fled their advance on the towns of @entity40 and @entity41 now need food , water and shelter			1
" the situation in humanitarian terms is grim , " @entity18 humanitarian coordinator @entity45 is quoted as saying			1
" they have n't had food ; they have n't had access to clean water			0
in a number of cases , some of the people are wounded			0
they have n't had shelter			0
as the day progresses , you can see hundreds of people coming back into town and there is no question they are in trouble			0
" the @entity65 has already delivered food supplies for some of the most vulnerable , including children , the statement said			0
@entity45 said the @entity18 had helped evacuate citizens from the area and avert a greater crisis			1
ethnic tensions in @entity14 state have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights , leading to cattle raids and abduction of women and children			1
government officials have urged the two ethnic groups to return women and children abducted in the spate of violence			1
more forces will be deployed and a committee established to push for reconciliation between the two groups , according to government spokesman @entity89			0
@entity90 , a spokesman for the @entity91 in @entity1 ( @entity92 ) , said thursday that the @entity18 was " beefing up " its presence across @entity14 in support of government efforts			1
@entity90 said the situation was now calm but @entity92 was operating daily land and air patrols to deter further violence and ensure the @entity28 fighters did leave the area			2
the mission would also help the @entity1 authorities transport about 800 additional police to the area , he said in a statement			0
@entity107 , @entity1 policy analyst with the @entity108 , said that while it 's important to get emergency food and medical aid to those affected , a longer - term strategy is needed to avoid future violence			2
" the underlying , largely economic , causes of this cycle of inter-communal violence must be addressed to ensure permanent peace and stability in @entity14 , " @entity115 said			1
" in @entity14 , cattle is currency			2
for instance , young men need cattle to pay dowry prices and marry			0
a lack of access to basic services and economic opportunities compounds the reliance of @entity14 's communities on this cattle economy , which , in turn , fuels conflict associated with cattle raiding , " she said			2
the international community should work to support the @entity1 government in developing its security forces and judicial system , she added			0
as residents fled the fighting last weekend , the @entity18 said peacekeepers were having trouble accessing the rugged and isolated region , which is surrounded by thick forests			2
" the problem we faced in this particular region of @entity14 state was one of access , because there are no roads , because of insufficient helicopters , " said @entity148 , the @entity18 peacekeeping chief			1
" so we did reinforce our available staff there			0
the government of @entity1 itself is trying to do the same , but facing the same constraints			0
" the violence in @entity14 state is the latest to rock @entity1 , which officially gained its statehood in july after separating from neighboring @entity1 to the north			1
decades of civil war between the north and south , costing as many as 2 million lives , ended with a @entity170 - brokered peace treaty in 2005			0
but before @entity1 gained independence in july , human rights monitors expressed concerns that long - standing grievances could end in violence consuming the region again			2
the @entity18 estimates that more than 1,100 people died and 63,000 were displaced last year by inter-communal violence in @entity14 , not taking into account the latest clashes			1
@entity0 's @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
