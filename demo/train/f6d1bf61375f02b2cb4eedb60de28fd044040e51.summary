-- the @entity1 took issue friday with the @entity5 government 's claim that there was a lack of evidence against 65 prisoners released this week over staunch @entity11 objections			1
" all of these individuals are people who should not be walking the streets , " said rear adm. @entity12 , a @entity1 spokesman			0
" and we had strong evidence on all of them , evidence that has been ignored , and that 's unsatisfactory to us			0
" he added that the prisoners posed threats not just to @entity11 forces , but also civilians , as many of the prisoners were accused of killing innocent @entity5 as well			1
the @entity11 military in @entity5 has said some of the men are linked to attacks that killed or wounded 32 @entity11 or coalition service members and 23 @entity5 security personnel or civilians			1
" they 're still very dangerous individuals who should have remained locked up , " @entity12 said			0
" there 's not going to be an active targeting campaign ... to go after them			0
that said , if they choose to return to the fight , they become legitimate enemies and legitimate targets			1
" @entity43 , the @entity5 attorney general , said thursday that the decision to release the prisoners was made " according to our law , " and @entity46 , head of the @entity47 , said the attorney general ordered the releases from the @entity50 -- formerly known as @entity52 prison -- after a careful review of 88 cases			1
in a statement posted on its website , the @entity11 @entity56 in @entity57 called the move " deeply regrettable , " saying the @entity5 government " bears responsibility for the results of its decision			1
" @entity12 suggested the move by the @entity5 government endangers the military mission there and is " unhelpful to the relationship that , that we want to have with @entity5			2
" he said that defense secretary @entity71 feels that this decision , along with other recent decisions made by @entity57 " make it that much harder for many of those on the @entity75 in @entity76 to further support the @entity5 missions			2
" a 23 - page document obtained by @entity0 @entity1 correspondent @entity81 from a @entity11 military official who asked not to be identified said about 19 of the released men were associated with direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 @entity11 or coalition force members			1
there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy			0
according to the document , 25 of the men were linked to the production or placement of @entity91 ; 33 tested positive for explosive residue when processed after capture ; and 26 were associated with attacks that killed or wounded 57 @entity5 citizens and @entity96			2
prior to the prisoners ' release , @entity11 authorities had repeatedly aired their displeasure over the plans			2
" we have made clear our judgment that these individuals should be prosecuted under @entity5 law			0
we requested that the cases be carefully reviewed , " the @entity11 military said ahead of the release			1
" but the evidence against them was never seriously considered , including by the attorney general , given the short time since the decision was made to transfer these cases to the @entity5 legal system			0
" @entity115 secretary general @entity114 said he was " gravely concerned " by the decision , " which appears to have been made based on political calculations and without regard for due process before the @entity5 courts			0
" in a statement , he called it " a major step backwards for the rule of law in @entity5			0
" the @entity11 military noted that the group included an alleged @entity127 explosives expert , a suspected @entity129 commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices			1
@entity5 president @entity133 defended the releases and slammed the @entity11 for criticizing them			2
" @entity5 is a sovereign country , " he said			0
" if the @entity5 authorities decide to release a prisoner , it is of no concern to the @entity11 and should be of no concern to the @entity11 and i hope that the @entity11 would stop harassing @entity5 's procedures and judicial authority and i hope that the @entity11 will now begin to respect @entity5 sovereignty			1
" @entity0 's @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
