-- disappointment , anger , disgust			0
words like these are echoing throughout social media about a national icon : the @entity7			1
to put it mildly , @entity8 is going through a rough patch			0
in july , the @entity7 national headquarters clarified its ban on gays and lesbians -- leaving it in place and triggering a national movement by hundreds of former @entity16 to renounce their rank and return their treasured medals			1
and then this week , the so - called " perversion files " were publicly released , naming more than 1,000 suspected child sex abusers since the mid- 1960s with links to @entity8			1
all this has people asking questions : what 's going on here ? is scouting in trouble ? is it even relevant anymore ? although membership has remained steady at 2.7 million youths , many parents are taking a hard look at the organization -- especially its ban on gays , lesbians , atheists and agnostics , says former @entity40 , an online activist			1
" some of the aspects of @entity8 morality i find is sort of old school -- like they 're stuck in the 1950s			0
" it 's become more acceptable , he says , for people to be atheist and agnostic and still be considered moral in our society			0
also , " attitudes around homosexuality have changed a lot in the last few decades , and the @entity7 ' moral code has n't kept up with those changes			1
" here 's how mainstream the idea of gay and lesbian @entity16 has become : both president @entity58 and @entity59 support it			2
@entity58 , in fact , serves as honorary @entity7 president , a tradition held by every commander in chief since the group was founded			1
eventually , the @entity7 will have to change , @entity66 says , or else the organization will become socially irrelevant			1
the group is standing at a key moment in its survival , says @entity66			0
if it fails to " get with the modern times " within the next decade , " alternative youth organizations will appear that are more inclusive and based on equality			2
" the majority of @entity16 agree with the policy , the @entity7 said in july			1
but " no single policy will accommodate the many diverse views among our membership or society			0
" scouting offers to teach members skills in " character building " and making good " moral choices , " says @entity7 spokesman @entity87			1
but he also says it 's important to separate " the discussion of larger societal issues " from the operation of scouting			2
" the state of scouting is very strong			1
" ' living your values ' the idea is sometimes referred to as " living your values " -- in other words , interacting only with organizations and businesses that match your morals and ethics			0
" people with young kids are trying to live their lives more in accordance with their beliefs and their values , " says @entity66			0
it 's hard , he says , to participate in something like the @entity7 and everyday question your own integrity			1
in protest , @entity66 sent his @entity16 medal back to @entity115 headquarters a few months ago , along with hundreds of other ex-scouts			0
read a blog written by @entity116 who 've renounced their @entity16 awards boy scout policies and procedures evolve over time , says @entity87			2
for example , the child sex abuse concerns decades ago spurred the @entity7 to implement strict screening , education and prevention policies that continue today and represent a " gold standard " for protecting kids , @entity87 says			1
boy scout @entity128 of @entity130 , @entity131 , does n't like the ban on atheists or gays and lesbians			1
so the 16 - year - old basically looks the other way , he says , along with the rest of @entity140			0
" in my troop i do n't know of any particular scouts that are gay or atheist , but i know that our troop would n't necessarily kick a @entity115 out of the troop for being gay or atheist			1
" @entity128 's dad , psychology professor @entity148 , does n't see any conflict between his support for scouting and his opposition to the bans			1
@entity128 says he does his best to live his values and to make changes where he can			0
" but at the end of the day we 're not going to agree 100 % with all the policies and procedures of every organization that we 're a part of -- whether it 's @entity16 or the @entity163 government or churches or companies			2
" related : boy scouts feel a mother 's wrath @entity170 's troop was n't so understanding			1
when @entity170 , who lives in @entity171 , @entity131 , was denied his @entity16 rank because he 's gay , he mounted a campaign that gained national attention			2
part of that campaign included collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition for local @entity115 officials			0
so far , @entity170 is still waiting to get his @entity16			0
what if @entity8 disappeared ? you 'd likely see more than $ 206,000,000 worth of yearly services and charity fundraising provided by @entity115 groups disappear , according to @entity7			1
religious ties many critics who accuse the @entity16 of failing to change with the times blame @entity7 's deep connections to organized religion			2
approximately 70 % of scout troops are affiliated with some kind of church or religious group , says @entity87			0
among the biggest backers are the @entity195 and @entity196 , according to @entity7			2
in 2011 , @entity199 - backed @entity115 and @entity198 units accounted for more than 420,000 of all scouts nationwide , while more than 200,000 other scouts were members of units affiliated with the @entity195			0
links with religious groups are " definitely part of our longstanding tradition , " says @entity87			0
" our policies and procedures and everything that we are is definitely reflected by our membership and our charter organization partners			0
" boy scouts claim kids safer with them than at home those affiliations over the years have resulted in a complicated political maze that 's difficult to navigate when it comes to change , @entity66 suggests			1
" oh yeah -- the @entity195 and @entity199 churches have a lot of influence on the @entity7 , especially the leadership of the @entity7 , " he says			2
" i certainly believe that 's a big part of why the @entity7 have stubbornly held onto this policy			2
" it would be a much better organization , not having those people involved			0
but it 's not going to go away immediately			0
" there 's also dissent among leaders inside @entity8 -- although many keep a low profile			0
one scout leader , who asked to remain anonymous because he fears losing his position , posted comments on a private online message board for @entity16 alums			0
if the @entity163 military can accept openly gay and lesbian troops , he asked , why ca n't the @entity7 ? " every day i question my personal integrity for choosing to stay involved with a discriminatory organization			1
" so -- does @entity163 still need the @entity7 ? is it still culturally relevant as it enters its second century of service ? will the @entity7 make it to 200 years ? what do you think ? share your thoughts as well as your stories about scouting connections and experiences in the comments section below .			1
