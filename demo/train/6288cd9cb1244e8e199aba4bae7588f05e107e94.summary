ten states are being granted waivers to free them from some requirements of the @entity3 education reform law , with president @entity5 explaining thursday that the move aims to " combine greater freedom with greater accountability			1
" @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18 are the first of what could be many more states that will no longer have to meet 2014 targets set by the law			1
in exchange for that flexibility , those states " have agreed to raise standards , improve accountability , and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness , " the @entity24 said in a statement thursday morning			1
@entity5 elaborated on the rationale for the decision later in the day , speaking at a @entity24 event attended by teachers and school superintendents			1
he stressed that his administration remains committed to the overarching goals of raising standards and closing the achievement gap in the nation 's public schools			2
at the same time , " we determined we need a different approach " than what was prescribed by the landmark legislation			0
" we 've offered every state the same deal : we 've said , if you 're willing to set higher , more honest standards then we 're going to give you the flexibility to meet those standards , " @entity5 said			1
each of those states granted waivers thursday offered different approaches			2
@entity14 , for instance , set a goal to slash its number of underperfoming students by half within six years ; @entity9 is setting up a comprehensive online database of assessment measures , among other steps ; and @entity16 is developing an " early warning " system in an effort to prevent students from dropping out of school			2
@entity69 also requested such flexibility from the @entity3 law , and the @entity5 administration is working closely with that state			1
another 28 states , @entity75 , and the @entity76 also have indicated plans to seek such flexibility , according to the @entity24			2
" this is good news for our kids , it 's good news for our country , " the president said of the waivers , adding that one approach may work well in one part of the country while another may better suit another place			2
" if we 're serious about seeing our children reach their full potential , the best ideas are n't just going to come from here in @entity76			0
" @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 , @entity99 , sent a joint letter last summer to education secretary @entity101 calling the then prospect of allowing waivers a " cause for concern			2
" " issuing new demands in exchange for relief could result in greater regulations and confusion for schools and less transparency for parents , " the two @entity107 members wrote			2
" additionally , the proposal raises questions about the department 's legal authority to grant constitutional waivers in exchange for reforms not authorized by @entity123			1
" and last month , @entity96 again criticized @entity5 for having " the audacity to circumvent the people 's elected representatives by granting @entity3 waivers with special strings attached , " according to a press release from his office			1
still , the decision was cheered by leaders from several states -- many of them led by @entity136 governors -- who successfully obtained waivers , as well as the country 's largest teacher 's union			1
@entity10 education commissioner @entity143 , for instance , said the change was needed , because having federal accountability measures " overlaying " state ones was " confusing			0
" @entity148 superintendent @entity147 described the waiver for his state as " wonderful news for @entity11 's students , educators and parents			0
no longer will we be bound by the narrow definitions of success found in @entity3			0
" and @entity12 gov. @entity158 , who was president @entity159 's director of the @entity160 when the law was passed , described @entity3 as " an important step forward , but it needed additional flexibility that @entity123 has n't yet provided			1
" " the waiver will make for a fairer system and one that focuses on what matters most : getting the whole system to perform better in terms of student learning , " he said in a statement			0
the president of the @entity172 , which represents 3.2 million teachers and administrators and has endorsed @entity5 's re-election bid , lauded those states granted waivers who " have committed to working with teachers , parents and other community stakeholders to implement changes designed to better support students			1
" at the same time , union president @entity184 described the waivers as a temporary move as he pushed for passage of more " comprehensive " reform			0
@entity159 signed @entity3 into law in 2001			1
one of the bipartisan bill 's sponsors was the late sen. @entity193 , a @entity194 from @entity14			0
the law included a focus on measuring student outcomes , largely based on standardized test results			0
some supporters say it has helped close an achievement gap between disadvantaged students and others			0
but the law is a source of controversy , with opponents arguing it is turning classrooms into test preparation centers , taking time away from subjects that are n't tested , and potentially contributing to cheating scandals			0
secretary @entity101 says the law drives down standards , weakens accountability , causes narrowing of the curriculum and labels too many schools as failing , the @entity24 said in its news release			1
" moreover , the law mandates unworkable remedies at the federal level instead of allowing local educators to make spending decisions , " it said			0
the law has been in need of reauthorization since 2007 , and the president has been critical of the lack of congressional action on the matter in recent years			0
last september , the @entity5 administration announced that states could apply for waivers from some provisions of the law if they meet other federal mandates			1
to get the waivers , states had to adopt and have a plan to implement " college and career - ready standards , " the @entity24 said			1
" they must also create comprehensive systems of teacher and principal development , evaluation and support that include factors beyond test scores , such as principal observation , peer review , student work , or parent and student feedback			0
" based on standards set by the existing law , more schools were listed as failing last year than in any previous year since the law 's passage			1
about 48 % of schools did not make what 's called " adequate yearly progress " in 2011 , up from 39 % in 2010 , according to the nonprofit @entity266			0
in his remarks thursday , @entity5 expressed confidence that the academic performance of the nation 's students would improve using a more flexible approach -- though he also emphasized that any change wo n't be instantaneous			2
" this is not a one - year project , this is n't a two - year project , " he said			0
" this is going to take some time , but we can get it done			0

a @entity136 *lawmaker* has said the waivers *wrongly* " circumvent " @entity123
