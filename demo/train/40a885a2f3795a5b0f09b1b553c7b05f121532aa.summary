@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 , who is considering a presidential run , said sunday that president @entity4 has thrown away valuable leverage to bring about political changes in @entity7			1
he also took another opportunity to attack his potential opponent for the @entity11 presidential nomination , @entity13 sen. @entity12 , who agrees with @entity4 's decision to switch course on @entity7			1
the most vocal @entity11 leading the fight against @entity4 's rapprochement with @entity7 insisted again that @entity4 's new policy wo n't bring democracy to the island			1
" my opposition to what the president has done is it wo n't do anything to further that cause ( of democratization ) , " @entity2 said on @entity23 's " @entity22			2
" " there has to be some reciprocal opening on their part toward democracy and there was none in this engagement			0
" @entity2 , who is @entity38 , also said @entity7 democracy activists " feel betrayed " by @entity4			1
" he completely ignored them and threw them to the side in this whole process , " @entity2 said , adding that he would have " actively and vibrantly engaged " those activists if he were president			2
and the slugfest between @entity2 and @entity12 continued sunday			1
just days after @entity2 said @entity12 " does n't know what he 's talking about , " the @entity13 senator swung back friday on @entity50 calling @entity2 's remarks " rude and intemperate " and suggesting @entity2 was promoting " a policy of isolationism " toward @entity7 that has n't brought about regime change			1
@entity2 did n't bow out on sunday , once again aiming his arrows at @entity12 in a preview of what could come in an eventual @entity11 presidential primary bout			2
" @entity12 , if he wants to align himself and become a supporter of the @entity4 foreign policy , particularly toward @entity7 , that 's his right , he has a right to do that , " @entity2 said on sunday			1
@entity2 also accused @entity12 of becoming the " chief cheerleader of @entity4 's foreign policy , " on @entity68 's " @entity67			1
" that prompted @entity12 and his senior adviser , @entity70 , to fire back			0
" with all due respect , sen. @entity2 was captain of the @entity11 cheerleading team for @entity4 's arming of @entity75 rebels , bombing @entity76 resulting in a jihadist wonderland and illegally giving foreign aid to @entity80 's military government			1
the @entity83 foreign policy has made the @entity84 and @entity85 less safe , " @entity70 said in a statement provided to @entity1			0
@entity2 has won the support of most of his @entity11 colleagues in the @entity88 , with some joining him in attacking the policy shift and others , like incoming senate majority leader @entity91 , deferring to @entity2 's expertise on the subject			2
defenders of @entity4 's decision to ease sanctions on @entity7 and normalize diplomatic relations with the island nation , including @entity12 , have called the embargo and sanctions on @entity7 a 50 - year policy that has failed to provoke any political change and have pointed to @entity104 decision decades ago to engage and trade with @entity106 and @entity107			1
@entity2 on sunday looked to spin those examples to his advantage , saying the @entity104 should " learn our lessons from those policies , " calling @entity106 's regime more oppressive than when the @entity104 normalized relations with @entity106 in the ' 70s			1
" certainly the @entity106 economy has grown , but politically they 're more repressed than they were twenty or thirty years ago			0
there 's no freedom of religion , no freedom of speech , no free access to the @entity122 , no elections , no political parties , " @entity2 said			0
" so in essence , that is the model the @entity7 will try to follow			0
" and while embracing that analogy , @entity2 also dismissed a comparison between @entity7 and @entity106 when prompted about whether he would end the @entity104 's trade relations with @entity106 if he became president , noting that there are " geopolitical realities " when it comes to the @entity134 power			1
" my interest here is singular , and that is freedom and democracy for the people of @entity7 , " @entity2 said			2
" i just do n't think that this policy that the president has put in place furthers that goal			0
in fact , i think it makes it harder to achieve			0
" but @entity2 may not be the only @entity149 politican with strong views on the issue entering the 2016 @entity11 fray of presidential hopefuls			0
former gov. @entity154 , who announced this week he is " actively " exploring a presidential run , also slammed @entity4 this week for rewarding @entity7 's dictators , calling it an " ill - advised move			2
" and while @entity154 has been a mentor to the younger @entity2 in many ways , @entity2 said a @entity154 candidacy would not deter him from his own			0
" @entity154 if he runs will be a very credible and formidable candidate , " said @entity2 , who has not yet made a decision about running			0
" when you reach a point where you 're thinking about running for president -- as i am -- what you have to make your decision on is not on who else is running , it 's on whether you think that 's the right place for you to achieve your agenda and serve your country			0
" @entity1 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0

sen. @entity2 continued to bash president @entity4 and sen. @entity12 for their support of normalizing relations with @entity7
@entity2 says is @entity12 wants to align himself with @entity4 's foreign policies , " he has a right to do that "
