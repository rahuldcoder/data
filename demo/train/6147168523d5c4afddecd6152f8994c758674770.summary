-- " i 'm here , where are you ? " it happens all the time			2
you 're waiting to meet a friend and get a call or text like this			2
" but i 'm here , " you insist			0
even with addresses in hand , exact locations often remain elusive , and meet - ups get missed			0
the usual response -- a quick look around , squinting to make out some local landmark to tell them to meet you by -- might be okay for some			0
but having spent ten years in the music and events business , @entity17 was tired of spending his time telling suppliers , staff , and guests where to look for a venue 's back or side entrance			1
in businesses like his , the small nuisance can become a timewasting burden : " we always had this problem , " he says			0
@entity32 ( @entity33 ) believes it has found a solution			1
the start - up , co-founded last year by @entity17 , divides the entire world into a grid of three meter by three meter squares -- 57 trillion of them in total			1
each square has been labeled with a three word sequence			2
standing beneath the @entity42 ? you 're at " shut.tech.requests			0
" want to meet on the front doorstep of @entity46 ? tell a friend " sound.manual.lungs			0
" climbed to the top of @entity50 ? that 's " snake.removes.gymnast "			0
" now , anyone can just say ' table.lamp.spoon ' and it 's much easier than giving a full address and explanation of how to find a location , " says @entity17			1
in developed western countries , the precise system could be the answer to countless small problems , and over this summer the company has highlighted how @entity33 can help in jumbled music festival campsites , and sprawling parking lots			1
in the developing world , competing address systems can create confusion or , worse , no formal address system is present			1
how it works @entity17 knew the solution was already out there			1
@entity72 can give you gps coordinates that will direct someone to a precise location			2
but remembering the 15 digit code -- or communicating one to a delivery driver down a dodgy phone line while organizing a busy event -- is bound to end in failure			2
" for human beings , it 's completely impractical , " he says @entity32 has received $ 1.5m in start - up funding since it launched last year and the company is now expanding to incorporate more languages			1
with each new language -- @entity96 , @entity95 , @entity94 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93 are all available -- each square is assigned an additional name			0
there 's almost 40,000 words of each language in the mix , but @entity33 has allocated the shortest , most commonly used ones to the areas where they 're most likely to be used			0
so the front steps of the @entity107 in @entity108 are called " calf.router.shunted " if you search in @entity96 , but the more common words " skri.elev.skrika " in @entity107			0
to streamline the process , @entity17 explains that the team have removed all the homophones from the mix -- so you wo n't end up wondering if your friend said " teas , " " tease , " or " tees " -- as well as controversial spellings			1
gone , too , are all those explicit words you that you probably would n't want to say to direct visitors to your front door			0
unfortunately , language is rarely that simple and even three apparently innocent words , arranged appropriately -- say " lazy.trouser.snake " ( a roadside plot just outside @entity129 , @entity130 ) -- are bound to haunt a few addresses			2
@entity17 says there 's no way of changing each allocated address , but that they have n't had any complaints yet			1
and , besides , a dodgy name has done no harm to many traditional addresses			0
big impact ? @entity17 , meanwhile , is thinking big , and the company is pondering what role the three - word system could offer in countries where development can be obstructed by a lack of a reliable , intuitive , system of addresses			1
" in a lot of the developing world , addresses are something governments have been working on for sometimes a decade , " says @entity17			1
he believes , @entity33 can offer a ready - made system , allowing governments to forget what to call a place , and to focus on helping the people there			2

@entity32 aims to *replace* every address with a simple three word code
*ceo* @entity17 says the new system is faster , simpler and more precise
it promises to *connect* those in the developing world who lack a reliable address system
but what if your three word address was less than *flattering* ?
