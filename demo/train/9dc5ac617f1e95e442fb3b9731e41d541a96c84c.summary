@entity0 -- hours after being mobbed by hundreds of cheering fans at the airport upon his arrival , former @entity3 striker @entity2 made his official debut with new team @entity8 saturday afternoon and insisted his move was motivated by challenges of helping @entity12 football			1
" i did n't come here with the idea of making a lot of money , " said the 34 - year - old @entity14 football superstar at a press conference , despite local news reports naming him the highest paid player in @entity12 who earns more than $ 300,000 a week			1
" i came here because of the completely different challenges from what i 've seen in @entity24 before , " he said			0
" i am here to win matches and be the champion -- i am not here to retire , " he added			2
shortly after scoring the penalty that crowned @entity3 champions of @entity24 , @entity2 signed an undisclosed two - and - a - half - year contract with @entity8 last month			1
he joins former @entity3 teammate @entity32 -- who made the switch in january with a similar reported annual salary of $ 15 million -- at a once - proud football club now struggling to keep its spot in the @entity37			1
" we have a difficult job to do , but we are going to work hard and try to make our fans happy , " said @entity2 , before reminding the audience of @entity3 's gradual ascent			2
" maybe it 's going to take time but , believe me , we are going to do everything to achieve it			0
" his arrival highlights the spending spree by @entity12 football clubs on foreign talent			1
supporters argue that @entity12 players need to learn from the best and international stars give the sport 's weak following in @entity12 a much - needed boost			2
" the most important thing is that i come here to help @entity12 football , " @entity2 said			1
" i think i have a little bit of experience -- i come here to share that experience and some knowledge			0
" critics , however , describe the luring of top players to @entity12 as vanity projects by club owners more interested in benefiting their business empires than developing football at the grassroots level in the world 's most populous nation			1
@entity8 's owner , @entity72 , is an online gaming tycoon whose deep pockets brought @entity2 and @entity32 to @entity0			2
but his company 's latest product -- " @entity75 " -- was prominently featured on @entity2 's uniform in a huge portrait that adorned the backdrop of the press conference , as fiery scenes from the game splashed on big screens			2
" they play for @entity8 , but they also serve as marketing vehicles for the parent company , " said @entity84 , managing editor of the @entity12 edition of @entity86			0
" football-wise , the money is obviously over the top -- but if you look at the bigger picture , the money is well spent			0
" on the outskirts of @entity97 , coach @entity95 feels even more concerned about the " money as solution " approach to improve @entity12 football			1
teaching a children 's football summer camp one recent morning , the former professional player said sports officials and club owners are focusing on the wrong thing			0
" i think @entity12 football is a bit too eager to achieve quick success and get instant benefits , " he said			1
" football is not so popular in @entity12 like in neighboring @entity112 and @entity113 , because they put great emphasis on training and cultivating young players			2
" a tarnished reputation does n't help , either , as @entity12 football has been dogged by years of corruption and mismanagement			1
since a nationwide crackdown began three years ago , dozens of senior football figures have been convicted of taking bribes and fixing matches , including two former national league chiefs who were both recently sentenced to more than 10 years in prison			0
" there were some problems , " said @entity2			0
" the fact that they put it in the frontline -- it 's because they want to stop it -- so it 's good for football			0
" and his mere presence in @entity0 appears to have already brought good fortune to @entity8			0
with @entity2 watching from the sidelines , the team beat archrival @entity139 3 - 1 in a home game on a rainy saturday night -- exactly what the nicknamed " @entity143 " promised fans earlier .			0
