ten - year - old @entity0 does n't understand why he got suspended from school for three days			1
according to his father , @entity3 , one moment the boy was " goofing off " with his friends in fifth - grade science class , and the next the teacher was taking him out of the classroom , invoking @entity11 's zero - tolerance policy			1
the offense ? @entity0 was " making his fingers look like a gun , having the thumb up and the pointed finger sticking out , " said @entity3 , describing the february 26 incident			1
" he was pointing it at a friend 's head and he said ' boom			1
' the kid did n't see it			2
no other kids saw it			2
but the teacher saw it , " he said			0
" it was n't threatening			0
it was a 10 - year - old kid playing			1
" the next morning @entity3 escorted his son @entity0 to the principal 's office , where they met with @entity36 principal @entity35			2
" she said if it happened again the suspension would be longer , if not permanent , " said @entity3 , who also received a letter explaining the reason for @entity0 's suspension as a " level 2 look alike firearm			1
" the letter , which @entity3 shared with @entity45 , read , " @entity0 put his fingers up to another student 's head , simulating a gun , and said , ' boom , ' " @entity35 's office referred @entity45 's call to @entity54 spokesman @entity53			1
@entity35 " has been warning the students for some weeks , " said @entity53			0
" we 've had a problem at this school			0
the boys have gone around fake shooting and making paper guns at class			2
she has sent notes to parents for the past three weeks alerting them of the problem			0
" @entity3 said he never received a notice , but was aware of school authorities telling students , including @entity0 , that any gun - related behavior would have serious consequences			1
" i do n't know if it 's to the point it happened so much they needed to punish somebody to set an example			1
i do n't know , it blows my mind , " said @entity3			0
@entity53 acknowledged there was likely no ill - intention in @entity0 's actions			1
" i know he ( @entity0 ) felt it was funny and in jest , but the teacher felt it was inappropriate given the warnings that were given			0
" @entity53 said @entity0 was n't singled out as an example , but that his was the first incident after @entity35 gave " her final notice last week			0
" common sense ? @entity11 's " zero - tolerance " rules in public schools came under attack in january when state sen. @entity98 introduced bill @entity100 167 to reverse or reform the original 1998 law introduced as part of @entity103			1
the 1998 bill mandated schools " adopt a policy of zero tolerance for violent , disruptive , or inappropriate behavior , including excessive truancy			1
" @entity100 55 also called for schools to " establish strategies to address such behavior that range from prevention to intervention , " but @entity115 believes schools have opted for punishment strategies instead			0
" we have moved away from common sense , ensuring that the punishment fits the infraction , " said @entity115			0
" we should maintain the highest form of punishment which is expulsion or suspension to those cases that cause the most harm			2
" @entity128 statistics show @entity0 is n't alone			0
according to state disciplinary figures for the 2012 - 2013 school year , a total of 419 statewide students , from various grade levels , were suspended because of an incident in the category of " firearm look - a - likes , " and an additional 38 students were expelled			1
in the @entity54 district , where @entity0 goes to school , 12 students were expelled because of incidents in the " firearm look - a - likes " category , while 69 students were suspended			1
contrast that with categories such as harassment and intimidation , in which zero students were expelled , though 1527 were suspended districtwide			2
@entity115 has been trying to build consensus for her bill arguing that the current law is outdated because it does n't take into consideration other factors , such as behavior and mental health			0
" the bigger issue is that we need more behavior health and counseling at school so we can look at the root cause of why this child is acting out and being disruptive , " said @entity115			0
@entity3 agrees and said he is planning to reach out to @entity115			0
he has struggled to help @entity0 make sense of what happened			2
" how much of a threat can it really be for a 10 - year - old to hold up his fingers ? " said a frustrated @entity3			1
" i would like for somebody to explain this to me because apparently i do n't get it			0
this is way over the boundary			0
a teacher could have talked to him and sat him down , given him detention , but a three days suspension ? " @entity3 is the father of five children , including @entity0 , and he says none of them have ever gotten in trouble at school			2
when asked what has @entity0 learned from this incident , @entity3 paused , then scoffed : " he 's learned never to make his fingers like a gun a school again			1
i do n't know if you consider that a life lesson			0
