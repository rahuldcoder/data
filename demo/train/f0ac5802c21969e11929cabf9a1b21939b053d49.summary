@entity0 tied @entity1 for 49th place in voter turnout in the november election -- and i 'm pretty pumped about it			1
that may seem like a strange thing to be excited about , or even to know about , but hear me out on this : since september , i 've been writing about @entity0 's lowest - of - the - low voter turnout rate for a new @entity12 project called @entity13			1
the goal , as the project name spells out in even - @entity20 $ ha - can - understand terms ( sorry , @entity17 $ ha , i 'm sure you 're smart , but that dollar sign ... ) , was to bump @entity0 off the bottom of that list			1
and i wanted to do that with your help			0
dozens -- probably hundreds -- of you responded , making online pledges to vote for the first time and sending sometimes - pestering , sometimes - sweet messages to six nonvoters in @entity0 whose stories we highlighted on this website			1
change the list : 47 of your pro-voting arguments in the end , both @entity0 and @entity1 registered turnout rates of 44.2 % * , according to @entity38 , an associate professor at @entity39 who runs a site called the @entity41			1
both states -- and many others -- saw a decline in turnout from the 2008 election			1
nationwide , turnout dropped by about 3 % , @entity38 said by phone			2
( it 's impossible to be more precise because several states still have n't submitted their certified turnout numbers ; blame funding and mail - in ballots for that , he said			1
) @entity0 's turnout dropped 4.6 % , by comparison			1
that sounds like bad news			0
and , in some respects , it is			0
the situation at some polling places did n't make it easy to vote			0
more than two dozen of them on the island of @entity66 alone ran out of ballots on @entity68			2
a polling place volunteer at one elementary school told me he had to start handing out @entity73 - language ballots to @entity75 speakers just to keep the line moving			2
the state should institute same - day voter registration and other reforms that would encourage new voters to go to the polls			1
but if the goal of this project was for @entity0 not to be ranked 50th out of 50 states , then a tie for 49th has to be seen as some sort of victory			1
if nothing else , it 's a step in the right direction			2
plus , your participation in this effort resulted in several unequivocal successes			0
my favorite : a single message from a @entity98 fan of @entity99 persuaded @entity100 , a sous - chef in @entity101 , @entity0 , to vote			2
he told me he would n't have cast a ballot otherwise			2
here 's the note that did the trick : " send him a free ticket to @entity106 and ( show ) him how many reasons there are to vote , since all those there died for that right , here and abroad			2
" three of the six nonvoters we featured decided to vote because of your messages			0
of course , six people wo n't move the needle on a state 's voter turnout rate , but those three people 's voices were heard by their government when they otherwise would n't have been			1
@entity12 , of course , ca n't take credit for the people who woke up in @entity0 , way out in the middle of the @entity130 , on november 6 and decided to vote			1
this project received ample coverage in local news , and for that i 'm very grateful to websites like @entity135 and tv stations like @entity137 for spreading the word about @entity0 's low voter turnout rate			1
but voting ultimately is an intensely personal act			0
the people who really can improve @entity0 's voting record are those who live in @entity0 and who want to make a difference			1
they 're people like @entity146 , who never voted until an issue moved her so much that she decided to run for office			0
she now is a county councilwoman in @entity149			0
and they 're people like @entity151 , who goes door to door on @entity66 trying to persuade people to vote -- for any candidate , regardless of political party			0
there are people like that in every state , working to make the @entity161 government more accountable to all of its people			0
progress may be slow , but thinking back on this project i 'm reminded of something @entity151 said while i was canvassing with him			0
" even if you convince one person , " he said , " that means you did make a difference			0
" thanks to all of you who were a part of that difference			0
we 'll do it again soon			0
* @entity179 nerd note : the voter turnout rates are rounded to one decimal place because of a margin of error associated with voting - eligible population data and with prison population estimates , @entity38 said			1
" really , all of it has a measure of uncertainty			0

in @entity0 and @entity1 , 44.2 % of voters cast ballots in november
the two states tied for the lowest voter turnout rate
@entity12 's @entity13 was trying to boost @entity0 's turnout
the state ranked 50th in 2008 ; it moved into a tie for 49th this year
