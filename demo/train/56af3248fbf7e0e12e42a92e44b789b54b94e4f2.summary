a day after @entity5 agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for lighter economic sanctions , the difference in the moods on the streets of @entity3 and @entity4 could n't be starker			1
" i 'm very happy about this agreement , " one man told @entity10 in @entity3			0
" we hope all the world knows we use this nuclear ( power ) just for peace , not for war			0
" with the exception of extreme hard - liners , most @entity5 are extremely happy with the deal , especially after many rounds of negotiations that yielded no results			1
@entity5 newspapers lauded the agreement , with one proclaiming on the front page : " this is @entity5 , and everyone is happy			2
" but just across the region in @entity4 , many residents echoed the sentiments of @entity32 prime minister @entity31 , who slammed the deal as " a historic mistake			1
" a political cartoon in one local newspaper depicts @entity32 's foreign minister as saying , " i 'll find us new friends " -- an apparent jab at the @entity41 and other allies that supported the deal			1
@entity32 team goes to @entity45 an @entity32 team headed by national security adviser @entity47 will leave soon for the @entity41 to discuss the agreement , @entity31 said monday			1
that plan was worked out in a conversation with @entity41 president @entity52 on sunday night , the @entity32 prime minister said			1
" i would be happy if i could join those voices around the world that are praising the @entity56 agreement			0
it is true that the international pressure which we applied was partly successful and has led to a better result than what was originally planned , but this is still a bad deal			0
it reduces the pressure on @entity5 without receiving anything tangible in return , and the @entity5 who laughed all the way to the bank are themselves saying that this deal has saved them			2
" the agreement , @entity31 said , " must lead to one result : the dismantling of @entity5 's military nuclear capability			1
i remind you that only last week , during the talks , the leaders of @entity5 repeated their commitment to destroy the @entity32 , and i reiterate here today my commitment , as prime minister of israel , to prevent them from achieving the ability to do so			1
" @entity3 has continued its incendiary statements against @entity32 even in recent weeks			2
during negotiations in @entity56 , @entity83 , @entity5 supreme leader ayatollah @entity81 said @entity32 officials " can not be even called humans " and referred to @entity31 as " the rabid dog of the region			1
" what the deal means @entity5 officials and the @entity92 countries -- the @entity41 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 -- hashed out the plan in @entity56 early sunday morning			2
even though it 's only a six - month deal , world leaders hope it 'll pave the way to a long - term guarantee that @entity5 wo n't produce nuclear weapons			1
and @entity5 hopes to recoup some of the billions of dollars it 's lost as a result of international sanctions			1
world powers will suspend sanctions on various items , including gold and petrochemical exports			0
that suspension will provide @entity5 with about $ 1.5 billion in revenue , according to the @entity115			2
@entity5 has stumbled from one economic crisis to the next under the sanctions , and unemployment currently runs over 24 %			2
but not every country is following suit			0
@entity122 foreign minister @entity121 said his country will maintain its sanctions on @entity5			2
" people of # @entity5 deserve freedom & prosperity denied them by regime 's nuclear ambitions , " @entity121 tweeted			1
" until then , @entity122 sanctions remain in full force			0
" ' most thuggish people ' it 's also unclear whether @entity134 will agree to the deal			2
sen. @entity136 , a prominent @entity137 on the @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , and @entity142 committees , called monday for a new round of sanctions that can be relieved only if @entity5 dismantles its plutonium reactor			1
the end game is to stop enrichment , he said on @entity10 's " @entity148			0
" " we 're dealing with people who are not only untrustworthy , this is a murderous regime that murders their own people , creates chaos and mayhem throughout the whole world , the largest sponsor of terrorism			0
and we 're treating them out of sync with who they are			0
that 's what bothers me so much			0
this deal does n't represent the fact we 're dealing with the most thuggish people in the whole world			2
" since the deal is temporary , it remains unclear what world powers might offer -- and demand of -- @entity5 in the future			1
" it 's a little too early to break open champagne bottles and put on the party hats on this one , " said @entity176 diplomatic expert @entity175			0
" its success hinges on whether or not it leads to a bigger agreement to " put @entity5 's nuclear weapons program to rest			1
" that the diplomats came to any accord at all represents a momentous budge in a nearly 35 - year deadlock marked by distrust , suspicion and open animosity between the @entity41 and @entity5 , which broke off diplomatic relations after @entity5 's revolution in 1979			1
it was the first such agreement in 10 years of attempts to negotiate over @entity5 's nuclear program			1
success or setback ? in a televised speech , @entity5 president @entity196 sold it as a win for his negotiators			2
" we are pleased after 10 years that an agreement on this level has been reached , " he said			0
he played up the fact that the deal allows @entity5 to enrich uranium to a level making it usable as nuclear fuel			1
during the six months of the agreement , he said , major facilities in @entity5 will continue doing so			2
but that level , 5 % enrichment , is well below the level needed to make weapons			0
@entity214 : what critics are getting wrong about the @entity5 deal @entity52 said the agreement includes " substantial limitations that will help prevent @entity5 from creating a nuclear weapon			1
" the president defended the interim deal , saying in @entity222 on monday that the @entity41 " can not close the door on diplomacy			0
" " tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically , but it 's not the right thing to do for our security , " he said			0
some @entity137 opponents in @entity45 agreed with @entity32 officials , saying the plan will actually help in @entity5 's alleged quest for a bomb			1
" this agreement shows other rogue states that wish to go nuclear that you can obfuscate , cheat , and lie for a decade , and eventually the @entity41 will tire and drop key demands , " sen. @entity236 of @entity237 said			2
@entity31 : obligation to defend @entity31 adamantly distrusts @entity5 and decried the agreement as a " historic mistake " sunday			0
now that sanctions are working , @entity31 wants to see them tightened , not loosened , until @entity5 shuts down much of its nuclear capability			1
the agreement does not apply to @entity32 , he said sunday			0
if need be , @entity32 will take matters into its own hands			0
" the regime in @entity5 is dedicated to destroying @entity32 , and @entity32 has the right and obligation to defend itself with its own forces against every threat , " @entity31 said			1
@entity32 president @entity258 backed up @entity31 , but also extended an olive branch			0
" i would like to say to the @entity5 people : you are not our enemies and we are not yours , " he said			0
" there is a possibility to solve this issue diplomatically , " @entity258 said			0
