@entity0 -- within 24 hours of @entity3 's death in a @entity5 assault on his compound in @entity7 , administration and government officials -- both cloaked in anonymity and on the record -- provided misleading if not erroneous information about what happened in the @entity17 leader 's final moments			1
@entity3 was shielded during the shooting by women , including his wife , they said			1
he was an active participant in an ongoing firefight , they insisted , implying @entity3 was armed and therefore gave @entity25 little choice but to shoot him down			1
hours later , a senior administration official began to revise that narrative to some @entity30 reporters			1
further revisions came tuesday when @entity30 press secretary @entity32 gave a step - by - step description of the raid provided by the @entity35 that made clear @entity3 was unarmed and had no human shields			1
live blog : @entity3 operation was it the fog of war , a bid to head off questions about killing @entity3 or perhaps a final propaganda salvo against the face of terrorism to @entity5 ? asked about the initial erroneous details , @entity32 shrugged it off as part of the difficulty in disseminating information quickly on a chaotic situation taking place halfway around the world			1
" what is true is that we provided a great deal of information with great haste , " @entity32 said , noting that some of the details came in " piece by piece " with frequent updates and elaboration			0
" we have worked very hard to declassify information in record speed to provide as much insight into this operation as we can , as quickly as we can , mindful obviously of the equities that are at stake here in terms of never revealing sources and methods , never compromising our intelligence procedures , " @entity32 said			0
however , his response failed to address why top officials including @entity78 , a seasoned intelligence professional not known for misstatements , would go public with erroneous information that seemed intended to further disparage @entity3			1
what @entity3 photos could show @entity78 was the first senior administration official after @entity83 's nationally televised statement sunday night to speak on the record to reporters about what happened in @entity7 , appearing at monday 's @entity30 news briefing with @entity32			1
he said then that @entity3 " was engaged in a firefight with those that entered the area of the house he was in , " adding that he did n't know whether or not @entity3 " got off any rounds			1
" @entity78 also said that during the assault " there was a female who was in fact in the line of fire that reportedly was used as a shield to shield @entity3 from the incoming fire			1
" he then urged the journalists to consider the bigger picture , seeming to mock @entity3 by saying he was " living in this million dollar - plus compound , living in an area that is far removed from the front , hiding behind women who were put in front of him as a shield			1
" @entity112 : @entity114 chief on why @entity7 was n't told it was n't just @entity78 saying it			0
a senior defense official gave a similar description to reporters at a @entity35 background briefing , saying @entity3 and other male combatants at the compound " certainly did use women as shields			1
" by tuesday , that narrative had changed			0
@entity78 , in an interview on @entity127 , backed off on the assertions that @entity3 was armed and had been shielded by women			2
" those details are still coming out , " he said when asked about whether @entity3 shot at the @entity5 assailants			2
" there was a firefight in the compound			0
and i would wait to make a determination about whether or not he was armed and whether he fired			0
" on the human shield question , he said at least two women in the compound , including a wife of @entity3 , " certainly resisted and they put themselves against the assaulters			2
" courier identified who led @entity5 to @entity3 " whether or not they were trying to shield or whether they were trying to attack is still unclear , " @entity78 said			2
@entity32 later gave reporters a step - by - step description of the assault that also changed the initial details			0
" on the first floor of @entity3 's building , two @entity17 couriers were killed along with a woman who was killed in crossfire , " @entity32 said			2
" @entity3 and his family were found on the second and third floor of the building			2
" @entity32 noted " there was concern that @entity3 would oppose the capture operation ... and indeed he did resist			2
" " in the room with @entity3 , a woman , rather @entity3 's wife , rushed the @entity5 assaulter and was shot in the leg but not killed , " @entity32 said			2
" @entity3 was then shot and killed			2
" @entity32 provided no further details on how @entity3 resisted			0
a @entity5 official speaking on condition of not being identified told @entity1 on tuesday that @entity3 was shot when he made a threatening move			1
when asked if @entity3 tried to grab a weapon or physically attack a commando , the official would only say : " he did n't hold up his hands and surrender			0
" @entity3 unarmed when killed , @entity30 says @entity114 director @entity177 , in an interview tuesday with @entity176 , said the @entity5 forces had clear authority to kill @entity3			1
" obviously , under the rules of engagement , if he had in fact thrown up his hands , surrendered and did n't appear to be representing any kind of threat , then they were to capture him , " @entity177 said , adding he was unaware of any verbal communication between @entity3 and the @entity5 forces but that " we 're still getting the feedback from the @entity25 themselves as to just exactly what took place during that mission			1
" to administration officials , the @entity5 forces acted properly			0
" it 's very difficult for us , from here , to monday morning quarterback a very difficult decision , " deputy national security advisor @entity193 told @entity1 when asked tuesday about @entity3 being killed while unarmed			1
" frankly , i do n't know , " @entity193 continued			0
" i 've seen differing accounts as we gather more information			0
i do n't know for certain whether @entity3 was armed or not			0
but i do know that our tremendous ... assault team that made that raid that day made exactly the right decision in each case , as far as i 'm concerned			0
" @entity32 acknowledged the difficulty in getting all the facts right in such a situation , telling reporters that " to use your phrase -- fog of war , fog of combat -- that there was a lot of information coming in			0
" the impact of the initial reports was clear			0
in opening a @entity30 subcommittee hearing tuesday on @entity7 , rep. @entity222 , @entity223 , mentioned the successful mission against @entity3			1
" that he reportedly died using a woman as a human shield is an image that cements the true nature of his character , and such cowardice will be a part of his legacy , " @entity222 said			0
@entity1 's @entity233 contributed to this story .			0
