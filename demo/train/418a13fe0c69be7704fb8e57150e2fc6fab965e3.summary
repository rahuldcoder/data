@entity0 -- whatever you think of his politics , house speaker @entity2 has a great sense of humor			1
so perhaps he wo n't mind the question framed this way : what happened , in the course of just one week , to make speaker @entity2 the miss @entity11 of immigration reform ? ( if i have lost you already , take a moment and search the @entity16 to understand the reference -- you wo n't regret it			1
) " never mind , " was the trademark closing line of a character the late @entity20 made famous as a cast member on " @entity22			0
" and " never mind , " is what @entity2 might just as well have said thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014			1
" listen , there 's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws , " @entity2 told reporters , suggesting @entity30 executive actions to change provisions of the health care law had many conservatives worried the administration would n't feel bound by any immigration legislation passed by @entity36			1
citing that trust deficit , the speaker added : " it 's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes			2
" there is without a doubt deep mistrust of the @entity49 @entity30 in the @entity51 congressional ranks			2
but is that mistrust any greater than just a week ago ? of course not , and it was just a week ago that the same speaker @entity2 said this of the same immigration debate : " this problem has been around for at least the last 15 years , it 's been turned into a political football			1
i think it 's unfair , so i think it 's time to deal with it			0
" to be fair , the speaker a week ago was candid about the disagreements and skepticism within the @entity51 ranks -- and among @entity51 base voters critical to 2014 midterm success			1
" that 's why , " he said a week ago , " doing immigration reform in a common sense , step by step manner helps our members understand the bite size pieces and helps our constituents build more confidence that what we 're doing makes sense			2
" but to that point , again just a week ago , the word from @entity30 @entity51 leadership aides was that @entity2 wanted to try to see if the @entity30 could act this year			1
and president @entity49 tried to create some space for compromise , angering some liberals by telling @entity1 's @entity88 he would not prejudge the final product -- opening the door to accepting a measure that provided legal status , but not a fast track , to citizenship for the estimated 11Â½ million undocumented immigrants in the @entity96			0
now , it appears testing that spirit of compromise will have to wait until 2015 or beyond			0
what changed in a week ? nothing , say key @entity2 lieutenants			2
they insist people , primarily immigration activists and the media , read too much into what the speaker said a week ago			1
" nothing ' happened ' per se , " a top @entity2 aide said in an e-mail exchange			0
" we just got started and getting started requires taking a sober view at the challenges that we face			0
all he did today was outline the challenges we need to overcome			0
" those challenges -- the trust deficit as outlined by the speaker -- are most unlikely to be overcome in a heated election year			1
veteran @entity51 strategist @entity119 , who for years has been urging the @entity51 to act on immigration , said the politics behind @entity2 's shift were easy to understand			1
" @entity127 would do would ever become law , " @entity119 said -- meaning that even if the @entity30 passed something , it was unlikely that differences with the @entity126 could be worked out this year			0
so a @entity30 debate now , @entity119 said , " would divide @entity51 and become a political weapon @entity130 could use against @entity51 in 2014			1
" there is no doubt a vocal slice of the @entity30 @entity51 conference was against acting on immigration this year -- arguing their biggest priority is turning out conservative base voters , many of whom view even legal status as amnesty			1
and on the @entity126 side , @entity51 leader @entity143 had already served notice he had little appetite for revisiting the issue in that chamber before the election			0
not only does @entity150 face a @entity152 primary challenge but , as we illustrated last sunday on " @entity154 , " most @entity51 strategists see action on immigration this year -- whatever the long - term good it might do @entity51 -- as potentially harmful to @entity51 prospects this year			2
the raw politics behind that view : in the 11 states where @entity126 seats now held by @entity130 that are top @entity51 2014 targets , conservative turnout is critical and the @entity167 population tiny to small			2
( @entity168 is lowest with just a 1 % latino population ; @entity170 is the highest at 9 %			0
) " @entity150 saying it was n't going to get done -- burst the balloon , " said @entity51 strategist @entity171 , another voice who consistently stresses the urgency of acting on the immigration issue , yet sees the short - term political rationale of waiting			2
so does @entity119 , again despite his longer - term worries about the @entity51 and the @entity167 vote			0
" right now , the spotlight is center stage on the @entity130 , the president and @entity184 , " said @entity119			0
" and the @entity51 wants to do nothing to distract from that , certainly not start a food fight on immigration			0

a week ago , house speaker @entity2 said he wanted to try to act on immigration
on thursday , @entity2 said it would n't happen this year
trust gap between @entity51 and @entity30 wo n't close in election year
immigration debate between @entity30 @entity51 would give @entity130 a weapon
