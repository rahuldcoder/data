the state passed a law in 2008 that was aimed at keeping predators from trolling the internet for new victims			0

state courts can impose limits on social media as a condition of a sex offender 's probation or parole , but a " blanket ban " on internet use violates the @entity30 's guarantee of free expression , the judges found			1

" if you want to follow the pope on @entity68 , you ca n't do that			2
" news websites increasingly require commenters to log in via a social network , and @entity52 said " @entity45 " could n't supervise his own child 's use of social media under the law			1
@entity2 attorney general @entity77 said his office has not decided whether to appeal the ruling			2
" the @entity81 made a policy decision in 2008 that the state 's reasonable interests in protecting children from predators outweighed the interest of allowing convicted sex offenders to troll social media for information , " @entity77 said in a statement issued by his office			1
" we have worked with county sheriffs and prosecutors in our defense of the legal challenges to these protections of our children , and we will need to review this 7th @entity15 ruling to determine the state 's next steps			0
