-- after just one season in charge at @entity4 , coach @entity1 has led the @entity6 side to the verge of @entity9 supremacy with a place in the @entity12 final			1
the 58 - year - old @entity13 will be hoping for his second victory in the tournament which he first won with @entity17 - based team @entity16 back in 1995 , when he goes head - to - head with @entity20 's @entity19 in @entity21 on 22 may			1
@entity1 will also be attempting to achieve the historic triple having already taken his team to the @entity24 title and to victory in the @entity26			1
things did n't begin so well for @entity1 's opening season at the @entity30 club though , and after almost crashing out of the @entity12 competition following two successive defeats to @entity34 , many fans would not have expected their team to reach the final stage			2
can @entity20 beat @entity1 to become king of @entity9 ? but many are now praising @entity1 for turning the clubs fortunes around , and neutrals are widely backing him to finish the job at the @entity42 on saturday			2
record @entity1 has won an impressive 18 titles from the four clubs he has managed over the course of his career and some of his greatest achievements arguably come from his time in charge of @entity16 in the mid 90 's			1
winning three @entity13 league and cup titles as well as the @entity53 in 1992 and @entity12 in 1995 , @entity16 were a dominant force under @entity1 's reign , providing the majority of players for @entity59 's national team			1
moving onto @entity60 in 1997 , @entity1 led the @entity62 side to two @entity64 titles			2
he finally left his position at @entity60 in 2003 after seeing through a brief spell as boss of the national side between 2000 - 02			0
returning to his home country , @entity1 went on to manage @entity70 , a team his steered to the league title in 2009 -- a feat he described as is his " most beautiful achievement " -- before leaving for @entity4			1
personality declaring himself as self - confident , arrogant , dominant , honest , industrious and innovative , at the press conference where he was unveiled as the club 's new coach , @entity4 boss @entity1 showed he was no slouch at self - assessment			1
such is the dedication he brings to his job , @entity1 famously shut himself away in a @entity6 monastery in 2009 to fast track his learning of the new language			1
however , @entity1 will undoubtedly always be remembered for his fiery temper which has seen him clash with some of his players in recent times			2
he famously let rip at @entity91 @entity90 who dared to sit down and take his boots of during a training session on a hot day last year and at @entity94 , who left @entity4 for @entity95 shortly after being reprimanded by @entity1 for falling asleep at a team lunch			1
but his meticulous and sometimes harsh style of management has also nurtured some major talents of the game			0
@entity1 oversaw the fledgling careers of players such as @entity103 and @entity104 at @entity16			1
previous clashes @entity1 has described his meeting with @entity107 in the @entity12 final as " @entity109 vs @entity110			2
" @entity20 was an assistant to @entity1 during his time at @entity60 in the late 1990 's , and has often described the @entity13 as his mentor			1
and @entity1 is full of praise for his former pupil			2
" i think i educated him a little			0
i could immediately see he had an understanding of the game			0
@entity20 was very modest back then			0
it was nice watching his development , to see that he has become such a personality			0
" it is thought that the pair communicate regularly via text message , but despite being friends they are rivals on the pitch			0
tactics given their history it is unsurprising the two men have a similar approach to the way they manage their football teams			0
however , @entity1 has been keen to point out the differences : " he trains to win			0
i train to play beautiful football and win			0
my way is more difficult			0
" @entity1 will have a full squad of players to pick from on saturday , with the exception of @entity90 who is suspended following a booking in the previous round			0
it is expected that @entity148 's @entity147 will replace him in midfield			0
fellow @entity13 @entity150 is also expected to play a big role in the match , as the forward is as keen as @entity1 to beat @entity20 , who he used to play under at @entity154 .			1
