-- the pictures of @entity3 's fish processing factory in northeastern @entity4 taken after march 11 , 2011 illustrate just how destructive the tsunami was			1
a ship was swept on to land by the giant wave and left stranded against the front of the factory , while entire sections of wall collapsed , leaving twisted metal and debris protruding from inside			2
@entity3 estimated the catastrophe caused us $ 19 million worth of damage to his business , @entity18 , which processes fish for major supermarket chains across @entity4			1
he was forced to lay off all of his 120 employees			1
" i set a goal right after the quake , " he said			0
" all the staff would be back by january 1			2
" @entity25 : share your stories about last year 's disaster three months after that deadline and he 's almost there			1
seventy are now back at work and he expects that number to rise to 100 by march			2
though he 's found many of his old employees , some have left the city all together to find work elsewhere			1
@entity3 is one of a small group of businessman determined to rebuild @entity40 , a city of around 150,000 on the coast of northeastern @entity4			1
the tsunami caused widespread damage here , knocking down homes and wiping out the fishing port and processing factories that account for 30 % of the jobs in the city			1
with no jobs and no homes , many have left for bigger cities like @entity54 or @entity55			2
the survival of the fishing industry here is deeply intertwined with that of the city itself			0
a year on and progress has been slow			0
@entity63 , president of the @entity64 is one of city 's most determined champions , spearheading the effort to create a newer and better port			2
he says fishing volumes are still at just a fifth of what they were before march 11 , and fisherman have nowhere to sell their catch without the processing plants			0
his biggest frustration is with the pace of the recovery			0
the national government insists on following the normal -- but lengthy -- approval process for the rebuilding plans , rather than fast - tracking proposals as an emergency case			0
" there is a huge gap between our feelings and those of @entity55 , " he said			0
only two weeks ago @entity40 's local government announced plans to rebuild the fishing industry at a cost us $ 1.5 billion , including support for small and medium fish processing plants			1
it will take three year to complete			0
@entity63 's vision for the fish market is even more ambitious			2
he wants to expand beyond the commercial auction and add restaurants to attract tourists , like similar sites in @entity103 and @entity104			0
as for the processing plants , @entity3 believes only two of his competitors are back in full operation			1
he says others have struggled to raise capital or to rebuild the land under their factories , which sunk a meter in the disaster			0
his hope is that @entity40 can attract investors to the rebuilding process so that people can be convinced to move back			1
for @entity121 , convincing people to stay and work in @entity40 is about more than saving the city he 's lived in for twenty years			1
it is less about money and more about saving a way of life			0
" if this industry is gone , people will have to go to @entity55 and they will be without a true home , " he said .			0

@entity40 was just one of many @entity4 towns hit hard by last year 's earthquake and tsunami
@entity3 was forced to lay off the 120 staff at his fish processing factory
but @entity3 is one of a small group of businessman determined to rebuild the city of 150,000
they are trying to attract investment in rebuilding to lure back residents who left the town
