-- do you get it ? translation : are you strategic ? how often have you overheard a group talking about a leader and saying , " she / he just does n't get it ? " do they say that about you ? a @entity12 survey of corporate human resources and leadership - development executives identified " strategic thinking " as the business skill most sought by organizations			1
so how can you continually hone your strategic - thinking skills in order to provide value to the organization and advance your career ? the fact is , most of us are now required to be more successful with fewer resources			1
let 's focus on the theme that 's at the heart of being strategic : differentiation			1
in order to realize our full potential , we must embrace the style that makes us unique -- whatever it might be			1
is our style quiet and introverted , or outgoing and extroverted ? do we thrive in an orderly , structured arena , or one that is constantly changing and requires a great deal of flexibility and improvisation ? success goes to those who are willing to be different in ways that bring value to others			1

the norm is an average , or a standard level			1
it 's where the majority of people wind up , even though there is no such thing as a " normal " human being			2
everyone has a unique style built on differences in background , abilities , temperament , and so forth			1
the difficult thing is uncovering and living that unique style			1
a manager whose products and services represent the norm for the industry may break even or make a modest profit			2
a person who lives by following the herd , and who is not willing to take the risks that will let his or her true gifts shine through , may be comfortable			2
but neither will ever know the exhilaration of finding what differentiates them and letting authenticity drive their individual success			2
we are all different from one another ; our strategies need to be different as well			2
strategy is inherently about doing different things than the competition or doing the same things in different ways than the competition			2
it 's not about being better , it 's about being different			2
@entity97 is often subjective : is blueberry pie better than lemon meringue ? it depends , but it 's definitely different and i can sell you on those differences			2
differentiation in the studio @entity107 artist @entity106 has taken a dramatic approach to art by performing it in a different way			1
he created a series of artworks in which dead animals ( including a shark , a sheep , and a cow ) are preserved -- sometimes after having been dissected -- in formaldehyde			0
while his artwork -- such as " the physical impossibility of death in the mind of @entity124 , " featuring a shark in a tank of formaldehyde -- caused great debate on what is or is not art , one thing ca n't be denied : his ability to differentiate himself and his work through a well - conceived strategy that has jolted the business world of art. @entity106 's different artistic activity has propelled him to become reportedly @entity107 's richest living artist , with his wealth valued at nearly $ 350 million			0
