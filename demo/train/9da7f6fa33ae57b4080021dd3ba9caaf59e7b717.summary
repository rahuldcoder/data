hundreds of demonstrators called on the government to reverse its decision to raise fuel and gas prices			0
riot police worked to break up the crowd , and most people fled			1
but a handful stayed and engaged in a standoff with the police , who fired tear gas canisters to try to force the demonstrators back			2

many say they 've never been so fearful about the future of their country			0
many believe that if the government does not reverse its decision , the kingdom will plunge into chaos			0
a wave of protests that began in @entity3 in december 2010 has recurred sporadically since			1
previously on @entity0 : thousands rally for political change in @entity3 while the demonstrators have often lambasted members of parliament , cursed the prime minister and called for the government to go , they 've rarely spoken out against @entity71 while those voices remain a minority , their call is growing as @entity3 throng to public squares to lash out against the government for cutting fuel subsidies , which resulted in higher gas prices			1
" @entity83 , do n't be fooled , look around and see what happened to your peers , " one crowd chanted with reference to toppled @entity82 autocrats			0

pain at the pump is a drag on government approval ratings anywhere			0
but in @entity3 , where the @entity111 has kept up the pressure on a monarch who is friendly to the @entity114 and a stabilizer in the @entity116 , a protest could have explosive potential with effects beyond @entity3 's borders			1
the @entity121 kingdom , which has good relations with @entity123 , is wedged among the jewish state , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , and serves as a buffer in the region			1
as in @entity131 , @entity130 hold powerful political influence in @entity3			1

@entity3 's teacher 's union announced an open - ended strike wednesday , saying it would last until the government reverses the price hikes			1
@entity3 demonstrators commonly voice anger about corruption and poverty , accusing those in power of misappropriating government money for personal gain			1
but as the streets filled , the rhetoric took a caustic turn , dropping the monarch 's title and referring to him crudely by first name only , a rare indiscretion in @entity3			1
" @entity179 , listen , listen very well , we will kneel to no one but @entity177 ! " was one chant , along with , " @entity177 is mightier than all tyrants			0
" insulting the king is illegal in @entity3 and can result in a prison sentence			1
@entity13 does not have a reputation for bloody oppression like @entity125 's @entity186 or former @entity188 dictator @entity187 , and is viewed by many as a benevolent king			2
he had 20 opposition activists arrested in early october but quickly released them after an international human rights group criticized the move			0
his recent announcements of concessions to protesters ' demands to democratize have not quelled discontent			2

he accused @entity130 of lying in wait for any opportunity to incite the collapse of a stable government			0
speaking of the @entity207 , he said : " they have been trying to mobilize their people in the streets and prepare themselves for such an eventful day			2
" he reminded them that they had shown no opposition when @entity131 's @entity214 president , @entity213 of the @entity215 , had to raise gas prices there			0
he then appealed to @entity3 not to " be influenced by these petty attempts			1
" @entity200 has blamed the gas subsidy cuts on budget slashing made necessary by the uprisings in neighboring countries , which have reduced the gasoline supply to @entity3			1
" in the past 18 months of the @entity111 , @entity3 has lost between $ 4 and $ 5 billion at least as a result of oil stoppage , especially the @entity131 gas supplies , " @entity139 quoted @entity200 as saying			1
it has put the country 's budget deficit through the roof , he said			0
in the past two years , @entity13 has fired four prime ministers			0
in february 2011 , shortly before @entity131 president @entity235 was forced out of office following weeks of intense protest , the king dismissed his government and ordered " genuine political reform , " the country 's royal court reported			2
political reforms would mean taking power away from his base -- the @entity245 tribes , a group known as the @entity247			0
on top of that concern , the king is also dealing with more than 200,000 @entity125 refugees who have entered @entity3 recently , fleeing despotism in the neighboring country			1
