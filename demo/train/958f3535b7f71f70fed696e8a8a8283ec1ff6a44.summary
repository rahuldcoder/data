mr. @entity0 would be so proud today			1
his voice -- the magnificent voice that he feared he had lost forever -- is back			2
and people all over the @entity3 are once again moved by the sound of it , and by his words			1
" and on the eighth day , @entity7 looked down on his planned paradise and said ' i need a caretaker			2
' so @entity7 made a farmer			2
" just as seemingly simple , and devastatingly direct , as that			2
" @entity7 said ' i need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt , and watch it die , then dry his eyes and say , ' maybe next year			2
' " you probably saw the commercial during the @entity20 telecast			2
it was on behalf of a @entity23 truck			1
the voice was that of @entity0 , taken directly from a recording of a speech he made in 1978 to the @entity27			1
mr. @entity0 died four years ago at the age of 90			1
i knew him for more than 30 years ; he always invited me to call him " @entity30 , " and i never quite could			2
he was mr. @entity0 , and for a very long time , he was as big a name as there was in the world of radio			1
his commentaries were heard everywhere			2
@entity36 : by the numbers , how has farming changed since ' @entity39 ' ? they were so popular because he was unafraid , even in the most cynical and contentious times , to speak from his heart			1
because of that , he had admiring listeners of every political persuasion ; his own politics were conservative , but because of the care and craftsmanship with which he wrote , people who did n't agree with him on issues of national policy made a daily habit of tuning in just because they liked the warmth and respect he showed them in his storytelling			1
they considered his voice to be the voice of a friend			0
" @entity7 said , ' i need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales , yet gentle enough to yean lambs and wean pigs and tend to pink combed pullets ; who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadowlark			0
' " the writing was what he took such pride in			1
he would begin well before dawn , in a quiet office above @entity75 in @entity76			0
he wrote on a favorite old typewriter whose touch he trusted			1
within the hour , the words -- punctuated by those wondrous silences between phrases -- would be heard in every corner of the country			0
they connected , person - to - person , with the intimacy of a whisper in an ear			0
truck ad stirs pride , passion and conversation in agricultural circles toward the end , illness ravaged his voice , and he was terrified that it had been irretrievably stolen from him			1
he was off the air for long spans			0
when he came back , the voice was still his , but it was weakened			0
the knowledge caused him great despair			0
he had two best friends in life			0
one was his wife , @entity106 , who died before he did			0
the other best friend was his voice			0
the thought of it , too , being taken from him made mr. @entity0 lie awake at night and pray			1
there that voice was again , sunday night			0
people too young to remember mr. @entity0 's glory days stopped what they were doing and leaned toward the television set , suddenly needing to hear every word			1
his artistry did that to people			0
" somebody who would bale a family together with the soft , strong bonds of sharing ; who would laugh and then sigh , and then reply , with smiling eyes , when his son says that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does -- ' so @entity7 made a farmer			0
' " mr. @entity0 would walk out of the studio after each broadcast , then go back into his office and sit down next to that typewriter			1
he knew that soon enough he 'd be at it again .			0
