in living rooms and in public spaces			0
in front of computer screens and in front of big screens in downtown plazas			0
to echo the national team 's mantra : they believed the @entity15 could win			1
their team did not , however , exiting the @entity17 in the knockout round after losing 2 - 1 to @entity19			1
but if anything can salve the wound of the @entity15 team 's elimination in the @entity17 , it 's how many in the country opened their eyes to soccer , as if for the first time			1
" our heroic display makes young @entity33 choose soccer over bball in @entity36 now ! " tweeted @entity29 , a late cut from the @entity15 national team			1
" @ ussoccer will be a real force			0
" time will tell if more @entity15 athletes turn to soccer -- or football as it 's known most everywhere else in the world -- over basketball , football or baseball thanks to the 2014 team			1
still , over the past few weeks , there 's no denying that the @entity15 ' performance has galvanized and , quite likely , created legions of fans			1
while ratings were n't immediately available for tuesday 's match with @entity19 , the @entity15 ' first - round match against @entity54 set a viewership record for @entity57 's coverage of @entity17 matches			1
their game last week versus @entity61 was the network 's second - highest rated @entity17 match			2
it 's not just that people watched , it 's how they watched			0

" watching some of the scenes back home has been incredible , " said @entity71 , who was named " man of the match " after his tremendous , although losing , performance			1
" it fills us with pride and inspired us to push forward and feel like we could actually could do something , special because the feeling , the passion back home , was second to none			1
" the growth of soccer in the @entity15 on the world stage -- in economics , politics or whatever else -- @entity15 are rarely underdogs			1
yet that was the case in the world 's biggest sporting event , especially after the team was put in what many called " the group of death			0
" the @entity15 was one of two teams to advance from that group , leading up to its game with @entity19			1
the @entity115 prevailed thanks to two goals in extra time -- after 90 minutes of scoreless regulation -- in what @entity15 head coach @entity119 described as both " a thriller " and " a bummer			2
" " the whole country and the fans that came down to @entity75 ; they can be proud of their team , " the @entity124 - born coach said on @entity57			2

we grew up a lot			0
" the same could be said of the @entity15 soccer program , generally			1
in many ways , this growth has been a long time coming			0
@entity15 @entity137 notes that there are more than 3 million registered youth players , compared to just over 100,000 in the mid- 1970s			2
that 's out of about 24 million players total , ranking the country second only to @entity143 in terms of participation by a single nation , according to @entity147			0
@entity148 has also seen a relative boom of late , with passionate fan bases in places like @entity152 and @entity153 , @entity154 , and games often attended by upwards of 20,000 people			0
still , some see soccer as a niche sport -- followed passionately , yes , but not by mainstream @entity15			1
the @entity17 , though , may have changed that			2
fans -- both new ones and diehards -- energized you could see the support at @entity168 's @entity167 , where thousands , some of whom admitted that they 'd played hooky from work , gathered to watch the game			2
the lakefront stadium is better known as home to the other game of football -- the @entity177 and its @entity178 -- but on tuesday , its gates were opened to the public			0
thousands of fans sat in the stands or stood on the gridiron , which was covered with a protective matting			0

@entity218 tweeted his congratulations on @entity220 , saying , " well done # @entity221 mde our country proud			0
" @entity218 has made his love for " football " known for some time			0
but what got many in the @entity15 soccer world so excited this summer was all those who usually do n't care about the sport following the game -- like one man who posted to @entity0 's match blog , " i hate soccer and yet here i find myself hanging on every post about the game			2
" a patron at @entity239 sports bar in @entity240 , @entity241 , remarked how soccer was once a marginalized sport in the @entity15 , but not any more			1
