-- as @entity3 finally calls time on his 17 - year professional career , @entity2 football can bask in the knowledge they boast the best two teams in @entity8			1
but while the @entity11 final between eventual winners @entity13 and @entity14 showcased all that is good about @entity2 football , the 36 - year - old has told @entity0 the domestic game may suffer as a result			1
as well as the continent 's most glittering club prize , @entity13 won the @entity20 and the @entity21 by an incredible 25 points			1
@entity14 , who won the championship in the previous two seasons , were their nearest challengers , and the pair have accounted for five of the last six titles			2
@entity3 told @entity29 that duopoly could be bad news for the @entity21 , if @entity2 's top league starts to resemble @entity32 , where @entity34 and @entity35 reign supreme			1
" in @entity2 we have a situation now where @entity14 and @entity13 are far , far more away from the other teams , and that 's what we do n't want to see in the @entity21 , " said @entity3 , who has 98 @entity2 caps to his name			1
" we have a little bit of a similar situation in @entity32 with @entity34 and @entity35 , and in the ( @entity46 ) @entity45 it 's more open			0
" these last years we could see a lot of surprises , and from the bottom ( a team ) could beat the first one			2
it was exciting and the @entity21 was good to see			2
@entity13 is heading away a little bit so we will see how it develops in the future			2
" @entity13 's historic treble confirmed them as the dominant force in @entity2 , and with their considerable financial muscle , they are already planning on extending their superiority over the rest			1
shortly before the end of the season it was announced that @entity65 -- one of @entity14 's best players -- would be joining @entity13 for $ 49 million , with striker @entity67 expected to make a similar move in the coming weeks			1
while the man who masterminded @entity13 's success in 2013 , @entity70 , is retiring , his replacement is @entity72 , who won a total of 14 trophies in four years as coach of @entity34			1
so how can the other teams , @entity14 included , keep up with the @entity13 juggernaut ? " with money , " @entity3 jokes			1
" no , it 's difficult for the weaker teams to close the gap because like i said , the bigger teams still invest , and they could invest			0
" if you take @entity13 , they just bought six months ago @entity85 for $ 52 million , now @entity65 for $ 49 million			2
so that 's a lot of money and it 's not possible i think to do it for any other club in @entity2			2
" it is just @entity13 who has this good position , and from a financial point really good , and really healthy			2
" @entity14 as well , they are trying to close the gap between them and the other teams , but of course @entity13 are far away from the others			1
" @entity72 comes with a reputation as one of the game 's leading coaches , but given the standards @entity13 set this season , @entity3 thinks the @entity107 will struggle to improve the team			1
" i think sometimes when you come in ( as a new coach ) you think ' i have to change something			0
' but if you see this @entity13 team now , i ca n't really see where he needs to change			1
" obviously he has his own idea of football and how he wants to play			0
i 'm sure he 's seen a lot of games , if not all , in the last six months from @entity13 , and he knows there 's not much to improve			1
" it 's an incredible level that they 've played in the last six months or the last year			2
and like i said before , the little details			0
maybe change something just to change something because you want to play your own style			0
" but on the other side , like i said , you ca n't really change a lot because everything works well			0
but i 'm sure he 's a smart guy and a good coach , and he will handle it			0
" @entity3 's farewell match in @entity134 saw a @entity135 , coached by new @entity137 manager @entity136 , take on a @entity138 , coached by @entity139			1
former teammates @entity140 , now at @entity142 , @entity144 @entity143 , @entity13 captain @entity145 and seven - time formula one world champion @entity146 , among others , took part			2
@entity136 managed @entity3 at @entity137 and has now returned to @entity150 for a second stint after his three - year tenure at @entity35 ended in disappointment			1
one of the @entity155 's first engagements will be to renew his rivalry with @entity72 when @entity137 play @entity13 in the @entity157 at the end of august			1
and @entity3 , who won one @entity45 title and two @entity160 in his four years at @entity137 , and three @entity21 crowns with @entity13 , says his time with @entity136 was a golden spell in his career			1
" he has a fantastic reputation at ( @entity137 ) , also i think in @entity46			0
he 's a charismatic manager and i really enjoyed working with him for two years and most of the players as well i can say			0
" i think ( his image ) is not always what you see in the media			0
what we have as players , is another picture			0
and that 's the picture in the dressing room			0
" it 's the daily work with him on the pitch and his speeches when he talks to us			0
and that 's what i can say is special , because his attitude , his personality , if he comes in front of the group if he talks to us			0
" what 's fantastic is he brought the team behind him			0
and that shows not just in @entity137 , he also adapted really well on the international ( stage )			0
he worked in @entity195 , he worked in @entity32 , and everywhere he had success			0

@entity3 tells @entity0 the dominance of @entity14 and @entity13 is bad for @entity2
two sides *contested* @entity11 final and are *streets* ahead in @entity21
the 36 - year - old says new @entity13 coach @entity72 has a tough *job* to improve the team
@entity3 played a farewell match in @entity134 as his 17 - year career *officially* came to an end
