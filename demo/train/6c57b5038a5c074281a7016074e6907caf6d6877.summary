@entity0 -- thirty years after hundreds died in a fight over the disputed @entity4 , the @entity6 president on thursday urged @entity7 to once again try to resolve the conflict -- this time , at the negotiating table			1
" we have to leave behind us this outdated story , this outdated history , and build a new history based on dialogue , " president @entity10 said at the @entity0 headquarters in @entity12 during a meeting of the world body 's decolonization committee			2
" we 're not asking that we 're told we are right , we 're just asking to talk , " she said			0
" we are not asking for anyone to say , yes , the @entity4 are @entity22 : we are asking for no more , no less , than to sit down at a table and talk			2
" @entity6 invaded the @entity4 -- known as the @entity4 in @entity6 -- in 1982 , prompting a war in which more than 600 @entity6 and 255 @entity7 troops died			1
following the war , @entity7 retained control of the islands , which are off @entity6 's coast in the @entity31			1
about 2,500 people from " over 150 nationalities " now live and work on the islands , in addition to 1,700 stationed at the @entity7 military 's @entity36 there , according to the islands ' government website			0
@entity6 has persistently criticized the @entity7 presence and has renewed its claims to the islands			1
but some @entity7 leaders have fought back , with prime minister @entity43 earlier this year describing @entity6 's stance as " far more like colonialism , because these people want to remain @entity7			1
" @entity47 , a member of the @entity4 legislature , told the @entity0 committee on thursday that @entity6 was not only trying to prevent people from exercising " our democratic rights , " but they were ignoring what transpired three decades earlier			1
" i accept that @entity6 has changed , and i am pleased that it has , " @entity47 said			0
" however , i do not understand how the government of @entity6 can absolve itself and its people from its recent past , while simultaneously seeking to punish and harm a small and peaceful @entity4 ' people for something it incorrectly claims to have happened almost two centuries ago			2
" the legislator was referring to @entity6 's claim that @entity7 forcibly wrested the islands from its control in 1833			1
an account by @entity7 foreign secretary @entity64 on the @entity4 ' government website claims that @entity7 first possessed the islands in 1765 -- decades before @entity6 achieved independence from @entity68 imperial rule			1
@entity47 insisted thursday that ' the islands were never @entity6 ( and ) no @entity6 were ever forcibly expelled from the islands in 1833			0
" yet @entity10 , in her passionate testimony thursday , insisted that @entity7 does not have a rightful , historical claim to the islands			0
and geographically , she said , it makes no sense			0
" how can it be claimed with 14,000 kilometers away , that this territory is part of @entity7 territory ? " she said			0
@entity10 also pointed to a host of @entity0 resolutions addressing decolonization			0
she suggested that it was no coincidence that these measures had had no effect on @entity86 's sovereignty over the @entity4			0
" in reality , what 's happening here is the @entity7 is benefiting from its privileged position as a permanent member of the ( @entity0 ) security council , " she said .			2

@entity6 's president tells a @entity0 panel : " we 're just asking to talk " about @entity4
she claims @entity7 's standing on the @entity99 has hindered *action*
an island legislator claims the @entity4 " were never @entity6 "
@entity6 invaded the @entity4 in 1982 , but they stayed under @entity7 control
