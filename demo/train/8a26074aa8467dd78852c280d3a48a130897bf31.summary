@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's government touted its military offensive to recapture @entity6 's hometown of @entity7 from extremists , with some officials taking to state - run television over the weekend to declare the army had defeated the @entity12			1
but those who live in the city nestled along the @entity15 , about 140 kilometers ( about 87 miles ) northwest of @entity0 , told a different story on sunday			0
" there are no @entity1 troops here , " one woman told @entity2 by telephone from @entity7			1
the only presence , at least in her neighborhood , is the " @entity12 state , " she said , referring to @entity12			1
the extremist group on sunday announced the establishment of a " caliphate " and the renaming of the @entity28 in @entity1 and @entity29 ( @entity12 ) to the " @entity28 " in a newly released audio message and written statement purportedly from the official spokesman of @entity12 , @entity33			1
he said " @entity41 " is the emir of the new caliphate , using his real name of @entity38 , but who is more commonly known as @entity40			0
the group 's statement said its flag flies from @entity46 province in @entity29 to @entity45 in @entity1			1
it is also called on @entity48 to swear allegiance to the caliphate , which means @entity12 state			1
@entity2 could not independently verify the authenticity of the message			2
witnesses : heavy shelling in @entity7 the woman in @entity7 , who asked not to be identified over concerns for her safety , said she could hear the sounds of a fierce battle , in the form of shelling , being carried out by both sides			0
a video posted on @entity65 appears to support her assertion			0
in it , a man gives a tour of the city to show , he says , that there were no @entity1 security forces on the streets on saturday -- the day @entity1 forces said they launched the offensive			1
on the video , the man can be heard repeatedly saying " june 28 , 2014 , " presumably to offer evidence of the date			0
the man says " thank @entity81 , @entity7 is safe and still in the hand of tribesmen and not troops of ' @entity85 , ' " a derogatory reference to prime minister @entity87 that refers to his death			0
the video also shows a concrete blast wall erected around government buildings being taken down			0
witnesses inside and outside of @entity7 said @entity1 forces were heavily shelling the city			1
two days ago , the air force dropped leaflets from helicopters , demanding resident leave the city " for their safety			0
" a large number of people have fled @entity7 for smaller villages to the north , according to witnesses , who say @entity1 forces are battling @entity12 on the southern edge of the city			1
at the same time , state - run @entity1 tv showed video footage of large plumes of black smoke billowing from the city			1
another video , released by the @entity114 , showed @entity1 troops and convoys loaded with heavy weapons driving through the desert			1
the video was titled " cleansing the road between @entity121 and @entity7			0
" @entity2 can not independently confirm the claims			2
possible turning of the tide for @entity1 forces ? @entity1 security forces were routed by @entity12 fighters earlier this month during a lightning advance that saw the @entity130 offshoot seize large swaths of northern and western @entity1			1
state - run @entity132 reported that the @entity1 army and volunteer militia groups had cleared @entity12 fighters from the city , having advanced on the city from four directions			1
@entity139 , a key tribal leader in @entity7 , told @entity2 on saturday that the @entity1 security forces entered the city supported by special forces and fighters from among the local tribes and had gained control			1
he said @entity12 fighters retreated in the direction of @entity146 and the province of @entity148			1
but a combatant told a @entity2 freelance reporter that @entity12 fighters remained in control of @entity7 , though there were fierce clashes in an area about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) from the city center , toward @entity121			1
two security officials in @entity121 told @entity2 that @entity1 soldiers stopped the militants ' advance about 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) south of @entity7 because @entity12 had planted mines and booby - trapped houses			1
state - run tv aired footage sunday of the arrival overnight of five @entity167 fighter jets			0
they are the first of 25 warplanes expected to be delivered under a contract agreed to by @entity171 and @entity0 , the @entity114 said in a statement provided to @entity2			2
the announcement follows a comment by @entity87 that militant advances might have been avoided if @entity1 had proper air power , in the form of fighter jets that @entity1 has been trying to get from the @entity179			2
" i 'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract " with the @entity179 , @entity87 told the @entity180 in the interview last week , which was released friday			0
@entity1 has now turned to @entity184 and @entity185 to buy fighter jets , he said			2
" @entity81 willing , within one week , this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists ' dens , " he said			0
@entity179 officials were quick to reject @entity87 's complaints			0
@entity179 fighter jets have not been slow in coming , @entity193 spokesman rear adm. @entity192 told @entity2			2
the first two promised f - 16s " were n't expected to be delivered until the fall , which is still months away , " @entity192 said			0
" and we were in the process of working towards that delivery			0
" the advance of the @entity130 splinter group " could n't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes , " he said			0
@entity87 's statements about the need for air support came as @entity179 and @entity208 diplomats told @entity2 that the @entity179 is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the militant group , the @entity12 , and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in @entity1			1
@entity213 : @entity1 helped create this problem @entity213 spokeswoman @entity215 told @entity2 that @entity1 helped create the crisis			1
" this kind of blame of others on the outside is quite frankly part of what 's gotten @entity1 into the situation it 's in today			2
it 's helped create the crisis			0
when we left @entity1 , we gave the @entity1 the ability to create a better future , " she said			2
" and unfortunately , leaders across the spectrum did n't step up and take the opportunity			0
they blamed others and did n't bring the country together			0
" @entity87 and his @entity236 - dominated government have been under pressure by the @entity239 and @entity208 diplomats to be more inclusive of @entity1 's @entity241 minority , who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process by the government			1
@entity245 said that the @entity241 tribes in and around @entity7 were not aligned with the government or with @entity12 and had stayed out of the fight until now			2
but , he said , when @entity12 fighters who arrived in @entity7 robbed banks and carried out executions , as well as bringing the local economy to a standstill , the tribal leaders offered their help to the @entity1 security forces poised outside the city			1
the tribal leaders shared their knowledge of the city , including routes and known @entity12 positions , he said			2
also , @entity263 has reported the discovery in @entity7 of two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of @entity1 soldiers , police and civilians killed by @entity12 and its militant allies			1
in addition to the alleged executions in @entity7 , reports continue to emerge of atrocities committed by both sides			0
@entity263 , citing displaced residents and local activists and journalists , said saturday that @entity12 fighters kidnapped at least 40 @entity279 , dynamited four @entity236 places of worship and ransacked homes and farms in two villages just outside @entity285			1
the few @entity241 villagers who remained in @entity289 and @entity290 told those who fled that at least some of the kidnapped @entity279 had been killed , the rights group said			0
however , they had not seen bodies and could not give more information			0
@entity12 destroyed seven @entity236 places of worship in the predominantly @entity299 city of @entity300 , about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) west of @entity285 , earlier in the week , @entity263 added , citing local sources			2
but the allegations of atrocities are not just limited to @entity12			0
@entity304 has said it has gathered evidence pointing to a pattern of " extrajudicial executions " of @entity241 detainees by government forces and @entity236 militias in @entity300 , @entity285 and @entity311			0
maps : understand the crisis in @entity1 what is @entity12 ? @entity1 witnesses recall horrors in @entity300 , @entity285 @entity2 's @entity317 and @entity318 reported from @entity0 , and @entity319 reported from @entity320			1
