@entity0 is often described as " the third rail of @entity4 politics " -- touch it and you 'll get zapped			1
so why do @entity6 keep sidling up to it and sticking their fingers out ? there 's a brewing controversy in @entity11 over a small part of the program , which is just the latest version of an old routine that goes like this : @entity6 say @entity0 is going broke , and they propose changes that would cut benefits or otherwise undermine the program			1
@entity19 shout " republicans are trying to cut @entity0 ! " then the @entity6 , scared of a backlash from older voters , back off			1
and why do we keep going through this ? republicans will tell you it 's because the program is in peril , and if we do n't cut it back , it wo n't be there at all for future generations			2
democrats will tell you it 's because @entity6 never liked the program in the first place , and would love to kill it			1
that may be an exaggeration , but the fact is that @entity6 hate big government , and government does n't come any bigger than @entity0			1
it 's also the most successful and beloved social program in @entity4 history			0
most of us are too young to remember when growing old in @entity4 almost inevitably meant a miserable descent into poverty , but until the middle of the 20th century , that 's what it was			0
the current controversy revolves around a rule change @entity6 made as soon as the new @entity11 was sworn in this month			1
@entity0 is actually two separate programs , @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , and the much smaller @entity58 ( @entity58 )			2
the disability program will be facing a funding shortfall next year , and to ensure that disabled people continue to get all their benefits , @entity11 would have to move some money from @entity57 into @entity58			1
this is n't anything new -- it 's been done many times in recent years			0
but @entity66 @entity6 adopted a parliamentary rule barring the @entity66 from allowing that transfer unless it was accompanied by benefit cuts or tax increases			1
if it ca n't get worked out , people on @entity58 could see their benefits cut substantially			0
so why would @entity6 insist on this ? my guess is that they think forcing a mini-crisis over the @entity58 's finances will allow for a debate on the program that will make it easier to do what they 've wanted to do for a long time : cut it back somehow , either by reducing benefits , increasing the retirement age , or even partially privatizing it			1
the justification is always that the program is " going broke			0
" but that 's just not true			0
when people say that , what they 're usually referring to is that , according to the projections in the @entity96 ' latest report , in 2033 the program 's trust fund will be exhausted			0
but even if there are no changes between now and then , the program would not be " broke			0
" that 's because it would still be taking in billions of dollars in taxes every day and paying them out in benefits			2
even under this scenario , the program will still pay 77 % of recipient 's benefits after 2033 , according to the report			2
that would be a large reduction in income for millions of seniors			0
but 77 % is not nothing			0
the people who tell you that the program will be " broke " are hoping that , faced with that ( fictional ) nightmare , you might be willing to accept steep benefit cuts now			0
but we do n't have to -- the projected shortfall can be fixed with some very modest changes , like raising the payroll tax cap ( right now you only pay payroll taxes on the first $ 117,000 of your wages , which means that the wealthy actually pay less as a proportion of their income than the rest of us ) or gradually raising the payroll tax by a point in tiny increments over an extended period			0
the point is , it would n't be hard to come up with some combination of changes that could take care of the shortfall without cutting benefits			2
but for that to happen , both parties would have to agree on that goal			0
and there 's reason to wonder whether @entity6 really want a @entity0 that 's strong and stable			1
programs like @entity0 and @entity146 -- which provide vital benefits to millions of @entity4 and are hugely popular -- stand as a living rebuke to conservatives ' small - government philosophy			1
when republicans tell voters that government ca n't do anything right , they hope that the voters do n't respond , " well , the government is doing a good job keeping my grandma from having to eat cat food			0
" the idea that the program is perennially in crisis , on the other hand , validates everything else that @entity6 say			2
@entity11 will probably work out the issue with @entity58 funding , just like they have in the past -- once the @entity6 starts feeling some political heat over it			1
but @entity6 will be back for another attack on @entity0 soon enough .			1

@entity174 : rule change adopted by new @entity6 @entity11 could end up cutting @entity0 disability benefits
he says it 's part of @entity6 's perennial attack on @entity0 as *unsustainable* , but there are better ways to fix
