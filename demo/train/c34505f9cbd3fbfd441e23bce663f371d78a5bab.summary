@entity0 -- in an " unprecedented " reaction to internal @entity6 affairs , an @entity3 official said the country is getting ready to absorb fleeing @entity9 alawites if the @entity11 regime falls			1
@entity3 military chief of staff @entity15 told members of a @entity14 committee that @entity8 would be permitted to settle in @entity19 , a spokesman for @entity14 member @entity13 told @entity1			1
the @entity19 is regarded internationally as occupied territory despite @entity3 governmental control			1
it is home to 41,000 residents -- @entity26 settlers , @entity27 and @entity8 themselves			0
@entity3 seized the territory from @entity9 during the 1967 @entity3 - @entity6 war , and it was eventually annexed			1
the remark reflects the @entity3 military calculus that the embattled @entity11 regime is doomed and will soon disintegrate			2
the regime is dominated by @entity8 , a heterodox offshoot of @entity35			0
@entity36 represent the most populous religious group in the country and the heart of the opposition against the regime			0
for this reason , @entity3 believes @entity8 are most likely to flee if a new government takes over , and many will head for the @entity19			1
so , @entity3 authorities want to prepare for that eventuality			0
@entity47 at the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity3 , said defense minister @entity50 also predicted late last year , to the same parliamentary panel , the foreign affairs and defense committee , that the fall of the @entity9 government is imminent			0
within weeks , he said			0
@entity47 said the notion of taking in uprooted people from a neighboring @entity6 country is a drastic deviation to conventional @entity3 policy , which traditionally calls for @entity3 not to get directly involved in such situations			1
he said it 's the " first time @entity3 ever said anything of this kind			2
" " it 's quite strange to be honest with you in terms of @entity3 's more usual style , which is we do n't get involved in the affairs of neighboring @entity6 countries , " @entity47 said			1
@entity47 said he does n't know on what @entity3 is basing its evidence			0
he said information he and other civilian researchers have culled indicates that the assessments are " very premature " " these latest statements seem to factor in this sense , which is the @entity3 military intelligence assessment that this regime is clearly on its last leg , " @entity47 said			2
" @entity3 talk of needing to look immediately at what 's going to happen when @entity11 falls very soon is somewhat premature unless they know something that the rest of do n't -- which is possible			0
