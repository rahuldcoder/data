-- the @entity1 passed a bill wednesday that would curb the collective bargaining rights of public workers and strip away their power to strike			1
lawmakers approved the measure by a count of 17 to 16 , with six republicans voting in opposition			1
the bill , known as @entity12 , is supported by @entity13 governor @entity13			2
it would curb a 1983 @entity16 state law that affords collective bargaining rights to public employees			1
" no surprise , " said @entity1 president @entity19			1
" i 've been saying for weeks that we have the votes to pass this bill			0
it reflects the diverse interests that our members have around the state of @entity16 , " he said			0
the near - 500 - page proposal was modified tuesday with @entity30 - supported amendments cobbled into a single omnibus package			2
modifications include new measures to settle workplace arbitration , limits on worker vacation and an end to their ability to negotiate health care and automatic pay raises based on seniority			0
the amended legislation would also restore collective bargaining rights on wages but ban strikes by all public - sector workers , imposing fines and terminating employment contracts for those who defy the ban			1
@entity52 lawmakers described the proposal as union - busting			0
their @entity30 counterparts argued that it 's needed to tackle an overreach of union influence they regard as an impediment to fiscal reform			2
" it passed by the most narrowest of margin , " said @entity52 state senator @entity61			0
" that really shows how much public outcry on this bill			2
that they can change a 27 - year - old law in three weeks is scary			0
" meanwhile , protesting crowds gathered in @entity70 , @entity16 , chanting slogans like " shame on you ! " following the @entity1 vote			2
earlier wednesday the measure sailed through a @entity76 following a last - minute @entity30 shuffle that resulted in the replacement of @entity79 senator @entity79			1
@entity79 said he mostly supported the bill , and the need for collective bargaining reform , but disagreed with a provision that would allow employer management to " impose its will on the final terms of the contract when fact - finding and mediation fail			1
" " that violates the fundamental principle that one can not be simultaneously a judge and an advocate in his own cause , " he said , calling for an " elected , independent , neutral " party to adjudicate those cases involving state workers			0
the bill now moves onto the @entity30 - controlled @entity99 where lawmakers are expected to take up the measure on march 10			1
@entity16 , often considered a battleground for presidential politics , faces an $ 8 billion shortfall in the next two - year budget			0
