in one of the most anticipated @entity3 hearings in years , the justices on tuesday offered sharply divided views on the controversial individual mandate provision at the heart of the 2010 federal health care reform law			1
the fate of the individual mandate -- requiring most @entity10 to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a financial penalty -- may be in jeopardy , and perhaps with it the entire law 's other 450 or so sections , based on tough questions of the government by the court 's conservative majority			1
@entity21 , @entity22 's senior legal analyst , said questions asked at oral arguments often show how justices are thinking , and based on what he heard tuesday , the health care reform law could be in " grave danger			1
" neither the justices nor the lawyers arguing before them mentioned " @entity31 " -- as opponents have labeled the law pushed through @entity34 by @entity35 and president @entity36 -- or the president by name			2
but the court seemed fully aware of the landmark consequences of their eventual rulings			0
" those who do n't participate in health care make it more expensive for everyone else , " said justice @entity42 , in support of the law			1
" it is not your free choice " to stay out of the market for life , she said			0
hear tuesday 's oral arguments @entity55 , mostly healthy people who would be the " subsidizers will become the subsidized " when they grow older , added justice @entity54			2
however , justice @entity58 said that the federal government " is telling an individual he has the obligation he must act " and purchase insurance			1
" that threatens to change the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way , " @entity58 said			1
if @entity34 could regulate health care in the name of commerce , added chief justice @entity72 , " all bets are off " on a range of areas subject to federal oversight			1
monday roundup : 90 minutes of lively debate tuesday 's argument was the biggest of the high court 's three - day marathon this week examining the limits of congressional authority			2
it was part legal seminar , part history lesson , with politics sprinkled throughout			2
at least 17 members of @entity34 attended , along with several members of the @entity36 administration , including attorney general @entity90			2
administration officials , speaking on condition of not being identified , said they expect the high court to uphold the individual mandate despite the tough questioning tuesday			1
read a transcript from the courtroom they noted conservative judges who asked similarly challenging questions as the issue made its way to the @entity3 ended up upholding the mandate , and that @entity72 targeted both sides with his queries			2
outside the court , dueling news conferences and protests tuesday reflected the partisan nature of the health care debate			2
rep. @entity111 of @entity112 , who failed in her bid for the @entity115 presidential nomination to take on @entity36 in november , told tea party supporters near the @entity3 building that the issue is freedom for individuals to decide their health care needs			1
" if the federal government can tell you , when you are not doing anything , that you must do something , then the federal government can tell you anything , " @entity111 said , later adding a call for the @entity3 to declare the mandate unconstitutional			1
sen. @entity128 , a @entity129 @entity115 , said he was " optimistic " the court would strike down the mandate because he saw @entity58 was " highly skeptical			1
" " can the federal government force @entity10 , free @entity10 to buy a product ? " @entity128 said			1
" that 's really what this boils down to			2
this is a very basic issue of freedom			0
i would say four conservative justices , three of them spoke and they were highly critical of this claim			0
" sen. @entity141 , a @entity142 @entity115 , called it the " most important decision probably in two or three generations			0
" the @entity3 and election - year blockbusters earlier , a cancer patient said at a news conference held by supporters of the law that it saved her life			2
" because president @entity36 signed the @entity31 , i get to keep my house , i wo n't go bankrupt , my kids are going to get to go to college , and i am going to live , " @entity154 said to cheers			0
the nine - member bench kept tuesday 's two hours of arguments focused on the constitutional and policy implications			2
@entity22 poll : most want health law modified , not scrapped at issue : may the federal government , under the @entity169 's commerce clause , regulate economic " inactivity " ? three federal appeals courts have found the @entity31 to be constitutional , while another has said it is not , labeling it " breathtaking in its expansive scope			1
" that " circuit split " all but assured that the @entity3 would step in and decide the matter			0
a coalition of 26 states , led by @entity181 , argues individuals can not be forced to buy insurance , a " product " they may neither want nor need			0
the @entity186 has countered that since every @entity10 will need medical care at some point in their lives , individuals do not " choose " to participate in the health care market			0
federal officials cite 2008 figures of $ 43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services -- costs that are shifted first to insurance companies and then passed on to consumers			1
in court , solicitor general @entity199 struggled to articulate the government 's position that the mandate regulates commerce that already exists because everyone -- whether or not they currently have health insurance -- participates in the health care market			1
justice @entity209 jumped in , asking @entity199 : " why do you define the ( health care ) market that broadly ? " " it may well be that everybody needs health care sooner or later , but not everybody needs a heart transplant , not everybody needs a liver transplant , " @entity209 continued			0
" could you define the market so that everybody has to buy food sooner or later , so you define the market as food , therefore , everybody is in the market ; therefore , you can make people buy broccoli ? " @entity72 said the law covers pediatric care and drug treatment , but not all @entity10 would need them and would indirectly subsidize them			0
but justice @entity231 said the federal government 's economic oversight is broad , " true of almost every product , directly or indirectly by government regulation			1
" " there is government compulsion in almost every economic decision because the government regulates so much , " @entity231 added , calling it " a condition of life that some may rail against , " but the reality nonetheless			0
@entity42 , meanwhile , made the correlation between health care reform and @entity248 , passed in the 1930s to give a financial boost to older citizens , that is subsidized by young and old			0
" if @entity34 could see this as a problem when we need to have a group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get the benefits , it seems to me you are saying the only way that could be done is if the government does it itself ; it ca n't involve the private market , it ca n't involve the private insurers , " @entity42 said			0
a @entity22 / @entity266 poll released monday indicated that the health care law is growing in popularity , especially among independent voters , but half of those questioned still oppose it			1
however , while most opponents of the measure believe it goes too far , some who disapprove think it 's not liberal enough			0
the poll found an almost even split on the individual mandate , with 47 % in favor and 51 % opposed , a gap within the survey 's margin of error			1
according to the survey , a gender gap exists on the issue , with 58 % of men opposing the mandate while 53 % of women support it			0
in addition , a stark partisan divide exists on the issue , with 71 % of @entity35 favoring the mandate while 78 % of @entity115 oppose it			0
among independents , 56 % oppose the provision			0
@entity295 : what if the new health law is killed ? the opposing sides do not even agree on what the mandate -- known as the " buy in " or " minimum coverage " provision -- was designed to accomplish			1
supporters see it as a way to spread health care costs among a larger pool of individuals , ensuring affordable , quality medical care			2
they say regulating commerce and the economy has long been a federal prerogative			0
opponents see fundamental constitutional violations , such as an intrusion into a citizen 's personal life and an intrusion in long - held state power			0
most individuals would be covered under the mandate , except for those whose religious beliefs would conflict , as well as illegal aliens and inmates			0
it would fall on insurance companies to inform the government of those covered under their health policies			2
10 things you might not know about health care law it is the individual mandate that has sparked the most controversy			1
it requires nearly every @entity10 to purchase some level of insurance or face a tax penalty of up to about $ 700 a year			0
on monday , the justices quickly bored of the dense legal argument presented on whether the individual mandate was a " tax , " which would put off consideration of the larger constitutional questions for another few years			1
few on the bench seemed eager to embrace that go - slow approach , and some justices began asking questions about tuesday 's argument on the individual mandate			1
two families , two viewpoints on health reform that shows where the court 's real focus lies , knowing its ruling on the mandate key question will have enormous legal , social and political implications			1
tuesday 's case was @entity362 v. @entity181 ( 11 - 398 )			0
oral arguments conclude wednesday with two hearings on whether the entire law should collapse if the individual mandate is found unconstitutional , and whether the separate expansion of @entity368 is unduly burdening the states			1
rulings on all four issues taken up by the court are expected by late june .			0

administration officials say they expect the mandate to be upheld
@entity22 's legal analyst says the individual mandate appears to be in " grave danger "
@entity58 : it could " change the relationship between the government and the individual "
