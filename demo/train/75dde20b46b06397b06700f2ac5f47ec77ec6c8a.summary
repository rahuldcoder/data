@entity0 -- it began with scant details released by the military about a heinous allegation : a soldier slipped away from a remote outpost in southern @entity8 and went on a shooting rampage at nearby villages that left 17 people dead			1
the questions were immediate : what was his name ? what was he doing at the outpost ? where did the military take him ? the answers from the @entity22 military were slower in coming , and the dearth of information fueled angry accusations by @entity8 of a cover - up , with president @entity27 at one point accusing the @entity22 military of withholding details and refusing to cooperate with @entity8 investigators			1
" the @entity22 military justice system is unfamiliar territory to most @entity22			1
so we should be hardly surprised that @entity8 view it with skepticism , " said @entity34 , a former judge advocate who teaches military justice at @entity36			1
part of the issue is differing cultural and social practices			0
but the larger problem , @entity34 and other legal experts say , is perceived missteps in a number of high - profile war crimes cases and the closed culture of the military itself have led to a lack of confidence -- whether justified or not -- in the military justice system			1
critics are questioning the military 's ability to conduct the transparent , speedy investigation demanded by @entity8 in the case , which has roiled relations between the two countries and intensified the debate about withdrawing troops ahead of the 2014 deadline			1
one way to improve people 's perception of the system , @entity34 said , " would be a greater transparency for some of the decision makers			0
" the military 's blackout on details surrounding the @entity8 case is typical of the lack of transparency			1
it was through media leaks the world first learned the identity of the accused soldier and that he had been whisked out of @entity8			1
the military initially refused to release the information , citing security concerns			1
only after the leaks did the military confirm that @entity87 staff sgt. @entity86 , 38 , was being held in connection with the killings			1
" that 's not the military justice system			2
that 's some administrative decision unrelated to the justice system , " said @entity92 , a retired @entity93 judge who teaches military justice at @entity95			2
@entity98 believes the military 's actions were an attempt , " however wrong - headed , " to do the right thing			2
but it is that very attempt that has made it more difficult for the military			2
as it begins legal proceedings against @entity108 , the military is under the most intense scrutiny it has faced since soldiers were accused in 2004 of abusing @entity112 detainees at @entity114 prison , and a squad of @entity93 were charged with killing two dozen civilians in @entity117 , @entity112 , in 2005			1
eleven soldiers were court - martialed for their roles in @entity114 , though only three received prison sentences of more than a year			0
in the @entity124 case , charges were dropped , dismissed or reduced against all but one @entity93 , sgt. @entity125 , who was convicted of one count of dereliction of duty after a plea deal was reached in january in the case			1
in @entity8 , the negative perception of the @entity22 military has been exacerbated by a video that surfaced in january showing @entity93 urinating on the bodies of slain @entity8			1
the @entity93 at the time said it would investigate the actions , and news reports last month indicated defense secretary @entity139 was briefed on the findings , but the @entity141 has yet to release any details			2
cases like these define the @entity22 military for many @entity8 , said @entity144 , executive director of the @entity146 - based @entity145			1
" i was talking with @entity8 officials a few weeks ago about how they view the @entity22 military			1
they said they understood that the @entity22 tries not to kill civilians , but all of them noted three things that stand out to them : @entity117 , @entity114 and urination on dead bodies , " @entity144 said			0
" it 's a shame , " she added , because the @entity161 - led @entity160 " has gotten much better about civilian casualties , but these are incidents that civilians remember			0
" @entity34 said @entity124 , @entity114 and other high - profile cases have a " cumulative effect " for the public , even though the cases are very different from one another			0
" the mere fact that prominent cases are perceived to have several times fizzled or all but fizzled , it is not surprising that it leaves people in other countries less than fully nourished , " he said			0
attorney @entity173 , who participated in the defense of @entity125 , dismissed criticism in the @entity22 and abroad that there is an appearance the military protects its own			2
" the military will prosecute cases that nobody else will touch , " said @entity173 , a retired @entity93 lawyer who now works as a civilian defense attorney			2
" there are no financial constraints , no political constraints			0
they are insulated from that			0
" at the same time , however , military courts are insulated from the transparency the public demands from state and federal courts			2
in civilian cases , everything from the police investigation to the naming of a suspect to the release of court transcripts is often available for public consumption			0
in the military , the same material is sometimes withheld because of operations or security concerns , though more often than not it 's more a matter of the military 's discretion			0
" it 's easy for those of us who have worked in the system to have a lot of confidence in the system			0
we 're looking at it as insiders to our own system , " said @entity216 , a retired @entity87 judge advocate lawyer and vice president of the @entity219			1
military justice is designed to be a tool for a commander to maintain good order in the ranks , @entity216 said			0
it 's the commander who will decide the charges , where a case will be tried and other details			1
the problem of perception arises , he said , when commanders do not explain " their actions , their reasoning , their processes , their thoughts on a particular case			0
" " that 's a culture that 's beyond military justice			0
that 's a military culture , " he said			0
retired military judge @entity98 said it is that very reason that " the mentality in the military " must change so that clarity and transparency are viewed as a benefit rather than an obstacle			0
" and yes , sometimes it means we are going to take our hits , " he said .			0

the dearth of details from the military about the case is fueling @entity8 anger
legal experts say the military needs to be more transparent with the case
@entity87 staff sgt. @entity86 faces charges of murder , attempted murder and assault
