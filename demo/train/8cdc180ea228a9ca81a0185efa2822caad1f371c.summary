-- president @entity2 's trip to @entity3 this week comes amid accusations the @entity5 has hidden the results of a study that concludes textbooks in the @entity9 remain rife with @entity11 extremism			1
since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , successive @entity14 administrations have attempted to curb @entity3 indoctrination of students through hateful extremist material in its textbooks			1
in addition to teaching the material to its own students , @entity3 runs academies in about 20 countries , which use some of the same texts			2
the @entity9 has repeatedly claimed that it has revised its textbooks			0
in 2005 , the @entity3 government took out a full - page ad in the @entity26 to boast of its success at " having modernized our school curricula to better prepare our children for the challenges of tomorrow			2
" but the @entity32 said on tuesday the secret study finds @entity3 textbooks still " create a climate that fosters exclusivity , intolerance , and calls to violence that put religious and ethnic minorities at risk			1
" citing sources familiar with it , the @entity42 - based think tank said the @entity2 administration decided not to publish the study when it was completed in late 2012 because offensive material dehumanizing @entity47 and @entity48 included in the textbooks would portray the @entity3 in a negative light			1
" the @entity5 is in possession of a uniquely exhaustive set of recent findings about incitement in @entity3 's education system , findings that it has declined to release for public consumption , " the report said			2
the study is the product of a reported $ 500,000 @entity5 contract with the @entity60			0
on its website , @entity60 says the project was commissioned to " assist in the ongoing effort by @entity3 to remove discriminatory content from its public school curriculums and to evaluate its global impact in other muslim - majority countries			0
" current and former @entity14 officials said the study paints a mixed picture of @entity3 textbooks			1
while it notes some progress by @entity3 in making reforms and removing some of the most hateful language , the study still found areas for improvement			1
" we know there 's more work to be done , " @entity5 spokeswoman @entity75 said			0
@entity79 , a @entity3 scholar who runs the @entity42 - based @entity80 , has been studying @entity3 textbooks since before the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity79 said that in meetings with @entity5 officials over the years , he has found a consistent reluctance to put pressure on the @entity3 royal family about the problem			0
" i wrote papers and offered advice			0
i provided them with the textbooks showing evidence that the @entity3 have not done anything , " he said , adding that several officials warned him his campaign could damage @entity14 - @entity3 relations			1
" the @entity14 confronts @entity98 and @entity99 about human rights , but i do n't know why they ca n't tell the @entity3 to clean up their act on this issue , " he said			0
" the @entity14 is not a small country like @entity105 with no tools to force change			0
so either they are not serious or their policy is a failure here			0
if the @entity14 wanted to bring some pressure , they can			0
" @entity75 said the @entity14 has consistently and publicly encouraged @entity3 to institute educational and textbook reforms , but disputed the notion that the @entity5 had ever planned to publish the study			1
" it was intended to drive and inform the work of the @entity5 as we work with the @entity3 government to push them to reform their textbooks , " @entity75 said			2
" we obviously continue to push our partners to reform , and we believe with the @entity3 that it 's most effective to do this directly , with them , between our governments , and not publicly , and we do want to keep working with them to see if they can reform their curriculum more			0
" @entity131 , a senior fellow at the @entity32 who wrote the study , said @entity3 teachings of intolerance should be on the agenda when @entity2 visits the @entity9 this week			1
" the hate speech so rampant in @entity3 textbooks should be publicly addressed by the president while in @entity140 , " @entity131 said			1
" doing so would put hardliners on notice that even at this low point in @entity14 - @entity3 relations , the president will not shy away from affirming pluralistic @entity14 values and seeking reforms in the name of our national security			2
" opinion : why the @entity3 unfriended the @entity14			0
