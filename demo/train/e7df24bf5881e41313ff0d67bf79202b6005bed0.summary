-- the past few days have been difficult for @entity1			1
his setbacks include the release of a secret video in which he said 47 % of @entity6 thought of themselves of victims ; the news that his campaign is not as cash - stashed as some had anticipated ; and the latest poll numbers that show president @entity12 widening his lead in some swing states , including @entity15			1
the smart money is betting on @entity12 to capture a second term , and it 's easy to see why			1
he leads most major public opinion polls nationally and in the key swing states , and he has many more paths to a majority of 270 in the @entity23			0
the probability is that @entity12 will emerge with a victory			1
but we 're six weeks out			0
theoretically , a lot can happen , some of it driven by the candidates and their campaigns			0
could smart decisions , combined with a few favorable circumstances , propel @entity1 to an upset victory ? we can all come up with fantastical scenarios involving international or domestic crises that would cause a plurality of @entity6 to say " no more four years " for the president			1
occasionally , these things happen , as they did to first - term @entity41 president @entity40			2
a dramatically shrinking economy , sky - high interest and inflation rates and the agony of the @entity47 hostage crisis swamped his ship of state in 1980			0
but let 's be more realistic			2
from now until @entity53 , @entity1 's chances to surprise us will largely be dependent on the debates as well as his ability to better capitalize on the relatively weak economy			1
@entity57 knows @entity1 has been practicing enough for the three debates scheduled to be held october 3 , 16 and 22			2
inevitably , the @entity59 has some zingers prepared that will bring down the house -- well , the @entity59 side of it			0
opinion : @entity59 risk being the party of mean the key is to weave a larger narrative about what he will assert are " @entity12 's broken promises and failures " that can persuade the nation to do what it has been historically reluctant to do : send an incumbent packing			1
@entity1 has to employ outrage to energize his base yet use a tone that communicates more sorrow than anger that " it just has n't worked out as we had all hoped it would four years ago			2
" @entity84 scored a knockout in his 1980 debate with @entity40 , and @entity87 landed enough hard punches to stun president @entity89 in 2004 's first debate			0
can @entity1 measure up ? and can the debates become intriguing enough to draw an audience that consists of more than confirmed @entity59 and @entity41 partisans who tune in to cheer for their side ? it 's not easy to do in a polarized year when voters are dug in and as many as 95 % of those who will cast a ballot have made at least a tentative presidential choice			1
aside from the debates , @entity1 's best path to triumph is to portray himself relentlessly as an exceptionally qualified " mr. @entity103 " on the economy and to make hay of the economic reports still to come , assuming they contain bad news			1
growth is still very slow , and the unemployment picture is unlikely to brighten before the election			0
the final jobs report will be released on the friday before the tuesday election ; a disappointing number could enable @entity1 to win over a disproportionate share of the remaining undecided voters , though there might be few left			1
he might benefit from the news media 's desire for drama			0
even though @entity59 see the news media , on the whole , as biased toward @entity12 , most journalists are n't keen on a cut - and - dried presidential contest			2
opinion : why do the @entity129 pay so little in taxes ? for ratings purposes , if nothing else , they want a close , competitive race where the momentum goes back and forth			0
otherwise , it will be 40 days and nights in the desert , much like it was in the numbing , dramaless 1996 match - up between president @entity140 and his @entity59 challenger , sen. @entity141			0
to win against the rising odds , @entity1 and his team have to exceed expectations in many ways and run the near - perfect campaign that has eluded them so far			1
that 's very hard to achieve , but @entity6 electoral history is dotted with astonishing comebacks that defied the predictions of experts			0
it is not impossible that 2012 could record yet another			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			2

@entity157 : the past few days have been tough for @entity1 's campaign
@entity157 : the smart money is betting on @entity12 to capture a second term
he says smart decisions and luck might be able to propel @entity1 to an upset victory
