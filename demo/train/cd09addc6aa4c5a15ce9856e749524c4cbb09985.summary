-- what a difference 24 hours makes			0
@entity2 unanimously won the @entity4 nomination for @entity7 's 7th @entity6 seat at the party convention last weekend			1
that 's because no one else wanted to run against rep. @entity11 , the second most powerful @entity12 in the @entity13			1
but after @entity11 's shocking defeat in his primary tuesday against political novice @entity17 , @entity2 's candidacy has a whole new meaning			1
@entity4 have a bit more hope in this @entity12 district , now that the upstart @entity23 is up against an upstart @entity12 -- both of whom are professors at the same college			1
" now it 's going to be a grass - roots race to get out their base , " @entity27 , press secretary for the @entity28 , said			2
@entity2 is not your average politician			1
he works a small family farm , where he lives with his wife and seven children			0
he teaches disability studies and is director of @entity40 at @entity41 , a small liberal arts school outside @entity42 that has just over 1,000 students			1
he is a prolific writer , author of more than 20 books , both fact and fiction , including a children 's book			1
his latest tome is about the @entity7 slave trade and he is currently writing a novel about vampires			1
a @entity55 buff , he has also written dozens of columns on the @entity55 for the @entity57			0
while his bio says he worked for @entity60 's presidential campaigns in @entity61 , he is a political amateur			0
his online political presence is minimal			0
his @entity64 account is brand new and has two tweets			0
his campaign @entity67 page was built monday , after he won the @entity4 nomination			2
on the page he received advice from supporters , suggesting he build a campaign website and include a " donate now " button			0
others suggested he lose his facial hair			0
by the morning after @entity11 's defeat , @entity2 heeded the advice of his supporters			1
he was able to put up a campaign website , which is still sparsely populated and only includes a three - paragraph bio , an e-mail signup to get involved , and that essential button for contributions			0
the @entity28 is shielding @entity2 from the press for now , intercepting his media requests and offering surrogates instead			2
the academic has a lot to learn and not a lot of time			0
but his statement after the @entity12 primary results indicates he 's a fast learner , as it echoed the message of national @entity4			1
" i am running because i believe @entity98 are hungry for a radical change from the dysfunctional and reckless politics being practiced by those in @entity102 -- and the results of tonight 's primary election are the proof , " he said in a statement after @entity17 's insurgent victory			0
the 7th district is very conservative , with the @entity107 maintaining its political rating as solid @entity12			1
but with two political novice college professors running against each other , anything could be possible			0
with @entity17 's victory , the impossible has already happened once in this district			2
@entity11 loses primary in big upset ; @entity115 avoids runoff @entity11 ' earthquake ' rattles @entity118 opinion : who said the tea party was dead ?			2

@entity2 is the @entity4 *challenger* in @entity7 's @entity123
he is a college professor from @entity41 college
he has never run for office but has written *21* books
the district is solidly @entity12 but @entity11 's defeat shook the district
