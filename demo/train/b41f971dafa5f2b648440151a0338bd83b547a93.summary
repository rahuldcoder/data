trust is , supposedly , the new currency of the sharing economy			2
it drives , to excuse the pun , data intensive sharing companies like @entity7 , the controversial transportation sharing startup now valued at $ 19 billion			2
uber drivers get reviewed and are dismissed if they score badly and are considered untrustworthy			1
even uber users get scored by drivers and might not get picked up if they are n't well reviewed			1
everyone gets rated on @entity7			2
everyone , that is , except senior @entity7 executives themselves			2
last friday night , at a dinner party set up by @entity7 as an off - the - record briefing , at @entity20 's exclusive @entity19 bistro , @entity21 , the company 's vice president of business , proposed a dastardly scheme to compromise one of @entity7 's leading media critics			1
@entity21 suggested that @entity7 use its vast collection of consumer data to " dig up dirt " on @entity30 , the founder of the @entity32 news site @entity33			1
over a dinner attended by leading technology pundits , @entity21 suggested that @entity7 could spend " a million dollars " to hire a crack team of researchers and journalists			1
this investigative team might , he said , snoop into the personal and family life of a critic like @entity30 who has relentlessly exposed many of @entity7 's creepiest features -- particularly what she calls the " asshole " misogyny of its ceo , @entity46			1
earlier this week , @entity21 's outrageous and perhaps even criminal idea was leaked by the @entity51 editor - in - chief @entity50 , who attended the dinner			1
this , of course , has generated a massive storm of outrage amongst the technorati			2
@entity57 told @entity58 that @entity7 was the most " ethically challenged " company in @entity32			0
while @entity61 's @entity60 rhetorically asked whether @entity7 is @entity32 's " worst company			0
" all over social media , people said the same thing : @entity21 was the ultimate creep ! the crowd had spoken			1
@entity21 's reviews were universally abysmal			1
he should be yanked , dismissed , fired			2
but that 's exactly what has n't happened			0
in spite of the popular outrage over @entity21 's behavior , @entity46 wrote an unapologetic 12 part @entity75 " apology " which rejected the idea of firing his most senior business executive			1
uber investors have mostly remained conveniently silent with a few -- like the normally outspoken @entity79 -- explicitly defending @entity46 and , by implication , @entity21			1
in @entity84 , his brilliant satire of technology companies like @entity7 , @entity81 coined the orwellian phrase " sharing is caring " to describe the hypocrisy enveloping @entity32			0
but , of course , in the sharing economy of multi-billion dollar start - ups like @entity7 , sharing is only caring when it comes to dismissing lowly drivers or customers			0
@entity95 is only the convenient new currency of this economy when it suits @entity7			0
otherwise the " new " economy appears to be ominously old , with a rejection of transparency , democratization , openness , accountability and all the other buzzwords of the @entity106 revolution			0
we the people , however , may have the last laugh			0
the @entity111 ' @entity110 wrote that @entity7 's " toughest challenge " now is improving its dubious ethical behavior			0
while @entity114 , the ceo of @entity115 and a deep thinker about business ethics , notes that the principle challenge now of a successful startup like @entity7 is to scale its morality			2
" in the past , technology entrepreneurs created and sold devices , " @entity114 says			0
" today , they create and sell platforms for human behavior , which in turn raises real questions about the social and moral implications of the behavior -- and their underlying values -- on their platforms and about the responsibility that they have for these behaviors			0
tech entrepreneurs are obsessed about scaling their business models and products			0
but they should be just as , if not more , deliberate about scaling their values on their platforms and in their companies			0
" @entity46 should listen to critics like @entity114			1
if @entity7 is to succeed , it needs to scale its morality in sync with its fast - growing business			0
firing @entity21 would be a beginning			1
it would say that @entity7 really is a trustworthy company			0
it would tell the world that @entity7 , and @entity46 himself , is beginning to grow up .			1
