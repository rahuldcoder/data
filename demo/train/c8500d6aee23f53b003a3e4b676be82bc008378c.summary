-- take the magic of the " @entity3 " novels , add in a story of forbidden love like " @entity6 " and you have what publishers hope is the makings of another blockbuster in " @entity12			1
" the new novel tells the story of two young magicians , @entity16 and @entity17 , forced to compete in an elaborate duel , but who instead fall in love			1
set in the 19th century , the story plays out within the black and white striped tents of " @entity23 " an enchanted circus of dreams , which travels the world and is open only at night			1
it 's made up of acrobats and animal trainers , a tattooed contortionist and amazing displays , including a garden of ice and a maze made of clouds			1
like the story , the writing is magical and mysterious , the characters cryptic and compelling			1
overall it 's an enchanting page turner , a modern fairy tale readers are sure to fall in love with			1
but is it the next " @entity3 " ? publishers and booksellers are betting on it			1
@entity46 won a bidding war for the book			1
the publisher gave author @entity50 , a first - time novelist , a high six - figure advance and ordered a first printing of 175,000 copies			1
rights have sold to 30 foreign publishers			1
@entity56 , the @entity57 company behind the hugely successful " @entity6 " series , snapped up the film rights			1
@entity60 , the producer of the " @entity3 " movies , is in negotiations to lead the big screen adaptation			1
desperately in need of a hot seller , stores across the country and around the world are planning publication day parties for the book 's release on tuesday			1
the elfin - looking @entity73 is helping build buzz for her book , attracting huge crowds at @entity78 in @entity79 and @entity81 's @entity80			1
she recently signed 2,200 first editions to be sent to stores across the country in what she called " signing - palooza			1
" she 's heading out on a six - week , 14 - city tour to promote the book			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity50 ; the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : tell me about the inspiration behind " @entity12			1
" @entity94 : it kind of came about by accident , i was actually working on a different book			1
i started doing national novel writing month about eight years ago and i started writing this @entity99 inspired plot			1
i did n't know where i was going with it , so i decided to send all the characters to the circus			1
i started with these little vignettes and it did n't have a plot for the longest time , but that 's kind of where it started			1
it 's been a long strange trip			1
the idea came together in 2006			1
i worked on it in fits and starts and did n't take it real seriously at first			1
i was n't thinking at that point about trying to get published , i was writing just to write			2
then in 2008 i started to think i might have something			2
i tried to make the story a little more book shaped , not so sprawling and nonlinear and more resembling a novel			2
then i started querying agents in 2009 and got a lot of favorable responses but pretty much everyone said it had no plot			2
so i ended up doing a lot of revising and that 's actually the version of the book that ended up getting me signed			2
then i did even more revisions			2
this book has been revised many , many , many times			2
it 's changed so much that i did n't i feel like i was working on one book for that long because i was n't working on it continuously and because it changed so much			2
@entity0 : are you a fan of the circus ? @entity94 : i 'm not really a circus fan , not a traditional circus person			2
my background is in theater			2
i have a degree in theater from @entity148 and i like immersive performance , halfway between theater and performance art. i thought a circus environment would be an interesting venue to explore , where you did n't just have one tent with three rings and a show going on but where you could explore different things in different tents			2
@entity0 : on your website you say , " all my works are fairy tales in one way or another			2
" how so ? @entity94 : i like that " once upon a time " quality , where the telling of a tale has an elevated sense of story			2
there 's a whimsical quality to it			2
sometimes in fairy tales more things seem possible , even though often they 're real world based			2
i love that very traditional fairy tale where it 's not all " happily ever after			2
" i like all that old school , bloody , " @entity182 " sort of stuff			0
so you have all those shades of gray in there			0
@entity0 : this is your first novel , it 's generating a huge buzz , and i know you were a big hit at the @entity80 and at @entity78			0
@entity94 : i did go to @entity78 and it was amazing			0
there 's quite a contrast between the @entity80 and comic con			0
i did n't expect the expo to be as overwhelming as it was			0
i had a great time but the lines for my signing were around the entire convention center			1
i just never expected that sort of response			0
then @entity78 was just craziness			0
it was a lot of people and color , and loud , it was such a sensory overload			0
it 's been a lot of fun , but it was good that i had just a crazy few days and then i got to have some time off and recover			0
@entity0 : how are you enjoying the reaction to your book so far ? @entity94 : it 's been fun , but it does seem very big , especially for my first book			0
there are days where it 's just a little overwhelming , but the response has been great , especially within the book industry			1
i 've been getting letters from booksellers saying how much they love my story ; it means so much to me			0
after all the bells and whistles and @entity78 , and all the big stuff , really the fact that individual people are reading it and loving the book is just the best thing			0
one of the nicest things i 've heard , though , i 've had a couple people say to me this is not a book for everyone , which i really like , because i do n't particularly think there are books for everyone			0
i think this is the sort of story that resonates particularly strong with certain people and maybe not as much with others			0
i think that 's a hallmark of a really good story that it has readers that it speaks to more than others			0
@entity0 : there are plans under way to turn your book into a movie			0
how is that going ? @entity94 : i 'm a little bit involved			0
i 've heard bits and pieces ; they 're still in the early stages of production , trying to assemble the best team to put the film together			0
everyone is so enthusiastic and really loves the book , so it seems like it 's in really good hands			0
so i hope they can take the book and make it stand alone as a film			1
i do n't want to have that much input anyway ; it 's not really something i do			0
i 'm interested but i definitely just want them to run with it			0
@entity0 : do you have any actors in mind for key roles ? @entity94 : the only character i ever pictured as a particular actor , @entity282 was always @entity285 in my head			0
there 's something about his physicality and @entity285 's mannerisms that i pictured			0
he 's good in everything			0
@entity0 : what 's next ? @entity94 : i 'm going to be very busy with the book 's release but when i have time i am working on a new book			0
it 's very different but i 'm looking forward to exploring someplace new			0
i need to live in the world of story for awhile before i figure out the shape of the book			0
it 's sort of a film noir with influences from " @entity307 , " so it has a sort of fantastic feel , like the magic of " @entity12 " but with a little more ' 30s , ' 40s , ' 50s art deco feel to the story			1
@entity0 : will you ever return to " @entity12 ? " @entity94 : i do n't think it will become a series , a direct sequel or anything like that , but there 's a lot more material floating around the edges			1
there are lots of little tangential stories that could become part of a prequel , or collected short stories			0
i think that would probably be the extent of it but it would be fun to play with			0
there 's a lot more material on all the side characters that did n't make it into the finished book			0
