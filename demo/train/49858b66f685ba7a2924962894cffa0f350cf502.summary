@entity0 -- after months of stalemate , the @entity2 late tuesday passed a huge government spending bill that includes billions of dollars requested by president @entity5 to continue the war in @entity7			1
@entity9 officials have said president @entity5 would sign off on the spending plan if the @entity7 money was added			1
the roughly $ 555 billion bill -- which passed 76 - 17 -- also preserves thousands of earmarks for lawmakers who will deliver them to constituents just in time for the holidays			1
the final vote came at about 11 p.m. et tuesday -- after hours of debate that included two more attempts by @entity22 to tie war funding to a plan to withdraw @entity26 troops from @entity7			1
those efforts failed , as have dozens of others in the @entity9 and @entity2 since @entity22 took control of @entity30 last year			1
earlier , members voted to add $ 40 billion for the war in @entity7 that had been removed by the @entity9 -- which passed the spending bill on monday			1
the plan also includes $ 30 billion for troops in @entity35			1
sen. @entity36 , an independent from @entity37 who co-sponsored the push to reinstate the @entity7 money , called its approval " a very powerful bipartisan message of support for our men and women serving in @entity7			2
" @entity9 officials have said @entity5 would sign the spending plan if the @entity7 money was added			1
in the weeks leading up to the vote , @entity5 had repeatedly pushed members of @entity30 to approve a military spending bill that did not place troop - withdrawal requirements on the military in @entity7			2
the bill wraps together 11 of the 12 government spending bills for 2008 -- except for that of the @entity56 , which was already funded			0
facing a president determined to keep spending in check and a unified @entity61 minority in the @entity9 and @entity2 , @entity22 have been stymied at nearly every turn in their attempts to increase spending on their domestic priorities			2
fearing a politically dangerous government shutdown , @entity67 leaders ultimately gave in to @entity5 's top line number and trimmed $ 22 billion from the measure			2
but @entity22 stemmed their losses somewhat by shifting some funding from the president 's priorities to their own			0
and they added billions more above @entity5 's top line in " emergency " funding for veterans health care , @entity80 fires , border security and more			0
the government spending watchdog group @entity83 , which scrambled monday to pore over the nearly 1,500 - page bill that was made public late sunday night , said it has identified almost 9,000 earmarks worth $ 7.4 billion			1
many of the earmarks avoided normal congressional scrutiny and were " airdropped " -- or slipped in without going through normal committee consideration -- into the final bill , the group said			0
but sen. @entity92 , @entity93 , chairman of the budget - writing appropriations committee , said the spending plan represents a dramatic decrease in pork - barrel projects from the one approved by @entity5 two years ago -- when republicans controlled @entity30			0
" the total dollars that are earmarked is reduced -- hear me now -- by 43 percent , " @entity92 said tuesday from the @entity2 floor			0
" that ai n't chicken feed			0
" arguing for a plan that would have begun pulling troops from @entity7 within 90 days , sen. @entity103 , @entity104 , became emotional as he called the @entity5 administration 's efforts in @entity7 " a continuing quagmire			2
" " the best way to end this charade and protect our troops and our national security is to put the @entity7 on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future , " @entity103 said			0
" unless there 's a binding timeline for the redeployment of our troops , the @entity7 will not feel the need to make the compromises essential for a political solution			0
" the measure now goes back to the @entity9 for approval in its revised form			1
house speaker @entity131 said she expects the bill to pass the @entity9 , although she will vote against it because of the war funds added in the @entity2 version			0
