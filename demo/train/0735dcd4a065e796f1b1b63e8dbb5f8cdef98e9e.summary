rep. @entity0 might have to decide which job he wants more -- running the powerful @entity2 or running for president in 2016			1
@entity2 @entity4 adopted a new rule that could force @entity0 's hand as he considers his future			1
the new provision requires any @entity10 chair who decides to seek higher office to turn in his or her gavel			2
the @entity15 @entity4 is viewed one of his party 's top policymakers			0
@entity0 currently serves as the @entity20 chair , but is seeking support for the post as the head of the tax writing panel in 2015 , and is expected to get the nod next week			2
@entity0 has made no secret that he views that post , which would make him the lead to craft health care changes , tax reform and other major legislation , as his dream job			1
the former 2012 @entity4 vice presidential nominee has also left the door open to a bid for the 2016 presidential ticket			0
although the rule was n't directly aimed at @entity0 , his name mentioned when the proposal came up for a vote inside a closed door meeting on friday			1
according to one @entity4 source familiar with the discussion , he was present for the discussion , but there was n't any extensive debate about the change			0
@entity0 's office declined to comment on the new rule			1
@entity51 rep. @entity50 drafted the proposal in response to a situation that developed last year when @entity56 rep. @entity55 , who chaired a key appropriations subcommittee , ran for @entity58 , according to two @entity2 @entity4 sources			2
@entity55 presided over the panel that drafts the annual budgets for @entity63 and @entity64 agencies , but failed to pass a bill through his committee because he was focused on his campaign			0
@entity55 did n't win the @entity4 @entity58 nomination , and @entity50 and other members on the @entity66 , felt that the lack of action hurt the overall effort to put together the full series of funding bills for the year			0
the new rule does come with an out -- @entity0 could seek a waiver from leaders if he decides to run for president but wants to retain his chairmanship			1
given his close ties to house speaker @entity82 and others , it 's likely he could get one .			0

rep. @entity0 is *pursuing* the chairmanship of the @entity2
a new rule would *prevent* holding that job and running for president
the chairmanship has long been considered @entity0 's dream job
@entity0 could seek a waiver to hold to his position if he were to run .
