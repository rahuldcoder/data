@entity1 's parents brought him to the @entity2 from @entity3 nearly two decades ago			2
he 's been waiting for a green card ever since			0
but there 's one thing the undocumented immigrant no longer has to wait for , according to a @entity10 @entity9 ruling on thursday : his law license			1
@entity1 can be admitted to @entity10 's state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there , the court ruled			1
the landmark case quickly caught the eye of activists on both sides of the national immigration debate			0
@entity1 , 36 , says his @entity2 dream has finally come true			0
" with tears in my eyes i 'm happy to report i am being admitted to the bar , thank @entity29 ! " he said in a @entity23 post thursday after the court 's ruling			0
" this one is for all of you who dare to dream and by doing so change the world ! love you all ! history was made today ! " but the case raises many questions , particularly among those who have been critical of @entity1 's efforts to practice law			1
" how is @entity1 supposed to uphold ' the laws of the @entity2 ' when he is , by his mere presence in this country , in violation of federal law ? " @entity48 contributor @entity46 asks in an opinion column he wrote on the case in september			2
" how does he pledge to show respect for ' the courts of justice ' when , for most of his life , he has lived here in defiance of the rule of law ? and how can he claim that he wo n't ' mislead ' a judge or judicial officer when living in the @entity2 illegally requires deception on a daily basis ? " @entity10 's @entity9 ruled thursday that no state law or public policy should stop @entity1 or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state			1
immigration officials would be unlikely to pursue sanctions against an undocumented immigrant who had been living in the @entity2 for years , had been educated in this country and whose sole unlawful conduct was his presence in this country , the court said in a unanimous ruling written by chief justice @entity76			1
" under these circumstances , we conclude that the fact that an undocumented immigrant 's presence in this country violates federal statutes is not itself a sufficient or persuasive basis for denying undocumented immigrants , as a class , admission to the @entity88 , " the court ruled			1
a lengthy legal battle @entity1 was born in @entity3 in 1977 and taken to @entity10 by his parents when he was 17 months old , according to court documents			1
he remained there until 1986 , when he and his parents returned to @entity3			0
eight years later , at age 17 , @entity1 again returned to @entity10 with his parents and without documentation , though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the @entity2			2
that year , @entity1 's father filed an immigration visa petition on his son 's behalf , which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995			2
but , 19 years later , the visa has not been granted , even though @entity1 has lived in the state since 1994			0
" because the current backlog of persons of @entity3 origin who are seeking immigrant visas is so large , as of the date of this opinion -- more than 19 years after @entity1 's visa petition was filed -- a visa number still has not become available for @entity1 , " the @entity9 's ruling said			1
the ruling marks the end of a lengthy legal battle for @entity1 , who received a law degree from @entity118 in 2009			2
that year , he passed the @entity10 bar exam			0
for about two weeks , @entity1 was sworn in as an attorney			0
then he received a notice from the state bar that his admission was in error			0
" it was very , very hard for me to have to tell my family that the celebration we had meant nothing , " @entity1 told @entity127 in september			0
" it killed me inside to tell them that i really was n't a lawyer			0
" the matter ended up in the @entity10 state court system , and @entity1 earned the support of @entity10 attorney general @entity137 , who wrote in a 2012 brief : " admitting @entity1 to the bar would be consistent with state and federal policy that encourages immigrants , both documented and undocumented , to contribute to society			1
" the state bar argued that @entity1 had met all of @entity10 's requirements for a law license			1
" with today 's ruling , the @entity10 @entity9 reaffirms the @entity155 ' finding as not a political decision but rather one grounded in the law , " @entity151 president @entity150 said in a written statement thursday			1
case could set precedent critics have argued that giving @entity1 a license would n't make sense			0
how can someone without legal status become licensed as a lawyer , whose job entails upholding the law ? @entity168 , former prosecutor for the @entity151 , said @entity1 should n't be given his law license because his immigration status would be in violation of a civil immigration statute and could affect his ability to represent his clients			1
" in the immigration debate , we must separate the individual from the idea			0
the individual -- @entity1 -- looks like a keeper			0
the idea -- that one who has lived most of his life outside the law can practice law -- is problematic , " @entity46 wrote in his september column			2
the executive director of the @entity188 , which favors tighter immigration restrictions , said the case is part of a troubling trend			1
" the ruling that an unlawful immigrant can be admitted to the practice of law in @entity10 is the kind of thing that will light up talk - show switchboards , and rightly so			1
but beyond the @entity204 nature of the decision is a broader issue , " @entity199 wrote in an editorial published on the @entity202 's website			0
" this is only the latest in a series of measures by some jurisdictions to normalize illegal immigration			1
" the @entity213 administration originally opposed @entity1 's admission to the bar , saying that federal law demanded that legislation be enacted granting an undocumented immigrant the right to practice , according to a summary published by @entity221			1
but the @entity222 backed off in november after @entity10 's governor signed a new law that did just that			1
the bill , which passed in october and went into effect this week , allows the bar to admit " an applicant who is not lawfully present in the @entity2 ( who ) has fulfilled the requirements for admission to practice law			2
" that " greased the skids " in making the court 's work easier , said @entity234 , editor of @entity236 's @entity235 and himself an immigration attorney			0
" i think it 's a natural , logical decision , " he told @entity48 in a telephone interview , adding that he expected other states to follow suit			0
@entity246 , an immigration attorney based in @entity10 , told @entity48 in september that the court 's decision could affect hundreds of other young professionals in the @entity2 who are seeking a license			1
" he 's the first , but he 's not the only			0
there are cases going on in @entity258 and @entity259 , " said @entity252 , a third - year law student at the @entity253 in @entity254 , @entity255			2
@entity260 , who heads an immigration law and service organization that invited @entity1 to speak at her school last year , said the ruling is a positive step			2
" i 'm glad to see us moving forward in the right direction , " she said , adding that the case highlights the problems caused by backlogs in the country 's immigration system			1
" he does have an immigration application pending , " she said			0
" it 's more a result of the broken immigration system that we currently have that he 's been waiting 19 years			0

@entity151 : the decision is a legal one , not a political one
@entity10 's @entity9 : undocumented immigrant @entity1 can practice law
" i 'm glad to see us moving forward in the right direction , " one law student says
critic : case shows troubling trend , a push to " normalize illegal immigration "
