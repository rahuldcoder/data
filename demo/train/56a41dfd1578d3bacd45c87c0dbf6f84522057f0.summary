it 's a dot in the sky			0
but not just any dot			0
for the @entity4 , it 's home			0
@entity5 tweeted a photo thursday taken by @entity4 from the @entity7 surface six days earlier			1
the image shows a speck above the horizon that a pointer identifies as @entity12			1
" look back in @entity16 , " reads the accompanying text from the @entity4 's official @entity15 feed			0
" my 1st picture of @entity12 from the surface of @entity7			2
" if it 's possible for a 1 - ton , roughly suv - size vehicle to get homesick , it 's had plenty of reason to shed a tear			0
the last time @entity4 was on @entity12 was november 26 , 2011 , when it set off aboard a @entity5 spacecraft from @entity28 , @entity29			1
@entity5 launches @entity7 rover eight and a half months and some 352 million miles later , the rover landed safely on @entity7 with its 17 cameras and other assorted scientific instruments all intact			1
and almost as quickly , the @entity4 -- the centerpiece of a $ 2.6 billion project -- began transmitting images back to @entity12			2
but until now , none of those pictures actually showed @entity12 itself			0
the one released by @entity5 , which was " processed to remove effects of cosmic rays , " was taken about 80 minutes after @entity7 ' sunset with what researchers call @entity4 's " left eye camera " on its " @entity47			1
" it shows not just @entity12 but another dot that @entity5 says is our moon			1
( @entity12 was about 99 million miles away at that point , according to @entity5 's @entity53			2
@entity4 traveled a much longer distance to get to @entity7 because both planets are constantly in motion			2
) any martian or @entity58 who happened to be visiting would n't need such a special camera to see the same thing			0
according to @entity5 , " a human observer with normal vision , if standing on @entity7 , could easily see @entity12 and the moon as two distinct , bright ' evening stars			1
' " of course , photographing its native planet is n't @entity4 's main mission , which is exploring @entity7			1
since landing in @entity69 , @entity4 has helped scientists determine that an area called @entity72 was habitable in ancient times			0
here , from the rim of the crater came stream waters that formed " a lake - stream - groundwater system that might have existed for millions of years , " @entity74 , lead scientist on the @entity4 mission , wrote in last month 's edition of the journal @entity82			0
@entity5 : 2 places on @entity7 could have been habitable			2

@entity5 releases a photo taken last week from the @entity4 on @entity7
it shows a speck @entity5 says is the rover 's first image of @entity12 from the *red* planet
@entity12 , its moon would be " two distinct , bright ' evening stars ' " to observers on @entity7 , @entity5 says
@entity4 launched from @entity29 in fall 2011 , landing on @entity7 the next *august* to study that planet
