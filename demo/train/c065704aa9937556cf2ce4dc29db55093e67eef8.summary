@entity0 , @entity1 -- should @entity4 , an @entity5 fugitive living in @entity1 , ever set foot in the @entity5 again , he faces an indictment for airplane hijacking and a potentially lengthy prison term			1
so why is @entity4 now battling to return to the same country that wants to imprison him ? in 1984 , @entity4 hijacked a @entity13 passenger plane bound for @entity14 with 56 people aboard			1
a @entity16 and self - styled revolutionary , @entity4 dreamed of receiving military training in @entity1 that he could use to overthrow the @entity5 government			1
but first , the @entity21 native had to find a way to get to the island			0
@entity25 ' solution was to smuggle a .25 - caliber pistol inside a fake cast on his arm			0
the handgun set off the metal detectors at @entity32 , but all @entity4 had to do was flash his cast and an easy smile to breeze past security			2
after the plane took off , @entity4 went to bathroom , where he ditched the phony cast and put on what he calls his " @entity16 costume " of dark clothes and combat boots			2
he walked to the back of the airplane with the pistol in hand			0
a flight attendant told him to retake his seat , @entity4 said , but her eyes grew wide as she saw his changed demeanor and clothing			2
@entity4 gave her a note ordering the pilot to fly the plane to @entity1			1
over the plane 's telephone system , the pilot tried to convince @entity4 to end the hijacking			2
" i had to be forceful with him , " @entity4 remembered			2
" i tell him , if we do n't go to @entity1 , this plane is going down			2
we are going to hell or @entity1			2
" as the plane crossed the bright blue water and the coastline and palm trees came into view , @entity4 still was n't sure he was over @entity1			1
" i had them go low and circle around , " he said			0
" i was looking for @entity72 's and @entity73 and propaganda like that			0
i did n't see any of it , so i figured we must be here			0
" the plane landed in @entity0 , but @entity4 did not get the welcome he expected from his fellow revolutionaries			1
after years of hijackings to the island , the @entity1 put hijackers like him on trial			1
authorities told @entity4 that @entity88 's government was no longer involved in spreading armed revolution abroad			2
" in a machiavellian sense , the @entity1 changed , " he said			2
they used to do it , and now they do n't do it			0
" authorities offered to let @entity4 return with the plane he hijacked to the @entity5 , where air piracy charges awaited him			1
@entity4 said he would face trial in @entity1			1
" i thought i had won the case , and they gave me 15 years , " @entity4 said , recalling his brief court proceedings in @entity1			1
" i did n't even know what 15 was in @entity103			0
and they said ' quince			0
' i said , what is ' quince ? ' and my translator said 15 years			1
and i said , ' 15 years for who ? ' and they said , ' 15 years for you			1
' " even though he was sent to one of @entity1 's toughest prisons , where he regularly battled with other inmates and the guards , @entity4 never lost faith in the same revolution that had become his jailer			1
" if you are not able to suffer for the cause , you are just a play revolutionary , " @entity4 said			0
@entity4 served his time -- 13Â½ years in prison and the rest under supervised release -- and tried to fit into @entity1 society with the pidgin @entity103 he learned in prison			1
his first marriage , to a @entity1 , did n't work out			0
" that was a clash of cultures , " he explained			0
" i am @entity131 , and she 's a santera			0
" a second failed marriage produced two daughters : @entity135 , 7 , and @entity136 , 11 , named after the @entity5 fugitive also believed to be residing in @entity1 whom the @entity138 added to its list of most wanted terrorists in may			1
the girl 's mother , @entity142 , also a @entity1 , said she did n't realize her husband was naming their daughter after a fellow militant , convicted of murdering a @entity149 state trooper			0
" he likes @entity153 things , so i thought it was a @entity153 name , " she said with a roll of her eyes			0
raising his two daughters , @entity4 said , made him realize how much he missed family in the @entity5 and wanted his children to meet them			1
he said he also needed to make amends and apologize in person to the passengers of the plane he hijacked			0
@entity4 still considers himself a revolutionary but says that both he and the times have changed , and violence is no longer an acceptable way to bring about change			1
" i regret taking the plane and putting those people 's lives in jeopardy , " he said			0
" i did n't have that perspective at the time , but i have it now and will have it until the day i die			0
i would have been responsible for all those people dying			0
" in 2009 , @entity4 wrote president @entity173 , requesting a pardon for the hijacking			0
hearing nothing back , @entity4 then wrote the @entity177 in @entity14 to ask whether a plea deal could be worked out to take into account the time he had served in @entity1			1
" fifteen years in a communist prison that 's been cited for human rights violations , i have paid my debts to society , " he said			0
@entity4 again got no reply , but his daughters were given @entity5 citizenship and passports			1
@entity4 wanted to travel with them to the @entity5 and in september said he offered to surrender and face the charges awaiting him in the @entity5			1
nearly six months later , his daughters have been living with relatives in the @entity5 since december , but he is still waiting for an answer			1
but without a renewed @entity5 passport , @entity4 ca n't join his girls			1
dozens of fugitives are believed to be living in @entity1 , from convicted cop killers to @entity199 separatists to suspects in a @entity202 medicare fraud scheme			2
the @entity203 has placed @entity1 on the list of countries that support state terror , along with @entity207 and @entity208 , for providing a safe haven for fugitives from @entity5 and international justice			1
@entity4 is in all likelihood the only fugitive on the island offering to be tried			0
" no one 's harboring me , " @entity4 countered			0
" i am trying to go back			0
" the @entity177 in @entity14 said @entity4 has been indicted for the 1984 hijacking but would not comment on why his offers to surrender have gone unanswered .			2
