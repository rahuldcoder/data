-- your racial and ethnic background can shape many aspects of your life : the type of food you eat , where you live , and your political views			0
now a new survey suggests that how you sleep and what you do before you hit the hay -- whether it 's watch tv , pray , or have sex -- varies by ethnic group as well			1
in the survey , the first of its kind , a representative sample of more than 1,000 whites , @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 ages 25 to 60 were asked about their sleep and bedtime routines			1
while their answers revealed plenty of differences between groups , they also showed that we have something in common : most of us are n't sleeping well			1
in each group , roughly six out of 10 people reported that they do n't get a good night 's sleep every night or almost every night , according to the survey , which was conducted by the @entity37 , a nonprofit organization based in @entity38 " a significant proportion of all ethnic groups are experiencing sleepiness that impacts their day to day living , " says @entity42 , @entity43 , chairman of the @entity37			1
" sleepiness impacts every aspect of our lives , so for those people who are not getting a good night 's sleep , getting better sleep will make you sharper in the boardroom , give you a better quality of life , and [ make ] the sun seem a whole lot brighter			1
" across the board , a lack of sleep appears to be affecting people 's lives and relationships			1
roughly one in four people in each ethnic group said that they missed work or a family function because they were too sleepy , and a similar proportion said they were too exhausted to have sex on a regular basis			0
@entity0 : eight natural remedies that may help you sleep the survey results offered a peek inside the bedrooms of @entity15 , and how we spend our time before drifting off			0
for instance , 75 percent of @entity15 reported watching television routinely in the hour before going to bed , compared with 64 percent of whites			0
only 52 percent of @entity16 said they watched tv before bed almost every night , but they were far more likely to use a computer or surf the @entity85 before bed ; more than half said they did so almost every night , compared with about 20 percent in the other groups			1
sexual activity also varied among the groups			0
ten percent of @entity15 and @entity17 reported having sex almost every night , compared with 4 percent of whites and 1 percent of @entity16			1
@entity15 , meanwhile , were far more likely than other groups to pray before bedtime almost every night of the week			0
who -- or what -- @entity15 sleep with also appears to vary by ethnicity			1
nine out of 10 whites who are married or " partnered " sleep with their significant others , a slightly higher rate than that among @entity15			1
but three - quarters and two - thirds of @entity17 and @entity16 , respectively , said that they do n't sleep with their partner			1
those groups , however , were more likely to share a bedroom with their children			0
" @entity16 tend to sleep with children in their beds and that could have an impact on sleep quality because anything that disrupts sleep like a dog or kid in the bed can negatively impact sleep and the restorative value of that sleep , " @entity108 says			1
whites were more likely to sleep with their pets than other ethnic groups , the poll showed			0
although each group reported getting between six and seven hours of sleep on the average weekday ( or other workday ) , the amount of sleep did vary significantly			0
@entity15 got the least ( about 6.25 hours ) , and whites got the most ( just under seven hours )			0
with numbers like these , it 's not surprising that relatively few of the survey respondents reported consistently getting a good night 's sleep			1
" most people require seven to nine hours of sleep to feel rested , " says @entity108			2
" the first step is to become aware of the problem , and then make more time for sleep and engage in practices that promote good , healthy sleep			0
" according to @entity108 , good sleep hygiene includes going to bed and waking up at the same time each day ( ideally without an alarm clock ) ; using the bedroom only for sleep and sex ; abstaining from nicotine , caffeine , or alcohol after 2 p.m. ; and avoiding stressful tasks right before bed			0
@entity0 : what 's keeping you awake at night ? " if you try all these tips and are still not getting enough sleep or are still sleepy , you may have a problem that requires a greater level of intervention , such as medication or light therapy , which can help re-train or reset your body 's internal clock , " he adds			2
the rate of diagnosed sleep disorders differs among the groups , the survey found			0
whites were more likely to have been diagnosed with insomnia , while @entity15 were more likely to have sleep apnea , a breathing problem that causes people to wake up frequently			2
what else is keeping us awake at night ? roughly 20 percent of whites , @entity15 , and @entity17 said that financial problems were causing them to lose sleep at night , compared to just 9 percent of @entity16			1
more so than other groups , @entity17 also worried about health - related concerns			1
@entity184 , @entity185 , a sleep medicine specialist at @entity187 in @entity188 , @entity189 , says that the survey 's findings suggest that she and other experts in the field need to tailor their treatment to different ethnicities			2
while @entity16 reported the fewest sleep problems and were among the least likely to use sleeping aids ( such as medication ) , for instance , they were also least likely to bring up sleep problems with their doctors			1
" now that i know this , if i had an @entity205 patient , i would ask them about their sleep to get the dialogue started , " says @entity203			0
" it is really important to realize how ethnicities view sleep , so we can better target our treatment recommendations , " she adds			0
in the end , the racial and ethnic differences in the survey may be less important than the fact that so many people struggle to get a good night 's , suggests @entity221 , @entity222 , the director of the @entity223			2
" there are ethnic and cultural differences and socioeconomic factors that play a role in how much sleep everyone gets , but a significant percent of the adult population is sleep deprived , " he says			2
" the main consequence of this is impaired performance in the workplace , in the classroom , and behind the wheel , followed by irritability			0
" people with busy schedules often cut back on sleep to make time for other things , @entity221 adds			2
but , he says , " sleep is non-negotiable and is as important as diet and exercise to our overall well - being			2

three - quarters of @entity17 do n't sleep with their significant other or partner
a lack of sleep appears to be affecting people 's lives and relationships
@entity16 report fewest sleep problems and are least likely to use sleeping aids
