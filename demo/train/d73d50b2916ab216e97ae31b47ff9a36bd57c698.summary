-- november 9 , 2009 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : from @entity16 to @entity5 to @entity6 , @entity0 brings you stories from around the globe			1
kicking off a new week of commercial - free headlines , i 'm @entity22			2
first up : @entity23 @entity24 : first up , a health care reform bill passes in the @entity27 @entity26			1
saturday 's vote was a close one , though : 220 for , 215 against , with 39 @entity30 voting against the bill and one @entity33 voting for it			1
@entity30 claimed the vote as a victory , and one lawmaker said it 's their responsibility to pass health care reform			1
@entity41 @entity40 , ( @entity42 ) @entity43 : we have an obligation , constitutional and moral , to provide for the general welfare of every @entity27 citizen			2
allowing a broken health care system to continue to bankrupt families , businesses and hospitals and deny coverage to millions is a failure of duty			1
@entity24 : a lot of people agree that the country 's health care system is broken			1
but one @entity33 congressman says that the @entity26 @entity30 ' plan to fix it is the wrong approach			1
@entity41 @entity62 , ( r ) @entity63 : if your kitchen sink is leaking , you fix the sink			2
you do n't take a wrecking ball to the entire kitchen			2
this bill is a wrecking ball to the entire economy			1
@entity24 : so , what 's next ? the @entity73 has to vote on its health care bill			1
senate majority leader @entity75 says that might not happen before the end of the year as president @entity77 wanted it to			2
now , if the @entity73 passes a bill , it and the @entity26 versions would have to be combined into a new single bill , and then that would have to be passed by both houses of @entity85			1
if all that happens , then president @entity77 would have to sign the final bill for it to become law			1
a long way to go , and a lot of " if 's " along the way			1
unemployment up @entity24 : turning to the economy , the new numbers are out on the nationwide unemployment rate , and they 're not good : 10.2 percent			2
that 's up from 9.8 percent last month , and it 's the first time since 1983 that the country 's unemployment rate has been in double digits			1
the news is n't good for you guys , either i 'm sorry to say			1
teen unemployment , which covers 16 to 19 year olds , now stands at 27.6 percent			2
part of the reason for that is because teens are having to compete for jobs against adults who are out of work			2
the government is trying to help out			2
last week , president @entity77 signed a new law that extends the amount of time that people can collect unemployment benefits			2
@entity119 gov. @entity120 , @entity5 : in the days to come , our priorities are gon na be simple : support the families of those affected by this violence , support the criminal investigation that is ongoing , continue supporting our military as we always have			2
@entity128 @entity24 : that was @entity5 governor @entity120 , speaking in the wake of last week 's tragic shooting at @entity4			1
authorities still do n't know what prompted the attack there last thursday killing 13 people , wounding more than 40 others			2
the suspected gunman , who 's an @entity139 major , was shot himself several times during the attack			1
police are asking anyone who was there to step forward			1
they think people who ran away during the shooting might have evidence that could help the investigation			0
@entity4 has a processing center where soldiers go before heading off to war			0
nearby churches are offering help , services and prayers for anyone affected by the shooting			0
is this @entity157 @entity158 , @entity15 : is this legit ? former @entity27 president @entity159 : mr. @entity161 , tear down this wall ! @entity163 : is this legit ? in that famous speech , president @entity159 was talking about the @entity165			0
false ! in the 1987 address , president @entity159 was referring to the @entity168			0
@entity169 @entity24 : twenty years ago today , the @entity168 did come down , and with it , the division of @entity7 into east and west			1
on last tuesday 's show , @entity172 looked at the remains of the wall itself			1
today , @entity177 visits @entity178 , a main crossing spot when the wall was standing , and a museum dedicated to the people who tried to escape from behind it			1
( begin video ) @entity184 , @entity185 : the @entity169 at @entity178			0
it chronicles the fear and suffering , ingenuity and heroism of a generation who refused to be sealed off from the free world			1
@entity193 , @entity194 : it was very , very , very dangerous because the people , they just want to be free			0
@entity198 : a car seemingly too tiny to smuggle humans to freedom did exactly that			1
and there 's the gas tank that hid a child brought in from the cold			1
an ultralight aircraft used by a @entity209 student in a flight from communism			0
and there were tunnels , too			0
@entity214 : here you see tunnel 57 ; means 57 people could come through			0
it was about 700 tunnels the people did try to build , but very few were successful			0
@entity198 : @entity193 keeps alive the enthusiasm her late husband , @entity222 , felt when he opened the @entity169			0
he started building it as soon as the @entity224 and its allies put up the wall			0
she estimates 900,000 people come each year to share that			0
some are @entity7 students who learn from their guides about a daring balloon journey that brought entire families safely to the @entity234			1
others are visitors to @entity6 , enthralled by the sheer boldness , desperation and drive of those who risked all for freedom			1
@entity214 : our museum tells people how important to be free			1
our museum tells people how many people died that we are , today , can live in freedom			1
@entity198 : like no other place in the world , the @entity169 shows visitors the actual signposts of the @entity253			0
it even presents artifacts dug up from the street below after the fall of the wall			0
@entity214 : and this is original borderline here from @entity178			0
this is the borderline where president @entity159 in 1982 stayed and made just one step over to show he do not want any more to have this border here			1
@entity198 : for all the tactics and tricks on display , @entity6 's famous @entity169 pays homage to the pain and suffering of those captured or shot down and left to die slowly just a few steps from freedom			1
it reminds us , past or present , freedom has its price			1
( @entity276 ) horses for heroes @entity24 : for some @entity27 troops who are wounded while serving overseas , coming back home can be challenging , both physically and emotionally			1
there 's a program that aims to aid in the recovery process by offering some helping hooves			1

@entity298 , therapeutic riding instructor , @entity300 : the @entity302 program is a program for the wounded troops , no matter what branch of the service they 're in			0
so , they come out and they work with the horses			1
it 's not just about the riding			1
@entity312 : it 's a really cool feeling to , you know , be next to an animal this big that can do some serious damage if he wanted to			1
but really , they 're just big babies that love rubdowns			0
@entity321 : he 's really bonded with @entity291			1
he 's a kind of a guy 's kind of horse : loves to be groomed and he stands patiently			1

before we go @entity24 : before we go , let them eat cake ! and while you 're at it , let them wear it too ! the idea of food - based fashion may sound wicked , but that 's exactly what 's going on at this runway show : candied couture ! sounds like some weird mix of @entity418 and @entity419			2
