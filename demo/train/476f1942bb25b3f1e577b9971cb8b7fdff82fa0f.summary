" the @entity15 is to be scrapped completely just from today , " said a spokesman for the @entity9 -- the @entity10 -- according to @entity11 , the official newspaper of @entity14 's ruling @entity12			1
@entity14 cited the @entity17 's unanimous passage thursday of tougher sanctions against @entity4 for carrying out missile and nuclear tests			1
@entity14 declares 1953 armistice invalid " the collective sanction is precisely a declaration of war and an act of war against the @entity14 , " said the newspaper , using the initials of @entity14 's formal name , the @entity14			1
@entity31 - @entity30 drills @entity14 's announcement came as military drills involving @entity30 and the @entity31 were taking place			1

more than 3,000 @entity31 forces are taking part in @entity36 , according to @entity42			0
@entity14 also has called the annual training exercises " an open declaration of a war			1
" " under the cloak of the @entity17 , the @entity31 seeks to realize its aggressive purpose against the @entity14 by threatening its right to existence as well as its sovereignty , " the newspaper continued			1
" what is graver is the fact that the @entity31 cooked up the resolution on sanction timing to coincide with the ' @entity36 ' and ' @entity39 ' joint military exercises			0
" the @entity57 notified the @entity14 military on february 21 of the exercise dates , noting they are annual joint exercises defensive in nature and not related to current events on the @entity2			1

" two weeks after her inauguration , president @entity78 presided over her first cabinet meeting			0
" if we are going to get @entity14 to give up its nuclear programs and make the right choice , what is more important than anything else is to cooperate closely with the international community , " she said , according to @entity63			2
she ordered the government to take measures to keep safe @entity30 workers at a joint industrial complex in the @entity14 city of @entity94 and residents on the border island of @entity97 , which was targeted by the @entity14 artillery in 2010 , according to her spokesman , @entity63 said			2
in remarks delivered monday at the @entity102 in @entity103 , national security adviser @entity100 said , " the @entity31 will not accept @entity14 as a nuclear state ; nor will we stand by while it seeks to develop a nuclear - armed missile that can target the @entity31			2
" he added , " the international community has made clear that there will be consequences for @entity14 's flagrant violation of its international obligations			2

he cited " provocations and extreme rhetoric " from the impoverished @entity14			1
" to get the assistance it desperately needs and the respect it claims it wants , @entity14 will have to change course , " he said			2
" otherwise , the @entity31 will continue to work with allies and partners to tighten national and international sanctions to impede @entity14 's nuclear and missile programs			2
" @entity100 cited the @entity138 's imposition of @entity31 sanctions against the @entity140 of @entity14 , the country 's main foreign exchange bank , " for its role in supporting " @entity4 's weapons of mass destruction program			2
" @entity14 's claims may be hyperbolic , but as to the policy of the @entity31 , there should be no doubt : we will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against , and respond to , the threat posed to us and our allies by @entity14 , " he said			2
concern over ' bellicose rhetoric ' in @entity115 , @entity154 press secretary @entity153 told reporters that @entity4 's " bellicose rhetoric " had raised concerns			0
" the @entity14 will achieve nothing by threats or provocations , which will only further isolate @entity14 and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in northeast @entity164 , " he said			1
also monday , @entity14 did not answer its hotline with @entity117 , @entity30 's @entity165 said , according to the @entity63 news agency			0

but @entity186 , deputy public affairs officer for @entity187 in @entity14 , said reports that the @entity14 's @entity10 , known as the @entity10 , cut off communication often arise when military training exercises are taking place			1
" when we place a call on the direct phone line and the @entity10 does not answer , we have no way of knowing if the @entity10 has actually disconnected the phone lines or are just not answering the phone , " he said			0
@entity14 's nuclear warning @entity14 had previously warned it could carry out strikes against the @entity31 and @entity30			0
but analysts say @entity14 is years away from having the technology needed to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile and aim it accurately at a target			1
and , analysts say , @entity14 is unlikely to seek a direct military conflict with the @entity31 , preferring instead to try to gain traction through threats and the buildup of its military deterrent			1
its problems are also internal : a @entity213 report dated february 1 cited " grave , systematic and widespread violations of human rights " in the country			0
the @entity217 are still technically at war because the 1950 - 53 war ended in a truce , not a peace treaty			0
