-- most people who travel by train on a regular basis rush through the station so quickly , they never stop to appreciate their surroundings			2
but some railway terminals deserve a long admiring look for their beauty , their heritage and their engineering accomplishments			2
here are five that are on the right track			2
@entity14 , @entity15 for 100 years , @entity15 's @entity14 has represented big - city hustle and bustle			1
about 700,000 people pass through it every day ; yet , incredible as it seems today , @entity14 almost met its demise in the 1970s			1
it was rescued in large part by former first lady @entity22 , who became a driving force behind the campaign to protect and preserve the landmark building , saving it from the fate that befell @entity15 's original @entity28 in 1963			1
renovation and restoration has continued ever since @entity22 stepped in			2
one milestone was the cleaning and restoration of the terminal 's 25,000 - square - foot cerulean blue and gold leaf zodiac ceiling , which was enhanced further in 2010 with the addition of @entity37 to mark specific stars in the heavens			1
there 's a small @entity42 on the main concourse , and the lower level food court offers so many options , even locals eat there			1
the @entity46 -- tucked away in a corner on the upper level -- is a clubby place for cocktails			2
to mark the terminal 's 100th anniversary , a schedule of centennial events such as performances , exhibitions and art installations will continue throughout 2013			1
where can you go from here ? to suburban @entity15 and @entity61 ; as far as @entity62 or @entity63 and all points in between			0
the @entity66 project , scheduled for completion in 2019 , will provide access to the @entity69 as well			0
then again , this is @entity15 , and you do n't really need to go anywhere else to find things to see and do , starting with a guided tour of @entity14 terminal conducted by a docent from the @entity77 of @entity15 or a self - guided audio tour available in six languages			1
@entity80 , @entity81 in the past , @entity82 and @entity83 might have cast a skeptical eye toward @entity80 , @entity81 's third - largest metro area , but their skepticism turned to envy when the stunning steel and glass @entity80 , designed by @entity91 architect @entity90 , was unveiled in 2009			1
it 's a remarkable achievement , not least because during the 10 years of its construction , the trains to and from @entity80 were never shut down			1
" it was very important for us to have an architect who had ( designed ) stations before and knew how to prevent the problems , " said @entity96 , a spokesman for @entity97 , which operates @entity81 's rail stations			1
before @entity80 , @entity90 designed @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107 in @entity108 , among others ; he 's currently working on a station for @entity111 , @entity81 , that will open before the city becomes @entity114 in 2015			1
his influence is apparent throughout @entity80 , from its gently peaked 35 - meter - high glass roof to the designs of the shops and cafés on the main concourse to the children 's day care facility , the first at a @entity125 station			1
he even makes himself felt in subliminal ways			0
for instance , there is no advertising on the train platforms ; no posters or kiosks interfere with his vision or yours			0
it 's as refreshing and uncluttered as a train station can be			1
where can you go from here ? the new station was built primarily to accommodate high - speed trains such as the @entity142 from @entity106 and the @entity143 ( @entity144 ) from @entity145			1
they will take you to @entity82 in less than an hour ; @entity147 , @entity145 , in one hour and @entity148 in a little over two hours			0
@entity80 is a working city whose political and religious machinations date to when @entity152 was a lad ( he was born in the area )			1
local culinary traditions include the gin - like beverage peket , crunchy sugar - coated liègeoise - style waffles and delicious sweet - and - sour meatballs known as @entity159 a la liègeoise , all of which can be savored at the station			1
@entity164 , @entity165 just shy of its 100th birthday , the @entity164 received a facelift , bringing it as close to the way it looked when it opened in december 1914 as anyone can recall			0
the restoration was well - deserved ; the elegant red brick building has weathered plenty of upheaval in its history			1
in 1923 , the @entity176 rocked its foundation			0
in 1945 , the @entity178 destroyed the roof and much of the building 's interior , and the aftermath of @entity183 resulted in the loss of the building 's third story and two architectural domes			1
@entity188 , a prominent architect of the @entity189 at the turn of the last century , designed the station in a distinctly @entity193 style , a reflection of his time spent studying in @entity125			1
yet , like his @entity196 " @entity197 " from 1896 , the @entity164 is a @entity164 landmark			0
even in a city that embraces the ultramodern , it would be hard for most residents to conceive of anything that could take its place			0
the restoration , completed in october 2012 , brought back the domes and original architectural features and added @entity165 's largest seismic isolation system to limit the potential effects of earthquakes			1
the station 's centennial celebration starts in 2014 ; events will be announced in the coming months			2
where can you go from here ? a walk through the surrounding @entity219 business district takes you to the @entity220			0
@entity164 is the primary hub for @entity165 's famed shinkansen " bullet trains			2
" the fastest route on the @entity225 line covers the 246 miles from @entity164 to @entity227 / @entity226 in 2½ hours			0
the fastest route on the @entity230 line , traveling at up to 320 kmh , takes you from @entity164 north to @entity231 , about 350 miles , in about three hours			0
before you board , pick up an ekiben train station bento box for your trip ; these flavorful box lunches are designed for train travel and feature regional food specialties			0
@entity240 @entity239 , @entity241 in 1923 , architect @entity242 moved from @entity241 to the @entity243 and became a professor at the @entity245			1
by that time , he 'd already left @entity240 a lasting legacy : @entity240 @entity239			0
it opened in 1919 and remains one of the world 's most stunning examples of art nouveau architecture , known in @entity241 as @entity252			1
like many other landmark buildings in @entity240 ( @entity255 comes to mind ) , the station is majestic and arresting without being showy , and it represents the marriage of functionality and beauty that still defines @entity241 design			0
most majestic and arresting of all are the four granite giants who flank the station 's main entrance			2
created by @entity267 , they carry enormous globe lamps , lighting the way for the 200,000 passengers who travel to and from the station daily			0
inside the station , people stop in to the @entity274 as much to see the lovely landscape by @entity241 realist artist @entity276 on its wall as they do for the light meals served there			0
where can you go from here ? last year marked the 150th anniversary of the oldest section of track in @entity241 , the route between @entity240 and @entity287 , birthplace of @entity241 composer @entity288			0
today an express train will take you there in just over one hour			0
in just over two hours , you can be in the charming , historic city of @entity292 , with its @entity294 heritage , unusual architecture and internationally renowned shipyard where cruise ships are constructed			2
farther still , the @entity300 train runs from @entity240 to @entity301 , @entity302 ; travel times vary			0
@entity304 , @entity305 when it opened , it was called @entity304 , in honor of @entity310 's @entity309 , who had taken the title empress of @entity312 in 1877 and who 'd celebrated her @entity314 in 1887			2
( there was a ceremonial opening in the jubilee year , but the trains were n't running in earnest until 1888			0
) now celebrating its 125th anniversary , @entity305 's central station is known as @entity304 in honor of the first @entity324 emperor , and it maintains its status as one of the world 's great @entity328 buildings			2
@entity331 architect @entity330 gave the station all the ornamentation and grandeur of the @entity328 age , and then he added a little bit more : architectural features such as domes and arches derived from @entity312 styles			1
inside , it almost resembles a cathedral , from its vaulted ceiling to the stained - glass windows with images of locomotives instead of religious figures			1
in 2008 , the terminal was the target of a terrorist attack that left the city deeply shaken , but three years later , in 2011 , a flash mob of ordinary people dancing to a hit song joyfully " reclaimed " the station for the millions of travelers and commuters who pass through it each day			0
where can you go from here ? @entity304 is the busiest train station in @entity312 ; @entity362 estimates that 3 million people a day travel on the @entity366 train system			0
a regional train to @entity368 , where the real @entity369 lived in the 17th century , will take about three to four hours			0
if you 're taking your time , the @entity370 is an eight - day rail journey that starts and ends at the terminal and takes in palaces , forts , beaches and the @entity378 and @entity379 .			2

@entity91 architect @entity90 's @entity80 was unveiled in 2009
@entity14 features a 25,000 - square - foot cerulean blue and gold leaf zodiac ceiling
@entity242 's @entity386 is a stunning example of art nouveau architecture
