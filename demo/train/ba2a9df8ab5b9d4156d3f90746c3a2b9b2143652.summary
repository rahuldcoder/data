@entity0 -- as a medical student six years ago , @entity2 would travel to remote areas of @entity5 and treat patients with supplies he could carry in his backpack			1
but one time , while treating @entity12 villagers in @entity13 , @entity10 's supplies ran out			1
" i got back into the car ... having felt like i had just done so little ... and i cried for 20 minutes , " @entity2 said			1
the farming village was extremely poor , and many people were in desperate need of medical attention			1
" i essentially decided right then and there that i was going to come back , either to that village or to another one of the hundreds of thousands of villages just like it all over the world ... and i would bring more help			2
i would bring a bigger backpack			2
" today , @entity2 's " backpack " can carry 20,000 pounds of medical supplies			1
the @entity28 started floating doctors , a seafaring medical group that provides free health care for people in remote coastal regions			1
in the last two years , @entity2 and his team of volunteers have traveled on " the @entity36 , " a 76 - foot - long refurbished ship , to treat nearly 13,000 patients in @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
" most of the communities that we serve are communities that have fallen through the cracks because they 're too small , they 're too far away ( or ) they 're too hard to get to , " said @entity2 , 36			1
typically , @entity10 and his team will anchor at the coast and then use a smaller craft or vehicle to reach remote areas			1
in some cases , they 'll walk miles to reach small villages in need			2
" the end result is that you end up in a community which may never have been visited by modern health care providers , " he said			0
" i 'll find patients who have never seen a doctor before in their lives			2
" approximately one - half of the world 's population lives in rural areas , according to the @entity68 , and most of them usually lack trained health care workers			0
oftentimes , these communities do n't have electricity or running water , either			2
@entity2 first steered " the @entity36 " to @entity39 after the earthquake in 2010 , delivering 20,000 pounds of medical supplies , 80 sheets of plywood and 2,500 pounds of tin roofing			1
he and his team then stayed in the country for three months treating patients			2
they had no money for personal transportation , so they walked to and from the clinic where they worked			0
it endeared them , @entity2 said , to the @entity39 people			1
" you gain extraordinary acceptance by your patients when you walk through the same mud that they do , " he said			0
during the three months the group spent living and working in @entity39 , it operated 25 mobile clinics , treated 2,500 patients , and rebuilt schools with the tin roofing they brought			0
@entity2 said the entire undertaking cost only $ 5,000 , including the fuel to get to @entity39 from @entity106			1
it helps that the medical supplies are donated by groups like @entity110 , but using a ship is also a very cost - effective way of working			0
" you can house people onboard , " @entity2 said			1
" on a ship , you can generate your own water , you can generate your own power			0
and those power sources can be from renewable energy sources			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity123 @entity10 originally envisioned floating doctors to be a provider of " brigade medicine			1
" he imagined himself and other volunteers dropping into hard - to - reach areas for short durations			1
there , @entity10 saw the need to stay put for a while and make a real impact			0
" the benefits that you can create if you 're there longer are extraordinary , " he said			0
" in @entity39 , we learned after two weeks you just start to know your way around			0
after a month , you have some sense of the health care ecology of the area			0
after two months , you can really start calling on the community to assist you in your work			0
" in addition to providing medical care , @entity147 enlists locals to help with smaller - scale projects that address specific community needs			0
the group has installed water filtration systems , built ramps for the disabled , improved care for the elderly and raised awareness about local health issues			0
@entity10 works side by side with his younger sister , @entity165 , to run the all - volunteer organization			0
since the project began , 180 volunteers from nine countries have joined the effort , including medical residents , nursing students and retired physicians			2
@entity10 is the only full - time doctor on board			2
following their initial trip to @entity39 , @entity10 and his team traveled to @entity40 for a seven - month stay			2
they later returned to @entity39 to offer aid during a cholera outbreak , and then in may , the group left @entity39 for @entity184 , @entity41 , where they have been working for the last nine months			0
@entity2 said he knew of the need in @entity40 and @entity41 , and connections he had made in those countries enabled him to reach remote communities there			1
in the future , @entity10 hopes to set up permanent clinics that would be run by local health care workers in the three countries they 've visited			0
" i do not want to have to treat a couple hundred people and then have to go , " @entity2 said			1
" i want to treat thousands and thousands of people			1
and better than that , i want to be able to provide the people we treat with the capabilities to carry on what they 've learned so they can continue to help others after we leave			1
" floating doctors is run entirely on donations			1
while @entity2 wears many hats to keep his project afloat -- he often serves as captain , cook and lab technician -- he says he would n't have it any other way			1
" i had to postpone many aspects of my own personal life			2
i do n't have a home somewhere			0
i had to give up a lot , " he said			0
" but i gained everything			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity218 website at @entity219 and see how to help .			0
