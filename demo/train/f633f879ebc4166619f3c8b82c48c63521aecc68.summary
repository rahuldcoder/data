-- consider it the taxonomist 's equivalent of a @entity5 's @entity4			1
an international committee made up of scientists and related experts has announced its top 10 of nearly 18,000 new species named in the previous year , according to a news release from the @entity12 , part of the @entity15 's @entity14			1
the alphabetical list was launched in 2008 and is released each may 23 , the birthday of 18th - century @entity19 botanist @entity18 , who is considered the father of modern taxonomy			1
it is " a way to call attention to species that are going extinct faster than they are being identified , " the institute said in the release			1
scientists believe 10 million species await discovery , five times the number that are already known to science			1
the @entity34 of 2014 @entity35 ( @entity35 ) location : @entity37 this small mammal with fluffy red - orange fur , a short bushy tail , and an adorable , rounded face has leapt onto the raccoon family tree			1
last summer , scientists at the @entity44 in @entity45 announced the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito ( pronounced oh - lin - @entity50 - toe ) -- the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the @entity52 in 35 years , according to @entity53 , curator of mammals at the @entity44 's @entity55			1
previously , scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species , the olingos , @entity53 said in august when the discovery was announced			1
olingos are larger , less furry and have longer faces than the newly discovered species			1
researchers say the olinguito primarily eats fruits , but also insects and nectar , and its activity is mostly at night			1
the animal lives in the trees and can jump from one to another			2
at about 2Â½ feet long from nose to tail , the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is a little smaller than a house cat			2
the olinguito 's misty , high - elevation habitats in @entity80 and @entity81 , and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees , helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists previously , @entity53 said			1
@entity88 's @entity87 ( @entity90 kaweesakii ) location : @entity92 with its significant height and trunk diameter and multiple branches , it 's hard to believe that the @entity98 went undiscovered until now			2
the species , a relative of the @entity102 dragon tree , was identified on the limestone hills and mountains of @entity92			1
cream - colored flowers with bright orange filaments bloom from the tree			2
because of the low number of plants -- about 2,500 -- scientists believe the tree is endangered			2
@entity112 ( @entity113 ) location : @entity115 scientists with @entity117 ( @entity112 ) were studying ocean currents under @entity115 's ice shelf			2
setting out to test a camera - equipped robot , they discovered the @entity113 actually living in the ice			2
the sea anemones are less than an inch long and have between 20 - 24 tentacles that protrude in the chilly waters			2
while @entity115 is full of variations of sea anemone , these are the only known to actually live in the ice and it 's still uncertain how they are able to withstand the harsh conditions in which they live			2
@entity134 ( @entity136 minusculus ) location : @entity138 the @entity140 minusculus gives whole new meaning to " popcorn shrimp , " though the skeleton shrimp likely wo n't be showing up on any seafood buffets any time soon			0
the male measures just 3.3 millimeters ( about an eighth of an inch ) and the female is even smaller -- just 2.1 millimeters			0
the translucent crustacean was collected from a cave on @entity151 , off the coast of @entity138			0
@entity153 ( @entity154 ) location : @entity156 this " new fungus among us , " is bright orange when produced in colonies			0
the fungus was identified in a journal published by the @entity162 , and was named as a tribute to the @entity165 royal family , specifically @entity166 the @entity167			1
this new species " was isolated from soil in @entity156 , " the release said			1
leaf - tailed @entity171 ( @entity172 ) location : @entity174 you might have to look hard for this gecko			0
not only was it discovered in an isolated rainforest in the @entity179 of eastern @entity174 , but its long , slender body , short head and spotted coloring help the creature stay hidden in the rocky terrains where it lives			0
despite its characteristically " leaflike " wide tail , which also serves as camouflage , the gecko only measures around 4 inches long			0
the @entity172 tends to sit and wait for its prey and usually comes out at night			0
@entity192 ( @entity193 ) location : @entity195 at 4 to 5 centimeters in length ( 1Â½ to 2 inches ) , the @entity193 is one of the largest unicellular organisms in the @entity195			0
the body of the creature is stalklike , expanding to a bulb with spicules , like microscopic tentacles , that absorb food like a sponge			0
the @entity206 lives off the southeast coast of @entity208 in underwater caves			0
@entity210 ( @entity211 ) locations : @entity213 and @entity214 in an effort to prevent unauthorized earthly organisms from making their way into space , @entity215 makes every effort to disinfect rooms where spacecraft are assembled			0
yet , it was in two of these " clean rooms " -- 2,500 miles away from each other -- at @entity228 in @entity213 and @entity229 in @entity214 -- where the microbial species @entity211 was discovered			1
the berry - shaped bacteria can withstand stresses such as drying , chemical cleaning , ultraviolet treatments and lack of nutrients , and also show elevated resistance to spacecraft sterilization methods such as heating and peroxide treatment			0
itsy bitsy dinosaur was @entity244 cousin @entity245 ( @entity247 nana ) location : @entity249 do n't let the name fool you -- while @entity247 nana evokes images of @entity255 's angelic fairy friend , this species , found in rainforests of @entity249 , is the newest member of the wasp family			1
@entity247 nana measures 250 micrometers ( 0.00984 inches ) long , just 2.5 times the width of a human hair			0
dr. @entity262 , one of the scientists who made the discovery , called finding the insect " the equivalent to finding a solitary needle in 200 haystacks			0
" 9 places on @entity270 we know very little about @entity273 ( @entity274 ) location : @entity276 the land snail was found nearly 3,000 feet below the surface of the @entity280 caves			0
its nearly translucent shell gives the animal a ghostly appearance , the release said , and the species does n't have eyes			1
at just 2 millimeters in length , this " slower than a snail " snail may cruise the water currents or take a ride atop a bat or a cricket to get where it 's going , scientists believe			0
rare goblin shark caught @entity0 's @entity299 contributed to this report .			0
