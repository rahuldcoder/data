@entity0 -- a year after police discovered four bodies dumped along a remote stretch of @entity0 beach , authorities said tuesday they believe they 've found the body of a missing @entity9 woman whose disappearance triggered the search			1
" if it is @entity15 , then her location is indicative of her trying to make it to the causeway , " situated northeast of where the remains were ultimately found , said @entity20 police commissioner @entity19			1
the suspected skeletal remains of @entity22 , 24 , were uncovered in a remote marshland on @entity25 's @entity24			1
her disappearance in may 2010 prompted a search that has since unearthed 10 sets of human remains strewn across two @entity25 counties , leading to national headlines and a hunt for a possible serial killer			1
a medical examiner is expected to determine whether the remains belong to the @entity38 , @entity9 , resident , whose death authorities have previously said is not likely attributed to the suspected killer			1
police cut through a thicket of brush and bramble this week , expanding their search across swampland before uncovering @entity22 's suspected remains			2
" the terrain would have made it impossible for her to get to " @entity52 , @entity19 told reporters			0
homicide detectives spotted the bones at 9:14 a.m. tuesday while riding atop " an amphibious machine " after having drained nearby areas last week in an effort to improve access and visibility			2
the remains were discovered about a quarter mile away from @entity22 's pocketbook , which was found last week alongside a cell phone , shoes and a pair of jeans			1
" it is certainly a sad day for the @entity22 family , " @entity19 added			0
after @entity22 vanished last year , the search for her led police seven months later to four bodies found along a quarter - mile stretch of @entity24			1
additional remains were uncovered in subsequent months at neighboring @entity75 and along beachfront property in @entity77 , about 40 miles east of @entity0			2
like the four victims found last december , @entity22 had advertised prostitution services on websites such as @entity81			0
@entity22 's sisters have said the missing woman was an escort who was visiting a client			0
they said she ran from the man 's house in a panic , saying someone was trying to hurt her			0
a man who lives a few miles from where the first set of remains were found told @entity1 that a young woman who " looked like she was partying all night " came to his door around 5 a.m. on may 1 , 2010			2
" she was screaming , ' help me , help me ! ' and said somebody was chasing her , " said resident @entity100 , who called police			0
the woman then ran off , he said , just before a man drove up in a dark - colored sport utility vehicle and inquired of her whereabouts			0
" this may be just a young lady ( who ) ran into the brush in hysterical state , fell down and expired for some reason , " @entity19 said wednesday			0
the police commissioner last week announced that the investigation into the other bodies now is concentrated on the possibility of a single serial killer -- a departure from his earlier statements in which he said the bodies could be the work of one or more killers			1
it is unclear what prompted the change in focus toward one killer .			0

the remains are found a quarter mile from belongings found last week , police say
a medical examiner will determine if the remains are @entity15 's
the search led to the discovery of other bodies , triggered a hunt for a possible serial killer
remains of others were found on @entity24 and @entity146 beaches and another location on @entity25
