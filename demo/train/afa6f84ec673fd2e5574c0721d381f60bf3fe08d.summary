@entity0 -- a pamphlet designed to help heroin users with advice has come under fire , with some now questioning whether the public health brochure can actually be used as a how - to guide on drug use			1
while concerns over the 16 - page pamphlet have arisen in recent days , the @entity0 @entity8 created its " @entity12 , @entity11 " brochure in 2007			1
its purpose , according to a statement from the department , is " to help people who are injecting drugs reduce the harm associated with this type of drug use until they are able to get into treatment and recover			2
" according to the @entity27 , " accidental overdose is the fourth leading cause of early adult death in @entity0 , claiming more than 600 lives each year			0
" the agency says about 70,000 pamphlets have been produced at a cost to city taxpayers of slightly more than $ 32,000			2
" the pamphlet provides potentially life saving advice " reads a health department statement			2
but critics such as @entity0 councilman @entity37 , chairman of the council 's @entity38 , believes the pamphlet is " an indefensible waste of taxpayer money " and is effectively spreading a lie that there is a safe way to inject drugs			1
" heroin use is at epidemic levels in @entity0 , and we should be spending money to address that , not teach first - timers how to use , " says @entity37			1
information in the publication takes the form of " ten critical tips for reducing the harm that illicit drug use , and especially injection drug use can cause			2
" tip topics include " how to prevent overdose , " " prepare drugs carefully , " " take care of your veins " and " ask for help to stop using			0
" within each of the 10 broad tips , the brochure presents several " simple but valuable " related ideas for users about how to lessen potential problems when injecting drugs			2
one suggestion reads , " use with someone else			0
if you 're alone and something goes wrong , no one can help			0
" another says , " use a new syringe , cooker , cotton , tie , and other supplies every time			0
" plus , " warm your body ( jump up and down ) to show your veins			0
" along with , " find the vein before you try to inject			0
" there is also information regarding @entity89 and hepatitis - c testing , depression and contact information for emergencies and for finding help to quit			2
@entity0 mayor @entity95 addressed the pamphlet controversy on monday , explaining how " the health department does have an interest in -- if you 're going to do certain things -- to get you to do it as healthily as you possibly can			1
" @entity101 , research director for the @entity102 , said the principle behind the pamphlet has always been to emphasize treatment and to reduce the spread of disease like hiv / aids			2
however , if people still engage in risky behavior , the " @entity12 , @entity110 " information is meant to mitigate risks associated with intravenous drug use and present guidance for people to partake in the safest manner possible			0
but @entity37 believes the pamphlet goes " well beyond clean needles " advice , providing anyone who wants to experiment with information about how to prepare drugs and find veins -- information that an already - using addict would find useless			1
@entity129 's top @entity128 official , @entity127 , echoes @entity37 , saying the pamphlet is essentially a " how - to guide " for drug use			1
@entity127 expressed his concern that the pamphlet could send a message that leads individuals to believe they can use heroin in some safe manner			1
" using heroin can never be safe			0
it 's akin to playing @entity141 roulette with a loaded gun " @entity127 told @entity1			0
indeed , " there is no safe way to inject " agreed @entity101 , in response to criticism that the pamphlet presents heroin use as harmless			1
" i think the word ' safely ' is wrong , " he said , but if people do inject drugs , he hopes large information campaigns can help lessen risks			0
" using hard drugs is just not a smart thing to do , " @entity95 said monday			1
" but we have an obligation no matter what the people do in this city to make sure they do it as safe as they can			1
" @entity37 , meanwhile rhetorically asks , " what 's next , a kids ' guide for playing safely in traffic ? " @entity37 said he sent a letter to the city 's health commissioner monday to immediately cease circulation and funding for the pamphlet , and he plans to " hold his feet to the fire during upcoming budget meetings " unless the health department admits its mistake			1
the pamphlet is just one component of a larger municipal effort , explained @entity101			0
along with the informational brochure , there are also face - to - face community outreach initiatives , expansion of drug abuse treatment facilities and 47 state - authorized syringe exchange program throughout @entity0 's five boroughs			1
@entity101 points to an 80 percent reduction of @entity89 reported among new drug users in @entity0 as proof that programs such as needle exchanges are working			0
the health department reports that overdose deaths have declined by 25 percent from 2006 to 2008 , representing at least 200 fewer deaths			0
" i do n't think there is a healthy way [ to use heroin [ , but there may be less dangerous ways to do certain things , " @entity95 said			1
@entity1 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
