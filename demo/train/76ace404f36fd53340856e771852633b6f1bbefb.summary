it 's a side of @entity2 the rest of the world does n't normally get to see -- the kaleidoscopically brilliant interiors of the country 's intricately designed mosques			1
with beautiful mosaics and stained glass framed by powerful architecture , the buildings are astounding			2
their fine detail has been captured in a series of breathtaking photographs by @entity16 , a 24 - year - old physics student from @entity17 , a city in @entity2 's northern @entity19			1
what 's equally incredible is that @entity16 's skills behind the lens are largely self - taught from watching internet tutorials			1
add to that the difficulties of actually taking high quality photos in mosques , where using equipment such as tripods is heavily restricted			2
@entity16 says his project to document mosque interiors and other @entity2 landmarks began in 2008 after he was inspired by images taken inside @entity34 's pyramids			1
prohibited equipment " the photos had aesthetically documented those historical sites and made me highly amazed and inspired , " he tells @entity1			0
" i wondered if i could take similar pictures of historical sites , and so through my trips all around @entity2 , i began to find old mosques suitable for taking interior pictures			1
" it was n't an easy task			0
while tourists are permitted to take photos , using tripods and the professional equipment @entity16 needed to capture his perfectly symmetrical shots in low light is usually forbidden			2
" most of the time i had to take care of lots of paperwork , spending several days to get official permission , " he says			0
" this process is even harder than it sounds , and i 've had several unsuccessful efforts			0
" @entity16 uses fisheye and other wide angle lenses and panoramic tripods to create his photos , sometimes digitally stitching several images to create composites			1
often , his work involves an early start			0
lack of appreciation " i prefer mornings , as the light is more appropriate and there are fewer people around , " he says			0
" in the afternoon , these places are usually crowded , and in the evenings , some of them are closed for praying rituals			0
" @entity16 says he prefers capturing the interiors of mosques with symmetry , interior columns , good lighting and beautiful mosaics			1
" i also like buildings that are well known , popular and important			0
although there are many people and tourists taking pictures of those places , and there are numerous images on the internet , i enjoy showing them in my own way			2
" while his work has begun to attract international attention , @entity16 says it 's yet to stir significant interest in @entity2			1
" i 've even sent it to national festivals			0
not only was my work not been seen or selected , but i did n't even receive any appreciation or support from organizations or government			0
" in spite of that , i 'm sincerely happy that my work is now being seen worldwide and that i 've been able to show @entity2 to others through my art. " @entity16 says he 's hoping to augment his image series by visiting more historic sites in @entity2 and also hopes to travel to photograph @entity107 and @entity108 holy sites .			1

@entity16 's *staggeringly* beautiful images show a side of @entity2 seldom seen outside the country
the *23* - year - old 's *camera* skills are largely self - taught from internet *tuition* videos
