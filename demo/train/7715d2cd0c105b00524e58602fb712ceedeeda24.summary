-- for most people , keeping fit involves an established exercise routine built around a regular weekly schedule			1
but what if your job involves large amounts of travel ? many people come back from trips away carrying extra pounds from disruption to regular exercise , as well as an increased tendency to overindulge on business dinners paid for on the company card			1
according to the @entity18 , lack of exercise not only impairs your waistline , but can also reduce energy and concentration levels -- the exact qualities that are required when conducting business abroad			1
@entity24 is a personal trainer and managing director of @entity26			1
the @entity28 former @entity27 says that with the right foresight , it 's possible to incorporate a healthy regime wherever and however you travel			2
1 ) do n't treat business travel as a " holiday " from your health regime there 's a temptation to regard exercise as a means to looking good on holiday , rather than as an ongoing strategy for health and well - being			1
" a lot of people diet or work out to go on holiday			2
and for me that 's a problem , because you have short - term goals , " says @entity24			1
" you switch off when you reach the goal , and your body goes ' great , i 'm done ' - and in two weeks you 're back the way you were before			2
" according to @entity24 , this exemplifies the most common obstacle to keeping fit while traveling : attitude			1
people tend to perceive trips away from home as in some way separate from the rest of their lives and that therefore the same rules no longer apply			1
2 ) prepare and do research before you travel , investigate the best locations for your preferred form of exercise			2
if you 're into cycling , see if there 's a local bike hire company nearby ; if you 're a jogger , plan the most scenic route to get the most of your new environment			0
@entity24 's motto is " plan , plan , plan			1
" she says that a common trap during hectic business trips is failing to schedule and prioritise your adapted exercise regime before you leave			1
" it should be exactly the same process as planning a meeting			0
you put it in your diary			0
if you had a meeting at work you would have to be there , it 's the same thing " instructs @entity24			1
" it 's a mental battle more than anything else			0
" 3 ) bring portable fitness equipment sometimes there simply wo n't be an opportunity to access a gym			1
if so , there is an extensive range of portable exercise equipment , from simple skip ropes to more sophisticated gadgets -- such as the magnetic tension mini-bike			1
for @entity24 's money , the tiny @entity102 suspension system is hard to beat			1
" it 's basically using gravity against your ankle , it 's a nice idea			0
you can even put it in your handbag			0
i use it a lot			0
" 4 ) do n't overindulge at business dinners there 's no getting away from it -- maintaining a healthy diet during a business trip is a challenge			1
there 's little or no opportunity to prepare your own meals and the most delicious eat - out options will rarely flatter your physique the following day			0
this , combined with a generous expenses card , is a recipe for disaster			0
@entity24 , though , has a few simple tricks : " instead of using calories , you look at your plate , and put your fist next to your carbohydrate section and it should be the same size , " she says			2
" the size and thickness of your palm is the amount of protein you can eat			0
so it would be the size of a chicken fillet or turkey			0
" additionally , you can prevent yourself gorging out at the end of a long day by making sure you eat small amounts at regular intervals			2
' it 's all about not getting hungry			0
people starve themselves thinking it 's going help , but it really does n't , especially if you 're travelling , " explains @entity24			1
5 ) take advantage of hotel fitness services @entity156 is general manager of @entity158 's prestigious @entity157			2
they have introduced a " sports buddy " program , whereby staff with particular sporting skills are teamed - up with guests keen to keep fit during their stay			2
" it came along about seven years ago , " he says			0
" we had two guests that were very keen sports people			0
but they were single travellers -- and things like playing tennis and squash , you need another person to play with			0
" his hotel reflects a growing trend within the hospitality industry to provide high quality , bespoke fitness options			0
" we think a bit more about the health and fitness of our guests than we did 30 years ago , " he notes			0
" we got a great gym and we got great relationships with local places ... and i have about a dozen people on my team who play sports from golf , through horse riding , squash , tennis to cycling			0
" so , if @entity156 has his way , trips abroad will no longer be occasions where you escape from exercise , but where you go especially to keep fit .			1

many people come back from trips abroad carrying a few extra pounds
disruption of regular exercise regime and extra business dinners partly to blame
