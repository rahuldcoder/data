@entity0 -- in a rare public appearance , president @entity2 delivered a serious message for the 99 % : step up			1
the 43rd president , who has taken to oil painting , emerged from his self - imposed , post-presidential low - profile to call on the majority of @entity9 who have not had to sacrifice for -- and could easily ignore -- two costly wars in @entity12 and @entity13 that he launched			1
" they are the 1 % of @entity9 who kept the 99 % safe , " @entity2 said wednesday of the 2.5 million military members who have served since 9/11			1
" while it never hurts to say thank you , that is not really the point			0
" speaking at the @entity23 in @entity24 and joined by second lady @entity25 , the former president did not sugarcoat the disconnect between service members , their families and the civilian public , which he called the " civilian - military divide			1
" it 's " troubling " that 84 % of veterans say the public is n't aware of the challenges they face and that 71 % of @entity9 agree , @entity2 said , citing a survey by the @entity23 and @entity38 to be released later this year			1
the toll for members of the military has been high			1
more than 50,000 @entity9 and coalition forces have been wounded in @entity13 and @entity12 , and 8,211 have died			0
see @entity1 interactive unemployment plagues veterans			1
at the end of last year , the unemployment rate for post- 9/11 veterans hovered at 10 % , compared to just above 7 % for non-vets			2
the suicide rate among vets is astronomical , with 22 suicides committed each day , according to the @entity52			0
and more than 400,000 veterans are waiting for their disability benefits in a backlogged @entity52 system , says the group @entity12 and @entity57			2
" it 's an unprecedented demand that we 've placed on such a small group , " said @entity58 , head of @entity12 and @entity57 ( @entity59 )			0
" after everything they do for us , we have a duty to make that transition as easy as possible , " he said , noting that higher education institutions and employers are among those not doing enough			0
he even said his own previous efforts , including sporting events designed to help vets , are important but are n't " transformative enough			0
" @entity2 announced that his @entity74 initiative has launched a multi-faceted , public - private partnership aimed at helping veterans assimilate back into civilian life			1
" we 'll be ... relentless in serving our vets , " he said			2
the @entity23 is working with a coalition of government , nonprofit , universities and private companies to de-stigmatize @entity84 , help @entity86 recipients stay in school , and encourage employers to give veterans a chance			2
the straight - talking former president said employers need to tailor their recruiting and hiring practices to accommodate post-war employees			1
" i mean , you do n't see many job postings that say " wanted : experience hunting insurgents and terrorists willing to risk their lives for co-workers , " @entity2 said			1
" i mean , what 's a veteran supposed to put down ? ' my last office was a @entity106 ? ' " @entity2 also said @entity84 needs to drop the @entity107 ' from its acronym , @entity84			1
he referred to it as @entity110 , calling it an injury that can be treated			2
" employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress , " he said			2
veterans groups praised @entity2 's effort			1
" i honestly think this is a great program , " said @entity124 , director of the veterans affairs and rehabilitation division at the @entity127 , who attended the event in @entity24			0
but veterans advocates say the talk has to be backed up by action			0
the elephant in the room , @entity59 's @entity58 said , is the question of how to pay for it			0
and the monetary cost is great			0
a report released last march calculated that the cost of the wars , including health care for veterans , would be up to $ 6 trillion dollars			0
the @entity9 has spent around $ 2 trillion directly on the military operations there .			0

president @entity2 *unveiled* an *aggressive* initiative to serve veterans
he said he will be relentless in *bridging* the " civilian - military " *gap*
he said ptsd needs to be *reclassified* as an injury , not a *disorder*
