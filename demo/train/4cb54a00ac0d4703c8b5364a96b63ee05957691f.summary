imagine an @entity2 billionaire who is so callous that he could fly into @entity3 , @entity4 , for the annual @entity5 and announce that " @entity2 's lifestyle expectations are far too high and need to be adjusted so we have less things and a smaller , better existence			1
" pretty outrageous , do n't you think ? it gets worse			1
the guy took a pounding , as some of the snarkier commentary noted that he had arrived in @entity4 via private aircraft with two nannies in tow			1
i would have joined the criticism -- how insensitive could that fellow be ? except the quote was credited to me and i know that i never said it			1
most public people have experienced interview mishaps , and typically it 's a matter of a mistake , or misinterpretation			1
the most generous thing i can say about the article that was published after that interview was that perhaps the reporter did n't hear half of what i said			2
i do talk fast , and the conditions were not ideal			2
but what bothered me most in all this was how this whole incident fed a narrative that the wealthy are detached , that they just do n't care			2
and , just as bad , they attend meetings like @entity3 simply to give the impression that they do			2
in fact , the people i spoke with while i was there were without exception concerned about the struggles of individuals and families affected by globalization , disruptive technologies , and most of all the long - term challenge of economic inequality			1
i can say these things from experience -- i have often talked about this issue , calling for policies to bolster the middle class and even expressing support for increasing taxes on the wealthy			2
as a guy who grew up in middle class @entity64 , @entity66 , i know how hard people work just to make ends meet and how years of stalled income growth can drain people of their hope and optimism			1
i saw it myself growing up when my father lost his business			2
as a result of what i have seen and experienced growing up and as a businessman i have continued to the problem of inequality many times and voiced support for education , investment in infrastructure , and economic policies to aid those who are middle class and those who aspire to be			2
the trouble is that too often , our elected leaders are n't listening -- and they are making decisions today that are undermining this country 's future			0
the reality is that in a global marketplace , people from @entity98 to @entity99 are often competing for some of the same work with comparable skills			1
meanwhile , new technologies are allowing companies to make the same goods , or provide the same services , with fewer people			1
the result is that our workers are being squeezed on both the supply and demand side , as the labor supply in many industries falls , prompting a decline in wages and overall employment			0
here in the @entity2 , we have traditionally counted on superior skills and a strong service economy to counter the effects of international competition			1
however , in recent years , workers in other countries have become better educated and more qualified , allowing them to compete more aggressively			0
transportation offers a telling example as app - based services including @entity127 and @entity128 instantly connect drivers in their own cars with customers who need a ride			0
consumers get cheaper transport , and car owners get to earn some money with a vehicle that would otherwise be idle			0
but @entity127 will inevitably undermine established car services , and firms that directly pay wages and benefits to workers such as drivers , mechanics , managers and dispatchers			0
yes , you may get a cheaper ride across town today , but the cabbie who is put out of work had his or her life turned upside down			1
other big industries will be disrupted by 3 - d printing , a near miraculous technology capable of creating a perfect prosthesis for someone who lost a leg , or printing an entire building in @entity160			0
in the not - so - distant future , we may all have these machines in our homes or neighborhoods			0
the most important manufacturing companies may be those that make the machines and those that make the materials that go into the printers , something that again will most likely require few workers			0
these developments pose a profound challenge to the @entity2 , and we 'll need a comprehensive strategy that draws on the best ideas available to ensure everyone has a chance to succeed			1
president @entity182 's recent proposal for free community college for all is a good first step			0
but what the @entity2 economy really needs is an over-arching policy to promote lifelong learning , so that workers can continually adapt to new market opportunities			1
in addition , we also need a stronger safety net for the workers who are displaced , which would give more people time to adjust to a continually changing job market			1
unfortunately , the policies we need will not emerge from a media - driven debate that starts with the premise that uncaring rich guys are n't concerned about others			0
closing the gap is going to take innovative thinking and a willingness to believe that we are all in this together			0
we are going to have to trust each other , drop our assumptions , and make a commitment to open and accurate debate			0
i 'm willing to do so , even at the risk of being cast , unfairly , as the poster boy for the insensitive upper class .			0
