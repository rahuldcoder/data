-- half a century ago , with the space race in full swing , the heated quest for interplanetary exploration between the @entity4 's superpowers gained a new , self - proclaimed , contender			2
" we 're going to @entity19 ! " audaciously declared @entity9 schoolteacher @entity8 in a 1964 newspaper op - ed , revealing to the world his fanciful plans for his country to beat the @entity14 and the @entity15 in their fierce battle to conquer outer space			1
" our rocket crew is ready , " continued @entity8 , explaining that his aspiring troupe of space explorers had been gearing up for their interstellar journey in the headquarters of the academy he 'd set up on the outskirts of @entity9 capital @entity28			1
from within what he called the " @entity31 and @entity32 , " @entity8 said , he 'd been studying @entity19 through telescopes			2
he 'd also been training his would - be astronauts by rolling them down a hill in oil drums , a technique aimed at getting his team acclimatized to the weightlessness experienced during space travel			2
read this : @entity44 doctor takes to the skies " specially trained spacegirl @entity48 , two cats ( also specially trained ) and a missionary will be launched in our first rocket , " wrote @entity8 , a grade - school science teacher and self - appointed director of the space academy			1
unsurprisingly , the program , which was never taken seriously by the government of the newly independent @entity9 , failed to take off ; a $ 7 million grant @entity8 said he 'd requested from @entity56 never came , whilst the pregnancy of the 17 - year - old spacegirl brought the proceedings to an end			1
" the @entity61 " fast forward to 2010 , when @entity64 photographer @entity63 was searching for " unbelievable stories " for a new personal project she was hoping to develop			1
whilst scouring the depths of the internet , she stumbled on a website listing the 10 craziest experiments in history			2
" the first one on the list was the @entity9 space program , " says @entity72 who , after a decade of working as a news photojournalist , had decided to embark on a new career as a visual storyteller			1
fascinated by @entity8 's visionary and dreamy perspective on life , @entity72 set about creating an imaginary documentation of his elusive endeavors some 50 years ago			1
the result is " @entity85 , " an arresting photo book that has been shortlisted for this year 's esteemed @entity87			1
in the self - published book , @entity72 self - consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece			1
she uses a series of cinematographic images , including staged depictions of discarded oil barrels , makeshift spaceships , elephant - hugging spacemen and flying cats , as well as vintage - looking maps , documents and newspapers cuttings			0
throughout , facts and fiction are intertwined as part of an intriguing narrative which challenges viewers ' perceptions about what 's real and what 's not			0
" i was working in a very free way , " says @entity72 , sitting at the café of the @entity112 in @entity113 , where the @entity61 is being exhibited			1
" i needed to add mystery ; i needed to add this fascination for great things and work on the photographic language that would not state if it 's true , " adds @entity72 , encouraging viewers to question the documentary value of photography			2
" otherwise , i would have ruined the game			0
" " @entity123 dreams " whilst playful , @entity72 's dream - like images are not intended to make fun of @entity8 's fantastical , yet high - flying , ambitions			0
her speculative pictures exude a feeling of nostalgia and sympathy , celebrating the audacious and naive spirit of a past era where grandiose dreams were not limited by circumstances			0
" i think that 's the greatest characteristic we have as humans , that we can dream of becoming big , " says @entity72			0
read this : artist 's spectacular glasses " that is something common to all humanity , " she adds			0
" you do n't have to be @entity14 and work for @entity147 to dream of going to the moon ; you can be an @entity149 -- he [ @entity8 ] was a school teacher and thought that could be done			1
" " honest approach " creating the @entity61 , which was sold out in just a few months , @entity72 worked more as a movie director , trying to make the best of the resources around her			1
for models , she relied on social media and friends ; for the astronauts ' helmets , she used old domes of street lights ; and for the flashy spacesuits , she employed the sewing talents of her grandmother			0
" it was like a short , small and very modest movie production , " says @entity72			0
" but instead of producing a moving image , i just did stills			0
" most of the images were shot in between different projects , in locations such as @entity64 , the @entity179 territories , @entity180 and @entity181			0
others were repurposed pictures from the photographer 's archive			0
@entity72 , who 's never been to @entity9 , acknowledges she 's not " an expert in @entity188 " -- nor in space			1
this led her to go about the story with caution			0
" i always kept in my mind that i do n't know a lot about @entity149 history and i am approaching a subject that can be sensitive or can be offensive for some people , " says @entity72			1
so far , she says , her work has received a great response from people in @entity188			2
she 's been contacted by @entity44 's space program and been invited to the continent to give talks , while her book is being shown in @entity188 and @entity207			1
" i would love to [ take the exhibition to @entity28 as well ] , " she says			0
if anything , @entity72 says , the extraordinary tale of the forgotten @entity9 space program presented a chance to talk about @entity188 from a different perspective			1
" the only honest approach i could do to that story was documenting my cliché , and that 's what i really wanted to do , because , in a way , i was raising awareness of the existence of that cliché and what we expect from @entity188 , " she says			2
read this : @entity9 's amazing street acrobats " not only because the story is positive , in terms of @entity149 people having dreams , but also evidencing what we expect from @entity188 in terms of aesthetics and behavior			1
" today , nobody seems to know what happened to @entity8 or his cast of wannabe space explorers			2
yet @entity8 's desire to dream the impossible has found a new , alternative , home inside @entity72 's images , striking a chord with captivated audiences around the world			0
" he had a fascination for the universe that we all share , " says @entity72			0
" asking if we 're alone , looking at the stars , making metaphysical questions			0
that is a universal feeling and it does n't belong to the people who can actually have the technology to go to the moon ; it 's everywhere			0

in the mid- 1960s , a @entity9 school teacher wanted to send the first @entity149 to space
' the @entity61 ' photo book is a fictional documentation of his endeavors
the work , by @entity63 , has been shortlisted for the @entity87 prize
