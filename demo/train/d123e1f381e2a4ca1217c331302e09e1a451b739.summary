-- gourmet cuisine has long been a staple of business class and first - class menus			1
but a number of airlines are taking the in - flight meal to new heights by bringing chefs on board to serve up a fine dining experience in the sky -- scooping up culinary awards in the process			1
@entity15 has gone as far as to poach expert cooks from a number renowned @entity19 - starred restaurants since launching its " flying chef " service on long haul flights late last year			1
the concept has thus far proved a recipe for success , with the @entity27 based airline winning the award for best first - class catering at the 2012 @entity30 earlier this month			1
but given the cramped kitchen conditions of the airplane galley and the complexities of cooking at altitude , is it really possible to rustle up meals worthy of the masterchefs whilst cruising at 35,000 feet ? according to @entity38 , head of guest experience and catering at @entity15 , unequivocally , yes			1

" our first - class guests receive unparalleled attention and choice -- for example , the opportunity of having their personal chef tailor - make dishes based on their individual tastes and preferences , " he adds			1
@entity38 highlights the " balik style smoked salmon " and " pan-seared scallops with a parmesan cheese sauce " as particular examples of the gastronomic complexity of the @entity15 first - class menu			1
" the chef can talk ( to ) and recommend food directly to our guests and make suggestions of what they might like on the menu , " says @entity38			0
" he is able to personally adjust seasonings and recommend menu and beverage choices to each guest			0
they can also make changes to existing menu items ... changing sauces or taking out particular ingredients			0
" some industry experts , however , are less effusive about the possibilities of in - flight chef operations according to @entity84 , group director of culinary excellence at @entity86 , an independent provider of airline catering services , there are a number of factors that restrict the cuisine chefs can produce whilst airborne			2
" because of the ( safety ) limitations on the aircraft there are no items like a frying pan where a chef is cooking and tossing things up in a different way , " says @entity84			2
knives and other sharp implements are also not permitted aboard airplanes , tying chefs ' hands yet further			2
as a result , most food is still prepared on the ground before being reheated en - masse in a steam pressure oven whilst in the air , @entity84 explains			0
the chef can then alter the ingredients slightly or add extra dressings to meet the individual tastes of passengers			2
on the whole , however , meals are prepared in much the same way as they always have been , he adds			2

" the cabin pressure of being at 35,000 feet in the air means you lose about 10 % of your taste buds , " he says			0
" therefore the food always has to be stronger or there will have to be a little bit more seasoning , which obviously alters the taste			0
" but @entity135 of @entity136 -- one of the first organizations to introduce a chef service aboard its flights -- is adamant that on - board chefs can bring benefits			1
he says that they can help deliver a superior level of customer service , strengthening the carrier 's brand image and differentiating them from competitors flying similar routes			0
" we do our best to make a flight with @entity136 a high - level experience , which is why we have one chef on board of every single long - haul flight , " says @entity135			1
" the menus are ... refined @entity156 minute by a chef who will pamper the palates of our guests on board			0
( this ) service is highly valued by our customers , " he adds			0
in spite of the many complexities of aerial cooking , @entity84 agrees with @entity135 that on - board chefs can still add value to the in - flight customer experience			1
" it 's much more interactive if the chef can come out and say hello to the passengers rather than the crew just handing out menus and then food , " he says			0
" i think it makes a big difference if a chef with passion is on board to explain the food to customers , for the visual appeal it will also look much nicer			0
" this can really help the airline company go the extra mile in presentation and service , " he concludes .			0
