-- the world is ok -- at least this time -- and scientists are psyched			0
an asteroid dubbed 1998 @entity5 whizzed past @entity6 on friday , with its own moon in tow			1
" # @entity11 has sailed harmlessly past @entity6 , " @entity10 's @entity9 tweeted around 5 p.m. et. it got within about 3.6 million miles of our planet			1
that 's close relatively given the vastness of space , but still more than 15 times the distance from wherever you are to our moon			2
the fly - by had astronomers less fearful and more excited about getting the " best look at this asteroid ever , " according to @entity10			1
the resulting images should be of similar quality to those obtained when spacecraft get up close to asteroids , said @entity31 of @entity10 's @entity9			1
scientists have been rubbing their hands for a decade and a half for this opportunity since they discovered the asteroid on august 19 , 1998 , the year for which it is named			2
the letter " q " stands for the month of august			0
" as my old friend , radar astronomer @entity43 used to say , spaceship earth is making a fly - by of the asteroid , so we 're going to exploit the capabilities of the radars to understand as much as possible , " @entity31 said , according to a story on @entity10 's website			1
forget falling stars : @entity10 plans to catch an asteroid a milestone asteroid 1998 @entity5 represents a milestone in @entity10 's @entity54 , which scopes out the heavens for potential danger from celestial projectiles whizzing past			1
" it 's one of the initial successes of our effort to find the big asteroids that could hit the @entity6 and cause global catastrophe , " said @entity59 , a scientist with the project			1
" it 's certainly one to keep an eye on			2
" @entity10 has been tracking it with radar devices since thursday , not to clock its speed but to get good pictures of it			1
a day before , scientists got a shot of its moon			2
the images look less like photos and more like ultrasound images			0
the discovery of its moon -- which makes it what scientists call a binary asteroid -- surprised the astronomers , said @entity10 radar scientist @entity85 , who helped take the images at @entity88 antenna at @entity89 , @entity90			1
more than 15 % of asteroids travel in groups of two or three objects revolving around one another , according to @entity10			1
destructive potential 1998 @entity5 's moon , which is 2,000 feet wide , is large enough for @entity10 to term it a " potential city killer			1
" the asteroid it revolves around is much bigger , at 1.7 miles wide			0
" this is one of the big ones , " @entity59 said			0
large explosion on moon visible from earth any asteroid as large as a half - mile across would cause a global catastrophe , if it struck the blue planet , he added			0
to put the potential for damage by an asteroid into perspective , the one that paleontologists believe triggered the extinction of dinosaurs on @entity6 65 million years ago was six miles in diameter			1
the meteor that exploded over @entity121 in february , injuring more than 1,000 people and causing millions of dollars in damage , was a " very small asteroid , " according to the space agency			0
the most dangerous asteroids contain a lot of stone or iron , according to @entity10			2
1998 @entity5 contains a good bit of carbon and well as amino acids , the building blocks of protein			0
the @entity54 has identified 95 % of asteroids of this most dangerous order , @entity59 said			0
luckily , there is no known possibility of one slamming into the planet			0
but @entity10 has not yet done much work on the meteors one class lower , known as the " potential city killers			2
" they start at a size of 150 yards in diameter			0
@entity10 astronomers have identified only 10 % of the 10,000 they believe pass close to @entity6			1
@entity10 officials this year told a congressional panel , which was considering future defense systems to prevent a potential asteroid strike , that there is only a one in 20,000 chance that a truly dangerous one will hit @entity6 in a year 's time			1
having a look even as it jets further and further away , astronomers will continue making images of 1998 @entity5 through june 9 with two radar antennas -- one in @entity90 and a second one in @entity163			0
amateur astronomers with telescopes as small as 10 inches long may just barely be able to see it in the southern skies			0
but their devices should be computer controlled because locating it otherwise will be difficult , @entity10 advises			2
the coordinates to locate the asteroid are on the @entity9 website			0
@entity10 takes threats from asteroids seriously , and will keep calculating the orbits of the large ones they identify long to check their flight paths for any potential danger to @entity6			1
eventually , 1998 @entity5 will curve back out toward the solar system 's outer asteroid belt , which is just short of @entity182			2
it will go by @entity6 next on july 12 , 2028 , according to @entity10 's @entity9			1
but that time there will be lots more elbow space -- the asteroid is expected to be about 45 million miles away			2
there will be a much closer call comes in about 200 years			0
even then , though , scientists believe history will repeat itself -- and our planet will once again survive			0

new : @entity198 will next pass the @entity6 in 2028
@entity200 have been anticipating the asteroid 's passing for a few years
images of it should compare well to those shot by spacecraft , @entity10 says
the asteroid " sailed harmlessly " past the @entity6 , *albeit* 3.6 million away
