@entity0 , @entity1 -- oh no , he did n't go there			0
even in a political climate where it sometimes appears that anything goes , @entity5 crossed the line			1
when the former @entity11 governor recently attacked @entity13 sen. @entity12 of @entity14 , for -- in essence -- not being @entity16 enough , or not being the right kind of @entity16 , @entity5 went too far			1
during a web interview after an appearance on @entity22 ' " this week , " the @entity18 was asked about @entity12 and said this : " i 'm not a fan			1
i know ( @entity12 is ) sort of the @entity13 latest flavor			1
he seems to be charismatic , but i do n't like his politics			2
i think he introduces a measure of incivility in the political process			0
insulting people is not the way to go			0
" then , @entity5 insulted @entity12			1
he was asked if he thought the senator represents most hispanics			2
that 's a dumb question			0
@entity12 has never claimed to represent " most hispanics			1
" besides , can you imagine someone asking if an @entity40 politician represents most @entity40 ? yet , @entity5 played along			1
" no , no , " he said			0
almost every @entity16 in the country wants to see immigration reform			1
no , i do n't think he should be defined as a @entity16			1
he 's a politician from @entity14			0
" since leaving government , @entity5 obviously has time on his hands and so he has volunteered to assume the burden of sorting through 52 million hispanics in the @entity49 and deciding which of us are authentic and which are n't			1
you have to respect the initiative			0
for the record , @entity12 does n't think that illegal immigrants should get a path to citizenship , calling it " inconsistent with the rule of law and is profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who have followed the rules and waited in line for years , and sometimes decades , to come here legally			1
" i disagree with most of what @entity12 has said about immigration			1
but i would n't say that he is " anti-immigration			0
he is the son of an immigrant			0
@entity12 ' father , @entity69 , who the senator says has been his hero his entire life , left @entity72 in 1957 at age 18			1
the elder @entity12 came to the @entity49 not speaking @entity74 , with $ 100 to his name and washed dishes for 50 cents an hour			1
i once asked @entity12 how he would solve the immigration problem			1
" no. 1 : we need to get serious about securing the border , about stopping illegal immigration , particularly in a post- 9/11 world , " he said			0
" but no. 2 , we also need to remain a nation that does n't just welcome but that celebrates legal immigrants who come here seeking to pursue the @entity49 dream			0
" that does n't sound " anti-immigration " to me			0
by the way , @entity5 's father , @entity5 , @entity5 , was raised in @entity89 and worked as an executive at @entity49 @entity91			1
he later worked for the bank in @entity93 , where he met and married @entity94 , @entity5 's mother			1
@entity5 was born in @entity1			1
by the time @entity5 made his way to @entity11 and into politics , he was n't exactly greeted with mariachis and margaritas by the politicos whose families had , in some cases , lived in the @entity11 for 300 years			1
@entity5 speaks excellent @entity102 , but he still had to convince native new @entity103 that he was authentically @entity104			2
he goes by " @entity105 " not " @entity106 , " and " @entity5 " is n't a typical @entity16 surname			1
so @entity5 should know better than to question someone else 's authenticity			1
in his eagerness to score a point for @entity112 by sniping at a rising star in the @entity13 , the @entity18 wandered into territory that should be off - limits			0
for @entity118 , this is our soft spot			2
we pull each other down , crabs in a bucket			0
and our modus operandi has n't evolved in 500 years : we always make it personal			0
we ca n't just disagree ; we discredit			0
and we do it by accusing each other of being less authentic than we are			2
the whole subject is taboo			0
on monday , during another interview , @entity5 said his comments were misinterpreted and that what he meant to say is simply that @entity12 " should n't be defined just as a @entity16 " because there is more to him than that			1
if that 's where he meant to go , he took the long way there			0
if @entity118 want to attack @entity12 , fine			1
but attack him for his policies , his politics and his public statements			2
as for the territory that is off - limits , i know it well			0
@entity146 carries me back to my freshman year in college where , 28 years ago , i indulged in an unfortunate ritual for @entity16 students			2
it might as well be called : " i 'm a real @entity16 , you 're a coconut			2
" @entity153 on the outside , but white on the inside			0
insecure about my ethnic identity , in part because i attended a predominantly white university , i lashed out at fellow @entity16 students			2
if they had conservative views , i would say they " did n't identify " and accuse them of not being @entity16 enough			2
ironically , some of the people i attacked probably spoke @entity102 better than i did			0
the whole exercise was childish , rude and wrong			0
and by senior year , when i began to challenge the liberal orthodoxy that many @entity118 worship , i got a taste of my own medicine			2
i do n't play that game anymore			0
in politics , not everyone has			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176			2

@entity176 : @entity5 crossed line by implying @entity12 not @entity16
@entity176 : hispanics hurt @entity118 by accusing one another of not being authentic
he says if you want to attack @entity12 , call him out on politics , not his authenticity
@entity176 once played authenticity game , but he says he grew up
