-- @entity2 veteran @entity1 tamed " brutal " sandstorm conditions in @entity4 to record a five - under - par round and sit one shot behind leader @entity7			1
@entity1 , who was playing his first tournament after a near six - week break from the game , battled strong gusts and swirling sand in @entity13 to shoot a bogey - free round of 67			1
the 55 - year - old , who can boast two major titles , no longer holds a @entity2 @entity18 card , but made light of the tough conditions			1
" i 'm pretty shocked , " he told the @entity22 's official website			0
" i had five - and - a - half weeks off and really did n't touch a club much			2
@entity24 and golf : par for the course for presidents " it 's one of the best rounds i 've ever played in a wind like that			2
you feel like you are eating a lot of sand			0
" the only man who had a better day than 1995 @entity36 winner @entity1 was @entity7 who recorded nine birdies alongside three bogeys			1
" i would have taken level par , " said @entity7 , who missed nearly six months of action last year due to a back injury			1
" we could n't see the ball landing on the fairways and i just tried to keep it as low as possible			0
i think i just got lucky and holed some important putts			0
putting is the most difficult thing on a windy day			2
" @entity49 @entity48 and @entity50 , from @entity51 , are two shots back from @entity7 on four - under while five players were tied on three - under , including 1999 @entity36 champion @entity54			1
why golf ( and big business ) still need @entity57 world number two @entity58 finished on one - under as did @entity62 's @entity61 captain , @entity60 , from @entity63			0
@entity58 took to social - networking site @entity65 after his opening round to complain about slow play on day one			1
he said : " to say we are pros and there 's no rough out there and we are supposed to know what we are doing , the pace of play today was a disgrace			0
" he later added : " i was referring to the general speed of play nearly every week now not any one person in particular			0
same last week ( in @entity76 )			0

@entity7 leads the @entity78 on six - under - par
@entity80 one shot *ahead* of @entity2 @entity1 as sandstorms affect day one
@entity1 describes conditions at the @entity84 as " brutal "
@entity48 and @entity50 tied on four - under with five players a further shot back
