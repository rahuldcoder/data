sgt. @entity12 is one of 12 soldiers , all members of the @entity16 - based 5th @entity15 , accused in a case that strained @entity19 relations with @entity10 after details emerged that some of the soldiers allegedly posed with dead @entity10 and collected souvenirs from the killings			1

the @entity3 charge sheet , which spells out the allegations against @entity12 , does not provide the date of the shooting , the identities of the victims or whether they were wounded			1
