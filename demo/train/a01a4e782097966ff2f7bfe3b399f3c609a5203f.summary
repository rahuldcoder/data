-- on a visit to @entity3 on tuesday , vice president @entity1 assured his hosts that the @entity5 will express concerns to @entity7 over @entity9 's recent claim of a large swath of airspace in the region			1
the @entity7 declaration less than two weeks ago has prompted a war of words between governments and flights through the contested air zone by military planes from the @entity5 , @entity7 , @entity3 and @entity20			1
" we , the @entity5 , are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the @entity26 , " @entity1 said at a news conference alongside @entity3 prime minister @entity22			1
@entity28 trip gives @entity1 chance to show off diplomatic cred " i will be raising these concerns with great specificity directly when i meet with the @entity7 leadership " on a later leg of his trip , @entity1 said			2
the uneasy situation in the sky over the @entity26 has raised fears that a midair incident could cause circumstances to spiral out of control			0
it has also fueled concern about how far @entity7 is willing to go to pursue its interests in the @entity46 and push back against @entity5 influence			2
" the @entity5 has an interest in the lowering of tensions in this vital region , as i believe all the countries in northeast @entity28 share that same interest with us , " @entity1 said			1
@entity7 is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans			2
@entity58 spokeswoman @entity57 reiterated monday that @entity59 recognizes neither the air defense zone nor @entity7 's demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area			2
@entity3 has told its airlines not to comply with the new @entity7 demands , but the @entity5 government has urged @entity5 carriers to follow @entity9 's instructions			1

@entity99 , spokesman for the @entity100 , defended @entity7 's actions in a written statement			0
@entity7 's airspace claim , he said , " is a zone of safety , not risks , a zone of cooperation , not competition			0
" @entity7 's air defense zone : what you need to know @entity7 's actions are justified by what it sees as aggressive moves by the @entity3 to lay claim to the disputed territory			2
" @entity3 's actions have seriously harmed @entity7 's legitimate rights and security interests , and undermined the peace and stability in @entity28 , " @entity99 said			0
without naming the @entity5 , @entity99 warned third countries about becoming involved in the dispute			0
" other parties concerned should also mind their words and actions , and should not do things to undermine regional stability and bilateral relations , " he said			0
" other parties should not be incited , or send wrong signals to make a very few countries go further on the wrong track , which will follow the same old disastrous road and undermine regional and world peace			0
