-- how do you like your sport ? blood , sweat , tears and a nailbiting finish , no doubt			0
but what about death ? if it were highly likely at least one competitor would die during a race , would you still watch it on tv ? or place a bet on the outcome ? and how different would your answer be if the athletes were not humans , but horses , asks animal welfare activists			1
those uncomfortable questions are unlikely to deter the 600 million people in 140 countries tuning in on saturday to watch the hardest -- and most spectacular -- horse race of its kind in the world ; @entity30 's @entity29			1
each year , around 40 thoroughbreds leap over 30 fences in a thrilling 10 - minute dash , with more than $ 300 million bet on the race in the @entity30 alone			1
part of the @entity29 's huge appeal is the difficult and unpredictable 7.24 kilometer course			1
but with that difficult and unpredictable course comes a cost -- in the last 50 years of the race , 36 horses have died before crossing the finish line			1
for animal rights campaigners , the competition is viewed as a cruel death trap			1
for organizers , and indeed the 70,000 punters attending each year , it 's the country 's biggest , brightest sporting event			1
" if you totally nullify the risk of the course , then you also nullify any element of challenge -- and the @entity29 is the ultimate challenge , " @entity51 , spokesman at betting agency @entity52 , told @entity0			1
" each of us has to look into our own souls and ask ourselves if that risk is a price we 're willing to pay , and that 's not an easy answer			0
" @entity67 betting tradition from schools , to offices , and local pubs across the country , the @entity29 sweepstake -- in which everyone is allocated a horse to bet on -- is an annual fixture			2
" it is the biggest betting event of the entire year			0
it 's a very @entity30 tradition , " @entity51 said			1
" children are brought up with it			0
i remember watching it with my grandparents and betting with matchsticks			0
" launched in 1839 , the historic race holds a special place in the public 's imagination , transcending the sports pages with its dramatic @entity92 course and flamboyant @entity94 crowd			2
and despite two horses fracturing their legs and later being euthanized at last year 's race -- including the favorite , @entity99 -- enthusiasm for the competition does n't appear to be waning			1
" the bottom line is , it has n't had a significant impact at all , " @entity51 said			0
" the betting public do n't appear to be particularly put off by the issue of horse welfare			0
" death trap ? thoroughbreds usually die by falling on one of the fences , breaking a limb , and later being put down			0
some also die from injuries during the race or heart attacks			0
" other jump races have uniform fences with a standard height of 4 foot 6 inches ( 1.4 meters ) , " @entity118 , horse racing consultant at @entity120 , told @entity0			2
" but at the @entity29 each fence is a different height , style or slant			2
the ground might be lower or higher on the take - off or landing side and all these things throw the horse 's center of gravity			2
" he said punters remained largely apathetic about horse deaths , continuing to bet in droves			2
" a lot of people are very blase about it , they do n't have any emotional interest other than monetary gain and the thrill of the race , " he added			0
" what you do n't see on tv is the horse with a broken back or a bullet in its head			0
it 's horrific to see an animal so desperate to keep up with the pack , struggling to get up on three legs with that one snapped leg just swinging round and round			2
" or ultimate challenge ? @entity92 bosses have made safety improvements to the course in recent years , including moving the starting gate 100 yards away from the noisy crowd , and padding the fences with softer materials			1
" we 're working very hard to reduce injuries , but unfortunately you can never totally reduce risk , " the race course 's managing director , @entity163 , told @entity0			2
" horse deaths are part - and - parcel of life in general			0
a horse can get injured just as easily exercising in a field			0
" @entity173 's six - star luxury hotel ... for horses @entity163 stressed how well cared - for the thoroughbreds were by dedicated teams of trainers , stablehands and jockeys			1
similarly , jockey @entity180 , who finished third on @entity181 last year , told @entity183 's @entity182 this week that the horses were looked - after " better than some children "			1
asked if he thought the public had been put off by nine horse deaths in the last 10 years , @entity163 pointed to the huge numbers still watching the race every year			0
" eleven million people watched it on the @entity192 last year -- more than the football , which is supposed to be our national sport , " he said			0
" it suggests that the @entity29 remains extremely popular and there 's no sign of that decreasing			1
