@entity0 -- a cache of e-mails believed lost when @entity6 's last manager 's laptop disappeared could become key evidence in the wrongful death trial against @entity9			1
lawyers for @entity6 's mother and three children do n't know what they 'll find in @entity15 's e-mails , but they are hoping it will support their contention that @entity15 was beholden to the concert promoter and not to @entity6			1
@entity6 changed managers twice in the last three months of his life			2
in late march 2009 , he hired @entity21 -- one of his father 's friends -- to replace @entity24 , the manager who initially negotiated the deal with @entity9 for his " @entity27 " tour			2
@entity6 lawyers argue that @entity9 forced @entity6 to take @entity15 , who had worked for him off and on for decades , as his manager in may 2009 because they did not want to work with @entity21			1
their contention is part of their larger argument that @entity9 executives were liable for @entity6 's death because they hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity34 , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
@entity9 counters that it was @entity6 who chose and hired @entity34 , not them			2
@entity9 lawyers argue that @entity6 was responsible for his own death and that drug addiction led to his bad decisions			1
choreographer : @entity9 considered pulling plug on @entity6 's comeback the coroner ruled his death , which came near the end of preparations for a series of comeback concerts , was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol that @entity34 was using to treat @entity6 's insomnia			1
@entity9 contends its executives had no way of knowing the doctor was using propofol in the privacy of @entity6 's bedroom			1
the @entity59 are seeking billions of dollars in damages , equal to what @entity6 might have earned if he had not died on june 25 , 2009			0
the @entity0 trial began three weeks ago and is expected to continue into july			0
the lawsuit contends @entity9 ignored warning signs about @entity6 's health in his last weeks , and instead of getting him help they pressured @entity6 and @entity34 to have him at rehearsals			1
@entity15 would have been part of that pressure , they contend			0
" get him a bucket of chicken , " @entity15 said on june 19 , 2009 , in reply to concerns about @entity6 's weight loss , makeup artist @entity74 testified last week			1
" it was such a cold response , it broke my heart , " @entity74 said through tears			0
the next day -- june 20 , 2009 -- @entity15 left a voice mail on @entity34 's cell phone			2
" i 'm sure you 're aware he had an episode last night			0
tomorrow , i 'm on my way back			0
i 'm not going to continue my trip			0
i think you need to get a blood test on him			0
we got to see what he 's doing ? " @entity95 calls @entity6 ' a pedophile ' @entity15 's e-mails were recovered after what the judge called " a lot of red tape and kind of cloudiness , " that included the @entity9 's lawyers also representing the estate of @entity15 , who died in 2011 , in fighting the @entity59 ' subpoena for them			1
" because ( @entity15 's widow ) did n't have litigation counsel , we 're representing her for the limited purposes of responding to that subpoena , " @entity9 's lead lawyer , @entity107 , told the judge			1
soon after an @entity113 court ordered @entity15 's estate to give his laptop and e-mails to the @entity6 lawyers , the @entity9 lawyers -- in their other capacity representing the @entity15 estate -- reported that they could not locate the computer or e-mails			1
@entity6 lawyers , however , learned that the @entity15 estate 's previous lawyer -- @entity126 lawyer @entity125 -- kept a copy of the e-mail files			1
for the past several weeks , however , the @entity9 lawyers argued he had no authority to provide them to the @entity59 ' lawyers for use in the case against @entity9			2
but in a phone call to the court this week , @entity125 said he advised @entity15 's widow , @entity136 , that " in my opinion , it was a conflict " for @entity9 's lawyers -- from the @entity0 firm @entity140 and @entity141 -- to represent her in the matter			1
witness : ' everybody was lying ' after @entity6 died " she said that she never signed anything with @entity140 and @entity141 to authorize them to represent her , and as of this moment they are not representing her anymore , " @entity125 said			0
@entity136 then rehired @entity125 , which allows him to send the e-mails on to the @entity59 -- after removing any that are personal or not relevant to the case			0
" i think i can give the court my assurances that i 'll go through the documents that i have and i 'll go through the e-mails , and anything that is related to the subpoena , i would obviously turn over , " @entity125 said			0
as for the missing laptop , there was a simple explanation			0
@entity136 " had told me her daughter had given it to a friend who needed a computer , " @entity125 said			0
" it was n't a very new computer			0
" while the @entity6 lawyers wanted to explore how @entity9 's lawyers came to represent the @entity15 estate in @entity113 , the judge declined exploring the matter			1
" all we know right now they 're not representing her , and that 's enough for us , " judge @entity174 said			0
the trial 's fourth week starts monday morning with @entity9 's chief counsel , @entity179 , on the witness stand			2
@entity6 lawyers are expected to grill him about the contract negotiations with @entity6 and @entity34			2
witness : @entity6 was paranoid , talking to himself in last days			0
