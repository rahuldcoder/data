-- @entity2 intelligence agencies are on alert for new @entity5 terrorist plots following the arrest of two men at an @entity9 port and investigations into the activities of an alleged @entity5 network based in @entity13			1
@entity14 officiated at the wedding of @entity16 ( pictured ) , who became an @entity5 " icon			1
" the two are closely tied to a @entity13 - based @entity5 recruiting network , @entity20 counter-terrorism officials have told @entity0			1
they are @entity14 , 62 , and @entity23 , 33 -- and they were detained in the port of @entity25 on november 11 last year after allegedly trying to smuggle three @entity26 and two @entity27 into @entity9 in the false bottom of a camper van they were driving			1
now they face much more serious allegations following a counter-terrorism investigation by @entity9 , @entity35 and @entity20 police			1
@entity9 authorities have officially charged them with being leaders of a logistical support team for @entity5			1
a bug planted by @entity9 police in the suspects ' detention facility picked up snatches of conversation about an alleged scheme to attack @entity46 in @entity47			1
a partial transcript of one of their alleged conversations has now been released			2
" i 'll hit @entity52 , " @entity23 tells @entity14			2
" we 'll hit it there , " @entity14 replies			2
" at night when there will be a lot of people			2
" later in the conversation they appear to discuss buying grenades off contacts in the @entity63			2
@entity35 authorities have said that they were never aware of a concrete plot to attack the airport			2
@entity9 suspects well known to @entity20 security services @entity14 and @entity23 were detained after @entity9 authorities allegedly found @entity70 propaganda in their possession when they arrived on a ferry from @entity73			1
@entity20 police say they alerted @entity9 authorities that the pair were known extremists			1
@entity14 is a naturalized @entity35 cleric of @entity27 descent , and in the early 1990s had founded the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) , an organization @entity20 authorities say espoused hard - line @entity80 and pro @entity5 views			1
@entity23 , described by @entity9 police as a computer expert , was the main administrator of the @entity78 's web site in @entity20			1
in 2006 @entity23 and @entity14 's son @entity85 were convicted in @entity20 for posting threatening anti-semitic messages on the site			0
their prison sentences were later reduced to a fine by an appeals court			0
a @entity20 counter-terrorism source tells @entity0 that the @entity78 has clandestinely continued its operations in @entity20			0
when @entity0 reporters visited its headquarters on the @entity98 in @entity13 in february , @entity95 appeared to still occupy the premises			1
in previous interviews with @entity20 journalists , @entity100 said his organization concentrated on pastoral care for muslims in @entity13 and did not promote pro-al @entity5 views			1
in april 1999 @entity14 officiated at the wedding of two protégés at @entity78 , @entity109 and @entity16			0
the couple would later become " icons " of the @entity5 movement , according to @entity20 counter-terrorism officials			1
two days before 9/11 , @entity109 assassinated @entity115 , the head of the @entity117 , in a suicide bombing operation in @entity119			0
after his death @entity16 , a @entity20 citizen of @entity122 descent who had accompanied him to @entity119 , returned to @entity2 and founded @entity123 -- a web site promoting @entity126 's @entity125			1
in a @entity0 interview in 2006 el @entity16 demonstrated how she and her new husband @entity128 ran the site , which contained postings of attacks on coalition troops in @entity133 and translations of the speeches of @entity5 leaders			1
alleged recruitment for training in @entity139 according to @entity20 police @entity140 and @entity128 moved to @entity13 in 2007 and worked in tandem to recruit operatives to train in the tribal areas of @entity139			1
@entity146 , it is alleged , inspired young men to volunteer for @entity125 through her incendiary web postings			2
@entity128 , the police say , went out to the streets to recruit people			0
@entity146 was arrested last december in @entity13 and charged along with five others with participation in a terrorist group			1
@entity146 and @entity128 allegedly recruited six individuals in all , four from @entity20 and two from @entity35 , according to legal documents obtained by @entity0			0
those documents include the interrogation report of one of the @entity35 recruits who traveled to @entity139 and was arrested when he returned to @entity2			1
the recruit , who can only be named by his initials @entity167 , told @entity35 authorities that several members of their traveling group including @entity128 , were given explosives training by @entity5 trainers in @entity139 's @entity175 tribal areas early in 2008			1
during the two - week course , according to the legal documents , @entity167 alleged that @entity179 and @entity27 instructors taught them how to assemble weapons , fire rocket launchers , and how to handle explosives			2
one trainer even set off a small charge of @entity186 in demonstration , telling them that the explosive was used to attack @entity191 convoys in @entity119 and in suicide vests			0
@entity20 security services went on high alert after members of the group started to return from the tribal areas in late 2008 , concerned they might have been tasked to launch attacks in @entity2			1
according to [ @entity20 ] counter-terrorism sources , the trigger for the @entity13 arrests was an intercepted e-mail sent by one of the alleged recruits , @entity203 , in early december shortly after he returned to @entity20			1
the e-mail allegedly suggested that @entity203 had been given the green light to launch an attack in @entity20			0
however no explosives were recovered by @entity20 police , and some terrorism analysts are skeptical that an attack was imminent			0
@entity203 's lawyer @entity212 told @entity0 the email was merely " tough talk " to impress an ex-girlfriend			0
@entity20 authorities continue to insist that the alleged cell was a potential national security threat			0
the alleged role of @entity14 and @entity23 a senior @entity20 intelligence source told @entity0 that @entity14 and @entity221 -- the two men detained in @entity9 -- were known to provide ideological support for members of the alleged @entity13 terrorism network , but at this time were not suspected of having played a direct role in recruiting young @entity228 for training in @entity139			1
questions on their role , however , have been raised by a new revelation by @entity9 investigators , who allege that when they were arrested , @entity14 and @entity23 were carrying the last will and testament of @entity203 , whose e-mail had caused such alarm			1
in the alleged will @entity203 made clear he was ready for martyrdom			0
" when you hear of my death ... do n't wear black and most importantly do n't display my photo , " @entity203 purportedly wrote			0
" i will emigrate to the field of @entity125 to triumph for the religion of @entity243 , to defend the @entity95 countries and to protect the sacred lands of the @entity228			0
and i will be a great help to the @entity248 brothers			0
" @entity212 told @entity0 that such a document in no way indicated that his client was preparing an attack in @entity2			2
[ he said @entity203 had traveled to the tribal areas of @entity139 to fight with the @entity254 in @entity119 , not to become an @entity5 operative ]			2
" writing a will was hardly unusual behavior for somebody whose aim was to go and fight jihad in @entity119 , " @entity212 said			0
according to @entity20 counter-terrorism officials , @entity14 's @entity78 and @entity16 's web site served as focal points for many of those linked to the alleged @entity13 network			1
the officials say that , @entity14 , @entity23 , @entity140 , @entity128 and @entity203 belonged to a tight - knit 20 - 30 strong community of militants in @entity13			1
@entity0 , through its own investigation and through @entity20 legal and police sources , has identified the user names under which several of these individuals , including @entity23 , @entity128 and @entity203 posted messages on @entity277 's site @entity278			0
continued security concerns according to @entity20 counter-terrorism officials , three of the seven individuals who traveled to the @entity119 - @entity139 border region in 2008 for training are still at large in the area			2
some @entity2 counter-terrorism officials believe this is a significant security concern , given the @entity13 network 's track record in smuggling people into @entity2			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity289 , the director of @entity290 said : " every secret service will tell you that individuals who are already radicalized and who are in addition are being specialized in some fighting techniques or techniques of propaganda are representing a big risk when they come back			0
" those still at large , @entity20 counter-terrorism sources say , include @entity128 , ( @entity16 's husband ) who they believe has developed close ties with the top leadership of @entity5 in the border region between @entity139 and @entity119			2
@entity20 counter-terrorism officials told @entity0 that @entity128 was in regular email contact from the region with his wife before her arrest last december			2
according to a lawyer briefed on the legal dossier in the @entity20 case , in june 2008 @entity128 allegedly sent @entity140 an e-mail claiming to have killed five @entity191 in @entity119			0
his wife congratulated him , according to the legal source			0
@entity128 also purportedly posted messages on @entity316 's radical web site from the border region between @entity119 and @entity139 , including a message posted last september urging militants in @entity2 to launch attacks			2
" the solution my brothers and sisters is not fatwas but boooooooms , " the posting stated			0
the posting was discovered by @entity0 under @entity128 's purported user name on the @entity329 web site			0
earlier this week @entity128 purportedly posted a new statement on @entity123			0
in the message which was entitled " we need you " he said he had joined up with @entity254 forces who were making raids against @entity191 troops in @entity119 from the tribal areas of @entity139			0
" the @entity125 is going well and the @entity254 are stronger than ever , they are gaining territory every day and more important than that they are winning the trust of the local population , " he claimed			0
but @entity128 purportedly also had this sobering message for @entity20 authorities : " if you thought that you could pressure me to slow down through the arrest of my wife you were wrong			0
it wo n't stop me fulfilling my objectives ... those who laugh last , laugh more			0
