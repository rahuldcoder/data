-- a high - speed passenger train derails as it rounds a curve , killing dozens and injuring scores more			1
that scene played out wednesday in @entity6 , leading @entity8 residents to ask , " could it happen here ? " the answer : not likely , not now , if only because there 's precious little high - speed rail in the @entity8			1
also , the train that crashed near @entity15 is an extremely complicated machine , nothing like any train in the @entity8 , said @entity20 assistant professor @entity19			1
" from the @entity8 public 's point of view , i think it 's important for them not to be scared or panicked about this , " said @entity19 , whose research expertise lies in railway operations			1
" i could never imagine such a complicated piece of equipment running in @entity30			0
" where the @entity8 , like most of the world , has a standard track width of 4 feet , 8.5 inches , the @entity6 train was designed to run on both that gauge and on wider tracks that are used in much of @entity6 and @entity36 , @entity19 said			1
" the wheels on this train actually move , so you can imagine the complexity that adds , " he said			0
@entity6 's high - speed @entity42 trains run on a different voltage than other trains in the country , so this train 's electrical system was outfitted to adapt to multiple voltages and signal systems , and because parts of @entity6 have no electric wires , the train was designed with a diesel engine so it can run on both electric and nonelectric tracks			1
" it 's an enormously complicated train , nothing like the @entity8 or @entity30 continent has ever seen , " @entity19 said			1
in the crash video , he said , " the train looks like it peels off the track between the diesel engine and the first coach			0
" this is the weakest juncture in the train , he said , because the coach car is far lighter than the engine			0
@entity30 's slower locomotives while @entity19 said there are routes between @entity70 and @entity71 and @entity70 and @entity72 where trains can top 100 mph ( the @entity6 train was reportedly running about 118 mph ) , the closest the @entity8 has to high - speed rail is the @entity76 that runs between @entity77 and @entity78 at advertised speeds of up to 150 mph			1
but that 's a bit misleading , some say			0
the trains rarely travel that fast because along many stretches the tracks are n't rated for that kind of speed			2
@entity89 announced in september it plans to run test trains at 165 mph in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			2
" they 're operating on tracks and going through tunnels that are 100 years old , " said @entity96 , a transportation expert at the @entity97			2
while @entity76 trains could potentially derail , @entity102 requirements demand they be heavier than similar trains in @entity105 , making them less likely to fly off the tracks , according to an excerpt from " waiting on a train : the @entity110 , " posted on the publisher 's website			2
speed limits enforced by the agency also keep the trains moving slower than their powerful engines allow , further reducing the risk of an accident			2
those limits are necessary because of curves , small tunnels and freight traffic along the same tracks , according to the book , written by @entity126			0
" the high - speed corridors in @entity105 and @entity128 are straight , level , sealed from intrusion , and set aside solely for fast passenger trains , " @entity126 writes			1
" to create such a corridor in the @entity133 with its dense population would cost tens of billions of dollars and require the purchase or condemnation of more land and neighborhoods			0
" the curves , traffics and tight tunnels may actually make @entity8 trains safer , @entity19 said , because engineers have to pay more attention , especially since there 's far less automation in @entity30 trains than in @entity105 ones			1
" human factors play a big role , including the risk of oversight due to boredom			0
the @entity155 is curvy with frequent speed changes , so engineers there never have a chance to get complacent or bored			0
they are constantly braking and accelerating , " he said			0
" we do n't have this level of computer control			0
in most places in the @entity8 , the engineer 's in the cab			2
he 's watching visual signals outside the cab			0
" @entity30 trains also have an auto - stop feature , so if an engineer misses a stop or caution signal , either inside or outside the cab , the brakes are applied automatically			2
slow progress for high - speed rail high costs and political opposition have led to limited success for efforts to bring widespread @entity105 - and @entity184 - style high - speed rail to the @entity8			1
president @entity185 used the 2009 economic stimulus package to dole out $ 8 billion for high - speed rail projects , and in 2011 proposed spending $ 53 billion over six years to promote construction of high - speed lines around the nation			1
more than two years later , there 's been little progress			0
while the federal government offered money to spearhead high - speed rail efforts in states such as @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 , @entity202 governors in @entity197 and @entity199 killed the projects			1
in @entity200 , voters in 2008 approved a 520 - mile high - speed rail project that would have carried riders between @entity207 and @entity208 at nearly 200 mph			1
since then , the cost estimate has gone up , speeds have come down and the route has been limited to a roughly 200 - mile stretch between @entity213 and @entity214			2
now , the attention appears to be turning to state and local initiatives			0
a private company has proposed a line in @entity220 , while another private proposal would bring high - speed rail linking @entity223 and @entity224 , @entity199			1
but for high - speed rail to make significant inroads into the @entity8 , the nation would first have to make significant improvements to basic infrastructure , such as tracks and bridges to allow freight and passenger traffic to coexist , said @entity97 ' @entity96			1
" we 've got a long way to go , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

high - speed trains are not widely available in the @entity8 , though some can top 100 mph
expert : the @entity6 train is " enormously complicated , " nothing like @entity8 trains
the @entity247 regulates @entity8 train speeds and other safety measures
efforts to expand high - speed programs have met with little success in @entity8
