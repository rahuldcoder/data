-- @entity2 's symptoms were subtle at first , almost imperceptible -- a headache now and then , a little dizziness in the first week of september			1
a healthy 78 - year - old circuit court judge in @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity2 did n't want to go to the doctor , and he certainly did n't seem terribly ill. as usual , he worked more than a full day every day except sunday , and walked at least three miles			1
but then on september 9 , @entity2 became confused while teaching his regular sunday school class at the @entity6 @entity10 and had to stop partway through			1
two days later , he went to pick up his newspaper and fell over onto the sidewalk			0
he said he could n't feel his legs , and his daughter rushed him to the emergency room			0
fearing he 'd had a stroke , doctors at @entity17 sent him by ambulance to @entity20 in @entity21 , where an @entity22 confirmed he had indeed had a stroke			2
@entity2 died five days later , his death attributed to a combination of old age and bad luck			1
at his funeral , @entity7 chief justice @entity28 eulogized @entity2 , remembering his 20 years on the bench and his 23 years as a state prosecutor			1
@entity2 's granddaughter played a hymn on the piano , and he was buried at the @entity41 , with @entity42 , his wife of 55 years , their two children , five grandchildren , and one great - granddaughter in attendance			1
as she sat in the church , @entity2 's daughter , @entity43 , could n't get something out of her mind			1
she 's a nurse , and while her father was at @entity20 , not one but several doctors took her aside and told her his stroke was in a part of the brain where strokes hardly ever happen -- and when they do , it 's in patients with severe , prolonged high blood pressure			1
the judge 's blood pressure was normal , even a little low			1
" this is the strangest stroke i 've ever seen , " they told her			2
' bitter , angry , and heartbroken ' right now , doctors in 23 states are looking back at medical records to reconsider whether deaths that looked routine might actually have been caused by contaminated medicine from the @entity67			2
" there will be people who gradually come to light -- people like this judge , " says dr. @entity68 , an infectious disease specialist at @entity20 who 's been working with the @entity72 @entity71 and the @entity73 during the outbreak			1
what is a compounding pharmacy ? @entity2 died on september 17 , more than a week before doctors -- and the rest of the world -- learned about the contaminated shots			1
then , three weeks later , @entity2 's son - in - law , @entity85 , read a short article online in the @entity88 newspaper , which said a 78 - year - old man was the first to die in the meningitis outbreak			1
the date of death was listed as september 17 at @entity20			2
@entity43 called @entity2 's widow , @entity42 , immediately			1
it must be @entity2 , he said -- how many other 78 - year - old men could have died at @entity20 on september 17 ? but no one from @entity20 or the state department of health had reached out to the family			1
then @entity42 remembered receiving a telephone call a week after her husband 's death from someone at the @entity103 in @entity21 , where her husband had had three steroid injections for neck and back pain over the summer			1
the caller wanted to know how " @entity2 " was doing			1
" i said , ' well , brother @entity2 passed away , ' and they said they were sorry and everything , and that was the end of the call , " @entity42 remembers			1
" then the next day i got a call from the same number and it was a different individual			0
she wanted to know about his symptoms and whether an autopsy had been done			0
" steroid injections common for back pain sufferers @entity42 thought the calls were a little odd -- she wondered why they were inquiring about her husband 's health nearly a month after they gave him the injections			1
the callers never mentioned the words " fungal meningitis , " she says , even though the connection between the shots and the disease had been made by that time			2
@entity0 tried through e-mails and phone calls to get answers from the @entity103 , but did not receive a response			0
only after reading the @entity88 article did @entity42 put it all together			0
the @entity103 received 2,000 vials of tainted steroids , and some 1,000 patients received the injections between june 6 and september 6 , according to the @entity145			2
@entity2 received his three injections in july and august			1
" i 've been bitter , angry , heartbroken , and grief - stricken , " @entity42 says			0
@entity20 reported @entity2 's death as one of four " suspected " cases of meningitis , according to hospital spokesman @entity151			1
a strict judge , a loving grandfather some 14,000 people may have received shots of contaminated medicine from the @entity67 , according to the @entity73			1
since it can take as long as seven weeks for symptoms to show up after a patient receives a shot , it 's possible some of them are experiencing symptoms such as headaches and dizziness and have n't connected them to the shots they received			2
meningitis outbreak : what you need to know " it 's important to make that connection , because the earlier you treat this , the better , " says dr. @entity171 , vice chairman of the @entity172 at @entity20 , who has treated patients in this outbreak			1
that 's why @entity180 says she 's speaking out -- she does n't want anyone else to suffer the way her husband did			2
@entity2 and @entity184 were college sweethearts and married 56 years ago this december			2
she worked as a lab technician while he attended law school at the @entity189 , graduating in 1960			0
" those were rough years			0
we did n't have money or anything , but they were good years , " @entity42 remembers			0
after graduation , @entity2 went to work as an attorney for the city of @entity6 and then as a county and state prosecutor			2
he was a circuit court judge from 1992 until he passed away , and was named @entity201 in 1995			0
@entity2 worked seven days a week , cutting down only recently to six			2
" he loved the law , " @entity42 says			0
" he was the most intelligent man i 've ever met , " his son , @entity203 , says			0
" if you needed advice , regardless of what the subject was , you could always take his and trust it and rest assured that things would work out			0
" the lawyers who argued cases before him remembered how well prepared he was -- and that his decisions were rarely reversed by appellate courts			0
@entity216 : more issues with drugs from @entity220 facility " he believed in proper courtroom decorum and had a respect for the legal system and for the office he held , " @entity221 , an @entity6 lawyer , wrote in an article in the @entity223			0
" he will be remembered as one of the most influential figures in our county 's history			0
" @entity2 's family remembers him as a loving father , grandfather , and great - grandfather			1
he sometimes took his granddaughters to work with him , letting them play with their @entity242 dolls quietly behind him on the bench while he heard cases			0
@entity2 's term as judge would have ended in two years , and he had planned on opening a law practice with one of those granddaughters , @entity248 , who recently graduated from law school			1
" he was really looking forward to that , " @entity42 says			0
" he had many more years -- good years			0
" now the entire family has to figure out how to live on without the man they describe as " the center of our universe			0
" " i was married when i was 19			0
i do n't remember what it 's like not to be married , " @entity42 says			0
" it was such a useless death			2
" @entity0 's @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .			0

judge @entity2 *initially* was thought to have died of a stroke
his family now believes he contracted meningitis through contaminated injections
other cases will " gradually come to light , " one doctor says
@entity2 's wife says his death was " useless "
