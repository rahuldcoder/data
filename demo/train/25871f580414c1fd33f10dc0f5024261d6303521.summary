designer @entity0 is making model - related headlines again			1
the last time this happened , it was when the iconic @entity6 brand digitally altered model @entity7 into a biologically impossible state , rendering her waist and pelvis in miniature and leaving the rest of her body normal - sized			1
@entity15 critics noticed and spoke up			0
it did n't help matters when @entity18 herself stated that she was allegedly fired by the brand for being " too fat " by fashion world metrics			2
more recently , however , the @entity0 brand has made attempts to improve its image and hired @entity27 plus - size model @entity25 , who stands 6 - foot - 2 and wears a size 12 , for a print campaign			1
after the public relations nightmare with @entity18 , many have heralded this choice as a positive sign of improvement in a fashion industry that overwhelmingly hires and promotes models who are far thinner than the average @entity6 woman			0
we asked , you answered : are we really ready to take a look at ' real women ' ? as is often the case when any plus - size model makes news , many are eager to hold this up as a victory for " real women , " that anonymous majority who so rarely get to see themselves portrayed in fashion images			1
but do n't get too enthusiastic with the back - patting just yet			2
this is not a revolutionary moment , any more than it has been any other time a mainstream designer has plucked a nonwaifish model from the depths of the plus - size - modeling dungeon and made her , however briefly , a public curiosity			1
fashion is famously fickle , and if @entity0 has chosen to showcase this particular model at this particular moment , it may have nothing to do with making some grand political statement or a significant change of heart and everything to do with generating buzz			1
of course , i ca n't know the brand 's intentions for certain			2
but in the larger context , even widespread use of plus - size models does n't signal the evolution of a movement away from the impossible feminine physical ideal ; it 's just taking that ideal and making it a tiny bit bigger			1
it is the business of both fashion and its models to represent fantasy , and even plus - size versions are regularly digitally altered			1
like their smaller peers , these models also have their skin smoothed , their waists and thighs whittled and their many human imperfections , from cellulite to flyaways , fully erased long before their image ever hits the side of a bus or the page of a magazine			0
even plus - size models are still perfectly proportional and almost impossibly beautiful			1
they still present an aspirational standard that is unattainable if only because the resulting image does n't resemble the real - life model			2
' @entity104 ' bloggers find beauty in all sizes so @entity25 is slightly more accessible than @entity18			0
this is like observing that it would be easier for us to flap our arms and fly to the moon than it would be to fly to @entity112 ; the moon might be closer , but we 're still not going to get there			0
and neither are the vast majority of @entity6 women			0
there 's nothing wrong with fantasy			2
@entity121 is fun , and the fashion industry does it as well as @entity124			0
why ca n't we relate to fashion images for what they are -- imaginary worlds with beautiful people who do n't really exist ? why insist that they represent reality in some way ? why are we so in love with the idea of seeing " real women , " whatever that represents ? we 've all seen what happens when actual " real " bodies make news			0
the most recent whipping girl for the crime of failing to be perfect is @entity143 , whose recent photos from a concert in @entity146 have had practically everyone on the planet hypothesizing how she could allow herself to suffer such a horrible fate as to put on a few pounds			1
critics and fans have suggested everything from drug abuse to pregnancy			0
@entity143 , for her part , simply credits eating a lot of tasty food at her father 's restaurant			2
' half ' : one woman 's struggle with weight loss @entity143 has unashamedly shown off her body onstage in spite of her changing weight , refusing to apologize , and the response has ranged from shock , to disgust , to " concern , " to schadenfreude - driven laughter			1
@entity143 has since responded by launching a new section on her website entitled " @entity174 , " kicking things off by sharing pictures of her own body ( and acknowledging the eating disorders that have shaped her ) while soliciting fans to share their own insecurities			1
it is telling that the initial public response was not to applaud @entity143 for being " real , " but to shame her for being imperfect			2
we do n't like to be reminded of how much effort it sometimes takes to meet the ideal , even for those whose profession hinges on maintaining a certain appearance			0
we like to think it 's easy and natural ; we like to think anyone who fails at it just did n't try hard enough			0
but real bodies , like reality itself , are complicated and diverse , as well as unpredictably changeable			0
for all our vocal support in favor of seeing so - called " real women , " we forget that all women are real , no matter their size or their shape or their age or whether they are conventionally attractive			2
the biggest problem with this nebulous concept of " real women " and our desire to see more of them is that it is intrinsically hypocritical			0
the truth is , we want to see " real women " when they look like @entity25 in a @entity0 ad , coiffed and digitally altered into that brand 's iconic and immaculate horse - riding fantasy world			1
we do n't want to see " real women " when they look like us			0
maybe that 's the disconnect we ought to be working on , instead of applauding @entity0 's choice of models on one side while condemning @entity143 for being , well , " real " on the other			1
do you think the public really wants to see non-model types in ads and entertainment ? share your thoughts in the comments section below .			0
