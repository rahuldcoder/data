archaeologists working alongside builders on a new @entity3 rail link have turned up a grisly find that harks back seven centuries , to a time when @entity7 stalked the medieval city			1
a shaft sunk for the underpinnings of the new @entity13 link in @entity14 revealed 13 skeletons , lined up neatly in two rows , the company said friday			1
suspicions are that the dig has revealed a " plague pit " -- one of many mass graves used to dispose of the bodies of those who succumbed to the @entity7 , or bubonic plague , in the 14th century			1
since then , the bones have lain undisturbed just 2.5 meters ( 8 feet ) below the surface in one of the few areas of the central @entity3 neighborhood not to have been developed over the years			1
historical records talk of a " @entity30 " established in 1348 in the @entity14 area , where some 50,000 plague victims were buried , according to a contemporary historian			1
up to now the area has never been found			0
the shaft sunk as part of @entity13 's construction is located on the edge of @entity39 in @entity14 , formerly the site of a monastery			1
@entity13 's lead archaeologist , @entity41 , quoted in a company media release , said it was " a highly significant discovery , " and one that left many questions still to answer			1
" we will be undertaking scientific tests on the skeletons over the coming months to establish their cause of death , whether they were plague victims from the 14th century or later @entity3 residents , how old they were and perhaps evidence of who they were , " he said			1
body found under parking lot is @entity58 , scientists confirm " however , at this early stage , the depth of burials , the pottery found with the skeletons and the way the skeletons have been set out , all point towards this being part of the 14th century emergency burial ground			1
" the pottery found with the skeletons dates to before 1350 , the archaeologists said			2
the skeletons are being excavated and taken to the @entity73 for further testing			2
scientists hope to extract a dna profile that could be used to study the development of plague since then			0
however , there is no risk to people 's health now because the plague bacteria can not survive long in the soil , @entity13 says			1
eventually , the shaft will be sunk 20 meters deep to support the @entity13 tunneling works			2
the archaeologists may turn up other unexpected finds as they dig back through soil packed down over centuries			2
the yersinia pestis bacterium that is behind the plague is found mainly in rodents , particularly rats , and in the fleas that feed on them , the @entity92 website says			2
each year , roughly 10 to 20 people in the @entity100 develop plague from flea or rodent bites , mostly from infected prairie dogs in rural southwestern areas , the @entity92 says			0
about one in seven of those infected dies			0
no person - to - person transmission has been recorded in the past 90 years			0
in the 1300s , the @entity7 killed an estimated 20 million to 30 million people in @entity110 , the @entity92 says			0
another 12 million fell victim to the scourge in @entity113 in the mid- 19th century , and smaller outbreaks have occurred elsewhere			2
once completed , the @entity13 route will run 73 miles from east to west across @entity3 , improving access to @entity117 , central @entity3 and towns to the east			1
@entity3 services could start as soon as 2018			0
opinion : after @entity58 , can we find @entity123 ? according to the company , it is currently running the country 's largest archaeology program			0
other finds turned up in the course of excavations for the rail route include bones from prehistoric animals , @entity133 and @entity135 tools , and the largest piece of amber ever uncovered in @entity138			0
archaeologists also found a former cemetery in excavations near @entity142 , where 300 skeletons were found			0
those are thought to have been buried between 1500 and 1700			0

archaeologists working for @entity3 's @entity13 project find 13 skeletons in 2 neat rows
they are thought to have been buried in the mid- 14th century amid a plague outbreak
the area excavated in central @entity3 has lain undisturbed for centuries
plague bacteria are still carried by some rodents and the fleas that live on them
