@entity0 -- as the story goes , @entity2 spent six days creating the world and then rested on the seventh day			1
he told the @entity6 people to always rest on the seventh day of each week , which was to become known as the sabbath for them for eternity			1
this was before @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , of course			2
@entity17 did n't have friends who would get upset if texts were n't returned promptly , parents who wanted to know where their children were all the time or bosses who had complete access to their employees via work - issued devices			2
there is no excuse good enough to ignore the boss , even on a weekend			2
but one group is trying to take back the sabbath : reboot -- a nonprofit organization aimed at reinventing the traditions and rituals of @entity37 for today 's secular jews			1
composed of @entity44 entrepreneurs , creators of award - winning television shows , community organizers and nonprofit leaders , these " @entity48 " are people who typically have their cell phones glued to their palms			1
several of them go so far as to say they have an addiction to their devices			2
they pledged to observe 24 hours of freedom from their devices this past weekend : a @entity56 , lasting from sundown friday to sundown saturday , the @entity59			1
the day was to launch @entity33 's ongoing project , the @entity56			1
@entity61 , a @entity62 and founder of the @entity65 web site , created the @entity56 because he felt that technology was taking over too much of his life			1
" there 's clearly a social problem when we 're interacting more with digital interfaces than our fellow human beings , " @entity61 said in an e-mail to @entity1			1
" @entity75 , engaging conversations are harder to come by than they were a few years ago			2
our attention spans are silently evaporating			2
" the @entity56 consists of 10 principles			1
however , people are encouraged to discuss online which principles work and which should be tweaked			0
as they stand now , the guiding principles are : 1			0
the @entity56 specifically promotes the first principle			1
even though reboot is technically focused on reaching out to hyper - connected @entity6 , the values behind the @entity56 are meant for all denominations , @entity61 said			1
" we believe that everyone can benefit from a respite from the relentless technology			1
unplugging on a weekly basis wo n't provide a magical solution to these issues , but it 's a start ... a chance to catch our breaths , replenish our souls and reconnect with the living , breathing people we love			1
" it may sound like a nice idea , but how realistic is the concept ? can people live without their beloved technology for 24 hours ? " no , " said @entity111 , 22 , without missing a beat			1
" the problem is , i live in @entity114 and work here [ @entity116 ]			0
i have to contact my friends in @entity114 to make plans			0
i 'm not just going to go all the way there and then they 're not home			0
" some people are able to remember a simpler time before cell phones			1
" this is new for me , " said 26 - year - old @entity125 , laughing and waving her @entity14			0
" i remember even before cell phones , when you had to make plans with someone beforehand and meet them there			1
if you were late , you were late			0
" walking around @entity116 , though , it is hard to find people without a phone of any kind in their grasp			0
as @entity138 , 27 , pointed out , everyone in the city is working			0
the bosses need to stay in touch with you			0
asked if he would answer a call from his boss at 10 at night , he said no. why not ? " i 'm sleeping ! " his friend , @entity145 , 30 , would also have a hard time without his phone , but for a slightly different reason			0
" definitely not on a friday night			0
we have to make plans			0
maybe on a monday or tuesday , " he paused			0
" not monday , because if you meet a girl over the weekend , you want to call her on monday			0
so maybe tuesday or wednesday			0
" there is one piece of irony to the whole thing			0
@entity158 , 42 , said she can easily go a day without using her phone			2
asked if her friends and family would get frustrated by not being able to call or e-mail her , she laughed			0
" i would first put up a @entity12 status to say i 'll be off my phone and computer for 24 hours			2
" reboot also recognizes the irony that it has been promoting the @entity56 largely using social - networking sites			1
however , the group was asking people not to log on to their sites in the 24 - hour window starting friday evening at sundown .			2
