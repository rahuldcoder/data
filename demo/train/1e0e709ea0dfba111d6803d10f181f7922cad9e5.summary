@entity0 -- the @entity2 has taken the first steps toward repealing the military 's controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy regarding gay and lesbian service members , defense secretary @entity4 said tuesday			1
laying the groundwork for a repeal of the policy will take more than a year , @entity4 said			1
in the interim , however , the @entity2 will start enforcing the policy " in a fairer manner , " he told members of the @entity16			1
president @entity17 called for a repeal of the policy during last week 's @entity21 address			1
@entity23 chairman adm. @entity22 also endorsed a repeal tuesday , telling the committee it is his " personal belief " that " allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly [ in the military ] would be the right thing to do			1
" " for me , personally , it comes down to integrity , " he said			0
" the question before us is not whether the military prepares to make this change , but how we best prepare for it , " @entity4 told members of the @entity16			1
" we have received our orders from the commander in chief and we are moving out accordingly			0
" but the ultimate decision on whether to repeal the policy , he acknowledged , rests with @entity43			1
the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , enacted under president @entity53 in 1993 , bars openly gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving in the @entity48 military , but prevents the military from asking a service member 's sexual orientation			1
it has been a political lightning rod since its implementation			1
" i am mindful ... that attitudes towards homosexuality may have changed considerably -- both in society generally and in the military " since 1993 , @entity4 said			1
to prepare the military for what has been a long - anticipated change , @entity4 said he has already appointed a " high - level " working group to " immediately begin a review of the issues associated with properly implementing a repeal			1
" " the mandate of this working group is to thoroughly , objectively and methodically examine all aspects of this question and produce its finding and recommendations in the form of an implementation plan by the end of this calendar year , " @entity4 told the committee members			1
" a guiding principle of our efforts will be to minimize disruption and polarization within the ranks , with special attention paid to those serving on the front lines			0
" the working group will be led by @entity2 general counsel @entity88 and gen. @entity89 , commander of @entity90 , @entity4 said			1
the group will " reach out to the [ military ] ... to authoritatively understand their views and attitudes about the impacts of repeal , " he added			1
" i expect that the same sharp divisions that characterize the debate over these issues outside of the military will quickly seek to find their way into this process			0
" @entity4 noted that the @entity2 will ask the @entity104 to update a study it conducted in 1993 on the impact of allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military			1
he also said he has directed the @entity2 to " quickly review the regulations used to implement " the law and , within 45 days , present possible changes that will allow for more humane enforcement			2
the secretary acknowledged the impatience many political observers and activists may have with the timetable for a repeal			2
" i expect that our approach may cause some to wonder why it will take the better part of the year to accomplish this task , " he said			2
" we looked at a variety of options , but when you take into account the overriding imperative -- to get this right and minimize disruption to a force that is actively fighting two wars and working through the stress of almost a decade of combat -- then it is clear to us that we must proceed in a manner that allows for the thorough examination of all issues			0
" in a @entity1 / @entity138 poll in april 2009 , 48 percent of @entity48 favored maintaining the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
thirty - seven percent opposed the policy because they believed it treated homosexuals too harshly , while another 8 percent opposed it because they believed it treated homosexuals too leniently			2
" ' @entity148 ' to many people , including myself , seemed so reasonable , " @entity146 , a former army intelligence officer discharged for being gay , told @entity1 's " @entity150			0
" " i knew i was gay going in , and i knew about ' @entity148 , ' but you know , ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' as a sound bite sounds very reasonable			2
it sounds like nobody will inquire as to your sexual orientation -- as long as you do n't throw it in anyone 's face , you wo n't have a problem			2
" but after i got in , i realized that ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' was much more all - inclusive and all - encompassing , " said @entity146 , who now is the executive director of @entity161 , an advocacy group that opposes the policy			1
" it was more like ' do n't ask , do n't tell , do n't happen to be found out any time , any place , in any way			2
' " after about a year , @entity146 said his sexual orientation was found out within his unit			2
" that information spread , and then the command was forced into a corner in which they had to discharge me , " he said			0
watch @entity146 talk about his experience since the policy was implemented , more than 13,500 service members have been discharged , according to rep. @entity175 , @entity176			2
in 2009 , there were 428 discharges under the policy -- the lowest rate of discharge since implementation of the policy , he said			1
the highest year was 2001 , with 1,227 discharges , he said			2
" this shows that during wartime , @entity148 is not being pursued aggressively because one 's orientation has nothing to do with their ability to fight , " @entity175 said in a written statement monday			0
defense officials have said privately that the will to enforce the law is declining			2
another military official familiar with the discussion said some of the issues to be considered by the military include the cost of implementing a new policy , benefits for gay spouses , potential hate crimes , and even logistical questions such as the possible need to renovate barracks to separate straight and gay troops			2
according to the official , separate housing or showers were not considered serious possibilities , but would be discussed in order to be ruled out			0
@entity146 acknowledged there are legitimate concerns , but said some of the issues raised , such as showers and housing , are merely delaying tactics used to mask " reasons that people really do n't want to see this happen			2
" at least one member of the @entity23 -- gen. @entity224 , commandant of the @entity225 -- has expressed reservations in the past about repealing the law			1
" our @entity225 are currently engaged in two fights , and our focus should not be drawn away from those priorities , " @entity224 said in november through a spokesman			0
watch how @entity23 are dealing with the change most of the committee 's republicans strongly criticized a potential repeal tuesday			1
" elections have consequences , " said @entity240 sen. @entity239 , referencing @entity17 's promise to end the policy			1
but " we 'll have a debate about this			0
" sen. @entity248 , @entity249 , a former @entity250 pilot , said one of the keys to @entity48 military power is " good order and unit cohesion , and ... any practice which puts those goals at unacceptable risk can be restricted			0
" @entity248 argued that while " do n't ask , do n't tell " has not been perfect , it has been effective			0
" it has helped to balance a potentially disruptive tension between the desires of a minority and the broader interests of our all - volunteer force , " he said			0
" it is well understood and predominantly supported by our fighting men and women			0
it reflects , as i understand them , the preferences of our uniformed services ... while still allowing gay and lesbian @entity48 to serve their country in uniform			0
" but other military veterans support the change			0
retired gen. @entity280 , former chairman of the @entity23 , said it is time to repeal the law			1
" as a nation built on the [ principle ] of equality , we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger , more cohesive military , " @entity280 wrote in a letter to sen. @entity284 , @entity286 - @entity285 , who supports repealing the policy			1
@entity294 of the @entity295 said the real test will be in the barracks , with the rank - and - file members of the military			0
" we can talk about this delicately or we can just be fairly direct , " @entity294 said			0
" there are a lot of 18 - year - old , old - fashioned , testosterone - laden men in the military who are tough guys			0
they 're often politically old - fashioned or conservative ; they are not necessarily at the vanguard , in many cases , of accepting alternative forms of lifestyle			0
" @entity146 predicted the matter will become a " non-issue , " saying his organization knows of gays serving openly in the military now			1
asked whether he would return to the military if the policy is repealed , @entity146 said he would not hesitate and that he has wanted to return since his discharge in 2002			0
" i speak five languages , including @entity322 , " he said			0
" there 's nothing more that i 'd love than to go back right now			0
" @entity1 's @entity325 contributed to this report .			0
