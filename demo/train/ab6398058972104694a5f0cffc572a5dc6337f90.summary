-- a secretly taped video by a male and a female posing as sex traffickers purportedly shows a @entity7 employee in @entity8 telling them how to secure abortions and contraception for underage girls , anti-abortion activist @entity1 told @entity0 wednesday			1
in response , @entity7 described the january 13 video by @entity1 's anti-abortion group @entity16 as a scheme to " take down " the abortion - rights organization , @entity7 spokesman @entity13 said in a statement			1
in a @entity0 interview , @entity13 added @entity7 has already reported the claims of sex trafficking to federal authorities and on tuesday fired the videotaped employee			1
@entity7 of @entity25 also condemned the apparent misconduct of the employee			1
" the behavior of our employee , as portrayed on the video , if accurate , violates @entity35 policies , as well as our core values of protecting the welfare of minors and complying with the law , " @entity28 , ceo of @entity7 of @entity25 , said in a statement			1
last month , @entity16 activists with secret cameras visited two @entity7 health centers in @entity8 , where human trafficking has been a major issue , @entity13 said in a statement			1
after the visits were over , @entity7 notified local authorities of alleged human trafficking and learned of at least 11 visits to facilities in six states over one week " in which persons claiming to be involved in sex trafficking with minors asked for services for young women , " according to @entity7 statements			1
@entity7 then notified federal authorities , and the @entity59 is reviewing photos of at least one person making the sex trafficking claims , @entity13 said			1
there was no immediate confirmation from the @entity59 that a review was underway			0
in the visits , men , sometimes accompanied by a woman , appear at @entity7 without an appointment saying they were seeking health services , but they quickly turn the conversation to a supposed sex ring they claim to be managing , according to a @entity7 statement			1
" if a multistate sex trafficking operation is in place , those responsible must be pursued to stop the exploitation of girls and young women , " @entity13 said in a statement			1
" if these visits are part of a ' dirty tricks ' campaign , they must be condemned			0
falsely claiming sex trafficking to health professionals to advance a political agenda is an astoundingly cynical form of political activity			0
" @entity1 -- president of @entity90 - based @entity16 and , according to the organization 's website , a student at @entity94 -- said the video from january shows two individuals portraying a pimp and a prostitute			1
in the past 3 1/2 years , group members have gone " undercover " in a total of 11 @entity7 clinics , she said			2
" these are actors , and they investigate sexual abuse cover - up going on across the country institutionally at @entity7 clinics , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" this is the 11th clinic where it shows the worker aiding and abetting who they think is a pimp , a sexual abuser who commercially exploits young girls			0
" in the @entity0 interview , @entity1 , 22 , did not detail what happened in the 10 other visits			0
she said she participated in an unspecified number of the undercover visits			0
in the video , an female employee at @entity7 's facility in @entity123 , advises the couple to have the underage girls lie about their age to avoid mandatory reporting laws for abortion			1
" even if they lie , just say , ' oh , he 's the same age as me , 15 , ' ... it 's just that mainly 14 and under we have to , does n't matter if their partner 's the same age , younger , whatever , 14 and under we have to report , " the @entity7 employee says in the video			1
the employee also tells the male that he can get cheaper contraception by claiming the girls are " students , " according to the video			2
" if they 're minors , put down that they 're students			0
yeah , just kind of play along that they 're students			0
we want to make it look as legit as possible , " the @entity7 employee says on the video			1
the employee cites another abortion provider to the couple in case an underage girl needs an abortion , according to the video			2
" their protocols are n't as strict as ours , and they do n't get audited the same way that we do , " the @entity7 employee says on the video about the other abortion provider			1
@entity16 said it sent the entire video to @entity165 attorney general @entity164 , @entity8 attorney general @entity166 , the @entity59 and other law enforcement officials			2
@entity0 could not immediately verify that claim			0
" this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that @entity7 intentionally breaks state and federal laws and covers up the abuse of the young girls it claims to serve , " @entity1 said in a statement			2
@entity1 pointed out to @entity0 that @entity7 receives federal funding and added : " these clinics need to be defunded			0
young girls are at risk			0
" @entity7 spokesman @entity13 said the video posted on the @entity16 website was edited and was shot with a secret camera by @entity16 activists on january 13			1
" the group that has undertaken this secret taping is on the record as saying its goal is to ' take down ' @entity7 over the next 10 years by creating ' controversy ' in the organization and making @entity7 ' not feel safe , ' " @entity13 said in a statement			2
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity13 added that the videotaped employee 's immediate firing " is as clear a message you can deliver " that @entity7 has " zero tolerance " for misconduct			2
" @entity16 is an extreme political group and their goal is to take away health care from women , to end abortion in the @entity165 , " @entity13 said			0
" there is no training that can prevent this from happening			0
this is a complete breakdown in judgment : we do n't know understand what happened with this employee			0
" a statement on the @entity215 website said that " these secret video tapings of our health centers are being coordinated with anti-choice groups who are pressing for the passage of the federal @entity222 bill to defund @entity7			0
" this bill would deny federal funds for family planning and preventive care to @entity7 , the largest provider of reproductive health care to women in the @entity165 , " the statement by @entity215 in @entity224 said .			0
