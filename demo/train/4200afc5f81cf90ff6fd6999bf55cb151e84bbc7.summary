-- worshippers at an @entity4 center in @entity5 , @entity6 , will have to wait at least a week before they can use their new mosque , officials said thursday			1
the mosque -- subject of a two - year battle marked by legal wrangling , vandalism and anti-muslim sentiment -- still needs to pass inspection and get its occupancy permit , mosque officials said			1
" it is unfortunate that we can not be in our building for the start of @entity22 tonight , " @entity17 officials said in a written statement			2
" however , it does look like we will get to enjoy most of @entity22 in our building , especially the breaking of the fast at the end of @entity22 , on @entity26			2
" the release said it will take about 10 days to complete the next legal steps			1
" they do have a lot of work to be done cosmetically , " said @entity29 , @entity30 director , told @entity0 affiliate @entity31			1
" we have gone through the building with them " and made suggestions , he added			2
on wednesday , a federal judge in @entity39 ordered @entity40 to conduct a final inspection on the building , setting aside a local judge 's ruling from june that voided a planning commission 's approval			2
if the structure fails to comply with inspection requirements , @entity48 district judge @entity47 ordered the county to immediately notify the @entity52 of any deficiencies and " promptly reinspect the building " after the center informs the county it has corrected the problems			2
embattled mosque moves forward with construction @entity60 , who is opposed the mosque , told @entity0 affiliate @entity62 on wednesday that the issue was never about someone 's right to worship but rather about whether the planning commission gave proper public notice			1
" i do believe in our system			0
i believe in due process , " he said			0
" you have to respect the system , even if you disagree sometimes with the decision it makes			0
" @entity76 , one of the leading opponents of the mosque , said she was n't surprised by the ruling and never thought her group would win the court case			1
she said she just wanted to show @entity82 that they are not welcome in @entity5			0
faced with the fact that the mosque is likely to be opening soon , @entity76 said she hopes it does n't bring " 1,000 to 2,000 @entity82 families here			1
" she plans to keep up the fight , and said the controversy has drawn the community closer together			1
" everyone else feels the same way i do ( about the mosque ) except the 5 % who moved here the day before yesterday , " she said			1
feds investigate fire at site of future mosque @entity98 of the @entity52 said the congregation has a three - decade history and has not caused any disruption in the city			1
" no one can come to say the @entity4 community is radical , " he told @entity0			1
" what did we do ? " @entity107 , 31 , said she thinks local opinions on the issue are a reflection of town demographics			0
the population is split equally into two groups , she said : those who have moved to @entity5 -- mostly for @entity115 or to commute to nearby @entity116 -- and those whose families have been there for decades			0
" people who have been here forever have a very one - sided , ignorant viewpoint of what a mosque coming to @entity5 would mean , " she said			1
the graphic designer , originally from @entity123 , has been living in the suburban town for 10 years			1
she said @entity123 has a large @entity82 population and she grew up with that as a normal part of the culture			0
two years ago , the mosque was the talk of the town , but at least for her circle of friends and family it has become a fringe issue , she said			1
why do @entity82 pray 5 times a day ? a municipal worker who lives near the mosque said most of the residents in her neighborhood are more concerned about the traffic than the @entity82 presence			1
but for the majority of the town it 's the term " @entity82 " that counts , she said			0
the 69 - year - old , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue and her connection to local government , said she thinks any religious group has a right to be there and she does n't feel threatened			0
" it 's just the way @entity82 are perceived because of the terrorist attacks and the war , " she said			0
" we have @entity158 here and they have their place of worship and i do n't think anything 's ever been said against them			0
" what 's bothering this 11 - year @entity5 resident the most is the discord it 's brought to her town			0
" it 's just a mess and it 's brought terrible publicity , " she said			0
" it 's a wonderful city and town , but the news is not going to portray that			0
" the issue is widely discussed among local residents and some people near her have even put their houses up for sale , she said , because they do n't want to be near a @entity82 congregation			2
the fight erupted in 2010 when planning commissioners approved an expansion project			2
the construction site has been vandalized several times , including by an arson attack in 2010 , and federal authorities have charged a @entity193 man with calling in a bomb threat to the center before last year 's anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity198 and @entity199			2
" not welcome " was spray - painted by vandals on a sign announcing the construction of the project			0
@entity98 said the mosque 's opening will be another opportunity to extend " hands of peace " and thank supporters			1
" i believe we are all related , we all came from @entity212 , " the imam said			0
" we might have some disagreement , but we must find a way to sit at the table , have a discussion and respect each other			0
" my faith : after my mosque was torched @entity0 's @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			2
