@entity0 the men would sometimes say they needed to meet to exchange tickets , but they never seemed to end up actually attending or discussing a sporting event or a concert			1
they once talked about going to a movie			0
the reason for the puzzling behavior , according to a federal complaint unsealed monday , is that the men were @entity13 spies exchanging intelligence information in @entity0			1
they used tickets and other everyday objects -- like books , umbrellas and hats -- as part of their code			1
when they did meet , on dozens of occasions between early 2012 and late 2014 , it was usually outdoors in order to lower the risk of surveillance			0
at the short meetings , one man would hand a bag , a magazine or a slip of paper to another			2
but the @entity36 was watching and listening to them			1
on monday in @entity0 , authorities arrested one of the men , who they say had been working as a covert agent for the @entity13 government			1
he was identified as @entity44 , 39 , who posed as an employee in the @entity0 office of a @entity13 bank , according to the federal complaint			0
the man he met regularly for the handoffs was @entity53 , 40 , who worked as a trade representative for the @entity13 government in @entity0 , the complaint says			2
a 27 - year - old man serving as an attache to @entity13 's mission at the @entity59 , @entity60 , is also alleged to have been part of the conspiracy			0
all three men are accused of working for @entity13 's foreign intelligence agency , the @entity64			1
@entity53 and @entity60 , who no longer live in the @entity66 and have n't been arrested , both had diplomatic immunity because of their jobs for the @entity13 government			1
but @entity44 , who entered the @entity66 as a private citizen , was operating under what officials called " non-official cover			1
" agents like that , known as " @entity80 , " generally receive " less scrutiny by the host government , and , in many cases , are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government , " a statement from @entity66 law enforcement authorities said			1
" as a result , a noc is an extremely valuable intelligence asset for the @entity64 , " the statement said			0
@entity44 needed the other two men to get mesages to and from the communications systems kept in the @entity64 's office in @entity0 , according to authorities			1
as he was undercover , he could n't go near the office			0
the subjects about which the men were tasked with gathering intelligence are believed to have included possible @entity66 sanctions on @entity13 and @entity66 efforts to develop alternative energy resources			1
@entity53 and @entity60 also tried to recruit @entity66 citizens as intelligence sources in @entity0 , the complaint said			1
their targets included people working for " major companies " and " young women with ties to a major university located in @entity0 , " according to authorities			0
the @entity36 says in its complaint that its surveillance of the men heard them discussing various aspects of their work			1
in one conversation , @entity60 is alleged to have talked about his technique for recruiting sources , which included " cheating , promising favors , and then discarding the intelligence source once the relevant information was obtained by the @entity64 , " according to authorities			1
but in another discussion , he apparently complained to @entity123 about how unexciting his everyday job was , saying it was " not even close " to @entity127 movies			0
" of course , i would n't fly helicopters , but pretend to be somebody else at a minimum , " he said			0
@entity53 seemed to concur , lamenting , " i also thought that at least i would go abroad with a different passport			0
" the two men also chatted about the 2010 unmasking of a @entity13 spy ring in the @entity66			1
in that case , 11 intelligence personnel , living and working in the @entity66 as " sleeper " agents , were arrested and later allowed to return to @entity140 as part of a spy swap			1
according to the complaint , @entity60 suggested those agents " could n't do anything			0
" " they studied some people , worked out some exits , but they did n't get any materials , " he said			0
the @entity36 investigation into @entity44 , @entity123 and @entity60 began " within a few months " of the guilty pleas in the 2010 case , according to the @entity36			2
a source working for the @entity36 met with @entity44 in the summer of 2014 , posing as a representative of a wealthy person wanting to invest in the casino business in @entity13			2
over the course of the meetings , @entity44 " demonstrated his strong desire to obtain information about subjects far outside the scope of his work as a bank employee , " authorities said			2
he also accepted documents that the source claimed had come from a @entity66 government agency and " purportedly contained information potentially useful to @entity13 , including information about @entity66 sanctions against @entity13 , " according to the @entity66 law enforcement statement			1
prosecutors announced charges monday against @entity44 , @entity123 and @entity60 on two counts			0
the first is participating in a conspiracy for @entity44 to act in the @entity66 as an agency of a foreign government without first notifying the attorney general , which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison			2
in the second count , @entity44 is charged with acting in the @entity66 as an agent of a foreign government without first notifying the attorney general , while @entity53 and @entity60 are charged with aiding and abetting that offense			2
the maximum sentence for that count is 10 years imprisonment			0
the charges and @entity44 's arrest " make clear that — more than two decades after the presumptive end of the @entity191 — @entity13 spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy , " said @entity66 attorney @entity194			2
a federal judge in @entity202 on monday ordered that @entity44 be detained because he was considered to pose a flight risk , the @entity200 said			0
his federal public defender , @entity204 , spoke to the @entity205			0
she declined to comment on the charges other than to say that she had argued for bail because @entity44 was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community , the newspaper reported			0
@entity1 's @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
