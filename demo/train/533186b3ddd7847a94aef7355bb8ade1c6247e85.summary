-- in february 2002 , when the @entity4 administration 's campaign to win support for invading @entity6 was gathering steam , defense secretary @entity1 was asked at a news conference about insinuations that @entity10 was in cahoots with @entity12 , a collaboration for which there was no evidence			1
@entity1 's response may not have been illuminating , but it was certainly memorable			1
" reports that say that something has n't happened are always interesting to me , " he said , " because as we know , there are known knowns ; there are things we know we know			1
we also know there are known unknowns ; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know			0
but there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we do n't know we do n't know			1
" as we approach the 10th anniversary of that invasion , @entity1 's musings provide a helpful reminder for members of the news media			1
when the next war debate comes , our first step ought to be to take careful stock of what we know and what we do n't			1
journalists regularly have to take crash courses in new subjects			0
when the economy imploded in 2008 , many of us who write about public affairs found ourselves addressing economic matters in greater detail than ever before			0
to write intelligently about health care reform in 2009 , you had to get up to speed on how things such as the health insurance market and @entity58 work , and a hundred other details			0
when a new topic is inherently opaque -- such as the internal politics of a country most journalists could barely find on a map , or the complex consequences of starting a war in a region where @entity69 foreign policy is widely reviled -- we should know more than ever about our own personal known unknowns and unknown unknowns			2
opinion : did @entity73 give birth to the @entity75 ? that did n't happen in 2002 and 2003			1
the campaign to sell the @entity73 was a carefully planned and skillfully executed propaganda effort , and it succeeded because so many journalists and news outlets went along for the ride			1
to be fair to the news media , they were up against an administration using diabolically clever techniques			1
to take just one example , in the fall of 2002 , the administration leaked a story to the @entity90 ' @entity89 claiming that @entity6 had purchased aluminum tubes clearly intended for use in centrifuges to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons			2
the truth , as we later found out , was that there was no @entity6 nuclear program , and the tubes in question would have been virtually useless for one			0
they were meant for conventional rockets			0
but the administration knew the exclusive would be too juicy for @entity89 to pass up			2
her credulous account , passing all the administration 's false claims on as a " scoop , " appeared on the @entity90 front page on september 8			1
vice president @entity114 then went on " @entity115 " that very day and said , " it 's now public that in fact he has been seeking to acquire , and we have been able to intercept and prevent him from acquiring , through this particular channel , the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a centrifuge			0
" so the administration planted a false story in the @entity90 , then cited the false story on @entity125 , using the @entity90 ' imprimatur to bolster its credibility			2
that is some @entity130 - level media manipulation			2
@entity131 : why invading @entity6 was a terrible mistake every major news organization , from national newspapers to television networks to magazines , was complicit to some degree in selling the public a brief of false information , from @entity10 's allegedly terrifying arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to the fictional links between the @entity6 government and @entity12			1
it was n't that you could n't find journalists questioning the official story , raising doubts about the administration 's claims , and doing the hard work to determine what the truth was			1
whenever there 's a story that the media as a whole get wrong , there 's always a reporter somewhere who got it right			2
the problem was that those voices were so much quieter , pushed so far to the edge of the national debate			0
even within some publications there was a tension			0
one of the journalistic heroes of the pre-war period was @entity173 national security reporter @entity172 , who reported the lack of evidence for the administration 's hype			2
but his articles were buried deep within the paper , while the front page blared scary stories about the fearsome threat from @entity6 and the @entity173 's editorial page beat the drums for war			2
asked later why his stories were shunted to the back pages , @entity172 responded , " @entity188 was scared			0
" opinion : why the war in @entity6 was fought for @entity191 and so were much of the media			1
when there 's a war in the offing , the flags are waving and dissenters are being called treasonous , the media 's courage tends to slip away			1
which is particularly regrettable , since the time when the government is pressing for war should be the time when they are more aggressive than ever , exploring every possibility and asking every question , over and over again if need be			0
that 's the time when government is most likely to dissemble and deceive			0
that was when we most needed the press , and when its failure was the most costly			0
so the next time people in power propose a new war -- and they will -- journalists need to ask some important questions			0
what are the limits of our understanding of this country we might invade ? what are the motivations of the people pushing for the action ? what evidence is the government offering to support its claims ? are there knowledgeable people who disagree , and what are they saying ? which of the government 's claims have i investigated myself , and which am i taking on face value ? what are the potential consequences of military action , good and bad , and have i explored them in enough detail ? and in the context of @entity6 , which questions do i wish i had asked last time around ? that 's just a start , of course			0
perhaps lessons have been learned , and the next time a president warns the @entity69 people that we have no choice but to invade another country or risk our doom , the press will do a better job of being skeptical , thoughtful and rigorous than it did 10 years ago			1
it could n't do much worse			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			1

@entity265 : @entity1 remarks in push for @entity73 were *classic* *doublespeak*
he says reporters , who are supposed to be quick studies in new areas , were credulous
he says savvy @entity4 administration easily duped press into selling case for war
@entity265 : all news media *guilty* but hope is that they learned from , wo n't repeat mistake
