-- a pregnant bartender says she is fighting to keep her job at a gentlemen 's club in @entity5			1
@entity6 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , claims her employer , @entity9 , discriminated against her because of her pregnancy			1
she filed a claim with the @entity12 earlier this month			0
@entity6 says she feared how her boss would react to her pregnancy and wanted to wait a few months to tell him			1
however , @entity15 found out before she could tell him , and that 's when @entity6 claims her job became threatened			1
up until she became pregnant , the 29 - year - old says she had been one of the club 's most popular bartenders			0
read the complaint she says she " bonused 9 times " since august and it was only toward the end of her pregnancy that she asked for different hours			1
due to the tough economy , @entity6 says she needed this specific bartending job and feared she 'd soon be out of work			1
to protect herself , she decided to secretly record her boss on tape			0
on those recordings @entity15 can be heard saying , " customers do n't wan na come in and see a pregnant woman behind the bar ! " these recordings were also submitted in her @entity12 discrimination claim			1
in other recordings , @entity15 is heard suggesting that @entity6 's appearance is hurting business			0
" maybe they do n't go there because the bartender is pregnant and does n't look sexy			2
" workplace attorney @entity42 said it 's within @entity15 's right to do this if employees were informed that they had to maintain a specific " sexy look " to qualify for the job			0
in this case , that means @entity6 would have had to be hired as a " model and a bartender " and get a written agreement to this -- as is done in the casino industry , @entity42 said on @entity56 with @entity57			2
when asked by @entity57 if she signed any paperwork of that sort , @entity6 said , " not at all ... nothing			0
" @entity6 was taken off the bartending schedule for a few weeks , during which she hired an attorney			2
she later returned to the club as a cashier but claims she made much less than she did as a bartender			0
however , @entity15 's attorney says this proves she was never fired and her job duties were only adjusted to accommodate her pregnancy			1
" my client declines to comment on pending legal action except to say it considers that ms. @entity6 allegations are without merit , " attorney @entity71 said in a statement			2
" ms. @entity6 was not terminated from her employment , she presently is on maternity leave and she has the right to return to work upon the conclusion of her leave			0
" @entity6 is due to have a baby girl this week .			0
