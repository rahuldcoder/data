@entity0 , @entity1 -- thirty years ago this summer , @entity3 learned the name @entity5			1

@entity12 , who runs an environmental justice group , shows a photo of children from @entity5 protesting			1
troubles at the local elementary school -- and health problems among its students , such as seizure disorders -- were among the first signs of a much larger problem that made news around the world and prompted federal @entity27 legislation to clean up the most polluted sites in the @entity3			1
despite the outcry over @entity5 , little has been done to make schoolchildren safer from hazardous or toxic waste , says @entity12 , who headed the @entity32 and now runs the @entity33			1
" we should be farther along today than we are , " said @entity12 , who started the nonprofit a year after her evacuation from @entity5			1
the organization is dedicated to helping communities facing environmental threats			2
a 2005 study by the @entity33 looking at just four states -- @entity42 , @entity1 , @entity43 and @entity44 -- found half a million children attending schools within half a mile of known toxic dumps			1
@entity12 points to @entity48 in @entity42 as an example of children at risk			2
@entity52 opened in 1972 on top of a former burn dump for @entity55 , an industrial chemical linked to cancer and brain damage			1
@entity55 levels in the body build over time , raising health risks			2
" like a lot of teachers there now , i figured , how bad could it be ? i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 , " said former @entity52 teacher @entity66 , who is now cancer - free			2
she is returning to the classroom this fall but will not go back to @entity52			2
former teacher @entity69 also says @entity52 made her ill. " i became very , very sick			2
my immune system shut down			2
i collapsed and was bedridden for several months , " @entity69 said			2
her health improved after she left the high school , she says , and she has now retired			2
@entity74 , who worked in the cafeteria , says she compiled a list of 25 school employees who died of cancer			0
three classrooms were closed last year because of high @entity55 levels , but the school has been scrubbed and a new ventilation system added			0
the rooms are expected to be open this fall			0
there have been no reports of students at the high school becoming sick as a result of the toxic waste			1
" i would n't have kids in the school if i did n't think it was safe			0
i would close the school , " said mayor @entity94 , whose two sons attended @entity96			0
@entity55 levels inside the school now fall within federal guidelines , he says			0

" i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous , " he said			0
only seven states have laws preventing cities and towns from building schools on or near toxic waste , according to the @entity113			1

" you can go most anyplace and build [ a school ] on top of a @entity27 site , " @entity12 said			0
" they can build a school anywhere they want , really			0
and that 's the sad truth			0
i think at schools , very little has changed , and that 's unfortunate			1
" even in states with laws , many are weak or poorly enforced , she says			1
in @entity42 , state law prevents schools only from being built close to active waste dumps , which would not have prevented @entity52 's construction three decades ago on a former dump site			1
in @entity0 , @entity12 ' home was built three blocks from 20,000 tons of industrial waste placed in barrels and buried in a mile - long ditch by a plastics and chemical maker			1

@entity12 , married with two young children at the time , recalls elementary school students playing with ooze bubbling up on the playground			0
" the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them , " @entity12 said			0
" so , for example , one of these things was phosphorous rocks			0
phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface			1
the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks , and when you threw them at a hard surface , they would explode like a firecracker			0

@entity12 says neighborhood children also played with the chemical @entity172 , a pollutant associated with skin irritation , nausea , convulsions -- even death			1
" i have a high school education			0
i do n't have a science degree , but you do n't have to be a scientist to know that 20,000 tons of chemicals and kindergartners do n't mix , " @entity12 said .			1
