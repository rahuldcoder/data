-- every day millions of women apply lipstick without a second thought			0
what many do n't know is that lipsticks may contain lead , the notorious metal that can cause learning , language and behavioral problems			1
lead is a neurotoxin and can be dangerous even at small doses			2
so what 's lead doing in lipsticks ? not all lipsticks contain lead , but a number of studies in recent years show that the metal is more prevalent than previously thought			1
in 2007 , the @entity22 conducted a study -- " a @entity23 " -- that detected lead in 61 % of the 33 lipsticks tested , with levels ranging from 0.03 ppm to 0.65 ppm			1
parts per million ( ppm ) is the measurement of lead in the environment			2
medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the blood			1
the @entity36 says it does n't consider the lead levels it found in lipsticks to be a safety issue			1
no lipstick lists lead as an ingredient			2
the amounts are small , but the presence of lead in lipstick , which is ingested and absorbed through the skin , raises concerns about the safety of a cosmetic product that is wildly popular among women			1
urged on by both consumers and the cosmetics industry , the @entity36 conducted its own testing in 2010			1
the @entity36 's results were even more astonishing : the agency detected lead in all 400 lipsticks tested , ranging from 0.9 to 3.06 ppm -- four times higher than the levels observed in the study done by @entity22			1
and lead is n't the only toxic metal you may be applying to your lips			2
in a recent study , @entity65 researchers tested eight lipsticks and 24 lip glosses and detected nine toxic heavy metals , including chromium , cadmium , manganese , aluminum and lead			1
the @entity36 said , " we have assessed the potential for harm to consumers from use of lipstick containing lead at the levels found in both rounds of testing			1
lipstick , as a product intended for topical use with limited absorption , is ingested only in very small quantities			0
we do not consider the lead levels we found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern			1
" likewise , the cosmetics industry also does n't see this as an issue , saying that the dose makes the poison -- in other words , the trace amounts of heavy metals in lipsticks are not harmful			1
but the @entity36 noted , " although we do not believe that the lead content found in our recent lipstick analyses poses a safety concern , we are evaluating whether there may be a need to recommend an upper limit for lead in lipstick in order to further protect the health and welfare of consumers			1
" indeed , what the @entity36 and the cosmetics industry have been ignoring is cumulative exposure and potential long - term adverse effects			1
it 's true that a single lipstick application will not lead to harm			0
and the good news is that not all lipsticks contain detectable levels of lead or other heavy metals			2
( and by the way , cost does n't seem to be a factor ; a cheap or expensive lipstick is n't the determinant of how much lead is present			0
) the problem is when women who wear lipstick apply it two to 14 times a day , according to the @entity65 study			0
the result is that they are ingesting and absorbing through their lips as much as 87 milligrams of product a day , the study says			0
women are not only applying their lipsticks several times a day , but they also are doing this in the span of a whole lifetime , which means that exposure to lead and other heavy metals adds up and can potentially affect their health			2
one challenge for people wanting to avoid exposure is that none of the metals , with the exception of aluminum , are deliberately added to lipsticks and lip glosses			0
the metals are contaminants that are present in the pigments and base materials used to make the products			0
because the metals are not ingredients , cosmetics companies are not required to list them on products ' ingredient labels			0
the law regulating cosmetics passed @entity171 in 1938 and has never been updated			1
the @entity36 possesses no legal authority to make sure products are safe before they are sold			2
nor is the agency empowered to pull dangerous products from store shelves			0
it 's the @entity178 for cosmetics companies , which have very few rules restricting chemical ingredients used in everything from shampoos to lotions to lipsticks			2
as the contamination of lip products with heavy metals makes it clear , allowing the industry to police itself is not the best idea			0
we need the @entity36 to be empowered by @entity171 and to take action so women wo n't face any health risks when they put on makeup			1
cosmetics companies should be required to adhere to a standard for best manufacturing processes to limit metal contamination			0
for now , consumers should take precautions to protect themselves from heavy metal exposure from lip products			0
if you find yourself reapplying lipstick 14 times a day , consider cutting back			0
second , do n't let children use lipstick , as their young bodies are especially vulnerable to toxic metals			0
then let 's get to work to make sure that by the time they 've grown up , we have solved the problem of toxic chemicals in cosmetics .			0

@entity222 : studies found higher level of lead in some lipsticks
@entity222 : this raises concerns about the safety of a popular product
she says @entity36 and cosmetic industry should *pay* attention to long - term effects
@entity222 : @entity171 needs to update the laws regulating cosmetics
