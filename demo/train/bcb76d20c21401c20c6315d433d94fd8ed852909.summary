@entity0 -- one of the the country 's most powerful unions stepped up its campaign for a hotly disputed labor bill monday , holding a rally on the eve of the bill 's formal introduction in @entity10			1
workers rally in support of the @entity13 in @entity14 in @entity0 on monday			1
the legislation -- the @entity13 -- would create an alternate process for bringing a union into a workplace			1
it is supported by president @entity20 and the @entity22 congressional leadership , but is fiercely opposed by most congressional @entity23 and corporate leaders , who fear it will saddle a sagging business community with new burdens at the worst possible time			0
business leaders " believe in this old market - worshipping , privatizing , deregulating , trickle - down [ policy ] that took the greatest economy on the @entity35 and sent it staggering forward because of their greed and their selfishness , " declared @entity30 president @entity29			0
" without the @entity13 ... the rich will get richer and the rest of us will fend for ourselves			1
" sterns issued his warning as his 1.8 million - member union prepared for a daylong @entity48 lobbying blitz on behalf of the bill tuesday			1
democrats and @entity23 may disagree sharply over the merits of the legislation , but leaders on both sides of the aisle freely admit it has the potential to significantly reshape the balance of power between business and labor for the first time in years			0
the controversial act would allow employees to signal support for unionizing by openly signing a card demanding it			1
if a majority signed , the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate union representation			1
it would also stiffen federal laws barring employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union			1
the traditional option to vote by secret ballot would still be available			0
but critics say the measure -- dubbed the " card check " bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections , removing a fundamental hard - earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they do n't want to join			1
some corporate leaders have reacted angrily against the measure			0
if a retailer has not gotten involved with fight over this bill , he " should be shot , " @entity87 , co-founder and former ceo of @entity89 , said during a conference call about the act last october			1
retailers who do n't speak out against it " should be thrown out of their goddamn jobs			0
" " this is how a civilization disappears , " @entity87 said			1
" i 'm sitting here as an elder statesman , and i 'm watching this happen , and i do n't believe it			0
" @entity105 , a business owner in @entity106 , @entity107 , shares @entity87 ' concern			0
@entity109 is the owner of @entity111 , which provides janitors to businesses around the country			0
the family - owned company has been under fire from the @entity30 , which argues that @entity111 intimidates , harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize			1
it has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years			1
@entity105 said the claims are unfounded , and it 's the union that has harassed him			2
he said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company , staged noisy protests , confronted employees , blocked building entrances and even released balloons in a client 's building to disrupt business			1
but he told @entity1 his workers do n't want a union because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay @entity30 's labor dues			2
" we have several hundred people working for us in @entity106 [ alone ] , " @entity105 said			0
" they 've been after us for almost three years , and they 've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said			0
if our people really needed protecting , do n't you think they 'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting @entity111 ? do you think we 'd still be in business ? i do n't think so			2
" but union workers @entity1 talked to say workers at @entity111 are afraid to speak out because they might get fired , as @entity157 said she was			2
" we 're not the only ones , " @entity157 said			0
" there are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same " kinds of things			0
and that , says @entity29 , is why the @entity13 is so critical			1
the @entity30 president claims the legislation merely provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union			1
" this is workers ' choice , " @entity29 said in february			0
" they can have a secret ballot , or they can legally affirm by a majority of them signing cards			2
" observers believe @entity29 's union has the muscle to push the legislation through the @entity183 controlled @entity10			2
the @entity30 was the largest contributor to @entity22 campaigns this election , pumping $ 85 million into campaigns and get - out - the - vote drives			2
the union said 2,000 members temporarily gave up their jobs to work for @entity20 's election			2
now " we have a friend in the @entity195 , " @entity29 declared monday			0
" thank @entity196 for @entity20			0
" @entity1 's @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
