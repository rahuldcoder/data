-- @entity1 wants to make sure you do n't miss the most important updates , photos , humblebrags and baby announcements from your friends			2
the company on tuesday announced a tweak to its news feed that will take a popular story -- one that 's getting lots of comments and likes -- and put it back at the top of your feed to make sure you do n't miss it			1
on a typical day , the average @entity1 user is only seeing 20 % of the posts from friends and pages that he or she follows			1
where are the rest ? filtered out by @entity1 , using algorithms it has developed to determine the stories and posts the social network thinks you 'll care about most			1
now @entity1 has decided to shed some light on the mysterious decisions that go into ranking the stories in the news feed			2
people have grumbled in the past about not having a pure , kitchen - sink feed of all their friends ' updates , so the company is explaining a little about how it does what it does			0
to figure out what posts to show , @entity1 looks at a person 's most recent everyday actions such as liking , sharing or hiding posts , the amount of interaction they have with people or pages , and a post 's popularity among their group of friends			1
@entity1 displayed updates differently in the past			0
the social media site was once a chronologically ordered feed of all the things posted by friends and pages			0
but then its number of users soared -- now more than 1 billion -- and over time , most users collected so many connections that their bloated feeds became unwieldy			0
on an average day , @entity1 says you have about 1,500 posts from friends and pages you follow			1
but only about 300 of those appear in your feed			0
@entity1 thinks showing all 1,500 stories would be overwhelming , and that people would miss important posts in that flood of updates			1
the company did some tests and found that people read , comment and like fewer posts when faced with the entire unfiltered stream			0
even with the shorter , ranked news feeds , people only read an average of 57 % of the posts			0
with the new tweak , older posts can resurface and the amount of stories read jumps to 70 % , @entity1 said			1
it also resulted in a 5 % increase in likes , comments and shares on the resurrected posts from friends , and 8 % increase in the same activity for posts from pages , it said			2
" the data suggests that this update does a better job of showing people the stories they want to see , even if they missed them the first time , " @entity1 said in a blog post			1
for a price , you can ensure that your posts are among the chosen stories in your friends ' streams			0
in an attempt to profit from the system , @entity1 launched a feature last year that lets people pay to promote their own posts			2
the price varies depending on your location and how many people will see the post , but it ensures your link or update wo n't get buried by an algorithm .			0
