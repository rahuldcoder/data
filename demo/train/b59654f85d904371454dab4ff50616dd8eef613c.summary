@entity0 -- after much anticipation , and against the wishes of the international community , @entity2 finally pushed the button on its third underground nuclear test , this time using more sophisticated technology than its previous attempts			1
while it marks another milestone in the short , but increasingly eventful , reign of young leader @entity14 , it also threatens to undermine an already fragile security situation in the region			0
how worried should we be about @entity2 's nuclear test ? it 's worrying but does this mean they can drop a nuclear weapon on @entity23 ? absolutely not			1
the notion that they are going to target the @entity26 is way off the mark			2
any time the @entity2 stage a test , it significantly improves their nuclear capabilities			1
this comes after they staged a rocket launch that was successful , a long range rocket which appears to have put a satellite into orbit			0
what they need to achieve to have the weapon they want is the capability to miniaturize a warhead and put it on a rocket			0
this test is n't going to do that in and of itself , but it is a significant step forward			1
what will happen next ? the @entity48 will meet			0
@entity49 is the chair this month so they get to call the agenda			0
there will be discussion about a much tougher sanctions resolution			1
the $ 64,000 question is whether the @entity58 will in the end agree to anything significant enough for it to really affect @entity2			1
i think it 's certain , whatever the @entity48 does , the @entity26 will move on its own to ratchet up sanctions			1
i also think the @entity26 will beef up their military presence in the region			1
it will mean stronger anti-missile defenses going to @entity49 and possibly @entity67 why is @entity58 's reaction so important ? the @entity58 do n't like the idea of international sanctions and coercing other countries			1
they still have a strategic interest in maintaining a viable separate @entity2 as a buffer against a pro- @entity26 @entity49 and that has only become more important as tensions between the @entity26 and @entity58 have increased			1
are you worried about @entity2 's tests ? share your views with @entity1 on the other hand , a nuclear @entity2 that is behaving in an adventuristic way risks very bad outcomes from the @entity58 point of view			1
what @entity58 least wants is a more active , antagonistic , robust @entity26 military presence in @entity86 in conjunction with the strengthening of military capabilities of allies who are not @entity58 's friends			1
@entity58 companies are more involved in @entity2 than they were half a dozen years ago , so the @entity58 stand to lose on that front if the @entity26 tightens sanctions			1
who really calls the shots in @entity2 ? ( @entity2 leader ) @entity14 has people around him but he 's driving the show			2
there 's no evidence to suggest that he 's not in charge			0
all the personnel changes he made he was able to make without enough pushback for it to matter			0
he 's got military people around him , and his uncle			0
i do n't see any evidence to see that he 's not ultimately in charge			0
how significant is the timing of the test ? it 's the birthday of @entity118 ( @entity14 's late father ) on ( saturday )			2
assuming this ( test ) is not a total dud , this will be ... great propaganda and they will play it to the hilt			2
they may be hungry , they may be miserable but by @entity129 they 've got a bomb and they can stand up to the rest of the world and that really , really matters in @entity2			2
you also have a power transitions in @entity136 , @entity137 ( and the @entity26 )			1
how can @entity138 not devote more attention to @entity2 in his @entity141 address ? everyone is reacting to them and that 's how they ( @entity2 ) like it			2
what do n't we know ? we do n't know yet whether this was a test of a plutonium device or a uranium device			0
the previous two tests were plutonium			0
we know they have a uranium enrichment capability			0
we know that a uranium bomb , once they master it , is easier to make and they have deposits of uranium in @entity2 so they can keep digging it up			0
if they have successfully detonated a uranium bomb and they have moved forward in the process of developing the technical capabilities to miniaturize it and put it on a war head , then in purely military terms it 's worrying the test also raises interesting questions on the proliferation front			2
the more successful they are with this program , the scarier the consequences should they choose , for example , to provide @entity180 with test data or fissile material or other information .			0

test a " step forward " in @entity2 's nuclear *ambitions* , says @entity185
@entity26 likely to push for tougher sanctions , he says
@entity58 's reaction to nuclear test will be *key*
