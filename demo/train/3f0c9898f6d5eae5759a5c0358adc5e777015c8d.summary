-- there 's a great dive bar in my neighborhood called @entity5 's where they oven - bake the chicken wings			1
and they 're absolutely amazing			1
i 'm not saying i 've had semi-inappropriate fantasies about them			1
but i 'm also not denying it			2
things continue to be weird at home			2
but it 's worth noting that , despite my undying love for these wings , i 'm actually a complete coward when it comes to sauce			1
spicy foods have never really been my thing			2
unlike some of my friends who , in a pinch , would happily use @entity25 for contact lens solution			2
so , i could only sit in horror as i read a trending story from @entity29 this week about the first person to finish the " world 's hottest curry			1
" and , sadly , we can only assume this brave hero also sat in horror several hours later when he realized that the world 's hottest curry wanted out			1
" strong men ... also cry			2
" nevertheless , dr. @entity38 proudly became the first of more than 300 people to conquer @entity42 's famous dish , " @entity43			1
" a name that , apparently , had a slightly more menacing ring to it than " the @entity47			2
" @entity51 , in the @entity29 @entity49 town of @entity50 , has been serving the @entity52 since 2010			2
the recipe , which is openly shared online , has become a popular web search as curry enthusiasts around the world clamor for new and interesting ways to make one of the most delicious and wonderful foods on the planet completely inedible			1
specifically , the main driving force behind the @entity52 's heat is 20 @entity64 chilis , which were developed by a @entity50 man named @entity66 who grew the record - breaking strain completely by accident			1
@entity42 's managing director and executive chef , @entity71 , took those accidental chilis , combined them with other peppers and extracts , and created what he believes is the world 's hottest curry			1
i 'll never know because i still value the functioning ability of my esophagus			2
it 's where pudding goes			1
amazingly , just cooking the storied dish requires gloves , goggles and a gas mask			2
which , generally speaking , is a sure sign that whatever you 're doing in the kitchen is less safe than , say , heating up a @entity91			2
cooking meth is less safe than heating up a @entity91			0
and so , hundreds of people have tried to finish off the @entity52			0
but up until just the other day , nobody had ever made it to the end			0
and only a few have lasted past four or five mouthfuls , most opting instead to vomit , cry and rethink their overall purpose in life			0
" i should buy a boat			0
" though @entity38 amazingly finished the entire dish in just over an hour , it was n't easy			1
in fact , it was probably downright reckless			0
armed only with a bottle of beer , he bravely made it halfway through the meal before excusing himself for a short walk			0
not so much because it was a particularly nice day but because he actually began hallucinating			0
about 10 minutes later , his wife found him wandering up @entity115 , presumably having a rather nefarious conversation with own hand			0
we shall light stuff on fire			0
" eventually , with tears running from his eyes , @entity38 downed the very last bite of the world 's hottest curry			1
or so the restaurant still claims			0
it 's all rather unofficial			1
however , what is official is the actual hottest chili pepper			1
according to @entity131 , that honor was most recently set in march 2011 by the @entity133 " @entity135 " pepper from @entity134			0
i googled this thing , and it looks pretty damn mean			0
if ever there was a fruit capable of having sex with your sister and kicking your dog , it 's the @entity133			1
the previously mentioned @entity64 chili -- used in the @entity52 -- earned the highly coveted record a year earlier in march 2010 but was ousted only a few months later by the @entity149 chili , also grown in the @entity150			1
they remain third and second , respectively			0
so , that 's the story of the man who conquered the world 's hottest curry			1
surely , everybody knows someone right now who would gladly accept the challenge			0
and they would all likely fail			0
for it takes a true warrior to step up and face the @entity52			0
or you can just be sensible and have something else			0
strong men ... also eat teriyaki .			0
