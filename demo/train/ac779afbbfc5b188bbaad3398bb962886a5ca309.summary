@entity0 marked her 41st birthday this week in very different circumstances from previous years			1
the @entity4 veterinarian from @entity5 spent the day in a prison in the small @entity8 nation of @entity9			1
she 's being held there in connection with a drug investigation in which she says she was unwittingly caught up			2
" it 's been a nightmare , " her mother , @entity14 , told @entity15 on wednesday			1
" we just want her to be able to come home			2
" @entity21 shares a cell with two other women and has received treatment for an abscess at the prison clinic , her mother said			1
" never in a million years would i have thought that she 'd be spending her birthday today in a prison , " @entity14 said with tears in her eyes			2
' she had no involvement ' the way that @entity21 , who has been traveling solo since january 2013 , ended up in jail is a terrifying case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time , according to her and her mother			1
after working for 10 years as a vet and saving money , @entity21 quit her job , sold her home and belongings and set out to travel the world , setting aside a small nest egg for when she would eventually come home , @entity14 said			1
on september 5 , @entity21 was sharing a cab from near the @entity48 border to @entity49 , the capital of @entity9 , when the journey turned into a traveler 's nightmare			1
on the way , another passenger asked to stop and pick up a package at a @entity57 office			2
" my daughter was in the vehicle in the backseat , " @entity14 said			0
" she was looking up in her @entity62 to find a hostel , he came back with a package			2
at that point , the police surrounded the car and arrested all three of them			2
" the package was found to contain methamphetamine , @entity21 said on her @entity72 page			1
police searched her and her belongings and gave her a urine test , which she said came back clean			0
" at that initial point she was n't that worried ; she knew she had no involvement , " @entity14 said			0
' very scared about the future ' but @entity21 was held for four nights in a detention center before being conditionally released by a judge			2
" the person who picked up the package , he told the police and he testified before the judge that he did n't know my daughter , " @entity14 said			1
" he had never met her before ; he did n't know the driver			0
he had just paid to hire the driver			0
" but the terms of @entity21 's release prevented her from leaving @entity9 while the investigation into the case continued			1
she found herself caught up in the young developing country 's justice system and was advised to hire a lawyer			0
" i am under a lot of stress and very scared about the future , but i am trying to stay strong , " she said in a @entity72 post on september 24			0
her situation appeared to be looking up last week , when she had a court appearance to retrieve her passport			0
but rather than giving @entity21 her papers and letting her go , the court detained her again and sent her to @entity109 prison outside @entity49 , a @entity104 official said			1
" she had thought this was being resolved -- now this , " said her mother , who has set up a @entity72 page titled @entity114			0
' a violation of human rights ' @entity117 , a senior lawyer representing @entity21 , said the court had detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest -- although the reason for the warrant remains unclear			1
he said her arrest , in which she was deprived of the rights to a defense and to be heard before a judge , had n't followed due process			0
" we consider this to be a violation of human rights , " @entity128 said , but he warned that under @entity9 's criminal procedure law , an individual can be held in detention for up to a year while there is an ongoing investigation			0
the @entity138 did n't respond to calls from @entity15 seeking comment on @entity21 's case thursday			1
the @entity4 government is seeking " a fair and expeditious resolution to this case in accordance with @entity9 law , " the @entity104 official said			0
hair cut short for her first five days in @entity109 prison , @entity21 was held on her own , according to @entity14			1
her long blond hair was cut short to comply with prison protocol			0
but she 's since been moved to a unit with about 16 other women , at least one of whom has a child , @entity14 said			0
she is being treated as well as can be expected and gets three meals a day , her mother said			2
the @entity4 @entity161 is in " close contact " with @entity21 and a consular official visited her in prison on tuesday , the @entity104 official said			1
@entity14 said embassy staff have been " extremely supportive " in the case -- they brought @entity21 a birthday cake recently			1
she said she hopes a meeting friday between @entity104 officials and the @entity9 ambassador might help move the case forward			0
the staff of sen. @entity177 of @entity5 have been " working with the @entity104 and her family to get this resolved as quickly as possible , " said @entity172 , a spokesman for the senator			0
@entity5 sen. @entity179 's office is also working with the family , he said .			0

@entity0 was detained by police in september during a taxi journey
she says another passenger in the cab picked up a package containing drugs
@entity21 spent her birthday this week in a prison where she is being treated for an abscess
" it 's been a nightmare . we just want her to be able to come home , " her mother tells @entity15
