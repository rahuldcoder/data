@entity0 -- @entity2 reiterated its opposition wednesday to the publication of air pollution readings in @entity2 cities by foreign embassies and dismissed suggestions that it release similar figures for @entity12 cities			1
" foreign embassies and consulates in @entity2 do n't have the legal authority to monitor @entity2 's environment or release relevant data , nor do they have the professional capabilities or conditions to do so , " said @entity13 , a @entity14 spokesman , at a daily press briefing			1
" we hope relevant foreign embassies and consulates will comply with universally recognized international conventions as well as @entity2 laws and stop such irresponsible actions			2
" @entity29 spokesman @entity28 said tuesday that the @entity12 @entity30 and consulates in @entity2 provide air pollution information to the @entity12 community so that " it can use to make better daily decisions regarding the safety of outdoor activities			1
" @entity28 insisted that @entity12 diplomatic missions in @entity2 would continue releasing the readings , denying @entity2 allegations that the @entity12 action has violated the @entity41 , a set of international treaties that govern diplomatic relations			1
he added that @entity45 would have no objection if the @entity2 @entity30 decides to publish air pollution index for @entity12 cities			1
but @entity13 brushed that notion aside			0
" we are not interested , " he said			0
vice minister of environmental protection @entity51 said tuesday that , by monitoring @entity2 's air pollution and releasing relevant data , foreign embassies have violated the @entity56 and the @entity57 , as well as environmental protection laws and regulations of @entity2			1
although @entity51 did not mention specific embassies , the statements have been generally interpreted to be directed at the @entity12 diplomatic missions , which maintain popular @entity63 feeds providing hourly readings for the cities of @entity0 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
the @entity12 @entity30 website refers to them as an " unofficial resource for the health of the @entity73 community			0
" the @entity12 readings are widely viewed as a reliable alternative to the official index maintained by @entity2 's @entity77			2
derived from a monitoring station in each of the embassy grounds , they typically paint a starker portrait of air quality than official reports , often falling within " unhealthy " bands , as defined by a rating system developed by the @entity12 @entity86			1
for example , at 11 a.m. wednesday , the @entity12 embassy reading for @entity0 reported a pm 2.5 concentration of 191 micrograms per cubic metre ( µg / m³ ) for an @entity92 value of 241 , a " very unhealthy " score			0
in contrast , the environmental bureau reported 134 µg / m³ for a " slightly polluted " aqi of 142			0
the @entity86 system measures air pollution by a pm 2.5 standard , which means particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter ( less than 1/7 the average width of a human hair )			2
according to the @entity86 , the " fine " particulate matter is believed to pose the greatest health risk because it can lodge deeply in human lungs			0
@entity2 has traditionally monitored pollution at a less - rigorous pm 10 standard , which refers to larger particulates of 10 micrometers or less in diameter , which accumulate in the respiratory system when inhaled			2
@entity51 said that it is " obviously inappropriate " to be applying foreign standards to the local landscape and that readings determined from a single monitoring station are unscientific			0
but under pressure to improve its notoriously poor air quality , @entity2 began releasing pm 2.5 data for @entity0 in january			2
according to @entity120 , @entity51 said that 74 major cities had been told to raise their monitoring standards to @entity123 by the end of october and release data by the end of the year			0
these rent moves build upon revised air quality policies that require an index of @entity123 be implemented nationwide by january 1 , 2016 .			0

new : @entity14 says embassies lack legal authority to monitor environment
@entity2 has told foreign embassies to stop publishing their own air pollution readings
the directive is understood to be directed at the @entity12 diplomatic missions
@entity143 @entity12 readings *adhere* to more rigorous @entity86 standard to measure air quality
