@entity0 -- @entity2 is poised to become the world 's largest economy within a decade , according to some economists			1
rising giant @entity6 already has a middle - class population that is larger than the entire @entity9 population , according to others			1
such nuggets fuel an industry of prophetic warnings of decline , exemplified by the phrase " how @entity16 in the world it invented " in the subtitle of @entity19 and @entity21 's recent best - seller			0
the rapid growth of @entity2 and @entity6 and other @entity24 tigers does not mean that the @entity9 has " fallen behind , " however			1
it takes a panicked perspective to even ponder the point			0
@entity2 and @entity6 have immense economies , each with state - of - the - art technological centers that put others to shame			1
but they are also ranked 125th and 162nd , respectively , in gdp per capita ( according to the @entity36 's @entity35 ) , lacking clean water and safe food for too many citizens			0
both face massive environmental and infrastructural challenges within the next decade			1
neither country is in range of providing an @entity9 level of services to its citizenry , much less the comfortable level typical of flourishing northern @entity50 economies			1
and if we consider the deeper cultural dimensions of globalization and innovation , one could go so far as to argue that the globalization game is and will remain rigged in @entity9 's favor , with other nations not being able or even willing to catch up			1
in truth , many societies in @entity59 and @entity60 are confronting ambivalence and resistance to developments that we might see as progress but that their traditionalists see as moral and social decline			1
@entity69 and @entity70 are just two examples of nations whose rapid modernization was undercut by underlying reactionary cultural forces			2
for related reasons , the various proud @entity24 tigers are not on an unbendable trajectory			0
current trends are not destiny ; it is more accurate to say that culture is destiny			0
@entity85 academics may deride the " unoriginal " thinking of @entity2 or @entity6 students , but this critique is based on an entirely different ( some would say culturally imperialistic ) worldview			1
@entity101 's " @entity100 , " still proudly full of wisdom today , stands as a reminder that disruption , individualism and innovation are inherently heretical in many traditional societies -- and if they occur in one area of a traditional society , a backlash typically follows in another			0
@entity107 's spirit , with its vigorous opposition to consumer capitalism , is hardly extinct			0
meanwhile , @entity9 is the best at being @entity9 , because @entity9 is the closest thing to a society that unambivalently enjoys being @entity9			1
the @entity9 has cultural and demographic traits that remain unique -- for better and worse			1
@entity9 culture is peculiarly tilted toward valuing disruptive new ideas and welcoming the immigrant who brings such ideas into its society			2
an individualistic , heterogeneous , novelty - seeking @entity9 culture , strengthened by a critical mass of interdisciplinary @entity9 research universities that draw the world 's best minds , represents a considerable edge in social and economic innovation			2
for today 's emerging economies to become long - term giants , rather than variations of prerevolution @entity69 and the @entity129 , they must become more economically and socially integrated			0
and to become economically integrated , they must become culturally integrated , which means a host of conflicts are on the horizon regarding varying societal views on change , tradition , materialism , social mobility , openness , patronage and so on			0
it will not be easy , and success is not inevitable			0
many emerging nations are like a young child on the precipice of a tense and unpredictable adolescence			0
eastern nations may in time become better than the @entity149 at the freewheeling socioeconomics that @entity9 and the rest of the @entity149 invented , but not without considerable social turmoil			2
a true taste for innovation and adaptation will result only from a vigorous clash between individualistic impulses and communitarian ones -- clashes that will take decades to play out , with uncertain outcomes			0
americans may block their own path and sabotage their own cultural tilt toward innovative growth if political dysfunction continues			1
but with even some sensible reform of the political system , a resilient , forward - thinking and forward - moving economy should result			0
@entity9 was the key force in popping open the @entity170 box of commercial and cultural globalization , with all the attendant anxieties and unintended consequences			2
but the globalization game is an inherently @entity9 game , and it will take a great deal of luck , strategy and determination for someone else to play the game better than @entity9 are able to play it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

the rapid growth of @entity2 and @entity6 does not mean the @entity9 has fallen behind , @entity185 says
both face major environmental and infrastructural challenges within the next decade , he says
many @entity59 and @entity60 societies are facing resistance to progress , @entity185 says
@entity185 : @entity9 may sabotage its tilt toward innovative growth if political dysfunction continues
