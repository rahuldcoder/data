-- @entity1 never expected his photos of dogs to make a big splash , but then again , he never expected one of his canine clients to jump into a pool during a shoot			1
@entity1 , 31 , is the photographer behind a quirky collection of images of dogs caught in the act of diving , swimming , splashing and generally goofing off in the water			1
what makes the photos different from anything you 've seen before is @entity1 's perspective : below the surface , with the dogs lunging toward the camera in pursuit of a toy			1
dogs are an interesting subject , he says			1
" they enjoy the benefits of 21st century living , staying in a warm house , sleeping in the bed with you , " he says , " but getting in the water brings out the wildness in them			2
" @entity1 's soggy dogs shot to stardom on february 9 , when someone posted a few of his pictures on the social sharing site @entity44 and they became an overnight viral hit , spreading to @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 and in short order reaching 150 million views			1
his website ( www.littlefriendsphoto.com ) crashed under the weight of a huge increase in traffic			2
" by the morning of february 10 the pictures were everywhere , " he said			2
" it just went nuts			2
it literally happened in the blink of an eye			2
" suddenly he was receiving requests and offers from all over the world			2
one of those offers was a book deal from @entity66 , which on october 23 published " @entity67 , " a 132 - page coffee - table book ( $ 19.99 ) dripping with drenched dogs			1
a 2013 wall calendar also is on sale			2
" i would have never known something like this could happen , " @entity1 said			1
" i went from not having enough work to having too much work			2
" @entity1 said he wants to show the unique personality of each dog he photographs and tell its story			1
" i 'm interested in how emotional they are and how similar to humans they are , " he said			0
before the shooting starts , @entity1 spends time getting to know the dog and earning its trust			1
" i show up , we start playing fetch , we become pals and we just move it to the water , " he said			0
@entity1 wears a wet suit and snorkel mask , and sometimes uses diving weights to keep himself from floating			1
then he tosses a toy and starts shooting			0
cooling off in the dog days of summer he never knows what he 's going to get			0
sometimes it takes two hours in the water to get a good shot , as it did with a pug named @entity101			0
on the other hand , @entity103 , the wide - eyed black @entity104 on the cover of the book , gave him that stellar image within three minutes , he said			0
" i could have a great shot immediately -- or not , " @entity1 said			1
" but that 's what i love about it			0
" some of the photos are downright frightening or otherworldly as the rambunctious animals bare their teeth and flail their paws in pursuit of an elusive tennis ball or other toy			1
" you might get something silly or you might get something terrifying , " the photographer said			1
" some kids think those really kind of primal , edgy shots are funny			0
" the way @entity1 got into dog photography is a story in itself			1
" for me , it 's been like destiny if you believe in that sort of thing , " he said			0
while working in advertising at @entity135 , he started volunteering at a @entity137 - area animal shelter			0
@entity1 shot flattering portraits of animals awaiting adoption , a departure from the usual shelter photos of terrified animals in small , dark cages			1
nicer pictures , ones that brought out the animals ' personalities , resulted in more adoptions , he said			1
" we 've gotten fantastic results from showing positive photographs , " he said			0
soon after , he and a stranger cooperated to corral a stray weimaraner that was running around on a busy road			0
after the dog was safely out of traffic , the men chatted , @entity1 mentioned his shelter photos and the stranger hired @entity1 to take pictures of his dog			1
referrals led to similar gigs			0
it was at one of those private shoots that a dog first jumped into a pool , and a new career was born			0
( the @entity171 recently hired @entity1 to go to @entity172 to shoot the sockeye salmon migration			1
a major difference between photographing dogs and photographing fish , he joked , is that " the salmon certainly are n't interested in a tennis ball			2
" ) his work at the shelter also led @entity1 to create a nonprofit organization called @entity183 , through which he trains shelters in the art of pet photography			1
that work has taken him all over the @entity189 as well as to @entity190 and @entity191 , he said			0
" i really enjoy it because it gives me freedom to explore what i 'm passionate about			0
" " i do n't even call it a job			0
it 's my life , " he added			0
" it 's kind of a dream - come - true thing for me			0
" how do you think your pooch would fare in an underwater shoot ? share your thoughts in the comments section below			2
