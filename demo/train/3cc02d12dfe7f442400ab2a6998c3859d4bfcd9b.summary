-- @entity1 is a football backwater			0
a country where the domestic league is plagued by corruption and the huge population is largely indifferent towards the " beautiful game			0
" the sport in the nation has been rocked by a bribery investigation which resulted in two former high - ranking officials being handed 10 - and - a - half - year prison sentences , while four former national team players are serving shorter terms			1
so why would @entity15 , a soccer star who recently scored the penalty which crowned @entity18 champions of @entity19 , swap the bright lights of the @entity21 for mid-table mediocrity with @entity23 ? it seems strange , but the @entity26 striker is the latest in a line of high - profile football figures to take advantage of the attractive salaries on offer in the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
he will reportedly be paid $ 315,000 a week -- the highest in the @entity32			1
@entity15 seals big - money @entity34 move " all these players going over there are past their prime and looking for one last big payday which will see them through for the rest of their lives , " football agent @entity35 told @entity0			1
" it 's definitely money motivated			2
" it 's the commercial side of it			2
that 's what @entity1 clubs pitch to the players and their agents			1
it 's not the standard of football they are used to , but the money they can make on the commercial side is absolutely immense			2
" @entity15 's former @entity18 teammate @entity59 made the switch in january , joining @entity23 on a two - year deal			1
@entity64 's @entity63 - winning coach @entity62 was recently appointed at @entity65 , an ambitious club which has splashed out on @entity67 players @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity71 's @entity70			1
where @entity34 and @entity73 are concerned , the recruitment drive is being funded by wealthy individuals who , according to @entity76 , professor of sport business strategy at @entity78 's @entity77 , see football as a way to gain political influence			1
@entity73 is owned by @entity82 , chairman of the @entity83 , while @entity34 's chairman @entity84 heads online gaming company @entity85			1
" essentially they are vanity projects , " @entity76 told @entity0			0
the idea behind bringing top - level players to the @entity32 is , he believes , related to an attitude which is prevalent within the @entity1 national psyche			1
" there is a @entity1 phenomenon known as ' guanxi , ' which translates literally as ' special relationship , ' " explained @entity76			0
" buying a club gives an owner good ' guanxi , ' because it enables you to connect with politicians and other business people			0
very often owners buy into clubs for those reasons			0
" if @entity1 football is successful globally , it makes @entity1 look good and it makes the politicians look good			0
what buying a club does is give the owners a certain amount of political influence			0
" despite luring stars such as @entity15 and @entity59 away from @entity19 's finest competitions , the @entity32 is yet to truly capture the public 's imagination			1
this is partly down to the reputation the sport has among @entity1 's 1.3 billion inhabitants			2
a recent crackdown on corruption saw @entity119 and @entity120 , two former directors of the @entity122 , sent to prison for over a decade after being found guilty of accepting bribes			0
former national team midfielder @entity125 , who played for @entity1 39 times between 1995 and 2002 , was sentenced to six years behind bars , while former teammates @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 will spend five and a half years in jail			0
" there are a lot of allegations of bribery , match - fixing , corruption , " said @entity76			2
" in terms of the general public , it is largely switched off to @entity1 football , because they are aware many of the people involved in the game are not straight			0
" not only do fans not want to watch football which is fixed , at the same time parents do n't want their kids associated with something which has got such a poor record and high profile in terms of corruption			0
" there are far superior products out there , such as @entity157 's @entity156 , the @entity21 and @entity64 's @entity158 the likes of @entity160 and @entity161 think of @entity1 and big money , but the reality is football is a minority sport in @entity1			1
" while investment attracts players with global reputations , it does little to aid the development of young @entity1 talent , meaning little or no benefit is felt by the national team -- which is 73rd in the @entity173 world rankings			2
with @entity1 struggling to establish itself as a true football power , @entity76 said the money being spent on foreign players could instead be redirected to develop an infrastructure which would help develop promising youngsters			2
" if you look at @entity68 , he stands out from the crowd because he is so superior			1
the standard of his play is so superior compared to the local players , " @entity76 said			2
" @entity1 football clubs are investing very little in grassroots			0
investment and spending is heavily skewed towards the professional level and not towards the development of the game			0
" the current trend is for aging stars such as the 34 - year - old @entity15 and @entity59 , 33 , to head to lesser leagues such as the @entity32 in the twilight of their careers			1
@entity35 sees no reason why the migration can not continue , and he expects others to follow that path -- @entity202 striker @entity201 , 29 , is the latest player linked with a @entity1 switch after almost a decade spent playing in @entity78			1
" ( @entity1 clubs ) seem to be doing it the right way at the moment , " @entity35 said			0
" the stadiums are getting built , they 're recruiting big names			0
" they 're not going gung ho , they 're not going over the top and there are still some local players there			2
another couple of big - name players will go over , perhaps in the next couple of months			1
" but , according to @entity76 , the modern @entity1 population are not excited by over-the - hill players , and he said only a genuine football superstar will successfully engage the public			1
" the @entity1 are an interesting group of people because on one hand they 're quite defensive about themselves , " he said			0
" but at the same time they 're becoming more aware of their own identity			0
" they 're not prepared to accept @entity19 's castoffs			2
they do n't want @entity59 and @entity15			1
they want @entity70 and @entity68 , and then the likes of @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			1
" players who are in their early to mid- 20s and reaching the peak , it would be those people who would be much more significant			0
then the floodgates will open			0
