-- and that 's not such a good thing			2
today 's kids are less fit than their parents were at the same age , according to new research presented at the @entity8 's @entity7 , and that could mean health problems later on			1
the fact that younger kids are huffing and puffing more than their parents did at their age does n't just mean they are n't in shape			1
it 's also a red flag that they may more vulnerable to certain chronic diseases as adults			1
researchers from the @entity21 's @entity20 analyzed and compared 50 studies on children 's running fitness between the years 1964 and 2010			0
the studies included about 25 million kids between the ages 9 and 17 in 28 different countries			2
the researchers recorded running times over a specific time frame -- typically about five to 15 minutes -- or over a certain distance -- a half mile to two miles			0
they found that over the 46 years , the cardiovascular endurance -- measured by the times it took to run the various distances -- among kids declined significantly			2
from 1970 to 2000 , @entity40 children 's cardiovascular endurance fell about 6 % per decade , and among all countries , it fell about 5 % each decade			0
in other words , today , kids are 15 % less fit than their parents were , and in the mile run , kids are about a minute and a half slower than children were 30 years ago			1
@entity48 : study : more active teens get higher test scores the researchers say that cardiovascular fitness is one of the most important factors for good health , not just in childhood but in adulthood as well			0
" if a young person is generally unfit now , then they are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease later in life , " said lead study author @entity59 in a statement			0
currently , the @entity65 recommends that children get at least an hour of daily activity that involves the entire body , such as running , biking or swimming			1
not only does the exercise benefit the body , but research shows that kids who are more physically active tend to do better in school too			1
