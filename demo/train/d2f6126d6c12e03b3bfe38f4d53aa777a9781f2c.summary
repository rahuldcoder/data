-- one can hardly read the news these days without learning that yet another @entity4 corporation has announced plans to invert , which is corporate - speak for restructuring as a foreign company to avoid @entity4 taxes			1
it 's a trend that has increased exponentially over the past decade with barely a peep from @entity12			0
now that corporate giants such as @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have made bids to invert by merging with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid @entity4 taxes , @entity12 may finally act			1
these large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters , but they really wo n't change the way they do business			0
@entity16 , for example , is buying an @entity26 - based company			0
if the merger goes through , the company has said it will maintain " operational headquarters " in @entity30 , where the company is currently based			0
in other words , not much will change except the company will claim to be foreign			0
( @entity16 officials say the move is not about avoiding taxes and that the firm will still face substantial taxes ; the firm does have the right to cancel the deal if @entity12 changes the law in a way that removes the tax benefits of inversion			1
) @entity15 , the nation 's largest drug retailer , has said it is considering moving its headquarters to @entity48			0
inversions are just another ploy that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their @entity4 tax bills			1
according to the @entity55 , legislation to limit corporate inversions could provide an additional $ 19.5 billion in revenue over 10 years			2
even among corporations that are n't pursing inversions , shifting profits offshore to avoid @entity4 taxes is a huge problem			1
for example , @entity4 corporations reported to the @entity64 that subsidiaries in @entity66 and the @entity67 collectively earned profits equal to 16 times the gross domestic product of those countries , according to recent data			1
it 's clearly impossible for companies to earn profits in a country that are exponentially larger than that country 's entire economy , further proving companies are using accounting gimmicks to avoid @entity4 taxes			2
@entity4 corporations engage in these tricks because they can defer paying @entity4 taxes on alleged offshore earnings until they officially bring those profits to the @entity4 , which may never happen			1
corporations get a permanent break when they invert because the @entity4 will not tax profits earned outside its borders			1
corporate inversions are often followed by earnings stripping , a maneuver that artificially shifts profits into lower - tax or zero - tax countries			1
a recent @entity94 © explains how the highly profitable manufacturer @entity95 suddenly began reporting @entity4 losses or very small profits each year after inverting to become a @entity66 corporation in 2001			0
this did not reflect any actual loss of @entity4 customers or business			0
rather , the corporation accomplished this by loaning $ 3 billion to its @entity4 subsidiary , which then deducted the interest payments on the debt to effectively wipe out its @entity4 income for tax purposes			2
defenders of corporate inversions often argue the @entity4 ' 35 % statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage , but most @entity4 companies pay nowhere near that rate			1
defenders also claim profits earned in the @entity4 will always be taxed here			0
but the earnings stripping practiced by @entity95 and other inverted companies suggests this is not true			0
the ultimate goal of much multinational tax planning is making profits appear to be earned in countries with a zero or low tax rate			0
reducing the nation 's corporate tax rate can not address the fact that many corporations are employing various means to avoid @entity4 taxes altogether			1
companies that have recently sought inversions continue to benefit vastly from public investments			0
the drugs and devices made by @entity14 and @entity16 , which are often sold by @entity15 , would have far fewer buyers if not for @entity140 , @entity141 and other federal health programs			0
they would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible			0
taxpayers should be outraged that these companies have no qualms about benefiting immensely from the @entity4 economic system without contributing their fair share			2
but @entity12 can easily fix this by moving forward with a @entity156 proposal to bar corporations that are obviously @entity4 from pretending to be foreign			1
the plan would sensibly treat newly merged companies as @entity4 if they are majority owned by shareholders of the original @entity4 company , or if they are managed and controlled inside the @entity4 and have substantial business here			2
there 's much more to be done to reform @entity4 's tax code , but we ca n't afford to wait for lawmakers to settle how to approach that challenge			2
if @entity12 waits too long , there wo n't be much of a corporate tax left to reform .			1

@entity4 corporations merge with foreign companies , move their headquarters
@entity177 : such " inversions " enable firms to *greatly* lower their @entity4 corporate tax bill
he says *government* can lose billions of tax revenue from such maneuvers
@entity177 : @entity12 should pass *administration* proposal to bar inversions
