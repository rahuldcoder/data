-- " @entity2 " star @entity1 is leading the way again			0
the openly gay @entity1 , who played @entity4 on the @entity6 series " @entity2 , " is one of the actors credited with helping change perceptions about gay people via that hit show			1
this fall he is coming back to his former network as the star of " @entity11 " in which he will play a gay single dad of a teen daughter			0
but @entity1 will not be among as big a crowd of gay leading characters on broadcast television as he would have been had his show premiered last year			1
photos : coming out in @entity22 last fall tv season a plethora of shows burst onto the small screen with leading gay characters in everything from comedies to musical dramas			1
many of those series have since been canceled			2
gone are shows like " @entity34 , " " @entity35 , " " partners " " @entity37 --- - in @entity38 23 , " " smash , " " @entity40 , " and " @entity41			0
" and it seems to be a bit of irony that while same - sex marriage support has been gaining ground , this year 's fall tv season feels -- at least on the surface -- much less inclusive			2
" for a lot of people , even still today , the only @entity50 people they actually know are on their screens -- on television or in film , " said @entity55 , an actor and spokesperson for @entity57			1
" so it 's a real opportunity for people to meet @entity50 people in the comfort of their homes or the darkness of a theater to have an emotional experience and really understand the lives of @entity50 people			1
" that means that a possible wedding between the characters of @entity73 and @entity74 on @entity76 's " @entity75 " in the wake of the @entity78 striking down the @entity79 this summer could have an affect on those who may be still on the fence about same - sex marriage			0

" it is important that our stories get out there and tv is one of the best ways to do that			0
" when @entity6 's comedy " @entity34 " premiered last fall , it was heralded by the lgbt community for its plot about a gay male couple trying to have a baby			0
@entity105 , the @entity106 's tv critic , noted that while that show did n't catch on with fans , @entity108 chairman @entity107 said at the @entity112 summer press tour that he did n't believe the gay characters on the show turned away viewers			1
rather , as @entity108 president @entity117 pointed out , audiences are less patient these days in terms of giving a struggling series time to catch on			0
" the takeaway for all of this is that in 2013 , there can be a " @entity34 " and it can fail , despite brilliant writing and performances , and there can be a ' @entity11 , ' which may fail or catch hold , " @entity105 wrote			0
@entity85 said there are some bright spots in the upcoming broadcast tv season , including returning @entity50 characters on shows like " @entity132 , " the aforementioned " @entity75 " and " @entity133			1
" he said there is greater racial diversity among @entity50 characters this year , including @entity136 as half of an interracial lesbian couple on @entity139 ' " @entity140 " and @entity141 portraying a gay police captain on @entity144 's new cop comedy " @entity147 " starring " @entity145 " alum @entity146			1
" there will also be an increase in the role for @entity151 on ' glee ' where he plays the transgendered student ' @entity154 ' which we 're very excited about as ' @entity154 ' will become the only trans regular on television , if you do n't count @entity159 , " @entity85 said			0
@entity57 recently put out the @entity160 , which found that , with the exception of a handful of movies like " @entity164 " and " @entity165 , " most big films lack any significant @entity50 presence			1
@entity57 also produces a report , " where we are on tv , " which @entity55 said acts as a resource for networks			2
he said the trend this season will be diversity and @entity57 would like to see even more of that as well as a greater variety of gay roles in various genres such as sci - fi			1
@entity85 said that is why his organization eagerly awaits @entity76 's new series " @entity185 , " which will feature a gay character			2
he said diversity of characters goes beyond race and gender and means having gay characters of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds			2
" our community is as diverse as any other , " @entity85 said			0
" telling all of those stories is really important			0
it 's important that we be seen as not just a group of gay , white men			0

several of the broadcast series featuring gay lead characters have been canceled
@entity57 spokesman said that for some , the only @entity50 people they know are on screen
this season there will be diversity among gay tv characters
