@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 visited the headquarters of @entity6 last month , he had one question for its founder : is it possible for @entity10 to be the number one online encyclopedia in @entity1 ? do n't call me @entity4 : @entity14 , head of @entity6 , the largest @entity1 encyclopedia website			1
" absolutely not , " was the response of @entity14 , head of @entity6 , the world 's largest @entity1 encyclopedia website			1
" because there is @entity6 here in @entity1			2
of course we are a copycat of @entity10 but we have a lot of innovations , and we do a lot of work here in @entity1 so it is totally different actually , " @entity14 told @entity2			1
it 's been a year since @entity1 's government lifted its ban on the @entity1 version of @entity33 - based @entity10 yet it remains unclear whether @entity10 has gained any share of the country 's massive internet readership			1
shortly after @entity10 was launched in @entity1 in 2002 , the country 's internet censors began to intermittently block access to both @entity1 and @entity41 versions of the online encyclopedia with the longest ban lasting around three years			1
in recent months , @entity44 has held a series of meetings with officials from the @entity48 , the government body charged with internet censorship in @entity1 , to establish a dialogue between the @entity10 community and @entity1 government			1
he says they have not discussed why the website was banned			0
" we have a friendly relationship , " @entity44 told @entity2			0
" but in terms of getting down to the nitty gritty of what happened , i have no idea			0
it is not really a big concern			0
" what is a big concern for @entity44 is whether @entity10 can compete with the country 's two homegrown encyclopedia websites that emerged while @entity10 was blocked : @entity6 and @entity68 , an online knowledge sharing site launched by @entity68 , the no. 1 search engine in @entity1			1
one challenge @entity10 faces is it lacks the brand recognition in @entity1 that is otherwise nearly universal			1
" i had an @entity41 - speaking , college - educated tour guide [ in @entity0 ] , and he asked me what i do ? " @entity44 told @entity2			0
" i said , ' i am the founder of @entity10			2
' he had a blank stare			0
he had no idea what @entity10 was			2
this would not happen anywhere else in the world			0
everyone knows @entity10 if they are using the internet			2
" @entity44 said he is trying to mobilize the local @entity1 @entity10 community to spread more awareness about the online encyclopedia but otherwise has not outlined a specific strategy to beat its more entrenched domestic competitors			1
" i think i am going to have to come to @entity1 a lot and do interviews so people can learn about @entity10 , " said @entity44			1
" once people come to understand it that will be helpful for our cause			0
" ' no reason for @entity1 to use @entity10 ' yet @entity44 ' star power alone may not be enough to convert @entity1 's 300 million internet users into @entity102 , or volunteers who run the website			1
" there 's , in fact , no reason for @entity1 to use @entity10 , a service based ' out there , ' " @entity68 's chief scientist @entity105 said at a 2008 internet conference in @entity0			1
" it 's very natural for @entity1 to make its own products			2
" and it is also very natural for @entity1 to use domestic encyclopedia websites that some say are better suited to the online habits and informational demands of the country 's exploding population of internet surfers			1
" we know the market better , " said @entity14 , founder of @entity6			2
" that is why we can get a bigger share of it			0
" @entity6 has more than 3 million articles and 1.7 million registered users , according to its website			0
@entity68 has nearly 2 million entries ; @entity131 has just 280,000 and over 700 thousand members			1
@entity133 has more than 3 million articles and over 10 million volunteers			0
" we have the largest team here who are more familiar with the wiki concept and wiki operations in @entity1 , " @entity14 told @entity2			1
" of course we are more focused on the wiki community , which means we need to get a lot of people involved to make it grow			0
" @entity6 utilizes a range of social networking functions to attract @entity1 internet users , including chat forums , fan groups , short messaging services and bulletin boards			2
nearly 100 million @entity1 netizens regularly visit online bulletin boards , according to research from @entity156			1
the website rewards members through a ranking system where users are upgraded to a higher status on the site based on the points they earn			0
members also can win prizes , like laptops and @entity168 , for high participation on the site			0
@entity68 has a similar model			0
@entity10 uses a reputation system to promote its members based on their participation on the website and the quality of the content they contribute			2
promotion is subject to peer approval , and the site 's volunteer administrators are elected by the community			0
" the entry barrier is really high on @entity10 for @entity1 users , " said @entity14			1
" we do n't have a very hierarchical structure to say who is managing this or who is managing that			0
" instead both @entity6 and @entity68 have a centralized management structure			0
paid staff are charged with mobilizing the community to contribute to certain topics as well as filter out content that might offend the @entity1 government			1
saying ' no ' to censorship @entity44 has refused to comply with @entity1 censorship rules , which means certain pages containing sensitive information on both @entity41 and @entity1 @entity10 remain inaccessible			1
" the question is how comfortable is @entity1 about just describing the facts ? " said @entity44			2
" in some cases that is not completely clear , so right now there are certain pages that are filtered from @entity10			2
we do n't support that but we also ca n't do anything about it			0
but it is far better than just blocking the entire site			0
far better for @entity1 and for us			2
" since @entity6 's and @entity68 's business operations are based in @entity1 , the companies have little choice but to comply with government policy or face the same fate as @entity10			1
" if there is something that the government does n't want , we do n't talk about it , " said @entity14			1
" we just follow the law			0
" which is why in the long run many @entity1 @entity102 say their website will win			2
" i do n't think they can become a reference book like @entity10 because they do n't have a serious community focusing on improving the quality of content as well as trying to respect neutral point of view , " said @entity223 , a @entity1 wikipedian and blogger			1
" they have to follow the hidden rules and you never know what those are			0
" however @entity14 said @entity6 's content , in time , will improve if the @entity1 government continues to gradually loosen its grip on the internet			1
" i have been seeing a lot of improvement , " said @entity14			2
" so we should be glad for that , of course			0
" @entity44 also said @entity10 's reemergence in @entity1 , albeit at times unreliable , is a sign that @entity0 's web policy is changing			1
" we are hopeful , " said @entity44			0
" @entity10 has been open for more than a year , and we are hoping that will continue			0
we would like for @entity10 to have as much impact in @entity1 as it has in other places around the world			1
" @entity14 's does n't believe it will happen			1
" there is no way , " said @entity14			0
" i do n't want to be the @entity4 of @entity1			1
i just want to say that we want to do something good for society			0
that is our dream actually			0

home - grown online encyclopedias much more popular than @entity10 in @entity1
@entity4 has refused to tailor @entity131 to censorship laws
incentives like ipods and laptops for @entity1 netizens who add / *vet* entries
" we do n't talk about what the government does n't like , " says @entity14
