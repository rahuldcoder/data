-- " when a man is tired of @entity3 , he is tired of life , " memorably proclaimed @entity5			1
whereupon that man -- presumably -- is buried in @entity3			1
lucky him ( or her )			2
the city has some of the best , most atmospheric , cemeteries in the world			2
luminaries from @entity12 ( @entity13 ) to the suffragette @entity15 ( @entity16 ) to @entity5 himself ( @entity18 , which is really not your everyday resting place ) are buried here			2
being famous , though , does n't guarantee an interesting gravestone			1
some of the best tombs belong to the largely forgotten , people who nonetheless seemed to have had big plans for the hereafter			1
@entity26 : the big sleep @entity28 is the most famous of @entity3 's great @entity30 cemeteries , bursting with big names and bombastic memorials			1
yet in choosing her favorite gravestone , @entity34 , author of " @entity36 -- @entity3 and its dead , " picks someone removed from the worlds of literature and the arts , with which @entity28 is normally associated			1
@entity26 ' tomb , guarded by his " immortal dog ... faithful to the last [ is ] a great example of @entity30 animal memorial art , " she says			2
@entity26 was a bare - knuckle boxer , whose final fight is considered to have been in effect the first boxing world championship			2
it ended in chaos , but won him an army of fans			2
an estimated 100,000 people turned up to his funeral in 1865 , with his dog , @entity57 , as chief mourner			2
@entity13 , @entity59 , @entity28			2
tours monday - friday , 1:45 p.m. , saturday and sunday , 11 a.m. -4 p.m ; Â £ 12.00 adults , Â £ 6 children ; +44 208 340 1834 @entity63 : colossus of tombstones @entity66 is among the most formal of great @entity3 cemeteries , but it still has tombs wacky enough to get the deads ' net curtains twitching -- or so you imagine			1
the flamboyant @entity30 circus owner @entity63 -- the so - called " @entity73 " -- could n't decide which classical theme he wanted on the family tomb , so he went for them all			2
@entity78 sphinxes jostle with @entity80 capitals and @entity82 tablets lean against @entity84 angels in what @entity34 describes as a " suitably @entity87 monument to a larger than life showman			0
" the @entity90 magazine merely calls it " ponderous coxcombery			0
" @entity66 , @entity93 , @entity66 ; +44 208 969 0152 @entity94 and @entity95 : six feet above the immaculate graveyard of @entity97 in the @entity3 neighborhood of @entity99 , a former hamlet , has its fair share of carved skulls and weathered inscriptions to once - cherished octogenarians -- and one very odd memorial			1
the legend holds that @entity107 and his wife , @entity108 , inherited some money , but the bequest would end when they were buried			0
the obvious solution was to stick their coffin in an enormous stone wedge , making it practically impossible to bury -- and also quite difficult to look at			1
it was erected in 1809 by their son , @entity117 , later an influential voice in the cemetery - preservation movement			0
@entity121 , @entity122 , @entity99 , @entity123 sir @entity124 : @entity125 forever sir @entity124 is best known for his saucy translations of " @entity127 " and for publishing " the @entity125 " in @entity128			1
although his wife , @entity130 , a devout @entity131 , claimed to be mortified by his interests , she appeared to celebrate them on his death by erecting a mausoleum in the shape of an @entity138 tent in the incongruous surroundings of a suburban churchyard			0
throughout the rest of her life , @entity130 would take afternoon tea and hold the odd @entity144 inside the tomb before joining her husband in there on her own demise			0
nosy visitors can peer through a window in the roof at two dusty coffins surrounded by lanterns , camel bells and murals of the night sky			0
@entity157 , 61 @entity158 , @entity159 ; + 44 208 876 1326 @entity160 : guarded by @entity3 's loveliest lion many @entity3 cemeteries have a lion -- animals of all stripes are well represented in its graveyards -- but perhaps the most elegant has since 1912 slept in the jungle that is overgrown @entity169 in @entity170			1
the beautiful stone - carved creature commemorates menagerist @entity160 , who traveled the world with big cats , occasionally branching out to camels and hyenas			0
" people stroke the @entity169 lion 's left paw for luck -- the marble is bright and shiny as a result , " says @entity34			0
@entity183 , @entity184 , @entity170 ; +44 207 275 7557 @entity185 : the tree of death acclaimed author @entity185 's first job , in the 1860s , was at @entity190 , where he helped to exhume thousands of skeletons from the cemetery in the way of the new @entity195 line			1
the bones were reburied , but @entity185 was left with the gravestones			0
he got rid of some by stacking them around a young ash tree			0
whether or not he meant the solution to be permanent , roots and stone are today completely fused			0
the ancient churchyard , once a haunt of grave robbers , is now one of the most peaceful places in busy @entity190			0
@entity190 , @entity208 , @entity3 @entity209 : the spinster 's ' time machine ' " it looks like @entity218 's @entity219 as designed by the architects of the @entity221 , " says author and publisher @entity212 , who 's been investigating time machine claims about the mysterious last resting place of three @entity30 spinsters			1
like so many 19th - century @entity223 tombs , this one in @entity16 is @entity78 in style			1
what distinguishes it are the strange hieroglyphic carvings and a twisted monogram on the door			0
built in 1852 for unmarried @entity209 and her daughters , no plans for the tomb have been found and it 's the only monument in @entity16 for which no key can be found			0
the time machine story supposedly dates to a mischievous 1998 press release			0
@entity16 , @entity237 ; +44 207 352 1201 @entity238 : bare bones you could n't find a stronger or more stylish contrast to the dominant grandiose tendency in gravestone design than the plain monument to the bestselling comic sci - fi author @entity238			1
located in the newer , eastern part of @entity13 , the tomb belonging to the author of " @entity248 " has merely his name , the year of his death ( 2001 ) and a description : " writer			1
" @entity13 details above .			0

the best tombs in @entity3 belong to the famous and lesser known alike
*explorer* @entity124 rests in *extravagant* digs
one coffin hangs permanently in the air
author @entity238 wastes few words on his headstone
