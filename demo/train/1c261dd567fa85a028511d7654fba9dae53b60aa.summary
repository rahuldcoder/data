@entity0 , @entity1 -- two of @entity5 's sons , who had been reported captured over the weekend , were free early tuesday as forces loyal to the embattled @entity1 leader battled rebels trying to consolidate their hold on @entity0			1
@entity10 showed up at the @entity11 , one of the remaining strongholds of @entity15 forces , in a convoy of armored @entity17			1
in a brief interview with @entity2 's @entity19 , he said his father and several of his sisters were safe in @entity0 , and that loyal troops had " broken the back " of the rebels who moved into the capital over the weekend			1

another of those siblings , @entity33 , was reported to have escaped monday , according to the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity35			1
there was no immediate explanation from the @entity38 , the rebel leadership that had announced their capture sunday			2
the younger @entity5 said news of his arrest had been a trick by the rebels , and that he had been traveling around @entity0 in his armored convoy the entire time			1
he said that government forces had lured the rebels into a trap in the capital , and that @entity5 loyalists " have broken the spines of those rats and those gangsters			1
" @entity55 , the @entity27 's chief prosecutor , had said sunday that he would seek @entity10 's extradition following his capture			1
asked about the warrant for his arrest , @entity10 told reporters , " to hell with the @entity27			1
" the rebels had most of @entity0 under their control late monday , but pitched battles continued at various points around the city and @entity5 's whereabouts remained unknown			1
gun battles in the area around the longtime @entity1 strongman 's former @entity70 compound echoed until after nightfall monday			0
" the real moment of victory is when @entity5 is captured , " @entity38 chairman @entity73 told reporters in @entity75			1
@entity5 has held power in @entity1 since a september 1969 coup			2
the rebellion against him began in february and has been aided by @entity82 airstrikes that began in march , under a @entity84 mandate to protect civilians			0
the revolt gained momentum rapidly in the past two weeks , with rebel forces launching their push on @entity0 over the weekend			2
in a statement to reporters from his vacation on the @entity95 resort island of @entity96 , @entity35 president @entity90 said that while situation remained fluid , it was clear that " @entity5 's rule is over			1
" " the pursuit of human dignity is stronger than any dictator , " he said			0
on sunday , @entity5 took to the airwaves several times urging citizens , including women , to fight the rebels -- whom he called " very small groups of people who are collaborators with the imperialists			2
" " get out and lead , lead , lead the people to paradise , " he said			0
under @entity5 , @entity1 lived " as slaves , " a 23 - year - old @entity0 woman , who agreed to be identified only as @entity115 , told @entity2 's " @entity116 360			1
" though @entity5 is the only @entity1 leader she has ever known , his ouster " will be the best thing that ever happened to me , " @entity115 said			2
" i will thank @entity121 for every moment i will live without him , without his control and without his sons ' control as well , " she said			0
if the @entity5 regime falls , it would follow revolutions in @entity129 and @entity130 this year in what is known as the @entity132			2
a spate of other countries in the region -- including @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 -- have also seen protests by citizens demanding more freedom and a change in regime			0
in many cases , these demonstrations have been met with brute force			0
but @entity15 forces were still fighting into the early hours of tuesday			0
tracer fire , anti-aircraft guns and artillery could be seen and heard around @entity151 , about 30 miles west of the capital , which was a strategic steppingstone for the rebel advance into @entity0 over the weekend			2
@entity82 warplanes flew overhead at times , and ambulances raced through the town after the fighting erupted			0
@entity5 's forces also fired at least three missiles at the rebel - held city of @entity165 , east of @entity0 , on monday evening , the @entity82 alliance reported			1
@entity82 said it had no reports of damage or injuries , but called the launches a " direct threat to innocent people			0
" " although the surface - to - surface missiles in @entity5 's arsenal are highly inaccurate , and are not designed to hit a specific target , they are a weapon of terror , " @entity82 said			1
" their use against an urban or industrial area is utterly irresponsible			0
" at least one missile was a @entity183 - era @entity182 , launched from near @entity5 's hometown of @entity185 , said a @entity35 military official who spoke on condition of anonymity monday evening			1
@entity82 forces destroyed another of the missiles on the ground over the weekend , and another of the short - to medium - range missiles was fired at rebel forces last week but exploded harmlessly in the desert , a senior @entity82 official said			0
@entity35 and @entity82 officials said they were concerned forces loyal to @entity5 might stage a last - ditch attack against civilians			2
senior levels of @entity82 were watching closely for any sign of a massing of @entity1 government forces or the movement of weapons such as rockets or artillery , said a senior allied official , speaking on condition of anonymity because of sensitive intelligence matters			0
former @entity35 diplomat @entity212 told @entity2 that it was " imperative " that @entity5 be found quickly and the fighting brought to an end			1
" the danger here is that this insurgency could continue , the fighting could continue , as long as @entity5 believes he 's still in power , " @entity212 said			1
the rebels on monday also arrested @entity220 , an anchor from @entity1 's state - run television			0
@entity220 had brandished a gun on air over the weekend and said that staffers at the television station were prepared to become martyrs			0
" with this weapon , i either kill or die today , " she said sunday			0
rebels said they found her in her car near a coffee shop monday , and pandemonium ensued when word got out that @entity220 had been arrested			0
witnesses said @entity220 was unharmed but would not be speaking to reporters			0
a cordon of soldiers quickly formed to isolate her from media representatives , other rebels and gawkers			0
@entity2 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 and journalist @entity251 contributed to this report .			2
