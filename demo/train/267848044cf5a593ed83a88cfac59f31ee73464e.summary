-- @entity1 began to introduce the next host of the " @entity3 , " @entity4 , by having current host @entity5 interview him and take a selfie together on tuesday night			1
@entity5 called @entity4 " always entertaining , " " the new kid " and " my friend			1
" what @entity5 was saying , implicitly , was that he supported @entity1 's pick for his successor			0
@entity1 announced that it had signed @entity4 to a multiyear deal back on april 10 , one week after @entity5 revealed that he intends to retire in 2015			1
the unspecified timing of the transition came up during the chat between the two comedians			0
when @entity5 asked about family matters , @entity4 , who has three kids , said , " they 're getting ready for me to hang around too much			1
" he pointed out that he 'll be signing off his @entity22 show " @entity23 " at the end of the year , " and then there 's -- i do n't know -- when are you leaving ? i should have asked ! , " @entity4 said as @entity5 laughed			1
" i should have asked			0
" " the thing is , " @entity4 said , getting back to his family , " they get nervous , they get nervous			0
i think they like me , but they get nervous when i 'm around too much			0
" @entity4 appeared as himself , not as his " @entity23 " character			1
tuesday 's " @entity3 " visit is likely to be the first of many media appearances that introduce the " real @entity4 " to viewers			1
@entity4 also styled himself differently than he usually does on the " @entity23 , " further distinguishing between that show and his next late - night act			0
instead of glasses with invisible frames , he wore hipster frames , for instance			0
" you look good , " @entity5 said as @entity4 came on stage			1
" you look right at home			0
" @entity4 showered praise on @entity5 , and remarked at one point , " i 'm gon na do whatever you have done			2
" when @entity5 responded with mock disapproval , he added , " it seems to have gone pretty well , @entity5 ! " " it 's , it 's gone on , " @entity5 said			0
during the two - segment interview , @entity4 talked about how he applied to be an intern on the " @entity3 " in 1986 and submitted a writing sample for a job in 1997			2
" i was unemployed at a professional level , " @entity4 quipped			0
by the time he heard back from the " @entity3 , " though , the show that became " @entity59 " -- which @entity4 co-created and starred in -- was in the works			1
true to " @entity3 " form , @entity4 read what he said was his actual writing sample from 1997 : a " @entity64 " titled " @entity64 cocktails for @entity66 , " with inventions like " @entity68 you out , " " @entity71 " and " @entity69			2
" when the " @entity64 " animation played on screen , @entity5 joked , " wait a minute ! he does n't get that yet ! " opinion : @entity4 is taking a big risk what is @entity4 like out of character ?			2
