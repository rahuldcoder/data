my daughter graduated from @entity2 to traditional @entity3 when she was 5 , around the time the iconic building blocks maker released its @entity6 line based on five female characters			1
my daughter was interested in science and art , but @entity3 was interested in selling her pink beauty salons and cupcake bakeries			1
when we went @entity3 shopping , she expressed frustration over the lack of female " minifigures " in her favorite @entity3 , such as the blue - and black - packaged @entity18 set or the yellow - boxed @entity20 world			1
@entity3 has expanded the @entity6 line by introducing activities such as biking , camping and playing sports			2
but now at 7 , my daughter is very much aware of the gender disparity in toy marketing			0
she sees it in the color - coded toy aisles , where male characters outnumber females , and she 's frustrated that she does not see more female characters in toys she likes			1
the friends line encapsulates my problem with @entity3 : the lack of female minifigures in the yellow , blue and black boxes and the lack of males in the @entity6 sets			1
it 's obvious from walking through a toy store that @entity3 has focused its licensing and product development around boys			1
to capture the girl market , @entity3 created the alternate , girl - only world of @entity51 for friends instead of incorporating more females into existing @entity3 sets			2
@entity3 says the line was one of its most successful to date , " surpassing early projections to triple the number of girls building with @entity3 bricks " in 2012			2
but that still leaves the market wide open for children such as my daughter , who want more female " minifigs " in gender - neutral packaging			0
instead , @entity3 clearly distinguishes which sets are aimed at boys or girls , and our children take in the colors on the packaging and placement on the shelves through a cultural lens			1
they get the message loud and clear			0
@entity3 is the second - largest toy manufacturer in the world ; gender parity matters in a product that is consumed and loved by so many children			2
when kids play across gender lines through my business and blog , i frequently discuss gender stereotypes in children 's products			0
a few weeks ago , a dad in @entity92 pointed out the @entity94 competition site , which allows @entity3 enthusiasts to submit product ideas on which the community may vote			2
the father asked me to use my social media following to promote a project called the " @entity101 , " comprising 13 ideas for female minifigures engaged in astronomy , chemistry , geology , zoology , firefighting and law enforcement			1
i loved the project 's focus on women in science , technology , engineering and mathematics			2
these are examples i want for my daughter and son			0
if my daughter sees females in these roles , she is more likely to believe that she can fill these roles as an adult			0
if my son grows up with females occupying an equal amount of space in his toys , he is more likely to become an adult who respects women and sees them as equals			0
@entity136 says pink easy - bake oven discourages boys from playing kitchen research shows that when women make up 25 % or more of a group , stereotypes begin to drop off , according to gender activist group @entity143			2
about 16 % of @entity3 minifigures are female , and this number includes the friends line , according to @entity143 analysis			1
the project reached 10,000 votes on june 13 , thanks in large part to social media			0
@entity3 said the project will advance to the review phase , where a @entity3 review board will examine the idea			0
during the campaign to get 10,000 votes , i noticed how many times people commented they would buy these sets because their sons and daughters wanted them			0
i drafted a @entity164 petition to aggregate these consumer voices and let @entity3 executives know that if they make the @entity101 , we will buy it in droves			1
the petition asks @entity3 's decision - makers to consider the voices of more than 9,000 petition signers who say they would buy female @entity173 for our sons and daughters			1
while gender equality in toys is largely seen as a girl - power issue , dozens of comments on the petition indicate that parents understand it 's important for boys and girls to see female characters doing smart and daring things			1
i think @entity3 is a wonderful toy with a few not wonderful parts			0
@entity3 gives my son and daughter a chance to play side by side			0
and in the end , that is what i am after , a space that is equal for boys and girls .			0

@entity199 *launched* a petition asking @entity3 to make proposed @entity101
@entity101 includes 13 female characters in law enforcement , science roles
@entity199 says it 's good for girls and boys to see female figures in smart and daring roles
