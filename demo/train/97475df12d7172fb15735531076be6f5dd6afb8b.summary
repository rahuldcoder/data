-- would the @entity1 extradite @entity2 to @entity3 , where an @entity3 court found her guilty thursday of murdering @entity6 @entity5 ? @entity1 officials may never have to decide , a legal expert said saturday			1
" i think we have a hint from @entity3 that they may not seek her extradition , " @entity10 professor @entity9 told @entity0 " new day saturday			1
" " look , they let her go back to the @entity1 , even though the case was then pending , knowing that it would be very difficult to get her back in @entity3 , so the @entity3 government may be satisfied with convicting her and then letting her spend the rest of her life in the @entity1 -- not able to travel to @entity25 or to @entity3 , so it may resolve itself that way			1
" still , if the conviction is upheld on appeal , if there are no clear violations of due process and if no new compelling evidence is submitted , the case should be treated routinely , @entity9 said			0
in other words , @entity35 should be treated an ordinary person , the @entity10 law professor added			1
and if an extradition request is made , the @entity1 would likely comply , according to @entity9			2
" the @entity3 legal system , though i do n't love it , is a legitimate legal system and we have a treaty with @entity3 so i do n't see how we would resist , " he told @entity40			1
citing privacy and confidentiality concerns , @entity45 spokeswoman @entity44 declined to say whether @entity3 has requested that @entity35 be extradited			1
@entity35 and her former boyfriend , @entity3 @entity48 , were found guilty thursday of the 2007 murder of @entity50			1
prosecutors say @entity50 was held down and stabbed after she rejected attempts by @entity35 , @entity48 and another man , @entity54 - born @entity5 , to involve her in a sex game			1
@entity56 is in jail for the killing			0
in the conviction , which reversed an earlier appeal judgment , @entity48 was sentenced to 25 years in prison ; @entity35 , who is a student at the @entity62 and did not attend the trial , was sentenced in absentia to 28 - 1/2 years			1
@entity35 lawyer @entity65 told @entity0 on friday that his client has received " an incredible outpouring " of support , and that the evidence against his client was non-existent			1
" there is absolutely no evidence today , there was no evidence before and there never will be any evidence of her guilt , " he said			0
asked whether he believes the @entity1 government would honor an extradition request from @entity3 , if one were issued , @entity65 noted that at least one appeal and other legal issues remain before that would be an issue			1
" it 's really not a question that is an issue today or tomorrow or for a long time to come , " he said			0
" it 's really not right for consideration , and i would n't comment on that at this time			0
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity89 agreed that there is a long road ahead for @entity35			2
" more time for her hair to grow out , " said @entity89 , who also appeared on " new day saturday			0
" " she is sporting a new hairdo , i do n't know if you noticed that yesterday , in what i think is a public relations effort to sort of humanize @entity2 and keep that high public opinion poll that out there for her			0
" that public opinion has been shaped by largely positive media coverage of the case in the @entity1 , according to @entity9			0
one example of apparent media sympathy , if not support , is a photograph published saturday in the @entity107 showing @entity109 anchor @entity108 holding the hand of the 26 - year - old convicted murderer			0
" we wish you the best , going forward , " @entity108 told @entity35 at the end of a teary interview			2
" i do n't know why public opinion is so supportive of her innocence , " said @entity9 , who described the circumstantial case against @entity35 as compelling , though not overwhelming			2
" this is not a case , as it 's been projected in the media , of no evidence at all			0
it 's a case of the kind that would have resulted probably in a conviction in most courts in @entity1			0
and so yet , because she is attractive , and because she has created a media campaign all over the country , she 's become very popular			0
and i do n't think we should do justice by popularity or justice by the way a person looks			0
this is a case for extradition			0
" the victim , he said , has largely been ignored by the @entity1 media , which has been supportive of @entity35			2
" in @entity3 , it 's exactly the opposite			2
in @entity3 , she 's @entity145 , she 's the worst murderer in history			2
" @entity50 's brother , @entity147 , told reporters on friday that he expected @entity3 would file an extradition request if the @entity150 upholds thursday 's ruling by the lower court			1
" in as much as , yes , if somebody 's found guilty -- and this would go for anybody -- if somebody 's found guilty and convicted of a murder			1
" he added , " i do n't see why they would n't			0
" @entity9 told @entity0 last march that , if an extradition request is made and @entity35 somehow avoids being sent back , " she remains a prisoner in the @entity1 , because @entity161 will put a warrant out for her and , if she travels anywhere outside the @entity1 , she 'll be immediately arrested and turned over to @entity3			1

" i think we have a hint from @entity3 that they may not seek her extradition , " law prof says
