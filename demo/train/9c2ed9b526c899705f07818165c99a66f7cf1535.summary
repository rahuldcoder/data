-- i ca n't prove it , but i think @entity3 might have thirty - four hours in each of her days			1
how else could she possibly fit it all in ? today , for instance , the @entity6 - born actress , 36 , is in the car on her way to the airport			1
she 's flying to @entity11 to promote " @entity12 , " which will wrap in may after eight crazy - successful seasons			1
and what 'll she do the first morning after filming ends ? " sleep ! " she laughs			1
after call times at 5:30 a.m. , she says , " i have n't had sleep in eight years			1
in addition to her day job , @entity3 moonlights at many passions : she runs @entity23 , the nonprofit she founded , inspired by her developmentally disabled sister			1
she also co-owns @entity26 restaurants in @entity27 and @entity28 , wrote the best - selling cookbook @entity29 , executive produced " @entity32 " ( a documentary about child migrant farm laborers ) , and is getting her master 's degree in political science and chicano studies			1
before she zips across the country , @entity3 talks food , the day she walked over hot coals , and the positive phrase that helped her get through her divorce			1
q : how do you define a healthy life ? people think health only has to do with your physical being , but for me , it 's so much more			1
i remember after my divorce , i was so thin and everyone kept saying how great i looked and it was probably the most unhealthy place i 've ever been			1
so it was funny what people would see as " healthy			1
" in my worst time , people were saying i 've never looked better			1
[ but now ] i have a great diet and exercise routine			1
and i try to have a healthy outlook			1
i 'm your everlasting , hopeless optimist ! @entity0 : the biggest celebrity health stories of 2011 q : where does your positive attitude come from ? i was just born with that			1
it 's so funny , because i do n't get depressed			1
even after my divorce , everybody was like , " wow , you bounced back so quick			2
" i was like , " i am not letting this take over			2
something great is around the corner -- i ca n't wait to see what 's going to happen			2
" q : you mentioned eating well and exercising			2
what 's your go - to ? i love to cook			1
but when i 'm on set , i have food delivery sent there			1
before i could afford a food delivery system , i would make my breakfast and lunch , i 'd pack some snacks , and put almonds in my purse			1
i was always prepared because i was always hungry			2
it 's funny , i would be like , " @entity89 anyone ? " and they 'd say , " what is in your purse ? " q : so it looks like you 're eating grub from the bottom of your purse			1
just the raw almonds , i soak them in water overnight			2
it makes them plump , and they pop in your mouth			2
i learned that from a @entity108 seminar			2
fifteen years ago , i went and after that i became a vegan			2
for , like , a year , because i was just like , " @entity112 , he 's scared me into never eating meat again ! " [ @entity114 ] it did n't last though			2
@entity0 : mouthwatering meatless meals q : did the @entity108 seminar change anything else for you ? no , it just confirmed everything that i was already doing			2
you know , " take charge of your life ! " i am			2
that 's why i 'm here ! i did walk the coals			2
i walked over the fire			2
i love self - help , anything that 's going to move you forward in life			1
the second i saw ' @entity133 , ' i was going , " oh , i live my life this way			2
so i 'm doing good			0
" q : do you like to exercise ? my bachelor 's degree is in kinesiology , so it 's ingrained in me to work out			0
i was an aerobics instructor , and a personal trainer in college , so i was addicted to exercise			0
i used to do an hour and a half to two hours a day			0
i 'd teach a class and then train clients			1
and i realized i did n't need that much			0
now i like weight training and abs. i love abs. i hate the elliptical			1
[ @entity114 ] i despise cardio			0
i just ... ca n't do it			0
so i try to do my cardio within the workout			0
q : what 's your big health regret ? well , i think the time that i became a vegan			0
[ @entity114 ] i love the philosophy behind veganism , but i went from one day eating chicken and meat to eating just salad			1
i did n't know how to be a vegan			0
i did n't know about soy or almond butter			0
i did n't know that there are great breads			0
so i literally stuck to salads			0
and i think i passed out the first week			0
@entity0 : celebrities who embraced natural medicine q : what do you like to cook ? i love chicken leg quarters and asparagus			1
my most requested thing to cook for friends is @entity183 tortilla soup and guacamole and chili - rubbed skirt steak			0
q : do you have any beauty secrets you learned growing up ? after i shower , i put baby oil all over my body			1
and then you dry that off so you have the smoothest , softest skin			0
q : i feel like you 've been on every " most beautiful " list there is			0
oh , @entity197 no. i was talking to @entity198 [ @entity199 ] about this the other day			0
i said , " you 're the most beautiful thing in the world , " and she said , " no , you are			0
" and i said , " no , i used to be			0
" [ @entity114 ] i was like , " no , honey , i 'm old news			0
" q : do you feel pressure to keep up with the whole " beautiful " thing ? no. i think that 's probably why i make those lists , because it takes a village to build me for the red carpet			0
it 's an illusion created by stylists , hair , makeup			0
i do n't put as much effort into it as my team does			1
but i think people see something beyond that with me , and i love that i 'm defined by my charity work			1
i think that 's what people see when they give me this label of " she 's a beautiful person			0
" q : you 're so busy			0
what 's the most relaxing thing you do all day ? i love to get in bed and turn on @entity235			1
i save five in a row and fall asleep to him ranting about something			0
it takes me out of my element			0
q : finish this sentence : " in 2012 , i 'm going to _ _ _ _ _ a whole lot more			0
wherever the wind takes me			0
i could live anywhere ; i can learn any language			0
i love being immersed in the world			1

" before i could afford a food delivery system , i 'd pack some snacks , " @entity3 says
" now i like weight training and abs. i love abs. i hate the elliptical , " she says
@entity3 : " after i shower , i put baby oil all over my body "
