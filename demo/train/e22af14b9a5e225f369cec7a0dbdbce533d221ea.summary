-- when the new @entity2 says it 's 100 % fully charged , it may actually not be -- at least that 's been the word on the web the past few days			1
this has caused concern among @entity2 users hoping to get the most out of their device 's battery life , and the normally tight - lipped @entity11 has responded in order to clarify the issue			1
here 's what 's going on : when the @entity2 is plugged in and reaches a full charge , it actually releases a small percentage of the charge , then charges back up , repeating this process until you unplug it			2
once the @entity2 says it has reached " 100 % , " you are guaranteed at least 10 hours of battery life , which is what @entity11 promises of the tablet			1
this , according to @entity11 vp of product marketing @entity26 , is done so that devices can maintain optimum charge			2
" that circuitry is designed so you can keep your device plugged in as long as you would like , " @entity26 told @entity31			0
" it 's a great feature that 's always been in @entity35			0
" @entity11 did not immediately respond to our request for further comment			0
@entity40 's @entity39 first noticed the issue in his testing of the new @entity2 , and published his findings online			0
" if the new @entity2 is fully charged overnight , then my tests show it will run 11.6 hours , which is 1.2 hours longer than if it just charged to 100 % , " @entity39 wrote in an email			1
whatever is going on inside the battery , there is no need for alarm -- nobody 's actually having serious battery issues , like what happened when @entity35 and the @entity53 debuted			0
you should get at least 10 hours of battery life out of your @entity2 if it 's the @entity56 - only model , and 9 hours of life if it 's @entity58			1
