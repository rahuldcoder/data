ask any mom or dad to name one of the biggest challenges about parenting today , and you will probably get an earful about the constant judgment they face about their decisions			1
breast vs. bottle , stay - at - home vs. work outside the home , natural birth vs. drug - assisted delivery , baby carrier vs. stroller			2
it 's not just what you decide but the disapproval you face from the opposing camp			2
trust me , i 've been there			2
it is truly ridiculous when you think about it , which is exactly the point of a hilarious and moving new ad by formula maker @entity31			1
the commercial , which has now been seen more than 4 million times on @entity34 , pits the rival camps against each other on ( where else ? ) the playground			1
there are the stroller moms , the moms with baby carriers , the working moms , the stay - at - home moms , the stay - at - home dads and of course the " breast is best " crowd pitted against the bottle - feeders			1
the breast police have arrived , " says one of the moms holding a bottle			0
straight from the source , " a breastfeeder fires back			0
if only these kinds of exchanges were simply the creation of comedy writers , but sadly , they 're not			0
moms , stop all the judgment ! neither is a verbal volley like this one in the ad : " i wonder what it 's like being a part - time mom , " says a stay - at - home mom			1
a working mom tartly responds , " i wonder what they do all day			0
" another mom in a suit answers , " @entity74			0
" and , just when all these moms and dads get ready to literally rumble in the sandbox , moving closer and closer to each other , a stroller with a baby inside goes flying downhill after her mom lets go of the handle			1
as the moms and dads start realizing what happened , they all chase after the stroller until finally the stroller is caught and the delicious baby inside is saved			1
that leads to smiles , hugs and handshakes all around , and this line on the screen : " no matter what our beliefs , we are parents first			1
@entity98 , director of marketing for @entity99 , the maker of @entity31 , said the ad is a direct response to what she and her colleagues have heard from parents			1
it 's not about ( bottle ) - feeding vs. breastfeeding			0
it 's bigger than that			0
it is from the type of diapers you choose , whether it 's disposable or cloth , to sleep training to when do you start potty training to feeding , " @entity98 said			0
" we want parents to feel supported however they parent , and that 's that			1
" brutally honest : is it ok to let a child fail ? i posted the ad on my @entity128 page , and the parents who responded loved it			1
" i think the messaging is brilliant , " said @entity130 , an author , parent advocate and family internet safety advocate			0
" parents are so busy judging each other , they forget the big picture , the little ones , the exact ones we are supposed to be role models for			1
" @entity140 , a retired elementary school principal , wholeheartedly agreed			0
" when we wonder why the art of professional debate is gone , just look at how we reply on @entity128 to differing opinions			0
we could learn so very much from each other			0
our children live what they learn			0
" but , there are some critics : namely fathers ' groups who say the ad missed a key opportunity to showcase how much today 's dads are involved in modern parenting			1
@entity156 , founder of the blog @entity158 , wrote that he appreciated that dads were represented as one of the " gangs " and how the commercial touched on how , too often , fathers are made to feel less capable than mothers			1
but his beef has to do with the final tagline , " welcome to the @entity167 " and the hashtag # @entity169			1
" why go to the trouble to include fathers at all , if you 're just going to erase them with the final shot , " wrote @entity156			1
" do n't throw dads a bone only to snatch it away at the last minute			2
it 's irresponsible , disingenuous , and just plain inconsistent			0
... the omission of fathers from the final frames of the ad is completely contrary to the message of the campaign -- that we 're all in this together			1
" do modern dads get enough credit ? in response , the company says that " @entity167 " is a mindset and a campaign that is designed to be universal			1
" our campaign includes everybody			0
moms , dads , grandparents , passerbys , people who do n't have children			2
let 's all support the parents who are out there trying their best , " @entity98 said			2
of course , since @entity31 is one of the leading formulas for babies , you have to wonder how much of the ad is a way to buttress the bottle - feeding moms and increase interest in formula , especially with breastfeeding on the rise in @entity212			1
in the @entity212 , 77 % of infants start out breastfeeding , according to a 2013 report by the @entity215 ( @entity216 )			0
the report states that 49 % of infants were breastfeeding at 6 months in 2010 ; that 's up from 35 % in 2000			0
during the same time period , the breastfeeding rate at 12 months jumped from 16 % to 27 %			0
@entity98 said the ad , produced by the @entity223 agency , is about more than bottle - feeding vs. breastfeeding			2
the product , she notes , is n't even showcased in the ad			2
why are we still so squeamish about breastfeeding ? the company hopes it 's starting a conversation about modern parenting , which parents will keep having on playgrounds , and in workplaces and parking lots			1
" as a mom of three , one of the most difficult things i 've experienced personally is when people questioned the decisions that i made about raising my children in my family , " said @entity98 , a mom of twins about to turn 8 and a 5 - year - old			2
" so i 'll bet there is n't a mom or dad that 's reading your site that 's not shaking their heads saying , ' i 'm in agreement			0
you 're talking to me			0
' " what do you think about this new ad on the parenting wars ? share your thoughts with @entity262 on @entity263 or @entity264 on @entity128 .			2

new ad by formula maker @entity31 has been viewed more than 4 million times
the ad showcases how much parents judge decisions by other parents
fathers ' groups *applaud* the inclusion of dads but feel the tagline *alienates* modern fathers
