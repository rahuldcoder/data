-- @entity1 said friday it had discovered water on the moon , opening " a new chapter " that could allow for the development of a lunar space station			1
the discovery was announced by project scientist @entity8 at a midday news conference			0
" i 'm here today to tell you that indeed , yes , we found water			1
and we did n't find just a little bit ; we found a significant amount " -- about a dozen , two - gallon bucketfuls , he said , holding up several white plastic containers			0
the find is based on preliminary data collected when the @entity20 , or @entity20 , intentionally crashed october 9 into the permanently shadowed region of @entity22 near the moon 's south pole			0
after the satellite struck , a rocket flew through the debris cloud , measuring the amount of water and providing a host of other data , @entity8 said			2
the project team concentrated on data from the satellite 's spectrometers , which provide the best information about the presence of water , @entity8 said			1
a spectrometer helps identify the composition of materials by examining light they emit or absorb			0
although the goal of the $ 79 million mission was to determine whether there is water on the moon , discoveries in other areas are expected as studies progress , @entity8 and other scientists said at the briefing at @entity1 's @entity52 at @entity53 near @entity54 , @entity55			1
" the discovery opens a new chapter in our understanding of the moon , " the space agency said in a written statement shortly after the briefing began			1
@entity61 , chief lunar scientist at @entity62 in @entity63 , said the latest discovery also could unlock the mysteries of the solar system			0
he listed several options as sources for the water , including solar winds , comets , giant molecular clouds or even the moon itself through some kind of internal activity			2
the @entity77 also may have a role , @entity61 said			0
" if the water that was formed or deposited is billions of years old , these polar cold traps could hold a key to the history and evolution of the solar system , much as an ice core sample taken on @entity77 reveals ancient data , " @entity1 said in its statement			1
" in addition , water and other compounds represent potential resources that could sustain future lunar exploration			2

@entity1 : @entity93 could allow for development of lunar space station
information comes from satellite mission to moon last month
