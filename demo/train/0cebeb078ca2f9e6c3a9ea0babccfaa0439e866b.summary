-- @entity2 authorities say they have arrested four members of a gang that specialized in selling to @entity6 labs fat obtained from dead humans			1
officials are investigating the disappearance of at least 60 people they believe were killed by gang members in two mountainous states in central @entity2 , lead prosecutor @entity13 said friday			1
the four suspects have been charged with murder in the september slaying of a @entity2 man , the prosecutor said			1
" they killed to obtain human fat because there were @entity6 laboratories that would pay them , " @entity13 said			1
the suspects told authorities they were paid $ 15,000 for a liter ( about 1 quart ) of human fat			1
officials did not disclose what possible use laboratories could have for the human fat , but fat can be a component of cosmetics and is used in reconstructive or cosmetic surgery			1
the use of human fat for any purpose is extremely rare , however , physicians say			1
other suspects , including the @entity2 ringleader , have eluded capture , @entity13 said			1
authorities have the names of two @entity47 suspects who are being sought by @entity48 , the 188 - nation worldwide police agency , the prosecutor said			1
he declined to reveal their identities			0
@entity13 acknowledged the uniqueness of the allegations			0
" we are not making this up , " he said			0
" they have confessed to this			0
that 's what 's coming out now			0
" one of the suspects told officials he had been committing the murders for five years			1
according to a criminal complaint @entity13 filed november 18 , officials discovered on september 22 a small container containing a fat - like substance that had been stored at the @entity68 bus station in @entity69 , @entity2 's capital			1
on november 3 , the complaint says , suspect @entity70 was arrested after he retrieved three bottles from the @entity74 bus station			2
the bottles contained a substance authorities believe is human fat , the complaint says			1
lab tests are being performed to determine what the substance is			0
authorities identified the three other suspects as @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			2
the suspects identified each other for police in photo lineups , the complaint says			2
in addition to murder , @entity70 and @entity84 face weapons charges			0
@entity84 , @entity70 and @entity86 also face drug charges , authorities said			2
they are accused in the september 16 killing of @entity100 , the criminal complaint says			0
authorities believe the substance found at the bus stations is body fat obtained from @entity104			2
officials unearthed a partially buried male body november 13 in @entity108 state			2
they believe it was @entity104			0
@entity13 referred to the suspects as " brujos , " the @entity113 word for witches			2
he noted that the suspects are part of an @entity118 mountain culture that believes bodies can be used to ward off evil and prevent disasters			2
for example , he said , bodies are often buried at the entrances to mine shafts and bridges in the belief they will keep the structures from collapsing			0
authorities are calling the suspects " pishtacos , " which are @entity118 mythological creatures			2
in his 1996 book " @entity140 , " @entity2 author @entity132 mentions pishtacos extensively , saying they are half - white ghouls who live in caves , lurk along dark isolated roads and suck the fat out of anyone careless enough to travel @entity118 roads at night			1
@entity118 myth holds that the fat is used to make soaps , lubricants , healing potions and cosmetic creams			0
until the arrests , few believed that anything resembling pishtacos existed			0
" it 's an @entity118 myth that we 've now been able to prove , " said @entity151 , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office			0
some physicians say human fat is used in some medical procedures , but a few products were taken off the market because they were considered unsafe			1
the longevity of implants that use human tissue often is not as good , said @entity165 cosmetic surgeon @entity164			0
nor is there any advantage , he said , to using human fat in cosmetic creams or lotions			1
" they 're a little behind the times , " @entity164 said			0
" it makes a great moisturizer , but it has no advantages over good moisturizers that do n't use human fat			1
" @entity179 dermatologist @entity178 said he had never heard of human fat being sold on the black market			1
" the idea that anybody would use an injectable where you did n't know where it came from would be laughable if it were n't unethical and potentially dangerous , " he said			0
still , the notion of black market human fat seemed possible to him			1
" they steal kidneys , so why not this ? " he asked			0
" it is sick , but in the holocaust they did use skin for lamps			0
