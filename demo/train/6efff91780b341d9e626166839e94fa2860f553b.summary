not just a former president 's perspective , but also the very unique perspective from his philanthropic work , " said @entity27 , a communications executive in @entity28 , @entity29 , who organized an economic conference with both @entity0 and @entity31 last october			2
" he 's really a gifted speaker			0
he speaks in a language that everyone can understand			0
" @entity0 delivered 54 paid speeches in 2011 , roughly the same as his 2010 workload , but the marked increase in income can be credited to six overseas events that earned him the largest single paydays of his career			1
the most lucrative was a november speech in @entity46 to @entity48 - based telecom giant @entity47 -- $ 750,000			1
@entity0 also earned $ 700,000 for a march speech to a local newspaper publishing company in @entity51 , @entity52 , and $ 550,000 for a november speech to a business forum in @entity55 , @entity56			1
he earned $ 500,000 apiece for three events in @entity58 and @entity59 in may and in the @entity60 in december			2
prior to 2011 , the most @entity0 had earned from a single event was $ 525,000 for a 2008 speech in @entity63 , @entity64			1
the former president 's previous record for speech income earned in one year was in 2010 , when he earned $ 10.7 million for 52 events			1
his speech earnings last year were nearly double the $ 7.5 million he earned in 2009			2
almost half of the former president 's speech income last year , $ 6.1 million , came from 16 speeches delivered in 11 other countries , ranging from @entity75 to @entity76			2

his popularity on the international lecture circuit has taken him to 52 countries , where he has earned roughly $ 51 million			0
last month , @entity6 traveled to her 100th country as the nation 's top diplomat , which likely makes the @entity93 among the most well - traveled couples in the nation			0

@entity0 's annual earnings from speeches have varied from year to year depending on his schedule and availability			0
he gave only six paid speeches for $ 875,000 in 2004 , when he spent much of the year writing his memoirs and recovering from heart bypass surgery			0
his $ 13.4 million haul from 2011 more than doubles the $ 5.7 million he earned in 2008 , when he spent half the year campaigning for his wife 's unsuccessful presidential bid			1
that year , @entity6 loaned her presidential campaign a total of $ 13.2 million out of the couple 's personal funds			2
the @entity93 ended up eating the cost of that loan because the campaign was unable to repay the amount by the deadline required by federal campaign finance laws			0
however , since @entity6 suspended her presidential campaign on june 7 , 2008 , her husband has earned $ 36.3 million in speaking fees for 162 events , canceling out the impact of the loan by almost three-fold			1
