-- in the " @entity3 , " @entity1 and @entity2 play world - famous @entity5 magicians			1
@entity1 wears spangled red velvet and a poufy wig that makes him look like @entity9 , and @entity2 sports an even more unreal - looking lanky mop			1
each night , they kick off their act by doing a smiley little dance to '' @entity14 , '' that cheesy - catchy @entity16 classic			1
this trademark fanfare places the two somewhere between @entity18 and the head - bopping @entity20 brothers from " @entity22 , " and i chuckled , with mild pleasure , at the dopey kitschiness of it			1
i assumed ( or at least hoped ) that the dance would be a warm - up for the much bigger laughs to come			1
@entity1 's @entity3 and @entity2 's @entity29 have been partners ever since they were childhood geeks who began inventing their own magic tricks back in the early ' 80s			1
they 've been doing their sold - out show at @entity35 's for so long now that they 're sick of it , and sick of each other , too			2
@entity40 , off stage , is a toxic diva who makes groupies sign contracts and treats @entity43 like an indentured servant			2
one night , the two are working with a brand - new assistant , @entity47 ( @entity46 ) , performing a classic trick that requires @entity40 and @entity47 to huddle inside a box , which @entity50 jabs with swords			2
squeezed inside the compartment , @entity40 asks @entity47 to sleep with him that night , and when she turns him down , he throws a hissy fit			0
it should be an over-the - top funny moment , as @entity1 lashes out with a faux - aristocratic hauteur			1
he 's going for a @entity59 meltdown , yet there 's something a little too controlled about @entity1 's bombastic nuttiness			1
the effect is n't hilariously insane			0
once again , it 's just kind of mild			0
' @entity3 ' : box office magic ? " @entity3 " seems to be reaching for the tone of early @entity68 brothers movies like @entity69 , and also for the madcap hostility of @entity71			1
yet in too many scenes , the comedy does n't quite ignite			0
the movie rarely climbs out of the chuckle zone , except for a few times when @entity77 is on screen as @entity40 and @entity50 's rival , a stringy - haired , tattooed street magician who specializes in cable - tv stunts that represent the new era : he 's like @entity84 as a @entity86 pain freak			2
the gleam of madness in @entity77 's eye finds a perfect home in this role , which has him upping the ante on how far he 'll go ( holding in his urine for 12 days , spending a night on hot coals ) , all as a way to bedazzle jaded audiences			0
' glee ' : @entity100 to return he beats @entity40 and @entity50 at their own game , and their act starts to fall apart			0
and so , in a way , does the movie			0
instead of getting wilder , it turns earnest and mushy , as @entity40 , humbled by failure , starts performing at a retirement home , where he befriends @entity111 ( @entity112 ) , the cranky magician whose @entity114 tape first inspired him as a kid			0
@entity3 has a real affection for the world of illusionists , a showbiz demimonde it treats with simultaneous snark and awe			1
yet the movie itself is too cautious and unimaginative to bring off what a great magic trick â € ” or comedy â € ” should do : make us laugh out loud with surprise			0
