-- for students , parents and teachers in @entity4 , @entity5 , the week has been a disorienting one after a high school shooting left three teenagers dead			1
as the community of 5,100 tries to regain the normalcy that was shattered by violence , the @entity4 school district has decided to resume classes friday			1
throughout the week , the school system has offered counseling			1
teachers and staff members were asked to return to school , where they could meet with counselors , on wednesday			1
parents and students were also encouraged to come to campus on thursday , when counseling will also be offered			1
after such a traumatic incident , counselors focus on two stages of recovery : the immediate response of helping people feel safe and the longer - term process of helping them cope			1
@entity31 , disaster response coordinator at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , worked with youth , faculty and families in the aftermath of the 1999 @entity41 shootings			1
after thousands of hours with them , @entity31 and his colleagues learned that there 's no quick fix			2
some kids required as many as three years of assistance			1
there 's a wide range of reactions , and it could depend on how close they were to the kids who were hurt and what they witnessed , he said			1
for families who lost children and students who lost friends , it 's a much more difficult struggle			1
most people process the events and heal , but about 8 % to 15 % are likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder , said @entity62 , professor of psychology at @entity64 , who counseled survivors of the shootings there			2
after a school shooting , students may be reluctant to return to classes and resume their normal academic life , experts say			1
on monday morning , a student identified as @entity75 fired shots in the @entity78 cafeteria			2
police say the 17 - year - old sophomore confessed to firing 10 rounds and was described by the county prosecutor as having chosen his victims " at random			2
" the victims are @entity85 , 16 , a teen who loved to ski and found work maintaining the computerized pins at the local bowling alley , who died monday ; @entity90 , 16 , who died tuesday morning ; and @entity91 , 17 , who was declared brain dead early tuesday			2
there is an expectation of safety at school , so it 's natural for students , parents and staff members to feel angry , shocked and scared			1
at this point , the children are probably receiving traumatic stress event counseling , said @entity105 , the executive director of the @entity106 of @entity107			1
he is not involved in the counseling of the @entity78 students			1
" the first need of the kids is going to be to feel safe and doing what they can to make the kids in the high school understand that they are safe , " he said			1
in the short term , counselors help connect kids , parents and faculty with their natural supports such as friends , family and others whom they 're comfortable being around , to emphasize feelings of safety			1
children may have fears about going back to school , which counselors try to assuage by identifying whom the child can be with in order to feel safe			1
" kids are going to go through a range of reactions in the next days and weeks , " @entity31 said parents have also been through distress , because they were probably panicking over the safety of their kids , @entity105 said			1
the initial counseling can reassure people that it 's ok to be upset			1
" it 's not swept under the rug and ' let 's pretend it did n't happen , ' " @entity105 said			0
after the shootings at @entity64 that left 32 students dead in april 2007 , @entity62 , a clinical psychologist , was one of the counselors who went into classes to discuss the symptoms of depression , acute stress disorder and @entity155			1
@entity64 students find support , outlet for grief online " people typically have nightmares , " @entity62 said			2
people are typically having difficulty concentrating ; they might be irritable			0
they might snap at others			0
they might have tendency to avoid the situation			0
all of these are very normal reactions			0
" for most people , it takes days and weeks to move on with their routines			0
" what we try to tell individuals is that one can expect that to happen , " he said			0
" they are not ' crazy			0
' those are very normal reactions to abnormal actions			0
that 's comforting to most individuals			0
" those who had symptoms persisting beyond a month were encouraged to see mental health specialists , @entity62 said			0
" the classic response is avoidance , because people do n't want to think about it or go to places that remind them of it , " @entity62 said			0
research published by @entity62 and his colleagues in 2011 found that 15.4 % of @entity64 students experienced high levels of post-traumatic stress three to four months after the shootings			2
life at @entity64 a year later some of the " real therapy " happens when the initial shock wears off , @entity31 said			1
@entity31 and his colleagues ran several support groups after the shootings at @entity41 in 1999 , still the deadliest event at an @entity207 , in which 12 students and a teacher died			1
debunking the myths of @entity41 , 10 years later in group therapy sessions , the counselors tried to group kids together who had similar levels of exposure to the incident			1
for instance , students in the library had some of the worst experiences , as this is where much of the massacre took place and where the two shooters killed themselves			2
ideally , these kids would not be in the support group with students who saw or heard different things			1
" if you mix those groups , there 's a risk that the stories they tell could actually re-traumatize kids who did n't see that , " @entity31 said			2
in @entity41 , the demand for services related to that shooting hit its peak a year and a half after the shooting , @entity31 said			0
traumatic memories flooded back for some when they heard helicopters , since there were a lot of helicopters in the air on the day of the @entity41 shooting			0
nothing the same after @entity41 there were ongoing programs for up to three years after the shooting , but not everyone needed that extended support			0
a small number of people affected by the incident , to this day , struggle with memories that come back on occasions such as the anniversary of the shooting , @entity31 said			0
at @entity64 , @entity62 said , some individuals present at the shooting did n't come forward for treatment until 4Â½ years later			0
students should be encouraged to talk about it with their support system when they 're ready , said @entity62			2
" children and families should not be forced to talk about it , because compulsive retelling has adverse effects on individuals , " he said			0
another strategy is to encourage adolescents to write their feelings in a journal , @entity105 said			0
" when emotions stay stuck within themselves , that 's when grief tends to become more complicated , " he said			0
an adolescent 's recovery from a tragedy like this can be a long process that 's very individual			2
some kids bounced right back ; others took more time			2
the community still remembers the event but has largely moved forward , @entity31 said of @entity41			2
" sometimes , people talk about wanting to get back to normal			0
and you sort of have to help people realize that it 's never going to be quite the way it was , " he said			0
" there will be a new normal you reach , but it will be different than how things were before			0
but it can still be good , and you can be productive , and you can get through this and come out of it even stronger			0
" @entity0 's @entity305 contributed to this story .			0

@entity4 , @entity5 , schools open for counseling for teachers , parents and students
first step is to make kids , parents and faculty feel safe , counselors say
much of " real therapy " happens long after the event
