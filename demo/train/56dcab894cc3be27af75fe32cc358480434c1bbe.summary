@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 , the capital of @entity1 's far - western @entity3 , was calm but definitely tense friday , four years after violent clashes left hundreds dead and exposed deep ethnic rifts in the region			1
in the days leading up to the anniversary , and in the wake of recent attacks that left 35 dead in @entity3 , @entity1 authorities have taken measures to thwart further unrest			1
paramilitary police in camouflaged fatigues with automatic weapons and riot gear have been stationed outside key points throughout the capital , including government buildings , banks and major intersections			0
while it is not unusual for there to be a visible police presence in a city known for past troubles , the number of armed troops on the streets has increased dramatically -- one main street next to a local theater in the city was backed up with a column of police trucks , armored personnel carriers and other riot - control vehicles			1
according to tourist operators and local residents , the government has also banned all night markets and non-tourist public events to avoid crowds gathering at this sensitive time			0
periodic bursts of violence are nothing new in @entity3 , a resource - rich region of western @entity1 where the arrival of waves of @entity50 people over the decades has fueled tensions with the @entity52 , a @entity54 - speaking , predominantly @entity53 ethnic group			1
@entity52 have complained of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces in @entity3 , despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony			1
in @entity1 as a whole , @entity50 account for 92 % of the population			1
they now make up about 40 % of the population of @entity3 , where @entity52 used to be predominant			1
the violence last wednesday -- when police stations were attacked by a mob in the remote township of @entity69 , about 250 kilometers southeast of @entity0 -- was the worst the region has seen since 2009 , when rioting between the two ethnic groups left around 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in @entity0			1
this followed clashes in april when 21 people were killed in @entity3 's @entity77 prefecture			1
the government has blamed recent attacks on " gangsters " and " religious extremists " who they claim have links to foreign jihadi groups			0
but many scholars and uyghur diaspora groups dispute this official interpretation			0
" the increasing frequency with which these incidents occur illustrates the @entity1 's reticence to address the root causes of the tensions that are escalating , " said the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) , a @entity90 - based @entity52 advocacy group			1
it used an abbreviation of @entity1 to describe @entity1			2
meanwhile , @entity1 state media has widely reported on other measures taken by local authorities to curb further unrest ahead of friday 's anniversary			2
the local public security department in @entity3 has offered a 50,000 to 100,000 - @entity107 ( us $ 8,162 to 16,319 ) reward for information regarding what they called " separatist activities , " the @entity104 reported			2
it also released a wanted list of 11 suspects , encouraging residents to provide information			0
police also called on the public to hand in any " dangerous knives , explosives and propaganda materials on terrorism or violent crimes " they may have -- police officers in @entity0 were actually registering knives this week , with blades more than 8 inches confiscated			2
" i ca n't display anything longer than this , " said one local merchant who had just been registered by police			0
rumors have also been rife in this city before and during the july 5 anniversary			1
uyghur restaurants are struggling to get @entity50 customers at times because of rumors that they could be looking to poison their customers			2
in the center of the capital , street vendors say domestic tourist numbers , normally at their peak at this time of year , are dramatically down because of the fear of attacks			0
but despite the heavy police presence and the rumors , the city continues to function			0
though the @entity150 , a major tourist attraction , was largely quiet this week , other shopping streets teemed with locals bargaining for a range of products , from scarves to fruit			0
they did n't seem to pay much attention to the paramilitary police units who now patrol 24 hours a day -- some @entity50 tourists were even taking photos of the patrols			2
but this remains a divided city			0
uyghurs and @entity50 generally frequent different shops , live in different neighborhoods and go to different schools			0
but most people seem reluctant to speak about these divisions , a sign perhaps of the tightening grip the security forces have over this remote city .			0
