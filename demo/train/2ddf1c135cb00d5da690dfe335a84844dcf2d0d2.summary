-- the @entity1 has suspended the licenses of two nurses named by police in a criminal investigation of " disrupted " catheter lines at a hospital neonatal intensive care unit , the board 's executive director said wednesday			1
the two nurses , identified in board documents as @entity12 and @entity13 , have not been arrested or charged with a crime , but the nursing board found that the results of the ongoing police investigation warranted the license suspensions			2
nursing board director @entity19 said that @entity20 , a nurse for four years , and @entity22 , a nurse for 19 years , worked at @entity24 ' @entity23 , where hospital officials and police had been investigating several incidents in which catheters had been " disrupted			1
" the incidents involved peripherally inserted central catheters , or @entity32 lines , @entity23 said in a statement last week			1
the specialized catheters provide long - term access to a vein and are used to provide nutrition , give medication or draw blood , the statement said			2
the hospital launched an internal review in february , concentrating on " product performance and staff education , " the statement said , and no disruptions were reported for several weeks			1
after another one occurred , the hospital retained a plastics engineer with an independent lab to evaluate the lines			0
the facility then discovered that another kind of catheter , an umbilical arterial catheter , also had been disrupted			1
such catheters have a low failure rate , the hospital said			2
hospital officials increased security and installed cameras as part of their review			2
they also contacted @entity24 @entity64 and regulatory agencies , including the @entity1 and the state @entity66			0
there were two " unexpected outcomes " involving the infant patients at the unit , the hospital statement said			2
" one patient required an additional procedure and is currently doing well , " the statement said			0
" the second patient remains in critical condition in the neonatal intensive care unit			1
" law enforcement officials notified the nursing board last month that @entity22 and @entity20 were part of their investigation into the problems at @entity23 , @entity79 said			1
the board took quick action to suspend the women 's licenses			0
according to the legal summary suspension of license documents , police found that the @entity23 incidents involved " intentional patient harm			1
" the documents for each nurse say the board found in both cases that the nurse violated the @entity99 , with those violations including engaging " in conduct likely to deceive , defraud or endanger a patient or the general public			0
" the board found that it " would be a danger to the public health , safety or welfare " for the nurses to have unrestricted licenses and that suspension of the licenses required emergency action			0
accordingly , the board suspended the licenses			0
attempts to reach @entity22 and @entity20 wednesday evening were unsuccessful			0
in all , 14 catheters were " disrupted " at the neonatal intensive care unit , the hospital said			1
a hospital spokeswoman would not provide further comment wednesday			0
police were referring questions to the hospital .			0
