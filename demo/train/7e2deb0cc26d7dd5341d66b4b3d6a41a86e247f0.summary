@entity0 has one of the fastest growing economies in the world			1
its rapid industrial progress , growing military strength , large population and steadily increasing international influence , are all clear signs that @entity0 will have a secure place among the super powers in the near future			1
the question , raised in a book by journalist @entity14 , is not if @entity0 will rule the world , but simply when ? in the interview below , @entity14 argues that in the twenty - first century , @entity0 will challenge our perception of what it is to be modern , and the @entity20 will be forced to learn from growing eastern powers			1
in his view , @entity0 will become the largest economy in the world within less than two decades			1
the former @entity26 editor is a senior fellow at the @entity27 at @entity28 , and a visiting professor at @entity30 , @entity31			0
his bestseller " when @entity35 and the @entity36 , " was first published in 2009 and has since sold over a quarter of a million copies and been translated into fourteen languages			0
the @entity38 ' chief business commentator @entity37 interviewed @entity14 at @entity39 2014 , an event where @entity41 was a media partner			2
an edited version of the interview is below			0
@entity37 : your book is called when @entity0 rules the world not if , why when ? @entity14 : well , who knows what will happen , but i think that @entity0 's rise will continue			1
we are witness to the greatest global economic transformation there 's ever been			0
the result of it will be that @entity0 will become , in time , the leading power in the world			1
but i do n't think it 's ever going to rule the world , i was taking poetic license with the title ! jg : it seems to me that @entity0 do n't see themselves as a threat or as an inevitable power in the same way we do ? @entity14 : i think that 's correct			1
the @entity0 always stress the fact that they are a poor country and that they are responsible for a fifth of the world 's population			2
the only reason they 're a large economic power is because they have so many people , so they 've got a long way to go			0
the way that the @entity0 conceive of themselves in the world is very different from the western tradition			1
i imagine that most people think that as @entity0 rises it will be a bit like the @entity92 in some shape or form in the way that it expresses itself , and i think this is probably wrong			2
the whole @entity0 tradition is very different from this , they never really colonized other areas			2
we tend to think the way that the @entity20 has done things is emblematic of the way everyone else will do it			0
jg : it 's quite difficult then , to see @entity0 through a western frame			2
you 're not @entity0 how do you get to understand it ? and if it 's going to have such a huge impact on our lives , how do we get to understand it ? @entity14 : with great difficulty ! the difficulty with the western mentality is that for 200 years we 've dominated culture , ways of thinking , the economy and military			1
so we have not really been open to other cultures and ways of thinking , we 've thought that progress is about westernization and becoming more like us			0
and this is a tremendous weakness in western culture in an era when the center of gravity is going somewhere else , and we are going to be in the position where we will need to learn from something else			0
now we 're confronted with the task of making sense of @entity0 and it is going to be extremely difficult			0
to understand @entity0 we need to start by accepting that it is very different from western societies and it will remain very different and only if we understand @entity0 in its specificity , can we make sense of it			1
and in my view it will take the whole of this century -- this is not a short term operation .			0

it is clear that @entity0 is on the way to becoming a super power
@entity14 believes @entity0 will become the largest economy in the world in 20 years
to understand @entity0 we need to accept that it is very different from western societies
