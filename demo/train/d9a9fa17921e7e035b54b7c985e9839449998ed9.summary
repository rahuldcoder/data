" the important thing is this was not a decisive game			0
what is important is that people now realise we are here and have got our act together			0
" as has become characteristic in this tournament , the opening exchanges were extremely cautious with both sides limited to shots from distance			0
@entity6 opened @entity3 up with a sharp counter-attack after 21 minutes , the ball breaking to @entity51 on the edge of the area , but he dragged his shot wastefully wide			1
perhaps unsurprisingly the opening goal came from a set piece , with @entity12 jumping above @entity3 captain @entity57 and @entity15 to meet @entity51 's free - kick with a firm header into the corner			1
@entity3 appeared relieved when the half - time whistle arrived having struggled to cope with @entity6 's pressing game and spent much of the time bickering with each other or the referee			1
the defending champions were forced into a change at the break with goalkeeper @entity69 replaced by @entity70			1
@entity3 raised the tempo of the game in the second half and @entity74 almost converted a fine cross from @entity76			2
but the @entity9 remained a danger on the break and @entity78 should have done better with a shot which found the side netting			0
with the game seemingly drifting away , @entity3 coach @entity30 made a crucial change , bringing on @entity83 and reverting from a 4 - 3 - 3 to a 4 - 4 - 2 system			2
the rethink energized @entity3 and their equalizer arrived just after the hour mark			0
a corner kick from the left flew over the outstretched fist of @entity14 , leaving @entity92 with a simple tap - in on the volley			2
@entity14 was a busy man for the rest of the game , pulling off saves from @entity74 and @entity98 as @entity3 pressed for a winner but @entity6 held on for a creditable draw			1
" we played this game equally against the current world champions , " @entity6 coach @entity101 told @entity31			2
" to play against such a rival with such skills is a very good sign for us			0
it gives is a lot of confidence going ahead in this tournament			0
