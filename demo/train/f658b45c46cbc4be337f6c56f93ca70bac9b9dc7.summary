@entity0 / @entity0 -- catching a glimpse of the disputed islands in the distance , you ca n't help but wonder how such unremarkable rocks have soured diplomatic relations for so many decades			1
the rocky , unforgiving terrain reflects the current relationship between the two protagonists , @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity14 calls the islands @entity0 , @entity13 calls them @entity0			1
both countries claim them , @entity14 controls them			2
and the public relations battle to win international support is in full swing			0
the @entity11 government organized a helicopter trip to the territory thursday , inviting @entity1 as well as other international media , in a move that angered @entity13			1
in a statement to @entity1 , @entity12 's @entity28 called the trip " extremely regrettable and totally unacceptable			2
" read : why @entity31 is arguing over its islands @entity12 says @entity11 is illegally occupying the islands			1
the police presence is the first thing you notice when you touch down			0
@entity11 has had armed guards stationed on the island since the 1950s			1
the head of the @entity0 guards , @entity39 says , " @entity12 wants to take our land by force			1
this has been our land since ancient times and we have to protect it			0
" @entity13 recently asked @entity14 to resolve the matter diplomatically by referring it jointly to the @entity49 in the @entity50 , but @entity14 refused , saying there was no question of sovereignty			1
@entity12 may now apply to the @entity50 unilaterally			2
read : disputed islands : who claims what ? @entity58 - do is 71 years old			2
he and his wife are the only permanent residents here			0
when i ask him if life is hard on an island that can be cut off from the outside world for weeks at a time in bad weather , he simply says , " i chose to come here , so i ca n't complain			0
and what is there to complain about ? everywhere you look you see fish			0
" these waters are rich fishing grounds , the reason @entity76 visited so often since the 1970s before moving here in 1991			1
there are also believed to be gas reserves here			1
no one knows how large the reserves might be , but they 're potentially big enough to merit a diplomatic spat			2
and then the tourists arrive			0
police salute the daily ferry as it docks in the tiny port			0
once the gangway is in place , more than 100 visitors swarm onto the island , some carrying @entity11 flags , others shouting with joy as their feet touch the ground			1
it 's a patriotic duty for some , a religious experience for others			0
one group of @entity102 gathers in a circle to pray , giving thanks for being allowed to visit			0
but the visit is brief , 20 minutes later they are herded back onto the ferry , but not before telling the assembled journalists how much the visit means to them			0
@entity76 , 40 , says , " i 'm a native of @entity11 and an @entity111 citizen , but in my blood i 'm @entity11 ... i feel so great to be here ... it really makes me upset when @entity12 claims this island , it 's absurd , and it should not be tolerated			1
" others talk of their joy at making this pilgrimage and showing their support for @entity11 's claim on the islands			2
but despite a choreographed visit designed to show @entity14 's side of the story , the dispute shows no signs of waning			2
in fact , the trip itself looks like a fresh chapter of tension in a dispute that has raged between the two neighbors for decades			0
@entity1 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			0
