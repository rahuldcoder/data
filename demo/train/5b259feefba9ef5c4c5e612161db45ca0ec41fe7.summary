and on thursday a @entity7 passenger plane crashed in the area , apparently with the loss of all 298 souls on board			1
if it turns out that the unfortunate civilian airliner was also shot down , @entity5 and its local allies could again be implicated			1
understandably , the international community will wonder whether this portends an escalation in the @entity18 ambitions there			0
vice president @entity20 is already sure he knows what happened , telling an audience in @entity23 on thursday that the plane has " been shot down , not an accident			1
blown out of the sky			0
" @entity2 president @entity27 calls this " an act of terrorism " and is pointing the rhetorical finger at @entity29			0
while all the facts are not yet in , it is indeed possible that a @entity5 surface - to - air missile brought the civilian plane down			1
if so , @entity5 or its @entity2 separatist allies bear heavy responsibility for this tragedy			1
but that would not indicate that @entity5 president @entity41 's overall strategy in the region has changed			1
if a @entity5 missile did bring down @entity45 , it is likely that it was the result of a tragic error , a case of mistaken identity , rather than an intentional act by either the @entity5 military or their @entity2 separatist allies			1
such accidents are sadly not unprecedented			0
in 1983 , @entity53 tracking an @entity55 electronic reconnaissance plane operating near their naval facilities on the @entity57 mistakenly shot down @entity58 with the loss of 269 passengers , including a hard - line anticommunist @entity55 congressman			2
and during the @entity65 in the @entity66 in 1988 , a @entity55 @entity63 cruiser -- the @entity64 -- mistook @entity67 for an attacking @entity69 warplane and shot it down , killing 290 civilians			2
such tragic accidents happen in wartime or periods of heightened international tensions			0
if it turns out that this is what happened in this case , the @entity5 military and their @entity2 allies will suffer a well - deserved black eye			1
the @entity5 @entity53 ought to have been able to distinguish a civilian airliner , operating on a previously filed flight plan and with its electronic identification systems operating , from @entity2 warplanes			2
if they gave a high - altitude system to the @entity2 separatists , then they also should have anticipated that an accident like this could have happened given that the @entity91 has only primitive radar systems			0
but there is blame to go around			0
why did @entity45 's flight path take it right over a war zone in which two warplanes had just been shot down ? you have to wonder what the airline and the @entity2 and @entity5 civilian air controllers were thinking			1
even if events transpired as @entity20 and @entity27 surmise , it 's unlikely to indicate any major change in the @entity18 's ambitions in @entity3			2
there is no evidence that @entity41 has deviated from his strategy of keeping the pot boiling in the region and begun moving toward something more ambitious			0
indeed , all the evidence suggests that he understands that the @entity91 is not the @entity113			0
the best he can hope for is to use the @entity116 insurgency as a lever to pry @entity118 out of its increasingly @entity120 orientation and as a bargaining chip with the new @entity2 regime to get it to adopt a more federal political system that will keep @entity3 suspended between @entity125 and @entity126			2
this is , of course , a cold - blooded machiavellian strategy of realpolitik			0
but such a cynical approach to the @entity3 is not incompatible with this event being nothing more than a tragic blunder .			1

@entity7 passenger plane possibly was shot down in @entity3
@entity137 : if true , @entity5 and its local allies could be blamed
@entity137 : if a @entity5 missile did bring down @entity45 , it likely was a tragic error
