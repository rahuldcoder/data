-- it 's a revolutionary decree			2
in the midst of the fight against @entity8 rebels seeking to turn the clock back to the 7th century , a @entity3 region in @entity4 has just approved a new law ordering equality for women			1
take that , @entity14 ! the status of women has become one of the ideological battlegrounds in the fierce war between the self - described @entity20 and the @entity3 defenders , who have received air support from the @entity23			1
with the defiant decree by the small canton , the @entity24 are doubling down , staking out a position as the stalwarts of modernity , not intimidated by opponents whose brutality has caused other armies to flee			2
the change is not just symbolic			0
it is a real transformation in the legal status of women			0
the timing of the decree is not accidental , and it is certainly brazen			0
it is a shot across the ideological bow of islamists who have made a concerted push to spread their so - called caliphate 's views throughout the @entity47 world			2
and it is also a message to the @entity50			1
the @entity24 are tacitly saying " look at us			2
we are the ones who share your ideas about human rights and equality			1
we are the ones in this many - sided conflict that deserves your support			0
" the decree was issued by the @entity61 district of @entity4 's @entity63 province , about 100 miles from the now - legendary town of @entity65 , where armed @entity3 men and women are holding their positions , battling to prevent the ultra-radical @entity20 , also known as @entity14 , from overrunning their territory			1
kurdish - majority provinces in northern @entity4 declared self - rule in 2013 as the rest of @entity4 exploded into civil war			2
the @entity24 , an ethnic @entity47 minority spread mostly across @entity76 , @entity4 , @entity77 and @entity78 , have faced repression and have fought for independence			1
although women have been a part of @entity3 fighting forces since long before @entity14 swept across @entity4 and @entity76 , women have fought for full equality			1
in remote , rural areas , conservative practices have remained the norm			0
but the new rules in the @entity91 district call for equal pay and equal inheritance rights			0
until now , women were not allowed to inherit			0
they also declare the testimony of a woman in court equally valuable as that of a man			0
in addition , the rule establishes maternity leave for women and , importantly , it mandates that no woman be married without her own consent , and never under the age of 18			0
the contrast could not be sharper			0
@entity14 has engaged in the systematic rape of women , and even young girls have been handed off as " wives " as a reward for militants			1
the @entity20 has published online articles declares that capturing and selling women as slaves is an acceptable , even beneficial practice			0
and while @entity14 labels anyone who does n't share its radical religious interpretation as an infidel or an apostate , subject to execution , the @entity24 of @entity61 says their rules on full equality will apply to everyone in their ethnically - mixed district			1
@entity14 already occupies about one - third of @entity128 , according to the @entity129			2
in areas under @entity14 rule , women are required to cover completely and may not leave their homes without a male relative			1
still , @entity14 , too , claims it empowers women			1
like the @entity24 , @entity14 has also established all - women brigades , complete with weapons			1
but their role is diametrically different from that of @entity3 women			1
the @entity14 female brigades serve many purposes			2
they help undercut the notion that women are less free under their @entity8 rule and they help encourage new recruits			2
they also serve important practical functions			0
the women 's battalions also help in body searches , preventing men dressed as women from moving through checkpoints			2
then there is the more disturbing aspect of the @entity14 all - women brigades			1
they act as the enforcers of the rules that oppress women			0
they check adherence to the dress code , for example			0
they are the morality police , and their principal job is to implement the day to day oppression of women			0
there are reports of armed women stopping girls in the street , quizzing them on their knowledge of @entity47 and of @entity14 rules			1
it 's a long way from the role of female @entity24 fighters , who are an integral part of the military force			1
in @entity65 , about a third of the warriors are women			0
one of the top commanders is a woman			0
their job is to do battle , to defend the city			0
to be sure , the @entity24 do n't have a perfect record on the treatment of women			1
honor killings , female genital mutilation and domestic violence have plagued their communities			0
in the autonomous @entity3 region of northern @entity76 , the government has outlawed the practices , but they have proven difficult to eradicate			1
still , the @entity24 are comparatively more modern than many of their neighbors			2
and the pressure from @entity14 may just be moving them even farther along the road to equality			1
for women defending their territory , it is a delightful irony .			0

@entity210 : @entity3 region in @entity4 approved new law ordering equality for women
move shows ideological battleground between @entity14 , which *enslaves* women , and @entity24
@entity220 says it 's message to @entity50 on human rights and equality , to encourage @entity225 's support
@entity220 : battle against @entity14 helping @entity3 women *achieve* equality
