@entity0 -- parents are finding it more difficult to keep their children 's private personal data from being collected by mobile phone apps , according to a new report			1
the @entity8 is urging mobile phone app developers and phone companies to make it easier for parents to control the personal information being collected by smartphone apps			1
it 's the second time this year the agency has looked at the issue			0
since the first report in february , the @entity8 said it found that almost nothing has been done by developers or phone companies to improve transparency			1
only 16 % of apps provided parents with a link to a privacy policy or other disclosure before an app is downloaded , the first survey found			2
in the follow - up , researchers found similar results , with 20 percent of the apps linking to general disclosure information or a privacy policy , the report said			0
" even more troubling , the results showed that many of the apps shared certain information with third parties -- such as device id , geolocation , or phone number -- without disclosing that fact to parents , " the @entity8 said			1
by using the information collected through mobile devices , companies could potentially develop detailed profiles about children without a parent 's knowledge or consent , the @entity8 said			1
" our study shows that kids ' apps siphon an alarming amount of information from mobile devices without disclosing this fact to parents , " said @entity8 chairman @entity54 in a statement released with monday 's report			1
through apps , kids can make purchases right from the device			0
the @entity8 said parents have reported their children racking up hundreds of dollars in charges they were n't aware of until the bill arrived			2
" parents should be given the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to allow their children to use apps with these capabilities , " the @entity8 report said			1
a recent phenomenon of the digital age , apps -- or applications -- are programs that mobile phones users can purchase and install on their devices			0
apps can include everything from games to medical monitoring software			0
the market for mobile apps continues to grow at an explosive rate			0
as of september , there were more than 700,000 apps available in @entity98 's @entity97 , a 40 percent increase since december 2011 , and more than 700,000 apps available in @entity101 , an 80 percent increase since the beginning of 2012 , the @entity8 said			2
an investigation is planned to determine whether some mobile app developers are violating the @entity105 or are engaging in unfair or deceptive business practices , the @entity8 said			0
the agency urged developers and marketers to work together and develop accurate privacy disclosures regarding what data is collected through apps used by kids .			0
