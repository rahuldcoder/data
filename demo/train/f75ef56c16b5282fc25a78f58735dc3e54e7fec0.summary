@entity0 -- two @entity3 justices engaged in a late - night exchange of harsh words before the execution early wednesday of a convicted @entity8 killer who had been sitting on death row for nearly three decades			1
justices @entity10 and @entity12 disagreed over whether to grant a stay of execution for @entity15 the stay eventually was denied , and about an hour later , at 2:34 a.m. , @entity15 was put to death by lethal injection at a @entity20 , @entity8 , prison			1
the 53 - year - old inmate had been convicted of murder in a 1980 shooting spree at a convenience store near the state capital			0
the victims included 12 - year - old @entity27 , son of the store owner , who was wounded			0
two other men sitting in a nearby taxicab also were shot to death			0
@entity10 , who was initially presented the last - minute appeal by @entity15 's lawyers , would have granted the stay , along with justice @entity35			1
@entity10 was concerned that too much time had elapsed between sentencing and the planned execution , amounting perhaps to cruel and unusual punishment			1
" @entity15 bears little , if any , responsibility for this delay , " said @entity10 , who said procedural hurdles at the appellate stage for capital defendants created what he called " underlying evils of intolerable delay			1
" " the delay itself subjects death row inmates to decades of especially severe , dehumanizing conditions of confinement			2
" it is an issue that the 89 - year - old justice has long urged his colleagues to address , with little success			0
in his early years on the high court in the mid- 1970s he had supported the resumption of the death penalty after a four - year moratorium imposed by the @entity3			2
but in recent years , he has voiced his opposition to capital punishment , particularly in cases involving inmates asserting their right to challenge their sentences			0
@entity12 reacted strongly to @entity10 ' statement			1
the conservative jurist said the inmate had challenged his conviction and sentence for nearly 29 years and " now contends that the very proceedings he used to contest his sentence should prohibit the state from carrying it out			1
" " in @entity10 ' view , it seems the state can never get the timing just right			2
the reason , he has said , is that the death penalty itself is wrong			0
" as long as our system affords capital defendants the procedural safeguards this court has long endorsed , defendants who avail themselves of these procedures will face the delays @entity10 laments			0
" then @entity12 goes on to say there are " alternatives , " citing the custom in @entity99 centuries ago to carry out an execution the day after a conviction			2
" i have no doubt that such a system would avoid the diminishing justification problem @entity10 identifies , but i am equally confident it would find little support from this court			0
" the high court had been presented with @entity15 's emergency appeal early tuesday afternoon , but apparently the time needed to produce the @entity10 and @entity12 statements delayed the high court from issuing its denial of a stay until 1:38 a.m. wednesday			1
the execution was carried out as scheduled , with no problems reported by corrections officials .			0
