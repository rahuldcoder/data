-- @entity1 drum major @entity2 walked into the darkness of @entity4 in a parking lot in @entity6 , @entity7 , last fall in the hope of gaining respect from his fellow band members			1
on november 19 , @entity11 and the rest of the band were in @entity6 for the @entity15 football game , the last game of the football season			2
it would be @entity11 's last chance of the year to endure the " cross over , " the name for the process of being fully initiated into the band			1
according to witnesses , @entity11 first endured a pummeling with fists and bass drum mallets as he sat in what the band describes as the " hot seat			1
" the drum major then would have to " cross over , " making his way through a gauntlet of punches , drumsticks and mallets toward the back of the bus			1
the bus rocked back and forth violently as other band members lined the aisle , witnesses said , with some grabbing onto his body , trying to keep him from reaching the back of the bus , a signal that he 'd made it through			1
champion eventually would make it to the point where he could touch his hand to the back wall , but he would never make it back to his hotel			2
champion , 26 , died last year because of " hemorrhagic shock due to soft tissue hemorrhage , due to blunt force trauma , " the @entity58 medical examiner said			1
more than 2,000 pages of police interviews with witnesses and defendants who were aboard the bus on the day of @entity11 's death paint the first full blow - by - blow account of what happened on the night they say @entity11 and two others were hazed			1
@entity1 band fraternity charter revoked after hazing investigation @entity11 's roommate @entity75 told police that the initiation process went against everything that the drum major believed in			1
@entity11 did n't want to go through with it , but decided he had to in order to earn respect , @entity75 told police			0
" if you want to be somebody you have to do it , " band member @entity83 said			2
@entity75 had taken a shot of alcohol before heading down to the bus that night with @entity11			0
@entity90 , one of the female band members , was first to run through the gantlet			1
she had also earlier endured a beating in the " hot seat , " a ritual which band members said usually happened three times on different occasions before you could " cross over			1
" @entity1 's band director steps down amid hazing death controversy " you 're bent over and they just like play cadences on your back , " band member @entity103 told police about the " hot seat			1
" others described the " hot seat " beatings as more intense on other occasions			0
they said a band member would sit , head between his or her knees , be covered with a blanket to make it impossible to see , and then be beaten with drumsticks or bass drum mallets for a few minutes			1
upperclassmen in charge of organizing the ritual are normally packed into the back of the bus , making that the most brutal part of the gantlet , band members said			1
the older members instructed others not to hit @entity90 near the kidneys during the gantlet , because she suffered from medical problems			1
@entity90 said she was " basically unconscious " after the routine			0
as she sat in the back of the bus recovering , it was time for @entity75 to face the group			0
" it was a lot of people			0
it was really dark on the bus , " @entity75 told police			0
" it had to be at least maybe like 15 people			0
" @entity75 began the process , as others had , by taking off his shirt in preparation for the ritual			2
he said that as he struggled to get past the band members , he was slapped with open hands , beaten with straps and a comb , and kicked			1
he then stayed at the back of the bus , trying to regain his composure and breathing after being winded			2
when he walked back to the front of the bus , before vomiting in the parking lot , his fellow band members hollered and clapped in celebration -- a signal that he had truly completed the initiation			1
then , it was time for @entity11 , who as a drum major was subject to a bit more pummeling , some fellow band members said			1
since drum majors were considered to be the police of the band , it was n't surprising if someone snuck in a shot while they had a chance			2
band member @entity174 said that @entity11 was prepped before his run , hit in the chest before he ran the gantlet			2
one band member described @entity11 as looking anxious right before the initiation			2
@entity180 said right before @entity11 made his way through the crowd , someone shouted to " send the n * * * * r through			0
" as he made his way past each member , he was hit and punched			0
some people tried to help push him through , while at least one girl tried to hold him back , the way a linebacker would , to make the gantlet more difficult , band members said			1
at least one person tried to climb over several seats to get another shot at him			0
" when that person gets to you , i mean , you can choose to do whatever you want , " @entity180 said			0
band member @entity83 said he was trying to shout words of encouragement as the drum major made his way through punches			1
" i was just yelling , ' go ! come on , man , you can do it , ' " he said			0
at one point @entity11 fell down into one of the seats			0
one band member was " holding into the rails and kind of just jumping up and down " while @entity11 was lying in that seat , according to the documents			2
someone also grabbed him in a bear hug before @entity11 pushed through and made his way to about two feet from the end of the bus			0
" i see people are kicking him , " band member @entity220 told police			2
" so i grab him to try and keep everybody off of him			0
i put my body around his body			0
" when @entity11 finished the ritual , @entity220 sat him down on the floor of the bus			0
he asked for some water , and @entity220 gave him a @entity231			0
he seemed fine at that moment , right after the ritual , @entity220 said			0
after all three members had passed the initiation , many of the band members got off the bus and headed back toward the hotel			1
that 's when @entity11 started to panic , @entity220 said			0
" he was having trouble breathing ... and like he could n't see but his eyes were open , " @entity220 said			1
champion passed out and @entity220 said he checked for a pulse			2
the drum major still had a pulse and was still breathing , so @entity220 went upstairs to get someone else to help			1
soon after he left , @entity220 got a call that @entity11 was no longer breathing			0
band member @entity248 told police that around that time , he heard that after senior band members found out @entity11 was not moving , they panicked			1
" the upperclassmen that initiated the hazing went around the hotel asking for alcohol to rub down ( @entity11 's ) body - take off fingerprints , " he said he was told			1
a few band members began doing cpr on the drum major			1
" they was calling his name and ( champion ) was n't saying anything , " band member @entity260 said			2
as @entity260 did @entity258 , others went into the hotel to look for an automated electronic defibrillator			0
" he started vomiting when i was giving chest compressions , " @entity260 said			0
paramedics showed up soon after , took over compressions and rushed @entity11 to the hospital			0
many of the students said that late that night they began receiving calls or texts that @entity11 had died			0
they frantically struggled to figure out exactly what had happened			0
almost all of the band members said they never had any intention of injuring champion or swore they had n't directly taken part in the beating			1
last of 11 charged with felony hazing in @entity1 case turns herself in four students were expelled from the school , and another 30 were dismissed from the band soon after @entity11 's death			1
a law enforcement investigation resulted in charges being brought against 13 people			0
eleven individuals each face one count of third - degree felony hazing resulting in death			1
each is also accused of two counts of first - degree misdemeanor hazing			2
state law provides a prison term of up to six years for those facing the more serious charges			0
two people each face a single count of misdemeanor first - degree hazing			2
sentences in such cases typically call for up to a year in jail			0
@entity1 said it has taken steps to eradicate the problem , and after @entity11 died the university 's board of trustees approved an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate hazing allegations .			1
