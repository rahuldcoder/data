@entity0 -- in a meeting rife with angry and emotional exchanges , the @entity2 on thursday approved a new ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons			1
the measure now goes to the full @entity2 for consideration as part of a package of gun measures prompted by a @entity14 school massacre last december that killed 20 first graders			1
however , the proposed ban has little chance of becoming law due to fierce opposition by the @entity20 and a certain @entity22 filibuster			1
even supporters acknowledged the difficulty ahead in passing an updated version of a similar ban that became law in 1994 and expired without congressional re-authorization a decade letter			2
@entity31 sen. @entity30 of @entity32 said he doubted whether the new prohibition could get the 60 votes needed for passage			0
instead , @entity30 called for breaking off a provision that would limit ammunition magazines to 10 rounds , saying he believed it could win @entity2 approval as a separate measure			1
sponsored by sen. @entity42 , @entity43 , the proposed ban won approval from the @entity2 on a party - line vote with 10 democrats supporting it and eight @entity22 opposed			1
the panel previously approved other proposals that would expand background checks on all gun sales and enact tougher laws against firearms trafficking and straw purchases			2
analysts believe those have a better chance of clearing the @entity2			1
heated debate by committee members on thursday showed the partisan divide over gun legislation , as well as the challenge supporters face in getting any substantive measures through @entity63			1
at one point , @entity42 and chairman @entity64 , @entity65 , reacted sharply to remarks by freshman sen. @entity68 , @entity69 , about the need for the committee to legislate based on facts and the @entity73 instead of passion over the gun issue ignited by the @entity76 , @entity14 , killings			2
when @entity68 asked if @entity42 believed the @entity78 also could be limited in the same way he contended the proposed ban would limit the @entity81 right to bear arms , she shot back : " i 'm not a sixth grader			2
" noting her 20 years on the committee and experience as mayor of @entity87 , she said in a rising voice how she had seen " bodies that have been shot with these weapons , " adding that the schoolchildren killed in @entity76 " were dismembered " by the bullets			2
" i 've studied the @entity73 myself			0
i am reasonably well - educated and i thank you for the lecture , " she continued , noting her bill exempts 2,271 weapons from the ban			1
" is n't that enough for the people in the @entity100 ? do they need a bazooka ? do they need other high - powered weapons that military people use to kill in close combat ? i do n't think so , " she said			1
she concluded by telling @entity68 that " i come from a different place than you do			0
i ask you to respect my views			0
" @entity68 and other republicans on the committee contended that @entity42 's proposal would prevent law - abiding gun owners from possessing weapons of choice , while criminals would still be able to get them to leave people unable to properly defend themselves			1
" why would you deny for defensive purposes otherwise law - abiding citizens to be able to use an equivalent firepower to defend themselves ? " argued sen. @entity121 , @entity69			2
" it 's not much satisfaction to say that criminals are gon na have access to the whole range of weapons that they will have access to because they do n't care about the laws that are passed			2
and we 're gon na give the @entity100 citizen a pea shooter to defend themselves with			0
" president @entity138 called for the legislative steps in response to the massacre in @entity76 by a lone gunman armed with an assault weapon that jolted the nation			1
the @entity2 panel passed versions of much of the package @entity138 proposed , but @entity22 made their opposition clear			1
" now the full @entity2 and the @entity150 need to vote on this bill , as well as the measures advanced in the past week , " @entity138 said in a statement on thursday			1
one measure by @entity31 sen. @entity154 of @entity155 would mandate background checks for all gun sales , including private transactions			0
it would also require increased cooperation by states with the @entity163 's @entity162 ( @entity162 ) and would prohibit people deemed by the courts as unfit to own guns from obtaining them			0
@entity121 said thursday that he would propose amendments to @entity154 's bill on the @entity2 floor , and he also mentioned that a bipartisan substitute to the measure could be offered			2
the @entity20 has said increased checks are nothing more than an attempt to create a national gun registry , a move the group vehemently opposes			1
@entity64 challenged such assertions on thursday , saying in a toughly worded final statement that opponents of gun legislation should stop spreading false information about the panel 's proposals			0
" second amendment rights are not at risk , " he said			0
" let 's not put an issue out here that 's not out here			0
but lives are at risk			0
" reflecting on his decades on the panel , @entity64 called for members of both parties to " come together to become a safer and more secure society			0
" " we do not need false charges about gun registries and gun registration to scare people when no such thing is being proposed or will be proposed , " he said			0
another measure approved by the panel earlier this week would establish a framework for the @entity206 to set safety guidelines aimed at protecting schools from gun violence			0
@entity1 's @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
