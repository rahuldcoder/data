-- @entity1 has clearly kicked up a hornet 's nest with its downright insulting cover headlined " @entity5 , " and coupled with the blurb , " it 's nearly impossible to fire a bad teacher			1
some tech millionaires may have found a way to change that			0
" the cover is a slap in the face to every teacher who has dedicated his or her life to bettering the lives of children			2
right now , we should be lifting up and championing educators			2
the last thing we should be doing is discouraging or dampening the enthusiasm of a new generation			1
worse , the @entity1 story gives sloppy credence to the well - funded , well - orchestrated attacks from a small cadre of wealthy business interests , many of whom have never even set foot in a classroom			1
these attacks on public education , educators and neighborhood schools have unfortunately become the norm			1
it 's gone too far			2
due process policies such as tenure are put in place to protect good teachers from being fired without cause			1
they are n't there to protect " bad " teachers			1
in fact , research from economist @entity50 suggests removing tenure might worsen educational outcomes because it would eliminate one of the major attractions to the profession			1
and since one of the biggest challenges in public education these days is teacher retention and recruitment , abolishing tenure could be incredibly harmful			1
recently , democrats for @entity64 was formed to show that @entity63 remain united around a core set of principles			0
as a co-chair , i 've seen how in just two months after officially launching , scores of elected officials , activists and party leaders in all 50 states have signed up to join our organization as supporters			0
they understand it 's time we collectively push back against efforts to undermine our schools , our teachers and the children themselves			1
@entity83 conducted a poll with @entity85 , a @entity86 - based firm that worked on president @entity88 's historic 2008 election and 2012 re-election			1
the poll shows voters support public education in resoundingly large numbers			1
roughly two thirds of @entity95 agree with traditionally @entity63 positions when it comes to education			1
i 've seen an awful lot of polling through the years			0
and there is n't a profession out there that would n't love to have the kind of favorability numbers enjoyed by local public schools and teachers in this survey			1
moreover , any campaign manager would give his or her eye teeth for their candidate to have these results and engender these warm feelings among the masses			0
contrary to what some naysayers -- and magazine covers -- continue to hawk , the @entity95 people are proud of their public schools			1
and they 're proud of their teachers , too			2
overall , 82 % of voters able to rate their local teachers believe them to be excellent , very good or good			2
so , even though we 've seen lawsuits from @entity131 to @entity134 scapegoating " bad teachers , " the divisive views espoused by @entity127 and @entity128 simply are n't rooted in public opinion			1
when presented with four broad reasons as to why public schools are n't performing better , almost no one puts the blame on " bad teachers			1
" instead , 40 % cite a lack of parental involvement / support			0
another 29 % name inadequate funding and resources for public schools			1
and 18 % peg it on the effects of poverty , hardships and problems kids bring to school			0
only a mere 3 % uttered the words " bad teachers " -- including 4 % of @entity154 and 3 % of conservatives			1
the truth is that voters support their teachers , who are the furthest thing from " rotten apples			2
" rock - solid majorities ( 61 % ) back additional funding for public schools , including 79 % of @entity63 and 57 % of independents			1
in fact , even 45 % of @entity154 hold this belief			0
it 's no surprise that voters of all stripes are fed up with @entity154 cuts to education across the country hurting children and neighborhood schools			2
in 2010 , a slew of obstructionist governors swept into statehouses on the @entity179 wave			0
over the past four years , in @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and other states , we 've seen -- and felt -- drastic cuts in funding for public education			2
unfortunately , this year , far too many @entity63 have largely avoided this issue out of a mistaken fear that running on a pro-public education platform would be a far too risky topic for their campaigns			0
turns out these @entity63 are just plain wrong			0
they 're missing a golden opportunity to highlight this important issue			0
the good news is that there is still time over this final week of the campaign season			0
throughout the country , there are opportunities to shine a lantern on these dramatic cuts , ehether it 's gov. @entity208 slicing education funding by $ 1 billion in @entity183 or gov. @entity210 , who made the biggest cuts to education in @entity181 's history			2
in @entity184 , gov. @entity214 cut education by more than $ 1 billion			0
in @entity186 , gov. @entity216 proposed cuts to public school funding by 4 % , or about $ 470 per student			0
there is no doubt that @entity95 are feeling this sting in their public schools			1
in @entity227 , sen. @entity225 , a @entity226 , has impressively and smartly utilized education as a main issue in her campaign			0
she 's hammered her @entity154 challenger for gutting education when he was the @entity154 ringleader in the @entity233			0
in fact , @entity225 used the exact term " gutting education " four times as a cudgel in a recent debate			0
and that 's because she knows this is an issue that resonates with voters and is keenly felt on the ground in a tangible way			0
over the years , i 've worked for and alongside the @entity247 and @entity248			0
that 's because i am proud of our public school teachers -- including my niece who teaches down in @entity253 -- just as i am proud of our nation 's education system			1
those who slam public education and educators are simply out - of - touch			2
and the numbers bear this out			0
the information from this new @entity83 survey could and should be used as a roadmap for those who want to speak out loud and clear in support of neighborhood schools and public education			2
not only for the stretch run of the 2014 campaign trail , but beyond .			0

@entity1 's cover story about bad teachers is demeaning to educators
@entity275 : research shows that removing tenure might worsen educational outcomes
she says @entity95 are proud of their public schools and teachers , according to poll
@entity275 : the last thing we should do is discourage enthusiasm of a new generation
