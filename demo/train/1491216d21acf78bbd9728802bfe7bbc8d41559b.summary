@entity1 , @entity0 -- dr. @entity3 is the coordinator of @entity4 , the @entity5 , a network of around 50 experts in renewable energies and sustainability			1
@entity3 , co-founder and coordinator of @entity4 , a network that promotes renewable energies when he retired from his research into particle physics in 2001 , @entity13 was concerned that the planet 's impending energy crisis was not being solved			1
" i think it is insane to organize collective suicide and to participate in that , " he told @entity2			0
" the fossil fuel system and our economy are doing that right now			0
we can not survive in this way			0
" so rather than go fishing or head to the golf course , @entity13 decided to seek a solution			2
" i thought , ' are we so stupid ? i 'll see what options nature is giving us			0
' " so in 2003 , @entity13 co-founded @entity4			1
the network , which has members from six @entity33 and ten @entity35 and @entity36 countries , encourages countries to work together to harness the power of the sun to bring clean energy to the world -- and they think they 've found a way to do it			1
@entity4 says that we could meet the entire world 's energy needs by covering a fraction of the world 's deserts -- just 0.5 percent -- with concentrated solar power plants			1
it is now working with governments and businesses to make this dream a reality			0
@entity13 is hopeful that soon the world will embrace solar power as the leading source of energy			1
" my guess is that solar energy will be 40 to 70 percent of the total energy consumption , 30 to 60 years from now , " he said			2
as part of his mission , @entity13 sees solar power as a tool to help poorer countries in @entity36			1
" they would develop a new source of income if they could sell clean electricity to @entity33 , " he told @entity2			2
" for @entity33 this would be one of the cheapest sources of clean electricity			2
it 's a win - win situation between the two			0
" and he does n't sound like a quiet retirement will tempt him away from @entity4 any time soon			0
" i find it challenging and rewarding to work out ways into the future which are not harmful to us , " he said			0
" that 's why i 'm doing this and that 's why i 'm enjoying it			0
" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... what do you think of @entity3 's work ? do you think we could power the @entity91 with solar energy ? tell us in the forum -- or read others ' views on the future of energy			1
