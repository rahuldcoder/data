@entity0 -- politicians in both parties might have seriously miscalculated			2
the election returns are n't in yet , so we ca n't know for sure			2
still , if trends continue , this could turn out to be a bad year for fear			1
when this election season started several months ago , @entity9 and @entity10 thought they 'd scare up a few votes by accusing their opponents of being , let 's see , soft on the border , determined to take away women 's reproductive rights , simpatico with tea party extremists , incapable of protecting @entity19 from terrorists or deadly viruses , eager to impeach the president , or even intent on dragging us back to one of our country 's darkest chapters by bringing back lynching			1
you think i 'm exaggerating ? perhaps a little , but not much			0
have you taken a look at the campaign fliers in your mailbox ? be warned			2
this october , every day felt like @entity35			1
whether it was coming from @entity9 or @entity10 , the message was pretty much the same : " @entity37 " or in the long form , it went like this : " you 're in danger ! " and candidate @entity43 is going to make you even less safe and more vulnerable			1
you need to protect yourself and your family , and vote against candidate xyz			0
and hey , look , i 'm on the ballot , too			0
so why not vote for me as a safer alternative ? " this is n't your usual surge of negative campaigning , where candidates sling mud and attack one another 's character , honesty or integrity			1
americans are used to that			0
in fact , hopefully , they 're largely immune to it by now			0
what was on display in many of this year 's @entity69 races was the politics of fear , where politicians are so desperate to get elected or re-elected that they use inflammatory commercials and wild accusations to terrify the same group of voters who they should be trying to inspire with a hopeful and confident message			1
when will they learn that positive messages are always stronger than negative ones ? this lesson was not lost on two of the most successful politicians in the last half of the 20th century : @entity85 and @entity86			0
both men were happy warriors whose hopeful messages triumphed over the doom and gloom peddled by their opponents			0
the good news is that , this year , it does n't seem as if this strategy have worked out very well for the fear mongers			1
look at the polls in races where specific candidates have tried to scare voters away from their opponents : -- fear is on the run in @entity101 , where a third party group 's campaign mailer in support of @entity10 sen. @entity106 , which was clearly aimed at african - americans , warned that electing @entity9 challenger @entity109 would set the stage for the immediate impeachment of president @entity112			1
the faded image in the background : a lynching			0
so if @entity106 is n't re-elected , the nation 's first @entity117 - @entity19 president is headed for a political lynching ? that 's shameful but not exactly subtle			1
in the same contest , the @entity121 released a radio ad slamming @entity109 for his support for @entity125 " that caused the shooting death of @entity127			0
" so @entity109 somehow contributed to the 2012 death of @entity127 ? outrageous			0
-- fear is on the run in @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 where @entity9 want to scare voters into thinking that @entity136 and @entity137 -- or perhaps even @entity139 militants infected with @entity137 -- are salsa dancing across a porous @entity19 - @entity142 border			1
there 's no evidence that either @entity136 or @entity137 is coming across the border , and the @entity145 has called the idea " categorically false			1
" consequently , that line of attack is n't gaining any traction in key races in border states			2
even in those races where republicans are favored , the scare tactics do n't seem to winning over independent voters who would n't normally support the @entity9			1
why does n't the @entity9 just be honest and go back to what @entity9 elected officials in the @entity157 have always portrayed as the real threat : invading hordes of @entity142 who steal the worst and dirtiest jobs ? maybe @entity9 are the ones who are afraid			2
maybe they 're concerned that , if they said this , they would sound racist			0
-- and , most of all , fear is on the run in @entity169 , where @entity9 @entity170 maintains a narrow lead over @entity10 sen. @entity172 in most polls			1
technically , the race is a toss - up , but given that @entity172 had the money and name recognition that comes with being the incumbent , it 's no wonder that @entity10 are bracing for a defeat			1
@entity172 bet all his marbles on the female vote , but then he proceeded to insult that constituency by overplaying his hand			0
forgetting that women care about issues such as the economy and terrorism as much as men do , @entity172 pushed the issue of abortion rights to the point where the senator has been mockingly dubbed : " @entity194			0
" this was not a good re-election strategy for @entity172 , but it has turned out to be good for the @entity170 campaign			0
even with all this election year negativity , there is a positive side			0
one group of voters after another -- from african - americans to pro-border security conservatives to women -- have , whether they realize it or not , been given a valuable gift			2
on tuesday , they have the opportunity to shrug off the soundbites , declare their independence from the politics of fear and send a message of their own			2
from this point on , they need to insist upon something that elected officials do n't always give voters : respect .			2

@entity224 : seeing political ads may be the scariest part of @entity35 this year
he says candidates in both parties are *resorting* to politics of fear to turn out voters
@entity224 : some have warned , with no evidence , of *immigrants* with @entity137 and @entity139 ties
he says efforts to frighten women into voting for @entity10 in @entity169 do n't seem to work
