@entity0 checks her baby 's forehead over and over again			1
is he hot ? does he have a rash ? is his nose still runny ? her son has been sick before , but this time it 's different : last week @entity9 was at a @entity11 clinic with a woman who had the measles , which spreads easily from person to person			1
now he 's showing signs of the virus , such as runny nose and cough and fatigue			1
at 10 months old , @entity9 is too young to get vaccinated and would be especially vulnerable to serious complications of measles , such as deafness and brain damage or even death			1
but his parents have an even bigger worry			2
if @entity9 does have the measles , he could give it to his 3 - year - old sister , @entity30 , who has leukemia			1
so far @entity30 is feeling fine , but her parents know that with her immune system wiped out by chemotherapy she 's even more vulnerable than her brother to complications			2
" my biggest fear is that i 'll lose my child , or that she 'll become deaf , " @entity0 said			2
" my family has been through enough with cancer			2
i do n't want her to go through anything else			2
" measles cases in @entity44 soar according to @entity51 health officials , the woman at the clinic who put the @entity48 children in danger was herself infected by members of a family that does n't vaccinate and got measles during a visit to @entity57 , where the outbreak began more than a month ago			1
this week , @entity30 and @entity9 's father , dr. @entity59 , wrote a blog post in which he expressed his feelings to this family			2
" towards you , unvaccinating parent , i feel anger and frustration at your choices , " wrote @entity0 , a pediatrician			2
" why would you knowingly expose anyone to your sick unvaccinated child after recently visiting @entity57 ? that was a boneheaded move			2
" " your poor choices do n't just affect your child , " he continued			0
" they affect my family and many more like us			0
i am upset and just a little bit scared			0
" jacks signed the post " @entity82			0
" father asks school district to ban unvaccinated children the @entity48 family asked a @entity1 crew not to enter their home or meet with @entity9			1
out of an abundance of caution we also chose not to meet with @entity30 or with @entity59 , who has limited immunity to measles			0
we spoke to @entity0 in person because blood tests show she has complete immunity to measles			0
' no unvaccinated people around my kids ' the @entity101 do n't know the identity of the vaccine refusers who put their children in danger , but @entity0 said she knows what she would say to them if she ever met them			1
" your children do n't live in a little bubble			1
they live in a big bubble and my children live inside that big bubble with your children , " she said			1
" if you do n't want to vaccinate your children , fine , but do n't take them to @entity57			1
" but dr. @entity116 said it 's the @entity48 family who should keep themselves at home , not him			0
@entity116 , an @entity51 cardiologist , refuses to vaccinate his two young sons			1
he said the family that did n't vaccinate and endangered the @entity48 children did nothing wrong			1
" it 's not my responsibility to inject my child with chemicals in order for [ a child like @entity30 ] to be supposedly healthy , " he said			0
" as far as i 'm concerned , it 's very likely that her leukemia is from vaccinations in the first place			1
" " i 'm not going to sacrifice the well - being of my child			0
my child is pure , " he added			0
" it 's not my responsibility to be protecting their child			0
" @entity1 asked @entity116 if he could live with himself if his unvaccinated child got another child gravely ill. " i could live with myself easily , " he said			0
" it 's an unfortunate thing that people die , but people die			0
i 'm not going to put my child at risk to save another child			1
" he blamed the @entity48 family for taking @entity30 to the clinic for care			0
" if a child is so vulnerable like that , they should n't be going out into society , " he said			0
@entity0 said she hopes vaccine refusers get educated and change their minds			0
in the meantime , she prays that her daughter recovers from leukemia and that both her children avoid getting measles .			1

@entity163 is too young to be vaccinated ; his sister has leukemia
@entity166 cases that have spread to @entity51 have put the children at risk
