@entity0 certainly means business when she steps onto a tennis court			1
whatever the situation , winning or losing , there is no let - up			0
a big serve , blistering ground strokes , winning points often greeted with a clenched fist and shrieks of exultation			0
opponents are not so much beaten as bludgeoned into submission -- although at the handshake @entity0 is never less than courteous and sporting , the intensity replaced by a smile			1
it 's a winning formula that has brought the 24 - year - old @entity19 three grand slam titles and made her the highest - paid sportswoman in the world , with an eight - year @entity24 deal worth a reported $ 70 million			1
@entity0 : serving social media or backhanded marketing ? she can return to the top of the world rankings by winning saturday 's @entity30 final , capping a remarkable comeback after injuries almost ended her career			1
with such a hunger for success , it 's no surprise that @entity0 pays great attention to every aspect of her performance -- and that extends to her on - court appearance and apparel			1
" when you look good , you feel good , " she told @entity44			0
" confidence with what you 're wearing is very important			0
if you feel good , you will always perform your best without worrying about anything			0
" a shrewd businesswoman off the court , @entity0 took matters into her own hands with her own range of clothing and footwear , which has developed into a successful commercial venture			1
the @entity58 is made in collaboration with her sportswear sponsors and leading fashion house @entity61			1
first launched at the @entity30 two years ago , the design brief is to come up with a separate outfit for each grand slam			1
this year 's offering in @entity66 is called " @entity67			0
" @entity0 has already made a big statement by beating @entity69 , her conqueror in last year 's @entity71 final , to set up a title clash with @entity73			1
maybe , just maybe , the outfit played its part			0
the @entity77 handout from @entity24 would certainly have us believe it			0
" the carefully - constructed vents with mesh inlays along the bodice reflect the breathable gills of a powerful shark or super-charged race car and help keep @entity0 cool and ready to attack			2
contrast color in the mesh becomes a stealth weapon to distract the opponent			0
" whatever the hype , a great deal of work goes into the final product , with the process starting up to 18 months before it is unveiled and made available to the general public			0
@entity0 is intimately involved in the design process of the outfit to which she lends her name , coming up with sketches and design ideas			2
" it 's exciting to see my collections in the store , " she said			0
" what 's even more thrilling is to see women wearing and loving the product			2
if i can create something that allows a woman to feel better -- that is the true reward			0
" several young female players on the @entity111 sport her collection in tournament play , including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
in fact , her reputation for fashion sense is already legendary among the game 's elite			2
when @entity126 was questioned at the @entity30 about the design of his training top , the world no. 2 owned up			1
" i 'm not @entity0 , " the @entity129 told reporters			2
" @entity0 is doing it			2
i just say , ' i like , i do n't like ! ' " @entity133 , the president of major @entity135 retailer @entity134 , told @entity44 that the clothing range was well thought out			0
" it 's the perfect combination of fashion and function			2
@entity0 's dress has become consistently more marketable over the last few years , " he said			1
but she faces as much competition off the court as on it			0
especially among the women , the leading tennis players are battling for world domination in the fashion stakes			1
the @entity150 sisters @entity151 and @entity152 have their own ranges , while recently - deposed no. 1 @entity154 has paired with @entity156 designer @entity155 to produce eye - catching outfits			0
@entity133 said his outlets see a spike during the grand slams as customers want to purchase the latest ranges , but noted that the @entity0 - led @entity24 offering is " the clear leader in women 's tennis apparel			1
" @entity0 has history in setting fashion trends -- the diamond - encrusted ' @entity172 " she wore on the way to winning the 2006 @entity171 was widely acclaimed			1
at the time , @entity24 did not market the outfit for wider distribution , but the company is determined to avoid a repeat and capitalize on @entity0 's global appeal			1
her collaboration with @entity61 has extended to an exclusive range of women 's fashion clothing and a series of glitzy publicity launches			1
it undoubtedly helps that @entity0 -- at 1.88 meters ( six foot two inches ) -- has the natural height of a supermodel and is the perfect showcase for her creations			2
" since i was young , the artistic expression that fashion embodies has inspired me , " @entity0 said			1
" it 's a way to communicate oneself			0
" when @entity0 does decide to hang up her rackets , it is fair to assume that she will utilize her flair for design and business savvy to extend her fashion empire			1
she would follow legendary style names such as 1930s tennis icons @entity201 and @entity203 , while of the more recently retired stars @entity204 has a new collection set to hit the stores			2
for now , tennis takes precedence , and success in the 2012 season is a priority			0
" i 'm focused on going out every day and doing my best , " @entity0 said			2
of that there is no doubt .			0
