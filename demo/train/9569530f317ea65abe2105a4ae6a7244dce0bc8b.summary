-- a cancerous tumor in 13 - year - old @entity4 's chest has shrunk significantly since he was ordered by a court last month to resume chemotherapy treatment , a family spokesman said			1
@entity4 , 13 , was headed for a clinic in @entity8 until an arrest warrant was issued for his mom			1
but the @entity4 family attributes much of his progress to the complementary use of vitamins and minerals to boost his immune system , @entity11 said			2
" the family is doing it on their own , with the doctor 's knowledge , " @entity11 said			1
" everybody is pleased that the tumor is shrinking , of course			0
the goal is to get rid of the cancer , but they 'd rather be doing it without the chemo			1
" @entity4 's case made national headlines last month when he and his mother , @entity34 , fled @entity35 , @entity36 , for @entity8 to seek alternative cancer care despite a court order that he undergo chemotherapy			1
they eventually returned after an arrest warrant was issued for @entity42			0
but had they made it to their destination -- the @entity46 in @entity47 , according to @entity11 -- they would have joined the ranks of an estimated hundreds of other cancer patients who head south of the border each year for cancer care			2
" their intentions started long ago with @entity34			0
she 's been involved in natural healing for many years now			1
she believes the world was created with everything needed to sustain and heal life , " @entity11 said			0
despite controversial origins and consistent bad press in the @entity61 , @entity47 's border clinics continue to attract people like the @entity63 , who are in search of more holistic approaches to cancer treatment			1
because little data exist on how many clinics are operating , it 's unclear how many @entity61 cancer patients visit @entity8 each year , said @entity71 , a patient advocate who runs the web site , http://www.quackwatch.com /			1
" if they answered , you could not be sure they were telling the truth			0
they might have an incentive to raise the number , " he said in an e-mail			0
" to make matters more complicated , many of the ' cancer ' clinics also see people who do n't have cancer			1
" the concept of complementary and alternative cancer treatment has slowly been gaining acceptance for more than a decade in the @entity61 , with the creation of entities including the @entity92 's @entity91			1
" clinicians and researchers have realized that it 's important to conduct methodologically sound studies to help guide patients to understand what 's safe and what 's effective , " said dr. @entity93 , medical director of health content for the @entity95			2
but no one recommends that alternative treatment be used to replace conventional care , such as chemotherapy or radiation , he said			1
" the important thing to remember is there is no recommended alternative to conventional treatment , and the reason is because if it worked , it would become conventional , " he said			1
as far as @entity47 's border clinics are concerned , the @entity95 cautions that " methods promoted in @entity8 border clinics are not consistent with scientific understanding " of cancer and its treatment			1
" although these clinics often claim great success in advertisements and books , they have not published convincing evidence in medical journals to support those claims , " the @entity95 says in a section on its web site called @entity121			2
" patients traveling to the @entity47 area for treatment appear to be subjecting themselves to costly and potentially hazardous regimens , especially if they postpone standard medical care			1
" loose regulatory standards in @entity8 allow @entity47 's clinics to thrive , many offering expensive treatment in luxurious , spa - like settings , complete with fresh meals , exercise classes and emotional and spiritual counseling			1
many herbs and dietary supplements used in border clinics are not considered dangerous ; they just have not been put through the rigorous clinical trials required for the @entity146 to approve them for use as cancer treatments			1
others , like the antioxidants carotene , lycopene and vitamins @entity154 , have produced inconsistent results in large - scale trials and are still being researched			0
still others , like laetrile , a chemical compound whose active ingredient is cyanide , can be dangerous , the @entity92 says			0
but many patients say they are attracted by the warm , caring relationship between patient and clinic staff			0
" they do n't just see the disease			0
they see the person behind the disease and know how to care for them in every way , " says @entity167 , who claims she has been cancer - free for 17 years			2
when she was 11 years old , her oncologist told her family she had six months to live and recommended chemotherapy and radiation to battle her @entity179 's lymphoma			1
instead of undergoing the debilitating treatments , she went to the @entity181 in @entity47 , where she received low doses of chemotherapy along with intravenous vitamins			1
the @entity95 says there is no scientific evidence that low doses of chemotherapy or large doses of supplements are effective against cancer			2
but @entity167 believes the small doses of chemo attacked cancerous cells without destroying her immune system while the vitamins boosted her immunity			2
" i remember thinking if they 'd given me the high doses of chemo i would n't have made it			2
even the low doses made me so incredibly sick			0
i 'd be getting up like every 15 minutes , puking in the middle of the night , " @entity167 said			0
like @entity4 , @entity167 was entangled in a court battle over her family 's decision			2
however , a judge allowed her to continue treatment in @entity8 , while last month a judge ordered @entity4 to undergo chemotherapy			1
@entity167 's case was ultimately dismissed after doctors from the @entity212 in @entity213 declined to evaluate her progress on the grounds that they felt she was receiving " inadequate treatment , " according to court documents			2
four months after her diagnosis in 1991 , she says , she was cancer - free , and has remained so			0
dr. @entity220 , @entity181 of @entity222 's head physician and the son of its founder , says @entity8 's " open - mindedness " toward alternative therapies is related to the socioeconomic standing of most of its citizens			1
" @entity8 authorities are much more open to natural therapies because most @entity8 live under the line of poverty so they would not have access to conventional medicine , " he said			1
" i do n't know if that 's for benefit of our patients or not , but we have this open - mindedness because we have to do something to help our people			0
" like many border clinics , @entity220 says his center takes an integrative approach , combining conventional treatment , such as chemotherapy and radiation , with alternative methods to create individualized regimens that focus on healing the entire body with fewer debilitating , long - term side effects			1
not everyone leaves @entity47 's clinics happy			2
several articles on www.quackwatch.com and its sister sites contain negative testimonials from people who say they sought alternative treatment , mostly laetrile , for parents or a loved one only to have them die of cyanide poisoning a few weeks later			2
such cautionary tales did n't stop @entity264 from following the example of her grandfather by going to @entity47 to receive the @entity268 treatment , an intravenous serum that its makers say consists of vitamins , minerals and amino acids			0
during her first monthlong visit , @entity264 paid about $ 15,000 for surgery to remove her tumors , 20 days of worth of the dosage and two meals a day , plus lodging expenses across the border in @entity281 , @entity282			0
but @entity264 says it was worth every penny			0
i 've never had any ill side effects , and i have learned so much about nutrition and how to maintain my health , " she said in a telephone interview from her home in @entity287 , @entity288			0
@entity264 says she has not seen a doctor in the @entity61 since			0
she says she returns to @entity293 about every six months for six days at a time to receive " booster treatments " for about $ 1,200 a visit			0
" it 's a very well - rounded program			0
you do n't just go there and let somebody give you something and then walk out and forget about it			0
you take responsibility from that day forward to do the right thing to keep your health in order			0

tumors have shrunk in teen who was ordered to resume chemotherapy
family credits alternative treatments he 's getting in addition to chemo

expert : if alternative therapies really cured cancer , they 'd be standard treatment
