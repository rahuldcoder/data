-- looking to get to @entity1 without blowing your son 's college fund ? want to experience the islands but not sure when to go ? here 's how to avoid costly and exhausting mistakes during your @entity9 vacation			1
do n't travel to @entity1 during school holidays			1
tourists crowd @entity1 's stunning beaches in summer and winter			1
during school holidays , flight and hotel rates are off the charts -- between @entity18 and @entity19 , condos and vacation rentals can run three times as much as rates in early december			1
do visit @entity1 in the off - season			1
hands down the best values on visiting @entity1 can be found in may and october			1
with prices reasonably low and the weather at its peak -- not too hot , not too rainy -- take advantage of the perks of off - season travel to jet off to the islands			1
current spring and fall flight deals from the @entity37 are half of july rates			0
additionally , hotels and condos generally slash their prices off - season , rewarding visitors with oceanfront accommodations that typically sell out in peak months			1
travel snapshots : @entity1 do n't blow your whole budget on a luxury resort			1
while staying in a luxurious @entity9 resort where birds flutter through the open - air lobby and fresh papaya is served at the swim - up bar is nice , it is likely to cost between $ 400 - $ 600 a night in high season			2
instead , fork over the cash for a lomilomi massage and gourmet seafood dinner , and make your own poolside @entity58 at a rental condo			1
do consider staying in a condo			2
repeat visitors know to rent a condo			2
kitchens , ample square footage , washing machines and privacy afford travelers a more authentic ( and often less costly ) vacation experience			0
it 's common for numerous companies to manage individual units in the same complex , meaning one property may be decked out by a globetrotting interior decorator , while another may be awash in wicker			0
be sure to see photos of the particular condo you 're interested in and get specifics on the number and configuration of beds			2
do n't try to see everything			0
while each island has its own personality , it is too expensive ( and exhausting ) to island - hop the entire archipelago on one vacation			1
inter-island flights generally run between $ 70 - $ 140 each way and most travel to @entity95 , so if you want to get from @entity97 to the @entity98 , you might have to stop in @entity99 and basically pay the equivalent of two inter-island flights each way			2
do stick to one or two islands			0
each region on each island has its own flavor			2
the north and east sides of the islands are more tropical , while the south and west regions offer sunnier skies and a more arid landscape			0
instead of island hopping , break your trip up by staying in a plush hotel within walking distance of a sunny south shore beach and then cozy up in a rental house near the more tropical ( read : rainy ) north shore			1
if you want to island - hop on the cheap , @entity122 offers ferry service to @entity125 and @entity126			1
do n't fall for the luau			0
most luaus are overpriced and far from the real thing ( usually family events on a beach for a first birthday )			0
while they seem like an authentic experience , you can actually piece together the highlights of a luau yourself			0
grab a picnic of poke , lomi lomi , fresh pineapple , and poi from a local market			0
in the evenings at most malls on @entity97 and @entity122 , and at sunset at @entity148 , you can watch free hula shows featuring some of @entity1 's best dancers			1
do splurge on an adventure			0
whether you fancy diving deep into the sea , soaring over waterfalls on a helicopter tour , or a kayak trip along the @entity159 , treat yourself to at least one adventure			2
be sure to book early in your trip in case of bad weather			2
and lastly , do not forget to relax on the beach			0
no need to be on a boat , or a horse , or a helicopter , or a zip line the whole time			0
save time to enjoy @entity1 's world - class beaches			1
from the shore , you can walk right out into the sea and snorkel with sea turtles , angelfish and monk seals basically for free			0
as the sun descends over the @entity178 , unwind under a coconut palm and watch the sky burst with color as surfers ride the last sunlit waves onto the white sand			0
