-- republicans and @entity2 raised serious concerns more than two years ago with the @entity5 administration about the possibility of swapping @entity8 prisoners for captured @entity10 sgt. @entity9 but said promised consultation never materialized			1
that disclosure on tuesday illuminated congressional dismay with the @entity14 over its decision to finally negotiate @entity9 's release in exchange for the transfer of five men held at @entity20 to @entity21			1
a statement by @entity14 speaker @entity23 referred to " serious questions " he and others raised in briefings that date back as far as late 2011 and in followup correspondence , and said promises of further discussions were ignored			1
" unfortunately , the questions and concerns we had were never satisfactorily answered and they remain today			0
at the time , the administration deferred further engagement because the prospects of the exchange had diminished , " @entity23 said			0
" the administration provided assurances , publicly reiterated by the @entity14 in june 2013 , that its engagement with @entity40 would resume if the prospects for an exchange became credible again , " @entity23 said			1
was @entity9 swap legal ? @entity45 chairman @entity44 said that she and the panel 's vice chair , @entity46 , a @entity49 @entity48 , were briefed on the administration 's proposal in november 2011			1
a number of other top lawmakers in the @entity14 and @entity45 also received briefings , @entity48 aides said			1
the @entity57 @entity56 said she and @entity46 wrote a classified letter to @entity59 , who was secretary of state at the time , in december of that year that was also signed by the leaders of the @entity62			0
@entity44 said another letter went to president @entity5 in january of 2012			2
" both letters registered concerns with the proposal and opposed the transfer of the detainees to @entity21 , " she said			0
the lawmakers received a " comprehensive response " from @entity71 that included " security assurances and a promise of consultation with the @entity40 , " she said			1
@entity48 aides said other lawmakers also received a response from @entity71			0
but @entity44 , like @entity23 , said she was n't aware of any further consultation until receiving a call on saturday from the administration saying that @entity9 had been released and the terror detainees were on their way to @entity21			1
" given the past briefings and concerns we had addressed , and these were from both committees and the leadership of both committees , the concerns were bipartisan , and i strongly believe that we should have been consulted , " she said			2
" i think you can see that we 're very dismayed about it , " @entity44 said			0
she said the @entity14 deputy national security adviser , @entity91 , called her to apologize for the lack of advance notice			2
angry lawmakers cited a law signed by @entity5 requiring 30 - day notice of plans to transfer prisoners from @entity20			1
@entity5 told reporters in @entity100 on tuesday that the circumstances required an immediate decision within his authority as commander in chief			0
" we have consulted with @entity40 for quite some time about the possibility we may have to execute a prisoner exchange , " @entity5 said			1
" we saw an opportunity and we were concerned about his health and had cooperation from the @entity21 and we seized that			0
it was truncated to make sure we did n't miss that opportunity			0
" but @entity44 said there " has not been even the weakest case " made that @entity9 's health required immediate action to negotiate his release , in their previous correspondence with the administration , which @entity0 reviewed but was not allowed to copy , the lawmakers asked that a number of issues be addressed			1
they included precedent for such an exchange , the impact it would have on combat troops , and the risks of the five terror detainees returning to the battlefield			0
they also wanted to know whether the administration had exhausted all other options to secure @entity9 's release before it pursued a possible exchange			2
in all discussions and the private communications about such a step , there were exchanges about possible conditions placed on the detainees -- including renouncing @entity144 and violence in the region			0
but those terms were not included in the deal			0
@entity23 said the administration 's actions and lack of consultation with @entity40 merited further review , and supported @entity155 's call for hearings			2
@entity71 wanted a tougher deal with @entity8 for @entity9			2

republicans and @entity2 raised concerns with the @entity5 administration
but they say they were ultimately ignored after getting assurances they *'d* be consulted
the @entity14 signed off on a deal to free @entity9 without notifying @entity40
*senior* lawmakers are dismayed , @entity14 may hold a hearing
