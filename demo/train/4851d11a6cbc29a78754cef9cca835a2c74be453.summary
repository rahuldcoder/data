, the ideological body that vets presidential candidates , announced its list of eight men approved to run for office			1
although i was fully qualified and campaigned assiduously within the framework of the @entity11 for four months , i ultimately was not on that list -- and the reason has led to much speculation and hearsay			0
i wish to set the record straight about our campaign and my candidacy for president of @entity2			1
our campaign began by publishing an 80 - page platform in @entity23 and @entity24 , building websites , and extensively utilizing social media			2
we also internationalized our campaign by giving interviews to media outlets and speaking at universities and gatherings throughout the world			0
it was the first @entity2 campaign to go global and the first presidential campaign ever by an expatriate			1
in a short time , our @entity35 reached over 100,000 -- largely coming from young @entity2			2
with these and other accomplishments under our belt , i went to @entity2 in mid-april to set up a campaign office			2
during my short stay in @entity2 , i learned that our campaign is popular and that its fame has become a source of concern for the @entity11 system			1
i was even told by certain officials that the campaign could lead to civic disorder , and that my own safety is a concern			1
i was advised to stop the campaign , a reference that was also strongly echoed by my political advisers			0
despite the warning , i waited until the last day of the registration on may 11 to withdraw , saving my candidacy from the @entity3 's disqualification			1
former presidents @entity58 and @entity59 , and president @entity61 's pal -- @entity62 -- had also been advised against registering but the last two did not heed the counsel and were disqualified by the gc			0
clearly , the four of us were popular and a source of concern for @entity70 , which is still haunted by the specter of 2009 post-election protests			0

specifically , @entity2 is suffering from three inter-connected problems , namely , factional infighting , conflict with the @entity84 and economic malaise			1
our platform , the only one offered by a candidate , proposes appropriate policies for the resolution of these issues , and i have been , for most of my life , a bridge builder , a peacemaker and an economic developer			0
to alleviate factional infighting , i would introduce two measures			0
first , i would build a governing coalition in which each political faction is represented on the basis of its electoral weight			0
second , i would create a @entity101 to serve as a platform for dialogue and understanding to increase transparency , find commonality , and narrow differences among factions			0
because i have never been a member or adversary of any faction , i expected to be trusted with this intermediating function			0
narrowing factional differences would help depoliticize @entity2 's @entity84 policy			1
i would introduce five other steps toward normal @entity84 - @entity2 relations			1
first , i would use my political assets in both countries to build trust between them			0
i have lived in the @entity84 and @entity2 , been a peace activist in their relations for 25 years , and i know their languages , cultures , concerns , and key policymakers			1
second , i would resolve the nuclear dispute by implementing transparency measures required to convince the @entity84 that a diversion toward military use will never happen			2
in return , i would ask that all nuclear - related sanctions be lifted			0
read more : @entity2 - @entity84 launches bid for @entity2 's presidency third , i would establish extensive channels of communication between @entity2 and the @entity84 in an effort to correct misconceptions and mis - analysis			1
to this end , i would propose a truce period during which @entity2 would stop anti-american words and acts , and @entity84 would address @entity2 with respect and recognize its national pride			1
fourth , i would correct @entity2 's @entity149 - @entity148 policy by accepting the " two - state " solution			1
last , i would propose that the @entity84 and @entity2 simultaneously announce their will to " normalize " relations through agenda - driven bilateral negotiations that would follow			1
resolving the @entity84 - @entity2 conflict and factional disputes are keys to @entity2 's economic development , which i would improve through four additional steps			1
first , i would adopt an economic plan designed to promote economic productivity , export - led industrialization , and labor market globalization			0
second , i would appoint a highly competent economic management and international advisory team			0
third , i would stabilize fiscal and monetary policies , streamline the banking system , and introduce modern workforce and entrepreneurship development programs			0
@entity171 , i would hugely expand @entity2 's economic interactions with global markets			1
through these steps , i would promote foreign investment , technology transfer and exports , increase personal income , and reduce inflation , unemployment and poverty			0
although i will not be on the ballot in 2013 , we will continue our campaign for real change in @entity2 under the banner of " @entity187			2
" i will also look for future opportunities to run again			0
we believe our platform offers the safest path to an improved @entity2 and deserves to be supported			2
other options , including another revolution , more sanctions , and war are unacceptable			0
meanwhile , we hope to convince the country 's next president to apply our realistic and pragmatic plan for national reconciliation , resolution of conflict with the @entity84 , and economic growth			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity2 's @entity1 has approved just 8 of more than *680* presidential hopefuls
@entity204 is a @entity84 - based *academic* who campaigned as a candidate
he says he was warned his campaign could lead to disorder and his safety was a concern
@entity204 waited until the last day of registration and then withdrew from the race
