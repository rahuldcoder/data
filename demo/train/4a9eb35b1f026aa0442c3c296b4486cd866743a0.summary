@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 president @entity3 arrived in @entity0 for his first state visit to @entity1 wednesday			1
@entity3 was greeted at the airport by members of parliament , government officials and @entity11 political leaders			1
the streets near the airport were packed with people in a festive mood carrying @entity4 and @entity1 flags			2
the @entity4 leader met @entity1 president @entity18 at the @entity19 here and was scheduled to meet other leaders as well as leaders of @entity11 's resistance movement			1
the @entity24 considers @entity11 , which has close ties to @entity4 and @entity26 , to be a terrorist organization			1
the @entity28 group is a political party and a major provider of social services in @entity1 , but it also operates a militant wing			2
@entity11 has boasted of numerous attacks against @entity24 , @entity34 and other @entity35 targets			1
some @entity36 see it as a heroic organization , successful in its stated objective of driving @entity34 forces from @entity1			2
@entity24 secretary of state @entity40 has expressed concern to @entity18 about @entity3 's @entity1 visit , according to a @entity45 spokesman			1
but in southern @entity1 many were happy that @entity3 was coming			1
that could be seen in places like the village of @entity50 that had been reduced to rubble by @entity34 bombings during the 2006 war between @entity11 and @entity34			2
the village is being rebuilt now largely do to money from @entity4 and @entity56			0
" what he 's done for this country is amazing , the bridges , the roads , the financial aid			0
my house burnt down , they paid me an amount for my furniture , they made up for my loss , " said @entity63 , a @entity50 resident			0
@entity4 was quick to infuse @entity71 coffers with cash , then handed out to residents who had lost their homes and otherwise been effected by the war			0
it is also @entity4 that paved roads and built bridges			0
the mayor of @entity50 emphasized just how crucial @entity4 aid to his country has been			0
" if it were n't for that money people may have not returned to their homes until now , " @entity82 explained			0
" the aid that @entity4 provided is considered one of the largest in helping rebuild after the july war , this money helped people a lot and that is why we saw people immediately returning			0
" some experts say @entity3 's visit is @entity4 's way of sending a clear message about its influence in the region , especially to the @entity24 and @entity34			1
" of course that usually is portrayed to mean that the @entity4 are going to warn how much trouble they can cause , but the flip side of the message has always been , especially in recent years , look how much good we can do , look how much influence we have to help restrain things , " @entity99 analyst @entity98 said			0
@entity4 is undeniably part of @entity1 politics , a reality that has raised concerns among those who are fearful that an increased @entity4 role could destabilize @entity1 and the region and embolden @entity11			1
analysts also point to the fact that @entity1 is the first front against @entity34			2
" it ( the visit ) plays out the idea that the @entity4 are a player			0
that in the last active front line against @entity34 , the @entity4 are the power behind the most active and powerful political actor in @entity1 which is @entity11 , " @entity98 said			1
the @entity34 government has not formally responded to @entity3 's visit but some say they view it as provocation			2
@entity128 , a spokesman for the @entity34 @entity130 told @entity2 that @entity3 's trip " is taking the form of a land lord coming to inspect his domain			1
" " @entity3 makes no mystery of his view of @entity1 as @entity4 's border with @entity34			1
it is quite clear that he comes to the region with malice toward all , with intention to destabilize an already volatile region at the service of the aggressive and extremist ideology of the ayatollahs , " @entity139 added			0
the @entity4 president 's planned visit to areas in @entity1 bordering northern @entity34 has led some in @entity34 to call for military action			1
" it is our responsibility to stop anyone who publicly calls for our destruction , " said @entity34 @entity155 member @entity154 from the far - right @entity156			0
" that responsibility means us doing something and not waiting for the world to do something			0
if a situation arises in which @entity3 is in the crosshairs of the @entity169 ( @entity169 ) , he should be killed			2
" @entity2 's @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this			0

@entity3 meets with @entity1 's president
he is also expected to meet with members of @entity11
