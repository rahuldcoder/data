-- you 've fed the birds in @entity4 's @entity3			2
lit a candle in @entity6 in @entity7			0
enjoyed that relaxing cup of cafe con leche in @entity11 's @entity10			2
what next ? if the usual itinerary of cathedrals , palaces and souvenir shops has ceased to thrill , maybe it 's time to abandon the well - trodden tourist circuit on your next trip to @entity20 and head to the river			1
during the past two decades , a number of @entity20 cities have invested heavily in redeveloping blighted industrial river fronts , turning them into charming urban retreats that emphasize sustainability , sports and local culture			1
visitors can explore on foot , or cycle , skate and even skateboard along these riverfront renovations that artfully combine traditional and modern elements to reveal a bit of each city 's soul			1
@entity39 @entity41 's royal family once enjoyed pastoral views of @entity11 's @entity43 from @entity44			1
but until recently , the @entity43 , consumed by a major motorway constructed along its banks , was unrecognizable			0
the traffic - clogged highway cut the river off from the city center , barred public access and enveloped nearby neighborhoods in a cloud of pollution			1
what do you get for $ 60,000 a night ? today , a six - mile stretch of the @entity43 known as @entity39 is one of @entity20 's newest , most ambitious riverfront projects			1
the old motorway has been removed , replaced with a greenbelt that features more than 25,000 trees , foot paths , a variety of athletic and playground facilities and scenic vistas and bridges from which to observe city landmarks			2
@entity39 also links up with other green corridors , including cycling paths that extend throughout the city			1
once an enormous slaughterhouse , @entity73 is one of the most stunning transformations of @entity39			1
it 's now a contemporary cultural center featuring art exhibits , creative workshops , music festivals , documentary film and theatrical performances			2
10 ultimate @entity85 adventures a short walk from @entity73 , the newly expanded @entity86 includes three large pools alongside the river for wading and playing amid lively fountains			2
lounge chairs and umbrellas provide pleasant waterside spaces for sunbathing			0
finally , visit @entity94 , the long - neglected orchard of @entity96			0
it has been replanted with nearly 900 trees typical of the region , including olives , almonds , pears , figs and quince			0
stop at the mirador ( viewpoint ) for a great view of many of the city 's major monuments			1
@entity112 - @entity111 since the fall of the @entity115 , this progressive city has strived to maintain a balance between large corporate development projects that bring investment and jobs , and preserving the history and artistic character of its dynamic neighborhoods			1
it 's a fascinating time to witness this struggle for the heart of the city , and a lot of it is playing out along the @entity111 , in neighborhoods like @entity129 and @entity130			1
@entity132 's best hotel restaurants after the wall fell , these areas — on either side of the river — flourished as hip , alternative havens			1
vacant lots became vibrant community gardens and art spaces , and drab apartment blocks became artists ' studios , cheerful cooperative living spaces and diverse underground nightclubs			0
these areas have gentrified considerably , but you 'll still find eclectic flea markets , independent designer shops and great global cuisine			0
consider taking a walking tour led by the nonprofit @entity153 , which emphasizes grass - roots efforts to maintain the green , creative character of the neighborhoods			2
finally , visit the @entity157 , one of the last standing segments of the @entity115 , which has become an inspiring artistic monument to peace and freedom			0
@entity163 , head to @entity165 , literally the center , or " middle , " of the city			2
in the middle of the @entity111 , you 'll find @entity171 ( @entity172 ) , home to several museums that collectively feature 6,000 years of artifacts and art. close by is the historic @entity177 ( @entity179 parliament building ) with its strikingly modern glass dome and the @entity115			1
it 's not far from here to other important historic sites like the @entity184 to the @entity185 and the @entity186			2
before you go , be sure to visit the famous " beach bars " on the banks of the river			2
as you sip your caipirinha or local brew in a beach chair surrounded by palm trees , you 'll marvel at how rapidly this city evolves and changes			2
@entity196 -- @entity197 ( @entity197 ) centuries ago , the @entity197 launched @entity200 explorers out to sea on their journeys to @entity203 , @entity204 and the @entity205 and guided immigrants into this port city			0
the exchange of cultures that gives @entity196 its distinctive architectural and culinary character is also apparent in the city 's riverfront development , which began in the 1990s when @entity196 was named the @entity213			1
there are several points from which to embark on the 4.5 - mile walk along the river			0
one nice starting point is the enormous and colorful @entity219 do @entity220 , one of @entity196 's best - known squares			0
moving from tradition to trendy , the next stop is @entity225 do @entity226			0
redevelopment rid the area of its reputation for seedy bars and brothels ; today it 's home to hot clubs and great restaurants			0
visit the famous @entity235 for fantastic fruits , vegetables and flowers			0
@entity241 's @entity240 winners carry on and you 'll arrive at the @entity243 , with its river views and impressive collection of ancient art. another opportunity for good food and drink awaits at the cafes along the @entity253 docks			1
you 'll need your energy for the next leg of your journey to @entity258 , a neighborhood rich in museums , gardens and cafes			0
then again , maybe it 's best to save another full day for @entity258 's treasures			0
instead , grab a @entity265 ( a custard tart ) from a traditional bakery , and lose yourself back at the river 's edge			1
@entity4 - @entity270 the @entity270 is already a popular tourist destination , but until recently , most visitors did n't make it farther east than the @entity273			1
that 's changing with the impressive transformation of a once bleak wasteland known as the @entity277			1
until the mid- 20th century , @entity4 's docks supported one of the busiest ports in the world			0
but between the 1960s and the 1980s , the docks closed as shipping traffic shifted to larger coastal ports , and @entity4 was left with more than 5,000 acres of derelict land			0
since the government put a plan in place to revitalize the @entity277 in the early 1980s , the area has grown to become a mixture of residential , commercial and light industrial properties , with @entity294 — now a major business district and shopping destination — as its centerpiece			1
the 2012 @entity298 provided another huge opportunity to expand waterfront redevelopment , accentuating the contrast between old and new			0
today you can wander narrow cobblestone streets to find cafes and historic riverside pubs , and then ascend to spectacular views atop the @entity307 , a spire - shaped , gleaming glass skyscraper completed in 2012			0
do n't miss the @entity309 , which surveys the area 's history from @entity312 to its recent redevelopment			2
a fun way to see the @entity277 is via the new @entity316 cable cars that cross the river to @entity318 , home of the @entity319 , on the @entity320 of the @entity270			1
rent a bike and take it on the cable car to explore the @entity323 , which passes through @entity318 and eventually crosses back to @entity294 and historic neighborhoods like @entity325 before returning to the @entity320 via @entity273 .			0

@entity39 has been transformed from a highway to an urban river *paradise*
@entity111 embodies the formerly divided @entity112 's attempts to respect its history and future
