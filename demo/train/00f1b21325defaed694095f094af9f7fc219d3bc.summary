" the protest of controversial books is nothing new , but one particularly sensitive reader in @entity8 issued a challenge over something a bit less sensational			0
that contentious tome : dr. @entity13 " although it 's unclear whether the removal request was filed by an actual @entity18 or intended in jest , the complaint stated that the book should be removed because it " encourages children to use violence against their fathers			1
" the complaint further demanded that fathers be apologized to and reimbursed for any damages arising from children 's reading of the book			1
according to @entity31 , the director of collections management , the @entity30 has a system for processing requests to remove books from its collection , though fewer than 100 have been filed since 2000			0
of those , only five were actually removed " because they contained inaccurate or dated information			0
" among them was a children 's book on dairy farming that had outdated farming information			2
former first lady @entity46 outlined the potential for violence in 2006			0
she said her children , when very small , actually took the book to literally mean they should jump on their father			2
president @entity52 was reportedly uninjured in the incident			0
in addressing the complaint , the library pointed out that the book is included on many " best of " lists for children and that dr. @entity59 is a @entity60 - winning author			2
however , one particular argument was probably the death knell for this request : " the children are actually told not to hop on @entity64 " the only words uttered by the eponymous pop in the 390 - word title are an admonition to refrain from such activity : " stop			1
you must not hop on @entity64 " the request was officially denied , and " @entity75 " remains in the library 's collection .			1

@entity77 said " @entity75 " encouraged violence against fathers
the 1963 book uses *rhymed* words and silly *pictures* to help children learn to read
in the book , @entity64 says , " stop . you must not hop on @entity64 "
