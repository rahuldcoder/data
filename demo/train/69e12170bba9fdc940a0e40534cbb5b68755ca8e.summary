-- the @entity1 and the @entity3 ' organization may have upstaged @entity5 's latest soundtrack friday afternoon with the announcement that @entity7 , former @entity8 and @entity10 chairman , is the new ceo of the team			1
the public relations contrast was stark : as the @entity1 and the @entity3 were moving forward , @entity5 's statements were coming from surreptitiously ( or not so surreptitiously ) recorded phone conversations			1
but now , he has spoken out directly in an interview with @entity0 's @entity16			1
@entity5 says in that interview that he was " baited " into making his controversial statements			1
and he makes the argument that he should n't be thrown out of the @entity1			1
" i 'm a good member who made a mistake and i 'm apologizing and i 'm asking for forgiveness , " he said			0
" am i entitled to one mistake , am i after 35 years ? i mean , i love my league , i love my partners			0
am i entitled to one mistake ? it 's a terrible mistake , and i 'll never do it again			0
" @entity5 is not the only party suffering from this controversy			1
the @entity1 stands at the beginning of what will certainly be a protracted legal and procedural battle , one that will cost untold millions			1
it also will embroil the @entity1 in an unwanted controversy for years to come			1
having a chief executive of @entity36 ' stature in control of the team may help the league gain an advantage as a battle over the team 's ownership starts to play out , but the @entity1 's road ahead still will not be easy			1
but the @entity1 asked for this			1
the fact that players and the public largely supported the league will be of little solace to the @entity1 when it is paying legal fees for years to come			1
the legal fees may be the cost of doing business , but if banning and fining @entity5 would have been adequate , this was an avoidable cost			2
the @entity1 's response to the @entity5 controversy is a cautionary tale against meting out hasty , summary punishment			1
here 's why : the @entity1 likely had the authority to unilaterally fine @entity61 as it did			1
it also appears to have had the authority to ban him from his team for life			2
if commissioner @entity66 had stopped there , @entity61 might have been effectively vanquished , because the decisions of the commissioner are shielded from review by a court			0
for the privilege of joining the @entity1 , owners contractually give up certain legal rights and remedies			2
fining and banning @entity61 was probably well within the jurisdiction of the @entity1			2
but in seeking to " max out " @entity5 's sentence by forcing him to sell the team , the @entity1 is forging new legal territory , and doing so at a price			1
sure , there are catch - all provisions of the @entity1 's rules that ostensibly allow for ouster of an owner who brings harm to the league , but the ouster rules on the whole appear designed for dealing with teams and owners suffering economic or management problems , like failing to make payroll -- not for owners who were private bigots			1
there will be an answer to the ultimate question of whether the @entity1 can legally oust @entity61			1
we just do n't know what it is yet			0
the league and @entity61 can purchase an answer to that question , at the cost of years of litigation and untold fortunes in legal fees			0
moreover , if the @entity1 's objective was to distance itself from @entity61 , they have done the opposite			2
after years of prolonged public litigation , they will cling to each other as two spent swimmers , choking their own business interests in the process			0
early on , @entity66 made clear that the punitive measures were directed at @entity61 , not at other members of his family			0
with this blessing , estranged wife @entity121 has injected herself as a blame - free alternative owner			0
but does she have an ownership interest in the team ? determining true ownership of this team will be a @entity127 of litigation : first , there is the issue of whether the @entity1 can oust an owner where actual " ownership " is disputed			1
if the team is held in trust , as reported by the @entity134 , and not by a single owner in @entity61 , that changes the contours of ownership			0
a trust is a legal entity in which property ( like a team ) is held for the benefit of other persons			0
it 's a protective device , designed for situations just like this : where a beneficiary of a trust is attacked , the property can not be reached because the beneficiary does not actually " own " the property -- even though he may receive payments or otherwise profit from the property			0
the complexity does n't end there , though			0
even without a trust , in @entity155 , spouses acquire interests in family businesses when distributing property in a divorce			0
but that is only a general rule , and who knows what default rules @entity5 has attempted to deal with by contract ? one thing is for sure , whether it 's the @entity1 , @entity121 , or @entity5 , each party will mount a different legal argument concerning ownership based upon their own best interests			1
determining the " owner " of the @entity3 will be a hodgepodge of legal issues worthy of the bar exam : divorce law , corporate dissolution , trusts and estates law			1
for now , @entity121 is a cause for concern for the @entity1 , the other owners , and her own husband			2
she has leverage , possibly even 50 % ownership of the team			0
the @entity1 owners must be longing for the " good old days " when their biggest problems were contract disputes and torn acls			2
we can only guess at the individual owners ' respective positions at the moment @entity66 handed down verdict and sentence against @entity61			0
now , the commissioner has placed the onus on the owners : they have the burden of deciding whether to oust one of their own			0
it is a @entity205 , which is no choice at all : even if the owners are privately sympathetic to @entity61 , an owner who dares to defend the embattled @entity3 owner commits social seppuku			1
on the other hand , @entity1 owners are independent thinkers and independently wealthy ; if anyone can weather criticism , it 's these captains of industry			2
@entity216 has already publicly observed that " people are allowed to be morons			0
" whether the owners ultimately cast their ballots for or against @entity61 , all of these owners would rather be somewhere else			0
public perception aside , the owners have other concerns : if this case goes to litigation , expect broad - reaching discovery demands and subpoenas for sensitive documents and information			0
this case is a minefield for them , with no real upside			0
at the moment , there appear to be a few winners in the @entity5 controversy			2
@entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 are just some of the companies that pulled advertising from the @entity3 after the first tapes were revealed			2
ironically , they garnered more buzz by not spending money advertising than they would have by actually spending money on advertising			0
it 's the ultimate win - win , and it 's not over yet			0
as long as someone else spends the time and money to excise @entity5 from the @entity3 , the sponsors will have a second photo op. they will return triumphantly to advertising with the team , and take partial credit for the brave stance against one offensive octogenarian -- a stance that did n't actually require them to do , or spend , anything			1
heading into the weekend , the advantage is with @entity121 -- who may have a valid claim to ownership -- the @entity1 , and @entity36 , the highly credentialed , newly anointed ceo			1
@entity5 's next moves will be interesting , though his first moves should be away from the telephone -- at least for now .			2

@entity1 named @entity7 as new ceo of the @entity3
@entity276 says @entity1 is moving ahead while @entity5 speaks out in @entity16 interview
he says the @entity1 is at beginning of a long and perhaps *difficult* road to oust @entity5 as owner
@entity276 : @entity282 clearly had authority to fine and ban @entity5
