what kind of weapon can shoot down a fully loaded passenger jet flying at nearly 33,000 feet ? that could be a key question in the @entity6 flight 17 crash investigation , as officials try to determine what was responsible for thursday 's plane crash in volatile eastern @entity10			0
a radar system saw a surface - to - air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down , a senior @entity12 official told @entity18 's @entity17			1
and a second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit			0
the @entity12 is analyzing the trajectory of the missile to pinpoint where the attack came from , the official said			1
@entity26 , adviser to the @entity27 , said in a @entity29 post that " terrorists " fired on the plane operating a @entity32 surface - to - air missile system			1
a @entity10 official also told @entity18 's @entity35 on thursday that separatists claimed to have brought down another plane around the same time @entity38 went missing			0
but what could have shot down the @entity6 flight ? shoulder - fired missiles sometimes in the arsenals of rebel and separatists groups would be ruled out , experts said			2
" at normal cruising altitude a civilian passenger aircraft would be out of the range of the sort of manned portable air ( defense ) systems that we have seen proliferate in rebel hands in east @entity10 , " @entity47 's @entity46 said in an e-mail			2
such shoulder - mounted weapons at best can reach 15,000 feet , said @entity18 military analyst @entity59 , a retired @entity60 lieutenant colonel			2
" this would indicate a surface - to - air missile or an air - to - air missile , and i think a surface - to - air missile is probably the best guess right now , " he said			1
one candidate is the @entity32 missile system , developed during the @entity69 era and operated by @entity71 and @entity10 forces			1
the missile system , known as the @entity32 among @entity74 forces , is operated by both @entity71 and @entity10 forces , according to retired @entity76			1
gen. @entity77 , director of the @entity78 at the @entity79 at @entity80			0
and it 's more than capable of taking down an airliner flying at that altitude , he said			0
such weapons travel with @entity71 troops at the division level , @entity59 said			2
" so the @entity71 on the other side of the @entity10 border will have all of this weaponry available to them , " he said			0
other possibilities include @entity71 - made @entity93 missiles that are operated by the @entity10 military as well as the @entity71 @entity95 and @entity97 missiles			1
the latter weapons are the @entity71 equivalent of @entity12 patriot missile defense batteries			1
what seems unlikely is that @entity103 separatists might have gained control of such a sophisticated piece of weaponry and used it to shoot down an airliner , @entity77 said			0
" it takes a lot of training and a lot of coordination to fire one of these and hit something , " he said			0
typically , a surface - to - air battery missile consists of a command post vehicle , a radar vehicle , several self - propelled launchers , loader vehicles and even more vehicles to carry new missiles to the batteries as necessary , according to @entity124 , @entity125 editor for @entity126 's			1
@entity77 concludes then that if the plane really was shot down , a professional military force -- either on purpose or by accident -- was responsible			0
" this is not the kind of weapon a couple of guys are going to pull out of a garage and fire , " he said .			0

senior @entity12 official : radar saw surface - to - air missile system track aircraft
a sophisticated surface - to - air missile was more likely used , experts say
one possibility is the @entity71 - made @entity32 , retired @entity147 officer says
the sophisticated weapon would require professional *soldiers* , expert says
