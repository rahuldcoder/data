@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity1 prime minister @entity6 's assassination was her own fault , the country 's president , @entity3 , said in an interview on @entity10 television			1
@entity6 sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination			1
" for standing up outside the car , i think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else			1
responsibility is hers , " the former general told @entity22 ' " @entity21 " on sunday			0
@entity6 was killed december 27 in @entity0 , south of the @entity1 capital @entity24 , while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now - postponed parliamentary elections			1
her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack			0
the cause of her death is not clear : a bomber blew himself up near @entity6 's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present , though no autopsy has been carried out			1
asked if @entity6 could have been shot , @entity3 said , " yes , absolutely , yes			1
" he has said he welcomes an international investigation			0
@entity3 , who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to @entity6 , who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister			1
he noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and " was given more security than any other person			2
" asked about the hunt for @entity54 leader @entity53 , widely rumored to be in the remote border region between @entity1 and @entity56 , @entity3 said , " there is no proof whatsoever that he 's here			1
we are not particularly looking for him , but we are operating against this -- and @entity54 and militant @entity62			0
and in the process , obviously , it is combined			0
maybe we are looking for him also			0
" and @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity10 , @entity67 , told @entity2 's " @entity68 " that , " if we knew where he was , we would have taken him out			0
" @entity67 added that @entity3 's comment about " not specifically looking for @entity53 " means that the @entity1 military is " totally focused on destroying @entity54 and the @entity62 network and not just one person			1
" about @entity6 's death , he noted only that the investigation is not completed " and we should not jump to conclusions			1
" still , he added , " if she had not come out of the vehicle , the protected and armored vehicle , maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today			2
" though @entity3 's popularity at home has plummeted , he retains support from @entity85 presidential contender sen. @entity84			1
" i think he 's a good man , " the @entity86 told @entity89 's " @entity88			0
" " but i think he 's made mistakes , do n't get me wrong			0
and we 've got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair			0
" but i can work with him			0
he understands the threat to his country that the @entity62 and @entity54 present			0
he 's a very smart man			0
he 'd be one of the first to go			0
they 've tried to kill him nine times , ok ? nine times they 've tried to kill @entity3			2
he 's not their favorite guy			0
" the @entity104 reported sunday that the @entity106 administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of @entity1 to shore up support for @entity3 's government and to find @entity53 and his second in command , @entity113			1
@entity115 presidential candidate @entity114 of @entity116 told @entity2 's " @entity68 " that , though he had not heard details of the plan , " it sounds like a strategy that makes sense			0
" he added , " we have got to take whatever action is needed			0
" @entity114 has called for @entity3 to step down and has called for free and fair elections			2
" what we need to do is ask @entity3 , push him , push him to step aside for the good of the country , because he is widely unpopular , " he told @entity2			2
sen. @entity129 , a @entity115 presidential candidate from @entity130 , said saturday that she would try to persuade @entity3 to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country 's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the @entity10 and perhaps @entity135			1
meanwhile , detectives from @entity135 's @entity138 on sunday once again examined the white @entity139 that @entity6 was riding in when she was assassinated , @entity1 's state - run news agency said			1
the @entity140 of @entity1 said the detectives also watched videos of @entity6 's last moments three times , and looked at bird 's eye view photographs of @entity147 park taken from a building that overlooks the @entity0 public site			1
the team of five detectives arrived in @entity1 friday after @entity3 agreed they should work alongside @entity1 agencies to determine how @entity6 was killed and who was responsible for her death			1
on saturday , the team spent more than two hours at the park			0
@entity3 said he expected the @entity138 investigators to help " solve all the confusion " surrounding the case			2
@entity6 's husband , @entity159 , wants a @entity161 inquiry into his late wife 's assassination			1
the @entity1 interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car 's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy			2
however , supporters of @entity6 insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast			2
