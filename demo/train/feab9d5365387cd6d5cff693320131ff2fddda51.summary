-- after a decade in prison you look at time differently , says @entity3			1
the former @entity5 oligarch , whom president @entity6 unexpectedly pardoned in december , is visiting @entity7 this week , sharing his thoughts with people who knew him back in @entity10 -- before prison , before his @entity12 was dismantled , before he lost his estimated fortune of $ 15 billion			1
since @entity6 pardoned him after 10 years in a @entity15 labor camp over tax evasion , embezzlement and money laundering -- charges he has continued to deny -- @entity3 has , for the most part , steered clear of direct involvement in @entity5 's internal political situation			1
but this has n't stopped him from criticizing @entity6 's actions in @entity25 , and arguing that the @entity5 president is ignoring " global and strategic challenges " to his country , " using his office to avenge a personal grudge			1
" and @entity3 appears to be taking his concerns over @entity5 's direction a step further , relaunching @entity35 , a group he founded in 2001 to foster civic organizations			1
the group was shut down in 2006 , its accounts frozen by the @entity5 government			1
but @entity3 says he is looking to unite @entity5 with a " @entity40 mindset , " a group , he estimates , at around 12 % of the @entity5 public			1
yet the prospects for @entity5 civic life appear dim , at least for now			1
the reality is that the demonstrations against @entity6 in 2011 - 2012 -- protests that drew tens of thousands of @entity5 to the streets of @entity10 and other big cities over what international observers claimed was vote fraud in parliamentary elections -- petered out , with most of the protest leaders ending up under house arrest or in jail			1
true , protesters took to the streets again in september to demonstrate against @entity5 's military action in @entity25 , but their numbers were smaller			2
stringent laws against multiple demonstrations , as well as new election laws , have made it harder to register political parties or publicly express opposition to @entity67 policies			0
meanwhile , the @entity67 has also cracked down on nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from abroad , accusing them of being " foreign agents			0
" all this suggests that @entity3 is likely correct when he says the opposition can not win in 2016			2
if he 's right , it raises the question of how long @entity6 will rule @entity5			2
@entity3 reels off his odds : a small probability , about 10 % , that @entity6 will lose his position in two years -- " but he has to make a mistake			1
" so far , as @entity3 sees it , @entity6 has n't made any big mistakes			2
even faced with @entity84 sanctions over @entity5 's incursion into @entity25 , @entity6 has convinced many @entity5 " it 's those nasty @entity86 " who are trying to punish @entity5 for its " independent " foreign policy			2
that strategy resonates with many @entity5 who 've confronted economic hardship from time immemorial with a stoic : " we must endure			2
" certainly , @entity6 appears to have stoked the flames of nationalism and resentment that many @entity5 still feel after the fall of the @entity97			2
in the long term , this manipulation of emotion , fanned by @entity67 - controlled propaganda campaigns , is dangerous			0
and , as @entity6 's more rabid nationalist supporters egg him on to take even more draconian action , it is not clear that even the @entity5 president can control this explosion of anger			2
when i ask @entity3 about his likely future role in @entity5 politics , he denies he 's proposing the creation of a political party			1
it never worked out before and the authorities destroy any competing political structures			0
his model , he says , is something more amorphous , like what happens during @entity86 elections : people come together to solve problems by allying with a certain political party during a campaign with only the " skeleton " of a party remaining after the election			0
@entity3 stops short of saying he would run for @entity5 's president			1
but in the same breath , he says he 's willing to offer himself as a " political representative " to @entity40 - minded @entity5			1
" i will give it a try , " he says			0
" i do n't know if it will work out			0
" such doubt is understandable			0
many average @entity5 despise him as a rapacious rich man , ripping off the system to amass billions			0
some @entity84 - oriented @entity5 , meanwhile , still harbor doubts about @entity3 's murky roots in @entity5 's " @entity140 " capitalism after the fall of the @entity97			1
@entity67 allies still accuse him of having " blood on his hands " from vendettas against his early business competitors			0
so why is @entity3 here in @entity7 ? he says he is trying " to help people understand " what he is doing			0
" we really do n't like it when they say , ' we 'd rather see a known @entity6 than an unknown alternative			0
' " @entity3 places the odds that @entity6 will be out of power in the next 20 years at 90 % but adds ominously : " when he goes , he will not go in a democratic way			1
" regardless , it is easy to see why @entity6 is popular now : thanks to burgeoning oil prices , he has helped raise average @entity5 ' salaries and fatten the bank accounts of those who run large government - friendly corporations , many of them in the oil and gas sector			0
in addition , during the @entity25 crisis , @entity6 has stirred up fear of @entity171 and the @entity140 attacking @entity5			0
but the prospects of someone like @entity3 being there to pick up the pieces if and when @entity6 's popularity eventually wanes are unclear -- as is whether he would even want to be the one to lead change			1
" i hope they will find someone else , " he adds			0
" after all , people who lead transitions like these usually end up in jail , " he says smilingly , " and i 've had enough of that			0
