we awoke one morning in @entity1 to the sound of not - too - distant explosions , marking the start to the fighting season			0
but bombs were not the foremost takeaway from our @entity8 to @entity9 -- the women fighting to stop the bombs left a more lasting impression			1
more than a decade after @entity14 and allied forces toppled the @entity16 regime , the improvement in the quality of life for @entity9 women is unmistakable			1
women are now participants -- and in many cases , leaders -- in a society that once systematically subjugated them			0
there are female government officials at almost every level , young girls going to school , young women in college , and new opportunities cropping up around the country			0
on a sixth annual trip , our congressional delegation of women legislators spent several days in @entity9 in may meeting with many of the women who have helped begin to reverse centuries of repression			1
we spoke with female public officials , women journalists , and heads of organizations focused on advancing the role of women			0
and we had the privilege to spend time with a special group of people who , although they are not from @entity9 , have a unique appreciation for what @entity9 women are fighting for			1
on @entity55 we met our " military moms " -- women soldiers from the @entity14 who have children back home			0
we delivered @entity55 cards made by @entity14 school children , hosted a luncheon and listened to their stories of heroism and sacrifice			0
it became clear that all these women -- @entity9 , @entity14 or otherwise -- are determined to preserve and grow the progress made by @entity9 women and girls			1
the most striking example came when we met with women members of the @entity9 parliament			1
at a roundtable , we discussed the opportunities that have been made available to @entity9 women and girls over the past decade ; the important role they must play in the country 's society , security and economy in order to see future success ; and the critical need to protect these gains from backsliding			1
" we can bring democracy to @entity9 , " one of the @entity88 said			2
for emphasis , another added : " we can deliver			0
" by engaging with the @entity9 people directly , we experienced firsthand the growing sense of cautious optimism that seems to have taken root here , due in large part to women 's gains and to the recent national elections			1
there is no mistaking that the situation in @entity9 is still fragile and highly complicated			2
yes , the elections in april saw relative success with high voter turnout , a higher than expected turnout among women , and relatively small amounts of violence			2
but runoff elections set for june 14 are another important test of the coalition - trained @entity9 security forces and voter retention			1
a bilateral security agreement needs to be signed			0
both remaining presidential candidates have signaled their willingness to participate in such an agreement , but details are yet to be finalized			0
a clear plan to maintain @entity9 women 's gains must be included			1
our delegation urged for more focus to be placed on recruiting women to the @entity128			0
the @entity129 currently has 700 women in the security forces , but that number needs to be increased significantly			0
last week , president @entity133 announced that 9,800 @entity14 troops will remain in @entity9 after the end of 2014 , with that number stepping down in subsequent years			2
no one wants our troops to stay in @entity9 one moment longer than necessary , and the transition from a combat role to one of training and advisory must be done carefully and responsibly			2
@entity9 must take the reins of their country 's future , and @entity14 must play an important role in ensuring a lasting peace			2
a secure @entity9 ultimately impacts @entity14 's national security			2
and strong signals of @entity14 support contribute to the confidence of the @entity9 people			0
an important bellwether for the success or failure of @entity14 's efforts in @entity9 will be the preservation of the gains made by @entity9 women			1
if the bombs we heard that morning in @entity1 reminded us of the challenges that remain here , the women we met in @entity9 personified how far this country has come , and the potential for where it goes next			1
join us on @entity173 / @entity172 .			0

a *bipartisan* coalition of women in @entity177 visited women in @entity9
the improvement in the quality of life for @entity9 women is unmistakable , they say
still , long - term success will be in the preservation of the gains made by @entity9 women
