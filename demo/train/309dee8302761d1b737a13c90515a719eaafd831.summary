@entity0 , @entity1 -- with @entity1 returning to an uneasy calm down after a fatal artillery attack on an offshore island tuesday , @entity4 watchers in @entity0 were scrambling to explain what may have been the thinking behind @entity11 's fatal attack			1
experts offered a range of opinions , saying that recent events could be a show of strength designed to bolster the reputation of the successor to the state 's leadership , and suggesting that @entity4 's recent actions fit into a predictable pattern of provocation			1
others , however , warned that @entity4 's military brinksmanship will continue regardless of who is in charge in @entity11 , and warn that if @entity1 does retaliate , it could ignite a potentially lethal --- and uncontrollable -- cycle of escalation			1
read more @entity2 coverage on @entity4 even @entity1 's defense minister was drawn into the speculation			1
" our judgment is that @entity4 carried out the attack to consolidate the succession process in the country by showing off the leadership of @entity41 , " @entity1 's @entity35 news agency quoted defense minister @entity42 as saying in a meeting with lawmakers			1
@entity41 , the third son of ailing @entity4 leader @entity45 , was named a four - star general just before a rare @entity47 in september , and was named to the party 's powerful military committee			1
he has since been seen widely alongside his father and senior generals , leading @entity4 watchers to believe that a succession process is now under way , designed to place the younger @entity41 in his father 's place on the latter 's passing			1
@entity1 pundits agreed with the minister			0
" the first reason for this attack is the instability of @entity41			0
that is the fundamental reason , " said @entity63 , who heads the @entity64 for @entity4 , which maintains a network of contacts north of the two @entity68 ' demilitarized zone			1
" constant military tensions help him to keep the support of his military , and to unite the @entity4 people			1
" others suggested that it is the militaristic nature of @entity4 society , rather than the current succession process that is the key to its behavior			2
" i think there is a danger in the @entity87 's tendency to interpret all @entity4 actions in the context of topical events , in other words , by saying everything @entity4 is doing is aimed at ensuring a smooth succession for @entity41 , " said @entity80 , author of " @entity81 , " an authoritative study of @entity4 propaganda			2
" this is implying that once @entity41 is firmly seated in power , this behavior is not going to continue , and i think that is dangerous			0
if you are a military first regime , you flex your muscles ; this is what @entity4 is , and this is what it does			1
" while some in the @entity1 had hoped that @entity45 's successor might be reform - minded , recent events , and @entity41 's strong identification with the @entity107 , suggests a continuation -- or possibly a buttressing -- of the regime 's current @entity110 , or " military first " policy			1
still , the apparently calibrated pattern of recent @entity4 provocations --- last week , it was revealed that @entity4 had displayed a new and well - equipped uranium enrichment plant to visiting @entity120 scientists -- is predictable , another expert said			1
" @entity124 asked in late summer for a resumption of aid and essentially they were ignored , so now they are sending a message to @entity1 --- by shelling an island -- and to @entity120 --- with their uranium plant --- that they are not withering away , they are still here and still dangerous , " said @entity121 , a @entity4 expert at @entity0 's @entity122			1
" they chose the soft spots of both sides , so this is a way to a send a message to both the @entity137 and the @entity138 : " we are here , we are crazy , we are dangerous			0
and our last paycheck is long overdue			0
" read more from @entity121 the @entity138 is the @entity1 presidential residence			0
alternatively , @entity4 could have felt legitimately threatened , said another expert , citing the fact that @entity11 had demanded the halt to a @entity1 firing exercise off their shared coast --- the @entity1 side refused to heed the demand -- before it opened fire			1
" the @entity124 sound like communist lunatics , and fanatics , when in fact most soldiers in the @entity4 army are tending rabbits and farming crops , " said @entity151 , a biographer of @entity45			2
" there is good reason for them to be nervous : there is firing off their coast			0
they have to make a judgment call , so they start , and the whole world thinks they are bad guys , and that @entity41 is strengthening its position , but it could have been a miscalculation			0
" tuesday 's attack was the second time this year that the @entity4 has introduced a weapons system that has been unused on the peninsula since the 1950 - 53 @entity176 , @entity1 says			2
in march , a @entity1 warship , the @entity178 , was sunk in what a @entity1 investigation says was a @entity4 submarine torpedo attack			2
the @entity107 has denied sinking the warship			2
tuesday 's artillery exchange was the first such since an armistice , rather than a peace treaty , halted the fighting in summer 1953			0
while @entity1 president @entity187 has demanded massive retaliation should @entity4 repeat its actions , that raises a risk of dropping the peninsula into a potentially uncontrollable vortex of retaliation and counter-retaliation			2
still , there are limits to the country 's forbearance			0
" @entity202 has been pretty tolerant , but how much can you tolerate ? " asked @entity199 , who heads the @entity201 's @entity0 office			0
" i do n't know what the red line is , but if you do n't retaliate , this is giving a green light " to @entity4			0
should retaliation take place , could it unleash @entity209 ? " i think it is unlikely , i think it will cool off , " @entity199 said			0
" but it is dangerous			0

opinions vary widely among @entity4 watchers
theories *include* a show of strength and a miscalculated *reaction* to an apparent threat
another expert says the @entity107 is frustrated by being ignored *diplomatically*
yet another theory : @entity11 needs constant military tension to unite its people
