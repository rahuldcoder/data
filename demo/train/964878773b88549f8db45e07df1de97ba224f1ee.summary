@entity0 -- the father 's first comment , when he heard i was in his city to talk about a book i 'd written about kids , mental health issues and medication , came loudly and fast : " when my daughter was 10 , my ex-wife and a psychiatrist called to try to get my permission to put her on @entity14			1
i refused , " he said proudly			2
" i was n't going to let them drug my kid			2
" we spent quite a few hours together			2
by nighttime , as he drove me back from the last event , his mood was altered , his tone notably more somber			2
it had been a day of impassioned testimonials from parents of children with mental health issues , and even from one teenager , who called in to a radio show to describe how taking medication for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder had helped him " level the playing field " with other kids and made it possible for him to attend college			1
" i do n't know if we did the right thing by her , " the dad said at last , thinking of his daughter as he looked out at the dark road ahead			2
his daughter 's life had never really come together			1
she had dropped out of college ; her future was unclear			2
she presented a happy face to her dad , but deep down , he felt , the truth of her life was n't so sunny			1
" i do n't know how to read her , " he said			0
" i really do n't know what to do			0
" we all know what the prevailing opinion is these days on children 's mental health in @entity56 : kids with nothing truly wrong with them are being over-diagnosed and overmedicated by doctors , parents and schools , who are colluding to make them better behaved , more high - performing and more tractable to our society 's unnaturally high demands			1
this opinion used to be mine			0
it was the basic line of my argument at the beginning of my research , when the only information - gathering i 'd done on the topic consisted of reading and compiling the already - recycled reporting of others			1
but soon , the facts got in the way			0
surveys and statistics showed that the story of over-diagnosis and overmedication was wrong ; 5 percent of children in @entity56 take psychotropic medication , while 5 to 20 percent are estimated to have mental health issues			1
the vast majority of those in need of help never get any care at all			0
the facts are incontrovertible : kids ' mental health issues are real , they 're serious , and they often cause profound suffering			1
and they 're not new			0
listening to parents gave me a very concrete answer to the question so many skeptics ask as to where all the kids with " issues " were a generation ago			1
we existed , many of the parents of kids who now are getting diagnosed told me			1
and no one noticed that we were suffering			1
and , they said , they were n't going to let the same not - noticing , or the same labeling with words like " lazy " or " stupid " or " bad , " happen to their kids today			1
interviews with about 100 parents and doctors showed that rather than rushing to pathologize and medicate their kids , parents did all they could to avoid " labeling " their children and put off using medication -- if they used it at all -- until they really were desperate			1
what these interviews showed above all is that for parents and children ( and grown children ) dealing with mental health issues , life is complicated , unsure and filled with unanswered questions that ca n't be addressed by gross generalizations about the " medicated child " in our time			1
it 's very hard to get at any of that complexity -- and humanity -- when we typically talk about children 's mental health in the media			1
journalism generally does n't lend itself to complicated messages ; we need eye - grabbing headlines and strong voices spouting easy - to - summarize arguments , opinions which , in the strangely evolving media world of today , have come to have far greater currency than fact			1
in another city , a mother told me that she 'd never attended college			0
she would have liked to have gone , she said , but she earned almost all cs in high school , and no one had ever presented it to her as a possibility			0
" i do n't think i was dumb , " she said , " i just could n't keep my mind focused on my work			0
" at 48 , she wondered , was it too late to find out if she had the inattentive kind of @entity160 ? she 'd become a model after high school instead			0
she 'd married a lawyer ; she lived in the kind of community where former high achievers made a second career of micromanaging their children 's lives			0
she wanted to be an involved mother , too , but when she spoke at school meetings , the high - power moms made her feel invisible			2
" they talk right over me , " she said			0
" it 's like i do n't exist			0
" her husband was out of work			0
after so many decades , her own lack of a college degree still burned as a cause of embarrassment , worry and resentment			0
how could her parents , she mused aloud , not have encouraged her to try to at least try to get into college ? it is very easy to look at a woman like this and say , who cares ? she turned out ok -- more than ok , after all			2
but her voice was full of pain as she talked about the feelings of inferiority that still haunted her			0
had n't she had the right to at least try to live up to her potential ? she was committed to making sure that her daughter would have every possible option			0
behind the black - and - white shouting matches that now dominate discussions of children 's mental health in our country , there are stories like these			1
they are n't necessarily headline - making			2
but they 're powerful , and true			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			1

@entity210 says common view is modern parents *over-medicate* kids for mental health
but her research showed that most parents avoid meds , are *sensitive* to kids ' suffering
kids ' mental health issues not new ; now better diagnosed , so seem newly prevalent , she says
@entity226 : real - life stories reflect parents ' struggling to do right by kids , not just " *normalize* " them
