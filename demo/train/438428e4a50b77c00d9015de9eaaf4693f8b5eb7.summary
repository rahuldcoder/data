-- dr. @entity1 and her colleagues intended to study the impact modernized playground equipment had on lowering children 's injury rates			2
they ended up studying kids ' injury rates from guns instead			2
the associate professor of public health , medicine and surgery at the @entity16 's @entity15 in @entity17 said she was neither motivated by the recent mass shooting in her area nor driven by politics			0
" my colleagues and i were doing a study on playground injuries , because they were doing some remodeling projects here , and we wanted to see if that would change the playground injury rate , " @entity1 said			1
" when we started coding the trauma data , which includes all types of childhood injuries that turn up at these trauma centers , and we noticed the morbid pattern of gun violence - related injuries for children ... that shifted the focus of the study to document violence related to injuries involving gunshots			1
" the data , she said , showed a surprising number of children were being injured , many of them seriously , by guns			1
" we had the impression that mass shootings caused so many injuries and those normally do get a lot of national attention , but in looking at the numbers , gun violence was happening to children on a routine basis , and it was mostly happening out of the spotlight , " @entity1 said			1
" these are not isolated tragedies			0
" she and her colleagues knew they were on to something , putting together a research letter called " @entity61 in 2 @entity63 : 2000 - 2008 , " which was published tuesday in the @entity62			2
the data covers some of the years between the two mass shootings in the @entity67 area -- the 1999 one at @entity68 that resulted in 13 deaths and more than 20 injuries before the shooters took their own lives , and july 's mass shooting at a movie theater in @entity17 that killed 12 people and wounded 58			1
@entity68 survivor : no child should worry about gunmen " in the years we studied , we did n't expect to see this many childhood injuries due to everyday gun violence , " @entity1 said			1
" and far too many of these were self - inflicted			0
" @entity83 was difficult to determine from the data -- some of the self - inflicted wounds were suicide , while others appeared accidental in nature			2
the bottom line , said @entity1 : children having access to guns			0
" no matter what side you are on in the gun debate , i 've never met a person that believes kids should have easy access to guns , " @entity1 said			1
" the data clearly shows this is a real public health concern for children			2
" overall , 6,920 youths were injured and cared for by these trauma centers between 2000 and 2008 , according to the research			1
of those , 129 had injuries from firearms , and those injuries were extremely serious compared with the others			2
of the gun injuries , 50.4 % required intensive care , compared with 19.3 % for other trauma - related injuries			1
some 13.2 % died , compared with the 1.7 % injured in another way			0
a total of 14 % of the gunshot wounds were coded as " self - inflicted			0
" once - unlikely win for gun control in @entity120 the research is a good and descriptive small - scale study , said @entity123 , an associate professor and co-director of the @entity125 , but it also is a good reminder that public health experts need to do more of this kind of research			1
" this study shows firearm injures are more likely to result in a death or a treatment in the @entity133 than other injuries , " he said			1
" that should make the case for how important it is to find ways to prevent those kinds of injuries from occurring			2
" historically , he argued , public health studies such as this one have led to positive changes			0
because people studied why car accidents happened in the 1960s , for instance , public health advocates knew how to improve injury rates from such crashes , @entity123 said			0
consequently , such injuries declined dramatically			0
" they did n't just try to make drivers safer or try to criminalize ( drunken ) driving -- that alone would n't have worked , " @entity123 said			0
" because we had the research , we also knew we had to make cars safer , make the environment safer , change the social norm to make it socially unacceptable to drive drunk			0
" all of this concerted effort was a public health success story , and it came about because we had the research			0
we have n't had the same robust research agenda on gun violence over the last two decades , and so we are not seeing the same dramatic decline in deaths and injuries			1
" how we can keep kids from shooting people @entity171 , @entity1 said , are available from trauma centers , but there is limited funding for studies			1
federal funding for gun research , however , is rare , outside of federal grants that are available to study other injuries			1
since 1996 , federal law has prohibited all @entity183 agencies , including the @entity184 and the @entity185 from using funds , " in whole or in part , to advocate or promote gun control			1
" the @entity189 pushed for the legislation , maintaining that government research into gun violence is unnecessary			1
" what works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others do n't have access to firearms , " @entity189 spokesman @entity200 told @entity0 in january , " not to carry out more studies			0
" how the @entity189 wields its influence a strongly worded editorial published in @entity204 in january called the federal government 's " neglect " of firearm injuries as a public health issue a " national shame			1
" it asked president @entity211 to " make a concerted effort to get the restrictive language about using federal funds ... out of future appropriations bills			2
" " if the @entity218 were to get serious about preventing firearms - related injuries and deaths , thousands of lives could be saved each year , " the authors wrote			0
" we can wait no longer to protect public health			0
" @entity1 said she wants her paper to inform today 's debate and inspire other projects			0
" we do know a lot more about how someone died of a heart attack than just how many people were injured by guns , " @entity1 said			0
" the data is out there ; we just need the funding to be able to do this kind of work , and then hopefully we can find ways to address this major public health problem			2
" doctors asked to participate in gun debate			0

a study of @entity120 trauma center data finds a high number of kids ' gun injuries
expert : more of this kind of research should be done
federal law prevents agencies from using funds to promote gun control
