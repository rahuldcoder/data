-- if you prefer your prose pulpy , hard - boiled as a country egg and darker than a midnight shade of noire , then you may be ready for some " @entity6			1
" the new page - turner from modern pulp master @entity10 ( pronounced sweer - @entity8 - ski ) hits bookstores tuesday			1
@entity10 is the author of several acclaimed crime thrillers , a regular contributor to @entity14 and has collaborated with @entity15 , the @entity16 mastermind behind tv 's " csi " on the series of best - selling , @entity21 26 " digi - novels			1
" his book reads like a @entity24 movie on speed , full of high - octane action , flying by at a breakneck pace , not for the faint of heart , but also with plenty of humor			0
" @entity6 " is the first book in a trilogy , about an unkillable ex-cop with a checkered past and a b - movie actress with a deadly secret			1
this pair of misfits is thrown together then hunted by a small army of mysterious hit men dubbed " the accident people			0
" while @entity10 hails from @entity45 , this book is set in @entity16 and takes advantage of a sunny locale loaded with shady people			1
the story starts with a white - knuckle car chase through the @entity51 , grabs readers by the scruff of the neck and refuses to let go for the next 304 pages			0
@entity0 talked to the author last week			1
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : what led you to start a trilogy ? @entity10 : " @entity6 " is about an alcoholic house sitter who , one sunny @entity63 morning , finds himself squared off against the most lethal killers in the world			1
it 's kind of a blend of " @entity68 " and " @entity69			2
" the only reason that it 's a trilogy is because i could n't quite kill off the house sitter , @entity73 , in one book			1
( he dies in the opening pages of the sequel , " @entity77			0
" ) ok , i 'm kidding about that			0
( or am i ? hmmm ... ) when i originally pitched my editor , @entity79 , i had a one - shot thriller in mind , but he asked if there was a way to build it into a bigger story			2
that 's the sick genius of @entity79 ; whatever you 're thinking , he 's thinking bigger			2
it 's inspiring , in a demented sort of way			2
@entity0 : who are " the accident people " ? @entity10 : i love books and movies about hit men			1
it just strikes me as the ideal job -- you set your own hours , you bring your own gear , you accept only the work you want			0
when i thought about the perfect hit team , it occurred to me that maybe they would have had experience in a different , yet related , field			0
i do n't want to spoil anything , so i 'll stop there ... but there 's a specific reason these guys operate out of @entity111 @entity0 : your novels have been described as high octane , brutal and smart but also with a sense of humor , sound accurate ? @entity10 : whoever said that is very kind , and i owe them money			1
but that 's certainly the target i 'm aiming for			2
if someone closes one of my novels before finishing , i consider it a failure			0
so i 'm doing everything in my power to keep those pages turning -- even if i have to resort to fireworks and tap - dancing			0
@entity0 : what led to your website , " @entity135 ? " @entity10 : my love of noir and pulp grew right out of my teenage love of horror fiction ( which i still love )			1
the best genre thrillers show people pushed to their extremes , and it 's fascinating to watch how characters deal with those extremes			2
@entity135 started as a way to share cool stuff with friends , then turned into a place where i can hang with readers and show them cool stuff			1
i do n't update it as often as i like ; @entity154 often robs me of my urge to blog			0
@entity0 : you 've also recently been involved in digi - novels and an e-story tie in to the " @entity160 " video game			1
will we see more of that ? @entity10 : absolutely			1
i 'll always be a sucker for new , shiny toys			0
i do n't want to write the same book endlessly and then die ; i 'd rather be known as the guy who tried as many different formats and subgenres as possible			0
even if some of those efforts are disasters			0
@entity0 : @entity45 features prominently in much of your writing , but " @entity6 " switches coasts			1
@entity10 : well , for better or worse , @entity45 is where my imagination goes to play			1
the more i travel , though , the more my imagination likes to hang out in other cities			0
this is how the @entity111 - set " @entity6 " came about ; the story just refused to take place anywhere else			1
@entity0 : what 's on your summer reading list ? @entity10 : such a great question , because i leave for a cross-country book tour / road trip in a few weeks , and i 've been obsessing about which books to pack			1
some of the definites : -- " @entity190 , " edited by @entity189 -- " @entity191 and the @entity192 , " by @entity193 -- " @entity194 , " by @entity195 -- " @entity196 , " by @entity197 -- " you 're next , " by @entity199 -- " @entity200 , " by @entity201 and @entity202 and a pile of comics and magazines and road atlases and travel guides			0
of course , the joy of being on the road is the opportunity to pick up more books from many fine idea shops across the country			0
i may have to ship my children home separately to make room for more books			0
@entity0 : what 's next ? @entity10 : my first issue of " @entity220 , " for @entity221 , will appear this september -- which is part of the companywide relaunch of every single title ( all with new @entity225 issues )			1
if you 're not familiar with the @entity220 , they 're an all - female covert ops team who operates out of @entity230 's @entity229			2
( i 'm giddy just typing that			0
) october brings " @entity77 , " the sequel to " @entity6			2
" and then in late december : " @entity235 , " my third @entity234 thriller with @entity15			2
it 's been kind of a crazy year , now that i think about it ...			0
