@entity0 , @entity1 -- smartphones can control drones , speeding robots , cameras and the temperature of your master bathroom			1
that 's just some of the technology on display in @entity0 this week at the annual @entity13			1
the massive show does n't kick off in earnest until tuesday , but some companies gave a sneak preview of their gadgets at the ces unveiled event sunday night			0
the technology at @entity21 tends to skew small and fun , and many products are from start - ups instead of major companies			1
a few are already available but most are scheduled to come out a bit later this year			0
among the usual headphones and speakers , we found some interesting gizmos			0
some might go mainstream , others will be copied by major companies , and some are just too strange or niche to make it outside of a select group of tech enthusiasts			0
racing robots smartphone - controlled toys are popular , especially the rugged rolling robots that show off by jumping , spinning and speeding around			1
@entity43 follows up its smartphone - controlled ball with the programmable @entity46 , an infrared - equipped two - wheeled robot that can go up to 14 feet per second and leap 3 to 4 feet into the air			1
the company behind the device , @entity51 , thinks people will use it in a variety of multiplayer smartphone games or for racing			1
also on display was the similar @entity56 from @entity57			0
the @entity56 can also go high into the air and speed and do tricks , and it includes a built - in camera			1
recreational drones tiny , medium and large drones are constantly buzzing through the @entity13 airspace			1
some , like the @entity64 , are just toys , meant to be controlled with smartphones and used to amaze or annoy your friends			1
the medium - size drones can be fun and also serve a purpose			1
@entity71 makes a line of professional and consumer drones for shooting video and taking photos			2
its newest product is the @entity78 , which has a built - in camera instead of the usual camera mount			2
you can see what the camera is seeing from a smartphone app while the drone is in the air			1
it also shares stats like telemetry data and warns you if the drone is too close to the 400 - foot maximum height allowed by law			2
the company also makes a version of the @entity78 without a camera , so you can mount something like your own @entity98 , and a hulking professional version that can carry a professional - size camera , like the @entity101			2
new kind of keyboard some of the best gadgets at @entity13 are the weirdest			1
the @entity106 keyboard from @entity107 takes the traditional computer keyboard , splits it , flips it and puts it on the back of a hand - held keyboard , where you will press them without looking			2
the device is meant to be ergonomic and a full - size alternative to the tiny on - screen keyboards found on most mobile devices			1
the company says that it 's easy to learn the new style of typing since the order of the letters is the same , and the front of the keyboard offers a light - up guide to help with the transition			2
the keyboard connects to mobile devices over @entity128 , but it can also be attached to the center of the keyboard with a suction mount			0
wearable sensors with flair using tiny sensors to track activity in watches , bracelets and other wearable doodads has been getting more mainstream			1
the next step is to make them something people actually want to be seen wearing			0
the early attempts are focusing on disguising the tech as familiar accessories			0
june is a uv sensor inside what looks like a sparkly piece of costume jewelry			2
the $ 99 fake gem attaches to a double - wrap leather bracelet or can be pinned to clothing			2
it tracks sun exposure , sunblock usage and other details and then churns out advice to keep the wearer from soaking in too many rays or burning			2
@entity160 attempts to make the usually sporty fitness tracker into a high - end - looking watch			1
also on a leather strap , the large square watch face is made out of hardy sapphire crystal and shows all the information in simple white lettering on black			0
it tracks heart rate , steps and fitness levels			2
it can sync to a smartphone but can also hold up to four months of data			0
the $ 320 watch will be available in april			0
power providers having enough power is an issue in developing countries , in emergencies and for anyone who needs to use a smartphone for more than half a day without recharging			0
a group of power - related gadgets attempts to address all the power problems on the spectrum			0
@entity188 is working with @entity189 on a hydrogen - powered fuel cell that will cost $ 199 when it launches in the @entity191 this spring			0
the device is able to charge a smartphone five times on a single cartridge , but the cartridges are swapped out at @entity189 locations			0
it 's not exactly off - the - grid living if you 're driving to the nearest strip mall to get a refill , but the device is also rolling out in @entity203 and @entity204 through cell carriers , which could have many more refill locations			0
the @entity208 chargers are solar powered and already used by 102,000 people in @entity210			0
the device got its start as a @entity213 project , and now the makers are hoping that sales in the @entity191 and @entity216 can help make the same devices more affordable in developing countries and areas hit by disasters			0
there 's also a @entity208 solar - powered light , and the company is working on a full emergency kit for the future			0
trackers , trackers everywhere tiny tracking devices are the hot , cheap product du jour			0
in addition to the fitness trackers , there are sensors for keeping track of your belongings , tracking your sleep patterns , and tracking air quality and temperature			1
one of the odder offerings we saw was @entity242 , a hub that looks like a happy ghost and works with up to 24 tiny sensors called cookies			1
the sensors can be placed on anything ( or anyone ) in the home and used to track their location , status or temperature			1
like many of the systems at @entity13 , @entity242 does n't play well with other systems and devices			1
@entity257 wants to track sleep with a sensor that slips under a mattress and a companion smart lamp and alarm , called the @entity264 , that tracks what part of the sleep cycle a person is in			1
when it 's time to get up , the @entity264 waits until the right part of the sleep cycle			0
while users are asleep , it generates special colored lights that the company says helps people generate melatonin			0
the device , which comes out in the spring , can also sense light levels and air quality .			1

new technology is previewed *ahead* of the @entity13 in @entity0
fun - sized drones and smartphone - controlled racing robots are popular
tiny sensors can be used to track fitness , sleep , air quality , uv rays and car key location
