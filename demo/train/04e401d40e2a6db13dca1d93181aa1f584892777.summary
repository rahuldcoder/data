-- the @entity2 ' dramatic rescue of @entity3 and @entity4 early wednesday ended the hostages ' three - month ordeal in @entity7			1
but why was it left to the @entity9 to conduct this operation in a country thousands of miles away ? the short answer is that the @entity9 has the military and intelligence capabilities to conduct the rescue of a @entity9 citizen in pressing need of medical attention			2
the longer answer is that @entity7 lacks the capacity to suppress piracy and other organized crime without international support			1
this is evidenced by the failed attempt of @entity7 forces to rescue a @entity29 family in march 2011 , where , as has so often been the case , local authorities found themselves outgunned by the organized criminals			2
there are no @entity7 agencies that can effectively fight piracy and other crimes in @entity7 , which has existed under a relatively impotent @entity37 since the central government collapsed in 1991			1
most of @entity7 is a patchwork of quasi-autonomous regions , across which neither governance nor law enforcement is coordinated			2
while most nations recognize the transitional government in @entity48 as the legitimate government of @entity7 , its reach is extremely limited			1
local administrations are thus left to manage issues of organized crime with little resources or support			0
the result : citizens exist in a precarious truce with a well - armed and organized criminal element			0
it is in this context of lawlessness that the @entity9 opted to take direct action to release these two hostages			1
but such heroic and high - profile moves , by the @entity9 or any other nation equipped for them , are not a long - term solution to @entity7 's plague of organized crime , now spilling across borders			1
to break this cycle of crime , the international community must step up its commitment to investing in @entity7 stability and addressing the symptoms of the nation 's governance vacuum			1
a recent report by the @entity80 estimated that $ 9 billion in humanitarian and development aid went into @entity7 over the past 20 years			1
this is a stark contrast to the billions that piracy costs the world each year			2
a forthcoming one @entity86 report finds that $ 7 billion was spent on measures to address @entity7 piracy alone in 2011			1
if the international community does not shift toward building sustainable @entity7 law enforcement capabilities at sea and ashore , the only realistic options to resolve hostage situations will continue to be through military action or ransom payments			1
among the ways money used to combat piracy is spent : 1			0
international navies support operations to patrol @entity7 waters and the @entity102 @entity101			1
nations fund suspect and prisoner transfer arrangements and " outsourcing " of prosecution within the region , as well as @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
( even more will be spent to incarcerate convicted pirates			0
the maritime industry spends billions on armed guards , extra insurance , " ship hardening " and re-routing			0
shipping companies pay expensive ransoms , if other measures fail			0
@entity7 criminal elements have proven themselves to be amazingly resilient and adaptable			2
and we can expect that this rescue may lead to an even greater escalation of violence and corresponding threats to innocent human life , including the estimated 190 hostages held ( one of whom is a recently captured @entity9 writer ) and the thousands of seafarers who continue to transit this dangerous area			1
indeed , the violence has been increasing as pirates confront private security teams and aggressive naval actions			0
they have changed their tactics to separate and conceal hostages and are re-investing ransom funds into criminal enterprises			0
gangs are also becoming more sophisticated			0
hostage takers now demonstrate a familiarity with international law that prohibits negotiation with international terrorist groups			0
groups labeled as terrorists simply sell their hostages to middlemen who can legally negotiate			0
yet there has been surprisingly little investment from the international maritime community in a sustainable solution , although for a brief time last fall it appeared there might be a ray of hope			2
when the radical @entity162 group , @entity161 withdrew from @entity48 in early fall 2011 , many saw this as an opportunity to reinvigorate efforts to stabilize @entity7			2
in september , key regional leaders from @entity7 adopted a " @entity171 " to improve security , the constitution , reconciliation and good governance			2
but with a fractured political system and roiling conflict between the country 's regions , implementation has been slow			0
now the world 's eyes are turning to a high - level conference to be convened by @entity181 prime minister @entity180 in @entity182 on february 23 aimed at tackling the root causes of the problems in @entity7 , including piracy			1
we can only hope that this conference will set the stage for a coordinated and forward - looking international effort that engages all the stakeholders in @entity7 and looks past the symptoms			1
join the conversation on @entity195			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity198 says @entity9 freed @entity7 pirate hostages because it had resources to do it
more *importantly* , he says , @entity7 did not ; pirates more powerful than weak government
he says world should aim aid at symptoms of piracy , not just spending to fight pirates
@entity198 : international effort must engage all stakeholders ; coming conference holds hope
