@entity0 -- the @entity2 wednesday proposed a $ 2.9 million fine against @entity4 for allegedly conducting more than 1,100 flights using planes with landing - gear doors that had not been repaired as prescribed by the @entity2			1
the proposed fine comes just weeks after the @entity2 proposed a $ 2.5 million fine against the airline for allegedly operating flights without adequately ensuring that the weight of baggage was properly calculated			1
the @entity15 , @entity14 - based @entity4 -- a regional affiliate of @entity16 -- flew four @entity18 regional jets on more than 1,100 flights between february and may 2008 , with main landing - gear doors that had not been repaired as ordered by the @entity2 in august 2006 , the @entity2 said			1
" following @entity23 [ repair orders ] is not optional , " @entity2 administrator @entity21 said in a statement			0
" the @entity2 does not hesitate to levy fines if maintenance standards are violated			0
" @entity4 responded that it was disappointed in the @entity2 's actions , saying the airline did not endanger the public and it considered a fine unwarranted			2
the repair order required airlines to inspect landing - gear doors and take necessary action , fixing the doors or replacing them with new ones			2
in this case , @entity4 found damage on four aircraft , but rather than removing the doors as required , the airline repaired them while they remained on the planes			0
@entity4 said it self - disclosed to the @entity2 that repairs were performed while the landing - gear doors remained on the aircraft , a process that the @entity2 and the aircraft manufacturer subsequently approved , the company said			1
@entity4 subsequently removed the landing - gear doors on each of the affected aircraft and repaired them in accordance with the @entity23			2
the airline said it will meet with the @entity2 to discuss the matter			0
the proposed fines are the latest in a string of multimillion dollar fines the @entity2 has proposed against airlines for failing to follow repair orders			0
in october , the @entity2 proposed to fine @entity58 $ 5.4 million and united $ 3.8 million for other maintenance violations			1
in march , @entity60 agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to settle a complaint that it flew unsafe planes .			0

@entity2 seeks $ 2.9 million from @entity14 - based regional affiliate of @entity16
@entity2 : aircraft with *bad* repairs on landing gear doors used on more than 1,100 flights
