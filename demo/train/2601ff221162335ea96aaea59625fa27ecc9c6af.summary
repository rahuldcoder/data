the 2014 @entity1 induction ceremony thursday celebrated some of the industry 's greatest legends the best way it knew how : by turning up the music			1
along with the typical acceptance speeches at the 2014 event were some performances so awe - inspiring one of them kept going long after the show was done			1
held in @entity16 's @entity15 , the @entity14 welcomed six new members : @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 ( now known as @entity21 ) , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity23 was the first to take the stage on thursday , performing his cut " digging in the dirt " from 1992 's " @entity27			1
" he then brought out @entity29 's @entity28 -- who gave @entity23 's induction speech -- to duet with him on " @entity31 , " followed by a performance of " @entity33 " with @entity35 musician @entity34			1
perhaps @entity23 helped set a mood of kindness and peace , because when all four original members of @entity19 took the stage there was n't a trace of their famous animosity to be seen			1
inducted by @entity44 -- a known @entity19 fan who crowed that " @entity19 was never a critics ' band			2
@entity19 was a people 's band ! " -- @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 seemed sincere when they accepted their honor			0
" this is a profound moment for all of us			0
we are humbled that the fans gave us the chance to do what we love doing , " @entity48 said			2
" and so i 'm here just to say a few kind words about the four knuckleheads who , 40 years ago , got together and decided to put together the band that you see on stage , critics be damned			0
... we would n't be here today without the initial @entity66			0
" there was n't a performance from @entity19 , but there were plenty more to look forward to : @entity21 gave a rendition of " @entity71 " accompanied by an acoustic guitar , @entity20 performed classics like " @entity74 , " and the @entity75 took on " @entity76 " and " @entity77 " after receiving the @entity78 for musical excellence from none other than the @entity81 himself			1
" i thank you my beautiful men and women of @entity75 , " @entity81 said in a speech that dug back to the group 's very beginning			2
" you made me dream and love bigger than i could have ever without you			0
and tonight i stand here with just one regret : that ( the late ) @entity92 ( @entity93 ) and @entity94 ( @entity95 ) could n't be with us here tonight			0
" and then , there was the tribute to @entity18 , eerily timed to come within days of the 20th anniversary of @entity101 's death			1
@entity103 's @entity102 inducted the landmark rock group , calling them " singular , loud and melodic and deeply original			2
... @entity18 defined a moment , a movement for outsiders , from the fags and the fat girls to the shy nerds and the goth kids in @entity112 and @entity113 , for the rockers to the awkward to the too - smart kids and the bullied			1
" that community included @entity101 's widow , @entity118 , who was subdued thursday when she took the stage to accept the recognition along with @entity121 , @entity122 and members of @entity101 's family , including his mother			2
" he would have been so proud , " @entity101 's mother , @entity126 , said of her son			0
" he 'd say he was n't , but he would be			0
" while some may have been expecting @entity118 to embrace her love - ness and deliver one of the most talked about moments of the night , she was focused on family			0
" i have a big speech , but i 'm not going to say it			0
... this is my family i 'm looking at right now , " she said , as she pushed past her tension with @entity121 to walk over to him and give him a hug			0
" i just wish @entity101 was here to see this , " she concluded			0
for their performance , @entity18 recruited some top talent , from @entity146 to @entity147 to @entity148 , to help them light a fire with " @entity150 " and " all @entity151			1
" according to @entity153 , their collaboration continued into the early hours of friday morning as @entity18 , joined by @entity154 , @entity146 and @entity147 , headed over to a secret show .			1
