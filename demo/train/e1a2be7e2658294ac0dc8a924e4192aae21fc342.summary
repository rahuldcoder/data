director and actor @entity0 once said , " if you want a happy ending , that depends , of course , on where you stop your story			0
" of course , the story of @entity9 and the movement it 's sparking across the nation is just beginning to be written			1
but those watching it unfold , especially those of us who are sympathetic to the movement , are eager to know how it might end			1
will politicians start paying more attention to people instead of profits ? will the " 99 % " persuade the " 1 % " to be more compassionate ? will the protests spawn a new generation of engaged citizens , the " flower power " for the 21st century ? if the occupations are n't forcibly ended by authorities , how will they stay visible in our easily distracted society ? and how will the protesters stay warm and dry ? when i asked @entity9 organizer @entity34 about the possible endgame of the movement , he replied , " that 's a dumb question			1
the movement is n't yet 3 weeks old			2
as a culture , we have a short attention span ; we 're too inclined to see everything as a sitcom and want to fast - forward to the end			0
@entity34 was being a bit evasive			0
critics of @entity9 may demand to know the agenda -- the ending -- of the movement , but perhaps its ongoing victory is that its story is even being told			1
@entity54 had become shockingly complacent in the face of outrageous inequality and injustice , seeming to defend the special rights of yacht - owning " job creators " while swallowing the notion that millions of our fellow citizens can be both working and poor			1
one poster at @entity9 read , " @entity65 has been turned off			1
" that we 're now having a public debate about inequality and the ugly road to nowhere on which many hardworking @entity54 are traveling suggests that , whatever @entity9 's ultimate agenda , the process of movement building -- the fact of its existence -- may be its essential point			1
social movements spring up not to achieve narrow policy goals but to shift the broader public debate , mobilizing public will toward change			0
polls show this movement 's message against corporate greed not only has wider support than either political party in @entity88 but wider support than the tea party			2
" occupy " protests are springing up in unlikely places , from @entity93 to @entity94 , and drawing unlikely protesters like soccer moms , small - business owners and , yes , tea party members			2
that you 're even reading this column is evidence the protests are making a mark			0
even if the 99 % movement -- as it 's coming to be known in some quarters -- fizzles in the coming months , historically it may be the spark that lights another flame that ultimately leads to change			2
just as interest on a bank account multiplies and compounds over time , so does outrage and resistance			0
like any good story , the 99 % movement is bound to have a cliffhanger , though it 's too soon to predict when or what it will be			2
but expect it to come in the form of a significant demand that , if achieved , would dramatically transform our politics and economy for the better			2
based on my conversations with participants at @entity9 , my sense is that the ultimate demand could be a radical reform to get money out of politics			1
this might be a call for public financing of elections , new restrictions on lobbying contributions			0
there might even be a constitutional amendment saying the law should not treat corporations as people , effectively overturning the @entity145 's @entity144 ruling that allowing corporations and wealthy donors to spend more freely on campaigns			0
incidentally , the @entity54 people widely support such campaign finance restrictions , but both @entity151 and @entity152 are chronically unwilling to forsake cash cow corporations and embrace reform			1
creating huge public pressure to get corrupting money out of politics would be quite a happy ending for the protesters -- and our democracy			2
but even if ordinary @entity54 merely become more awake to the injustices of gaping inequality , if they now begin to fight back , then it wo n't matter where the story ends			1
in the face of economic travail -- with 16 million @entity54 children living in poverty and with unemployment for african - americans at more than double the already - alarming rate for white people -- the 99 % are finally standing up together and taking action			1
this foreshadows a much brighter future all of us			0
" meaningful change does n't happen overnight , " @entity9 organizer @entity179 told me			1
" we are n't talking end game now			0
we 're just getting started			0
" yet organizers seem to realize the point is n't how their story ends but how long they can keep it going , growing public consciousness and building pressure for change			0
" at this time , " @entity179 said , " we are only interested in impossible demands			0

@entity192 says @entity9 in early stages , but many are eager to know outcome
she says its existence is already victory over @entity54 ' long *season* of complacency
she predicts that the movement will result in a demand for real economic redress of some kind
@entity192 : protesters may seek campaign finance reforms ; that they are finally awake is enough
