@entity0 , @entity1 -- vice president @entity3 and rep. @entity4 , @entity7 presidential candidate @entity6 's running mate , will share the stage in @entity0 , @entity1 , in their only debate			1
@entity3 and @entity4 's debate follows the top of the tickets ' first of three debates last week , in which @entity15 turned in a lackluster performance , upstaged by an aggressive and vibrant @entity6			1
here are five things to watch for on thursday night : 1			0
will @entity3 go where @entity15 did n't ? @entity3 is not shy on the campaign trail ; the day after last week 's first presidential debate , the vice president attacked @entity7 nominee @entity6 in a way that many @entity23 had wished president @entity15 would have done the night before			1
@entity24 : @entity3 debate no game - changer , but could shift momentum how aggressive will @entity3 be in going after the man at the top of the @entity7 ticket rather than the man he 'll share the debate stage with ? will @entity3 highlight the " 47 % " controversy , @entity33 and @entity6 's tax returns ? " the vice president likes laying out the contrast between the @entity39 extreme agenda and the plans he and the president have to move this country forward and we fully expect that to continue thursday night , " an @entity15 campaign official told @entity2			1
with the polls tightening both nationally and in key battleground states after last week 's debate , the stakes for the showdown between the running mates have increased			2
7 questions you would ask at the vp debate " @entity3 needs to play offense , not defense , " said @entity23 strategist and @entity2 contributor @entity55 , who is a senior adviser for a pro-obama super pac			2
" attack the @entity39 plan to cut taxes for the rich and raise them on the middle class			0
dissect the @entity39 plan to end @entity63 as we know it			0
point out that if @entity6 had been president , @entity65 would be alive and @entity66 would be dead			0
and be prepared to body - slam @entity4 when -- not if -- he fibs			2
the wonk trap @entity4 likes to call himself " a numbers guy			1
" indeed , wonky budget talk is @entity4 's calling card			1
it 's the primary reason he has captured the hearts of conservative elites in @entity75 , who see him as the second coming of @entity78			0
@entity4 's debate prep as meticulous as he is but fiscal wonkery was quicksand for @entity15 during last week 's debate			1
his dreary reliance on budget math over pointed political arguments contrasted sharply with @entity6 , who presented his ideas with vigor and clarity , despite obvious questions about the factual underpinnings of his ideas			0
can @entity4 avoid getting bogged down in the arithmetic that so thrills him ? an adviser to the @entity7 vice presidential nominee told @entity95 's @entity94 this week that @entity4 " may be over-preparing " for his showdown with @entity3			1
by some accounts , @entity4 has bristled at platitude - driven demands of the campaign trail			2
he 'd rather be talking substance , on the road with a @entity103 presentation about @entity63 costs			0
the challenge for @entity4 on thursday , though , is to present the @entity6 vision to millions of voters without sounding too much like the @entity108 think tank staffer he once was			2
he 's done a solid job of that since @entity6 put him on the @entity7 ticket in august			1
now , on the biggest stage of his career , he has to abandon some of the @entity116 tendencies that made him a star in the first place			0
@entity4 has n't called @entity119 for advice 3			2
@entity121 put @entity122 in play ? in the @entity124 , @entity4 has backed moving @entity122 funds to private investment accounts as a way to make the popular entitlement program more solvent			1
@entity4 's past proposals would seem to tee up what 's usually a winning political argument for @entity23 : that the @entity7 ticket wants to gut @entity122 to help their old pals on @entity134			1
but to the bewilderment of @entity23 strategists , @entity15 appeared to take the issue off the table in the first debate			2
" i suspect that on @entity122 , we 've got a somewhat similar position , " @entity15 said			1
" @entity122 is structurally sound			2
it 's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by @entity144 and @entity23 speaker @entity145			0
but it is , the basic structure is sound			0
" @entity148 : @entity122 , where @entity15 and @entity6 stand the @entity15 campaign scrambled to clarify last week that yes , in fact , the two candidates have fundamentally different views on @entity122			1
" the choice is clear : president @entity15 will never privatize @entity122 or undermine retirement security for middle - class @entity159 , " read a post on the @entity15 campaign website that went up after the debate			1
" the same can not be said for @entity6			0
" will @entity3 try to score fresh points by raising the issue of @entity122 privatization against @entity4 ? or did the president already holster one of his party 's most effective political attacks ? 4			1
the age gap " i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent 's youth and inexperience			1
" so went @entity144 's famous line in one of his 1984 debates against @entity23 challenger @entity177			0
will @entity3 have a similar quip ready on thursday ? ok , @entity3 is not nearly as old as @entity144 , who was 73 at the time of his re-election			2
but at 69 , he has almost three decades on @entity4 , his 42 - year - old debate opponent			1
how @entity4 sharpens debate skills @entity3 is also known for his exuberance and devilish charm , so perhaps the age gap wo n't be as apparent as it was in 2008 , when 47 - year - old @entity15 shared a stage with 72 - year - old @entity187			1
or as it was in 1988 , when 67 - year - old @entity189 debated his boyish vice presidential foe @entity190			0
stylistically , their birthdays might not matter much			0
but the age difference neatly crystallizes the arguments being presented by both campaigns			0
will voters choose experience and decide to move forward on the path we 're on ? or will they look to a pair of fresh - faced outsiders who offer a new direction ? 5			0
@entity4 's role as commander in chief just as @entity6 needed to prove last week that he 's acceptable to @entity159 to serve as president , @entity4 needs to convey that he 's ready to fill in as president in case something happens to @entity6			1
it 's one of the top tasks for the challenger 's running mate in a vice presidential debate			0
we 'll be keeping a close watch on @entity4 to see if he touts his ability to step in , if needed , to the leading role			2
the @entity6 campaign is confident that the congressman from @entity220 will pass the test , thanks to @entity4 's position as @entity124 budget chairman and his mastery of complex fiscal issues			1
" it will come down to his competency on the issues , his command of the issues , " a @entity6 campaign official told @entity2			0
but @entity232 strategist and @entity2 contributor @entity232 thinks that this time around , passing the competency test is not as important			0
" there is very little pressure for either of these vice presidential candidates to prove they are ready to step into the office of president			0
both their bosses are relatively young and in great health , " @entity232 said			0
opinion : @entity3 must deliver for @entity244 what questions would you ask the vp candidates ? share with us on @entity249			2

will @entity3 use the issues @entity15 avoided last week to take the fight to @entity4 ?
can " numbers guy " @entity4 avoid the fiscal wonkery quicksand that sank @entity15 last week ?
will @entity3 argue or avoid his ticket 's differences with the @entity7 on @entity122 ?
almost three decades apart , will the age gap between @entity4 and @entity3 be a factor ?
