-- for most @entity2 , energy policy right now is all about gasoline prices			1
and given the political claims and counterclaims on this issue being tossed about , it 's no wonder that the public is both skeptical and confused			2
@entity9 charge that the president is responsible for higher prices at the pump , and a certain @entity9 presidential hopeful has even been so bold as to promise a return to $ 2.50 a gallon gasoline			1
how can the average @entity2 , already feeling the impact of higher prices , filter through the nonsense and noise ? critics of the administration are quick to note that when @entity23 took office , gasoline prices were $ 1.95 a gallon			1
but they neglect to note the @entity2 economy was in a virtual depression			0
for purposes of comparison , when president @entity29 took office in 2001 , gasoline sold for an average of $ 1.55 a gallon			1
in the summer of 2008 , his last year in office , prices exceeded $ 4.25			1
in reality , presidents have little to do with near - term fluctuations in gas prices			1
earlier this year , closures of refineries announced in the @entity2 and elsewhere began pushing up gasoline prices well in advance of the coming " driving season			2
" more recent increases are more closely tied to the delicate balance between increased demand growth and concerns related to supply disruptions , including but not limited to concern over @entity53			0
the single largest component in the price of gasoline is the cost of crude oil			1
@entity66 , state and local taxes as well as refining costs , transportation , retail advertising and the cost of the service station lease also figure in			0
all things being equal , for gas to cost $ 2.50 a gallon , the crude oil price would have to be in the $ 50 - a - barrel range ( less than half of the current price )			1
and to achieve this anytime soon would likely require a global economic collapse			2
with oil at $ 50 - a - barrel it would not be economically viable for oil companies to bear the cost of extracting oil locked up in hard - to - reach places such as the deep ocean or oil sands , where much of the new production is found			1
such a price reduction would , in any event , be short - lived , as demand would grow with lower prices while supply languished			2
for the longer term , the president 's goal of doubling fuel economy standards and increasing fuel choices makes eminent good sense : it would make $ 4 gasoline feel like $ 2 gas to consumers			1
also a very good thing			0
@entity9 charge that the president has impeded domestic oil production , while @entity103 are quick to note that production is at its highest level in years			0
here , the facts are on the president 's side , as @entity2 oil production is at its highest level since 2003 and imports are below 46 %			2
this is truly good news			0
nonetheless , the nit - pickers are quick to point out that much of the recent development has been the result of technology improvements on the part of industry and is largely occurring on private , not federal lands			0
the domestic oil and gas industry has been the source of enormous and valuable technology , innovation , tax and royalty revenues , and new jobs			2
but production is also up on federal lands as well			0
critics claim that if the president had been more aggressive in promoting domestic development of oil and gas and increasing development acreage over the past three years , domestic production would be significantly higher and gas prices would thus be substantially lower			1
this assertion is false for a couple of reasons			0
the @entity141 ( for which the president bore no responsibility ) necessarily curtailed @entity2 offshore production for the better part of a year			0
additionally , exploration and production of green field projects take time -- several years , in fact -- and even modest increases on the order of several hundred thousand barrels per day in a 90 - million - barrel - per - day world would not guarantee significantly lower prices at the pump			1
the president has recently characterized the latest iteration of his energy strategy as an " all of the above " approach , albeit with a continued emphasis on lower carbon sources			2
this seems to have struck a raw nerve with industry activists and political opponents , even though in 2007 the @entity166 -- and more recently , @entity9 proposals -- reached the same conclusions			0
similarly , @entity23 's language emphasizing the need for responsible development mirrors exactly what the industry said in a 2011 @entity166 study and is consistent with the findings produced by secretary @entity176 's @entity175 with respect to shale gas development			1
thoughtful debate here may be falling victim to politics and pique			0
sloganeering and political infighting should not drive our energy debate when there are real challenges to be addressed			0
the bottom line is that we are all in this together			0
regardless of your political affiliation , if the nation does well , we are all the better for it			0
so let 's try to find some common ground to advance economic , energy and environmental goals where the opportunities present themselves and stop the petty bickering and finger - pointing			1
the @entity2 people deserve better			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 and @entity206 .			1

@entity205 and @entity206 say politics has sown confusion on high gas prices
the authors say presidents have little to do with spiking gas prices
for $ 2.50 a gallon gas , crude oil would be $ 50 a barrel , likely *due* to global collapse , they say
*writers* : @entity23 's " all - of - the - above " energy approach makes sense ; finger - pointing does *n't*
