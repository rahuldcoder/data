-- with horrors emerging from @entity4 's civil war with numbing regularity , it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that the uprising has not been waged only with guns			1
a creative and resolutely non-violent form of opposition to @entity13 's regime has taken hold in @entity4 , as the country 's artists respond to the crisis with newfound boldness and purpose , despite the clear dangers in doing so			1
" since the uprising , the artists have broken through the wall of fear in @entity4 and are thinking in another way , " said @entity4 journalist @entity22 , one of the curators of an exhibition on @entity4 's creative dissent -- culture in @entity32 -- currently on display in @entity34			1
" the uprising has changed the artists ' thinking about the task of art in society , how they can do something useful for society , " said @entity22			1
" they have rewritten everything			0
" with works spanning from painting to song to cartoons , puppet theater to graffiti to plays , the exhibition traces the way that @entity4 artists have used a range of creative techniques within traditional and new media to create political , populist art that that both brooks " the red line " of dissent and engages the public in unprecedented ways			1
the regime is well aware of the power of visual images and art to mobilize public opinion , says @entity22			2
after all , the uprising began when schoolchildren in @entity70 were arrested for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school last year			2
" from the beginning the regime has known it 's dangerous to use the image , to use art , " said @entity22			1
" the camera is the equal of any weapon from the point of view of the regime			0
" a dangerous calling all of which has made producing political art dangerous , sometimes mortally so			1
@entity85 , a fireman and part - time poet from @entity87 , wrote popular @entity89 songs that were sung demonstrations , most notably a number called " time to leave			0
" last july , his body was found dumped in a river with his throat cut out , vocal cords removed			1
a pen - and - ink portrait of the mutilated singer by artist @entity97 is featured in the exhibition , while @entity85 's song is played in a section the curators call the " @entity102			1

the distinguished political cartoonist @entity110 had his first piece published in a newspaper when he was 12 , produced a daily editorial cartoon for the official newspaper throughout the 1970s , and had direct contact with @entity13 throughout the early days of his presidency			1
" i remember when he first walked into my exhibition at a cultural centre -- a tall dude with a large entourage			2
he asked me how he could access what the people were thinking and i told him to just talk to them , " @entity110 said , in an interview printed in the exhibition 's catalog			1
@entity110 's cartoons had typically used symbols , and rarely depicted identifiable political figures			1
but three months before the uprising began , hoping to inspire others , he resolved to take a more strident approach			2
writing a call to arms on his website -- " we have to break the barrier of fear that is 50 years old " -- he began drawing senior regime figures , before breaking the final taboo by depicting @entity13 himself			2
" it was a decision that took a lot of guts , but i felt it was time			0
no one could take their corruption anymore , " he said			0
in august 2011 , he said he was abducted by gunmen and brutally assaulted , his attackers focusing their violence on his hands			2
@entity110 has left the @entity4 to recuperate , but like many others in his position , has vowed to continue working and to return to his country			1
" i just started drawing after healing , " he said			0
" after i was assaulted and my hands were broken , someone asked me : could i still find the courage to draw ? i told them i had been ashamed by the suffering of 13 - year - old @entity163			1
i am humbled by the culture and heart of people who can not draw or write but who are sacrificing their lives for freedom			0
" a technological revolution not only are the artists of the @entity4 uprising expressing political views more boldly than before , but they are employing new technologies to bring those works to a broader audience , engaging the public with art in an unprecedented way			1
before the uprising , said @entity22 , art tended to be the preserve of only a relatively small circle of urban @entity4			1
" but since , we have had a new kind of cultural production -- new songs , new theater , new cinema , new posters that make links between the artistic and the ordinary life of the people			0
most of artists are concerned with what happens in the street : checkpoints , the daily life of the people under tough conditions			2
" read also : tourists take @entity202 " pray - cations " @entity4 has poor internet infrastructure -- although this is changing slowly -- while censors have typically been wary of social media sites , according to press freedom organization , @entity208			1
but under @entity13 , the regime had been increasing its visibility on the web			0
in february 2011 , shortly before the uprising began , @entity212 was unblocked , and before that @entity13 and @entity215 , @entity214 had their own pages on the site			2
according to @entity22 , @entity212 and social media sites like it provided activists with a powerful medium for distributing subversive images			0
one piece of resistance art which has thrived on the internet , gaining hundreds of thousands of views online , is the daring satirical puppet show @entity228 : diaries of a @entity230 , created by the 10 - member artists ' collective @entity231			2
the leader of group -- drawn from theater , art , film - making and journalism backgrounds -- said he settled on finger puppets for their depiction of @entity13 and his regime because they were easy to smuggle through checkpoints , and because doing so removed the " godlike aura " around @entity13			0
" he 's a puppet ; you can carry him in your hand , " the group 's anonymous director , @entity245 , told curators			0
" you can break him			0
you can actually deal with everything that is scary with laughter			0
" @entity4 have begun referring to @entity13 using the name of @entity228 's diminutive dictator , @entity256 , he added			1
" it 's peaceful , effective protest			2
" @entity4 explained : what you need to know documentary through art for other artists , their work has also played an important role in documenting a conflict that has largely been shielded from the world 's media by the regime			1
@entity97 , the painter , illustrator and video artist behind the portrait of @entity85 , believes the relative absence of journalists in @entity4 makes it incumbent on artists to capture the unfolding events			1
" we saw hundreds of thousands of professionally taken photographs of the @entity106 revolution , " he told curators			0
" as artists , we should make something that not only reflects on the ( @entity4 ) revolution right now , but make something that will last two generations from now			1
" the uprising " is n't just a people standing up to their government , to the regime ; it is a revolution with many aspects : an artistic revolution and a social one as well , " he said			0
" significantly , you can see people trying to introduce sensitive ideas to the public ; and it seems they are receptive , which itself is a sign of social change			0
" @entity303 is the director of the @entity304 , the @entity306 culture funding body behind the exhibition			0
she said the exhibition , which runs at the @entity309 until late november and is curated by @entity310 , @entity22 , @entity311 and @entity312 , was attracting interest from galleries around the world wanting to represent @entity4 artists			1
the exhibition " really gives a different picture to what is going on , in addition to what we see on television , " she said			0
" which is of course also a reality , but this is a reality -- a very important one			0
" attendees are often surprised by the diversity of the work being produced , and by the humorous , subversive tone of many artists , she said			0
" it is very difficult for civilian artists and activists right now who want to work non-violently while there is so much violence going on , " she added			0
" yet there 's a large dose of humor , notwithstanding the situation			0
they say they have moved beyond fear			2
