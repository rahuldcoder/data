@entity0 -- the @entity3 's former point man on security in @entity5 told a congressional hearing wednesday that his superiors worked against him as he tried to get more help for the @entity10 diplomatic mission in @entity11 in the months before it was overrun in a deadly terror attack			1
@entity13 , the one - time regional security officer , told the @entity14 that he had a disheartening conversation with the regional director of the agency 's @entity17 when he requested additional manpower for the facility			1
" i said , ' @entity22 , you know what makes it most frustrating about this assignment ? it 's not the hardships			0
it 's not the gunfire			0
it 's not the threats			0
it 's dealing and fighting against the people , programs , and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me , " @entity13 said			2
he also told the @entity3 officer , " ' for me , the @entity38 is on the inside of the building			0
" that bombshell ended a contentious hearing during which two @entity3 officials defended the @entity46 administration 's handling of the september 11 attack that killed ambassador @entity48 and three other @entity10			1
what we know about the @entity5 attack @entity11 has become a flashpoint in the presidential campaign with @entity55 @entity54 saying the attack illustrates that president @entity46 's policies have made @entity10 less influential and more vulnerable around the world			1
under secretary of state for management @entity59 responded to suggestions the @entity3 was responsible for a lack of preparedness			0
" we regularly assess risk and resource allocation , a process involving the considered judgments of experienced professionals on the ground and in @entity0 , using the best available information , " @entity59 said			0
the assault on the @entity10 compound was " an unprecedented attack by dozens of heavily armed men , " @entity59 said			1
his colleague , deputy assistant secretary of state for international programs @entity76 , added that the @entity3 " had the correct number of assets in @entity11 at the time , " drawing a sharp rebuke from committee chairman rep. @entity81 , @entity83			1
" to start off by saying you had the correct number , and our ambassador and three other individuals are dead , and people are in the hospital recovering because it only took moments to breach that facility somehow does n't seem to ring true to the @entity10 people , " @entity81 said			1
@entity55 committee members and the @entity3 officials went back and forth about the appropriate number of people needed to provide security at the vulnerable @entity11 location			1
various communications dating back nearly a year asked for anywhere from three to five diplomatic security special agents			0
as the four - hour hearing drew to a close , @entity103 divulged he had verbally asked for significantly more help -- 12 agents -- but the officer from the @entity17 had rebuffed his request			2
" his response to that was , ' you 're asking for the sun , moon , and the stars , ' " @entity13 said			0
that attitude made the @entity11 incident predictable , according to @entity103 , who left @entity5 in july and continues to work at the @entity3 for diplomatic security			1
" for me and my staff , it was abundantly clear that we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident			0
and the question that we were to ask again is , ' how thin does the ice have to get before someone falls through ? ' " five special agents were in @entity11 at the time of the attack , @entity81 said			1
two of them only happened to be there only because they had traveled with @entity48 from @entity138 , @entity134 said			0
" the post had agreed that three was a sufficient number to have on the ground			0
but lt. col. @entity142 , a @entity143 who was a site security commander in @entity5 from february through august , testified that the regional security officer -- it was unclear if he was talking about @entity103 -- tried to obtain additional personnel , but " was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with			1
" " the security in @entity11 was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there , " @entity142 said			1
" diplomatic security remained weak			0
in april , there was only one @entity10 diplomatic security agent there			1
" @entity10 official sought more security for @entity11 post @entity3 officials also responded to allegations by @entity55 that the @entity46 administration intentionally misled the public about the cause of the attack			1
critics accuse the administration of trying to cover up or play down the attack through initial statements that described it as a spontaneous act stemming from protests over an @entity173 film rather than a planned terrorist assault			2
" we have always made clear that we are giving the best information we have at the time			0
and that information has evolved , " @entity59 said , citing remarks by @entity179 ambassador @entity178 on september 16 that critics alleged were deceptive			2
" for example , if any administration official , including any career official , were on television on sunday , september 16 , they would have said what ambassador @entity187 said			2
the information she had at that point from the intelligence community is the same that i had at that point			0
clearly , we know more about today than what we did			0
" while congressmen from both parties agreed that security at overseas @entity10 diplomatic posts is crucial , and they expressed hope for a bipartisan solution , several times during the hearing the dialogue devolved into rancorous comments back and forth			1
the assault in @entity11 occurred 11 years to the day after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity208 's @entity207 and the @entity209			1
@entity59 said the fullest picture of proper security and procedures will not be fully clear until a review board appointed by secretary of state @entity214 and including former @entity216 chairman adm. @entity215 is completed			0
@entity3 officials : @entity11 attack ' unprecedented ' @entity220 had accused @entity81 of planning a partisan , election - year hearing , a similar allegation leveled against the panel for its past investigations of the botched " @entity228 " gun - running program and the failed @entity226 clean energy company that received government loan guarantees			1
on tuesday , two senior @entity3 officials provided reporters with the most detailed explanation yet of the attack in @entity11 , saying on a conference call that there was no prior indication such an assault was imminent			2
the officials , who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name , said there was " nothing unusual " throughout the day of the attack			0
what @entity46 administration has said about @entity5 attack @entity48 held an evening meeting with a @entity248 diplomat and then retired to his room in one of the compound 's buildings at 9 p.m. , according to the officials			1
the first sign of a problem came 40 minutes later , when diplomatic security agents heard loud talking outside the compound , along with gunfire and explosions			0
asked whether the attack was a spontaneous assault taking advantage of a demonstration , as originally asserted by @entity46 administration officials , one senior official said , " that was not our conclusion			1
" the two senior officials offered riveting detail of the attack by what one of them described as " dozens of armed men " who marauded from building to building and later fired mortars on a @entity10 annex less than a mile away			2
in the havoc at the four - building compound , @entity48 and two of his security personnel took refuge in a fortified room that the attackers were able to penetrate , one official said			0
the attackers doused the building with diesel fuel and set it ablaze and the three men decided to leave the safe haven and move to a bathroom to be able to breathe , according to the official			0
@entity48 became separated from the security personnel in the chaos and smoke , and eventually turned up at a @entity11 hospital , where he was declared dead			2
@entity54 knew @entity297 slain in @entity11 @entity1 's @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report .			2
