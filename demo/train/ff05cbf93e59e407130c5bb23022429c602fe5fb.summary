-- following a trend set by other carriers , @entity1 has begun sending @entity5 warning messages to the top 5 % of data users on its network			1
the message alerts consumers that they are among @entity1 's top 5 % that billing period , and suggests they use @entity13 to avoid reduced data speeds in the future			1
although it 's a pain to those affected , @entity1 is being transparent about the issue , giving subscribers a chance to minimize their usage before getting their data speeds choked			2
@entity24 began throttling users who consume a large amount of data , but did n't initially reveal the policy to the public , describe how it would be implemented or describe if and how users would be notified			2
it should be noted , however , that @entity1 was the first carrier to introduce the tiered data plan structure to customers , setting the trend for other carriers to follow suit thereafter			1
@entity1 did away with its unlimited data plan shortly after the @entity38 debuted last summer , replacing it with a tiered data structure			1
currently , the most robust data option is a $ 25 per month 2 gb plan that allows you to go over that limit for $ 10 per extra gb. @entity1 confirmed it would throttle the data speeds of the heaviest users on its network in late july			1
@entity24 has a similar policy			0
the carrier will reduce data speeds " periodically for the remainder of your then current and immediately following billing cycle " if you fall within the top 5 percent of heavy data users			2
this is done in order to " ensure high quality network performance " for other users , especially in times and locations where there 's peak demand			0
according to a developer forum , @entity24 will call and then send a letter to users who are about to get their data speeds throttled			2
@entity24 eliminated its unlimited data plan in july and now offers 2 gb for $ 30/month , 5 gb for $ 50 monthly and 10 gb for $ 80 monthly			1
@entity70 offers an unlimited data plan that costs $ 100 per month , but throttles users who exceed 5 gb in a single billing cycle			1
that leaves @entity75 as the only carrier that still offers an unlimited data plan without any kind of throttling ( unlimited data and minutes for $ 100/month ) , but the carrier does tack on a $ 10 " @entity84 " fee for smartphone owners			1
@entity75 is rumored to begin carrying the @entity38 this year , which would make it the only carrier to allow users an unlimited data plan with the popular phone			1
business analyst and @entity90 was one of the recipients of @entity1 's recent round of @entity5 alerts			0
he used between 11 and 12 gb of data this month , but normally averages around 6 gb to 7 gb. @entity90 thinks that @entity1 's throttling policy reduces the utility of his smartphone , since he has to think twice about how he uses his phone			2
" what is the point of a @entity103 app if we do n't have the back - end to fully support it ? " @entity90 says			0
" the tiered data plan is in the right direction , but then do n't throttle your users			1
let them use what they pay for at the speeds that they paid for			0
" another @entity90 , @entity115 , amassed a similar level of data this billing period and received an sms warning			0
@entity115 said that he reached the 11 gb mark by listening to podcasts and @entity122 on his commute to work			0
a @entity126 poll of 11,000 data plan subscribers showed that 73 % use less than 2 gb of data each month			2
consumer reports similarly found that the average @entity38 user only gobbles 273 @entity130 of data each month			0
so right now , the throttling issue is generally only affecting a small number of users			0
as the use of cloud storage and streaming music and video services becomes more widespread , the issue of these data caps and speed throttling is likely to get more heated			0
