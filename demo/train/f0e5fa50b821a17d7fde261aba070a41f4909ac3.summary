the @entity1 migrants accused of the murder of two @entity4 tourists on the @entity6 resort island of @entity7 have retracted their confessions , according to @entity1 media			1
following a visit from a consular lawyer , the two men , @entity11 and @entity13 , say that they made their statements admitting to killing @entity15 and raping and murdering @entity17 , under duress			2
the two men have been in police custody since october 1 and confessed shortly after that			1
the murder of the @entity4 tourists occurred on september 15			2
the bodies were found partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads			0
a hoe with blood on it was found close by , police said			2
@entity30 , a lawyer attached to the @entity1 embassy , visited the accused and later reported that one of the @entity1 migrants had only admitted the crime after being beaten by the police and threatened with electrocution			1
@entity1 , a former colony which gained independence from @entity4 in 1962 , is also known by its colonial name , @entity1			1
calls to the @entity6 police force , and the @entity1 embassy in @entity41 , by @entity42 went unanswered thursday			1
torture denied the revelation comes a day after the national police chief held a press conference denying that the police had extracted the confessions through use of torture , the @entity44 reported			1
the @entity6 newspaper quoted @entity30 as saying , " " they told me that they were on the beach that night drinking and singing songs			0
" they said they did n't do it , that the @entity6 police [ along with their @entity1 - @entity6 translator ] beat them until they confessed to something they did n't do			1
they 're pleading with the @entity1 government to look into the case and find out the truth			1
they were a really pitiful sight			0
their bodies had all sorts of bruises			0
i have already reported all that i have seen today to my government			0
" @entity78 called upon @entity6 police to launch a full , independent investigation into reports that the police have been using force to extract information from migrant workers from the neighboring country in connection with the investigation			1
allegations of torture should be investigated independently , and not by the @entity6 police , @entity89 , @entity78 's @entity90 director , told @entity42			1
he also said there were questions of due process that had arisen , specifically the absence of legal counsel prior to the confession , and difficulties with interpretation			0
" there is a fairly long - standing record of ill - treatment , " in @entity6 , he said			0
" impunity is also a problem			0
if the investigation shows ill - treatment , those responsible should pay			2
" the fact that the suspects are migrant workers , many of whom work in @entity6 illegally , makes them more vulnerable , @entity89 added			2
calls to the @entity6 police force , and the @entity1 embassy in @entity41 , by @entity42 went unanswered thursday			1
police commissioner gen. @entity115 had previously told @entity42 that dna in semen taken from @entity17 matched samples taken from the two men			2
" the dna matching result is out already and they matched with dna found on the female victim , " he said			0
but @entity89 said that regardless of the outcome , and despite the high profile nature of the case , proper procedure should be followed to allow justice to be properly served			0
" we do n't take a position on their guilt , " he said			0
" it is a horrendous crime , and involved @entity4 young people so there is tremendous pressure to get a conviction but this should n't be a reason to cut corners			0
