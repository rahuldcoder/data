-- as @entity7 pundits watch the carnage in @entity9 , images of a rapacious @entity3 president @entity2 , puppet master of @entity4 and of its president , @entity5 , stalk the headlines			1
@entity2 , the theory goes , is willing to stoke a civil war in order to keep @entity4 from turning to the @entity14			1
@entity16 's obsession with @entity2 , however , does not explain the complex realities fueling the uprising in @entity4 or the uneasy relationship between @entity2 and @entity5			1
long before the uprising began , if @entity5 had carried out real economic and political reform , he would not have been caught between a long - term promise of a closer relationship with @entity23 and an immediate hand - out from @entity25 and with it the @entity27 's demand that he toughen up and put down the opposition 's demonstrations			1
but @entity5 , up for re-election in 2015 , was not willing to bite the bullet and carry out the measures the @entity14 was demanding			1
@entity5 tried to play both sides against the middle			2
" @entity5 has played @entity2 against @entity23 and the @entity16 quite masterfully			1
so there is no love lost between them and no trust there , " says @entity35 , who , until this month , served as @entity16 national intelligence officer for @entity3 and @entity37 at the @entity38			0
he 's now director of the @entity3 and @entity44 at the @entity45			0
" the quality of the discussion here in @entity7 has really been appalling , " he adds			0
" a lot more has been said about @entity3 and @entity3 's role ... but it ignores the fact that @entity4 has had an independent life for the last 25 years , and this crisis is really a domestic political crisis in @entity4			1
not that the @entity3 have n't helped , but it is a @entity4 domestic political crisis			1
" opinion : can @entity4 sustain fragile peace ? @entity2 does have interests in @entity4 : a desire to keep @entity60 and @entity16 military bases out , ties with @entity4 aircraft and shipbuilding enterprises closely linked with @entity3 's military - industrial complex , his own @entity66 , in @entity4 's port of @entity68 on the @entity70 peninsula , as well as ensuring unimpeded transit of natural gas to @entity23			1
what 's more , @entity74 's @entity73 says , @entity2 and his advisers essentially see @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity77 as one people and " therefore , seek to draw @entity4 into @entity25 's orbit			1
" " the size of @entity4 's population and , to a less extent , of its economy would make it a valuable asset in the @entity86 , which @entity2 is building in the @entity89 landscape			1
" @entity5 , however , " has never been @entity3 's man , " says @entity90 , director of the @entity91			2
" i think it 's a myth			0
he 's been a very difficult partner for @entity3 , a very unreliable partner , someone who let the @entity3 down on many occasions			0
someone absolutely not to be trusted			0
" @entity5 's only goal is to stay in power and to protect his wealth and the wealth of his family , says @entity90			2
" with @entity5 vacillating between @entity3 and @entity23 and always having his own private interests in mind , it 's mind - boggling			2
so the @entity3 have long given up on @entity5			2
" @entity2 's envoy to @entity9 refused to sign the latest truce between @entity5 and the opposition , in which they agreed on early elections and a return to a constitution that would shift more power from the president to the @entity116			1
" i think the @entity27 feels cold - shouldered , " @entity90 says			0
" i think it feels betrayed by @entity5			2
betrayed may be too strong a word , but certainly @entity5 has managed to play the @entity23 off the @entity3			2
" @entity2 is not rubbing his hands in glee at the prospect of an epic battle with the @entity14 over @entity4			1
in fact , says @entity45 's @entity128 , who worked on policy toward the region in the @entity132 and @entity133 administrations , " i think if you 're sitting in the @entity27 the prospect of a @entity125 scenario in @entity4 is quite scary			2
" " as much as the political narrative in @entity7 and the @entity14 is that @entity2 , the puppet master , has guided all of this , " he says , " i think there 's reason to believe that he 's more worried and more cautious about how dangerous this is			1
he 's set a policy framework which , obviously , has made the situation worse but at the same time , the really scary stuff that 's out there as possibilities , i think , scares the @entity27 no less than it scares @entity23 and @entity16			0
" @entity128 calls it a " four - way political fiasco " involving the @entity4 , the @entity23 , the @entity3 and the @entity16 , where " people did n't want to get engaged in the early stages of the conflict and events were quickly hijacked by politicians and self - interested actors on the ground			2
" the partnership agreement , in which the @entity156 offered @entity4 eventual economic and political cooperation , was too long - term to solve @entity4 's immediate financial problems			1
@entity3 , angered by the move , stepped in to offer $ 15 billion			0
in the @entity162 narrative , that is depicted as " blackmail , " but if the @entity3 president , angered by @entity5 's deal with the opposition , does not follow through with aid for @entity4 , then the ball will be back in the court of the @entity16 and @entity23 , " who are not willing to dig deep in their pockets like the @entity27 has , " @entity128 says			1
the @entity5 government must pay back more than $ 15 billion in debt payments to creditors over the next two years			0
and without @entity3 's money , the @entity16 and the @entity86 would be forced to come up with some form of emergency support			0
" i do n't believe there 's any receptivity in @entity181 or @entity7 to do a major financial bailout for the @entity4 government , " @entity128 says , " which has a terrible track record on economic reform , a completely unsustainable currency peg , and its long track record of cozy deals for tycoons			1
" clan struggles among @entity4 's oligarchs , social and political crisis , regional differences between western and eastern parts of the country -- @entity4 's home - grown problems are deepening , even without meddling by @entity2			1
" what we see in @entity4 is , unfortunately , in the 20 years of independence , @entity4 leaders have done little or nothing to create a single @entity4 nation , " says @entity90 , " and the divisions within @entity4 have persisted and they have also become much more pronounced in the last few months			0
" keeping @entity4 together is a priority for the @entity207 administration but , says @entity90 , it 's also a @entity3 policy priority			2
" despite what you may hear from various @entity3 figures , " he says , " it 's very much mr. @entity2 's preference , in fact , priority , that @entity4 stays in one piece			1
otherwise , a civil war very close to home , next door , essentially , could be too dangerous for @entity3 itself			0
" @entity3 would fight to protect the ethnic @entity3 population and @entity25 's base in @entity70 , says @entity74 's @entity224 , quoting a senior @entity3 government official who told the @entity226 , " if @entity4 breaks apart , it will trigger a war			2
... they will lose @entity70 first ( because ) we will go in and protect ( it ) , just as we did in @entity231			0
" @entity232 is n't so sure			0
" i do n't think the @entity3 are about to invade @entity70 , " he says			0
" what i think is more likely is that , in the future , the various regions of @entity4 will present their own claims and may go in different directions on a number of issues			0
and attempts by @entity9 to clamp down on those autonomous or regionalist tendencies could lead to a new spike in tensions in @entity4			0
" @entity9 is burning , and @entity4 is unraveling			0
@entity5 -- or the leader of a new government -- will have to find a new way to keep the country together			0
@entity2 will not simply stand by and watch it happen , but he is not the puppet master of @entity5 -- or of @entity4			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			0

@entity252 : the popular image is that @entity2 is manipulating the @entity4 crisis
she says reality is that @entity5 is to blame for *avoiding* economic , political reform
the *turmoil* in @entity4 is a major *headache* for @entity2 's regime , she says
@entity252 : @entity2 not eager for an epic battle with the @entity14 over @entity4
