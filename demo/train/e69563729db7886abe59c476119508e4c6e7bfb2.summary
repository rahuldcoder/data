-- what a difference a @entity1 makes			0
last weekend " @entity11 " inspired @entity3 to a seven - goal victory on the opening day of the @entity7 soccer season , but in his absence sunday the reigning champions battled to beat @entity10 1 - 0			1
with the four - time world player of the year rested after suffering a bruised thigh in the midweek @entity15 draw with @entity16 , new coach @entity12 stuck to his word and left $ 75 million signing @entity18 on the substitutes ' bench			0
and without a recognized striker , @entity3 struggled to make the team 's usual dominance of possession pay off -- the winner at @entity10 came courtesy of a superb curling shot by defender @entity28 from outside the penalty area			1
@entity18 did get another run , but the 21 - year - old @entity32 star was unable to repeat his goal against @entity16 as he was subjected to a series of rough challenges -- and had a late free - kick well - saved			2
earlier , @entity38 's free - kick was deflected against the @entity10 crossbar , but @entity3 ultimately had keeper @entity40 to thank -- as well as the woodwork			1
@entity43 scrambled a shot that rebounded to safety off the post , then @entity42 headed straight at @entity47 when he should have equalized			0
the win left @entity3 top of the table on goal difference from @entity16 , despite the @entity16 side 's 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity54 earlier sunday			1
@entity55 scored in each half while @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 also netted in a perfect warm - up for wednesday 's trip to the @entity62 for the second leg of the @entity15			0
@entity64 can also move onto six points by beating @entity66 on monday , ahead of the expected unveiling of @entity68 forward @entity69 in what is tipped to be a world - record transfer fee			0
@entity72 recovered from last week 's drubbing by @entity3 , holding @entity74 0 - 0 , while @entity76 @entity75 beat @entity76 2 - 1 in sunday 's late match despite having @entity78 sent off near the end			1
in @entity81 , @entity80 beat @entity82 2 - 0 in @entity84 's first match in charge , with @entity87 defender @entity86 and @entity88 forward @entity89 scoring in the final 20 minutes			1
" we must remember that these lads had gone four and a half months without winning at home , and there were lots of defeats in there too , " former @entity97 coach @entity84 said , referring to the disastrous form which left @entity80 ninth in the table last season and well short of @entity103 qualification			2
" we needed to shake off this fear that we 'd concede on the first counter-attack			0
the players just needed a bit of belief			0
" @entity97 's new coach @entity109 also had a winning start as last season 's runners - up beat @entity113 3 - 0 , with two goals from @entity116 playmaker @entity115 and the opener from former @entity64 forward @entity118			1
@entity120 coach @entity119 was similarly successful in his first match with @entity122 , coming away from promoted @entity123 with a 2 - 0 win thanks to second - half goals from @entity126 and @entity127			1
@entity128 , fifth in the previous campaign , bounced back from last weekend 's 4 - 0 @entity131 defeat by @entity132 to beat @entity133 2 - 1			1
in @entity120 , champions @entity134 won for the first time this season , beating @entity138 2 - 1 following two earlier draws			0
@entity139 , an $ 84 million signing from @entity97 , put @entity134 ahead in the first half before an own - goal by defender @entity143 , but @entity144 pounced for a 74th - minute winner after @entity147 ' shot was blocked on the line			2
the result left @entity151 's team four points behind top side @entity153 and two behind second - placed @entity156			0
in @entity158 , @entity157 notched a first win this season , 2 - 0 at @entity161 which left the promoted side bottom of the table without a point			2
@entity166 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity167 left the five - time @entity169 champions also on three losses .			0

sunday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity10 keeps @entity3 top of @entity174
defender @entity28 scores only goal in absence of @entity1
@entity16 also on six points after 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity54
winning starts in @entity81 for new coaches at @entity80 , @entity97 and @entity122
