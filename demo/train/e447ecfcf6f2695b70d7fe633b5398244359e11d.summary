@entity0 , @entity1 -- at every corner and every stoplight in this town some 15 miles southeast of @entity6 , the signs staked in the ground have one message : " homes ready now			1
" @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 -- each subdivision off @entity15 has new homes or ready - to - build plans , priced from the $ 180,000s to the $ 300,000s			1
construction and for - sale signs are part of the scenery			1
everybody here is new to @entity1 census tract 203.17 , one of the fastest - growing places in the fastest - growing county in one of the fastest - growing states			1
the tract is a slender strip between @entity33 and @entity34 roads , bordered for four miles on the east by @entity15 , and power lines to the west			1
the @entity38 estimates there were 499 people on this sliver of @entity42 in 2000			1
ten years later , it counted 5,353 , an increase of more than 970 %			1
tracts are designed for @entity38 counts and usually contain 2,500 to 8,000 residents ; one tract might cover an entire county in a rural area or a few blocks in a packed city			1
tract 203.17 is new , a narrow section carved from a space that was bigger and less populated 10 years earlier			1
the new subdivisions in 203.17 are filled with people from @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and nearby @entity6			1
they cling to their favored traditions of home and ditch what 's less convenient			2
residents sip sweet tea while they wait for @entity68 - style pizza			1
few have lived here long enough to have allegiances in the @entity70 versus @entity72 rivalry , but many pay for big tv packages that will broadcast the sports teams they grew up with			1
they like what this place is selling : granite countertops , two - car garages , fresh sod , wide sidewalks and ever - higher numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms			2
better still , it 's got easy access to the city , mild weather , good schools and low taxes , just 14.5 cents on every $ 100 for most residents in 203.17			1
but there are questions they 're all trying to answer			2
when do you stop being a @entity58 , a @entity59 or a michigander , and start being a @entity1 ? if we 're all new here , who are we at all ? @entity100 @entity1 's population exploded in the last 10 years , especially around @entity6 's booming ( then busting ) financial industry			1
" we 're it , " said @entity103 , a professor at the @entity70 's @entity104 and director of the @entity107 's @entity106			2
" we are the cat 's demographic meow			2
we are a real migration magnet			2
" " gargantuan homes , " @entity103 said , are the hallmark of western @entity42 in the last decade , when wheat , corn and soybean fields finally yielded to subdivisions and @entity119 @entity118 traffic			2
most of tract 203.17 lies within the city of @entity0			1
the town was incorporated in 1907 but was little more than a stopping point between @entity6 and the @entity126 , @entity127			2
" in the late ' 60s , maybe early ' 70s , when i was kind of a kid , it was just a little pit stop , " said @entity128 , a @entity42 - raised resident of tract 203.17			1
" there was a little par three golf course			2
it had a little train depot 50 or 100 years ago			1
" it still has a golf course , but the city has long outgrown " nothing much			2
" @entity0 's census count jumped from 1,942 in 1990 to 33,518 in 2010			1
last year , for the first time , the city 's population edged out county seat 's by 721 residents			1
@entity128 , 56 , returned to @entity42 in 2005 after retiring from a military career that moved him through 15 states			2
his parents had stayed in @entity42 , and taxes on @entity128 's home in @entity153 , @entity58 , were uncomfortably high			2
@entity128 and his wife settled in to the @entity11 subdivision -- the heart of tract 203.17 -- and by 2007 , he 'd been elected to the @entity158			1
as the rare @entity1 native in town , people look to him for history , background and explanations of this place they 've all chosen			1
neighbors laugh about their accents , most of them different and almost none of them a @entity172 drawl			2
families here attend churches , or synagogues , or mosques			2
in the @entity178 , 36 of the 499 people in 203.17 identified themselves as @entity180 , 10 as @entity181 and six as black			1
among the 5,353 counted in 2010 , there were 584 latinos , @entity184 and 803 blacks			2
@entity128 said he sometimes looks around and wonders what the people here can possibly share			2
everybody comes from a different place , with different values , traditions and ideas about the best way to live			2
but then , there 's a reason everybody found this place			2
" no matter how different i think i may be , " @entity128 said , " everybody 's got something in common : they moved here			2
" @entity15 on a sunny saturday afternoon , just inside a subdivision entrance off @entity15 , the sidewalks are strewn with bikes and strollers			0
cars are constantly pulling over to trade 50 cents for a plastic cup of lemonade			0
the neighbors laugh at the ice cream truck playing @entity212 tunes			0
parents here all seem to remember childhoods when dozens of kids ruled tidy suburban streets			0
moms and dad say these new sidewalks look more like their memories than the aged or empty ones they left behind			0
several said they 've convinced their parents , brothers , sisters and friends to move down to @entity0 , some of them close enough to be in the same census tract			1
it 'll never be @entity230 , but when your mom moves down the street and the bagel shop opens for business , you can start to convince yourself that this is home			0
@entity239 was , as neighborhoods sprung up , @entity0 did n't keep up , @entity158 members said			1
residents referred to themselves not by their city or county , but by the name of their subdivision -- " i 'm from @entity11 , " or " we live in @entity247			1
" a couple of years ago , sensing that people did n't identify with the place as a whole , they paid a company to create a logo and motto for the city : " @entity257			1
" next , they tried to build places where people really could get together beyond school gyms and grocery store aisles			0
" people are moving here now and they 're saying ' where are the restaurants ? where 's the entertainment ? where 's the parks , the services ? ' " said @entity0 town manager @entity268 , who moved to @entity0 from @entity60			1
he 's got the delicate task of deciding what this population of thousands should handle for itself , what it should contract out , and how to pay for it			1
that means they 're inventing public works in the city , but still paying for outside police protection			0
existing services are stretched to the limit -- but they 'd happily make room to build a few clothing stores or a @entity286			0
in 2010 , @entity42 residents voted to start allowing alcohol sales , and @entity0 just opened its first package store			1
to nobody 's surprise , but some people 's disappointment , business is great			0
several new residents said they like the new grocery stores and the new @entity297 , but a family - friendly , sit - down bar and restaurant would be a huge get			1
@entity303 then , the town has its new amphitheater and community space , @entity306			0
they organized the first concert there , and swiftly experienced their first rainout			0
but people came back the next week for a bluegrass - themed evening			0
kids ran around with temporary tattoos that read " i ( heart ) it			0
" it felt like something big had happened			0
" people were really longing for a sense of identity			1
it was a large town , but there was n't anything that that said ' @entity0 , ' " said @entity323 , a @entity158 member who moved from @entity230 to a subdivision inside tract 203.17			1
" you ca n't always identify exactly what it is , but you know it when you see it , ' this is home			0
' " @entity337 farther down @entity15 , the area stops looking like a community - wide open house			0
there are a few new houses , but more with peeling paint , crumbling foundations and tangled front - yard gardens			0
in the farthest reaches of tract 203.17 , mostly outside the @entity0 city limits , there are no official logos or branded street names			1
@entity351 and her husband , @entity352 , first moved to their 5 - acre lot on @entity337 more than 30 years ago			1
since then , they 've had their own kids , adopted more kids , added grandkids , a couple dozen goats , miniature horses , pet pigs and a three - legged toy dog			0
she likes having a @entity364 and entertainment a little closer to home			0
with more money flowing into the county , she believes the school system only gets better , and in a more diverse class , the kids are introduced to more points of view			0
but there 's much to miss about the old , less cluttered 203.17 : an even quicker commute to work in @entity6 , on roads empty of traffic and noise			1
the neighborly belief that a pig roast is a party , not a fire hazard			0
kids that can toddle around without shirts or shoes			0
horses and chickens grazing and pecking wherever they please , without fear of becoming a petting zoo			0
skinny - dipping in the pond across the road			0
green fields , green grass , green trees			0
first - name greetings at the store			0
knowledge of who needs a prayer and who can offer one up			0
while others were finding themselves here , she felt like she was losing herself			0
" i 'm no longer a person , " @entity351 said			0
" i 'm just a number on the road			0
" but home is wherever her children are , all of ' em , the ones she birthed and the ones she took in when their first homes failed them			0
it 's wherever her husband can dr. @entity417 all the sick and broken animals that find their way to their yard			0
" @entity423 's home , " she said			0
" she 's already got another place picked out , miles away from 203.17			1
it 's just across the @entity427 state line , on 15 undisturbed acres on a dead - end road			0
like all her new neighbors , she thinks maybe she can build a new home some place else			0
