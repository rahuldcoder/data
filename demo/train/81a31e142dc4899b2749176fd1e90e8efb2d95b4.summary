-- @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity1 analyzes the fallout from the publication of tens of thousands of @entity6 military and diplomatic reports about @entity7 by whistleblower website @entity8			1
q : what do these documents tell us about the war in @entity7 ? a : it 's more detail than we 've ever seen before about the war			1
the newspapers -- the @entity18 , the @entity19 in the @entity20 and others -- have had access to the documents for several weeks and have had the chance to do the most digging			2
what they 've been able to do -- and this is just the tip of the iceberg because nobody has had time top go through all 92,000 of them -- is to make a comparison with some of these individual documents and then the information and reporting that came out in the subsequent days after those documents were filed			1
what they 're able to show is that there is sometimes a discrepancy , or there is sometimes some very revealing information			0
so it 's in those small details that you really see how the war is being played out			1
that 's what @entity8 boss @entity49 wants to do			2
he wants to put that out in the public domain			2
q : so what have we learned that we did n't know before ? a : i think what we 're hearing here is what a lot of people have suspected about many situations			0
for instance , this allegation that the @entity65 intelligence service -- the @entity64 -- has been supporting the @entity66 fighting @entity6 troops in @entity7			1
we 've known for a long time that @entity65 sees huge importance in having a government that supports it in @entity7			1
they fear @entity73 on the other side of the border and therefore they want a friendly government on the other side of the country			0
these are things that have been discussed before and that 's the tone of what you are seeing			0
these are things that have been suspected ; now you have some factual evidence about them			0
q : just how sensitive is this information ? a : all of these documents that we 're seeing at the moment are , at their most sensitive , " secret , " as opposed to " top secret			0
" some of them do say " not for foreign eyes , " so perhaps there is an indication there that they 're not for coalition partners inside @entity7			2
so they 're clearly very sensitive , but not at the most senior level			0
q : how damaging are these documents to the @entity6 - led war effort in @entity7 ? a : they 're absolutely damaging , the military says , because it puts troops in harm 's way , it gives away factual details about how troops operate ; for instance , the fact @entity6 troops know heat - seeking surface - to - air missiles are being used against them is something they did n't want to put in the @entity66 's domain			1
they say the @entity66 will use this against @entity6 troops , they will look at all the analysis and they will use that to their advantage in the field ; they will use these details of civilian casualties in their own propaganda			1
of course , the people who are putting this out are saying : " look , if you 're going to fight a war everyone really needs to know the details of what is happening			0
" we are learning here details of things that we have n't found out and would n't have been able to find out on the ground			0
it is revealing information and it is only when you can go through all of these documents that you can really fit it all together into a bigger analysis and really frame it , rather than just seeing this snapshot that we 're getting so far .			2
