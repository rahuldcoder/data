-- when it comes to rock ' n ' roll on the radio today -- outside the ghetto of rock - only stations --- to paraphrase punk patriarch @entity7 , there 's almost nothing going down at all			1
take a look at the @entity11 singles charts in 2011			2
the only relatively new artists to successfully cross over from the rock and alternative rock charts to the @entity15 have been @entity16 and @entity17 , and the ubiquitous genre - buster @entity19 has gone the other direction			1
as radio has become more stratified , the @entity22 format appears to have marginalized rock , focusing on tempo - driven pop , r&b , dance music and hip - hop			1
it 's like 1989 to 1991 all over again , when the likes of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 dominated the airwaves and the charts			1
twenty years ago , two little - known @entity38 - based bands released albums that would change the music industry , both commercially and artistically			1
@entity42 's debut " ten " came first			1
but that now - revered album , full of weighty anthems , took several months to gain traction			1
a few weeks later , @entity46 released its second album , " nevermind , " a disc rife with noise , but also verse - chorus - verse pop structures			1
it quickly burned up the charts behind its lead single , " @entity52			2
" @entity46 had just finished a two - week tour of @entity54 , opening for the underground trailblazers @entity56			1
filmmaker @entity57 documented the tour , then returned home with his film			2
soon , he realized his movie , " 1991 : the @entity63 " ( which was released on dvd on september 13 ) , was going to have an adjusted focus			2
" every day , we 'd come into the editing room ( and say ) , ' oh , yeah			2
@entity46 sold another million overnight , ' " @entity57 recalls			1
" it was just surreal			2
it was also very exciting , because for the first time , something from my end of the world -- you know , something from the left - of - the - dial end of the world that was previously relegated to college radio ( made it big )			1
" the success of @entity46 and the " grunge " movement helped open the doors for hundreds of other " alternative " ( as " college radio " was re-named ) acts			1
in reality , none of those definitions told the listener much about the bands that rode the wave to commercial and / or critical acclaim in the early to mid- ' 90s			2
some artists , such as the @entity91 and @entity92 , sounded a lot like those heard on classic rock stations			2
other bands brought some variety to radio			0
without " nevermind , " commercial radio stations probably may not have played the singles from underground veterans like @entity102 or @entity104 's heroes the @entity105			1
while many rock bands and " movements " have garnered critical acclaim over the intervening two decades , commercial success is harder to come by , as radio is locking rock out of the mainstream again , says @entity113 , @entity11 's director of charts			1
" you look at the top of the rock chart , and you see all kinds of bands who have had @entity22 radio hits , from @entity122 and @entity123 and @entity124 , " he said			0
" you think there 'd be an appetite for @entity124 , and some stations are playing it , do n't get me wrong			0
but on a national level , it 's hard ... to get these stations to get these songs on the chart , " he says			1
" it 's just not in the lexicon of @entity22 now			1
@entity22 has moved on away from those acts			1
and it 's going to be a challenge to get it back			1
" part of that challenge is today 's fractured media landscape			1
in september 1991 , the @entity140 , satellite radio , digital downloads , ipods and tablets were n't factors			0
@entity146 , @entity147 ' senior vice president of promotions , helped @entity19 and @entity17 break through earlier this year			1
@entity146 started in the industry in the late ' 80s working in a record store before he moved on to a gig at @entity151			0
he says success is measured differently now , and every band has a different view of what success means			0
" a big touring base , " @entity146 said			0
" merchandise that you sell			0
but i think building a community , building a following , building a groundswell			0
... there 's just so many things to measure now			1
" " you 've got to consider them all right now , " he continued			0
" anything gold or platinum in the past used to be a success			0
getting a gold record nowadays is very tough			0
selling half a million records , albums , is one of the toughest things			0
the bar is a lot higher now			0
" the bands that broke through in ' 91 built communities the old - fashioned way : touring nonstop and mixing with fans in and out of clubs			1
a lot of those artists , including @entity46 , were influenced by the ' 80s post-punk and hardcore scenes that filmmaker @entity57 was part of			1
he said bands such as @entity56 had created benchmarks for success in that culture : a few hundred thousand units sold , airplay on @entity199 's 120 minutes and headlining their own tour			1
@entity146 said getting close to fans is still part of the equation for artist development , but in 2011 , that includes an online component			0
" if ( a new artist ) has 200,000 @entity210 friends , and he goes on tour for the next six months without a record , doing his own grass roots , selling his own cds , putting them up when he needs to , doing his own videos , and the next thing you know , you 're at 400,000 , you have a better chance when you do launch an album , " he reflected			1
" you already have that audience			0
that tribe 's already built in			2
they 're already lined up			0
they 're ready to go			0
all you have to do is ignite them			0
" @entity46 ignited an audience that did n't even know it was flammable in 1991 , and no one -- even those close to the band -- foresaw that spontaneous combustion			1
" it was n't like anything that was planned			0
i do n't think any great things that happen in culture and music are			0
it 's obviously something people see and respond to			2
you know , i think that record was in the right place at the right time , combined with being a great record and great songs , " @entity57 said			0
he 's skeptical about anyone replicating @entity46 's success			1
" the music business has changed so much , and i do n't think it will happen in that 20th century way			0
" the odds at the time were still incredibly far for what happened for them			0
it 's like the perfect storm			2
" it may have been the perfect storm for @entity46			1
but just like weather cycles such as @entity256 , the music industry tends to repeat its trends			0
" it would n't be surprising if you called us back in a year from now , or a year - and - a - half from now , and suddenly , there 's a whole lot more rock acts on our charts , because everything is cyclical , " said @entity258 , @entity11 's associate director of charts			1
" right now , we 're in a very dance - pop phase , just as we were in that time in the ' 90s where everything was @entity270 and @entity271			1
and then in the 2000 thing , @entity273 and @entity274			0
and now , we 're in this @entity276 , @entity273 - again era			2
" @entity146 agreed , with one caveat			0
" music is cyclical and it does change , " he said			0
" i do believe there will be another movement			2
it 's starting to happen already			2
will it ever achieve the numbers that it used to have ? no. it just wo n't , because it is a bit too fragmented			0
but i still think great music rises to the top			0
" " it 's hard to predict when , but it seems like every decade , there 's that bang			2
and you know what ? you just wait for it , and you hope to be a part of it ... as a music lover			0

@entity46 and the " grunge " movement helped open doors for hundreds of " alternative " acts
@entity46 's second album , " nevermind , " has a verse - chorus - verse pop structure
@entity42 's debut " ten , " full of weighty anthems , took several months to gain traction
