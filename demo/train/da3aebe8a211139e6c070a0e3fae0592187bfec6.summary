" @entity22 's @entity21 in the @entity23 , " read the main headline in the @entity18 section of @entity20 's @entity19			1
however , the @entity20 team 's domination of @entity26 to reach the quarter finals of @entity28 stole the top spot on its national homepage early monday , " third game , third victory , " the headline cried			1
with an election of its own on the weekend , @entity34 's @entity33 devoted its monday morning homepage to a breakdown of a parliamentary vote tipped to solidify the majority of president @entity41 's @entity40			2
@entity2 @entity43 leader hails ' victory for all @entity22 ' however , the @entity2 vote led the international sections of both @entity20 and @entity34 sites , and dominated headlines in the @entity49			1
never known to underplay a headline , @entity49 's @entity52 newspaper told it straight : " @entity2 votes to keep the euro ( just ) ... and save rest of @entity22			1
" the @entity56 pitched the win for the @entity58 as a victory for the euro -- " voters give single currency a chance " -- while at the same time the paper 's economics editor argued that what was really needed was international action			1
" the situation in the eurozone , and around the globe , was catastrophic before sunday 's second @entity2 election			1
the result changes little , " @entity72 wrote			0
however , he added that anyone expecting @entity77 members to come up with any effective coordinated response to the crisis " obviously has n't been paying attention			0

@entity49 's @entity126 injected a sense of urgency into power - sharing talks , " @entity2 election stalemate creates race against time to form coalition government ... as pro-bailout parties struggle to reach agreement that could save the euro , " the headline screamed			1
the @entity130 adopted a more relaxed tone , announcing that the election results had calmed fears of a @entity2 exit from the eurozone			2
@entity103 also looked calm as he beamed from the front page of @entity138 daily @entity137 , which highlighted the relief which met the @entity2 election outcome			1
however the website 's most - read story at the time of writing was about a rare image of a bee sting in motion			0

@entity2 vote lifts @entity151 markets the @entity2 result also led papers in @entity154			1
under the headline " @entity2 is not an exact science , " @entity155 , the country 's leading daily , questioned why so much @entity22 relief has been expressed when the results were roughly the same as the first election in may			1
the threat of a @entity2 exit from the eurozone persisted , the article said			0
with the headline " @entity103 seeks ' national salvation ' coalition , " the main story on the english - language @entity168 said the race was now on to form coalition to secure @entity2 's place in the eurozone			2
the article made mention of the " unprecedented pressure tactics by the @entity20 and @entity22 political establishment in the run up to the elections			1
" " @entity20 officials repeatedly declared that careful implementation of the bailout deal is the necessary condition for continued loans , " it said			2
to prove the point , the website reproduced an open letter by @entity20 newspaper @entity191 which reminded @entity2 voters who was bankrolling their atms			1
" your atms continue to give you euros , only because we put them there , the @entity20 and the other nations that have the euro , " the @entity191 letter read			0
