-- a federal appeals court has denied @entity4 gov. @entity3 's request for an expedited hearing on the state 's controversial immigration law			1
instead , the case has been scheduled for a hearing during the first week in november			1
@entity3 had wanted public oral arguments in the case for mid-september			1
the @entity12 had urged a slower schedule , and the 9th @entity14 agreed in a brief order issued friday evening			0
@entity4 filed its appeal thursday , asking the court to lift @entity20 district judge @entity19 's preliminary injunction on the immigration law			1
@entity22 's ruling wednesday temporarily blocked some of the most controversial provisions of the law , known as @entity26 , including the requirement that police officers check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws			2
@entity22 also blocked provisions of the law making it a crime for people to fail to apply for or carry " alien registration papers " or " for an unauthorized alien to solicit , apply for , or perform work , " as well as a provision " authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person " if there is reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation			2
the parts of the law that took effect thursday include a ban on so - called " sanctuary cities " -- municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants			1
the judge also allowed a provision in the law that makes it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic			0
the parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants also withstood the first legal test			1
@entity0 senior legal analyst @entity65 said the ruling reflects the government 's argument that immigration enforcement should be dealt with at the federal level			0
" @entity4 may have good intentions , they may be trying to make up for where the @entity20 government has failed , but what the judge is saying is , this is not the way to do it , " he said as other states pass similar laws , @entity65 said , the issue is " very much destined for the @entity81			1
" state sen. @entity82 , author of the law , said he foresaw a protracted legal fight from the beginning			1
" i wrote it to go to the @entity81 , " he said before the ruling came down			2
" i 'm begging for that fistfight at the @entity81			2
we will win in a 5 - 4 decision and finally settle this problem			0
" he added , " my message to the judge , is uphold the @entity95			0
this is a battle of epic proportions			0
this is the states versus the central government			0
