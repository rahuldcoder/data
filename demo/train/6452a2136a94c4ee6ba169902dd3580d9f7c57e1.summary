-- last spring , the @entity1 held a hearing on implementation of the @entity4 , otherwise known as @entity4			1
sen. @entity5 , a @entity7 @entity6 and the chairman of the committee , was not pleased with how things were going			1
the @entity12 administration originally had asked for more than half a billion dollars to spend on public relations and outreach for the law			1
@entity17 @entity16 had returned with an offer of nothing			2
that 's right : zero dollars			2
without necessary funds , the @entity21 worried it would not have the necessary money to pay for navigators to help people enroll in health care , for the technology needed to implement the exchanges and for the public relations campaign that was required to inform citizens about what the law actually did			1
@entity21 secretary @entity33 made the controversial move of asking insurance companies and nonprofit organizations to donate money and help			2
she asked for more money			2
then , when she tried to move some money from the pr budget to replace cuts to other areas , @entity5 became quite upset			1
he was concerned that if the administration did not do more to inform people about the law and get implementation going , there would be problems : " a lot of people have no idea about all of this , " he said			1
" people just do n't know a lot about it , and the @entity60 poll pointed that out			0
i understand you 've hired a contractor			0
i 'm just worried that that 's gon na be money down the drain because contractors like to make money			0
... i just tell ya , i just see a huge train wreck coming down			1
" as i 've said before , it 's important to note that the " train wreck " @entity5 was describing was a botched implementation because not enough was being done to make things go smoothly			1
it was n't a description of the law itself but of what might occur if the government did not devote enough resources to making it work			0
@entity33 ' response was not surprising to those who were paying attention			0
she said that she was " incredibly disappointed " that all her requests for resources were being denied by @entity16			1
today , implementation has arrived , and if it 's not a train wreck , then it 's certainly close			1
the administration is still under fire because people can not get the insurance they want through the exchanges			1
but while i will continue to point out the problems with implementation and fault the administration for mistakes they 've made , how does one ignore the apparent hypocrisy from many politicians who are now " outraged " about the very problems they 've helped to create			1
republicans refused to appropriate money needed to implement @entity4			1
when @entity33 tried to shift money from other areas to help do what needed to be done , she was attacked by @entity16			0
at every step , republicans fought measures to get money to put towards implementation			1
is it really a surprise then that implementation has n't gone smoothly ? federal legislators are n't the only ones to blame			2
let 's remember that original versions of the bill called for one big national exchange			2
this would have been much easier to implement			0
but conservatives declared that insurance should be left to the states and kept out of the hands of the federal government			0
so as a compromise ( yes , those did occur ) , exchanges were made state - based instead of national			0
as a precaution , the law stipulated that if states failed to do their duty and enact exchanges , the federal government would step in and pick up the slack			2
this was to prevent obstructionism from killing the law			0
surprisingly , it was many of the same conservative states that demanded local control that refused to implement state - based exchanges , leaving the federal government to do it for them			0
that made implementation much harder			2
there have been books , webinars and meetings explaining how to sabotage the implementation of @entity4			1
there have been campaigns trying to persuade young adults not to use the exchanges			0
it is , therefore , somewhat ironic that many of the same people who have been part of all of this obstructionism seem so " upset " by the fact that people ca n't easily use the exchanges			0
for goodness sake , the government was shut down just a few weeks ago because some of the same people who are now bemoaning poorly functioning websites were determined to see that not one dime went to @entity4			1
lest you think i 'm defending this month 's rollout , i encourage you to review my last article here			0
i still maintain that the administration has had a failure in management in overseeing and reporting on progress towards october 1			2
but i 'm also sympathetic that they 've had a hard job to do			0
i would like to see this go better			0
i 'd like to see millions more get insurance			0
i 'd like to see the law of the land function as well as it can , and if it does n't , i 'd like to see @entity184 continue to amend it to make it work better			0
i 'd like a better health care system			1
what i can not ignore , however , are the many people who actively worked to see implementation fail now get the vapors over its poor start			1
the truth is , they got what they wanted			0
a victory lap is somewhat warranted , not concern - trolling			0
if , on the other hand , their concern is real , then i 'm sure the administration would welcome their help in making things right			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity204 : sen. @entity5 warned of " train wreck " in @entity4 implementation
he was referring to lack of funds ; @entity210 had denied them every step of the way , he says
he says now @entity210 *hypocritically* *decries* rocky exchange *launch* it worked to *thwart*
@entity204 : if @entity210 concerned about health care , it should help administration get it right
