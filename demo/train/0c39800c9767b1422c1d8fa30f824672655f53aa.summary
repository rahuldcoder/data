but it was @entity3 who had the best of the early skirmishes and @entity1 saw an effort thud against a post			0
but he was on target just after the half hour mark as an @entity59 scuffed effort fell into his path and he beat @entity27 to open the scoring			0
@entity45 was clearly less than fully fit , but his burst caused chaos in the @entity65 defense and when @entity67 crossed from the right a slight deflection saw the ball fall perfectly into the path of @entity10 , who volleyed home			0
@entity72 star @entity1 pulled a fine save out of @entity73 international @entity27 before halftime but the other side of the break saw @entity10 nearly add to his tally			0
@entity45 went off to give way to @entity79 and both sides had promising attacking moments as players tired			0
in extra time , @entity3 again looked the more threatening and when @entity84 cut the ball into the path of @entity14 he looked certain to score but put his effort into the side netting			2
penalties loomed until @entity14 did superbly to keep control of the ball down the left and his cross found @entity1 the more alert to end @entity4 's dream .			2
