@entity0 -- two hours before the @entity2 passed a short term spending bill that defunded @entity5 - something @entity6 said they will reject next week - @entity7 met to plan their next attack on president @entity10 's signature health care law			1
@entity2 @entity11 launches shutdown battle @entity14 : will it be a government shutdown or budget compromise ? house speaker @entity17 and other top leaders outlined a lengthy @entity11 wish list of items they plan to attach to legislation raising the nation 's debt limit , including a delay of @entity5			1
" this increase will also contain a number of important pro-growth economic policies , health care and non-health care reforms in addition to a one year delay in @entity5 , " @entity2 majority leader @entity26 announced on the @entity2 floor			2
@entity35 : the never - ending charade of debt ceiling fights after a rough week that started out with messy @entity11 infighting about strategy to deal with the government funding bill , the goal is to look ahead to the debt ceiling fight and keep republicans on the same page			1
" we have a good strategy			0
i think we 're on stride and we 're going to keep this fight going throughout this entire episode			0
the fight to delay @entity5 does n't end next week			1
it keeps rolling on until we get it , " rep @entity52 told reporters after the meeting			0
cruz : @entity5 fight ' just beginning ' @entity59 favors @entity2 @entity11 budget push on @entity5 @entity61 on repealing @entity5 : ' not rational ' in order to avoid another internal fight , @entity11 leaders crafted a debt ceiling bill that essentially has something for everyone in the @entity11 conference			1
in addition to the delay of @entity5 , the measure will include provisions for major tax reforms , and changes to entitlement programs like @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity52 told reporters it will be modeled on a budget - it wo n't include specific changes to the tax code , but it will give instructions to both the @entity2 and @entity6 to pass tax reform by a specific deadline			0
@entity11 aides declined to say what specific changes to entitlement programs would be in the bill , but congressional @entity11 have pushed to change the way @entity77 benefits are adjusted for inflation , effectively lowering annual increases for @entity77 recipients			1
the measure would also include approval of the @entity99 pipeline , a measure the @entity10 administration has held up for five years due to possible environmental concerns			0
@entity10 wants limits on coal plants , says @entity99 ca n't boost pollution @entity11 members also want to approve more offshore energy production , arguing both these policies would boost job creation			2
@entity2 @entity11 also plan to attach several provisions to roll back regulations on coal plants and other industries			2
these are bills the @entity2 has passed before , but have failed to move in the @entity115 - led @entity6			0
@entity116 limits carbon pollution from new power plants president @entity10 and @entity6 @entity6 insist they will not negotiate on a measure to authorize additional borrowing authority for the @entity121 , which is projected to run out sometime in october or early november			0
@entity10 on debt ceiling : ' we are not some banana republic ' @entity35 : debt ceiling ' x date ' could hit oct. 18 @entity127 : @entity10 ' used to being @entity128 ' they argue @entity14 should not risk the nation 's credit limit with another down to the wire brawl over major policy issues like health care and taxes			1
@entity10 and @entity17 spoke on friday , an aide to the speaker said			0
" the president called the speaker this evening to tell him he would n't negotiate with him on the debt limit			2
given the long history of using debt limit increases to achieve bipartisan deficit reduction and economic reforms , the speaker was disappointed but told the president that the two chambers of @entity14 will chart the path ahead			2
it was a brief call , " the aide said			0
but @entity17 and other @entity7 say @entity10 himself agreed to add other measures to reduce the deficit in the last major negotiation over the debt limit			0
" we 're going to put a lot of things on the table			0
and one thing you 'll see is six times since 1985 have the president and @entity14 negotiated the debt ceiling			1
the last time was august 2011 , and that was @entity10			0
so , to say it ca n't happen or wo n't happen just simply is n't true			0
it 's happened a number of times , " @entity168 @entity167 rep. @entity167 said			0
@entity173 @entity11 rep @entity172 called the fight on the stopgap spending bill and @entity5 " one step of many " but was reluctant to endorse the @entity11 package unveiled on the debt ceiling , telling reporters " i think we 're moving in the right direction			1
" this strategy to allow @entity2 @entity11 to pile on to the debt ceiling bill a host of major policy items is designed to keep the party unified - temporarily at least			1
but delaying @entity5 for a year and rolling back @entity10 administration regulations are non-starters with @entity6 , and not the debate they want to have on a must - pass bill that the credit markets are monitoring			2
on the heels of the spending fight @entity2 @entity11 leaders want to try to force the @entity2 and @entity6 @entity6 to come to the table on the debt ceiling			1
but adding a mix of controversial items to the bill only increases the threat of a default , and ensures @entity204 will be tied up for the next several weeks , if not months , with partisan fighting that could ripple through the financial markets .			1

next fight with president will be over debt ceiling
@entity11 seek to maintain united front in *opposition* to @entity5 and other issues
debt ceiling bill will include laundry list of @entity11 *priorities* on entitlements , taxes , energy , jobs
adding a mix of controversial items increases the threat of a default on @entity229 debt
