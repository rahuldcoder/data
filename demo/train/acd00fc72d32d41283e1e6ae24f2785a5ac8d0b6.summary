-- at the @entity2 , we consider ourselves to be impatient optimists -- we are impatient with the way the world is , but optimistic that changing it is possible			1
one reason for this optimism is the progress that we have seen in the 10 years since the @entity9 created the @entity10 , eight international goals to improve social and economic conditions in the world 's poorest countries			1
recently , we partnered with @entity15 to create a global event to discuss this progress			2
@entity18 was hosted in @entity19 and broadcast live to over 80 simultaneous @entity21 events in 40 countries around the world , including sites in @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity28 ; @entity29 , @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 ; and @entity33 , @entity34			2
the millennium goals themselves embody impatient optimism			2
they recognize how much there is to be done , while at the same time signaling the scale and scope of the world 's ambition			1
the world is not called on to conjure progress from a void			1
instead , it is called on to learn from very real progress on nearly all the goals , to expand it , and to speed it up			2
one refrain i hear is that we are off track on many of the goals			0
that statement is technically accurate			0
not every country will meet every goal , and there is a risk that some of the global goals wo n't be met			0
but that binary outlook -- with total success on one side , total failure on the other , and people on all sides blaming each other -- obscures extraordinary progress driven by extraordinary people across the globe			1
take the goal for child mortality			1
the goal is a two - thirds reduction , and we may not reach it by 2015			2
but have we failed when 4 million children who would have died in 1990 will survive in 2010 ? have we failed when we have reduced polio , a crippling childhood disease , by 99 percent in the past 20 years ? another complaint i hear a lot is that progress is n't spread evenly			1
some people dismiss the fact that 1.3 billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty by pointing out that most of them live in @entity90 and @entity30 , not in @entity92 countries			0
i believe that when poor people lift themselves out of poverty , we ought to celebrate , no matter where they happen to live			0
@entity96 and i started our foundation because we believe that all lives have equal value , and i am not comfortable comparing one person 's suffering to that of another			1
while it 's true that some countries are reducing poverty more quickly than others -- and some , sadly , have moved backwards -- eight @entity92 countries have already achieved the goal on poverty reduction , and several more are on schedule to do so by 2015			1
across nearly every goal , there are inspiring examples of even the poorest countries making dramatic improvements in short periods of time			0
however , we can also learn from the successes in other sectors			0
my @entity18 talk focuses on the question of how @entity123 has become so ubiquitous around the world and what governments and the development community can learn from the company 's success			1
by analyzing what @entity123 has done to become so prevalent , we can apply those lessons to the millennium goals and save even more lives			1
the task ahead is to learn what 's working so that we can spread best practices			2
in difficult economic times , it is imperative that we increase support for effective interventions that provide maximum value for money -- and not shift even bigger burdens to the poorest by cutting back on development spending			0
i am impatient because the world is not getting better fast enough , or for enough people			1
but i am also optimistic			0
i am optimistic because there are proven and affordable ways to decrease hunger and poverty , to help mothers and their babies thrive , to make rapid progress on all the @entity10			1
and i am optimistic that our impatience will lead us all to be more motivated , not less			0
i am optimistic that our sense of urgency will inspire us to work together , not to isolate ourselves			0
for if we are motivated , if we are inspired , if we work together -- then we can meet again in five years to celebrate achievements that few of us might have dared to imagine			0
i 'm grateful to @entity0 for including my @entity18 presentation as part of their tedtalks tuesday series			0
there were several other speakers who joined our event that day , and i urge you to come to our @entity18 website and watch their speeches as well			0
@entity169 , professor of international health at the @entity171 in @entity172 , who uses statistics to show concrete examples of progress in child health ; @entity178 , a renowned international advocate for women 's and children 's rights , on the key role of women and girls in achieving social change ; @entity185 , aka mr. condom , the founder and chairman of the @entity188 , on creative approaches to family planning			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity193 : the @entity9 adopted @entity10 10 years *ago*
she says there 's been extraordinary progress in many areas
reduction in child mortality alone will save 4 million lives in 2010 , compared to 1990 , she says
gates : i 'm optimistic about the world but impatient for faster change
