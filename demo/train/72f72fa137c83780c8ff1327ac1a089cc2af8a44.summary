-- the sea is a demanding environment , so people always ask , " how are you able to sail if you ca n't see ? " the answer : i have an acute " spacial " awareness and directional ability , and i use the wind 's varying pressure and patterns of waves to determine the direction i 'm headed			1
the truth of the matter is at night on the sea , everyone is blind			1
when the darkness takes over , it can be the most frightening or peaceful of times			0
a time when you can be at one with the ocean and your vessel , whether a totally blind sailor like me or blessed with 20/20 vision			2
when i became completely blind in 1984 , i first thought sailing would no longer be possible			2
then i was introduced to a program called " @entity30 , " which is designed to teach people with disabilities of all kinds how to sail			1
i realized it was something i had to be a part of , and i welcomed one of my truest passions back into my life			0
having logged thousands of coastal and offshore sailing miles in my youth , i 've been able to add to my experience by sailing and racing on the @entity46 with " challenged @entity47			0
" this includes being the captain on two trans - @entity52 races from @entity53 to @entity54			0
ultimately , my blindness is n't my biggest challenge when i take to the open sea -- it 's my type 1 diabetes			1
many people do n't realize the daily , if not hourly requirements that people with diabetes face			1
but it 's a disease that when properly managed can be nothing more than something you live with , rather than something that determines how you live			2
i did n't discover that i had diabetes until 1968 , when i awoke from a diabetic coma in a military hospital in @entity73			2
as an infantry sergeant , i went unconscious during battle , was presumed dead and placed in a body bag			0
fortunately , two days later , an alert medic who was putting toe tags on dead soldiers felt my pulse still beating and immediately rushed me to the hospital			0
i credit diabetes with saving my life , as i later learned that many soldiers in my outfit were killed or wounded			2
advances in diabetes have come a long way since then			0
it 's technology like my waterproof @entity91 insulin pump and new therapies and treatment that have made my journey to this point possible			0
even when you are at sea , controlling your diabetes is so much easier than just a few short years ago			1
today i 'm grateful for the life i 've been given			0
i hope that how i 've lived and what i 've accomplished serves as inspiration for the disabled and the millions of @entity47 touched by type 1 diabetes every day			1
through the " @entity30 " program , i vow to strive for more			1
i am proud to say that this program not only introduces adaptive sailing to people living with disabilities , but also goes far beyond and has led to opportunities for further education and employment for many individuals			1
i hope that in sharing my story i motivate others to find a way to make their dreams and passions a reality			0
my next goal : to sail around the world either solo or with a crew of sailors with disabilities .			1

@entity124 has been *legally* blind since the 1970s
@entity126 teaches people with disabilities to sail with the @entity30 program
@entity126 also has type 1 diabetes , and has to control his disease while at sea
