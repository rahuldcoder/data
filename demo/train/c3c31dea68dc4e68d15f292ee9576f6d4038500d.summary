@entity0 -- when dr. @entity3 decided to give up her career as a doctor in @entity0 in favor of full - time kayaking , she could never have imagined that a kayaking expedition in @entity9 would ultimately lead her back to it			1
a native of @entity12 , @entity0 , @entity13 worked hard to achieve her goal of becoming a doctor , attending @entity16			2
but at the time of the expedition , in 2003 , @entity13 had decided a full - time medical career just was n't for her			2
" i really did not see myself going back to medicine , " she said			1
" then the trip to @entity24 happened , and everything changed			1
" according to the @entity26 , the @entity27 refugee agency , @entity24 has one of the highest malaria death rates in @entity9			1
despite being warned the country was facing a dire outbreak , @entity13 embarked on a cross-country kayaking trip to the @entity33 along with @entity34 , a boat designer for one of her kayaking sponsors , @entity37			2
they took antimalarial drugs and slept under mosquito nets			2
they figured they 'd be fine			0
it was n't long before @entity34 came down with malaria , and @entity13 's background as a doctor was called upon			1
" luckily for all of us , @entity34 ended up being fine , " she recalls , " but it was a wake - up call			0
" it was a wake - up call that piqued @entity13 's interest as a doctor			0
if @entity34 could catch malaria despite precautions , how about those who lived in these malarial regions year - round ? @entity13 went to the nearest village and conducted a 50 - hut survey			2
the results astounded her : " nobody had a mosquito net , not one single person we interviewed			0
everyone reported at least one child in their household dying from malaria , and everyone wanted more information			2
" residents of a small village named @entity75 asked @entity13 , or " dr. @entity3 " as she 's known locally , to stay and build a clinic			1
" i knew absolutely nothing about it , " she admitted			0
but the will was there : on her return to @entity0 , @entity13 raised $ 25,000 -- enough to build a clinic and found @entity84			1
@entity13 says that aside from the funds , the support and encouragement of the villagers was vital to bringing the project to fruition			0
" to do this work , you need the community 's support and blessing , " she said			0
" the entire process is a shared endeavor			0
" @entity98 is 10 kilometers ( 6.2 miles ) downstream from @entity99 , @entity24 , which sits at the source of the @entity33			1
the clinic now receives 50 to 100 patients a day -- up from eight to 10 when it first opened			0
patients run the gamut from tiny babies with malaria to those with advanced cancers and other disorders			2
as well as treating patients , outreach and educational programs form a large part of @entity84 's doctrine			1
@entity13 says its malaria outreach programs have taught more than 100,000 people about prevention and provided more than 45,000 mosquito nets to the community at a fraction of the cost			1
with one of the highest birth rates in @entity9 , @entity13 discovered , many @entity24 had little to no education about conception or contraception			1
her family planning outreach works in 39 villages every three months and has overtaken even the malaria outreach in popularity			1
@entity13 describes vast differences in the communities she serves since the clinic began			0
she says knowledge of malaria prevention is much more widespread , and she 's seen a huge increase in the numbers of people sleeping under mosquito nets			2
@entity13 says @entity84 's reputation has grown to the point where patients now come from all over @entity24			1
( it has implemented a referral system to assist with some more complicated diseases )			0
these days , kayaking has taken a back seat to doctoring for 44 - year - old @entity13 , who has relegated it from full - time job to part - time stress reliever , but she still takes part in freestyle kayaking and will be competing in the @entity159 circuit in @entity160 this summer			0
@entity13 now lives in @entity24 five or six months of the year , despite the fact that a recently completed dam has turned the nearby section of whitewater she used to kayak into a lake			1
she says the locals fear that fewer kayaking opportunities mean she 'll leave , but she reassures them that as long is the need is there , so is she			0
" i feel very lucky to be able to do this work , " she said			0
" you just never know what life has in store for you ! "			0

dr. @entity3 gave up medicine to be a kayaker , but medicine found her again
she is helping *tackle* malaria in @entity24
@entity84 also offers outreach and educational programs
family planning outreach has become even more popular than antimalaria efforts
