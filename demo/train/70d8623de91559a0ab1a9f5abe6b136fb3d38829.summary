a small but growing group of @entity1 is increasingly worried about the fallout from the government shutdown and say it 's time for speaker @entity5 to allow a simple vote on a spending bill			1
defunding @entity9 can wait for now , they say			0
" i 'm trying to be optimistic but at the same time i have a really , really tough time when people are out of work and they ca n't pay their bills , " rep. @entity10 of @entity11 told reporters wednesday			2
" though it might be a political loss for us ... this is an untenable situation			0
" rep. @entity22 , whose @entity24 district is home to a significant number of military members and civilian contractors , was one of the first to publicly break away			0
" we fought the good fight , " he said in a tweet on tuesday , but acknowledged it was time to move on			0
@entity5 hosted small groups of concerned members on wednesday			2
a spokesman for @entity5 declined to talk about the sessions			0
a @entity38 source familiar with one of wednesday 's meetings said @entity5 listened , but did n't signal he was willing to allow a vote on a clean bill			1
" they were n't strong - armed , and they were n't asked to step back , " the source said of the moderates in the meeting			1
it was taken as a positive sign that @entity5 was n't trying to muzzle the effort			2
another @entity1 @entity38 source acknowledged that the group does n't yet have the numbers , muscle or will to force @entity5 's hand			1
to do so , they would need to stick together and vote with @entity57 to block any piecemeal spending bills from coming up			1
the only @entity38 to do that so far is rep. @entity60			1
one of the @entity38 who met with @entity5 wednesday told @entity61 they are giving him a bit more time to let things play out , but could decide to rebel by the end of the week			1
the shutdown : @entity67 on the edge @entity1 meeting there were no apparent breakthroughs during a midweek meeting at the @entity1 between congressional leaders and president @entity74			2
descriptions of the meeting ran the gamut			0
@entity74 called the session " useful ; " @entity1 minority leader @entity79 said it was " worthwhile " and @entity5 cast it as a " polite conversation			0
" senate minority leader @entity83 , however , called it " unproductive			0
" but the major players were all in the same room at the same time , talking to each other -- something that has n't happened much in recent weeks			2
following @entity90 's playbook as the shutdown lingers , some @entity38 moderates are openly frustrated that tea party darling sen. @entity90 of @entity95 appears to be calling the shots on what @entity1 @entity38 do next			1
@entity90 was one of the first to suggest passing narrow bills that fund those government agencies or functions that generate any public backlash			2
" i think the leadership is committed to play the @entity90 strategy all the way out , " @entity106 rep. @entity105 told reporters , before adding " if you can call it a strategy			0
" for two days , @entity38 leaders have pushed through a series of piecemeal spending bills for floor votes that would fund things like veterans affairs , national parks and medical research			1
@entity1 majority leader @entity119 said wednesday they plan to continue doing this			0
" we 've got ways to ease the pain on people , " @entity119 said			0
" we agree on a lot around here			0
we ought to fund that , and then we ought to sit down and talk about that which we do n't			2
" still , the spending measures have no hope of passing , because the @entity57 - led @entity132 wo n't approve the bills and , even if they did , the @entity1 has promised a veto			1
shutdown : @entity137 - @entity136 football game on ; others in limbo moderates meet @entity60 hosted a group of mostly moderate @entity38 members in his office early wednesday that want @entity5 to allow a vote on a clean spending bill			1
he told reporters about 10 members attended , but said he believes there are about two dozen who would publicly back a clean spending plan -- one that does n't try to strip the funding from president @entity74 's signature healthcare program			2
" i could be wrong , but i think if you had a secret ballot , 180 would vote for a clean @entity156 , " @entity60 said			0
but it 's more likely that a shift in @entity1 @entity38 strategy wo n't come in public defiance on the @entity1 floor , @entity60 said , but in quiet talks behind closed doors			1
" maybe it 's because i come from @entity11			0
i rely on back room meetings to get things done , " he said			0
" i 'm hoping someone 's going to meet behind the scenes somewhere and we 're going to make a deal			0
" one senior @entity38 familiar with the talks argued that the effort may be small now , but it is expanding , and will grow as more republicans hear from constituents back home that are hurting from the shutdown			1
" it 's day 2 of the shutdown -- we went from six or seven ( members ) to over 20 today , " the senior @entity38 told @entity61			1
another @entity38 member familiar with the discussions told @entity61 they would only get serious if they stood together as a group to block a vote			1
" the only way we 're going to get @entity5 and @entity119 to change course is if we can bring things to a halt , " said the source , who asked to speak anonymously while talks continue			0
a perilous strategy but it could be risky for these @entity1 @entity38 to take a stand against the @entity195 faction of the @entity38			1
at the weekly lunch of the @entity199 , a group of fiscal conservatives , the rumblings of the moderate @entity38 members came up			1
some in the room said they should " go after " those fellow @entity38 and put pressure on them to fall in line , according to a @entity38 source familiar with the discussions			2
but another @entity38 congressional source in the meeting said the message was softer			2
members of the committee were encouraged to have " one - one - one converstations " with moderates to convince them to stick with the current @entity38 leadership strategy			1
@entity105 told reporters he expected the shutdown to go through the weekend and possibly through mid-october when @entity217 needs to raise the debt ceiling			2
he does n't think the current @entity1 @entity38 plan , which he repeatedly said is being dictated by @entity90 , is helping the @entity38 cause of defunding or delaying @entity9			1
but he said he will vote for the smaller spending bills out of loyalty to @entity5 , even as he criticized the group behind @entity90 as " lemmings			0
" " i 'm going to continue to support our leadership			0
even if we have entered the valley of death , when you enter the valley of death you have to keep running and the whole team has to stick together , " a frustrated @entity105 told reporters outside the @entity1 floor			0
@entity60 acknowledged the effort to get more republicans to push for a clean spending bill could take some time and probably would n't result in a new strategy until " the tea party has had enough			1
" @entity67 shutdown threatens launch of @entity244 's next mission to @entity245			0
