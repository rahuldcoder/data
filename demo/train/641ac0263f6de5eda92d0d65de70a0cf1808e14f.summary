-- a study by the @entity4 concluded last month that many of the buildings in @entity7 were so shoddily constructed that they were unlikely to survive any disaster , let alone an earthquake like the one that devastated @entity12 on tuesday , the man who supervised the report said wednesday			1
" you could tell very easily that these buildings were not going to survive even a [ magnitude ] 2 earthquake , " said @entity13 , director of the @entity14 at @entity4 in @entity15			1
structures were built on slopes without proper foundations or containment structures , using improper building practices , insufficient steel and insufficient attention to development control , the urban planner said			0
much of the poor - quality work can be traced to the grinding poverty pervasive in @entity7 , he said			1
" as we know , the poverty in @entity7 lends itself to people building where they want , how they can , " he said			1
" it was our experience , especially coming out of @entity35 , that in the poorer countries the construction quality standards are pretty lax , " " unfortunately , the earthquake yesterday has revealed that			0
" after @entity40 flattened much of @entity35 in september 2004 , the @entity4 carried out a similar research effort , then helped the island nation strengthen its building practices , @entity13 said			2
within three years , artisans and engineers had been trained to strengthen that island 's building - control systems and procedures , he said			2
" we worked with the banks to be sure we could properly vet applications for mortgages			0
" but much of the @entity55 , including @entity7 , has no building codes , he said			2
" so now we need to work with the @entity7 authorities to develop a building code that is suited to @entity7 and its peculiar conditions			1
" those peculiarities include its location on a fault line and in the path of hurricanes			0
@entity13 said the country must work with the private sector and the banking sector to devise a low - income building ethic for @entity7			1
" because of the poverty levels , not everybody 's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require , " @entity13 said			1
tuesday 's earthquake showed that even those buildings that should have been constructed to the highest standards -- hospitals , schools , the presidential palace -- collapsed , he said			0
" schools , hospitals , all government facilities should be safe so that , in the event of catastrophes like these , these buildings can withstand these things so there can be some continuity in the operations of government and the private sector , " he said			0
" going forward , we need to help @entity7 to build back better			2
" that means building safer homes that can withstand hurricane - force winds and earthquakes of 7 magnitude , he said			0
but any such effort will require a great deal of support from the international community and collaboration with universities so that they can train the next generation of engineers , construction workers and masons to help @entity12 rebuild safely			0
the report -- funded by the @entity4 and more than 100 pages in length -- has not been made public , he said			1
" it was not produced for external consumption , " he said , adding that he did not know when parts of it might be released .			0
