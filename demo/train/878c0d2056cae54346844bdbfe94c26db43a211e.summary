for his procession to become president i was in @entity8 and his speeches were spine tingling			1
@entity11 can talk , and coming after @entity13 it was something to behold			0
in my humble opinion , if he loses the next election to the other bunch then , good lord , i will run myself			0
" so says @entity19 , former creative force of @entity21 band @entity20 and one of rock ' n ' roll 's biggest mouths			1
singer - songwriter , brother to @entity27 and now a @entity8 presidential candidate : 2012 promises to be quite a year for the 45 - year - old whose song - writing talent has taken him from unemployment in a city called @entity34 in northern @entity35 to sell - out stadium tours around the world , playing to millions			1
by september , @entity19 will have completed the tour of his first solo album since the demise of @entity20 in 2009 ; an expedition entailing 81 shows across @entity46 , the @entity41 ( @entity42 and @entity43 ) and @entity8 as well as being a voyage into the unknown for the forthright backing - singer - now - frontman			1
it was initially intended as a small affair , but such has been the demand for the new record -- " @entity55 " topped the charts in the @entity21 in october 2011 -- theaters have rapidly been upgraded to arenas to cope with demand			1
a move that surprised the man himself and maybe explains the overriding mood of calm satisfaction the guitarist exudes from beneath a leather jacket as he sits down with a coffee to talk to @entity0			0
" the amount of tickets i 've sold , the amount of records i 've sold ... @entity69 ( just ) did n't have any expectations for the new record			2
i thought i might stall at playing theaters for a couple of years but i 've gone up to arenas before the end of the first year , so i 'm blown away by that			0
" part of me thinks : ' of course i 'll be playing arenas because i 'm f * * * * * * brilliant and the songs are f * * * * * * brilliant so it 's inevitable , but the other part of me says i do n't have any divine right to do that and i 've got to work at it			2
turns out , the former was correct ! i am very grateful though			0
" it is not the first time the man dubbed " @entity19 " by former band mates , has experienced a wave of success			1
until 2009 , @entity19 had been the artistic catalyst and the calmer half of the capricious brotherly partnership that saw @entity20 , with their mix of @entity97 melodies and @entity98 attitude , conquer charts around the world and become one of the planet 's biggest - selling bands			1
@entity20 ' second album ( what 's the story ) morning glory ? broke into the @entity110 top ten and sold nearly four million copies in the @entity8 alone			1
but this figure proved to be seven times the sales of the group 's next three albums put together according to @entity116 , a position that left many critics to argue that , unlike other @entity21 musical exports that had gone before them , the @entity19 's had not been taken to heart by the @entity8 music - buying public			1
it 's an assertion the writer of @entity126 contests			2
" we got off on the wrong foot with @entity8 because they are extremely professional corporate people and we kind of treated that attitude with contempt			2
the only time we were ever on the cover of @entity133 they set aside eight hours for a photo shoot			0
eight hours ! i think we stayed for an hour ... and they could n't believe it			0
( but ) we just could n't understand why you have to enter into theatrics with @entity133 magazine on a day off , because we were s * * * - kickers from the streets and did n't have time for that			0
" four @entity8 tours in a row were either never started or never finished ( with @entity20 ) and we were subtitled on television because of our accents ... basically people could n't understand a word we were saying			1
we also did n't have a front man like @entity152 or @entity153 , we had a different kind of front - man who was like @entity156 , but i do n't think anybody ... would look back at it with regret , we did what we did on our own terms			0
" a staunch defense maybe of a band @entity19 currently has no plans to reform , but for someone so imbued with a @entity21 identity , the new album has particularly strong @entity8 sentiments			1
the new band includes an @entity8 guitarist , the first single release -- ' @entity172 ' -- has a @entity174 - style brass section , and the videos for all the singles so far -- including ' @entity177 ' and ' @entity178 ... what a life ! ' -- have a 1970 's @entity181 theme with @entity19 as a central figure			1
despite this , when asked if this had been a conscious thematic move , @entity19 remains adamant there is no new ambition to " crack " the @entity8			1
" ( @entity20 ) never had a number one album , we had a number two album ... we nearly got there			1
i do n't even know what cracking @entity8 is supposed to be though ? if it 's playing arenas everywhere , 10 thousand people a night then we did it			2
not that i 've got to justify it but we did sell out the @entity197 and @entity198 regularly and i 've got gold and platinum discs ( and ) the house to prove it , @entity202 ( sic )			0
we never won any @entity203 , we never got nominated , but those people like @entity205 and @entity206 ; f * * * me , enough said			0
" the solo album has received good reviews broadly speaking so far			1
@entity133 magazine gave it 3.5 out of five with the recommendation that @entity19 had : " @entity212 ( ed ) down the @entity97 ' lsd pop into @entity215 head - rushes like @entity20 did , he does his old band proud			1
" shout it out for me ! " he declares in ' @entity177 , ' making you want to do just that			0
" so did the album feel like a renaissance as it was being created ? " i 've made enough of my records to know this was a pretty good bunch of songs			2
when i heard the final mixes , i wanted to stand behind them , they were good			0
whether it gets five stars out of five or seven out of ten does n't make it any better or worse an album for me - or if it sells 700 thousand compared to 100 thousand - it is a good album because it is			2
" every album i 've ever been involved in , on the day that it came out i believed in it			2
believed in them all equally but it 's evident that @entity239 and definitely maybe have lasted for 18 years and some of them have n't			2
we wo n't know where this sits in the canon of what i 've done for another five years but i 'm confident it will be up there though , in fact i know it will			0
" the music on the new album breaks new ground for @entity19 , both in musical terms -- the @entity254 on ' @entity172 ' and the driving , repetitive beats of ' @entity257 ' and ' aka ... what a life ! ' -- and in the song 's lyrical content			1
they verge , even revel , in romance			0
" i do n't know how that happened ! my wife would say i 'm not romantic at all but i would say that i 'm the ultimate romancer because i write about ... life being brilliant			0
not like the @entity270 ( independent ) music scene where i come from , they like to sing about the news do n't they ? there 's nothing good on the news			0
you 're not telling me @entity0 is all cats in trees are you ? nothing can be that good if @entity278 is in it , you know what i mean ? " so the themes ( of the album are ) escapism , love , romance ; to be on a journey - though i do n't like that word , people say that on reality shows do n't they - you know when a fat person becomes skinny they 've been on a amazing journey			2
no they have n't , they 've been on an amazing treadmill			0
basically , the album includes brilliant and very well crafted songs , deceptively fantastic lyrics , all brilliantly played with the minimum of fuss and which are criminally underrated particularly in @entity8 , " @entity19 surmises in unabashed appraisal			1
but though his unshakable faith in his music remains the same as his halcyon days with @entity20 , touring is now a different proposition			2
as a father of three life on the road now also means life apart from his young family too			0
" the boys ( @entity316 and @entity202 ) do n't like me going away but i ca n't wait until they 're old enough so i can explain to them : ' you see all this all this multi-colored stuff ( in our house ) , where do you think it comes from ? well , it does n't come form @entity326 , somebody 's got to work for it and that somebody is me			0
so you jog on and go to bed and i 'll see you in a month			0
' " and with that @entity19 leaves the room to prepare for his latest arena show , played on this occasion in the @entity334 city of @entity335 , a stone 's throw from the tiny venue where @entity20 were first discovered all those years ago			1
maybe now it is time for establishment acceptance of @entity19 in @entity8 , even if it is not in the @entity342 .			1

@entity19 , 45 , is former musical force behind @entity21 band @entity20
his new album : " @entity55 , " topped the charts in the @entity21 in october 2011
@entity20 ' second album ( what 's the story ) @entity239 ? sold nearly four million copies in the @entity8
first solo album tour includes 81 shows across @entity46 , the @entity41 ( @entity42 and @entity43 ) and @entity8
