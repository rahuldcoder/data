two @entity3 gunmen tried to kidnap two @entity5 embassy employees in @entity1 last month but were shot and killed by one of the @entity5 , a @entity1 government official told @entity7 on saturday			1
the attempted kidnapping was carried out by two armed men with @entity11 ( @entity11 ) on april 24 , and the fatal shooting occurred near a @entity1 barbershop " where many foreigners and diplomats go to get their hair cut , " the @entity1 official said			2
the two @entity5 @entity19 personnel , however , were apparently wayward and should n't have been at the barbershop , the official said			1
" these individuals violated security protocol , " the @entity1 official said			0
" @entity19 personnel are not allowed to leave their secure facilities			2
the @entity5 who shot the kidnappers had a gun permit and was authorized to carry a gun			0
the two armed kidnappers were @entity11 militants			0
they were n't unarmed civilians			0
" @entity30 , deputy spokeswoman for the @entity31 , said in a statement : " we can confirm that , last month , two @entity5 @entity19 officers in @entity1 fired their weapons after being confronted by armed individuals in an attempted kidnapping at a small commercial business in @entity39			1
two of the armed individuals were killed			0
the @entity19 officers are no longer in @entity1			1
" two @entity1 national security officials told @entity7 the plot against the @entity19 is bigger than initially believed			1
the revelation of the incident comes after the @entity19 in @entity1 was indefinitely shuttered wednesday amid security concerns and as fighting between security forces and @entity11 intensifies , including in the capital , @entity49			1
just days before the alleged abduction attempt , a joint @entity5 - @entity1 operation was being carried out against @entity11 in the @entity53 and @entity54 regions of @entity1 , but authorities did not disclose whether drones were used in the strikes			2
the use of the unmanned drones has stirred controversy due to the accidental killings of civilians in some cases , a high - level @entity1 official said at the time			0
on saturday , a top @entity1 @entity66 official said the @entity5 government had been considering closing the embassy two weeks ago , as attacks on foreigners intensified			1
the violence at the barbershop -- as well as violence against other foreigners in the past six weeks -- eventually convinced the @entity5 to close down the @entity5 embassy this past week , the official said			2
meanwhile , the @entity77 announced that seven more @entity11 fighters were killed saturday in the southern province of @entity54 during clashes with security forces			0
of all @entity3 - affiliated networks worldwide , @entity11 is considered the most dangerous threat to @entity5			2
meanwhile , the @entity1 government thursday expelled @entity5 freelance journalist @entity90 on accusations that " there was an issue with his documentation , " the @entity84 said			1
on @entity92 , @entity90 said the only official explanation for his deportation was he 's " no longer welcome in @entity1			0
" he 's written for the @entity96 and @entity97 and has lived in the @entity1 capital since january 2011 , his website says			0
a second @entity5 freelancer , @entity99 , was denied entry thursday into @entity1 after flying to @entity49 from @entity101 because , an unidentified @entity1 official told @entity84 , he lacked a journalist visa			1
a @entity1 national security source said saturday that two @entity5 journalists were recently barred because they are a high target for kidnapping with their continuous movements			2
the source also cited the growing @entity11 attacks in @entity49			0
at least seven journalists were abducted last year in @entity1 , @entity110 said			0
@entity3 - linked militants killed by @entity1 security forces			1
