@entity0 -- two men pleaded not guilty wednesday to felony charges related to the brutal beating of @entity6 fan @entity5 after a @entity8 game in march			1
late wednesday , prosecutors announced they wo n't charge a woman who 's the sister to one defendant and the girlfriend to the other because they do n't have enough evidence against her , a spokeswoman said			1
during their arraignment in @entity20 , @entity21 , 30 , and @entity22 , 29 , both of @entity17 , @entity18 , were ordered by the judge to remain in custody in lieu of $ 500,000 bail each			1
meanwhile , @entity27 , 31 , who is @entity22 's sister and the live - in girlfriend of @entity29 , wo n't be charged , said spokeswoman @entity30 of the @entity32 's office			1
" there 's not sufficient evidence , " @entity30 told @entity1			2
she was taken into custody last month with her brother and boyfriend			0
police allege that the two men kicked and punched @entity5 and then fled in a car driven by a woman			1
the two men withdrew their earlier request for a bond reduction wednesday , said @entity43 , @entity22 's attorney			1
@entity43 said the withdrawal " was best " for his client in the high - profile case , but the defendants can renew the request later			0
authorities have also kept the two defendants from taking showers , having visitors and making phone calls -- which was done " for their own protection " while in jail , @entity43 said			0
but the attorneys for the two defendants told the court wednesday they would file requests to have those activities restored			0
the two men are each charged with mayhem , assault and battery , and all three charges are felonies , according to the complaint provided by the @entity32 's office			1
@entity5 , a 42 - year - old paramedic from @entity68 , @entity18 , went into a coma as a result of the march 31 beating in the parking lot of @entity72 after a game between the @entity6 and the @entity8			1
@entity5 remained in serious condition wednesday at @entity76 and @entity77 , spokeswoman @entity74 said			1
@entity22 is also charged with two misdemeanor counts -- one for battery and the other for assault -- against one person inside the ballpark and another person in the stadium parking lot on the same day , according to court documents provided by prosecutors			2
@entity20 judge @entity88 denied a media request wednesday to have cameras in the courtroom because , he said , the identification issues surrounding the two men as defendants " are unresolved			0
" but the judge allowed journalists to make an audio recording of wednesday 's court proceeding			2
during arguments about the media 's camera request , @entity32 deputy district attorney @entity99 told the court that authorities have statements from the defendants that prosecutors used to file charges			0
one is a direct statement from @entity29 , and the other is a surreptitiously obtained statement by @entity22 , @entity99 said			2
@entity99 also said that only one of about 20 witnesses identified @entity22 as allegedly being involved in the beating , but no witnesses have identified @entity21 at the crime scene			1
asked about the alleged statements made by the defendants , @entity43 said : " you know , assertions are made in a case			0
making assertions and proving them are two different things			0
" @entity43 also said that wednesday was the first time he heard that authorities have only one witness identifying @entity22 at the alleged crime scene			1
" that 's a good piece of information to have , " @entity43 told reporters			0
" at this point , like i said , i 'm waiting for further discovery			0
" @entity43 said prosecutors still have to turn over 25 binders of information about the case , including video and audiotapes and photographs			0
so far , he has seen only about 20 pages and added that prosecutors just gave him wednesday a copy of the grand jury transcript that he understood included testimony by @entity22 's sister			1
" my understanding is that the family is close , and they have a good relationship , " @entity43 said of @entity22 and his sister			2
the two defendants ' next court hearing is september 30 , the judge said			0
@entity22 and @entity21 were arrested at their @entity155 homes on july 21			1
earlier this week , @entity5 's family reported on their website that @entity5 showed the most response yet since the beating on the @entity8 ' home opener : he lifted his left leg slightly when asked and raised his left arm every time family members asked if they could hold his hand			2
" and the best part ? " the family website said monday			0
" @entity168 ( @entity5 's sister ) asked @entity5 if she could have a kiss and every time she asked him , he puckered his lips			1
the final time when she was leaving , @entity168 asked again for a kiss			0
@entity5 turned his head towards her , puckered his lips for the kiss , then turned his head back			2
the nurse was shocked and excited to see that ! " the website then added : " side note from @entity181 : i have never , in my 32 years , thought i would kiss my brother on the lips , let alone that many times			0
but ca n't wait to do it again ! " side note from @entity188 ( another sister ) : i could n't be there to see it , but i never thought i would be jealous of my brother kissing my sister on the lips ... regardless , i am chapsticking up for my next visit			2
