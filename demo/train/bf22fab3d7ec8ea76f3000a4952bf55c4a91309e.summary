-- when a slow - motion massacre has unfolded over the course of 15 months , it 's easy to lose the world 's attention			1
but even the most jaded gasped in horror as news emerged of the latest carnage inflicted on the @entity11 people			1
the images from the town of @entity14 defied belief			1
forces loyal to @entity11 president @entity17 went on a systematic killing spree , murdering at least 108 people			1
most shockingly , the killers targeted women and children			2
a @entity24 representative said the victims included 49 children who were younger than 10			2
the @entity17 regime denied it carried out the atrocities , but @entity24 officials said they saw clear evidence that the @entity11 government was involved in the attacks			1
why would a regime , even a brutal dictatorship , send its thugs to kill women and children , even babies ? does it make any sense , even by the twisted logic of armed conflict and tyranny ? @entity11 says regime not to blame for massacre ; @entity46 says ' another blatant lie ' in a most perverse , sickening way , it makes perfect sense			1
and for the logic underlying this most inhuman tactic , one need only look at what has transpired in recent months and years as uprisings have sprung throughout the region , from @entity56 to @entity57			1
now that @entity58 has -- perhaps accidentally -- revealed that it has sent some of its forces to help @entity17 , the strategy has become even easier to understand			2
the @entity11 dictator is trying to restore a balance of fear , perhaps the most powerful weapon in the hands of tyrants throughout history			1
killing children is supposed to intimidate the opposition			1
a couple of days after the @entity14 massacre , a top commander of @entity56 's elite @entity74 , @entity75 , told a reporter from @entity56 's @entity78 news that " before our presence in @entity11 , too many people were killed by the opposition but with the physical and nonphysical presence of the @entity87 republic , big massacres in @entity11 were prevented			1
" @entity78 quickly deleted the interview , but the news was out			0
@entity75 is the deputy commander of the @entity90 , whose mission is " extraterritorial operations , " or revolution beyond @entity56 's borders			1
@entity96 diplomats are pushing for a negotiated settlement , but @entity11 , @entity56 's only ally in the @entity100 world , is following what looks very much like an @entity56 script , using blunt force to put down anti-government protests			1
that 's what @entity56 did in 2009 when the so - called @entity107 arose after the disputed presidential elections			1
@entity58 used its paramilitary @entity110 militias to brutally suppress the protests			0
but that was before the @entity100 uprisings showed people throughout the @entity114 that sometimes revolutions do succeed			0
when @entity17 scans the horizon , he sees what happened to other @entity100 dictators			0
the presidents of @entity121 , @entity57 and @entity122 have lost power			0
the example of @entity125 does not seem to apply to him so far , since opinion in the @entity127 until now has leaned against direct military intervention a reign of terror helped @entity17 's father , the feared @entity130 , keep power for three decades , and then hand the country to his son as if it amounted to private property to be inherited by the next generation			1
when the elder @entity17 faced an uprising in 1982 , he ordered his loyal army to pulverize the opposition			0
the entire town of @entity140 was razed to the ground			0
estimates of the dead range from 10,000 to 30,000 killed by @entity17 's troops			2
that put a quick end to the revolt			0
the younger @entity17 is trying to do his father proud			0
but , despite the mounting death toll , he has lost the weapon of fear			0
already 13,000 people are said to have died in the @entity11 uprising			1
despite that , the protesters are not staying home			0
@entity157 , incidentally , denies any responsibility for the @entity14 massacre			1
he blames " terrorists , " but nobody 's buying his denials			2
witnesses say , and the evidence confirms , that government troops started firing tank shells and mortars at protesters during the friday demonstration that has become a ritual of the anti-dictatorship movement			0
but the worst was yet to come			0
@entity14 is a @entity173 town , a stronghold of the @entity176 movement			2
it is also home to a military college , from where the tank and mortar fire came			0
@entity24 observers found evidence of tank shells , which are not part of the opposition 's arsenal			2
before long , paramilitary forces known as the @entity190 -- the @entity11 version of @entity56 's @entity110 -- joined the fight , assaulting demonstrators with gunfire and knives			1
by nightfall , the attacks became the worst of nightmares			0
the @entity190 , gangs of thugs and criminals , mostly belong to the president 's @entity204 sect			2
according to the @entity24 , about 20 people were killed by artillery fire			0
most of the others were murdered execution - style in their homes			0
in some cases , entire families were killed			0
in the face of the heart wrenching death toll , the @entity214 , the @entity127 and the rest of the world are feeling renewed pressure to take action			2
the @entity11 opposition and some in the region have called for intervention , but few are inclined to step in			2
some observers , including @entity227 , a former national security adviser , say the @entity214 should step back , arguing that as tragic as the situation is , there are many other problems of greater importance			0
but the probable presence of @entity56 in @entity11 highlights just how important this battle is , and not just for the @entity11 people			1
the @entity214 and the rest of the world should care about @entity11 not only for humanitarian reasons , but because the entire @entity114 is now in play			1
if @entity17 survives , it will mark a victory for anti-american , anti-democratic forces in the @entity114			2
it will tilt the balance of power in the region in favor of dictatorship , in favor of the use of force and fear as the instrument of power and in favor of a regime in @entity58 whose aim is to export its brand of retrograde , anti-american , anti-women , anti-gay , freedom - suppressing revolution			2
if @entity17 falls , it will mark a major defeat for @entity56 , one that will alter the region in ways that , while not certain to follow @entity214 wishes in every respect , has the potential to eventually improve stability			1
this is the @entity11 people 's fight , and there 's no need now to put @entity214 " boots on the ground			1
" but the @entity214 government has a long menu of options to help bring about the end of the despicable @entity17 regime			0
no choice is without risk , and no route is assured of success , but it is clear that those seeking to overthrow the @entity17 regime should receive more active help from the @entity127			0
the riskiest course of action is to stay on the sidelines and let @entity17 murder his people while we look the other way			0
the killing of children by a regime determined to intimidate the opposition made that point abundantly clear			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity298 .			0

@entity300 : the @entity14 massacre caused much of the world to gasp
she says the regime is killing *civilians* , even children , to maintain a balance of terror
@entity11 's regime is choosing to follow path @entity56 used in crushing @entity312 , she says
@entity314 : it 's not a *surprise* that @entity56 forces are in @entity11 , helping the regime
