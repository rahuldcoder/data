-- @entity2 @entity1 just went through the pageantry of the changing of the guard with their leadership elections			1
but new names on the door wo n't change their party 's priorities : protecting special interests , the ultra-wealthy and their own perks at the expense of middle - class @entity15			1
the term " @entity1 leadership " has become the biggest oxymoron in politics			2
if we learned one thing from @entity1 ' elections , it 's that their leadership simply follows their tea party base in an unceasing march to the right			1
following their losses at the ballot box in 2012 , @entity1 rolled out a post-mortem calling for a move to the middle , recognizing that their days as a competitive national party were numbered if they continued on their current rightward path			1
since then , we have seen republicans across the country do the exact opposite			2
they have grown more paranoid , more insular and more fearful			0
it 's that fear of the tea party that shut down the government to disastrous consequences last year , and it 's that fear that just caused them to replace one leader of the @entity1 shutdown with another			1
in 2011 , when @entity48 took over as speaker , he was billed as a moderate			0
and @entity50 was called mainstream			0
but both alternated between being hamstrung by and kowtowing to their right wing and drove their majority off a cliff			0
and the numbers speak for themselves : after three and a half years , they have turned @entity57 into the least - trusted institution in @entity15			0
@entity59 now pegs confidence in @entity57 at just 7 % â € ” the lowest confidence rating for any institution ever recorded by @entity59 in the past 40 years			0
with ratings that abysmal , one might think that @entity2 @entity1 might use a turnover in leadership as an opportunity to steer their sinking ship in a new direction			1
@entity70 and @entity71 are members of the same tea party club and were elected on pledges of fealty to the @entity74 agenda			1
and that agenda will keep turning off the @entity15 public , dragging their ratings down and dragging republicans further and further outside the mainstream			2
the tragedy is that the middle class pays the price			0
how did we get to this place , where the @entity2 majority continues to move so far from the center of @entity15 politics that they can no longer see it ? @entity93 provides some clues , finding in its polling that " the @entity74 is in a very different place on key issues " than even other , mainstream @entity1			1
take immigration as an example			0
just 19 % of tea party republicans believe immigration helps the @entity15 , compared to 47 % of the country at large			1
with @entity2 @entity1 beholden to this tiny minority of the country at large , they will continue to drag their party to the right â € ” and their so - called leadership will have no choice but to follow , if they want to keep their jobs			1
you can change the names on the door , but the out - of - touch agenda remains the same			0
if the country is to have any hope of combating the serious challenges facing us and creating an economy that works to lift up middle - class families , we need more than just a change of figureheads in the @entity2			2
we need to change the @entity2 majority			2
join us on @entity122 / @entity121 .			0
