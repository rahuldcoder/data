" @entity4 has not yet commented on the cleric 's remarks			1
@entity9 -- known as one of the spiritual leaders of the @entity7 movement -- met with @entity4 during the final day of the @entity5 president 's visit to @entity1			1
the religious leader and former @entity1 senator runs an @entity34 seminary in northwest @entity1 that produced many of the @entity5 @entity7 's leaders during the @entity5 jihad against the @entity39 occupation in the 1980s			1
@entity9 says he is in contact with senior leaders of the @entity7 but he did n't say who			2
he said the @entity7 have two key demands -- the exit of all foreign troops from @entity5 and the release of @entity5 @entity7 prisoners from detention centers in @entity49 and @entity50			2
" thousands of people have been killed in @entity5			0
why should the @entity7 start a dialogue without a guarantee that foreign forces will leave the region ? " @entity9 said			0
@entity9 said the @entity7 are reluctant to negotiate with @entity4 because they view him as a supporter of @entity58 policy in the region			2
" he needs to change that impression , " @entity9 said			0
@entity9 's comments come after the @entity7 rejected a reported claim thursday by @entity4 that the movement was taking part in secret talks with the @entity5 government			1
the statement followed a report in the @entity76 in which @entity4 said , " there have been contacts between the @entity58 government and the @entity7 , there have been contacts between the @entity5 government and the @entity7 , and there have been some contacts that we have made , all of us together			1
" @entity4 's assertion suggested a change in course for peace efforts , because the @entity7 has long publicly refused to meet with @entity4 's government , and @entity5 officials have complained they were largely sidelined in talks taking place between the @entity58 and the @entity7			1
" the last cards are with us			0
so far , it has been a @entity58 - @entity7 business			0
we have not been involved in this so i can not say what was discussed , " an @entity5 government official told @entity2 last month			0
last june , @entity4 said the @entity58 was involved in peace talks with the @entity7 , and that representatives of the government and insurgents had been in touch , but that no high - level meetings had taken place			2
