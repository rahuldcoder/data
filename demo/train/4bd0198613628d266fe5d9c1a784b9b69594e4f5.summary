-- with a litany of stubbed toes , sprained ankles , broken bones and blistered feet , @entity2 ' feet are hurting			2
according to the @entity7 released in june , 78 % of adults 21 and older have experienced one or more foot problems in their lives			1
one common culprit of @entity2 's foot pain , especially during the summer , is the flip - flop			1
whether it be on the beach , at the grocery store or even in the office , people love to free their feet			0
but flat sandals are nothing but bad news , says @entity23 , executive director for the @entity24 , who does n't own a single pair			0
" there 's no heel support and structural support ... on that little slab of rubber			2
" flip - flops have been around since at least 1500 b.c. they have been the choice of footwear for everyone from ancient @entity37 to @entity39 beach bums to @entity42 's women 's lacrosse team during a 2005 visit to the @entity44			1
providing wearers with ease and emancipation , flip - flops are hard not to love , said @entity49 , president and co-founder of @entity51			1
" it promotes this good mental state of health , " he said			0
" it 's hard to be in a bad mood when you 're wearing flip - flops			1
" despite the shoe 's popularity , @entity23 said there are many risks involved with wearing flip - flops			1
flip - flops are n't always easy on the feet although feet were designed to walk barefoot on @entity68 's natural surfaces ( grass , sand or gravel ) , they were not prepared to endure the concrete , asphalt and steel that covers so many landscapes today , @entity23 said			1
these unmovable surfaces are harsh on bare feet , and the thin rubber sole of many flip - flops does little to adequately absorb the shock they produce			1
whether you are standing still or in motion , your feet are your first point of contact with the ground			0
the way your feet are positioned provides the foundation for the body 's skeletal alignment			0
a flat shoe provides little arch or lateral support and even slight shifts in stance over time could lead to misalignment , causing pain in the knees , hips and back			2
" everything in your body starts with how you strike your heel to the ground , " @entity23 said			0
with nothing to keep a wearer 's foot in place , flip - flops can also lead to tumbles , twisted ankles and even broken bones			1
" you 're taking your five toes and grabbing your shoe to make sure it does n't slide out , " @entity23 said			0
" that action of the toes grabbing the shoe on the toe box is not normal			0
" shoes should flex where your foot bends , said @entity122 , a podiatrist at @entity123 at the @entity124 in @entity125			0
but the rubber soles of most flip - flops just bend all over the place , while the stiff soles of some stylish varieties may not bend at all , she said			1
flip - flops ' straps can also rub as a wearer walks , creating friction that leads to blisters			1
and because the lightweight sandals offer virtually no protection , it 's more common for wearers ' feet to get cuts , scrapes and bruises			2
" a little layer of rubber -- it will protect you from a stone or a glass , but a nail could puncture that , " @entity23 said			0
@entity122 said wearing flip - flops can be seriously detrimental for people whose feet are already at risk : for people with diabetes , who often have poor circulation and feeling in their feet , wearing flip - flops can expose them not only to injury but to infection			1
those with balance issues may find it hard to feel secure when wearing rubbery flip - flops			1
and for those suffering from obesity , sporting the unstructured shoe can add strain to feet that are already stressed with carrying extra weight			0
the real problem is that people are wearing flip - flops while doing everything from skateboarding to gardening to running errands , @entity122 said			2
" it 's not that they wear them , " @entity122 said			0
" but @entity49 said researchers , who typically refer in their studies to cheap rubber flip - flops that can be purchased at discount stores , must realize not all flip - flops are created equally			2
" they seem to miss that whole other part of the industry that is creating really good footwear with innovation and technology , " he said			0
@entity49 said oftentimes it 's such sandals that alleviate problems , not cause them			2
" i know a lot of people , both customers of our shop , friends and family , and people in the industry that wear flip - flops because they have problems , " he said			1
" it 's more comfortable , easier to put on and off , and there 's breathability			0
" rather than buying a $ 2 pair of rubber flip - flops at the drugstore , @entity49 suggests spending the extra money on a pair with deep heel cups , high arch support and comfortable toe support , such as those from @entity220 and @entity221			1
@entity122 agrees that there times when wearing flip - flops can be beneficial			2
in the health club locker room or at the community pool , flip - flops can protect feet against fungi and wart - causing viruses that can be acquired by walking around barefoot			1
the simple sandals can also shield feet against the beach 's hot sand , which might otherwise cause skin to burn and blister on your walk to the water			0
but flip - flop use should be limited , experts say			2
@entity122 's go - to shoe for everyday wear is a pair of tennis shoes			0
" the number one best shoe for everybody is a good athletic shoe â € ” something that laces up and has good structure to it , " @entity122 said			0
@entity23 said people should always wear padded , acrylic - blend socks , which wick moisture away from the foot , under properly fitted shoes that have plenty of toe room and support			0
@entity261 , which have some structure , cushion and breathability , can be an easy alternative to flip - flops , while sandals with a substantial foot bed and softer and broader straps are also a better option , @entity122 said			1
for people who insist on indulging in flip - flops ' cool convenience , @entity23 's asks them to avoid uneven surfaces and wash feet thoroughly after the sandals come off			1
" i tell people i 'm not going to change your lifestyle ; i just want you to know what the concerns are , " he said .			0
