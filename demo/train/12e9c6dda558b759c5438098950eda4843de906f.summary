as we mark @entity5 this year , it 's worth asking : can @entity6 handle either one ? when @entity8 became president of @entity10 after the end of apartheid he had two choices			1
he could have gone down a path of confrontation and retribution against the white @entity17 who had ruled so oppressively			1
or he could have skipped quickly past the history and reality of apartheid and pardoned all its perpetrators in the interests of maintaining order			1
in one of his many acts of civic genius , he chose a path for his country that exposed the ugliness of the past and only then invited forgiveness			1
his government launched a @entity33 , led by archbishop @entity34			1
the commission gathered public testimony across the land , naming the institutional structures and individual acts that had brutalized blacks			1
no perpetrator was granted amnesty without a candid accounting of his or her deeds			1
the opportunity for restorative justice gave every participant a sense of heightened responsibility -- a chance to be bigger citizens , together			2
only then could reconciliation begin			1
and though the commission was not sufficient to " solve race " in post-apartheid @entity10 , it was still necessary			2
without such an attempt at formal accounting , without such an opportunity for oppressed and oppressor to face one another , that nation 's challenges would be even greater today			1
for proof , consider our own nation 150 years post-slavery			2
for a fleeting while after the @entity67 , we tried @entity69			2
freedmen could earn wages and vote freely and claim an equal place in politics			2
then we gave up on @entity69			2
and @entity74 came along to make black citizens second - class and to ensure that neither truth - telling nor reconciliation would be on the agenda			1
consider our nation 50 years post-civil rights movement			2
that movement is sometimes called the @entity82			2
it sought to finish the fight to make truly equal citizens out of the descendants of slaves			2
but here we are today , still plagued @entity88 and @entity89 by divisions of color and caste -- and by an inability to talk about them without angry defensiveness			1
that 's why it 's worth asking whether the @entity6 today could take a page from @entity10 's script			1
@entity100 , a civil rights attorney and restorative justice activist in @entity102 , @entity103 , has proposed just that			2
in a widely circulated essay in @entity106 ! @entity107 , @entity100 argues that @entity108 , @entity109 , needs a @entity33 on extrajudicial violence against african - americans -- and that @entity6 does , too			0
you can hear the objections already			0
for instance : wo n't cataloging acts of racism from the past just make it harder for us all to get along ? but of course , racism is not only in the past			0
it did not end with the @entity123 of 1865 or with the @entity124			0
it is present in the acts and attitudes of many today			0
it is present in the institutional residue of past choices			0
that the phrase # @entity132 must be said says it all			0
the criminal justice system , the education system , the economic system and ( as this year 's so - white @entity138 remind us ) the pop culture system -- all of them value black lives , black voices and black experience less than fully			1
we must all face that fact			0
there 's also this objection to a commission : that by racializing everything it would basically be racist			1
consider the words of @entity153 chief justice @entity152 , who , arguing against affirmative action , once wrote that " [ t ] he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race			0
" this tidy tautology flattens out history			0
it obliterates the difference between injury and remedy			0
it wants to rush us along to a " colorblindness " that our society has n't yet earned and perhaps should n't even seek as an ideal			0
as a @entity176 , i am an inheritor of what white people wrote in the @entity179 and what they did to subvert it			0
i am the beneficiary of what black people and people of every color have done to redeem the @entity179			1
i am sometimes the object of a presumption that yellow people are presumed foreign until proven otherwise			0
i own the good , the bad and the ugly of this country			0
none of this is neat			0
none of it is colorblind either			0
ultimately the deepest objection to a racial truth and reconciliation process in @entity6 is that it would be hard			1
hard to start and to finish			0
we @entity6 can be a bit lazy when it comes to messy civic and historical truths			0
we want our stories -- and our story -- to have happy endings			0
we want reconciliation on the cheap			1
but the point of @entity5 , and of @entity210 's entire life , is that true redemption is never cheap or easy			1
so to honor him truly , let 's commit to what 's hard			1
whether through official commissions or citizen conversations , let 's face ourselves .			1

@entity219 : @entity210 lesson for all of us is that true redemption is never cheap or easy
*liu* : @entity224 , we *'re* still divided by color ; it 's time for reconciliation
