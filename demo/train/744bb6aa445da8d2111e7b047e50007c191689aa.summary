@entity72 vs. @entity73 sometimes you just loving watching the bad guy			0
on " @entity76 , " conniving @entity72 was forever squaring off against his good - guy brother @entity73			1
the show 's been resurrected with that battle at the center			0
but with @entity86 's death , @entity72 vs. @entity73 -- probably the biggest brother vs. brother rivalry in tv history -- will likely end as well , after the episodes @entity86 already shot for the new season that began this week			1
( coincidental corporate synergy alert : the new " @entity76 " is airing on @entity90 , which , like @entity0 , is a part of @entity92			0

( see also @entity108 , the @entity109 and more in this spread from @entity111			0

brotherly love trumps competition i 'll never forget watching the @entity130 as a kid			0
