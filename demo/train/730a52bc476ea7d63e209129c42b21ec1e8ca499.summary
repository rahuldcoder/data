-- he was born into poverty , became wealthy via the stock exchange , suffered the suicides of both his parents , and would ultimately end his own life on the golf course that bears his legacy			1
the life of @entity10 was remarkable tale , a man who -- in a rags - to - riches ode to the @entity14 -- rose from farm boy to the position of advisor for the @entity19 president via his role as creator of one of the most iconic golf courses in the world			1
as chairman of @entity26 , @entity10 would become legend , but the story of his life was one filled with twists and turns and which , ultimately , ended in tragedy on the banks of @entity35 's par - three course in september 1977			1
a triumph over adversity " @entity38 managed to rise above the tragedy of his parents			2
he was a land man and he traveled across the country , approaching farmers and buying their land for drilling rights , " said @entity40 , author of " the masters : @entity46			2
" " he made a real success and moved to @entity48 , where he got into stock brokerage and proved himself highly skilled in the art of ingratiating himself to people with money			2
he was as skilled with stocks and he was with ' the schmooze '			2
" it was in @entity48 that @entity10 befriended legendary amateur golfer @entity57 , who in 1930 completed the unique feat of a calendar @entity60 , by winning the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
@entity57 had retired from golf aged just 28 , with his celebrity at an all - time high			1
he sought money and sanctuary , and together with @entity10 conceived the idea of building an ultra-exclusive club in the more temperate south where monied @entity48 could head for retreat and rounds of golf in the sun. building a national treasure @entity35 , @entity77 , was familiar to both men			1
@entity10 had completed his @entity80 training at the town 's @entity82 facility , while @entity57 had a house nearby			1
@entity10 raised $ 70,000 to buy a @entity85 , 365 - acre @entity87 plantation , and the pair invited @entity90 designer dr. @entity89 to set out a golf course			1
" they built it for a dime , and got all their labor and materials for practically nothing , " said @entity40			2
" when they finished they declared bankruptcy , reorganized and gave themselves a new name			0
" the big sell @entity35 was ready in just 124 days , but it took a lot longer to sell the prospect to an @entity19 in the grips of recession			0
" @entity110 , the duo ( @entity10 and @entity57 ) failed to attract many early takers , and the club teetered on the brink of bankruptcy for years , " wrote @entity108 , in @entity109			1
in 1933 , @entity10 invited a group of wealthy business types to travel down from @entity48 by train			1
he paid for everything , and the carts were stocked generously with prohibition - flaunting whisky			0
but his greatest trick was launching the event that would put @entity35 on the map			0
a new kind of tournament it started life as the @entity129 in 1934 , before @entity10 finally convinced @entity57 on a name befitting of the tournament 's elitist home -- the masters			1
@entity57 came out of retirement to play , and @entity10 was made chairman			1
he immediately set about putting his stamp on the event			0
" he changed the locations of perimeter mounds to improve gallery viewing			0
he was the first to use a series of leader boards placed throughout the course			0
he also devised a system for showing the cumulative score of each player , " the history of the masters on the official web site reads			0
friends in high places the masters gave @entity10 new influence			1
in 1948 he invited a five - star general named @entity154 to visit @entity35			0
@entity10 would ultimately serve as @entity154 's political and financial advisor , and -- according to @entity40 's research -- help illegally distribute funds to the @entity158 en route to his election as president in 1953			1
" their relationship is told through @entity154 's oral history			0
@entity10 is open about being a bag man , and carrying satchels of cash around to avoid paperwork and detection , " @entity40 said			1
iron fist in a velvet glove the @entity173 relationship was widely seen as " good cop , bad cop " partnership			0
@entity40 called @entity10 an " iron fist in a velvet glove " , and the many stories of @entity10 ruthless pursuit of perfection at the course attests to this			1
" he ( @entity10 ) hated to see a dead tree limb or anything out of place , " said @entity184 , who 'll caddy in his 50th masters at the 2011 edition , in an interview with @entity109			1
" almost every time i would see him he would wave for me			0
he would say , ' you go and you tell that goddamn greens superintendent that i 'm out here on number 14 and to come out here this very minute			0
' " there was the incident in 1948 that @entity10 ejected @entity198 from @entity26 for hitting additional balls in a practice round			1
@entity198 claimed a conspiracy against him			0
and the fierce control he kept over television broadcasters , from the moment @entity26 went went live for the first time in 1956 with @entity206 persists in ethos to this day			1
barriers to entry but the controversy that defined @entity10 ' reign at @entity35 , was unquestionably the club 's apparent reticence to embrace black players -- and black members			1
the @entity216 dropped their @entity218 - only clause in 1961 , but it was 14 years before @entity220 became the first @entity221 to compete at @entity26			1
in the intervening years @entity222 won twice on the @entity223 , and applied time and again to be part of @entity26 field			1
product of the different era @entity35 under @entity10 occasionally was frequently compared to the plantation it was built on			2
the workers were black , the caddies were black , and they politely served the white folk who played and relaxed there			2
but was it really any more than a reflection of the society at the time ? " i do n't think @entity38 was motivated by racial issues at all , " @entity40 said			0
he was simply a product of the time and his environment			0
" the legacy of @entity57 and @entity10 when @entity57 succumbed to a debilitating illness in 1971 , @entity10 assumed total control of @entity35 , and of @entity26			1
his would preside over their legacy for another five years , before terminal illness led him to end his life on the golf course that defined it			2
typical of his ordered world , he had his haircut and attached the doctor 's note to a letter for his wife before shooting himself			0
a plaque was erected at the entrance to @entity35 , and his legacy continues to be fiercely protected at every turn by the club that made him chairman in memoriam			0
" although he was a tough man , he was a person who was truly dedicated to golf and the quality and standards of the game , " @entity264 reflected			2
" all of us in golf appreciate what he has done for the game , " said @entity269			2
" from the time i met @entity10 until his death , i never knew him to do anything that was not in the best interest of @entity35			2
as a youngster [ he ] would ask me what i thought of something , and i would try to give him an answer			0
he would then research it , come back to me and say , ' @entity269 , we agree and we are going to fix that on the golf course			2
' or , he would tell me why they did n't agree with me			0
" he was just a fun - loving guy ; a good guy			0
i love the story about the spoof he put on at one of the jamborees			0
they always said he could walk on water , and he rigged it so he could walk across the water at no. 16			0
. there was an age difference but we were good friends , " @entity269 told @entity109			0

@entity10 was born in @entity300 , @entity301 , and suffered the suicides of both his parents
having served in the @entity80 , he became a successful banker on @entity306
@entity10 and amateur golfer @entity57 conceived @entity309
