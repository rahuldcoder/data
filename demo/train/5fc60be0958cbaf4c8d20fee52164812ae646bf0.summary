-- the family of 13 - year - old @entity2 hopes to transfer the girl to another facility			1
a judge has concluded that @entity2 , who suffered complications after tonsil surgery , is brain dead			1
" yesterday we spent @entity10 together as a family -- doing a lot of prayers and trying to have some fun , hoping for a miracle , and looks like we may have gotten our miracle			0
we found out that someone is willing to take @entity2 away from @entity20 to a facility nearby here in the @entity23 to treat her , " @entity2 's uncle , @entity17 , told reporters thursday			1
" so right now , we 're asking @entity20 to work with us to make that possible , " he said , referring to @entity24			0
@entity17 declined to identify the other facility			0
@entity2 was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on december 12 , three days after tonsil surgery			1
the case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital should have provided better care			0
when routine surgeries go wrong on monday , a judge appointed dr. @entity39 , chief of pediatric neurology at @entity41 , to evaluate @entity2 as an independent expert			2
@entity39 testified tuesday that @entity2 meets the criteria for brain death			2
@entity46 judge @entity45 previously ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until december 30 , and the judge encouraged both sides to work together			0
family attorney @entity52 told reporters thursday that @entity2 would need to have tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes put in before she could be moved			2
" the most logical people are the ones in the hospital where she 's sitting who have the ability to do that			0
if they refuse to do that , and insist upon moving towards this deadline of pulling the plug , then we 'll just continue to do what we 've been doing , " he said			0
in response to the family 's statement , the hospital " will allow a lawful transfer of @entity2 's body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and @entity78 's can legally do so , " wrote hospital attorney @entity70 in a december 27 letter to @entity52			1
" children 's is willing to cooperate in this regard even though @entity85 has confirmed that @entity2 is deceased and that statutory patient transfer procedures do not apply here , " @entity70 wrote			1
the hospital asked the family 's attorney for the name of the facility that would accept @entity2 , a transportation plan for her , and consent from the @entity96 coroner for the " transfer since we are dealing with the body of a person who has been declared legally dead , " @entity70 wrote			1
the family will also have to " find a physician that would be willing to operate on the body , " said hospital spokesman @entity105			1
in an earlier response to the family , @entity20 chief of pediatrics @entity106 noted that the judge did n't authorize a transfer to another facility			1
" @entity85 was very clear on tuesday december 24			0
he ruled @entity2 to be deceased and instructed the hospital to maintain the status quo			2
judge @entity45 did not authorize or order any surgical procedures or transfer to another facility			2
" @entity20 does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice			0
@entity20 continues to extend its wishes for peace and closure to @entity2 's family , " he said			1
@entity0 's @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 contributed to this report .			0
