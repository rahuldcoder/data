@entity0 -- president @entity2 firmly laid out his plan thursday to " degrade and ultimately destroy " @entity4 , the terrorist organization that now controls large swaths of @entity6 and @entity7			1
but what did the @entity9 public think of the speech ? @entity1 's @entity12 broke down the results of @entity15 's " @entity14 , " where viewers reacted online in real time to the president 's address			0
overall , @entity9 gave the president 's speech high marks , but party lines bled through as @entity24 had a consistently more favorable perception throughout the speech			1
and independents stuck closely to @entity28 during the 15 - minute address			0
but all viewers rallied around one point in the speech : " @entity4 is a terrorist organization -- pure and simple -- and it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way			2
in a region that has known so much bloodshed , these terrorists are unique in their brutality , " @entity2 said			0
and the lowest point in the president 's speech came when he announced he was deploying an additional 475 @entity9 military advisers to @entity6			1
it seems the president 's assurances that @entity9 forces will not " have a combat mission " and the @entity9 would not get " dragged into another combat war in @entity6 " did n't make the troop buildup any more palatable			0
