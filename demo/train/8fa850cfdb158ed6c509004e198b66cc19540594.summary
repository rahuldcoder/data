" @entity1 " is not a very good movie			1
actually , it 's less of a movie than a horrific catalogue of everything that is miserable and boring in modern @entity6 : the urge to sequelize into infinity , the paycheck - gravitas of great @entity11 actors , the redefinition of " plot " as " a series of digitalized set - pieces signifying nothing , " the notion of @entity18 as an action hero , the notion that @entity21 still make interesting villains , the limits of @entity25 's greatness , but , most of all , the tv - ification of movie stardom , whereby every movie star is only really a star when they 're sleepwalking through reheated incarnations of their most iconic roles			1
( see also : @entity33 , @entity34 , everyone who has ever starred in a superhero movie besides @entity36 , the cast of " @entity38 , " the cast of " twilight			2
" ) but " @entity1 " was directed by @entity41 , who has almost certainly earned the right to strike out every now and then			1
@entity41 has been producing great , complex , entertaining @entity6 fare for 40 years now			1
you do n't just pick out your favorite @entity41 film ; you pick out your favorite @entity41 phase			1
do you prefer the " @entity48 " era , from 1975 ( " @entity49 " ) to 1982 ( " @entity50 " ) ? or perhaps the underrated " @entity58 " period , from 1984 ( " @entity51 " ) to 1991 ( " @entity52 " ) , which also includes @entity41 's work as the producer of " gremlins , " " the @entity56 , " and " @entity57 " ? some people dig the " revival " period , when he made the " important " trilogy ( " @entity63 , " " @entity64 , " " @entity65 " ) and mixed in a couple " @entity68 " movies , why not ? personally , i dig @entity41 's " @entity72 " period , from 2001 ′ s totally weird @entity75 mash - up " @entity73 " through a brilliant post- 9/11 @entity77 duet up to the incisive thriller " @entity79			1
" that 's a great run that ended with " @entity1 , " but in a new interview with @entity82 , @entity41 sounds pretty serene about the " @entity84 " fourquel			1
that 's not to say he does n't understand that people have a gripe with the central plot point of the film , which you 'll recall forced @entity91 to run around the jungle waving a @entity1 and yelling " @entity1 ! @entity1 ! @entity1 ! " for 90 minutes			1
" i sympathize with people who did n't like the @entity94 because i never liked the @entity94 , " says @entity41			2
" @entity95 [ @entity96 ] and i had big arguments about the @entity94			2
" ah , but do n't think for a moment that @entity41 is joining in the popular @entity100 sporting event of hating on @entity96			2
" i am loyal to my best friend , " he says			0
" when he writes a story he believes in -- even if i do n't believe in it -- i 'm going to shoot the movie the way @entity95 envisaged it			0
" so basically , this is a classic example of an awesome filmmaker deferring to a decidedly less awesome filmmaker , purely out of friendship			0
( sort of like whenever @entity113 works with @entity114 , or when @entity115 took some peyote with @entity117 and @entity117 was all like , " @entity119 , man , you should totally make a movie about dreams , man ! " and the result was @entity124			0
) @entity41 happily admits that the most infamous scene in @entity1 belongs to him : " what people really jumped at was @entity84 climbing into a refrigerator and getting blown into the sky by an atom - bomb blast			1
that was my silly idea			0
people stopped saying ' jump the shark			0
' they now say , ' nuked the fridge			0
' i 'm proud of that			0
i 'm glad i was able to bring that into popular culture			0
" anyhow , the point is that @entity41 feels your pain , and now we can all have a good laugh , and while we 're laughing , we can take a good hard look the first decade of the new millennium , and ponder the fact that we lived through a moment when @entity96 ' silly ideas were regularly turned into $ 200 million movies			2
