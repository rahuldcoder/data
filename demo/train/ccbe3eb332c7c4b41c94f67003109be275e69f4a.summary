@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 keeps his @entity5 assault rifle propped up on the seat of his patrol vehicle			1
the car snakes along a dirt road about a half - mile from the @entity11 border			2
he 's always kept the rifle within arm 's reach			2
but in recent weeks , staying armed at all times has taken on a new urgency : @entity11 cartels have issued death threats against the police on the @entity0 force			1
his car rolls to a stop			2
@entity24 steps out and points to a nearby hillside where a rusty fence cuts through the desert landscape , separating the @entity28 from @entity11			2
" i would not doubt it right now -- we 're being watched , " @entity24 says			2
at 51 , @entity24 is a member of the @entity32 's swat team			2
he 's patrolled the community since he was 20			2
over the past three decades , he 's seen this region in southeastern @entity1 become a drug corridor for @entity11 cartels			1
drug runners speed through the canyons , using tree lines to sneak their loot in and out of @entity11			1
" they load up and load out , and then they 're gone , " he says			2
he has relatives across the border , but he has n't been to family gatherings in @entity11 for three years			1
it 's too risky -- an @entity28 police officer fetches a high price for cartel kidnappings			1
" i 've always tried to be careful , " he says			0
" i never underestimate the cartels in @entity11			2
i take it very serious			0
i keep a low profile			0
" the cartel hit men are ruthless , and he says some were trained by @entity55 to help @entity11 fight the drug war , until they went to the other side			1
" that is what we 're up against			0
" the recent death threats -- the first ever by @entity11 cartels on the police here -- came after two recent busts by off - duty officers			1
in the first case , two officers were riding horseback when they intercepted a van full of marijuana			0
a few days later , the same officers were roping cattle with a crowd of cowboys when they spotted a vehicle with bundles of pot being tossed into the trunk and backseat			0
the off - duty officers detained two men and called in support			0
" that was gutsy , " says @entity24			0
the busts netted about $ 600,000 in marijuana -- relatively small potatoes in the underworld of drug trafficking			2
yet the cartels responded swiftly with a message for @entity0 police : when you 're not in uniform , you better look the other way or you 'll be targeted			1
the message was relayed to police through an informant			2
" they named the @entity0 police department officers that were in that area off duty , " says police chief @entity97			1
" they are not happy , and they are desperate to get that across			1
" " we 're not going to be intimidated , " adds @entity97 , the police chief for the last six months			1
" we 're going to continue with our operations			0
in fact , we 're going to step up our operations			0
" @entity0 , population 24,000 , is the largest border town in this region			1
its downtown is a vibrant community with a @entity115 feel			0
@entity11 and @entity28 flags hang outside storefronts			0
a quaint plaza is filled with children and parents alike			0
outside of town , homes are built just a few feet from the fence dividing the two nations			2
@entity11 neighbors live directly on the other side			0
and while the region is a major drug corridor , @entity0 has an extremely low crime rate			1
there has only been one murder in the past three years			1
by contrast , the police chief says , just across the border there have already been 126 drug - related murders this year			1
police say the cartels are being squeezed at the border and the drug lords are angry their profits are being cut into			1
more than $ 10 million in drugs have been confiscated in @entity142 this year			0
and last year , the town of @entity0 captured headlines when @entity28 @entity146 agents found a sophisticated drug - smuggling tunnel that went under the border fence			1
the 60 - member @entity0 police force has now been told to keep weapons on them at all times			1
they 're even encouraged to wear body armor when off duty			0
the officers remain in constant communication so their whereabouts are known			0
" this is the first time @entity0 police officers have ever been threatened by anyone in drug trafficking , " says chief @entity97			1
" i take a death threat any time against a police officer -- locally , federally or state -- as very serious			1
" at one point , while @entity24 is speaking with @entity2 , he turns down his radio for a few minutes			0
the department issues an all - points bulletin for him			0
" it 's very dangerous			0
you have to be very careful , " he says			0
the lifelong resident of @entity0 then climbs back into his police car			1
dust kicks up along the barren road			0
@entity2 's @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
