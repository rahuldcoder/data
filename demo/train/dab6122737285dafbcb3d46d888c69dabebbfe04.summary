-- an icy asteroid orbiting the sun between @entity3 and @entity4 is adding credence to theories that @entity8 's water was delivered from space , according to a report published in the new issue of the science journal @entity13			2
two teams of scientists found their evidence when looking at 24 @entity17 , a asteroid about 479 million kilometers ( 300 million miles ) from the sun , or roughly three times the average distance from @entity8 to the sun. using the infrared telescope at @entity23 , @entity24 , they were surprised to find not only water on 24 @entity17 , but organic compounds as well			1
asteroids were thought to be devoid of water because they sit too close to the sun , while comets have been the water bearers of the universe because they form farther out in space			0
" astronomers have looked at dozens of asteroids with this technique , but this is the first time we 've seen ice on the surface and organics , " astronomer @entity42 of the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , told @entity33			0
the scientific teams from @entity47 and the @entity48 that looked at 24 @entity17 speculate that the ice may be held in a reservoir under the asteroid 's surface			2
they speculate that the water is brought to the surface as small bodies in the asteroid belt hit the surface of 24 @entity17			1
the findings on 24 @entity17 lend weight to the idea that asteroids and comets are the source of @entity8 's water and organic material			1
geochemists believe that early @entity8 went through a molten phase that would have removed any organic molecules , meaning any new organic material would have had to come to the planet at a later time , said @entity73 at @entity48			0
" i believe our findings are linked to the origin of life on @entity8 , " he added			0
scientists now plan to scan the asteroid belt for more evidence of water and organic materials , hoping to determine if 24 @entity17 is just an interloper -- possibly a comet that got caught in the asteroid belt -- or the first of many water - bearing asteroids that will change the way astronomers look at the solar system			1
" the old - fashioned picture of the solar system in which asteroids are asteroids and comets are comets is getting harder to sustain , " @entity42 said .			0

report : scientists find first evidence of water on asteroid
organic compounds were also found on 24 @entity17
asteroids were once thought not to contain water because they were too close to sun
