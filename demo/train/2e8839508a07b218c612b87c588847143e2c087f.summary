-- thousands of taxpayers across the country are n't getting their refund or stimulus checks because criminals have stolen their social security numbers in an identity theft scam , @entity0 has learned			1
some victims do n't learn about identity theft until the @entity10 questions them about income in their name			1
" we see a lot of activity right now , because clearly folks who are trying to perpetrate a fraud have to get their claims in early before a true taxpayer files their return , " said @entity13 , the national taxpayer advocate for the @entity10			1
@entity13 , whose independent office is set up to help taxpayers , said her office fielded several thousand complaints this year connected to the scam			2
the @entity27 reported that approximately 50,000 taxpayers complained about tax fraud and employment - related identity theft during 2006 , compared with 18,000 in 2002			1
" it 's a huge nightmare , " @entity13 said			0
" basically , their life can be taken over by just about every approach , trying to prove that they are who they are and other people are not			0
and when you think about how central the social security number is to banking , to credit , to school applications , for financial aid , just for everything you can think of -- plus your taxes -- it has a significant impact on a person 's life			0
" that 's what happened to @entity53 , a 25 - year - old father and student from @entity55 , @entity56			2
@entity53 said he was 17 when someone stole his wallet at a ski resort			0
over the past four years , at least five people have used his social security number to report income			0
and since the criminals earned income on his number and never paid taxes , he and his wife , @entity63 , ca n't get any tax refunds from the @entity10 or their government stimulus check even though he reported the theft several years ago to police and the @entity10			1
under the government 's economic stimulus plan , 130 million people were supposed to received tax rebate checks from $ 300 and up last year			1
" we want to put that money in the bank , " @entity75 said			0
" we want to be able to put money down on a home			0
" the @entity81 said the ordeal has been frustrating because they know when they file their tax return every year that they wo n't get the money back that they are owed			1
initially , they said , it was difficult dealing with the @entity10 , which they said made @entity53 feel as if he were the criminal			1
" the fear is it will happen for the rest of our lives , " @entity53 said			0
sen. @entity93 , @entity94 , said it takes the @entity10 an average of about a year " to sort out who is the real taxpayer			1
" " in the meantime , the victim 's tax accounts get frozen , " @entity93 , the chairman of the @entity98 , said in a written statement			0
" the @entity10 issues no refund			2
the money that the taxpayer was planning on does n't come			0
the taxpayer waits in tax limbo , for months and months			0
" @entity93 , who led a hearing into the issue in 2008 , said other taxpayers do n't learn that they are victims of identity theft until years later			1
" victims first realize that other people are using their identities when the @entity10 contacts them			2
the @entity10 asks them why they did not report the income that appears on @entity119 forms with their names on them , " he said			2
and sen. @entity121 , the ranking @entity122 on @entity93 ' committee , said the @entity10 does n't do enough to combat tax - related identity theft			1
he said the @entity10 does not prosecute , " and that 's not very helpful			2
it sends a signal that you get a free pass if you 're using @entity10 instruments			2
" but @entity10 spokesman @entity131 called preventing identity theft " a top priority " for federal tax collectors and said , " we are committing significant resources to address the challenges posed in protecting taxpayers ' identity information			1
" " we have established a special unit dedicated to resolving tax issues incurred by identity theft victims and special tracking codes to monitor returns and prevent further fraud , " @entity131 said in a written statement			1
" potential identity theft victims can contact the @entity10 if they suspect fraud			1
" the @entity10 said it " vigorously prosecutes identity thieves to the fullest extent of the law using tax - related laws that result in the toughest penalties possible			1
" the agency said it was unable to provide details of how many cases it prosecuted , however			0
in the meantime , the @entity81 have signed up with @entity159 , a private company that helps identity - theft victims			2
@entity161 , the company 's ceo , said cases like theirs are " like getting a disease that 's incurable			0
" " look , once your information has been compromised , it 's not like when they steal your car , " @entity161 said			0
" once they steal your car , you file a police report , you do an insurance claim or whatever it may be , you get your replacement car , it 's over			0
once they have your personal information , as exemplified by this couple in @entity56 , this information could be used over and over by multiple people			0

tax fraud reports jump between 2002 and 2006 , @entity27 reports
senator says it can take a year for @entity10 to sort out identity theft
@entity188 says that preventing such fraud is a priority
