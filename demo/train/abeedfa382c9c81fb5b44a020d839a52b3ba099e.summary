-- we 've come a long way since my early days as the associate medical director of the @entity6 clinic at @entity7 in the 1980s and 1990s			1
by 1990 , i had seen over 500 patients die from a disease that we just could n't treat			0
as an infectious disease doctor , i was overcome not only by the tragic loss of life , but also by the inability to find the " magic bullet " to help prevent these deaths			0
like many of my colleagues , i devoted my time to caring for my patients and to research			0
i am proud to say that many of the successful antiretroviral treatments ( @entity22 ) that were developed emerged from @entity7			0
hiv / aids treatment was then , and remains today , a true game - changer in saving lives			1
in the early 1990s , we made unprecedented progress in addressing @entity6 in the @entity28 by putting people on treatment			1
yet , when i traveled to @entity31 in the mid- 1990s , i was devastated to see what was happening there			0
@entity6 was literally destroying an entire generation , and eroding the very foundation of many @entity37 nations			1
at that time , 85 % of the burden of disease was in @entity31 and less than 5 % of the treatment capability was there			2
that was when i realized that devoting my energies solely to international work was the natural evolution of my career			0
i was determined that this history of lives needlessly lost would not be repeated			0
we could not -- and our country has not -- turn our backs on the suffering that was right in front of us			0
today , as president @entity53 makes this historic trip to @entity31 , we are at a point where an aids - free generation is within sight			0
with the world 's largest number of people living with @entity61 and @entity6 ( 5.6 million ) , @entity37 has always been on the front lines of the epidemic			1
the @entity28 government 's response to the epidemic in @entity37 began in 2003 when non-governmental organizations initiated the provision of @entity22 in october 2009 , the tide truly began to turn when @entity37 president @entity70 declared : " we need to move with urgency and purpose to confront this enormous challenge ... most importantly , all @entity37 need to know their @entity61 status , and be informed of the treatment options available to them			1
" the @entity37 government , with support from the @entity28 president 's @entity79 ( @entity79 ) and the @entity80 to fight @entity6 , @entity81 ( @entity81 ) and @entity82 , has saved hundreds of thousands of @entity37 lives			1
to date , we have joined forces to provide 7 million @entity37 with @entity61 testing and counseling , conducted over 170,000 voluntary medical male circumcisions for @entity61 prevention , and supported more than 1.6 million on @entity22 and @entity37 has reduced the rate of mother - to - child transmission of @entity61 at six weeks of life dramatically -- from 8.7 % in 2008 to 2.7 % in 2011			2
@entity79 has invested $ 3.7 billion in supporting @entity37 's hiv / aids efforts			1
as @entity37 's battle against @entity6 has evolved , so has @entity79 's support			1
last year , we signed an agreement to make our partnership based on co-investment , showcasing @entity37 's leadership in caring for and treating its own people			1
as @entity28 funding shifts increasingly to hiv prevention , health systems strengthening and technical support -- @entity37 is expanding its own investments in the care and treatment of @entity61 and @entity81			1
with the @entity37 government in the lead -- coordinating planning and alignment of implementation with @entity79 , the @entity80 , and other development partners -- will we see reduced costs and increased access to health and social services			1
these new partnerships with high - burden countries , forged by the @entity53 administration , have been a driving force in our collective push to achieve an @entity6 - free generation			2
they allow @entity79 to invest its resources where they are most needed -- in those countries whose governments do not yet have the capacity to provide critical services for their citizens			2
last week , i attended a 10th anniversary celebration of @entity79 with @entity28 secretary of state @entity131 , at which he announced that the one - millionth baby will be born @entity61 - free this month , thanks to @entity79			2
one million babies in 10 years			0
today , i am proud to stand with president @entity53 and archbishop @entity138 at one of the pioneering youth and @entity61 centers in @entity142			0
thanks to the dedication of president @entity144 , president @entity53 and bipartisan support from the @entity146 -- what a difference a decade has made			0
