@entity0 -- do n't expect president @entity2 or @entity4 presidential candidate @entity3 to talk about the issue of gun control in the wake of last week 's deadly mass shooting in @entity9 , @entity10 -- there 's little to gain from bringing up the issue			1
while gun rights issues are split along party lines , independents , who will determine the outcome of the election , are also divided over the issue			1
both men and their surrogates have steered clear of discussing thorny @entity23 issues since the shootings			1
polls , such as one conducted by the @entity27 in april , have found that 55 % of highly coveted independents feel it is " more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns , " with 40 % saying controlling gun ownership is more important			1
the poll also found that 72 % of @entity4 feel protecting gun ownership is important , while 27 % of @entity34 feel that way			1
this tracks with similar polls conducted after other mass shootings such as last year 's assassination attempt on rep. @entity40 , @entity41 , in @entity42 in which six people were killed			0
a @entity27 poll conducted after the shooting found that " 49 % of @entity47 say it is more important to protect the rights of @entity47 to own guns , while 46 % say it is more important to control gun ownership			1
" and the issue likely wo n't play well in a battleground state such as @entity10 , with its culture of strong and proud gun ownership but a recent history of deadly mass shootings such as friday 's theater massacre and a similar event in 1999 at @entity59 , said @entity60 , dean and professor at the @entity62 at @entity64 's @entity63			1
" it 's political suicide to " to advocate greater gun control in @entity10 , @entity60 said			2
@entity10 is also a state with a fast - growing segment of independent voters , according to a study by the @entity71 , a @entity0 - based , moderate - leaning think tank			0
" no politician in their right mind would say anything about gun control in @entity10 because you simply wo n't get it , " said @entity60 , who grew up in @entity72 , @entity10			2
" growing up i did n't know anyone who did n't own a gun			0
" so despite @entity83 mayor @entity82 , an independent , calling for @entity2 and @entity3 to debate gun issues , the two candidates are unlikely to move gun policy discussions from anything more than a back - burner debate			1
that 's because in moving the conversation about guns front and center both politicians could get burned			0
@entity3 has had a mixed history on the issue of gun control , according to the @entity98 - winning @entity97 website , which grades the accuracy of political comments			1
" during his campaigns for statewide @entity104 office , @entity3 openly spoke of his support for -- to use his words from 2002 -- ' tough gun laws , ' " @entity97 found			1
during the 2008 @entity4 primaries , @entity3 said , " i do n't line up 100 percent with the @entity109			2
" however , the @entity4 presidential hopeful 's " pro-gun rhetoric has become sharper and virtually all nuance was erased			0
he even touted the bill he signed in @entity104 by scrubbing any reference to the provisions banning assault weapons , " the site found			0
the site noted that " even in the 1994 campaign ( @entity3 ) did n't take a full - blown , pro-gun - control stand			1
" and though @entity3 's messaging sounds more pro-gun , he " has never gone so far as to specifically renounce his prior positions , such as his signing of the 2004 @entity104 law , " an assault weapons ban mirrored after a similar federal ban			2
@entity3 earned a " @entity131 " from the site for messaging on guns that " has been more on the rhetorical level than substantive			2
" meanwhile , @entity34 long gave up the messaging battle on guns			0
" democrats finally figured out that this was an issue that they were getting walloped on in many @entity144 , @entity143 states and many swing states , " said @entity134 , who worked in the @entity135 for more than 20 years as a top aide to @entity34 sen. @entity137 and @entity135 majority leader @entity138			0
" so they began a subtle shift to try to coordinate and / or get more pro-gun @entity34 to run			0
" he said , " for many @entity34 , it 's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate			2
" talk of gun rights was largely absent from @entity2 's speech in the aftermath of the @entity156 shooting in 2009 and after @entity40 and others were shot in @entity41 last year			1
@entity2 mentioned gun safety only in passing after the @entity42 shootings to describe the polarizing nature of the issue			1
the president penned an opinion piece two months after the @entity42 shootings that acknowledged the importance of the @entity23 and called for a " focus " on " effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible , law - breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place			2
" political discourse on guns is unlikely to increase since polls indicate @entity47 do n't want to make gun laws more strict and overall gun violence has actually decreased , said @entity177 , an associate professor of public policy and political science at @entity180 and author of " disarmed : the @entity182 for @entity183 in @entity47			0
" " historically the pro control side has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative that will help people come over to the case of stricter gun control laws , " @entity177 said			0
" for a long time these gun violence rates and massacres speak for themselves			0
they relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful but very well - disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart			0
" @entity1 's @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0

president @entity2 , @entity3 are unlikely to tread further into thorny gun rights , control issues
@entity204 *fairly* divided on issue of protecting gun ownership
both @entity3 and @entity2 have a *complicated* history on gun issues
