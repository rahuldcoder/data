-- @entity1 thought that he 'd been careful , working diligently in his job as an @entity4 sergeant , and staying quiet about his outside life , including his sexual orientation			1
then , a female cadet went to his commander , with the revelation that @entity1 -- who had been first in his @entity12 pilot 's training class and long aspired to a military career -- was gay			1
soon thereafter , in 2002 , he was discharged , the life - long military brat 's dreams of being a pilot suddenly dashed			1
" it was stunning , disappointing , " @entity1 said of being outed , and ousted , despite " doing everything that the @entity4 had asked of me			1
" " i lost everything that i had been working for			0
" but starting tuesday , @entity1 's future could take another turn			2
that 's when the @entity24 is set to formally repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that has been in place since 1993			1
advocates for the change overcame intense opposition from some who claimed allowing gay men and women to serve openly would hurt the military by making other troops uncomfortable and less effective , hurting morale and the military as a whole			1
and it also survived a last - minute push by two of the most powerful republicans on the @entity42 to keep the policy in place			2
" there were many times when we thought it was n't going to happen , " said @entity44 , chief legislative counsel for the @entity45			2
" ( tuesday ) is a tremendous day for ( gay rights advocates )			2
" so , too , will be the days to follow			0
@entity1 , who joined the @entity4 in 1996 , said he 's already been in touch with a recruiter , as he 's actively considering returning to the military			2
" my views of the military have never changed , i 've always loved the military , " he said			2
" it is great ( the law is no longer in effect ) , because it is going to make the military stronger			1
" the policy , which became known as @entity59 , was extremely controversial when it first took shape			2
during his presidential campaign , @entity62 had vowed to let gays fight alongside straight people			2
but under intense pressure from conservatives fearful that such a policy would hurt the military 's effectiveness , the compromise was crafted			1
under it , military officials could not ask a soldier , sailor or airman about his or her sexual preferences			2
but if the troop 's orientation came to light , it could lead to their discharge from the military			2
some , like @entity1 , claim they never brought anything up themselves to their superiors , but still were forced to leave			0
since its inception , the @entity88 -- which @entity1 now works for -- estimates more than 14,000 people were kicked out of the military due to " @entity59 , " with the highest rates occurring in 2000 and 2001			2
the advocacy group said that its figures come from @entity24 statistics , obtained via @entity96 requests			0
efforts on monday to reach several organizations that opposed the policy 's repeal were unsuccessful			1
but those on the other side of the debate described @entity59 as discriminatory			0
" this is one of two remaining federal laws where the government says , in point - blank terms : gay people are treated one way , and straight people are treated another way , " said @entity108 , direction of the @entity112 's @entity111 project , adding that the other law is the @entity114			0
" discrimination is written right into the face of law			0
" while serving , @entity1 said that it became " a game " for him and many other closeted military personnel , realizing " at work , i do n't talk about my personal life			1
" but in time , and after his discharge , the @entity129 sergeant said that he came to the realization that " the military was behind on this issue			1
" " they do n't like change , and they do n't want change unless they have to do it , " he said			1
still , @entity140 , the executive director of the @entity141 -- a gay rights group , does n't expect the change to create major ripples			1
" sure there 's going to be some homophobia here and there , but at the end of the day , if you 're a service member , you are expected to be a professional , " he said			0
" @entity150 wo n't be tolerated and it wo n't be allowed			0
" racial integration and the inclusion of women in the armed forces were bigger cultural steps , @entity140 said			0
by 2011 , the militaries of several countries -- including @entity159 and @entity161 allies like @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 -- allowed gays to serve openly			1
and public opinion began to shift as well			0
in a @entity168 poll from december 2010 -- the same month a lame - duck @entity169 approved the repeal -- 67 % of respondents favored a similar policy in the @entity174 , with 28 % dissenting			1
" over the last 17 years , the country has learned a lot more about gay people , " said @entity108			0
" as a whole , it is much more comfortable with the fact that gay people exist			0
" even so , the effort led by president @entity184 to repeal the law was n't without roadblocks			1
sen. @entity187 , an @entity189 @entity188 and former war hero , was among those opposed , saying at a @entity193 hearing , " at this time , we should be inherently cautious about making any changes that would affect our military , and what changes we do make should be the product of careful and deliberate consideration			0
" yet the @entity24 , despite reported dissent within its ranks , pushed for the change			0
on december 22 , 2010 , @entity184 signed the repeal into law			1
but this did n't set off an instantaneous change			1
instead , the @entity24 rolled out a months - long process that would involve new training and rules , as well as a confirmation that it would not harm " military readiness			1
" until that time , the policy officially remained in effect			0
last week , rep. @entity214 , @entity215 , the chairman of the @entity193 , and rep. @entity217 , @entity219 - @entity218 , the chairman of the committee 's personnel subcommittee , hoped to keep it that way when they wrote defense secretary @entity225 asking him to " take immediate action to delay the implementation of repeal			0
" they claimed @entity169 has not been adequately informed of policy changes that will accompany the repeal			1
a defense official who handles questions about the policy said that the department would not respond to a congressional letter via the media			0
but a spokesperson sent @entity0 a statement that read , in part , " the repeal of ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' will occur , in accordance with the law and after a rigorous certification process , on september 20			1
" the statement added that " senior @entity24 officials have advised @entity169 of changes to regulations and policies associated with repeal " -- including offering specific regulations and new policies in meetings with @entity255 staff			0
@entity256 , while claiming that gay , lesbian and transgender people still face " a great deal of legal and cultural discrimination , " nonetheless called the law 's formal repeal " a tipping point in the movement for equality			1
" @entity108 agreed , even as he predicted that the concept that people could n't fly planes , sail on @entity272 ships or fight in battle just because of their sexual orientation will seem antiquated in a few decades			0
" there will be a lot of people who will look back and scratch their heads , and say why were people so worried ? " he said			0
" it does n't mesh with their experience of @entity174			0
" @entity0 's @entity283 and @entity284 contributed to this report .			0

the repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy will become final on tuesday
the law , barring gays from serving openly in the military , was *enacted* in 1993
@entity184 signed a bill repealing it in late 2010 , setting off a *transition* process
an @entity129 sergeant outed by the policy says the military often does n't like change
