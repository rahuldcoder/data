-- the @entity2 @entity1 has upheld an incontestable verdict on the conduct of the major cigarette companies over four decades : they are racketeers who carried out a conspiracy to deceive the public and target children with their deadly and addictive products			1
the court on monday declined to accept appeals from either side in the massive case that began when the @entity17 filed suit against the tobacco companies in 1999			0
although the @entity21 administration and public health groups failed to persuade the justices to reconsider earlier rulings that limited the financial penalties and remedial measures the trial court ordered , the @entity1 left intact the trial court 's damning judgment : the tobacco industry has illegally profited from selling products that cause disease and death			1
the @entity1 's decision puts the responsibility squarely on elected officials to eliminate the tobacco industry 's harmful influence and take effective action to protect the nation 's health			1
@entity42 and the @entity21 administration should fund a national public education and stop - smoking campaign , and the @entity46 must effectively exercise its new authority to regulate tobacco products			1
state officials must redouble efforts to implement proven tobacco - control measures , including higher tobacco taxes , comprehensive smoke - free workplace laws and well - funded prevention programs			1
the case stemmed from @entity2 district court judge @entity58 's landmark 2006 decision that found the cigarette makers guilty of violating civil provisions of the @entity61 ( @entity61 )			0
@entity58 found that they had acted illegally when they " lied , misrepresented and deceived the @entity2 public , including smokers and the young people they avidly sought as ' replacement ' smokers , about the devastating health effects of smoking and environmental tobacco smoke			1
" the companies , @entity58 concluded , " have marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal , with deception , with a single - minded focus on their financial success , and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted			2
" in short , they perpetrated the deadliest consumer fraud in history			0
and , @entity58 found , they continue their deceptions to this day			0
the tobacco industry spends nearly $ 13 billion annually -- $ 35 million every single day -- to market its deadly and addictive products , often in ways that appeal to kids			1
as smoking rates have declined and restrictions on smoking have multiplied , the industry has introduced new smokeless tobacco products and significantly increased marketing for them			1
some of these products look like candy , are flavored like candy and have colorful packaging like candy			0
they are easily concealed in settings such as classrooms			0
even as the @entity46 begins to exercise its new authority over tobacco products , the industry concocts new schemes to thwart the regulations			2
tobacco companies have sought to evade the new ban on deceptive " light " and " low - tar " labels by introducing lighter - colored packaging for light brands and switching to terms such as " gold " and " silver " to replace " light " and " ultra-light			2
" the color - coded packs seek to perpetuate the falsehood that some cigarette brands are less harmful than others			0
each time state and local governments consider smoke - free workplace laws , the tobacco industry recycles baseless arguments against these measures , which are proved to protect health			1
every time states consider raising tobacco taxes -- a proven way to reduce smoking , especially among teenagers -- the industry seeks to manipulate public opinion with bogus claims and calculated alliances with less controversial political groups			1
for example , in @entity146 this year , @entity145 promoted a rally that ostensibly was organized by anti-tax organizations			0
@entity151 's role was exposed when the @entity152 discovered this fine print at the bottom of a rally invitation : " paid for by @entity156 on behalf of @entity145			2
" these continuing actions make it urgent for the trial court to impose the remedies first ordered in 2006			2
they include requiring the tobacco companies to make corrective statements about the health risks of smoking and secondhand smoke and their deceptive practices			0
these statements must appear in newspaper and television advertising , on the companies ' web sites and on cigarette packaging			0
the trial court also ordered the tobacco companies to report marketing data annually to the government , demanded public disclosure of more internal documents and prohibited the companies from committing acts of racketeering or making false , misleading or deceptive statements about cigarettes and their health risks			2
tobacco use is the nation 's leading cause of preventable death , claiming more than 400,000 lives and costing $ 96 billion in health - care expenditures each year			1
elected leaders can no longer stand idly by while the tobacco companies continue to engage in unlawful activity and harm public health			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity198 : @entity200 upholds racketeering ruling on @entity151 , which lied to public
@entity198 says it 's time to fund education and stop - smoking campaigns
tobacco industry spends $ 35 million daily to market its deadly products , @entity198 writes
@entity151 *undermines* laws to control it , he says , so it 's urgent to impose remedies
