@entity0 -- equal pay for women , raising the minimum wage , immigration reform , combating climate change and virtually swearing off extended wars			0
all are catnip for the political left , and all were highlighted by president @entity12 this week as he informally launched the november election campaign for 36 @entity15 seats and a new @entity16			1
by flying the @entity18 banner so high in tuesday 's @entity20 address and subsequent road show to four states , @entity12 tried to signal unity with his liberal base and provide the party 's candidates with ammunition for elections certain to be " spirited " -- the @entity0 euphemism for fierce and nasty			1
" the president wants to highlight differences between the parties and show that @entity18 are on the side of ordinary people , " said @entity30 , the vice president for governance studies at the @entity31			1
" that 's how he won in 2012 , and that 's the strategy in 2014			0
" focus on women , minorities hence the emphasis on policies that benefit women and minorities and appeal to younger voters			0
on tuesday and in subsequent speeches in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity12 called for equal pay for women and made sure to include references to the popular first lady			2
" when women succeed @entity56 succeeds , " he said thursday in @entity54 , @entity48			0
" and by the way , when women succeed , men succeed			0
i do n't know about all the guys here , but you know when @entity63 is doing good and happy , i am happy , too			0
i 'm just sayin '			0
" the president also called in his @entity20 speech for raising the minimum wage from $ 7.25 an hour to $ 10.10 , taking the first step himself by announcing he will unilaterally give the raise to workers under federal contracts			2
@entity71 oppose the move in allegiance to their business supporters			0
according to @entity76 political scientist @entity75 , @entity12 is focusing " on all the things that can help folks immediately , even if the impact is small			0
" " positioning the @entity18 as the party of the working man and woman is old school but absolutely necessary if they are going to successfully counter the @entity71 resurgence among working class and independent voters , especially women , " @entity75 told @entity1			1
@entity12 's ' @entity90 ' remark she cited a remark from @entity12 's speech tuesday that received prolonged applause from legislators jamming the packed @entity16 chamber -- the president 's call for ending unfair workplace policies for women " that belong in a ' @entity90 ' episode			1
" " when both the @entity18 and @entity71 members of @entity104 stood up and applauded after the famous ' @entity90 episode ' quote , it was clear that each party sees women as the crucial swing factor in the 2014 elections , " @entity75 said			1
on the @entity71 side , she described the choice of rep. @entity113 of @entity0 to deliver the party 's formal response tuesday night as " smart politics			2
" @entity12 's re-election victory in 2012 owed much to a solid majority among women voters , including independents turned off by hardline anti-abortion policies of @entity71			1
the @entity18 - fueled accusation of a @entity71 " war on women " gained traction with infamous missteps by @entity71 candidates such as former rep. @entity128 of @entity129 , who claimed that women rarely get pregnant from " legitimate " rape			1
@entity128 lost his bid to unseat @entity18 sen. @entity133 in the @entity129			0
now a concerted @entity71 outreach to women voters means @entity18 " ca n't just count on another @entity128 to save the @entity15 in 2014 , " @entity75 said , adding that " they all have to work to produce federal policies that help working families in order to sustain that advantage			1
" @entity71 must walk the talk @entity30 said @entity71 must follow stated intentions with action when it comes to diversifying their policies and supporters			0
" they have to become something other than the party of angry white men , " he said , adding the @entity71 also must make " meaningful changes in public policy " because " they ca n't spin their way out of political problems by highlighting women and minorities			2
" while specifying issues advantageous to @entity18 , @entity12 also has jabbed at @entity71 this week on another matter that resonates with voters -- the perception that political intransigence led by tea party conservatives stymies progress in @entity0			1
republicans got the blame for last year 's highly unpopular 16 - day government shutdown when conservatives led by @entity71 sen. @entity168 of @entity169 tried to link a funding measure to dismantling the 2010 health care reforms they detest			2
to @entity12 , @entity71 must decide " whether they 're going to waste time creating new crises that slow things down , or whether they 're going to spend time creating new jobs and opportunity , " he said thursday			1
in what he depicted as a presidential declaration of independence from congressional dysfunction , @entity12 said " i want to work with them , but i ca n't wait for them			0
" immigration reform another topic : reforming the immigration system , with @entity12 and @entity18 seeking a path to legal status for the millions of people living illegally in the country			1
@entity71 are desperate to reduce the @entity18 advantage among @entity194 , the nation 's largest minority demographic			1
but @entity16 @entity71 remain unlikely to support a comprehensive @entity15 plan that passed with bipartisan support and has @entity12 's backing			1
instead , house speaker @entity200 and other @entity71 call for a piecemeal approach to try to show empathy with @entity203 while avoiding a backlash by conservatives that would worsen an already damaging internal @entity71 rift			2
on other issues , @entity12 reiterated his push for unspecified action against climate change and made clear that with the @entity212 war finally winding down , he has no intention of committing @entity56 to another prolonged engagement			2
" i will not send our troops into harm 's way unless it is truly necessary ; nor will i allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open - ended conflicts , " he said			0
" we must fight the battles that need to be fought , not those that terrorists prefer from us			0
" he also refused to back down from withering criticism from the political right about the health care reforms known as @entity230 , offering a strong defense of the benefits and telling republicans to quit trying to undermine the law			0
@entity18 unity ? @entity75 said @entity18 need to remain unified on @entity230 and other issues , to run as a national party as much as possible even though the november elections are at the state and district level			0
" when @entity230 was brought up in the @entity20 , they all stood up and applauded , even @entity18 senators who could be in trouble on the issue in their re-election races , " she said			1
" if there are any cracks in that united front for the democrats as champions of middle class and working folks , it undermines not only their 2014 chances , but the remainder of the @entity12 presidential agenda			0
" while unity may exist in policy , some @entity18 candidates facing tough elections do n't want to campaign with @entity12 due to public opposition to @entity230 and slower - than - desired economic growth and job creation			1
on thursday , @entity264 gov. @entity264 welcomed @entity12 to his state with an airport handshake , but @entity264 's @entity18 challenger , @entity267 , was nowhere to be seen			1
@entity71 believe they can win control of the @entity15 by taking six seats from @entity18 in november			2
the @entity16 is likely to remain in @entity71 hands , with the outcomes of 90 % of the races considered safely predictable and @entity18 needing to win most of the others to regain the majority , according to @entity30			2
" it 's an uphill battle for @entity18 to retake the @entity16 , " he said , calling the situation " pretty much a matter of arithmetic			0
