-- @entity1 only this week acknowledged the storm it raised earlier this month when it made it much harder for consumers to buy books by @entity6 , a major @entity7 publisher , in order to extract better contract terms			1
the spat has affected titles by authors ranging from @entity13 to @entity14 to @entity15 , whose books @entity1 has suddenly made unavailable or more expensive , or which the online retailer says will take many weeks to ship			1
in its first public statement recognizing the dispute , @entity1 notes the standoff is unlikely to end any time soon			1
this fight is part of a long drawn - out battle between publishers and @entity1 , which has used its immense control over the book market ( by some estimates it sells up to 50 % of print and electronic books in the @entity30 ) to reshape the industry			1
understandably , authors , publishers , and others from the literary world reacted to @entity1 's latest play with alarm , cautioning that its brute exercise of power threatens not only the economic underpinnings of their industry , but also the very quality of books and diversity of ideas			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , has tried to defuse the frenzy of attention , explaining that its tactics are just a routine part of how retailers negotiate with suppliers			1
many journalists , too , have echoed @entity1 's point : sure , it might seem unfair for @entity1 to use its clout this way , but is n't it just how it goes ? and if it means @entity1 charges us less for books , are n't we better off ? they 're important questions -- ones that get to the heart of a decades - old law that , if still enforced by government , would likely go some way in taming this fight , and drastically curb @entity1 's power over the book industry in general			1
called the @entity68 of 1936 , the law prohibits a retailer from wielding its mere size to bully suppliers for discounts			2
@entity73 passed the law as the rise of @entity75 -- @entity30 's first modern mega-chain store -- was shuttering independent businesses			0
also known as the " @entity68 , " the law basically limits the clout won from size , establishing that a retailer ca n't simply secure better terms because it is bigger and therefore has more bargaining power			0
( the law also applies to suppliers , prohibiting them from discriminating against small retailers in favor of big ones			0
) preventing large chain stores from muscling exclusive discounts from suppliers based on size and not service or cost - justifications , the idea went , would give smaller entities a fair chance at competing			0
it did n't matter if retailers passed on these savings to consumers or not			0
it was fair competition that mattered			0
through the 1970s , antitrust agencies enforced the act pretty vigorously ; in the 1960s alone the government brought 518 @entity68 cases			0
enforcement began to drop under president @entity108 , and the @entity110 administration -- which ushered in a fundamental shift in antitrust policy more generally -- scaled back enforcement even further			0
successive administrations have largely followed suit : the @entity117 administration brought just one case between 1993 and 2000 , and neither the @entity119 nor the @entity120 has wielded the law since			1
federal courts , too , have made it much harder to win a price discrimination suit			1
but the law is still on the books , and is important to recall because it enshrines a key tenet : that preserving fair competition requires that we curb the bullying power of size			1
so it is true that retailers and suppliers have a right to negotiate however they please			0
but the relative bargaining power between the two parties is an important factor when considering what is anti-competitive			0
several journalists have compared @entity1 's actions to those of @entity143 , which famously uses its market dominance to squeeze suppliers -- a strategy it has applied forcibly enough to transform entire industries			1
what this analogy misses , though , is that even @entity143 's license to use its heft this way is relatively new			0
" if the government still enforced @entity68 , it would go a fair way towards limiting the power of @entity1 , " said @entity153 , ceo of the @entity154 , which represents independent bookstores			1
he would know : in the 1990s , @entity154 brought numerous cases against both publishers and chain stores for violating @entity68			0
somewhat perversely , until now , the closest encounter @entity1 has had with antitrust authorities was when it successfully prodded them to bring a case against five major publishers and @entity167			1
that fight , too , centered on the price of e-books			0
in order to wrest control back from @entity1 -- which had been pricing digital bestsellers and new titles at a flat $ 9.99 , a fraction of the price of physical copies and sometimes even lower than wholesale -- publishers had adopted a new pricing arrangement , known as the " agency model			2
" after getting @entity167 on board , publishers extended the model to all booksellers -- including @entity1			2
after losing the ability to undercut its competitors , its share of the market fell from 90 % to around 65 %			0
@entity1 responded by filing a complaint with the @entity120 , and in 2012 the @entity119 sued @entity167 and the publishers for collusion			2
as part of their settlement , publishers temporarily lost the right to the agency model , handing back to @entity1 the power to slash prices			2
in the years since , its share of the e-book market has , predictably , risen again , positioning it to leverage that market power against @entity6			2
it 's worth remembering that its tactic -- holding the publisher hostage unless it concedes to better terms -- flouts the principles of anti-price discrimination laws			0
accepting @entity1 's argument that the nature of its fight with the publisher is innate to how markets work ignores a key piece of @entity30 history			1
report : @entity1 adding music streaming to @entity218			2

@entity1 made it much harder for consumers to purchase books by publisher @entity6
@entity225 : @entity226 could play a role in bringing contract dispute to an end
books by @entity14 and @entity13 are among those affected
@entity234 : @entity226 has largely stopped enforcing a key antitrust law
