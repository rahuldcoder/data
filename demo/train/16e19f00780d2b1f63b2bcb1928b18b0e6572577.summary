-- @entity1 , a @entity2 religion scholar and author of " @entity4 : how our words unite , @entity9 , and define a @entity10 , " is a regular @entity6 contributor			2
as president @entity11 puts the finishing touches on his second inaugural address , one in which aides say @entity11 will take a " hopeful " tone , here are @entity1 's picks for the top five @entity20 presidential inaugural addresses : 1			1
@entity22 's first inaugural ( 1801 ) if you think partisan politics are bad today , you should have seen the election of 1800			1
desperately trying to hold onto power , @entity26 accused @entity22 of all sorts of infidelities to @entity30 and country , blasting him as an infidel and intimating that he might be a secret jew or @entity33			1
soon each side was questioning whether @entity20 could survive rule by the opposing party			2
the election ended in a tie between @entity22 and his running mate , @entity39			1
( at the time , the @entity40 cast its ballots without distinguishing between president and vice president , and the two @entity44 each got 73 electoral votes , throwing the decision to the @entity48			2
) it took 36 ballots before the @entity48 awarded @entity22 the presidency			1
into this maelstrom , @entity22 delivered perhaps the most conciliatory inaugural address in @entity20 history , " better liked by our own party than his own , " in the words of @entity57 @entity56			1
" let us then , fellow citizens , unite with one heart and one mind , let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty , and even life itself , are but dreary things , " he said in a classic expression of our great tradition of conciliation			2
" every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle			2
... we are all @entity44			2
" bibles , oaths and parades : inaugural trivia 2			2
@entity83 's second inaugural ( 1865 ) the @entity84 is the greatest speech by @entity20 's greatest orator , but @entity83 's second inaugural contains some of his most profound thinking			1
in this address , which according to @entity91 " sounded more like a sermon than a state paper , " @entity83 thinks out loud about the ways and means of @entity93 in the midst of the bloodletting of the @entity96			1
a lesser man might have denounced the @entity98 as evildoers , or called @entity30 to his side			2
instead @entity83 coolly observed the battleground where theology and the military meet : " both read the same @entity103 and pray to the same @entity30 , and each invokes his aid against the other			1
... the prayers of both could not be answered			0
that of neither has been answered fully			0
the @entity111 has his own purposes			0
" after this astounding flight of theological humility , @entity83 ended his remarks with another great statement of conciliation , urging his fellow @entity20 , @entity118 , to act " with malice toward none , with charity for all			1
" good advice , that , for civil wars and culture wars alike			0

@entity131 's first inaugural ( 1933 ) like @entity22 and @entity83 , @entity131 delivered his first inaugural address in a moment of crisis , though this time the crisis was economic rather than political or military			1
in an era before food stamps and @entity140 , the @entity137 had put two out of every five @entity20 out of work			1
the banking system was convulsing			0
the stock market was crashing			0
into this grim situation @entity131 delivered hope			1
" this is a national consecration , " he began , and then got right to the point : " so , first of all , let me assert my belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance			0
" strictly speaking , this sentiment makes no sense			0
fear itself aside , there is always plenty to fear			0
but @entity131 struck the right chord for the moment , and his reassuring words paved the way for the massive overhaul of the federal government now known as the @entity170			1
10 inaugural moments that mattered 4			2
@entity173 's inaugural address ( 1961 ) @entity173 's first and only inaugural was a @entity175 speech that barely mentioned domestic policy			1
it takes us back to a time when the lines between liberals and conservatives were harder to draw -- when an upstart @entity184 @entity183 like @entity173 could run to the right of the sitting @entity44 president and war hero @entity187 on foreign policy			0
it also recalls an era when presidents would actually call for sacrifice			0
today politicians tell us what our country can do for us , or they demand that our country leave us alone			0
@entity173 told us to put the interests of the nation above region , party , and even self			0
" ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country , " he said , in a line that inspired a generation to enter into the newly formed @entity209 and other forms of public service			0
in a less known but equally apropos line he said , " civility is not a sign of weakness			0
... let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us			0
@entity221 's first inaugural ( 1981 ) @entity221 's first inaugural address is n't on its own terms a classic			1
but it was historic in the sense that @entity131 's first inaugural was historic			1
while @entity131 paved the way for the @entity170 , @entity221 set the groundwork for its gradual dismantling			1
ironically , @entity131 was @entity221 's hero			1
but here @entity221 turned on the big government @entity131 had ushered in , giving the policies of his predecessor a clear rebuke			1
" in this present crisis , " he said , " government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem			0
" @entity221 's first inauguration came on the same day that 52 @entity20 hostages were released from @entity244			2
so the celebrations were particularly keen			0
but in retrospect the day was most important for ushering in the @entity247 and the fears of big government and high taxes that continue to haunt us today .			0
