@entity0 -- a custody battle involving the " best interests " of a 3 - year - old @entity5 girl was taken up by the @entity7 @entity6 on tuesday , an issue spanning the rights of adoptive parents and the desire to preserve @entity13 families within tribes			1
oral arguments played out in emotional terms , with justice @entity17 admitting " domestic relations pose the hardest problems for judges			0
... if we could appoint @entity22 , who was the first domestic relations judge , as a special master , we would do it			0
" several parties have a stake in what happens to this girl : her biological mother and father , the adoptive parents , the federal government , the @entity35 - based tribe , and a legal guardian appointed by the state to represent the child 's interests			1
the appeal was filed by @entity41 and @entity42 , who legally adopted @entity43 in 2009 , shortly after the birth mother agreed to give up the child			2
the @entity46 in july ruled for the biological father , @entity47 , who had sought custody after the child 's birth			1
he is a registered member of the @entity51 and is raising the child in @entity35			0
@entity47 had earlier signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption , but his attorneys say he did not understand the extent of the waiver , and that the birth mother misrepresented the child 's @entity61 heritage to social service workers when the adoption was finalized			2
at issue is whether @entity47 , as the onetime non-custodial father , can gain parental custody , after the @entity69 mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe			1
a special congressional law governs such interstate adoptions , since the current 556 federally recognized - tribes all fall under @entity76 oversight , giving those tribes certain unique benefits and rights			1
the @entity81 lawyers say federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a " parent			1
" while a thin majority may conclude @entity47 deserves custody , the high court was clearly torn by the conflicting applications of state and federal law			1
" if the choice is between a mother , a biological father , or a stranger , and if the father 's fit , " asked justice @entity91 , " why do you think that the federal statute requires that it be given to a stranger rather than to the biological father when the statute defines ' parent ' as the biological father ? " but chief justice @entity105 questioned the assertion @entity47 was initially enthused about becoming a father			1
" there is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy and nothing at the time of the birth , to support the child or the mother , " he said			0
" so he was excited by it ; he just did n't want to take any responsibility			0
" the federal law in question is the @entity122 of 1978 , a response to decades of often abusive social service practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of native youngsters from their families , in many cases to @entity69 homes			1
the legislation was designed to " promote the stability and security of @entity5 tribes and @entity5 families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of @entity5 children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of @entity5 families are followed in child custody proceedings			1
" @entity47 's relationship within the " federally recognized government " of the @entity51 means @entity43 is a member of the tribe and subject to its jurisdiction			2
" it 's not anyone 's intent ever to rip a child away from a loving home , " said @entity151 , the @entity152 , @entity35 - based tribe 's attorney general			2
" but we want to make sure those loving homes have the opportunity to be @entity5 homes first			1
" as with many custody fights , there is wide factual disagreement over the circumstances of both the couple 's breakup and subsequent adoption of the child			1
opposing sides even disagree on what legal issues the high court should address			1
the @entity81 think the issue should be about whether the @entity122 law can improperly block adoption proceedings voluntarily initiated by a @entity69 mother who had sole custody of her child , due to what the adoptive parents say is the @entity5 father 's failure to establish a legal parent - child relationship under state law			1
but @entity47 argues that he successfully established paternity under state law , and qualifies as a " parent " under the @entity122 , thereby giving him proper control and custody of his daughter			1
he said in legal papers that the child was conceived when the couple was engaged			2
but he claims that the biological mother , who claims @entity199 heritage , broke off the now - strained relationship by text message			2
he agreed to relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support , but said the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give the child up for adoption			2
and @entity47 claims the biological mother tried to " conceal " his @entity5 heritage during the adoption process with the @entity81 , who live in @entity212 , @entity213			1
establishing such heritage would normally make it very difficult for the @entity51 and state social services to agree to any @entity69 adoption and removal from the state			0
on the flip side , without that designation , state law would have made it hard for @entity47 to get custody			2
by this time , @entity47 went to @entity225 on a one - year deployment in the @entity227 , making it hard to press his custody claims			2
@entity43 lived with the @entity81 for two years before the high court in @entity213 ruled for the father			1
@entity47 took his daughter back to @entity232 , @entity35 , on @entity233 2011			0
the state 's top court that ruled in his favor said @entity47 had " a deeply embedded relationship " with his @entity61 heritage , in which @entity43 will be raised			2
but the @entity81 point to another part of the state court 's conclusion : that despite a ruling against them , they were " ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment			1
" that court said its hands were tied , and that federal law trumped state law			1
" our lives have been turned upside down and our home is empty with her , " @entity42 told @entity1 last month			0
" what would any parent feel like if their child had been removed out of their home abruptly and with no contact whatsoever ? it 's unbearable			0
" in arguments , attorney @entity263 representing the @entity81 , warned a ruling against her clients would discourage interracial adoption			0
" you are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they want to adopt " a native @entity7 child , she said			0
" and you 're basically relegating the child to a piece of property with a sign that says , ' @entity5 -- keep off			2
" @entity263 said the father 's initial agreement to give up his parental rights meant he forfeited any subsequent efforts to establish custody , when the child was already in a happy , stable home environment			1
but several justices questioned her assertion the law 's intent to protect against the " breakup of the @entity5 family " did not apply to a man whose only initial relationship to the girl was one of biology			1
" it seems to me he 's the father , the other woman 's the mother , that 's the @entity5 family " protected under the federal law , said justice @entity297			1
" the father , the mother , and the kid			0
" @entity47 's attorney @entity307 later said state courts made a thorough best interest determination			0
yet some on the bench noted the girl and her biological father were listed in legal documents as being less than 1 percent @entity5			1
" is it one drop of [ @entity5 ] blood that triggers all these extraordinary rights ? " asked @entity105			1
the @entity320 administration is supporting the birth father and the continued use of the @entity122 law			2
as a single mother with two other young children , the biological mother felt she had no choice but to give her daughter up for adoption , said a legal brief filed by her lawyers			2
they say she complied with the adoption laws in both states and with the tribe			0
the couple also says they long wanted to be parents and had seven unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilization			0
she is a child developmental psychologist and he is an automotive body technician			0
they were in the room when @entity43 was born , and had an " open " adoption , meaning the biological mother could and did maintain a relationship with @entity43			0
both the @entity81 and @entity47 attend the court arguments tuesday but did not acknowledge the other			0
@entity47 told @entity1 afterward he was looking forward to getting back home to @entity35 to see his daughter			0
" she 's asking for me to be there , " he said			0
now married to another woman since june , the father says @entity43 is in a happy , stable environment in @entity35			0
his attorney @entity357 said @entity47 " has done as much as humanely possible to get his daughter and keep her			0
he wants to raise that child			0
" the case is @entity360 , a @entity361 ( 12 - 399 )			0
a decision is expected in june .			0

@entity5 man won custody of his biological daughter
@entity213 couple 's appeal being heard by high court
a federal law meant to protect @entity5 family breakup is *key* to the case
sides disagree over biological father 's rights
