@entity0 -- the @entity5 military has been pounded by coalition airstrikes neutralizing its air capabilities but it is still able to fight and maneuver on the ground , @entity3 officials said			1
the @entity9 has been grounded after five days of operations by the coalition forces			2
more than 160 @entity13 missiles and several hundred strikes from fighter jets have virtually destroyed @entity17 's air defense			1
the toll on the air system is " to the point where we can operate with near impunity across @entity5 , " said @entity24 @entity23 of @entity26 's @entity25			0
despite the targeting of mobile launchers , @entity5 forces still have numerous mobile launchers that could pose a risk to coalition planes			2
but it 's the ground forces where @entity17 has more maneuverability because of the coalition 's limitations in fighting @entity5 forces only from the air			1
@entity17 's forces have retreated from the eastern city of @entity40 , but continue to fight in other cities including @entity42 and @entity43 using " tanks , artillery , rocket launchers , " according to rear adm. @entity44 , chief of staff for the coalition @entity46			1
the coalition is able to strike at forces moving toward cities , but once they are inside city limits , dropping bombs with enough precision to avoid civilian casualties is difficult			1
before the war , @entity5 had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery			0
@entity17 had close to 2,000 tanks and armored vehicles to move around , but much was poorly maintained			2
@entity5 's elite forces come from tribes loyal to @entity17 , dedicated to protecting the regime			1
the @entity66 , for instance , is commanded by one of @entity17 's sons			1
those forces total , at most , 10,000 men			0
they are better paid and better equipped , said @entity72 , a military analyst at @entity73 , with tanks and conventional weapons			0
those elite forces are on the offense			0
@entity3 surveillance planes have seen some attacks by the elite units			0
" those forces are fully engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , " @entity44 said			0
the @entity17 forces remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , a @entity3 official told @entity1			1
they are relatively well organized and continue to fight effectively in certain parts of the country , said the unnamed official , who is not authorized to speak on the record			0
the rebels have gained some additional battle space due to coalition efforts , the official said			0
rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , but the @entity17 forces have the upper edge at this point in time , the official said			2
however , where possible , the coalition is hitting the forces on the ground , arguing it is within the mission of protecting civilians			2
" @entity17 's forces are feeling the strain of several weeks of fighting without any resupply , " the official said			1
" in @entity115 to @entity42 , our targeted priorities are mechanized forces , those mobile integrated -- those mobile surface - to - air missile sites , interdicting their lines of communications which supply their beans and their bullets , their command - and - control , and any opportunities for sustainment of that activity , " @entity44 said wednesday .			0

@entity17 's elite ground forces are well - paid , well - equipped
those troops fight within cities , where coalition ca *n't* easily get them
