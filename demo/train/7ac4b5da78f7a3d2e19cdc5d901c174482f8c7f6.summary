-- until very recently , nouveau riche @entity2 would not have been caught dead buying someone else 's cast - offs -- even if they were @entity6			1
but as the @entity2 market , which many luxury goods companies have come to rely on for growth in recent years , matures , a new brand of luxury shopper is emerging in @entity2 : the kind that loves a bargain more than a logo			1
shops selling , renting and repairing second - hand luxury goods are springing up across @entity2 , along with branches of high - end consignment shops from @entity19 and @entity20 that buy and sell second - hand goods , paying the seller a commission			1
@entity24 was one of the first pre-owned luxury stores in @entity27 when it opened eight years ago			1
but its owner @entity29 says she only recently started putting her logo on the store 's shopping bags because consumers used to be ashamed to be caught buying used goods			1
there are now signs that the stigma is melting away			0
since 2009 , @entity24 has posted double - digit annual sales growth , and the shop has hundreds of bags for sale , many on consignment from individuals			2
ms @entity29 has opened six shops in @entity27 and plans to expand to other provinces			0
@entity46 , a regular customer of @entity24 , likes the fact she can purchase unused bags at the shop for 20 - 30 per cent less than retail			2
" i do n't mind people knowing that i carry second - hand bags , " ms @entity46 says			2
" i think it is worth it to buy at those prices "			0
the second - hand shops should not be confused with the kind of high street thrift shops found in @entity60 or @entity61			1
@entity62 , a second - hand shop in @entity27 's chic @entity65 concession , has shelves packed with new or barely used @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity6 bags			2
they range in price from @entity72 , 000 ( $ 320 ) for the cheapest @entity67 to @entity73 , 000 for a crocodile @entity74 from @entity6			0
just down the road at ms @entity29 's @entity24 -- housed in a @entity79 - style villa with a sun - filled garden -- the @entity76 is still top of the price chain at @entity83 , 000			2
at one branch of @entity19 second - hand chain brand off in @entity27 's @entity65 concession , a @entity74 with a child 's drawing in black marker filling one entire side was priced at @entity91 , 000			1
ms @entity29 and her competitors say the people selling them handbags are not in it for the money , unlike in the west where consumers liquidate luxury items in times of economic distress			0
even now , when economic growth on the mainland has slowed to 7.4 per cent , no one is emptying their closets of @entity67 to feed the children			0
@entity107 , manager of @entity108 , says the popularity of luxury thrift stores has more to do with growing sophistication than with desperation			0
as @entity2 consumers who once thought they were too rich to buy used goods travel more , they become familiar with foreign concepts such as second - hand shops			1
the rise of the second - hand stores also reflects a profound shift in the taste of mainland luxury consumers			1
ms @entity107 says shoppers from less developed fashion markets outside @entity27 still come to her shop looking for logo - heavy products such as @entity67 or @entity68			1
but @entity27 shoppers " prefer to be more low profile , " she says , noting that their favourite brands are @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity6			0
the buyers are getting younger too : many are students , white collar workers at the start of their careers , or even younger , says ms @entity29			0
