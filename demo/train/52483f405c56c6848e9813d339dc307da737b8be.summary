-- wine - making in @entity2 has been an integral part of the country 's culture for millennia ; so ingrained is viticulture in the country that imagery of grapevines can be seen adorning churches and public monuments			1
but a @entity14 embargo on @entity2 wine imports imposed in 2006 has meant its vineyards have been transformed more in the last six years than the previous 8,000			1
until the embargo , the country of 4.5 million people in the @entity19 sold around 50 % of its wine to @entity14			2
a year after it was cut off from its biggest market , sales dropped by a further 25 % , according to the @entity25			0
safety concerns were the official reason behind the @entity14 ban on all beverages imported from @entity2 , although many within the wine industry believe the move was politically motivated			1
" in 2004 the wine industry started its reforms and by 2006 ( counterfeiting and sub-standard quality wine ) was partly solved , " says @entity33 , of @entity34 , an independent winery in @entity2			1
while little known to most wine drinkers in western countries , @entity2 has traditionally had a reputation for producing the best quality wine from the region , especially among former @entity46 states			1
with over 500 endemic varieties of grapes it is one of the world 's most diverse for types of wine , with most families owning small vineyards using traditional wine - making methods -- typically in huge , underground amphorae - like vessels called " qveri "			1
yet its good reputation was diluted by counterfeiting that increased during the late 1990s and early part of the last decade			0
one of the most common ways to produce fakes was to pass off substandard wine , sometimes not made in @entity2 at all , as a better quality product			2
" in the bottle its grape juice or wine from elsewhere but it bared the label of @entity2 appellation , " says @entity66 of the @entity67			2
" the other type of counterfeit is n't wine in the bottle at all , but something else like juice of radish or carrots with alcohol			0
" @entity66 says that is was easy to spot the fakes even before drinking them because they were sold a much cheaper price than the authentic wines			0
despite @entity66 's contention that the counterfeiting was limited , fakes would turn up in other markets apart from @entity14 even as far as the @entity93 @entity92 of @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 have been a substantial export market for @entity2 wine and some estimates have suggested that before 2006 there was twice as much fake @entity2 wine as authentic sold there			1
" @entity2 's wine players all suffered because of the name infringement and it hit the reputation of @entity2 wine overall , " says @entity102			1
the result of the embargo and loss of the biggest export market was that many wine - makers simply had to close while those that survived had to upgrade their facilities and quality			1
many , like @entity34 , have recast themselves as boutique vineyards with an eye to tapping into the western market			0
previously known as @entity118 and founded in 2002 by a small group of @entity2 winemakers near the eastern city of @entity122 , it was bought by @entity124 investor and wine aficionado @entity126 in 2008			2
the aim was to provide a higher quality wine that would impress @entity130 wine drinkers			0
" @entity137 consumers have better expectations rather than those who have an established history of drinking @entity2 wines , " says @entity33 , who also says that the 300,000 bottles that @entity132 produces each year could be expanded to one million as @entity134 's thirst for wine increases each year			2
while sales of @entity2 wine have been increasing for the last three years , it could still take another five years for the volume of sales to surpass pre- 2006 levels , according to @entity148			1
with only 45,000 hectares of vineyards ( one of the world 's largest wine producers , @entity153 , has over one million hectares ) , @entity2 wine will always be a relatively bespoke operation			1
" but if we get back the same volume ( as 2006 ) the value will also go up , " says @entity102			0
since 2004 the @entity2 government has taken steps to protect and encourage the industry , legally reclaiming @entity2 names from companies registered in @entity163 and the @entity93 , and in april an agreement with the @entity165 came into effect on mutual protection of trademarked food and drink			2
" wine is very important for the country , " says @entity102			0
" it 's one of the high quality products of the country			0
the key instrument to raise awareness , plus the uniqueness gives us the opportunity to attract international attention			0
" @entity0 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports .			0

@entity2 is thought to be the world 's oldest wine producing area
history of wine - making stretches goes back over 8,000 years
@entity14 embargo on @entity2 wine since 2006 *initially* hit industry hard
many producers have improved quality and looked for new markets
