editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive of @entity3 , a global management consulting firm , and the author of " @entity6 : a short guide to leading a @entity8 "			1
he writes a weekly column , how we work , for @entity12			1
@entity2 says good times persuaded people to sacrifice what they loved for money			1
@entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- i started my consulting business 11 years ago with a laptop computer in a living room			1
the first year i made more money than i had in the previous three combined , the second year i doubled that and by the third year i began to fantasize about retiring within the decade			1
then everything crashed ; the dotcom revolution , the financial services industry and my business			1
i had a large number of subcontractors and a small number of employees who had become friends			2
i also had a bad feeling things would n't turn around quickly			1
my wife and i were in a tough spot			2
we had one child and another on the way , bills that were accumulating and hopes for the future that were moving out of reach			2
however bad it was then , these days it 's worse			2
back then the recession hit certain sectors and left other ones alone			2
home prices were going up , so people felt protected , and there were loans to help			1
today , everything 's been hit , nothing 's going up and credit is frozen			2
many have already lost jobs , homes , self - identities , luxuries and necessities			2
and there 's more to come			2
that 's especially true for many older @entity66 , who might not have 10 years to recover and who do n't have sources of income other than their savings -- which have dwindled dramatically			1
they do n't deserve to live with the fear they now feel			1
i 'm still living in a rental apartment because i did n't want to take out a loan i could n't pay back			1
and now my investments are down 70 percent			2
but it is what it is			2
and when we wake up in the morning we are left with the question , " now what ? " it 's actually a great question , because in a situation in which we 've lost control , it gives us a little back			2
" now what ? " means we have a choice , in this moment , to do something			0
what 's it going to be ? i think it 's a mistake to try to rebuild what we 've lost			0
we have less now and i think we can do better with less			0
and consciously making those choices can bring us closer to the things we care about			0
which can make a poorer life richer than a rich one			0
because the research is clear			0
above a basic threshold , more money does n't make us happier			1
but we think it will , so we do all sorts of things that make us unhappy in order to get it			0
a senior leader in an investment bank called to tell me she was leaving her job			0
she realized she would n't make much money in the next few years and did n't want to miss her children growing up			1
did you get that ? she was willing to miss her children growing up if the money was good enough			1
people act in ways they 'd rather not in order to make money that does n't make them happy			1
maybe , if we do this downturn right , we can get out of that cycle			0
so , what makes you happy ? is it spending time with people you love ? working on a pet project ? having the time to exercise ? being part of a community and feeling cared for ? knowing the answer enables you to make decisions that will prioritize those things			1
of course , losing money can break people apart ; we fight about money , people lose jobs and get depressed ; tension rises as mortgage bills sit on the kitchen table unpaid ; resentment builds when one person does n't live up to his own and others ' expectations			1
but i am also seeing the opposite			0
losing money can bring you closer to your values ; can actually bring people together			1
it 's hard to appreciate in the midst of our loss , but embracing the forced reduction in lifestyle can be positive			1
i know of a couple whose marriage was saved when they moved from a bigger house into a smaller one and actually began talking to each other again			0
last weekend , two people had a beautiful wedding in @entity171 surrounded by family and friends , months before they had planned , avoiding thousands of dollars of expenses and all the tension that goes with it			1
why ? because she lost her job and needed to get onto his health insurance			0
friends of mine held their daughter 's bat mitzvah at another friend 's house , avoiding tremendous expense while creating the warmest community celebration , filled with gratitude and tears , that i have ever seen			0
in 2003 , after my business crashed , my wife and i decided to move to @entity194 , @entity195 , where she grew up and life was much cheaper			0
had my business continued to grow we could never have afforded to make that choice			0
when the business crashed , we could n't afford not to			1
while there , we spent priceless time with her family , had another child , made lifelong friends and rebuilt my business -- this time very differently			0
i love consulting and writing and speaking , but the bigger the business became , the less i did those things and the more i managed others doing it			0
eventually we returned to @entity17			0
now i 'm back to a laptop in a living room and i love it again			0
it 's smaller , more sustainable and a lot more fun			0
and i have the time to spend with my family and friends			0
my fantasy is no longer to retire ; it 's to keep doing what i 'm doing for as long as i can			0
life is not a linear path of increasing wealth , accumulation and achievement			0
do n't let the money crisis draw you apart from people you love and things you love to do			1
use it to draw you closer			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : in the boom , people sacrificed their joys for more money
he says beyond a certain point , money does n't increase happiness
@entity2 : use hard times to evaluate what makes you happy and *pursue* it
