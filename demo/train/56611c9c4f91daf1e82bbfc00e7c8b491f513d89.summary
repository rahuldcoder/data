-- @entity1 put his motorcycle in storage in @entity4 , @entity5 , to protect it from @entity6 as the category 4 hurricane headed toward the @entity5 coast			1
he fought crowds at the grocery store to stock up on supplies and tried to soothe anxieties among students in his sixth - grade class			1
about 175 miles away , in @entity17 , @entity5 , @entity16 was bracing thursday for her first hurricane			1
" the locals have been really nice , telling me what i needed to buy to get ready , " the recent college graduate said			1
@entity1 and @entity16 are two of millions of people watching and waiting as @entity6 looms offshore , moving closer and closer to land			1
" we were a little nervous yesterday because we were unsure of the track of the storm , " but now it looks like it 's going to miss his area , said @entity1 , who teaches social studies and science at @entity25			1
several of his students live in @entity33 , just south of the zone covered by a hurricane warning			1
one student 's mother bought a lot of water , and another , whose father is in the military , brought home dozens of @entity43 -- meals ready to eat -- that are normally issued to troops in the field			1
@entity1 said he 's also seen a rush at several local stores , including supermarkets , as well as home improvement and hardware stores , as people try to get ready for whatever @entity6 brings			1
some of his students talked about their fears of the impending hurricane , sparked by footage they 'd seen of the aftermath of @entity59 , @entity1 said			1
they were nervous that something similar could happen in their neighborhoods , he explained			1
but now that it looks like the worst of the storm might miss them , they 're disappointed that they wo n't have a day off from school tomorrow , he joked			1
@entity16 said this is her first hurricane			2
" i 'm looking forward to it , " she said , although she admitted she does n't really know what to expect			2
the @entity74 native , who works for a vacation rental company in @entity17 , said she saw tornadoes in her home state and later experienced earthquakes when she moved to @entity79			1
now , fresh out of college and newly established in @entity17 , she 's enjoying the scene			1
" we had a beautiful sunrise -- i 'm making a video of that now -- and it 's just starting to get cloudy			2
" @entity16 , who contributed video of waves and surf churned up by @entity6 to @entity0 's @entity89 , says she hopes she does n't have to stay inside too much			2
" there are some guys who do hurricane preparations and i 'm going to go out with them for a while and shoot some more video , " she said			2
are people still out ? " yes , they are			1
i saw some people out surfing this morning , but the rip tides are really getting strong so i do n't think they 'll be able to stay in much longer			1
i saw this one guy who went into the surf and just a couple of minutes later he was a quarter mile down the beach			2
" many vacationers along the @entity5 coast started to head home wednesday , especially after a few counties issued evacuation orders for visitors			1
but that 's not stopping @entity111 , who lives in @entity112 , @entity113 , from making a planned trip to visit friends in @entity5			1
" where we were going is actually a beach condo they own " in @entity112 , @entity5 , said @entity111 , 38			1
" but they live in @entity120 , which is kind of northwest of @entity112 , so we 're going to stay there instead			2
that 's if there 's power and things like that			2
i 'm hoping it 's not too bad			2
" @entity111 , an engineer for @entity127 , said he was " kind of bummed out " when he first thought that @entity6 might affect his vacation plans			1
" but then i found out that it was n't going to be an exact hit , so we thought maybe we 'll still try to make it , which we are going to go for , " he told @entity0			2
he previously lived in @entity133 , @entity113 , for seven years , so he 's experienced hurricanes before			2
" i 've lived through a few , " @entity111 said			2
he said usually he drove north to get away from the storms , but on one occasion , about five years ago , he decided to ride out the hurricane			2
" the wind was incredible			0
i could n't believe it			0
" " i remember thinking , i wish i would have left , " he added			0
" it 's a scary thing			0
" @entity142 of @entity143 , @entity5 , said all he saw at one point thursday were " sprinkles , " a dark gray sky , and tides perking up -- but not lightning and thunder			1
" i hate to say it , " said @entity142 , " but we are used to this			0
" he lives right on the ocean and is expecting no more than wind , rain , and possible power outages			0
" i guess you can say we 're idiots , " he said " we 've got our mobile home tied down and we 're good to go			0
" @entity142 said only a couple of stores have closed , but no one is boarding up windows or taking extreme precautions			1
@entity142 's mother is ill so there is no way they could evacuate if they wanted to , but he states , " even if we could leave , we would n't			0
" " my biggest concern , " said @entity142 , " is if the refrigerator is going to be running tomorrow			0
" @entity171 's @entity89 from the coast @entity173 and his family have decided to ride out @entity6 as they are visiting @entity176 , @entity177			1
he thinks the storm will be a " glancing blow , " but his wife disagrees			0
" the first thing she said to me this morning was ' we should evacuate , ' " said @entity173 , " and i usually listen to her , but this time i 'm pretty confident we 'll be ok			0
" originally from @entity186 , @entity177 , @entity173 said he experienced what he thinks will turn out to be a worse storm , @entity189 in 2003			1
@entity190 -- president of @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity177 , -- also remembers the " really bad " @entity189 , and said some people are really preparing for this hurricane and others are n't			1
" i 'm personally concerned that if the storm does n't turn , we 'll have a big surprise , " @entity190 said			0
many of his customers are moving boats off the water where the surge is mounting up , and they are trying to create more room for boats that are evacuating the churning sea			0
" we 're sending trucks to @entity207 to pick up additional stands , " said @entity190			0
" and until we run out of real estate , we 'll keep hauling			0
" farther north in @entity212 , @entity213 , 42 - year - old @entity214 owns the @entity215 -- right on the boardwalk by the ocean			0
she said the town has already started to prepare by erecting a storm fence in hopes of keeping sand from going onto the boardwalk			0
she 's taking awnings and other things down -- tasks she usually performs in the winter			0
" we 've already got 8 - to 10 - foot waves			0
it 's a little windy , but not that much yet , " she said			0
" i do n't think it 's going to get that bad			0
from what i 'm watching right now , we 're going to get 40 miles an hour winds			0
... hopefully , unless it turns , it 's going to miss us			0
" the big negative is that this big holiday beach weekend could turn into a dud for some shore businesses			0
but , @entity214 said , " this weekend might be a wash			0
" while the storm will keep many away , it might attract others			0
" i 'll get people who 'll want to sit in the restaurant and watch the storm , " she said			1
