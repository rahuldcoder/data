@entity0 -- after digging their heels into a legal battle , two high - end @entity3 shoe designers can now lay claim to iconic red - soled shoes			1
a federal appeals court has ruled that shoe designer @entity9 can enforce a @entity11 trademark of the red - lacquered sole that adorns the designer 's footwear when it contrasts with the color of the rest of the shoe			1
the court also said wednesday that the trademark does not apply when the shoe is monochromatic , such as @entity21 's designs that were entirely red			2
a lawsuit filed in june 2011 by @entity9 took issue with four specific shoes from @entity21 's @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity29 models , saying they violated @entity9 's trademarked " lacquered red sole			1
" @entity9 appealed after a federal court judge denied an injunction in august of last year that would have kept @entity21 from selling shoes with red soles			2
in his decision last year , judge @entity36 said that " @entity9 's claim to the ' the color red ' is , without some limitation , overly broad and inconsistent with the scene of trademark registration			2
" in the appellate decision , circuit judge @entity43 upheld trademark protection of @entity9 's red - lacquered outsole but said that @entity21 's use of the red sole in its monochromatic shoe does not infringe on the trademark			1
according to the decision , @entity9 introduced his signature red sole in 1992 and registered the red - lacquered outsole as a trademark in 2008			1
in a news release , @entity21 says that its shoe collections have included styles with red ( and other colored ) outsoles since the 1970s			0
both sides appeared to be satisfied with the appellate court decision			0
@entity63 , the attorney for @entity9 , said his client is " very , very pleased " with the decision , adding that nontraditional trademarks such as colors have to be developed over time			0
" color does n't start as something unique , it becomes unique , " he said			0
" more and more i think you 'll see this coming because of the need to differentiate your product from others on the shelf , " he said			0
" it will have influence on a far broader sense than just the fashion industry			0
" @entity80 , legal counsel to @entity21 , said in a wednesday statement , " we are happy to have achieved a victory in defending against @entity9 's lawsuit			2
" @entity80 reemphasized that @entity21 had not infringed on @entity9 's trademark and " will continue to produce monochromatic shoes with red outsoles			1
" @entity9 's science behind the perfect high heel @entity1 's @entity90 contributed to this report .			0

an appeals court says @entity9 can enforce its red - lacquered sole trademark
but the trademark applies only if the sole color contrasts with the color of the rest of the shoe
the trademark does not apply to monochromatic shoes , such as designs by @entity21
a lawsuit that @entity9 filed in june 2011 took issue with four specific @entity21 shoes
