-- it all seemed in place for @entity3 in saturday 's @entity5 final			1
she was the people 's favorite , surged to semifinals at the @entity10 and @entity9 , and @entity11 's princess @entity3 -- who the tennis player was named after -- looked on from the @entity13			2
ten years ago , @entity3 's idol , @entity14 , won @entity5 as the 13th seed			1
@entity3 , who shares the @entity17 's enormous appetite for titles and competitiveness , happened to be seeded 13th this fortnight			2
but @entity3 's coronation will have to wait , since none of the above mattered to @entity23			1
@entity24 , too , will have to wait for a maiden grand slam singles champion			1
@entity23 became the @entity27 once again when the powerful , left - handed @entity28 crushed @entity3 6 - 3 6 - 0 in a mere 55 minutes for a second crown at tennis ' most prestigious tournament , claiming the $ 3 million first prize			1
it was the most lopsided @entity5 women 's final since @entity41 routed @entity42 6 - 2 6 - 1 in 1992 , not what anyone expected given @entity3 's battling qualities -- and the fact she had n't dropped a set before the final			1
" i thought @entity3 was going to win , " @entity11 's @entity45 finalist @entity44 , a longtime tennis analyst at @entity5 , told @entity0			1
" i was thinking that @entity3 , who is just an animal -- and i mean that in a form of flattery , sort of in your face , confident , poised -- would get enough balls back and rush @entity52			0
" @entity52 was just seeing the ball like a football			0
" closing the roof for the trophy presentation with rain on the way took almost as long as the second set			0
no matter what happens in the months leading into @entity5 , former world no. 2 @entity23 -- who will rise to fourth in the new rankings -- appears to instantly feel at home at the @entity65			1
whereas she has n't reached a grand slam quarterfinal outside @entity5 since the @entity68 , she 's progressed to at least the last eight at tennis ' most famous postcode of @entity73 five straight times			1
her flat , booming ground strokes thrive on the grass , and the lower bounces are to her liking			0
with rallies generally shorter , she does n't have to hit as many balls -- so can limit her unforced errors			1
@entity3 , at 20 the youngest female grand slam finalist in five years , simply did n't face anyone of @entity23 's caliber this tournament			1
nerves were n't a factor , as they were for @entity87 in last year 's final against @entity89			0
" she has weapons , " @entity3 , who took home $ 1.5 million for her efforts , told reporters			0
" we know that when she 's on , she 's very tough to beat , especially on this surface			0
" an aggressive player , even @entity3 took a backseat in that department to @entity23 , but that was little surprise since the latter always does the dictating			2
@entity23 's focus , crucially , never wavered			2
she finished with glittering statistics of 28 winners and only 12 unforced errors			1
@entity3 's figures were n't bad , though : eight winners and four unforced errors			1
@entity23 won 82 % of her first - serve points and broke six times			2
" there might have been some players who could have been able to keep her off balance a bit with a bigger serve , like a @entity115 ( @entity116 ) , but i would have to say her display was one of the best i 've ever seen from a woman at @entity5 in terms of ball striking , " said @entity44			0
not known for her scampering , @entity23 for good measure won the point of the final when she retrieved like @entity126 and struck a slice - backhand passing - shot winner to hold for 3 - 1 in the first set			2
" really for the first time i said , ' oh , my @entity134 , this is good , ' " @entity23 , who cried as she addressed the crowd , told reporters			0
" i can really run and put everything back			0
i was 100 % ready for everything			0
" her running forehand cross-court pass deep in the second was almost as good , and @entity23 ended matters with a sizzling cross-court backhand winner prior to raising her arms and falling to the grass			2
on this form , it wo n't be the last time @entity23 celebrates on @entity147			0
one of her tasks now is to land a grand slam title outside @entity150			1
" i hope it 's now going to be easier for me , " @entity23 said			2
once she broke for 2 - 1 in the first set , the 24 - year - old was never threatened			0
@entity3 saved three break points to hold for 2 - 3 -- but it was her last hold			1
the second set took 23 minutes , with @entity3 claiming 10 points total			2
at least @entity3 -- who will become the highest - ranked @entity24 woman in tennis history at no. 7 when the new list is released on monday -- can say the fans were heavily behind her			1
" even on court today i felt some special support from the crowd , " she said			0
" it 's humbling to receive all this support			0
it 's special to hear that people want me to do well and believe in me			0
" in sunday 's men 's final , @entity170 tries for an eighth @entity5 title against top seed @entity174			1
but the duo will have a difficult job of matching @entity23 's impeccable outing			0
