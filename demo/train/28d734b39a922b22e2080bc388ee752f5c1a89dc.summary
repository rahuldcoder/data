-- as @entity3 flew into @entity4 on saturday , the @entity2 's 291 passengers did n't know that the man at the controls had never landed this kind of plane at this airport before			1
could that have contributed to the crash , which resulted in the deaths of two teenage passengers ? no one knows for sure , including federal investigators who have n't ruled out pilot error in their investigation			1
the plane crashed while trying to land on a runway that starts at the edge of @entity21			1
it lumbered in too low and too slow , investigators say , and then tried to increase speed to go around for another landing			2
instead , the plane hit the runway , cracked in two , spun out of control and caught fire			2
does it matter that the pilot at the time -- aviation veteran @entity33 - kuk -- has only 43 hours of flying time in the 777 ? @entity35 's @entity34 says @entity33 has flown the model nine times			1
@entity34 flight attendants hailed as heroes it 's " highly significant , " former @entity42 inspector general @entity41 said monday , particularly how he came across the water and over the seawall , she said			1
if the pilot was going to avert danger , @entity41 said , he needed to take action well before the plane reached that seawall			1
@entity33 knew how to fly			2
an experienced pilot for @entity34 , @entity33 had more than 10,000 hours in other kinds of aircraft , the airline says , although it 's still unknown which types			1
@entity33 was legally qualified to fly the plane , @entity41 said			1
but he was also flying during a period when he was trying to build up additional hours of 777 cockpit time to " gain comfort at the controls and experience flying the plane under certain conditions			1
" this new wrinkle in the mystery surrounding the crash raises questions about how pilots are trained to fly new aircraft			1
training varies from country to country			0
in the @entity75 , the @entity74 requires even the most experienced pilots to undergo rigorous training to learn how to fly different types of planes			0
the new development calls into question the protocol of the cockpit and whether the flight crew is encouraged to question a pilot 's decisions			1
is @entity33 a greenhorn when it comes to flying the 777 ? shock and survival : crash through the eyes of children pilots will tell you that 43 hours of real - world experience flying a new type of aircraft is not a lot			1
someone with that amount of time is still " new to the airplane , " said @entity104 , an aviation consultant and 20 - year airline pilot			1
the widely accepted threshold for an experienced pilot in any aircraft is generally about 100 hours			0
pilots generally learn how to fly new aircraft by undergoing many weeks of training at ground school classes and on plane simulators and , finally , by being shadowed by a " check airman			2
" the check airman determines whether the trainee passes or will go back for more training			0
among the four pilots aboard @entity3 was a " check pilot , " @entity75 investigators said , who was monitoring @entity33			1
@entity104 flew 777s hundreds of times			0
before that , he captained 727s , 737s and @entity127			0
he knows what it 's like to be a veteran pilot who is learning how to fly a new kind of airliner			1
" typically in your career , you 're going to be changing airplanes all the time , " he said			0
" this is a typical and normal transition			0
" the 777 is a pilot 's aircraft , @entity104 said			1
it 's relatively easy to fly , especially if you 're experienced with other airliners			1
does @entity2 experience matter when it comes to flying a different model ? it does n't make it easier or harder , according to @entity104 , but prior routines may influence piloting decisions			0
the @entity34 pilot " may have been thinking , ' the last airplane i flew , i know i could get it down from here			0
' " perhaps the 777 " had characteristics different from the plane he flew before , " @entity104 said			2
" those are things the ( @entity156 ) will look at			0
" did @entity34 passengers ignore safety messages ? in addition to the 777 , @entity104 knows @entity21 's airport , having landed at the crash site -- runway 28 left -- hundreds of times during his long airline career			1
for @entity104 and other pilots familiar with that runway , the bottom line is : there 's nothing problematic about it			0
" sometimes , the wind might be a little tricky , " @entity104 said , but that 's about it			0
it 's routine for pilots with fewer than 100 hours of flight time on an aircraft to land at @entity176 , @entity104 said			0
a pilot 's general target zone is within the first third of the runway			2
@entity33 had flown into the airport before , according to @entity34 , but this was his first time landing a 777 at @entity4			2
airline pilots who 've been following the story also want to know what happened in the cockpit			0
did anyone other than the pilot notice that the plane was coming in too low and slow ? did they alert the pilot that he needed to take action ? if not , why ? interactive : what happened with @entity3 ? this is all about the culture of the cockpit , pilots say			1
airlines the @entity75 and around the world have embraced the idea that officers should feel free to challenge authority if they have concerns			0
decades ago , the captain 's word was unquestionable , making the commander essentially @entity208 of the @entity209			0
how much -- if any -- of that culture existed in the cockpit of flight 214 ? @entity156 chairwoman @entity213 said it 's important for the two pilots in charge of an aircraft during the " very risky " landing phase to work closely together			0
investigators have no evidence of cockpit communications problems , she said , but it 's something they will be looking at			2
@entity213 also downplayed the significance of the pilot 's experience , saying it 's typical for pilots to change aircraft types			2
more answers may come from crew accounts			0
@entity213 indicated monday that her team had not completed interviews with the flight 's pilots and were waiting for @entity35 investigators and interpreters			2
those pilot interviews will probably form a large part of the evidence investigators use to determine what really happened in those crucial seconds before the tragic crash landing of flight 214			1
how does an air crash investigation work ?			0

veteran at controls of @entity3 had flown that type of plane only nine times before , airline says
777 veteran pilot says learning how to fly different airliners is not a big deal
@entity256 official : it 's " highly significant " that pilot had never flown 777 into @entity21
federal crash investigators have n't ruled out anything , including pilot error
