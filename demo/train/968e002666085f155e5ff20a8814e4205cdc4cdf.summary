-- after his infamous " brain freeze " that drew laughter and ridicule from his detractors , @entity2 gov. @entity1 poked fun at himself thursday night while delivering the " @entity12 " list on @entity11 ' " the @entity9 with @entity10			1
" @entity1 sauntered on stage smiling , clapped his hands and saluted the crowd before rattling off the " @entity12 @entity16			1
" among them : no. 6 : " you try concentrating with @entity19 smiling at you			0
that is one handsome dude ! " no. 5 : " uh , @entity22 ? " no. 4 : " i had a 5 - hour energy drink six hours before the debate			2
" no. 2 : " i wanted to help take the heat off my buddy @entity27			2

" @entity1 made sure he was in control of the jokes after wednesday 's @entity32 debate in @entity33 , @entity34 , when he said he would eliminate three federal agencies if elected president -- but could name only two of them			1
that produced a painful period of more than 50 seconds during which @entity1 tried in vain to remember the third federal agency			1
it ended only after @entity1 conceded that he could not remember it -- even after appearing to consult his notes			1
" oops , " he said			0
@entity1 has a chance to redeem himself on the debate front saturday , when he is scheduled face off with other @entity32 presidential hopefuls at the @entity52 - @entity51 debate in @entity53			1
the morning after the debacle , @entity1 said his " brain freeze " showed he is not " the slickest politician " among the field of @entity32 presidential hopefuls			1
his campaign , meanwhile , sought to raise funds off the gaffe , encouraging supporters to send $ 5 for every government agency they " would like to forget			0
" operatives from the left and the right slammed the moment as a potential sign of @entity1 's campaign imploding			1
the @entity70 quoted @entity71 , an aide to former president @entity72 , as calling the moment the " human equivalent of shuttle challenger			0
" speaking to @entity0 's @entity76 on thursday , @entity1 said , " we need substance more than we need style " and tried to turn the incident into an attack on president @entity79			1
when @entity83 said that the president has to be " debater in chief , " @entity1 responded , " we 've got a debater in chief right now			1
and you 've got to ask yourself : how 's that working out for @entity91 ? " his campaign sent out a note to supporters saying , " we 've all had human moments			2
" the note from " @entity97 " points out that @entity79 , at a campaign stop during the 2008 election , referred to having visited " 57 states			1
" " @entity101 got lost somewhere on the @entity102 in an answer to a debate question , " the note adds			1
" @entity105 ate a tamale without removing the husk			2
and tonight @entity1 forgot the third agency he wants to eliminate			1
@entity109 goes to show there are too damn many federal agencies			0
" in a 1984 debate against @entity113 , then - president @entity101 delivered a closing statement that was widely viewed as rambling			1
he began by describing a day he had driven down the @entity116 coast			0
@entity101 had to be cut off by the moderator			2
@entity105 , in 1976 , was meeting voters in @entity2 when he bit into a tamale			2
unaware of how to eat it , he did not first remove the husk			0
at wednesday 's debate , @entity1 was facing @entity2 rep. @entity124 when he started to answer the question			1
" i will tell you , it is three agencies of government when i get there that are gone , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity131 , and the -- what 's the third one there ? let 's see			0
@entity136 , @entity137 , and the ... " " @entity138 ? " @entity19 offered			0
" @entity138 , there you go , " @entity1 said			2
when pressed by moderator @entity141 if the @entity138 was indeed the third agency he proposes shuttering , @entity1 admitted that it was n't			2
he then attempted again to remember the details from his plan			0
" the third agency of government i would -- i would do away with @entity137 , the @entity131 , and , let 's see			0
the third one , i ca n't			0
" several minutes later , @entity1 clarified that the agency he was trying to remember was the @entity148			2
@entity1 was already saddled with a series of lackluster debate performances and is down in the polls			1
on @entity153 , reaction was swift			0
can not remember a list of three federal government departments he wants to abolish past the first two			0
and then he says ' oops			0
' he has all but disappeared inside his suit in this debate and is now basically done , " conservative blogger @entity156 tweeted			0
@entity160 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity159 exclaimed , " damn , he actually forgot the third federal agency he would get rid of ! that is the most embarrassing moment of any debate i 've seen ! " appearing in the spin room after the debate , @entity1 tried to make light of the gaffe			1
" i 'm sure glad i had my boots on , " he said , " because i sure stepped in it out there			0
" @entity0 's @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
