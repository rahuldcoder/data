when i was in fourth grade , i wrote vice president @entity2 a letter about my passion for saving the planet			1
i was ecstatic when he wrote back			2
i believed then , as i do now , that he is a strong voice for science and the environment			2
since writing that letter as a 10 - year - old , i 've earned degrees in atmospheric science and environmental engineering			2
at the same time , i 've learned to value the role that science plays in informing public policy			0
meanwhile , @entity2 has become the most visible champion of climate science in public life			1
he famously won the @entity20 for his work on climate education , along with the @entity23 , a group of scientists that compiles climate research from around the world			0
they and other scientists have concluded that human activity -- primarily burning fossil fuels -- puts heat - trapping emissions into the atmosphere that makes heat waves more extreme , increases global sea level , and alters historic precipitation patterns			1
unfortunately , vice president @entity2 took some heat for some comments he made about hurricanes and climate change in an interview with the @entity42			1
initially , the paper misquoted him as saying a new " @entity46 " was being added to the familiar hurricane scale , which maxes out at @entity45			0
category five storms are those that have sustained winds of more than 157 miles per hour			1
as @entity51 , the paper 's weather editor , pointed out , there are no plans by the @entity54 -- the federal office responsible for categorizing storms -- to create a new category			1
later though , we found out that @entity2 merely indicated that some scientists were " proposing " a new category			1
although there is no official proposal on the table , in recent years , at least one scientist has publicly stated the scale might need to be changed			1
for his part , @entity51 later retracted the balance of his criticism this is n't the first time there 's been a public back - and - forth over the science linking hurricanes and climate change			1
scientific understanding there is still evolving			0
and we know that even a sub-category one storm can be terribly destructive , especially when riding atop rising seas			0
when discussing science , politicians -- and scientists -- should lead with what we know with more confidence			0
in the case of climate change , scientists know with great certainty that sea level is rising			1
according to the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) , global average sea level has risen 8 inches over the past century			1
and new @entity91 coastal planning tools show that the @entity93 can expect an additional rise of a foot or more in the next few decades			1
by the end of the century , scientists find , we can expect 3 feet or more , depending on how much more we overload our atmosphere with carbon			0
in human terms , that means many places we now call home will face growing risks from encroaching seas , including iconic shore towns and boardwalks and major cities like @entity110			2
in the short term , we know sea - level rise is making every coastal storm , including hurricanes , more damaging and more deadly			1
the hubbub has also distracted from important points @entity2 made in the rest of the interview			1
the rest of @entity2 's interview was accurate -- and important			1
he correctly explained that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the chief heat - trapping gas , continue to rise			1
countries , including the @entity93 , are far behind the pledges they made to limit warming			2
he also pointed out growing support at the local level for dealing with climate change			2
communities from @entity131 to @entity132 are already grappling with how to zone and build and plan in a world of higher temperature and rising seas			0
fortunately , there 's increasing discomfort with rejections of climate science among the political class			2
while some supporters of climate policy reform occasionally overstate the effects climate change will have on extreme weather , opponents of climate policy often go completely off the rails , accusing scientists of possible criminal behavior and rejecting the reality of climate change itself			0
the latter actions are far more damaging to dialogue around climate policy			0
in fact , they poison our public discourse			0
you ca n't deal with a problem if you refuse to acknowledge it exists			0
the reaction to @entity2 's words -- scorn from his detractors and defense from his allies -- demonstrates just how broken the discussion has become			1
our national discourse around climate change has fallen victim to growing political polarization and the outsize influence of special interests on our democracy			0
far too many politicians are scared of even acknowledging climate change			0
thankfully , there are some depolarizing voices in the debate , such as former rep. @entity182 , @entity184 - @entity183			0
he takes the science as a given and is pushing for climate policies that differ from those president @entity188 recently announced			0
in other words , he 's willing to have a real debate that respects the science			2
those are the conversations we deserve , not more public arguments about the science			0
and i know my fourth - grade - self would agree .			0

@entity42 corrected report that @entity2 cited creation of category 6 storms
@entity2 was *referring* to a scientist 's statement that such a category might be needed
@entity208 : it 's safer to talk about scientifically clear data such as sea level rise
she says @entity2 's basic points were correct , including the rise in @entity217 levels
