-- @entity5 's " @entity6 " joined the growing party of comic book - based tv series with its friday night premiere on @entity5			1
but critics could n't quite agree on whether it was worth staying home ( or even dvring ) to catch it			2
@entity17 stars as @entity6 , a rebellious and not very likable exorcist with an affinity for trench coats and cigarettes -- at least , that 's how he appears in " @entity21 , " the @entity14 comic book upon which the show is based			1
to adhere to network standards , @entity6 ditches his bad habit for tv , a source of contention for @entity28 critic @entity27 and others			1
" the absence of @entity6 's most physically self - destructive habit is symbolic of a larger issue , " he said			1
" and as @entity6 will tell anyone who listens ... symbols have meaning , and when you take them away , you can take away the power they represent			1
" ' @entity6 ' adds to tv 's comic - book trend that 's not all that worries critics about @entity6 , who introduces the real world of demons and ghouls in the premiere			1
fans and critics believe @entity17 's performance will make this show sink or swim , similar to @entity52 on " @entity53 " or @entity54 on " @entity55			1
" for some of them , it 's not looking good			0
" @entity17 is a particular problem , i 'm sorry to say , " vulture 's @entity59 said			1
" i do n't know if he was miscast or poorly directed , but something about his grooming , makeup , and line delivery make him sound like ( and sometimes resemble ) @entity66 in comic high - dudgeon mode			2
" others , however , took a more positive view of his performance			0
" more cynical than @entity76 's @entity75 brothers , almost as quippy as the beloved @entity77 , @entity73 is terrific company for any monstrous apocalypse , " @entity71 of @entity72 said			0
@entity81 's @entity80 was also in the favorable camp			0
" falling somewhere in the middle of the dark / light scale between @entity85 and @entity86 , tonight 's promising premiere boasts a few good jolts , a welcome bit of visual flair , and an appealing star turn from @entity92 actor @entity17 , who conveys just the right mix of tortured soul , biting wit and hunky hero			2
" @entity97 of the @entity98 is holding out hope that the show will improve			0
" there 's good stuff in the pilot â € ” the special effects , for one â € ” and not - so - good stuff , leaving the question up in the air about whether writers @entity108 and @entity110 , who developed the series , can make the fixes necessary to do justice to @entity21			2
" viewers were similarly mixed on @entity115			2
" it was n't mind - blowing , " comics fan @entity116 said			0
" the pacing was off at times			0
but , i enjoyed @entity17 as # @entity6			1
it 's worth another chance			0
" " the best thing about the show is @entity17 's rowdy and committed performance as @entity6 , " another viewer , @entity128 , said on @entity115			1
" for a pilot it was very impressive			0
" what did you think ? will you watch again ? tell us in the comments .			0
