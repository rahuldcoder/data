@entity1 's latest tablet comes in a smaller , pocketable , gripable , adorable new travel size			0
but the @entity3 is more than just a smaller face -- it 's a whole new product with its own killer features and disappointments			2
joining the @entity7 and 10 - inch @entity3 in @entity1 's @entity9 lineup , the 7.8 - inch @entity3 enters a crowded market of 7 - inch tablets			1
here 's a closer look at the @entity3 and how it stacks up against its competitors			2
the body applying the patented @entity1 shrink - ray was n't the only change to the @entity3 body			1
the unibody shell is smooth and rounded on the back and edges -- more so than the 10 - inch @entity3			1
the lack of sharp edges makes it more confortable to hold in your hands			0
the @entity3 is also thinner and lighter than the 10 - inch @entity3			1
the device weighs 0.68 pounds and is 0.28 inches thick			0
that 's thinner than the @entity7			0
being lighter means your arm does n't get tired as fast ( which is good because the new mini smart cover is n't the sturdiest stand )			0
what else is so great about being small ? portability			0
taking the 10 - inch @entity3 outside of the house can be a bit of a slog			1
while it 's a great replacement for bulkier laptops , it 's still larger than a book			2
this little guy was built for reading books in cafes , watching movies in hammocks and playing games on the bus during the morning commute			0
after extensive pocket testing , we found the @entity3 fits in most back pockets , from baggy khakis to skinny jeans ( just do n't sit down )			2
it 's easy to hold it with one hand , though some daintier mitts might find palming it a bit more difficult			0
toss it in a purse , a saddle bag or the glove compartment			0
in many ways , this size feels more natural for a content - consumption device than the larger @entity3			1
the competition while the 10 - inch @entity3 dominates tablet sales around the world , the @entity3 is the new kid in the mid-sized tablet market			1
a crop of 7 - inch tablets on shelves start at $ 199 , including @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity78 's @entity77 tablet and @entity80 's @entity79			1
the @entity3 is different from these devices in a few key ways : it has a slighter larger and wider 7.8 - inch screen , better hardware specs in most categories ( screen resolution is a notable exception , which we 'll revisit later ) , access to the simple and refined @entity9 operating system and @entity1 's vast selection of quality apps and content			1
it also has a much higher price tag			1
the @entity3 starts at $ 329 for the @entity96 only version			2
the top of the line @entity3 is @entity99 , can connect over @entity96 and cellular connections , and costs $ 659			2
when choosing , you 'll have to consider how important the @entity1 features are to you			0
is the extra space and @entity1 ecosystem worth the extra $ 130 ? @entity106 readers and shoppers might get more out of a nook or the @entity110 tablet , which is tightly tied into the @entity75 store			0
( if you 're only interested in reading , do n't count out the amazing 6 - inch , e-ink @entity115 tablet			1
) the @entity3 also has a bit of friendly competition from its own big siblings			2
@entity1 is still selling multiple generations of 10 - inch @entity121 : the ipad 2 and the newer ipad with " @entity124 " ( @entity1 's term )			1
that @entity124 @entity3 was upgraded last month to the fourth generation with a faster processor and a better camera			2
the choice between @entity1 products largely depends on what you 're going to use the device for			0
if it is a laptop replacement , sticking with the faster , larger , higher - resolution 10 - inch @entity3 with @entity135 is still your best bet			1
the exception might be situations where the smaller size is a must - have feature , such as working in the field			2
the price difference between the @entity3 2 and the @entity3 is negligible -- the ipad 2 is only $ 70 more -- so that decision comes down to size preference and specs like camera resolution			1
the @entity3 has better cameras -- the same ones found on the newest 10 - inch @entity3			1
the screen this might be a sticking point for some buyers			0
the @entity3 screen is basically the ipad 2 screen shrunk down to 7.8 inches			2
the two devices have the same number of pixels ( 1024 - by - 768 ) , but the @entity3 just packs them into a smaller space			1
the @entity3 2 has 132 pixels per inch , the @entity3 has 163 pixels per inch			1
there are a few reasons @entity1 might have gone this direction			0
the benefit of using the @entity3 2 's display size is that all the apps designed to work on the @entity3 will work perfectly on the @entity3 , do developers do n't have to redesign their products			1
also , the full retina display found on the latest @entity3 would likely have been a huge drain on battery life			1
( we did n't do official battery tests on the @entity3 , but we did n't need to charge it once in three days , even after streaming this @entity177 documentary on @entity178 , testing out various apps and surfing the @entity180 frequently			2
) touchscreen technology has marched on since the @entity3 2			2
the third - and fourth - generation @entity121 both have 2048 - by - 1536 , 264 pixels - per - inch @entity124 screens			1
all three of the main competing 7 - inch tablets -- the @entity110 , @entity185 and @entity77 -- also have higher - resolution screens			1
if you 've never used a higher - resolution display , you might not even notice			0
but if you 're already using a device with a better screen , the @entity3 can look a bit grainy			0
it 's like eating at @entity194 and then trying to go back to @entity195 's			0
what is great about the display is how it fills the front of the device			0
the edges around the touchscreen , called bezels , are incredibly thin on the left and right sides			0
@entity1 also tweaked the software so that the screen is less sensitive to an errant thumb resting on the front of the device			0
other specs the screen is n't the only thing the @entity3 got from the @entity211			0
it is using the same processor , the @entity214			0
this processor is now two generations old , but it also does n't have to power a big retina display , so it continues to feel speedy			1
there are two speakers for some decent stereo sound ( not one as originally thought , according to an @entity222 teardown ) , and the @entity3 uses the new lightning connecter port			0
the cameras on the @entity3 are n't as good as the @entity7 , but they are exactly the same as what you 'll find on the newest @entity3			0
taking a photo on the 10 - inch @entity3 has always seemed awkward , but holding up an @entity3 to take a quick video feels a bit more natural .			1

the @entity3 hits the spot with its perfectly portable size , but the price tag is high
buyers could be disappointed by the lack of a retina display on the @entity3
@entity3 is great for consuming content , but 10 - inch @entity3 is still best as a @entity241 replacement
