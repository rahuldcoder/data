-- do n't worry if you did not hear the news about @entity3 impeaching its president			1
after all , it happened so fast that even @entity3 's neighbors are figuring out how to react			1
@entity3 , the small @entity8 nation known as an " island surrounded by land , " often goes unnoticed outside of @entity8			1
but there is an absorbing story behind the impeachment of @entity14 that has turned into a regional crisis that is still unfolding			1
the impeachment procedures appear to have been carried out in accordance with the @entity18 , but some @entity20 presidents are calling it a coup d'etat and refuse to recognize the new president , @entity23			1
@entity3 swears in new leader after impeachment @entity14 went from president to disgraced leader in less than 48 hours			1
in the @entity28 , nearly three months passed in 1998 between the time lawmakers announced they were considering impeaching @entity30 and the actual vote			0
in @entity14 's case , it took one day			1
@entity30 's lawyers spent 30 hours over two days on his defense , not counting witnesses they called			0
before the @entity3 @entity38 , @entity14 's defense team had two hours			1
the biggest difference : @entity30 survived , @entity14 was swept out			2
eight days ago , there was no reason to believe that @entity14 would find himself out of a job before his term ended in august 2013			2
he was an unpopular president among lawmakers , and many had concerns about his credibility as a leader after the former @entity50 bishop admitted to having fathered at least two children			0
in all , four women claim they had babies by @entity14 while he was bishop			2
there had been calls in the past for his impeachment , but the scandals did not rock his position too much			0

peasants fired on police who were trying to evict them from private property , initiating the deadly confrontation , local authorities and state - run media said			0
the violence occurred in @entity71 , a remote community about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) northeast of the @entity3 capital , @entity74 , near the @entity76 border			2
in response to the incident , @entity14 replaced his national police chief and interior minister			2

the vote in favor of impeachment was 76 - 1			0
the next day , @entity14 's defense team had two hours to defend @entity14 from what it call vague charges of incompetence			2
the @entity38 impeached the president in a 39 - 4 vote			0
" @entity3 history ( and ) its democracy that has been deeply wounded , " @entity14 said after accepting his fate			1
but the swiftness of the action has led to condemnation , or at least criticism from other @entity20 countries			0
" if indeed it is recognized that the impeachment process happened according to the procedure established in the @entity18 , @entity113 considers that the process did not offer president @entity14 the space and time for a proper defense , " @entity113 's foreign ministry said			1
the presidents of @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124 said they will not recognize @entity23 's administration , and @entity121 on saturday withdrew its ambassador to @entity3			1
@entity122 " will not recognize a government that does not rise from the ballot box and the will of the people , " @entity122 president @entity127 said			1
@entity120 president @entity132 said , " i have no doubt that president @entity14 was not given a right to his defense , it happened from one day to the next , and the sentence was decided before the trial			1
" as of friday night , not a single international leader had called him to congratulate him on his being sworn in as president , @entity23 told @entity0 en @entity141			1
" of course it worries me			0
i am aware that i am assuming the presidency in an unfavorable condition , " he said			0
@entity23 reiterated that the impeachment happened within the parameters of the constitution , and pointed to the large margins by which @entity14 was voted out of office			1
" it means that here we have a unanimous position			0
the @entity3 people , i think , are satisfied with this decision , " he said			2
despite the cold shoulder from neighboring countries , @entity23 said he will reach out and explain the legality of @entity14 's ouster and seeks to have good international relations			1
his goal is for @entity3 to be recognized internationally by the time he hands the government over to the next president next year , he said			1
" i have the duty and the responsibility to initiate a process that the next government can continue , " he said , especially when it comes to important domestic issues such as security and family agriculture			0
most of the countries opposed to @entity23 's presidency belong to the @entity174 , known as @entity174			0
the foreign ministers of that regional body were in @entity3 to study the issue			0
the @entity174 ministers " have an attitude of respect for the sovereignty of @entity3 , but also an attitude of respect for democracy , " @entity76 president @entity178 said			1
@entity76 is one of @entity3 's most important neighbors , and @entity178 declined to give a strong position one way or another over the recent events			0

the @entity28 also weighed in a more neutral manner			0
