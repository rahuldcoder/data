@entity0 -- the sister of presidential assailant @entity3 testified tuesday that she has seen no sign that her brother represents a danger to himself or others			1
@entity8 , who said she loves her brother , said she supports a proposal that would expand his visits to their mother 's home in @entity14 , @entity15 , and might eventually allow him to live there as a full - time outpatient			1
but she said she does not think it would be a good option for him to move to the @entity20 area , where she lives			0
" president @entity24 lives not 10 minutes from me and i think it would be a concern , " said @entity21 , apparently referring to concerns the @entity23 might have			0
former president @entity24 and his wife , @entity28 , moved to @entity20 after they left the @entity30			0
@entity21 said she has no worries that @entity3 would be a risk to others in @entity20			1
@entity36 district judge @entity35 asked if it is accurate she is worried about her brother 's personal safety in @entity20 , since that is the city where president @entity42 was assassinated in 1963			1
" that 's a concern to me , " @entity21 said quietly			0
she also said she thinks a move to @entity20 would place @entity3 too far away from the medical experts who have cared for him for many years			1
@entity3 's sister testified on the fourth day of a multiple - day hearing to discuss his future			1
@entity3 was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of president @entity53 , press secretary @entity54 , @entity23 agent @entity55 , and police officer @entity56			1
all of those men survived , though @entity54 was shot in the head and left permanently disabled			0
@entity3 was staying at the home of his sister and her husband in @entity20 on october 13 , 1980 , when , according to testimony in his 1982 trial , he went to a pawn shop to buy two .22 - caliber revolvers , one of which he used to shoot @entity53 and the others five months later			1
only days before the purchase , three guns had been confiscated from @entity3 's luggage while he was trying to board a plane in @entity72			1
@entity3 posted bond , was released and flew to @entity74 , then spent the night in @entity75 , @entity76 , where actress @entity77 was a college freshman student			1
he flew to @entity20 to stay that weekend at his sister 's home while she and her husband were away at a football game			2
on that monday , @entity3 told her he was going out to look for a job , but , unknown to her , he bought the guns instead			2
the gun purchase was not mentioned in court tuesday , and the government has not said it would be more dangerous for @entity3 to live in @entity20 than anywhere else			1
since his conviction , @entity3 has been living in @entity88 , a government mental hospital in @entity0			1
but in recent years he 's been allowed to visit his mother 's home with increasing frequency			0
currently , he spends 10 days a month in @entity14			2
under the proposal made by @entity88 he would be granted two visits of 17 days each followed by six visits of 24 days			0
the hospital 's recommendation for @entity3 's eventual release on convalescent leave asks the judge to allow @entity3 to live full time in @entity14 " at the discretion of the hospital " once the eight longer visits have been completed successfully			1
the report was filed with the court under seal on july 29 and was not made public until tuesday			0
the doctors signing the report said such leave would be permitted only upon an assessment , at the end of the new visits , that " mr. @entity3 is experiencing a good mental status and that he does not present as [ sic ] a danger to himself or others			2
" if so , the recommendation said , @entity3 would be " conditionally released to reside permanently on convalescent leave			2
" he would be required to meet at least once a month with a psychiatrist who is already counseling him in @entity14 and to continue his weekly visits to a therapist there			2
he would also be expected to continue his volunteer activities at @entity122			0
however , the filing said , should @entity3 violate the terms of his convalescent leave , " the hospital will return him to total inpatient care with due notification of the court			1
" if the judge were to grant convalescent leave at the hospital 's discretion at the end of the eight longer visits now requested , it would be unlikely to happen until at least the fall of 2012 , since as the filing requires a minimum two - week interval between each of the new visits			2
@entity3 would be expected at the outset to live with his widowed mother , who is turning 86 this week and is in good health			1
however , the hospital said should his " mother not be available " after @entity3 's release , his brother and sister had expressed interest " in the housing options of independent apartments as well as @entity152 ... in the @entity14 area			1
" @entity21 often spends time in @entity14 when @entity3 is there and drives him back to @entity88			1
she was asked many questions about how the 56 - year - old fits into the @entity15 community			0
she said he feels comfortable there and has indicated he wants to stay there even when his elderly mother is no longer there			1
according to @entity21 , @entity3 likes working part time in the library of @entity122 and is comfortable with the psychiatrist and case manager / therapist he sees while in @entity14			1
under questioning , @entity21 acknowledged the family does not permit a woman identified in court only as @entity169 to visit the @entity171 home			0
@entity3 at one time told some of his caregivers at @entity88 that he was engaged to @entity169 , who had been a patient there			2
@entity3 later ended the engagement , doctors have said			2
prosecutors described @entity169 as being psychologically unstable and asked if it was accurate @entity3 's mother does not allow her to visit for fear she would have a mental breakdown at the home			1
@entity21 said that is the case			0
@entity21 said her brother never told the family he was engaged and -- quite to the contrary -- has said he 's not engaged and has no plans to marry the woman			0
she said she is aware her brother still sees @entity169 sometimes when the woman visits @entity88			0
previously the court heard testimony that @entity21 had taken her brother to a singles group meeting in @entity14 a number of years ago , and he was asked to leave			2
@entity21 said she wanted to set the record straight about what happened			0
she and her brother believed members of the group knew they were coming , but that was not the case , she said			0
the group was surprised to see @entity3 there , she said			2
but she said all the members were in their mid- 70s and her brother would not have fit in			0
@entity21 said that when her brother goes out in the community he usually has no problems with people who recognize him			0
" he 's not bothered by people , he 's not pointed out , " she told the court			0
she said , " he does n't bother anybody " either			0
she said @entity3 and his family members find they are able to go to certain restaurants where people know who they are but are welcoming			1
" in general , the people in town have been very tolerant , " she said			0
last week , prosecutors said @entity3 had not told the truth about deviating from his approved itinerary to go to a movie while on his few hours of permitted unaccompanied time			2
according to a report by @entity23 agents who were watching @entity3 without his knowledge , on one outing last july , @entity3 did not attend a movie and instead went to a bookstore where he passed by an aisle of books that included an account of the day @entity53 was shot			1
the judge noted the report did not indicate that @entity3 read that book or any similar books			2
" the subject was not observed picking up and looking at specific books , " the report says			0
" one item of note is the subject stopped for a time and looked at the shelves in the @entity242 area that contain several books about president @entity53 and his attempted assassination			1
" @entity3 's sister said she had accompanied him to bookstores and never saw him look at any books like that			1
she said he gravitated to books on music and art. but in response to questioning by a prosecutor , she said she was n't aware @entity3 had failed to go to the movies as planned on two occasions , in july and in september			0
@entity21 was asked if she ever noticed @entity23 agents keeping an eye on @entity3			0
she replied the only time she has noticed surveillance is when she drives @entity3 out of her mother 's gated community and back to @entity88			1
she said agents are always waiting in a vehicle and follow along			0
but at the end of a march 2011 visit , the @entity23 was not waiting , she said			0
according to @entity21 , about midway through the trip to @entity0 , @entity3 's brother , @entity267 , got a call on his cell phone from an agent who said he had been late			1
@entity21 said the agent asked the @entity3 family 's location and requested that they wait for him to catch up			1
@entity21 replied the family did and was happy to cooperate with the @entity23			0
@entity1 's @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
