-- @entity1 believed he was about to get lucky			0
a woman he 'd met earlier that night was making her way toward his bedroom			0
it did n't go unnoticed			0
" what 's your deal ? are you gay ? " the woman asked			1
no. he was n't gay			0
" what is it ? " she wondered			0
" oh my gosh ! do you have an std ? " no , it was n't that either			0
alarmed , she stepped away from him			0
" oh my @entity20 ! yes , you do			0
you have an @entity16 , " he recalls her saying emphatically			1
@entity1 confessed what was bothering him -- he barely knew this woman			0
" no , " he told her			0
" i 'm afraid you might			0
" she slapped him across the face and walked out of the room			0
it 's the kind of awkward moment a lot of men might prefer to forget , but for @entity1 it was the impetus for starting his company , @entity35 , a free website that lets users text and share their verified sexually transmitted disease results with potential partners			1
" i remember sitting back thinking , ' there 's got to be a better way , ' " @entity1 says			1
at any given time , there are 110 million sexually transmitted infections among men and women across the nation , according to the @entity49			0
young people contract half of all new cases			0
they 're also tech - savvy , and that 's driving the development of new high - tech std prevention tools geared toward them			1
@entity35 users can share their verified test results for @entity58 , chlamydia , gonorrhea and syphilis			1
their status comes directly from their own @entity63 health care provider			0
it shows when they got tested and includes a disclaimer that notes the user may have had sex since then			2
the company promotes the service as a way to " spread the love , nothing else			0
" it 's a modern , flirtatious version of " i 'll show you mine , if you show me yours , " @entity75 says , that can make would - be lovers more attractive to each other			2
" we 're lining the idea of getting tested with actually getting more action , " he says			1
another @entity16 tech tool helps people have difficult conversations with past lovers			1
studies show 23 % of partners of people diagnosed with stds are ever warned they might also be at risk			2
at @entity94 , users can provide that warning anonymously by e-mail for free			1
" there is obviously a lot of anxiety with talking to a past partner about a diagnosis , particularly if you 're not close to that person , or if it was a casual partner , or if it was someone that you had a falling out with , " says @entity97 , the company 's director of operations			1
" we 're hoping to get those patients who would n't normally tell their partners to do it through our anonymous service			1
" the @entity63 - based service lets users notify former partners about chlamydia , gonorrhea and trichomoniasis			1
the anonymous e-mail has information about the @entity16 exposure and where the recipient can go to get tested			1
users are asked to certify that they are sending the e-mail for the right reasons , but the site does n't require the results to be verified			1
recipients can report misuse of the service to the company			0
for users who are willing to speak to their former sex partners , the site also offers scripts for the difficult discussion			1
another std tech tool out there is an app called @entity137			2
worried you might have symptoms of an std ? this service lets you take a picture of a rash , for example , on your private parts , and for about $ 40 , you can send it in and get a response back from a doctor within a day about what it might be			1
the app screens for stds that result in physical symptoms such as syphilis , herpes and genital warts			2
twenty - five percent of the images screened are actually @entity16 , the company says			1
often the images show something else entirely , such as an infected hair follicle			0
" there are a lot of worried people out there , " says the company 's founder , @entity160			1
" people actually think they have an infection and they do n't			0
" the service is available internationally			0
the screenings are not definitive -- they only provide potential diagnoses			2
the results include information about what the user may be experiencing and recommendations for treatment , including when to see a dermatologist or visit an std clinic to have the diagnosis verified			2
" we 're not a diagnostic service			2
we 're not trying to substitute the doctor relationship , " @entity160 says			1
" we 're getting the right patient at the right time to the right level of health care			2

users can text and share @entity16 test results with potential partners
you can also e-mail former partners anonymously to tell them to get tested
an app enlists a doctor 's help if you 're worried you might have an @entity16
