-- librarians across the @entity2 are making noise about new federal restrictions on lead that could take books out of the hands of children			1
children 's books are covered by federal regulations on lead in items made for children			1
the @entity15 requires all products , including books intended for children younger than 12 , to meet new standards calling for lower lead content			1
commission regulations , written in response to the law , take effect february 10			0
even stricter limits will become effective in august			0
@entity26 , ink , covers and glues would need to pass lead content standards			1
" while we understand the process the @entity36 must carry out in order to ensure this law is properly enforced and that the safety of our nation 's children is protected , we believe the commission is wasting time and resources by zeroing in on book publishers and libraries , " said @entity30 , executive director of the @entity33 @entity32 office			1
" it is our hope that this matter will be resolved soon , so that libraries can continue their efforts to serve children without the threat of closing their doors			0
" the @entity36 is expected to issue guidance early next week , said @entity57 , spokeswoman for sen. @entity58 , @entity59 , who sponsored the legislation in the @entity61 last year			1
the bill , sponsored in the @entity63 by rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , was prompted by a rash of recalls of lead - and phthalate - tainted products , many of which were manufactured in @entity72			0
long - term exposure to lead can cause nervous system and kidney damage ; speech , language , hearing and behavioral problems ; and learning difficulties , according to the @entity82 's web site			2
@entity58 is frustrated with the product safety commission			0
" the new law is not and was not intended to be a one - size - fits - all mandate , " he said in an earlier statement			0
" there is simply no excuse for the @entity36 's slow action on these rulemakings			1
" a consumer advocate concurred with @entity58			1
" i do n't think the law needs to be adjusted , " said @entity92 , director of @entity95 's @entity94 division			2
" the law provides means for the @entity36 to evaluate and decide whether exemptions should be granted for certain types of products			1
" @entity36 spokeswoman @entity101 said the agency would comment on the issue later friday			2
ordinary books that are n't made to be playthings ( such as vinyl bathtub books ) and that do n't have baubles or other materials on their covers have always been exempt from regulations on lead in paint			2
but the new regulations on lead in children 's products do cover all kinds of books , according to a december 23 letter from the @entity36 's office of general counsel to the @entity122			1
librarians say there 's no way they can verify the lead content of all the books on their children 's department shelves			1
" the cost would be unbelievably high for them to test all these books so we could keep them in the library , and how long would we go without them if every library in @entity142 sends them to the same lab , " @entity130 , librarian at the @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity134			2
@entity92 is unmoved by such arguments			0
" if libraries can provide evidence that broad classes of books do n't pose a risk of harm to the public health , then they can be granted an exemption from the testing requirements , " he said			1
" if they ca n't prove that and if the books actually do pose a safety problem , then they should n't be sent home with kids			0
" publishers -- which will have to prove the safety of new books anyway -- and groups such as the @entity33 could foot the bill for testing older books , he said			2
" they do n't have to test every book , obviously , " @entity92 said			0
" they do n't even have to test anywhere near every title			0
i think they really have to test a reasonable sample size of different classes of books -- different types of binding , different types of materials used			0
" a coalition of consumer advocacy groups continues to support the law but issued a statement friday that criticized the @entity36 's implementation of it			1
" while we have urged the @entity15 to promptly address reasonable concerns that have been raised regarding compliance , and provide better information about the new law , our organizations all agree that the law is fundamentally sound and essential to ensuring a safer marketplace , " the statement read			0
it was signed by @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , kids in @entity198 , @entity2 @entity199 and @entity95			0
the commission earlier this month clarified the regulations to let resale and thrift shops off the hook for testing the used clothing and other items they sell			0
those outlets still are expected to watch out for items that have been recalled or banned , the @entity36 said .			2

law may require pulling children 's books until lead content is determined
librarians worry about cost , *practicality* of testing all books
@entity226 's sponsor criticizes @entity36 for *failure* to give clear guidance
