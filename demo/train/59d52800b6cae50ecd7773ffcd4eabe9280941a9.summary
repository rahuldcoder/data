@entity0 -- not everyone expects a response when they write a letter to the president of the @entity7			1
but @entity8 got much more than she expected when her husband ended up in jail and afraid he would be deported			1
@entity8 , vice president of marketing at a new - media advertising company , wrote president @entity12 in january because her husband , @entity13 , was facing deportation to his native @entity15			1
@entity13 failed in a bid before political asylum almost a decade ago , and a judge issued a deportation order after they were married			2
after he and @entity8 married on 2005 , @entity13 applied for a green card based on his marriage to a @entity7 citizen			0
but immigration law requires that the deportation order be lifted before the couple can appear before immigration officials to argue their case that the marriage is legitimate and not a ploy to legalize @entity13 's presence in the @entity7			2
" we want to be given the chance to interview and prove that we are a married couple , so @entity13 can get a green card , and that has proven extremely difficult to do , " @entity8 told @entity1			0
they never received a direct response to the letter			2
but they did get two @entity42 ( @entity42 ) officers waiting outside their @entity43 , @entity45 apartment on june 3 when @entity13 was leaving the apartment to go to the gym			1
@entity8 told @entity1 that the officers cornered her husband and asked him if he had written a letter to the president			1
" he said ' no , but my wife did			0
' and they explained that with that letter -- when it was brought to their attention -- that the @entity12 administration wanted them to resolve this quickly , ' " @entity8 said			1
her husband was held at @entity42 headquarters for six hours , alone in a room , until he was chained at the wrists , around his stomach and his ankles and taken to the @entity62 in @entity63 , she said			1
for the next two weeks , a frantic @entity8 wrote letters to politicians and anyone else who might be able to help			2
she got responses , she said , but none seemed to lead anywhere			0
@entity13 was allowed to call his wife once a day at designated times but he knew little about his situation			0
he spent his days with repeat sex offenders and men accused of felonies , fearing imminent deportation			0
" i did everything i could and went into survival mode and pushed for all these connections to the press , " she said			0
" we are fortunate to have that leverage			0
what about the people in the country who do n't have access to those means ? " then , on thursday , he was brought to an immigration processing jail in @entity45 and released			1
there was no explanation offered for his release , but @entity13 is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor while his case is being reviewed			2
@entity42 spokesman @entity97 said the circumstances of @entity13 's arrest were undergoing an internal review and he was released as " an alternative to detention pending a review of his case			1
" investigators are looking to determine whether " appropriate separation " between @entity8 's letter to the president and @entity13 's deportation case were violated			1
if so , he said , the case will go to the @entity111 and the @entity113 's inspector general for " immediate and appropriate action			2
" @entity13 graduated from the @entity115 at @entity116 with an engineering degree in 2008 and received several job interview offers after graduation			0
but the deportation order hung over his head and prevented any followup			0
" all he wants to do is contribute to this economy , " @entity8 told @entity1			0
" we want to be a productive couple			0
he 's been dying to work			0
" the couple has been following @entity12 's rise in the political world since 2004			1
" i felt a special kinship to him because i 'm of mixed race , and my husband obviously has a similar background , " @entity8 told @entity1			2
regardless of whether or not her letter was mishandled , the incident has deeply affected the couple 's faith in the @entity12 administration			1
" i feel really confused , i do n't understand how something like this is possible			0
i ca n't imagine that at the top of the @entity12 administration that they realize that something like this is happening , " @entity8 told @entity1 .			1
