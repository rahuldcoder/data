-- it 's a stirring sight , and it happens just once a year -- a full field of thoroughbred gray horses thundering down one of @entity6 's most famous racecourses in a fiercely - contested handicap event			1
" you do n't have to be a racing purist to appreciate the spectacle of 19 gray horses charging down the @entity14 , " @entity9 's pr manager @entity8 told @entity0			1
" there are not many of them , it 's their scarcity that gives them cult appeal			2
" once described as " diseased " and genetically inferior , gray horses have achieved a special place in hearts of racing fans in recent decades -- winning some of the industry 's biggest events			1
the @entity9 handicap was first run in 2003 and has grown in popularity with both the professional racing fraternity and the general public			1
the 2012 version was won in fine style this month by @entity35 , ridden by @entity36 , and once again attracted interest over and above the moderate standard of the runners			0
tough winners but the enduring appeal and popularity of grays is well known in racing circles			1
" it 's a wonderful spectacle with wonderful - looking horses			2
and it 's very good for racing , " says @entity47 , a former jockey who trained last year 's winner @entity49 -- which this time finished outside the placings			2
so why are gray horses so popular ? @entity47 believes it 's because they are perceived as good bets for punters			1
" they 're tough horses and many are winners , " he told @entity0			0
some of the greatest flat performers in the @entity63 have been grays -- going back to early 1950s with the great @entity66 , who has sired a line of champions			1
@entity69 , the managing editor of the influential website @entity71 , said that the legendary colt , who was nicknamed the " @entity74 , " made his reputation as the sport was being shown widely on television for the first time			0
" the fact that here was a gray horse that won so often made him even more famous because he stood out , " he told @entity0			1
native dancer was named @entity84 twice , and other grays to win the award include @entity87 ( 1980 ) , @entity88 ( 1986 ) and @entity89 ( 1998 )			2
rated greatest @entity90 has a soft spot for @entity88 , a filly sired by the legendary secretariat , who is rated by many the greatest racehorse of all time			0
he was taken by his father to watch the @entity99 in @entity100 in 1973 when @entity93 completed the @entity101 by adding a devastating 31 - length victory to his @entity104 and @entity105 successes			2
" the stand literally shook that day , " @entity69 recalled			0
@entity88 was one of @entity93 's best offspring -- and as a gray filly she had a double affinity with race followers			1
" when a top filly races against colts , it 's similar to how people feel about a gray racing against more common colors , " @entity69 said			1
this year 's gray attraction in the @entity63 has been the striking colt @entity121 -- almost white by pigmentation			1
he failed to live up to the promise shown as the top juvenile in 2011 and was out of the placings at the @entity104 , but has a " big fan base " according to @entity90			0
a desert bloom on the other side of the @entity129 , the gray @entity130 -- " @entity131 " to his fans -- was one of the most popular horses in the history of the sport			1
racing over the national hunt jumps , @entity130 won the @entity139 in 1988 and the @entity140 at @entity141 four times			2
there is an eye - catching statue in his honor at that track in west @entity149			2
this year , the gray @entity150 won the @entity151 at @entity152 , a feat which eluded @entity131 , who never ran in the prestigious @entity6 race			1
both these great grays stood out even more because , as older horses , their coats had grown even lighter with age			0
the official definition of a gray is outlined in " @entity162 -- instructions for @entity169 , " a book produced by @entity164 in conjunction with the @entity166 and @entity6 @entity167			0
all thoroughbreds listed by @entity164 in the @entity6 have to have their coloring and markings registered by a veterinary surgeon			0
" the body coat is a mixture of black and white hairs , with the skin black			0
with increasing age the coat grows lighter in color , " reads the definition			0
nature 's anomaly official figures confirm that grays are a rarity			1
weatherbys ' " @entity187 for 2011 " records that 2.8 % of the foal crop in the @entity6 were registered as gray , with bay the most prevalent color at 73.3 %			0
@entity194 was next at 20.4 % , then brown at 3 %			0
in genetic terms , to breed a thoroughbred gray one of the parents has to be so colored -- but it was not always a popular combination			1
@entity201 @entity200 ( 1869 - 1954 ) is renowned as one of the most successful breeders in the history of horse racing			1
at his @entity206 in @entity207 near @entity208 , @entity200 and his wife bred and trained a string of great champions over a half - century period			0
his books on the subject are still " must reads " for aspiring thoroughbred breeders , but he insisted gray horses were " diseased " not just differently colored and his views proved influential			0
@entity219 indeed are more likely to develop tumors , known as melanomas , but many are benign			0
while gray hairs are a sign of aging ( as in humans ) this is exacerbated for horses as pigment is prevented from reaching the hair			0
perhaps because of @entity200 's views , grays were out of vogue and even segregated into gray - only races , not for the positive reasons that prompt the race at @entity9 and others in the @entity63			1
the stunning success of @entity66 and his offspring would have done much to change attitudes and in and era dominated by television , their ability to stand out in a packed field is priceless			0
" fans gravitate to gray horses because they are rare and it 's easy to spot them , " concluded @entity69 .			2
