-- @entity2 , 50 , was college educated , married , worked in middle management at a financial services company and had good health insurance			1
she was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in 1990			2
she saw doctors with some of the best reputations			2
after an appropriate surgery , she was given high dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant			0
the treatment almost killed her several times and she was hospitalized for nearly a year			0
my book , " how we do harm , " co-authored with @entity16 describes the challenges that some ordinary @entity21 experience while trying to get quality health care			1
in the book we show real examples , like @entity2 , of the irrationality of how medicine is practiced and consumed in the @entity21			1
we discuss those who do not get good care and those who suffer because of excessive and illogical health care			1
both occur among the insured and the uninsured			0
the book also assesses the threat our health care system poses to the economy and offers suggestions on what needs to change			1
it was motivated by the ongoing debate about health care reform			1
for more than two decades , i have studied disparities in health outcomes and the inconsistencies in how medicine is practiced			1
i have come to believe that much of the rhetoric for and against health care reform lacks the understanding that the issue involves human beings			1
lost in that debate is the fact that a large number of our fellow @entity21 are suffering and dying avoidable deaths , because of lack of quality health care			1
i believe we should be both ashamed and furious about our health care system			1
@entity21 spends more per person on health care than any other country			1
per - person costs are nearly 1.5 times higher than the second most expensive country			0
we simply do not get the outcomes we pay for			0
among the nations of the world , we rank 50th in life expectancy and @entity21 life expectancy is decreasing			1
@entity21 is 47th in infant mortality , just better than @entity70			1
the therapy @entity2 received was expensive and commonly given to women with breast cancer in the early 1990s			0
during this time , numerous women sued insurance companies who did not want to pay for the therapy and nearly a dozen states passed laws saying insurance companies had to pay for it			0
there was one really good reason why the health insurers did not want to pay for high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant for breast cancer : no study had ever been done to prove it beneficial			2
even without evidence , some patients and their doctors had faith that it worked			0
the procedure was common because some doctors taught that the transplant was beneficial to patients			0
truth be told , it was very beneficial to the doctors and hospitals offering it			0
by 1999 , well after @entity2 had recovered , three well - designed clinical trials were completed			0
they showed that bone marrow transplant and high dose chemotherapy , a treatment now common for nearly a decade and a half , was not better than the standard therapy and there were indications it was more harmful			0
this shows that even the well - insured often get substandard care			2
medical gluttony , the inappropriate use and overuse of medical treatment , is not just adding unnecessary cost to health care			1
it can actually be harmful to the individual			0
doctors deserve some blame for this mess			0
appreciation of the science of medicine and the scientific method is often lacking			0
it is amazing the number of health care professionals who seemingly reject the scientific method			1
they prescribe treatments they believe to be appropriate as opposed to therapies that are known to be appropriate based on objective scientific evidence			0
this form of ignorance is a root cause of much of the overuse of medical therapy			0
too often , doctors fail to distinguish what is scientifically known from what is unknown , from what is believed			0
this is beyond mere disagreement about interpretation of the science			0
there is often selective reading of the science , especially by those trained in a specialty wanting to advocate for it			0
health care providers and the public often overlook the emotional and financial conflicts of interest of health care professionals			1
while i blame the medical profession , blame also rests on hospitals , drug and device manufacturers , insurance companies , lawyers , politicians , government and even with patients			0
i see hospitals advocating unproven screening and treatment while advertising for business			0
there are patient advocacy groups often funded by hospitals and medical manufacturers , who also advocate the unproven and instill in patients that they need what may be unnecessary and can be harmful			0
@entity21 medicine is big business			1
it is about 18 % of the @entity21 economy and growing			1
the average cost of a health insurance policy for a family of four is $ 19,400 per year			2
the expense of our inefficient health care system is a major drain on the economy			1
it is a major reason why employers are hesitant to hire and a reason why many employers can not provide health insurance to employees			2
we have what could be an extraordinary health care system and some patients do get extraordinary care			1
but patient stories show how our system is inefficient			2
our system is focused on treating people after they get sick with relative inattention to promoting health and preventing disease			1
such public health efforts have not received adequate support			2
the triad of obesity , lack of physical activity and high caloric intake ( bad diet ) is creating a tsunami of chronic disease			2
if the system persists as is , medical costs will grow dramatically over the next several decades as the number of patients with diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , cancer and orthopedic injury dramatically grows			2
the current course is not sustainable			0
medical costs will rise until the economy collapses			0
i know that the book will upset and anger some people , especially those who profit from medicine			2
i hope the book allows some reasonable people ( both lay and medical professionals ) to better understand what we are doing to our country			2
we all need to realize that some @entity21 are harmed by lack of treatment and others by overtreatment			1
the cold hard reality is @entity21 does not need to reform health care , we need to transform health care			1
the @entity21 health care system is fundamentally flawed and encourages inappropriate behavior and a subtle form of corruption			1
there truly is a combination of greed , ignorance and apathy within health care that is a cancer on this country			1
there is nothing wrong with medicine as a business , and nothing wrong with making an honest profit			0
however , in some cases , greed needs to be replaced with public interest , a concern for the national good			0
we need a greater commitment to the practice of evidence - based medicine			0
some politicians choose to scare people with words like " rationing medicine " and " death panels			2
" truth be told , we all need to talk about defining the " rational use of medicine			0
" a widespread demand for rational use of health care can lower costs and increase the number of people getting high quality care and save lives			1
@entity21 need to better understand the science of medicine and the scientific method , be true to science and support evidence - based medicine			1
we need to embrace an interest in public health and adopt preventive strategies			2
the most important question we can ask is , " how can we provide all @entity21 with good high quality care to include preventive care ? " opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of @entity0 , @entity306 , or @entity307 .			1

@entity21 ranks 50th in life expectancy and @entity21 life expectancy is decreasing
we should be both ashamed and furious about our health care system , @entity312 says
we focus on treating people after they get sick instead of preventing disease , he says
