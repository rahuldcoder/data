two years after @entity1 's prime minister @entity0 unveiled his plan to finally break the country 's economy free from more than 20 years of under - performance , the much - hoped - for renaissance has not filtered down to everyone			1
standing near a 100 - meter long queue for lottery tickets in @entity13 's wealthy @entity12 district , 34 - year - old nurse @entity8 is still waiting for proof that it is working			2
" i hear that @entity15 is bringing merit to big companies , but for small companies like my husband 's one , there is no benefit , " she says			1
" and for me as a nurse there are no benefits either			0
" there are changes but , for her , not good ones			0
she notes that the price of food has gone " up and up " over the past year and that life for her is starting to get tight			0
" i wish that @entity15 would bring my quality of life up , because at the moment it 's just the rich people who are getting the benefits			1
" a 78 - year - old man standing nearby , who would only give his name as mr. @entity41 , agreed			0
" they say that employment is getting better , but all i see is the price of things going up , and that is hurting me			0
" but rising prices is actually one of the key targets of @entity15			1
after more than a decade of deflation , where prices fell and consumers held back from spending in the hope they would fall further , a combination of pumping money through the system and cutting the value of the yen which makes imports more expensive , is having the desired affect			2
read more : @entity0 's election gamble puts policies on the line @entity1 are getting out and spending more and prices are rising			1
or at least they were -- until a new consumption tax was introduced in april which not only stopped spending in its tracks , but sent the economy into recession			2
to be fair , the tax was a hangover from a previous government , but @entity0 's @entity75 did support it			1
but there are still plenty of winners from @entity15			1
@entity79 is a 37 - year - old construction company employee			0
he says that his salary is up 3 % this year and he is now getting fat bonuses as a result of the government - backed boom in construction			0
" i am getting a big boost from @entity15			1
we do n't have enough people for all the work , " he says			0
certainly , the unemployment rate in @entity1 is the envy of the developed world at under 3 %			1
companies are on a hiring spree as the yen weakens and exports become more competitive			0
at home , the service industry is also booming			0
according to @entity102 's managing director and head of research , @entity99 , 130,000 jobs a month have been created since @entity15 kicked off			1
" the key issue is whether the economy is creating jobs , and the answer is absolutely yes			2
on top of that you have corporates making more money , they have basically doubled , so you have employment up and profit up and consumer sentiment on the rise			0
" but there are still plenty of @entity1 who are not a part of this picture			2
and they are they people that @entity0 needs to convince if he is to stay in power .			2

two years after its introduction , @entity15 is yet to benefit all @entity1
some *sectors* of the economy are doing well out of the @entity1 @entity131 's *flagship* policy
but rising prices mean that not all @entity1 are fans of the policy
@entity0 is painting the *impending* *general* election as a *referendum* on @entity15
