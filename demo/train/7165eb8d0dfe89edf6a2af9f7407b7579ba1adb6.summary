-- @entity2 dr. @entity1 : at a news conference in @entity6 , @entity7 , on tuesday , the renowned @entity4 scholar issued a fatwa -- a religious ruling -- condemning suicide bombers as destined for hell , removing extremists ' certainty of earning paradise after death			1
the 600 - page fatwa is arguably the most comprehensive theological refutation of @entity19 terrorism to date			1
@entity1 said his aim was to set an important precedent that might allow other scholars to similarly condemn the ideas behind terrorism			1
@entity6 's @entity34 newspaper reports that the imam told fellow @entity36 : " terrorism is terrorism , violence is violence and it has no place in @entity4 teaching and no justification can be provided for it , or any kind of excuses of ifs and buts			1
the world needs an absolute , unconditional , unqualified and total condemnation of terrorism			1
" according to his online biography , @entity1 was born in @entity40 in 1951 and was raised believing that he would become a religious leader , " since his birth had been foretold through a spiritual dream to his father			1
" the former law professor says he has written some 1,000 books , 360 of which are already in print			1
the @entity34 : @entity2 issues fatwa against all terrorists @entity52 : profile of dr. @entity1 @entity54 : the influential education historian , who served as assistant secretary of education under president @entity66 , " is in the final stages of an astonishing , slow motion about - face on almost every stand she once took on @entity63 schooling , " reports @entity55 in today 's @entity56			1
he writes that @entity54 is now criticizing approaches she once supported -- standardized testing , charter schools and free markets to improve schools -- as fads that undermine public education			1
she is critical of @entity74 legislation , saying it pushes essential subjects from classrooms			1
the @entity56 reports that she addressed a meeting of school superintendents last month in @entity81 , @entity82 , and pointed to the standards set by such countries as @entity85 and @entity86			1
she said , " they make sure that all their students study the arts , history , literature , geography , civics , foreign languages , the sciences and other subjects			2
they do this because this is the way to ensure good education			1
we 're on the wrong track			1
" @entity56 : scholar 's school reform u-turn shakes up debate @entity108 : the 80 - year - old former @entity109 , @entity110 , math teacher is fighting cancer , and @entity113 reports that his family members say they do n't have the money to pay all of his medical bills			1
the 1988 movie " @entity119 " tells @entity108 's inspirational story : when some call his students at @entity123 in @entity124 " unteachable , " @entity108 decides to teach them calculus			2
when all of his students pass a national advanced placement calculus exam , the testing company questions their high scores and invalidates some of them			2
when @entity108 protests and his students take the test again -- with one day of preparation -- they pass			2
actor @entity135 portrayed @entity108 , known affectionately as " @entity136 " in the movie , and now he 's raising money for him			2
on his web site , @entity135 writes , " the genius that he awakened in the ' unteachable ' commanded the attention of the entire world			2
it caused countless educators to reconsider what their students might really be capable of if , like @entity136 , they could awaken the ' ganas ' [ desire ] in them			2
@entity108 did n't just teach math. like all great teachers , he changed lives			2
gang members became aerospace engineers			2
kids who had spent their youth convinced their lives did n't matter discovered they were leaders			2
" @entity113 : ' @entity119 ' teacher battling cancer web site of @entity135 @entity161 : on march 2 , 2009 , the former @entity163 football player was rescued by the @entity164 from his overturned boat in the @entity166			2
he had gone fishing on two days before with another former @entity163 football player , @entity168 , 25 , and @entity171 players @entity169 , 26 , and @entity172 , 29			0
some 70 miles from shore , the boat flipped over			0
the men tried to support and save each other			0
in a book released this week , " not without @entity179 , " written with @entity56 sportswriter @entity178 , @entity161 tells the harrowing story : " we began to huddle together , cuddling almost , trying to stay warm as the night went on			0
i thought for a moment that it was weird , four grown men clustered together like puppies or kittens , but it was necessary if we were going to maintain any body heat			0
i could feel everybody shivering and hear their teeth chattering			0
once , when it was quiet , knowing how desperate our situation was , i said , ' i love you guys			0
' " all three of @entity195 's companions -- after fighting hypothermia and hallucinations -- died , but he writes that they all fought to stay alive			0
@entity198 : lone survivor of doomed fishing trip tells all @entity201 : " @entity202 was my boyfriend for a year and a half while we were both undergraduates at @entity205			1
i 've never spoken to the press about him ; i 'm not coming forward now for money or to advance any pathetic showbiz aspirations , but merely to stick up for a friend			0
" so writes @entity201 in a @entity211 exclusive essay			0
" this may surprise some people , but @entity202 was a great boyfriend			1
" she notes that she has n't seen @entity215 since the late ' 90s , but she remembers his " amazing metabolism " and all the time they spent eating together			1
@entity201 , 35 , grew up on an @entity219 reservation in @entity220 and is an advocate for @entity223 causes			0
she was the first person in her family to earn a college degree			1
" our relationship ended when @entity202 turned pro after his sophomore year , " she writes , " i was n't willing to give up my studies to follow him			1
like everyone else , i was shocked by the revelations about his infidelities			0
the @entity202 i knew was loyal , devoted and self - ­ controlled			1
" @entity201 also says that she and @entity202 " enjoyed a normal sexual relationship			1
" @entity236 : @entity202 's college girlfriend speaks out what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			1
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0

education historian changes mind , says @entity74 is wrong approach
@entity202 ' college girlfriend remembers him as " loyal , devoted and self - ­ controlled "
