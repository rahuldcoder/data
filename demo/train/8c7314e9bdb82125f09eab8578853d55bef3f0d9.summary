@entity0 -- if there 's been one consistent thread running through the @entity6 economic story since 2008 , it 's been the steady drumbeat of gloom			1
outright recession or sub-standard growth , stubbornly high unemployment and fiscal crises have been the topics du jour when it comes to the world 's biggest economy			1
but now an unlikely champion for @entity6 growth under the @entity20 administration has emerged -- a former adviser to a @entity23 presidential candidate and @entity25 history professor , @entity24 , who says @entity6 could actually be heading toward a new economic " golden age			1
" and it has nothing to do with @entity29 and everything to do with energy			2
@entity24 , who is also an author and commentator , believes the production of natural gas and oil from shale formations via a process known as " fracking " -- forcing open rocks by injecting fluid into cracks -- will be a game changer			1
" this is an absolutely huge phenomenon with massive implications for the @entity6 economy , and i think most people are still a little bit slow to appreciate just how big this is , " he said in @entity0 this week			2
" conceivably it does mean a new golden age			0
" @entity6 energy production has been booming in recent years			1
the @entity51 made a jaw - dropping forecast two weeks ago that the @entity6 would pass @entity52 as the world 's biggest oil producer by the end of this decade -- and would achieve near energy independence by the 2030s			1
that energy boom , asserts @entity24 , will create jobs in the @entity6			1
the energy sector currently supports 1.7 million @entity6 jobs directly or indirectly , according to economic forecaster @entity65 global insight			1
that could rise to 3 million by 2020 , it says			0
" it 's not only in the extraction industry and infrastructure , but more importantly cheap energy is going to create employment in manufacturing			0
i think you 'll see a renaissance in manufacturing , " said @entity24			0
" that is being helped by the fact @entity6 labor costs have been pretty competitive over the past decade , even as labor costs are going up in @entity82			2
" @entity83 drilling : from ' hell no ! ' to ... ' ok " it is also , he says , a big deal for the dollar			0
" as the @entity6 moves towards energy independence and becoming the biggest producer in the world , the dollar can only benefit			1
anybody who thought the financial crisis was going to lead to the demise of the dollar as an international currency is wrong -- it 's quite the opposite			0
" and what of @entity6 engagement in the @entity101 ? @entity24 says it would be naive to assume that @entity29 would withdraw in any significant way from the region			1
" nobody is going to step in and take the job of being global policeman in charge of @entity101 stability			0
i think everyone would be nervous , if the @entity82 suddenly volunteered to take that job on , which by the way they are not going to do anytime soon , " he said			0
protesters : @entity113 not worth the environmental risk for the recently reelected @entity6 president though , the energy boom looks like it could provide a welcome tailwind for his second term			2
it 's something that @entity24 acknowledges -- though one suspects through gritted teeth			2
as a supporter of @entity123 he penned a controversial pre-election cover story in @entity125 headlined " @entity126 , @entity127 , " which was highly critical of the president 's first term			0
he concedes the irony that the president will now be the beneficiary of the " good times that lie ahead			0
" opinion : oil and wildlife			0

historian @entity24 says @entity6 could be set for a new economic boom
says production of natural gas and oil from shale formations will have *enormous* implications
@entity51 : @entity6 to pass @entity52 as world 's biggest oil producer by end of decade
@entity51 says this could put @entity29 near energy independence within 20 years
