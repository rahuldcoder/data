samples collected from four patients who recently died have tested positive for enterovirus @entity2 , according to the @entity4			1
it is unclear what role the virus played in their deaths			0
in fact , it 's possible that enterovirus had nothing to do with them			2
the virus is very common , especially in the late summer and early fall , with the @entity4 estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the @entity17			2
yet the deaths do raise an alarm because this year has been worse than some other years , since enterovirus @entity20 has been sending more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses			1
it seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems			2
as of wednesday , the @entity4 had confirmed 500 people in 42 states have respiratory illnesses caused by enterovirus @entity2			1
those infected include @entity33 , a 10 - year - old from @entity35 , @entity36			1
she died september 22 at a @entity37 , according to her obituary , though it was n't until wednesday that the state @entity39 announced that she 'd tested positive for enterovirus @entity2			1
dr. @entity41 , @entity36 's @entity42 director , told reporters wednesday that the girl " died from overwhelming staphylococcus aureus sepsis			1
" @entity46 is a bacteria resistant to many antibiotics , while sepsis is an illness affecting all parts of the body that springs up in response to an infection , according to the @entity4			2
that determination notwithstanding , @entity41 also noted that " cultures also showed the presence of enterovirus @entity2			1
" he explained that the child , who was otherwise healthy , experienced shortness of breath " and really by the time she got to the hospital , everything fell apart very quickly within 24 hours			0
" @entity41 added that " it 's not clear what role the enterovirus had , but clearly ( this ) was a sepsis death			1
" " we do n't know which came first , and that 's not possible to know with the current state of our science , " the state health official said , referring to enterovirus and sepsis			1
@entity33 's classmates are n't being tested for enterovirus , in part because " this is an isolated case " and the virus itself is not uncommon or , usually , not much more harmful than a cold , according to @entity41			1
" we live in a world in which there are lots of viruses and lots of bacteria , " he added			0
" ... so the issue is n't always , ' how did that bacteria get to one person , ' but , ' what were the conditions under which the bacteria overgrew and took over and did ( all this ) so scathingly quickly ? ' " my son was like ' a goldfish gasping for breath ' @entity96 may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness seen in @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
doctors in @entity100 spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness , cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter			2
doctors at @entity112 have since identified four patients with the same symptoms			2
and a child in @entity117 , @entity102 , also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus , the @entity115 said wednesday			0
@entity46 is a type of bacteria that commonly causes skin infections , pneumonia and blood poisoning			0
most staph infections are easily treated with antibiotics , according to the @entity127 , but some strains of the bacteria are resistant to these medications , making them harder to treat			0
antibiotic - resistant infections has been a big public health issue the past few years			0
in september , president @entity132 signed an executive order establishing an interagency task force charged with developing a national strategy to combat these dangerous bacteria strains			0
the @entity36 @entity42 recommends parents and children follow these steps to prevention infection : -- wash hands often with soap and warm water five or six times a day for at least 20 seconds			1
-- avoid touching your eyes , nose and mouth with unwashed hands			0
-- make sure your child is taking asthma medications as prescribed			0
-- disinfect toys , doorknobs , phones , computers and other surfaces often			0
-- avoid close contact and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick			2
-- stay home if you are sick			0
-- seek medical attention right away if your child is having trouble breathing .			0
