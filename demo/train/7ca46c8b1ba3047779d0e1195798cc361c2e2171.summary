-- my mother , ms. @entity1 , was a woman of many talents			1
two in particular stand out			0
she was a superb cook ( the author of a successful cookbook ) , and she was an excellent bridge player			0
she always cautioned me that it was important that one " review the bidding " before the play			0
now that it 's becoming apparent that the efforts to cap the well at @entity14 are going to be successful , we should pause and pay homage to ms. @entity1 's advice by reviewing the bidding			2
any fair assessment would have to conclude that in spite of some people 's criticism of the early response , ( and by " some people " i mean ms. @entity1 's firstborn son @entity26 ) , one also must give credit to a much improved and vigorous response to the environmental catastrophe in the @entity30			1
so , let 's review the bidding : first , the decision to keep the unflappable retired @entity35 adm. @entity34 in place as national incident commander , in spite of considerable opposition from some local politicians , has proven to be wise			2
second , when attorney general @entity42 announced a criminal investigation into the @entity45 disaster , it was a demonstration that the @entity47 administration meant business in dealing with this catastrophe			1
third , the establishment of the $ 20 billion restitution fund administered by @entity52 was the ultimate statement of the seriousness with which this situation was being addressed by the administration			1
fourth , people who have deep knowledge of the events in the @entity30 give substantial credit to energy secretary @entity60 and other experts from government labs who were brought in to assist with the successful capping of the well			0
we in the @entity69 , in particular those of us in @entity67 , have a long way to go			0
we need our government to remain vigilant in addressing this			2
we need a lot of research into the science of the effects of the spill			0
and in the words of interior secretary @entity79 , we need to continue to have the heel of our boot on the neck of @entity45			2
all of us in the region need to stay vigilant and aggressive in being sure that the inevitable " it 's time to move on " mentality does not set in			1
the last thing we need to do is move on until our precious coastline is both restored and renewed			0
i do n't know many people -- and no @entity90 -- who were as tough on the @entity47 administration as i was when the oil started gushing			1
but for now i 'll take @entity95 governor -- and chairman of the @entity97 -- @entity98 saying president @entity47 has " done more right than wrong			1
" in fact , i 'll up gov. @entity98 's bid one and say that as of late , president @entity47 has done a lot more right than wrong			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity104			0

@entity104 was critical of the *federal* government 's early handling of the oil disaster
he says it now is clear president @entity47 handled a tough situation very well
he credits @entity47 for putting @entity34 in charge , setting up @entity45 restitution fund , other steps
@entity1 : " all of us in the region need to stay vigilant and aggressive "
