-- the drought of 2012 will be one that farmers and ranchers remember for years to come			1
my husband , @entity7 , and i are fifth - generation farmers			0
this is the first drought we have experienced since we were married and started farming together in 1995			2
our farm , like most other @entity13 farms , is really suffering right now and in desperate need of rain			1
the media have pegged it right : it definitely is the worst drought of our generation			2
@entity7 and i own and raise hogs , cattle , corn , soybeans and alfalfa hay on our farm			1
typically , we do n't have a lot of crops to farm , but this year we decided to rent an extra 200 acres for that purpose , doubling our row - crop acreage			1
we were able to purchase crop insurance for most of our crops , but unfortunately that alone will not help make our farm or equipment payments to the bank since most of our crops are ruined			1
our crop failure is n't what keeps me awake at night these days ; it 's worrying about our animals			1
no crops means no feed for livestock			1
we ca n't stop feeding cattle and hogs			0
we own 60 head of cattle , and our family has 1,500 sows on our farm			2
@entity50 crops are needed for an adequate feed supply , but so too are healthy pastures for cattle grazing			2
hogs eat mostly corn and soybeans because they are not ruminant animals , which means they do not have four stomach chambers like cattle , which can digest hay and grass			2
the price to purchase corn and soybeans is skyrocketing because of crop losses across most of the @entity13			1
unlike crop farmers , livestock farmers and ranchers do not have insurance programs to ease the losses during disaster years			1
when our feed costs get out of control , or when a disease devastates our herd , there is no relief from insurance			2
this is a total loss for farmers and ranchers			0
to pay the bills , we have to go to the bank and borrow more money to help us survive the storm			0
this means yet another loan payment			2
when my expenses increase on our farm , it would be nice to tell the packer who buys my hogs that i need to be paid more so i can make ends meet			2
but it does n't work that way			0
hogs feel drought 's pinch we are price takers ; supply and demand drive the price we are paid for hogs			1
even though my feed bills are increasing at alarming rates , right now it does n't mean that pork demand has increased in line with my expenses			1
farmers have to wait for an increase in demand , or decrease in supply , to see their prices increase			0
i have been asked before why i just do n't hold on to our hogs and wait for someone to pay me what i need to pay my feed bills			0
this is because packers only accept a certain weight so they can meet consumer demand			0
consumers want a consistent size piece of pork -- not too big or too small -- and they want their chops to look the same each time they go to the store			0
to meet this demand , farmers ca n't sell hogs that are overweight or underweight			0
the pain of this drought does n't stop with farmers and ranchers			0
everyone has a vested interest in how @entity136 is behaving			0
food availability will be affected because farmers will be producing less food			1
in the end , this will lead to increased food prices			1
a number of livestock farmers and ranchers will be faced with difficult decisions			0
some will be forced to leave the farm or ranch and find new jobs in neighboring towns , while others may have to sell their family farm or ranch			0
the bottom line is : if you eat , this drought will affect you			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1

@entity158 's farm has been badly affected by the drought
she says the bill to feed her livestock is increasing fast because of crop losses
@entity158 : the drought means taking on more debt and *possibly* selling off livestock
the drought will change lives on farms and will raise food prices for all , she says
