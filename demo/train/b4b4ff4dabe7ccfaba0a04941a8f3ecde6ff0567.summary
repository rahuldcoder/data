@entity0 , @entity1 -- feared lost forever , 20 ancient ivory artifacts looted from @entity5 's national museum were presented to the country 's president , @entity6 , in @entity0 tuesday			1
the 2,000 - year - old artifacts are the latest additions to the internationally acclaimed exhibition " @entity5 : @entity11 , " which starts its @entity14 run at the @entity15 this week			1
stolen during @entity5 's civil war between 1992 and 1994 , the ivory inlays were once part of a hoard of treasures found at the ancient city of @entity22 , north of modern - day @entity23			1
" these are an extraordinary set of ivories , " said @entity25 , director of the @entity15			0
" stolen from the @entity29 in @entity23 , bought by a @entity0 dealer specifically to return them , restored by conservators at the @entity15 ... and after the exhibition they will go back			2
" originally part of a set of @entity38 furniture owned by the @entity40 rulers from the 1st century @entity41 , the ivories were first discovered by a @entity43 archaeologist in 1937			0
found in a concealed room in the ruins of @entity22 's ancient palace , it 's believed the treasures were hidden in a moment of crisis			0
they then lay forgotten for almost 2,000 years			0
the artifacts have now been given back to the @entity29 of @entity5 thanks to a philanthropic donor who bought the ivories from various black market dealers			1
" ( he 's ) retrieved what is probably the largest single group of antiquities that were known to be looted from the national museum during the civil war , " said exhibition curator , @entity57			1
" it shows what an important role the international community can play in recovering material that has been stolen and has been sold and can then be returned , " added @entity25			0
according to the @entity15 , it 's estimated around 70 % of the artifacts once found in @entity5 's national museum have been looted or destroyed over the past 30 years			1
often the only way these precious relics are recovered is through international border agencies working in collaboration with museums and archaeological experts			0
so far , the @entity14 has sent back one crate of seized artifacts to @entity5 , with another shipment due to go back in the near future			2
the rest of the exhibition 's 200 relics , spanning 4,000 years of the country 's ancient history , are only with us today thanks to the actions of a few dedicated individuals			2
they were hidden on the eve of the @entity93 invasion in 1979 by a handful of @entity5 and lay undiscovered in vaults underneath @entity5 's presidential palace for over thirty years			1
now they are part of this traveling exhibition , which raises awareness and much - needed funds for the national museum in @entity23			2
" although we use these cliche terms for marketing purposes , these objects really do sing , " said @entity103			0
" they show the fragility of cultural heritage and how the @entity5 who saved them for the world have done such a fantastic job raising cultural awareness and showing there is much more to @entity5 then the cliched news clips that you normally hear or see			0
