-- next tuesday and wednesday , the nine justices of the @entity3 @entity2 will hear arguments on two momentous cases			1
in one , the court will be asked to decide whether same - sex couples have a right to marry in @entity9 despite the passage of a referendum against it			1
in the other , the parties will argue over the @entity14 , which , among other things , makes it legal to deny @entity17 , pension and tax benefits to gay and lesbian couples			0
where do you stand on these issues ? @entity25 on wednesday begins a special series of pieces on the topic			2
we 're inviting you to examine your own views and to see which states have laws corresponding to your stances			2
our columns over the next several days will include pieces by @entity36 , who finds that @entity3 has a state - by - state patchwork of rules on marriage , employment and legal protections applying to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender @entity3 and calls for changes			2
other writers will argue against many of those changes , in accompanying opinion pieces			0
the cases before the @entity2 proceed against the backdrop of rapidly shifting views over the rights extended to @entity54 @entity3			1
in 2008 , a @entity0 poll found that 53 % of @entity3 believed marriages between gay and lesbian couples should not be recognized by the law as valid			0
last year , a similar @entity0 poll found that 54 % now favor such marriages			0
in 1998 , 51 % of @entity3 said someone who is homosexual could change their sexual orientation			0
by last may , 34 % held that view			0
opinion : gay marriage , then group marriage ? president @entity68 , who said during his 2008 campaign that marriage was " between a man and a woman , " in may declared his support for same - sex marriage , and the administration has now put its weight behind supporters of gay marriage before the @entity2			1
in that case , two lawyers who argued opposite sides of the landmark 2000 @entity80 case , which decided that presidential election , @entity83 @entity82 and @entity85 @entity84 , are united in pushing for legal recognition of same - sex marriage			1
prominent @entity94 attorney @entity93 will lead the defense of @entity96 , the @entity9 referendum against same - sex marriage			1
but while same - sex marriage grabs the headlines , there are many other issues relating to gay rights			1
should states prohibit people from being fired because of their sexual orientation ? a majority of them do not , according to the @entity108			0
listen : voices from the @entity111 closet should public school teachers be allowed to talk in class about homosexuality ? should states ban gays from adopting children ? all of these questions can be explored in the interactive calculator @entity0 created to help shed light on the difference in legal protections among the 50 states			1
the calculator enables you to enter your own views and find out which states correspond most closely			2
we hope this coverage will prompt debate , and we look forward to hearing what you think .			0
