-- @entity1 appears set to recognize same - sex marriages on january 6 , after the @entity4 @entity3 on friday declined to further delay a lower court 's finding that the state 's ban on the unions is unconstitutional			1
the high court friday night , without explanation , rejected the @entity1 attorney general 's request to intervene			1
a @entity4 district judge in @entity1 had ruled in august the state 's ban was unconstitutional but stayed the ruling to allow for appeals			1
the case has n't been completely settled			0
neither the 11th @entity20 nor the @entity3 have ruled on the merits , and @entity1 attorney general @entity22 , who has defended the ban , has expressed " confusion " over whether all 67 counties will issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples before appeals are settled			1
but the @entity28 of @entity1 said it expects the state to fully recognize same - sex marriages when @entity4 district judge @entity32 's stay expires at the end of january 5			1
" this is a thrilling day for all @entity1 families			1
as we explained to the court , every day that the ban remains in place , couples are suffering real harms , " @entity28 of @entity1 attorney @entity35 said			1
" we are grateful that the court recognized that , and that as a result , those days are finally coming to an end			0
" @entity1 would become the 36th state to recognize same - sex marriage , in addition to the @entity49			0
in august , @entity32 ruled the @entity1 ban -- first put into law in 1977 and written into the state 's constitution after a 2008 referendum -- violates the " due process " and " equal protection " provisions in the @entity4 @entity57 's 14th amendment			1
his ruling applied to whether same - sex couples can marry in @entity1 as well as to whether such marriages elsewhere should be recognized in the @entity1			0
as part of the ruling , @entity32 ordered that @entity65 , @entity1 , must issue a marriage license to two plaintiffs -- a same - sex couple -- who sued the state			2
he then stayed his own ruling , saying some time needed to pass to allow higher courts to reverse his decision			0
@entity22 filed an appeal with the 11th circuit			0
that court has yet to hear , or schedule a hearing on , arguments on the merits			0
both @entity32 and the @entity80 declined this fall to extend the stay			0
on monday , @entity22 asked the high court to extend the delay until the state exhausted its appeals			2
" the public is not served by on - again , off - again marriage laws , " her office argued in this week 's application			0
after the @entity3 declined to intervene , @entity22 issued a statement acknowledging january 5 as the stay 's final day			1
but , earlier this week , she said that there would be " confusion about the effect of ( @entity32 's ruling ) , which is directed to only one of @entity1 's 67 clerks of court			1
" @entity22 's statement did n't directly address her earlier county concerns			0
a @entity102 spokeswoman did not immediately respond to @entity0 's request for comment saturday on whether all 67 counties must issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples once @entity32 's stay expires			2
@entity35 , the @entity28 of @entity1 attorney , indicated that he expects they will			1
" we expect public officials in all of @entity1 's 67 counties to understand the significance of this development and look forward to full implementation of judge @entity32 's decision across our state , " @entity35 said			2
@entity4 district and circuit courts overturned many states ' same - sex marriage bans after the @entity3 rejected parts of the federal @entity124 in 2013			0
one federal appeals court -- the @entity125 -- upheld bans in @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 in november , a move that could force the @entity3 to take up the issue			2
@entity0 's @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this report .			0
