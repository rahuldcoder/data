remember the @entity1 targeting of conservative groups ? @entity1 targeting : scandal or snafu ? it was the scandal du jour in @entity6 last month , now relegated to back - burner status after recent revelations of a vast government electronic surveillance apparatus created in the name of national security following the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
@entity13 : leaks damaged @entity16 security the announcement thursday by the @entity19 administration that it would boost aid to @entity22 rebels because government forces there used chemical weapons further shifted attention away from the @entity1 controversy involving extra scrutiny given conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status			1
@entity31 continue trying to raise the issue , grilling fbi director @entity33 about it at a congressional hearing on thursday			1
they argue that the @entity19 administration used the tax agency to intimidate and harass political opponents			1
@entity38 respond that the independent inspector general who revealed the targeting blamed poor management , rather than political bias			0
congressional sources on both sides say that interviews with @entity1 workers so far have found no political conspiracy			2
read @entity1 watchdog 's report what happens next depends on any further information from ongoing investigations			1
the @entity1 , the agency 's inspector general at the @entity56 , @entity57 , the @entity58 and @entity31 - led congressional committees are all looking into the matter			1
acting @entity1 commissioner @entity60 , appointed by president @entity19 to clean up the mess , said last week that he would release more information on the targeting once privacy issues had been worked out			1
new @entity1 chief asks for patience over targeting probe if the investigations fail to find a political effort to suppress activities by conservatives , the scandal will likely die a slow bureaucratic death of piecemeal reports in coming months			1
however , if the multiple inquiries find evidence of guidance from @entity6 and even the @entity79 , as claimed by @entity31 , the scandal would instantly generate new headlines , more hearings and possible criminal proceedings			1
@entity83 claims revealing memo exists in @entity1 scandal @entity33 told the @entity90 on thursday 's the @entity91 was investigating @entity1 targeting , and assured legislators that " to the extent there 's any indication of criminal misconduct , we will follow the leads and the evidence wherever it takes us			1
" however , he declined to discuss the matter further because of the ongoing probe , prompting frustration from @entity31 on the panel			2
conservative rep. @entity103 , a fierce critic of the @entity19 administration , hammered @entity33 with questions such as who was leading the investigation , how many investigators were assigned and whether they had interviewed groups victimized by the targeting			1
when @entity33 said he had n't been briefed on those details , the @entity110 @entity31 blew up			2
" you ca n't even tell me who the lead investigator is ? " he asked @entity112 , who will step down soon after almost 12 years leading the @entity91			0
" you ca n't tell me how many agents are assigned to the most important story in the country ? " seven committee hearings so far on the matter revealed the partisan divide that permeates @entity6			0
republicans called the targeting a conspiracy of nixonian dimensions , while @entity38 condemned it as bureaucratic rather than political malfeasance			0
at the @entity134 , @entity31 chairman @entity129 of @entity130 and ranking @entity132 @entity131 of @entity133 have engaged in a public dispute over interviews that panel investigators conducted with @entity1 workers involved in the targeting			1
earlier this month , @entity129 released excerpts of transcripts that he said showed @entity1 officials in @entity6 played a role in the targeting			1
" this was a problem coordinated in all likelihood right out of @entity6 headquarters and we 're getting to proving it , " he told @entity145 on june 2			0
@entity129 : @entity153 @entity1 employees say direction came from @entity6 " my gut tells me that too many people knew this wrongdoing was going on before the election , and at least by some sort of convenient , benign neglect , allowed it to go on through the election , " @entity129 said			2
" i 'm not making any allegations as to motive , that they set out to do it , but certainly people knew it was happening			0
" in response , the @entity134 's @entity38 staff released further interview excerpts that @entity131 said disproved any @entity79 role			2
he challenged @entity129 to release the full transcript , which has yet to occur			0
" based upon everything i 've seen , the case is solved , " @entity131 told @entity145 last sunday			0
" and if it were me , i would wrap this case up and move on			0
" @entity131 : ' conservative ' refutes @entity1 - @entity79 story meanwhile , the @entity79 has tried to shift attention to other issues with events on student loan rates , health care reform and immigration legislation			2
second term mostly drama for @entity19 @entity31 resists @entity79 effort to control message top @entity79 officials say they knew nothing of the targeting when it occurred			1
general counsel @entity192 learned of a pending inspector general 's report on april 24 , 2013 , according to @entity79 spokesman @entity195			0
when asked wednesday if the full transcripts of interviews with @entity1 workers should be released , @entity195 said @entity129 had promised to do so			0
he added that @entity131 " has demonstrated that we have seen yet again some cherry - picking when it comes to the release of testimony , release of information , " @entity195 added , referring to past instances when @entity31 on the oversight panel made public details on other issues that turned out to be incomplete or misleading			2
the inspector general report last month found that an @entity1 unit in @entity153 had used criteria that included conservative labels such as " tea party " to target groups seeking tax - exempt status for extra questioning			2
@entity1 rules prevent groups engaging in political activity from becoming tax exempt			0
according to the report , the targeting began in 2010 and ended last year when senior @entity1 officials learned of it			2
it blamed a misguided effort to streamline handling of increased applications for tax - exempt status , exacerbated by unclear regulations regarding what constitutes political activity			0
@entity31 contend the targeting was political discrimination in the run - up to the 2012 election , and one of the @entity31 - led @entity79 committees heard from groups who detailed delayed handling of their requests , excessive questioning by the @entity1 for inappropriate information , and other problems			1
some conservatives also contend they faced @entity1 tax audits due to political targeting , but no evidence of such activity has turned up in investigations so far			1
@entity57 told an earlier congressional hearing that his unit was investigating the possible use of other lists of criteria to trigger additional scrutiny of tax - exempt applications			0
meanwhile , the partisan bickering goes on			0
the @entity258 released a video this week that accused the @entity19 administration of dodging responsibility			1
it included footage of @entity1 officials testifying before congressional committees , edited to highlight when they said they did n't know or were unable to remember details			0
@entity31 video keeps up pressure over @entity1 targeting " @entity16 deserve answers to why their first amendment rights were so egregiously violated , " @entity258 chairman @entity271 said			1
" turning a blind eye and claiming not to know , or remember , what actions were carried out is no excuse for targeting individuals based on their beliefs			0
these are simple questions , and if they ca n't answer it raises another : what are they hiding ? "			0

multiple investigations of the @entity1 targeting continue
disclosure of @entity16 surveillance *programs* has *diminished* focus on @entity1 issue
@entity31 continue raising the @entity1 targeting in criticizing the @entity19 administration
