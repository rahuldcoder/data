@entity0 -- for more than a year , @entity2 has been the elephant in the room in @entity6 politics -- the central figure in one of the messiest political scandals to hit the ruling @entity10 in years			1
sacked as party chief in the sprawling metropolis of @entity20 in march last year for " serious disciplinary violations , " the former member of the party 's powerful 25 - member @entity17 has now been indicted for bribery , corruption and abuse of power , the state - run @entity12 news agency reported thursday			1
the 64 year old has been in detention since april 2012			1
the indictment paper was delivered to a court in @entity29 in the eastern province of @entity31 , @entity12 said , and paves the way for what will be the most eagerly anticipated trial in @entity6 in recent years -- an incredible story of elite politics , murder , intrigue and betrayal			0
according to the document , @entity2 , as a civil servant , took advantage of his position to seek profits for others and accepted an " extremely large amount " of money and properties in return			2
he also embezzled a huge amount of public money and abused his power , seriously harming the interests of the state and the people			0
the document added that @entity2 has been informed of his legal rights and interviewed by prosecutors			2
political star @entity2 is a @entity10 " princeling			2
" his father was a contemporary of chairman @entity62 and @entity63 , and until recently @entity2 was a rising star in @entity6 political circles			2
a charismatic and urbane politician , he was credited with a spectacular -- albeit brutal -- crackdown on organized crime in @entity20 's massive municipality of around 30 million people			1
from june 2009 , @entity2 led a law and order campaign that resulted in the arrest of thousands of suspected gangsters , but critics claim it also targeted his political adversaries			2
his economic policies , which included millions spent on social housing , garnered him rock star status in @entity20 -- a fact that did not go down well with other members of the party hierarchy			1
his populist policies and high - profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform - oriented faction within the party			0
wife woes but when his deputy , @entity90 , walked into the @entity92 consulate in the city of @entity94 in february last year and told @entity92 diplomats that @entity2 's wife , @entity96 , was an accomplice in a murder case , a glittering political career began to unravel			1
in a turn of events worthy of a movie script , @entity96 and family aide @entity98 were arrested in early april , suspected of poisoning @entity103 businessman and family friend @entity104 , who died at a @entity20 hotel in november 2011			1
@entity104 's death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption , but prosecutors claimed @entity96 and @entity104 , who had been invited to @entity20 from @entity110 , drank alcohol and tea in the hotel room , after which the businessman got drunk and began vomiting , a prosecutor said			1
when @entity104 asked for water , @entity96 asked @entity98 , who 'd been waiting outside , to come into the room			0
it was then that @entity96 got cyanide from @entity98 and , after her aide carried @entity104 to the bed , poured the poison into the @entity124 's mouth , according to the prosecutor			0
@entity127 's confession at his own trial for abuses of power in september last year , @entity90 -- who was @entity20 's police chief -- was accused by prosecutors of knowing " perfectly well " that @entity96 was suspected of murder			1
they said he deliberately covered up for her so she would not be held legally responsible for @entity104 's death			0
the court was then told that when relations between @entity90 and @entity96 began to break down over the issue , @entity90 told " the then leading official of the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) @entity139 " -- the position @entity2 held -- that @entity96 was " highly suspected " of having murdered @entity104 , @entity12 said			1
a witness , @entity141 , testified that the official " angrily rebuked " @entity90 , before slapping him in the face			0
" the conflict was made public after @entity90 was slapped , " @entity141 said			0
after @entity90 's run - in with @entity2 , he instructed his staff to " rearrange " @entity104 's case file			1
shortly after , he was demoted and three members working closely with @entity90 were put under " illegal investigation			0
" " @entity90 felt he was in danger , giving rise to his idea to defect , " @entity12 said			2
at the close of the trial , @entity90 's defense team pleaded for leniency in sentencing on the defection charge on the grounds that @entity90 left the @entity92 consulate of his own volition			2
they also said he provided key evidence to help authorities secure @entity96 's conviction for murder and on that basis his crime of bending the law for personal gain " could be lighter			0
" the court accepted these arguments and sentenced him to 15 years in prison			0
during her trial the previous month , after which she received a suspended death sentence , @entity96 admitted poisoning @entity104 , blaming a " mental breakdown " for her actions after learning that her son , @entity176 , was in jeopardy			0
according to @entity12 , @entity104 allegedly threatened him following a botched business deal			0
though @entity2 has yet to comment publicly on his wife 's case or @entity90 's accusations , @entity1 recently spoke to a @entity2 family friend who revealed that a family - appointed lawyer had spoken to the disgraced politician several times since late last year			1
during those meetings , @entity2 's spirits were said to be high			1
the lawyer claimed @entity2 denies government allegations against him and wants an " open trial and the opportunity to defend himself during that process			0
" timeline : @entity2 's fall from grace @entity1 's @entity197 and @entity198 in @entity110 and @entity199 in @entity200 contributed to this report .			1
