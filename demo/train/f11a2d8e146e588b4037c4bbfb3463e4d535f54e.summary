editor 's note : @entity2 is a staff attorney at the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5			1
before joining the organization , she spent two years as an attorney at @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11 , and also was a law clerk to @entity14 district judge @entity13 in the @entity15			0
@entity2 says justice was n't done in the trial of two charged in the death of @entity19			1
( @entity20 ) -- on july 14 , 2008 , 25 - year old @entity19 , a father of two , died after being brutally beaten by a group of @entity22 , @entity23 , high school football players who yelled racial epithets throughout the beating			1
during the week of april 27 , a @entity28 jury heard the criminal case against two of the four assailants , @entity30 and @entity32 , including charges of homicide , ethnic intimidation , aggravated assault and hindering prosecution			1
the jury heard overwhelming evidence describing how @entity19 was twice knocked to the ground , surrounded , kicked and stomped on by the football players			1
according to witnesses , the attack ended after @entity30 kicked @entity19 in the head as he lay still on the pavement , causing him to convulse and foam at the mouth			2
medical experts testified that the kick to the head fractured @entity19 's skull and resulted in such extreme swelling of the brain that his skull could not contain it			2
undisputed evidence explained that the assailants met on the following day to fabricate a cover - up story			0
despite the overwhelming evidence of the violent , racially motivated attack , the jury found the two defendants guilty of only a misdemeanor -- simple assault			0
the flagrant injustice resulting from the verdicts has once again shed light on both the wave of hate crimes against @entity68 as well as the failure of our judicial system consistently to administer justice fairly without regard to race			0
in this case , @entity19 was not only the victim of a heinous , racially motivated crime but also of a prejudiced local judicial process			1
since the verdict , the jury foreman has courageously come forward to express his sentiment that racism contaminated the jury 's deliberations			0
although he said did not believe enough evidence was presented to overcome the reasonable doubt in his mind , the jury foreman stated that he believed some of the jurors already had predetermined the results before their deliberations			0
the possibility that the integrity of the jury 's deliberations was compromised is not unlikely given the development of the case and the defense attorneys ' dogged strategy to appeal to the jurors ' prejudices and fears			0
for example , the defense made a large issue of the fact that a @entity107 acquaintance of @entity19 's appeared at the scene after the beating was over with a bb gun , and that the acquaintance had an inconsequential encounter with the defendants as they were fleeing the crime scene			1
since the bb gun appeared as the defendants were fleeing , it could not possibly have had any relevance to , or bearing on , the defendants ' actions for which they were tried , yet the defense attorney made it a point to show the weapon to the jury three times in an effort to associate @entity19 with a criminal element			1
the jury , which was selected in one day , heard the defense attorneys characterize the defendants as " boys " and " kids " who felt threatened by and had to defend against @entity19			1
by allowing the introduction of irrelevant , unduly prejudicial evidence , the court permitted the defense throughout the trial to demonize @entity19 in contrast to its efforts to humanize and garner sympathy for the accused			2
while the evidence and testimony presented to criminalize @entity19 had absolutely no relation to the underlying brutal acts committed by the defendants , they had everything to do with appealing to the jurors ' prejudices against the @entity154 " illegal " immigrant			1
no one , not even the prosecution , bothered to emphasize that @entity19 was a real person -- a father of two young children , partner , son and brother			2
common sense dictates that four star football players were unlikely to have been threatened by @entity19 , and one of them so testified when he stated that he was not scared of @entity19 because he " was smaller " and they outnumbered him by six to one			2
yet it seems prejudice overruled reason in this case , and that the life of a @entity154 immigrant who was fatally beaten by white " kids " was deemed subhuman			2
indeed , after the verdicts were read , the disregard for the taking of @entity19 's life was again pronounced by the jubilant cheers and applause from the defendants ' families and friends that were more fitting for a football game victory than an acquittal from serious criminal charges in the brutal beating and death of another human being			1
what is equally disturbing is the message the verdicts carry -- that @entity107 immigrants can be brutally beaten without any consequence to those who commit the crimes			0
in the wake of the @entity197 immigrant campaign that has raged over the last several years , hate crimes against @entity68 across our nation have surged by 40 percent from 2003 to 2007 , according to @entity199 statistics			0
the anti-immigrant rhetoric spewed by irresponsible politicians and media personalities has penetrated our households , schools and entire communities			0
we must be vigilant to expose and challenge this xenophobia wherever we see it			0
racial hatred is not only a threat to the fabric of our society but can have dangerous , deadly consequences			0
unfortunately , as a result of the verdicts in this case , the @entity107 community in @entity22 and throughout our country now stands even more vulnerable to similar hate - filled crimes			1
this travesty of justice is a sobering moment for our country , as we are forced as a nation again to face the disturbing fact that racism and xenophobia continue to seep into the hearts and minds of @entity14			0
the glaring injustice in the case of @entity19 behooves all compassionate and fair - minded people to stand up against it			1
in fact , it is quite encouraging that people of all backgrounds from throughout the country , including the @entity22 area , have expressed their own outrage at the verdicts and have joined the @entity3 's call for justice for @entity19			1
a federal prosecution is in the public interest to eradicate bias - motivated violence and to secure substantial justice in this case			0
the @entity246 has initiated an investigation , and we urge it to move forward with federal civil rights charges to provide justice for the death of @entity19 and for our national interest			1
we must not allow bigotry and hate to define our own reactions to this injustice			0
rather , we must respond firmly and proactively by uniting across communities to condemn these actions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity19 was beaten to death in @entity22 , @entity23
@entity2 says acquittal of two defendants on most charges was an injustice
@entity268 : @entity246 should bring charges in the case
