in some ways , it 's just a number , but it 's a big number with enormous implications			2
for the first time , scientists measured an average concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide of 400 parts per million in @entity8 , @entity9 , where the @entity11 observatory is located , on thursday			1
" most experts that really study @entity19 amounts estimate that we have n't seen that amount of co2 in our atmosphere in about 3 million years , " said @entity12 , climate change expert and professor at the @entity15			2
in other words , modern humans have never seen carbon dioxide in these proportions before			1
scientists say it 's apparent that human activity -- namely burning coal , oil and natural gas -- has been driving a rapid rise of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere			1
carbon dioxide changes climate and drives acidification of the ocean			1
" once emitted , it remains for the ocean atmosphere system for thousands of years , warming the planet			2
it changes climate and is driving ocean acidification all that time , " said @entity44 , a senior scientist at @entity11			1
among the many risks of rising temperatures , agriculture , forestry , ecosystems and human health are all expected to suffer as a result of trends in climate change			2
turbulence ahead as climate changes the amount of carbon dioxide varies daily somewhat and has cycled historically in accordance with changes in the @entity63 's orbit , a phenomenon known as @entity66 cycles			1
but the exponential rise in carbon dioxide levels since the @entity70 is far out of the ordinary , experts say			1
the number 400 parts per million is symbolic of what many scientists believe to be the inevitable growth of this gas in our atmosphere , @entity12 said			2
getting to this number was to be expected			2
" it also is kind of a warning sign or red flag that hey , we really need to tackle this problem , " he said			1
" it 's happening right before our eyes			2
" in about eight to 10 years , levels will not go under 400 parts per million , @entity44 said			0
and in terms of reaching new carbon dioxide highs , 450 will come even faster than than the change from 350 to 400 , given observed trends , @entity12 said			1
for comparison , the last time annual @entity19 was 350 parts per million was in the 1980s			0
@entity96 likens the phenomenon to an electric blanket			0
when you turn the dial , it takes a little while to warm up			0
it 's as if humans have turned the dial on @entity63 's blanket , and we 'll feel the heat only in a matter of time			0
" even if we stopped emitting @entity19 , temperatures would still rise for at least a decade or two because the system has to catch up with it , " @entity44 said			0
most carbon dioxide is in the @entity115 , because most people on the planet live in these parts , @entity44 said			1
in 2012 , monitoring stations in the @entity120 measured 400 parts per million , but this is a new high at @entity8			0
the global average will catch up in a year or two , he said			0
since scientists began measuring at @entity8 in 1958 , the concentration of carbon dioxide has been increasing every year , @entity11 said			1
the rate of this rise has been accelerating , from 0.7 ppm per year in the late 1950s to 2.1 ppm per year over the last decade			0
before the 19th - century @entity70 , the average carbon dioxide concentration worldwide was about 280 parts per million			1
over the course of the past 800,000 years , says @entity11 , these levels bounced between 180 and 280 parts per million			0
@entity11 : watch history of carbon dioxide levels you might be wondering how the planet could be warming if this past winter has been relatively cool			1
@entity12 explains that weather is akin to mood , but climate is analogous to personality			0
weather changes a lot , but climate is something more fundamental , causing overall patterns			0
study : climate change may contribute to civil wars it may appear that , in the grand scheme of things , there 's not a lot of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to begin with			1
the most abundant gas is nitrogen , at 78 % , followed by oxygen at 21 %			0
having a tiny amount of carbon dioxide is essential for our survival ; without it , the planet would be too cold			1
opinion : how to fight climate change but too much carbon dioxide , which leads to too much overall warming , is bad			1
while it 's impossible to say that any particular event was " caused by global warming , " says @entity12 , climate change loads the deck , making extreme events such as last year 's @entity176 more likely			2
these storms also become more disastrous with rising sea levels			0
the sea level near @entity180 was about 10 inches higher in 2012 than in 1900 , @entity12 said			0
the @entity8 station is the oldest in the world to measure carbon dioxide			1
" it 's an alarming marker that we 've passed , " @entity44 said			0
" @entity8 , the iconic site for @entity19 , has reached 400 for the first time over a day			0
" more science and space news from @entity192 @entity191			0

carbon dioxide levels have reached historic high at @entity9 observatory
carbon dioxide changes climate and drives acidification of the ocean , experts say
scientists expected this carbon dioxide level but say it 's a warning sign
