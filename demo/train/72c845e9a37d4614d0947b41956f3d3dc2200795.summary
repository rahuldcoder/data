-- having a disease named after you is a decidedly mixed bag			2
on the one hand , your scientific developments are forever commemorated			0
on the other hand , though , you 're stuck with the knowledge that no patient will ever be happy upon hearing your name			0
who are the scientists and doctors behind some of our most famous diseases and conditions , though ? here are a few of the physicians and their eponymous ailments : 1			2
@entity21 's disease the inflammatory digestive disease could just have easily ended up with the name @entity24 's disease or @entity27 's disease			1
in 1932 , three @entity29 physicians named @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32 published a paper describing a new sort of intestinal inflammation			0
since @entity21 's name was listed first alphabetically , the condition ended up bearing his name			1
salmonellosis yes , the salmonella menace that haunts undercooked chicken is named after a person			0
@entity43 was a veterinary pathologist who ran a @entity45 microorganism research program during the late 19th century			0
although @entity43 did n't actually discover the type of bacterium that now bears his name -- famed epidemiologist @entity46 isolated the bacteria in 1885 -- he ran the research program in which the discovery occurred			0
@entity46 and his colleagues named the bacteria salmonella in honor of their boss			0
@entity0 : @entity57 , other foods named after people 3			1
@entity61 's disease @entity61 was a busy fellow			1
while the @entity63 apothecary had a booming medical business , he also dabbled in geology , paleontology , and politics ; @entity61 even published a three - volume scientific study of fossils			2
following a late - 18th - century foray into @entity72 politics where he advocated a number of social causes and found himself briefly ensnared in an alleged plot to assassinate @entity76 , @entity61 turned his attention to medicine			0
@entity61 did some research on gout and peritonitis , but it was his landmark 1817 study " an essay on the @entity84 " that affixed his name to @entity84			2
@entity87 's disease @entity88 was n't the most prolific researcher , but he made his papers count			1
in 1872 , a fresh - out - of - med - school @entity88 published one of two research papers he would write in his life			0
in the paper , @entity88 described the effects of the neurodegenerative disorder that now bears his name after examining several generations of family that all suffered from the genetic condition			0
@entity102 's disease in 1901 , @entity103 neuropathologist @entity102 began observing an odd patient at a @entity106 asylum			1
the 51 - year - old woman , mrs. @entity107 , had no short - term memory and behaved strangely			0
when mrs. @entity107 died in 1906 , @entity102 began to dissect the patient 's brain , and he presented his findings that november in what was the first formal description of presenile dementia			1
@entity0 : 4 people with super memory 6			2
tourette syndrome credit @entity118 for his modesty			2
when the @entity122 neurologist first described the illness that now bears his name in 1884 , he did n't name it after himself			0
instead , he referred to the condition as " maladie des tics			0
" @entity118 's mentor and contemporary @entity128 renamed the illness after @entity118			2
@entity118 did n't have such great luck with patients , though			0
in 1893 , a deluded former patient shot the doctor in the head			0
the woman claimed that she lost her sanity after @entity118 hypnotized her			0
@entity139 's lymphoma @entity72 pathologist @entity139 first described the cancer that now bears his name while working at @entity142 in @entity143 in 1832			2
@entity139 published the study " on some @entity145 of the @entity146 " that year , but the condition did n't bear his name until a fellow physician , @entity148 , rediscovered @entity139 's work			1
@entity151 's disease the kidney disease bears the name of @entity151 , an @entity63 physician and colleague of @entity139 's at @entity142			1
@entity151 began looking into the causes of kidney trouble during the 1920s , and in 1927 he described an array of kidney ailments that eventually became known as @entity151 's disease			1
today , doctors understand many of the symptoms historically clumped together as @entity151 's disease are in fact different maladies , so the term is rarely used			1
@entity166 's disease @entity142 was apparently the place to work in the 19th century if you wanted to have a disease named after you			1
@entity166 , a colleague of @entity151 and @entity139 at @entity142 , first described the adrenal disorder we call @entity166 's disease in 1855			1
on top of this discovery , @entity166 also published an early study of appendicitis			1
@entity0 : 11 celebrities who overcame dyslexia 10			0
@entity179 disease although both of their names are attached to this genetic disorder , @entity181 and @entity182 did n't work together			1
in fact , they did n't even work in the same country			0
@entity181 , a @entity72 opthalmologist , first described the disease 's characteristic red spot on the retina in 1881			1
in 1887 @entity182 , a colleague of @entity30 at @entity193 , described the cellular effects of the disease and its prevalence among @entity197			2
@entity199 syndrome the chromosomal disorder got its name from @entity202 doctor @entity199 , who first described the condition in 1938			2
@entity205 's syndrome the genetic condition in which males have an extra x chromosome bears the name of @entity205 , a young @entity210 endocrinologist who published a landmark study while working under the tutelage of endocrinology star dr. @entity213 in 1942			1
@entity213 pushed his young protégé to be the lead author of the paper that described the condition , so the young @entity205 's name is forever associated with the syndrome			1
@entity222 's syndrome @entity223 pediatrician @entity222 first described the syndrome that now bears his name in 1944 after observing a group of over 400 children who suffered from what @entity222 described as " autistic psychopathy			1
" interestingly , since @entity222 's research was all written in @entity103 , his contributions to the literature went unrecognized until much later			1
the term " @entity234 " did n't come into widespread usage until 1981			0

but they are now attached to the diseases that they identified or studied
@entity223 dr. @entity222 described autistic syndrome in 1944
@entity21 's name linked to disease because it was listed first among 3 authors of study
