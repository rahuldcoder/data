@entity0 -- the head of the @entity3 defended his agency 's security procedures wednesday , telling lawmakers it is " using technology and protocols to stay ahead of the [ terrorist ] threat and keep you safe			1
" @entity14 's testimony before the @entity15 follows a controversy that broke out over the past week about the agency 's full body scans and pat - downs			1
" we 've adjusted our pat - down policy that is informed by the latest intelligence , " @entity14 told lawmakers , acknowledging that the procedures " may challenge our social norms			1
" " security is a shared responsibility , " the @entity3 chief said			1
" we are trying to detect the next generation of non-metallic devices " used in explosives , he added			0
@entity3 officials are permitted to use " professional discretion " in determining whether individuals should be subject to further screening , according to a @entity3 statement			1
but critics have called the procedures invasive			1
the @entity39 , a civil liberties organization aligned with the @entity42 right , has filed suit against homeland security secretary @entity44 and @entity14 on behalf of two pilots who refused both a full body scan and the pat - down			1
" @entity3 is forcing travelers to consent to a virtual strip search or allow an unknown officer to literally place his or her hands in your pants , " said @entity39 president @entity39			1
on tuesday , a public interest research group announced it was also suing @entity56 in a freedom of information lawsuit intended to obtain medical records and studies that it says the agency has used to evaluate its body scanners			1
the @entity64 called on transport authorities to suspend the use of advanced imaging technology and called for public hearings into its use , center spokesman @entity63 said			2
consumer advocate and former presidential candidate @entity71 joined the group 's request for more information , calling the agency secretive and unresponsive			2
scanners " present hazards when they malfunction or when they function routinely , " he said			2
@entity71 said radiation emitted by the machines was potentially hazardous to passengers , but acknowledged that most passengers in 2009 had actually favored the new measures			0
transport authorities say advanced imaging technology meets national health and safety standards			1
" these things ... have been examined six ways to sunday , " said @entity90			0
" the [ @entity94 ] , @entity95 , the @entity97 @entity96 , have all measured the radiation involved , " she said			0
" it 's almost immeasurable , it is so small			0
" in a report posted on the @entity94 website , scientists say full - body x-ray scanners pose " very low health risks			1
" the @entity94 evaluates radiation - emitting products as well as foods and medications			0
but a representative for @entity110 said the group did not evaluate the advanced imaging machines for passenger safety			2
" that was not our role , " spokeswoman @entity114 said			0
" we measured the level of radiation , which was then evaluated by @entity3			1
" @entity1 could not independently confirm whether scanners pose any risk to passenger health			2
it is also unclear how comprehensively they screen			2
the @entity125 reported in march that " it remains unclear whether the @entity128 [ scanners ] would have detected the weapon used in the december 2009 incident , " referring to a man suspected of trying to set off a bomb with explosives hidden in his underwear aboard @entity136			1
" what for example @entity125 and the inspector general and our own office of @entity3 inspection has ... found over the years is the need to be more thorough in our screening technology , " @entity14 told @entity1			1
currently there are 385 @entity128 scanners in 70 airports across the country , he said during wednesday 's hearing			2
@entity14 said he expects to expand that number to one thousand by the end of 2011			1
the @entity3 chief said that passengers concerned about the technology can decline the full body scan and instead opt for hand - searches performed by security officials			1
but some passengers and pilots have expressed objections to @entity3 's too - close - for - comfort pat - downs			1
over the weekend , a 31 - year - old man refused a pat - down at a @entity166 , @entity165 , airport			0
after arguing with a @entity3 agent , @entity167 left the airport facing a possible $ 11,000 fine , according to @entity171 , the @entity3 's federal security director in @entity166			2
a @entity173 man also told @entity1 affiliate @entity174 that he " felt violated " at a @entity176 airport			0
@entity177 , 54 , said he was headed home to @entity179 when a @entity3 officer stopped him at the @entity182 airport security checkpoint			1
@entity177 , who was patted down , claims a @entity3 officer inappropriately touched him			2
" i was wearing shorts at the time -- between the underwear , right on the skin , all the way around the back , all the way around my front , 360 degrees , touched inappropriately , " he told the affiliate			0
anyone who refuses to complete the screening process will be denied access to airport secure areas and could be subject to civil penalties , according to a @entity3 statement , citing a federal appeals court ruling in support of the rule			1
the ruling from the 9th @entity204 says " requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post- 9/11 world			0
such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by ' electing not to fly ' on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found			0
" @entity167 called the incident ridiculous and said he will not fly " until these machines go away			0
" but the mood among security officials is " anger over the way the media is playing this story , " according to a senior homeland security official			0
" you had a dutiful [ transportation security officer ] , someone who works on the front lines to protect this country from a terrorist attack , someone who did everything by the book and according to his training , and he was accosted and verbally abused by a member of the traveling public , " the official said			2
" the fact that some in the media would hail the traveler as a kind of folk hero is shameful			0
" the incident sparked a debate over passenger safety and personal privacy that has remained headline news just ahead of the holiday travel season			0
@entity14 , who addressed a @entity15 @entity252 hearing on air cargo safety on tuesday , veered off topic to plead with the @entity97 public to see airport security " as a partnership			1
" " those security officers there are there to work with you , to ensure that everybody on that flight has been properly screened , " he said			0
" everybody wants that assurance , so just try to be patient , work with our folks			0
they are there to protect you and your loved ones , and let 's make it a partnership			0
" @entity14 also sent a memo to @entity3 staff praising the work of officers -- including those who met with @entity167 in @entity166			1
" everyone involved with these latest incidents put into practice their training and experience , as you all do every day on the front lines to protect our country from terrorist attack , " he wrote			2
" they did their work with calm professionalism even as they were faced with a confrontational situation			0
" in a letter to aviation authorities , rep. @entity296 , @entity297 , raised the idea of privatization at transport hubs , which he said could improve efficiency and enable airports to opt out of @entity3 safety regulations			1
" it is both inappropriate and inefficient for the @entity3 to serve as the administrator , quality assurance regulator , operator and auditor of its own activities , " @entity296 , currently the ranking member of the @entity307 , said in the letter			2
" my aviation subcommittee staff would be pleased to assist you should you move forward with your decision to opt to have a certified private screening program at your airport , " he said			0
it is not clear whether private screening is more efficient than @entity3 procedures or whether such screenings would meet federal safety standards			1
on tuesday , capt. @entity324 -- the hero pilot who safely landed a crippled @entity326 jet on the @entity327 last year -- joined , in part , an increasingly vocal opposition to heightened airport security procedures			0
@entity324 said the use of full - body pat - downs and advanced imaging scanners -- at least for airline personnel -- " just is n't an efficient use of our resources			0
" federal transport authorities say the machines are a safe and necessary security precaution , especially following recent airline terrorism attempts .			0
