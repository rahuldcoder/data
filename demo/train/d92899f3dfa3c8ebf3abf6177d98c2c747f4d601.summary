a resolution passed in the most populous city in @entity2 could lead to a ban on assault rifles and high - capacity magazines			1
@entity8 's @entity7 members voted 10 - 3 in favor of the resolution			1
@entity10 , a @entity11 , said he was moved to sponsor the proposal after hearing what he called president @entity15 's pleas to have a discussion about weapons in our country after the deadly @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , in december			1
next , the resolution has to be presented in public hearings , voted on by the public and be approved by the state legislature before it becomes city law			1
@entity27 , @entity29 launch battle against gun lobby @entity10 said his city was n't nearly as safe as people thought , saying that " if somebody was not a convicted felon and was walking through our thoroughfare and had an @entity38 slung over his shoulder , there 's nothing we could do about that			0
most people are surprised to hear that			0
" but most people at monday 's city council meeting spoke out against the resolution , calling it too broad and unwarranted , according to @entity49 affiliate @entity48			1
@entity8 police chief @entity50 said most gun crime in the city involves handguns , not assault weapons , @entity48 reported			2
@entity2 is one of the most lenient states when it comes to gun laws , allowing concealed or openly carried firearms without permits anywhere except school property and courthouses			2
@entity49 affiliate @entity63 reported that meeting attendee @entity64 encouraged the city council to not pass the amendment based on emotions because of recent events			2
" i think it 's a dangerous course to let emotions get into the driver 's seat when writing legislation that could potentially infringe on constitutional rights			0
" @entity10 told @entity49 he had intentionally drafted the proposal broadly so that he could encompass details from officials and those in the community who support gun rights to ensure a fairly written amendment			0
he said he was not looking to keep sportsmen from hunting and people from being able to defend themselves but rather wants to make sure what happened in @entity21 did not happen in his city			0
