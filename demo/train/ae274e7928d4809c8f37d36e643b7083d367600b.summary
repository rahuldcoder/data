@entity0 was playing on her lounge floor , in her mother 's lap , when the shot tore through her cheek			1
she grimaced , cried for her mother and then went silent , as the blood began to flow in her mouth			1
the bullet came from nowhere , bursting through the frosted - glass window on the family balcony , knocking out one of her teeth , and shattering her family 's world			1
but in @entity19 , their ordeal had just begun because the struggle here is always to find medical help , fast			0
her neighbor -- the women looking after @entity0 ca n't leave their home unaccompanied by male relatives -- then rushed her to the street , carrying her body			1
that 's when we saw him , the sight of a man carrying a limp girl still striking even amid the daily atrocities of @entity19			1
he flagged down a truck and they began to race towards the hospital			1
we followed , unsure what had happened			0
after a minute , the neighbor noticed us and clearly decided our car might move through the traffic faster			0
he stopped the truck he was in , leapt out and ran towards us , @entity0 bleeding in his arms , and screamed for help			1
inside @entity48 : bombs , road blocks and ice cream he threw @entity0 onto the back seat and told us to race to the hospital , saying , " guys , she 's choking			1
" amid the traffic and blast of our horns , the sound of @entity0 's struggle to breathe was clear			1
a sucking sound , coupled with a gargle			0
the blood was flowing down her cheeks			0
her neighbor screamed out of the window for cars to pass			0
after a minute that seemed to creep by , the car arrived at the hospital			1
@entity73 sees trauma every hour in many forms			1
but a child shot in the face still causes doctors to jolt			1
they raced her into the back emergency room and began to work on her face			2
the bullet had entered her mouth cleanly but had torn up the other side of her mouth			2
soon it became clear they thought she would live			0
she was breathing more easily			0
the bandages made the wounds seem less severe			0
@entity73 is in rebel territory where medical supplies are exhausted and hard to replenish			0
the decisions doctors take daily defy belief			2
in @entity0 's case , she could not get the surgery on her face she clearly needed there , so the doctors dared to think the unthinkable , and sent her across the front lines to the better equipped government hospital			1
she was piled into a truck and then vanished			0
the women who were caring for her when the bullet struck -- her grandmother and mother -- were still at home trying to understand what had happened			1
on the stairs up to the apartment was @entity0 's blood			1
inside the apartment was her tooth			0
in the window was the small hole that the bullet had made			2
more than 100,000 refugees flee @entity48 in one month a military - trained safety adviser working with the @entity122 crew assessed the hole made by the bullet and the trajectory when it hit @entity0			1
it was clear to him that it must have been fired from one of the high apartment blocks opposite @entity0 's home			1
these buildings are inside rebel territory , but snipers -- particularly those working for the infamous pro-government militia known as the @entity135 -- are thought to work inside rebel - held areas , and few could explain why the @entity138 would shoot into areas that were sympathetic to it			2
the glass through which the bullet passed was frosted , meaning the gunman would not have seen exactly who were his targets			2
but the deliberate nature of how indiscriminate this was made it all the more chilling			0
the family members were , at that time , calm			2
they believed that @entity0 was getting the best of care and prepared for their hazardous trip to government territory to see her			1
it seemed like there had been a miraculous escape			0
the next morning , we returned			0
locals in the street broke the news to us			0
it was hard to believe that the girl we had seen recover , and who appeared so free from the bullet that should have killed her , had died from her wounds			2
the family refused to speak to us at first			2
we were told the father was angry we had entered the home and feared reprisals			0
after an hour , one relative met us outside			2
they said @entity0 had been rushed to two government hospitals			1
at each , they said , doctors had tried to help her			0
at each , they failed			0
it appears the bullet , which we did not find inside their home , had lodged inside her throat			0
a sniper 's bullet had killed a four - year - old girl , leaving us wondering how the violence now engulfing @entity19 will ever end , whether its civilians will ever recover life as they knew it			1

a bullet comes from nowhere but finds 4 - year - old @entity0 , in her mother 's lap
the shot tears through her cheek ; a family 's *desperate* rush for help begins
@entity203 hospital sees trauma every hour , in many forms , in a city *scourged* by war
but a child shot in the face still causes doctors to jolt
