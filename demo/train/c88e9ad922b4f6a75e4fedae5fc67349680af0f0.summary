after 25 years and nearly 30 trials , @entity1 's former prime minister @entity0 has for the first time been handed a definitive sentence by the country 's highest court			1
@entity0 , who served three times as premier , was found guilty of tax fraud and given a four - year sentence , of which he will serve only one year due to an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding			1
read more : @entity0 's fury at high court verdict the high court also ordered a lower court to reconsider whether @entity0 should be banned from public office			2
prosecutors had been seeking a five - year ban , but the lower court will have to review this part of the sentence , and will probably issue a three - year ban			2
so what happens next ? once the sentence goes into effect in a few days , @entity0 will have 30 days to decide how he wants to serve the one - year sentence			1
@entity29 is n't an option given that the former premier is aged 76 , so the choice is between house arrest , and more likely , community service			1
then there is the question of whether @entity0 , a member of @entity1 's @entity37 , is eligible for public office , now that he 's been convicted of a crime			1
according to @entity1 's anti-corruption law , which was passed by @entity42 's government in late 2012 , @entity0 will be ineligible to hold public office after he serves this sentence , independent of the outcome of the review by the lower court			1
the @entity1 @entity37 will need to decide when @entity0 's ineligibility begins			2
does it apply immediately , which would result in him stepping down as a senator ? or does it apply after the current parliamentary term ? either way , as things stand , @entity0 can not run for parliament for six years			0
once the public office ban is reviewed and completes its judicial journey , which will take months , it too would need a @entity37 vote for immediate enforcement , which could ban @entity0 from holding public office for the duration of the sentence			2
so what political implications does all this have on @entity66 's government and @entity1 's immediate political future ? the @entity37 vote will be the first critical step and is bound to lead to a ferocious divide in @entity72 's delicate " grand coalition " government , which is comprised of center - left parties and @entity0 's center - right @entity76 party			1
even if @entity0 was ineligible for office , there is technically nothing to stop him leading the center - right in an election campaign without running for office			0
the latest example of this in @entity1 is @entity86 , the comedian turned politician , who leads his @entity89 despite being banned from public office due to a conviction over a road accident			2
if the center - right won an election , the political office ban could be changed with a simple majority in parliament -- and with ineligibility out of the way , @entity0 could at least technically become prime minister for a fourth time once the law is abolished			1
simply put , @entity0 is down but definitely not out			0
a video statement he released thursday confirmed this and read like a call to battle and the beginning of yet another very long election campaign			0
we 're in uncharted territory , and what happens next politically is nearly impossible to predict			0
but the possible outcomes include the downfall of the government			0
what is certain is that in both the center - left and the center - right there will now be immense internal pressure			0
with some pushing for an early election as a " referendum on @entity0 " -- 43 % of voters in one @entity125 poll released friday believe @entity0 is being persecuted by magistrates -- and others trying to maintain calm in order to keep the government alive in the name of national interest , it will be a question of who blinks first			0
the cult of @entity0 : why @entity1 keep voting for ' @entity0 '			0
