-- is it a bird ? is it a plane ? no , it 's a @entity6 - like race car which will take to the track at the legendary @entity9 24 hour event in june			1
@entity11 's experimental @entity10 , which bears a startling resemblance to the vehicle made famous by the " @entity14 , " was unveiled by the @entity16 manufacturer in @entity17 on tuesday			2
the purpose of the car is to promote fuel efficiency , with the @entity10 's 1.6 liter engine set to complete motorsport 's legendary endurance challenge using half the gas of its regular counterparts			1
despite being granted entry to the marquee @entity28 race , the @entity10 will not be counted in the final @entity9 24 hour classification as it is participating as an experimental vehicle			1
" this announcement gives @entity11 the opportunity to become part of a ground - breaking motorsport project , and one which could shape the future of the sport , " @entity11 's executive vice president @entity31 said in a statement			0
" as motor racing rulebooks have become tighter over time , racing cars look more and more similar and the technology used has had less and less relevance to road car development			0
" @entity10 aims to change that , and we are delighted to have become part of the project			0
" the @entity10 's radical design has half the aerodynamic drag of a conventional car and is only half the weight			2
it can also produce 300 bhp ( horsepower ) thanks to a turbocharged four - cylinder engine			2
rather than being piloted by @entity14 's vigilante alter ego , the first two drivers of the @entity10 will be @entity57 's @entity56 , the younger brother of @entity60 legend @entity59 , and @entity61 of @entity62			1
" it 's a spectacular piece , " @entity10 designer @entity63 said			0
" we 've got the engine of our dreams : it 's the right weight , has the right power and it 's phenomenally efficient			0
