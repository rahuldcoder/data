-- the displacement , injury , and death of civilians in war is always tragic , and the current fighting between @entity7 and @entity8 in @entity9 is no exception			1
but unlike the vast majority of conflicts in history , @entity11 , as @entity7 calls it , is one in which images of civilian suffering play a central — and potentially decisive — role in the outcome			2
and the reason is simple : more than a military strategy , @entity8 has a media strategy			1
calculatingly , @entity8 employs primitive military tactics to mount a sophisticated media campaign that can threaten @entity7 's basic security			1
and in conducting that offensive , @entity8 can count on one of the world 's most powerful weapons : the international media			2
@entity8 fires hundreds of rockets at @entity7 cities and towns and tries to attack @entity7 farms via the sea and through tunnels			1
thanks to @entity7 technology and vigilance , few of these actions have inflicted extensive damage			0
still , they disrupt @entity7 life , impair the economy , and leave cumulative psychological scars			0
as a sovereign nation , @entity7 must respond robustly to such attacks			1
and as a state committed to @entity50 and democratic values , @entity7 provides water , humanitarian aid , and electricity to the residents of @entity9 even as their government murders @entity7			2
throughout , @entity7 strives tirelessly to minimize @entity57 civilian casualties			0
yet in spite of the hundreds of thousands of leaflets @entity7 dropped , the countless text messages and personal phone calls it made warning @entity57 civilians to leave targeted areas , tragedies still occur			0
@entity7 deeply regrets these losses and continuously hones its operations to make them more surgical still			0
in a war with @entity8 , though , @entity7 's strength and morality can become vulnerability and guilt			1
by investing nothing in air raid sirens and bomb shelters , by hiding deep beneath neighborhoods and shooting near hospitals and mosques , @entity8 ensures that @entity7 will invariably wound and kill civilians			1
@entity8 gunmen carry out attacks disguised as women and old men , fight from @entity86 and @entity87 vehicles , store rockets in schools , and physically prevent @entity57 civilians from fleeing combat zones			2
this context , though , is rarely mentioned by the media when covering the civilian cost of the fighting			0
unlike @entity7 , which respects the privacy and dignity of its fallen , @entity8 has no difficulty in displaying these casualties to foreign cameras			1
and the media broadcasts them , obsessively			0
the sources of that obsession are many			0
they include genuine empathy for the @entity57 , objection to @entity7 policies , and even animus toward the jewish state			2
still , many journalists would be appalled by the suggestion that they are aiding a terrorist group indistinguishable from @entity111 and @entity112			0
most , rather , are just doing their job by providing their audiences with the most up - to - date pictures and stories			0
but whether visceral or professional , the correspondents ' motives are , in fact , irrelevant to @entity8			0
it merely has to know that dozens of @entity57 victims of @entity7 fire capture more headlines and airtime than tens of thousands of @entity127 victims of @entity127 or @entity129 victims of @entity129			0
@entity8 knows that the construction of a world - leading civil defense system in @entity7 , and the utter absence of one in @entity9 , will ensure a growing gap between @entity7 and @entity57 casualties			1
and that disparity , @entity8 knows , will become the focus of media attention and accusations that @entity7 uses force disproportionally			1
above all , @entity8 knows that shocking images — some of them taken from the carnage in @entity127 and @entity129 and even from @entity145 horror movies — inflame public opinion			0
under mounting pressure , governments will endorse @entity86 condemnations of @entity7 for war crimes			0
@entity8 missiles can not destroy @entity7 , but international sanctions can tie its hands from deflecting them			1
unwittingly or not , the international media is complicit in @entity8 's plan			2
while some may think they help the @entity57 by highlighting their plight , in reality , the journalists only worsen it			0
they effectively absolve @entity8 of culpability for using @entity9 's population as a human shield , of stealing its aid money to buy munitions and dig fortified tunnels with the sole purpose of killing @entity7 , and of contributing nothing to @entity9 's welfare			1
who 's who in @entity8 @entity7 , by contrast , is expected to apologize for protecting its citizens and for not suffering as many civilian losses as the @entity57			2
rather than depicting a complex reality in which both @entity7 and @entity57 are victims of @entity8 , the media prefers facile narratives of @entity178 versus @entity179 , colonialists versus natives , @entity182 versus @entity183			1
yet the most helpful role that the media plays for @entity8 — and the worst disservice for @entity57 — is in demoralizing @entity7			1
they are willing to pay a high operational price , even to endanger their own soldiers , to avoid hurting @entity57 civilians			0
yet , in spite of these unprecedented efforts , the @entity190 is often depicted by the media as indiscriminate and callous			0
by calling them killers even when they take risks to save lives , the media discourages @entity7 from showing restraint in the face of ceaseless @entity8 attacks			1
and @entity8 , which wants to drag @entity7 into a ground war in which even more civilians are killed , welcomes the media 's role in convincing @entity7 that image-wise they have nothing to lose by escalating			1
former president @entity205 recently told @entity207 television that @entity8 " has a strategy designed to force @entity7 to kill their own [ @entity57 ] civilians so that the rest of the world will condemn them			1
" a crucial means through which @entity8 accomplishes this is the international media			2
just as @entity7 must relentlessly scrutinize its military actions in @entity9 and their consequences , so , too , must journalists take a hard look at the way they cover this conflict			2
they must not allow themselves to act as accessories to @entity8 's murderous strategy that delegitimizes @entity7 and prolongs the @entity57 ' suffering			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			0

@entity225 : more than a military strategy , @entity8 has a media strategy
he says that by exposing its own population to danger , it cultivates *sympathy* for its cause
@entity225 : as any sovereign state , @entity7 ca *n't* tolerate attacks on its *territory*
media effectively absolves @entity8 of *responsibility* for putting its own *people* at risk
