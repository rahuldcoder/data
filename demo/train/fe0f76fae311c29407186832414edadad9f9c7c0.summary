@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 has waded deep into the effort to deal with the aftermath of the world 's worst nuclear accident in a quarter century			1
his government said tuesday it would spend the equivalent of $ 470 million to try to tackle the alarming toxic water crisis at the country 's tsunami - crippled nuclear power plant			1
national authorities are stepping in as @entity14 struggles to cope with an array of daunting problems at its stricken @entity18 plant			0
the move is a gamble for @entity2 , who comfortably won elections last year and has so far remained popular			0
why @entity18 is worse than you think " today , instead of the previous stopgap countermeasures , we have put together a basic policy for countering the contaminated water issue , " @entity2 said after a ministerial meeting tuesday			1
@entity14 has accumulated a huge volume of tainted water at the site since a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 set off meltdowns at three of the plant 's reactors			1
a litany of leaks last month , it said one of roughly 1,000 huge storage tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water , prompting @entity3 's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a @entity46 serious incident , its gravest assessment since the meltdowns at the plant in 2011			1
@entity14 looks for outside help to stabilize @entity18 now , the regulator says it suspects more leaks from other containers after the company detected high radiation levels in some parts of the water storage system over the weekend			1
@entity14 is also having difficulty managing the large quantities of groundwater that flow into and out of the area around the plant each day			2
in july , it admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the @entity64 from the site , bypassing an underground barrier built to seal in the water			2
@entity68 , a former nuclear plant operator and engineer , described the groundwater problem as one of the biggest long - term issues at the plant			0
" it 's like having a leak in your basement , " he told @entity1 tuesday			0
government measures amid mounting concerns about the crisis and @entity14 's ability to deal with it , @entity2 said last month his government would step in			1
@entity85 tuna study finds miniscule health risks in the plan outlined tuesday , the government said it intends to spend roughly $ 320 million on a technologically challenging project to freeze the ground around the reactors to prevent groundwater from leaking into the plant and carrying radioactive particles with it as it seeps out			1
@entity3 ponders freezing ground the plan to freeze the ground had already been proposed by @entity14 , but the government says it is trying to speed up measures to get a grip on the water crisis			1
it earmarked a further $ 150 million for a new , more effective processing system for the tainted water at the plant			2
authorities will also replace water storage tanks that are held together by bolts with welded tanks , which have a lower risk of leaking			0
the three main elements of the government 's plan are to decrease the amount of contaminated water in and underneath the reactor buildings and surrounding trenches , keep groundwater away from already toxic water and prevent tainted water from seeping into the ocean			1
frozen ground the plan to freeze the ground around the reactors is particularly ambitious			2
the @entity3 government has previously described the task as " unprecedented			0
" the technology has been used before in the construction of tunnels , but never on the massive scale that the @entity18 plant would require			0
it also has never been used for the years or decades that experts think will be needed at the plant			0
it is likely to involve plunging tubes carrying a powerful coolant liquid deep into the ground			0
the liquid would freeze the ground solid so that no groundwater could pass through it			2
@entity68 said that the ground freezing is " a good solution as an interim fix " until the leaks underneath the reactors are permanently sealed			1
@entity14 has been grappling with water issues ever since the plant was hit by the natural disasters in 2011			2
the resulting meltdowns constituted the second - worst nuclear accident in history , trailing only the 1986 disaster at @entity158 , in the @entity159			0

the prime minister vows to move on from @entity14 's " stopgap countermeasures "
the government says it will spend about $ 320 million on a plan to freeze the ground
an expert describes that measure as a good " interim fix "
it is intended to stop groundwater from entering the site and *mixing* with toxic water
