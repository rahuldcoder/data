-- after downloading the latest @entity7 , @entity1 and @entity3 operating system , @entity4 6 , the fun part is excitedly poking around and hunting for what 's new			1
find subtle design changes , like the phone 's key pad , or set up new features , like @entity13 integration			1
you might even use @entity15 again for the first time in a while to test its improved sports and restaurant knowledge			1
if you have an @entity20 , 4 or @entity21 , a fourth generation @entity1 , or an @entity3 2 or the new @entity3 , you can upgrade to @entity4			1
go to your settings screen , tap @entity24 and then @entity25			0
keep in mind that some features are limited to the most recent models			2
here are the biggest changes to look for in the new @entity30 , good and bad and inbetween			0
maps @entity32 gave @entity34 's maps data the old heave - ho and redesigned the maps app from the ground up , helped in part by the company 's recent acquisitions of mapping companies such as @entity41			1
the resulting app is undeniably attractive and well - designed			1
it 's also an unfortunate downgrade from the previous version and the biggest disappointment of the new operating system			1
the app is missing some of the most useful features from the former @entity50 app : @entity34 's transit directions and street view images			1
some countries have also lost traffic information			2
in many locations , it also appears to be missing accurate and up - to - date information			2
@entity30 6 users have discovered numerous incorrect maps , showing farmland where there should be cities , incorrectly categorized businesses , misplaced landmarks and street addresses , and generally a lower - level of detail than is found on @entity34 's maps			1
massive demand awaits iphone 5 sale it 's not all take and no give			2
@entity32 has added one very much needed feature : turn - by - turn directions			1
previously , @entity7 users had to download apps like @entity76 to effectively use their phones for directions while on the road ( hitting " next " on the old directions each time you turned a corner was dangerous and tricky )			1
turn - by - turn is not supported on the @entity7 and earlier , the first @entity3 or any @entity3 without cellular , or the @entity1			1
a not - useful - but - still - super - cool new feature is @entity85 , which is available for a select number of areas and cities			2
this @entity90 aerial view is a kick to tap and swipe around , circling skyscrapers and cruising down streets like a bird			0
but unless you actually are a bird , the feature wo n't be of much practical use for navigation			0
flyover is only available on the @entity21 and later , @entity3 2 and later , and the @entity1			1
( if you 're outside the @entity100 , check out this breakdown of what countries are gaining and losing maps features from @entity105			2
) teasingly , there is a public transit icon when you try to search for directions , but it quickly whisks you away to a list of transit routing apps you can download in the app store , most only for one transit system or another			1
@entity34 's transit directions pulled in data from multiple services -- you could take a city bus to an unrelated train system traveling across state lines			1
downloading all the transit apps still would n't be as useful as the @entity34 version			1
luckily , you can still access @entity122 from @entity123 to get the transit feature			2
@entity34 has not yet announced an official @entity126 app , but many suspect it will , just as it did for @entity128 after @entity32 removed the video - service 's baked - in app. how to wait in an iphone 5 line siri after the voice - activated @entity15 feature was announced last year for the @entity21 , it seemed everyone with the latest @entity7 was walking around asking their device questions and making requests			1
a survey by @entity139 released in march found while 87 % of @entity21 owners were using the tool at least once a month , most were using @entity15 mostly for a few basic tasks , primarily making phone calls and sending texts			1
a new batch of features may broaden their horizons			2
the most useful addition is @entity13 and @entity150 integration			0
you can dictate 140 characters to share on @entity150 or an update for your @entity13 timeline			2
@entity32 has teamed up with some outside companies to improve results			1
@entity158 improves movie reviews , @entity157 beefs up restaurant results and makes it easy to make a reservation using @entity15			1
sports nuts will dig the @entity165 - fueled scores			1
other new features include being able to launch apps and get local - focused search results			1
are you lining up for the @entity170 ? photos the camera is one of the @entity7 and @entity1 's killer features ( less so on the @entity3 , if only because holding up a giant rectangle to take a snapshot is cumbersome )			1
new camera features are always one of the more fun updates , and this round has two notable new tools			2
( last @entity4 update we gained the ability to edit photos directly in the @entity186 and an overlay grid			1
) first up is the ability to shoot panoramic photos , which are instantly stitched together and saved to your camera roll			0
there are plenty of apps that already do this exact thing , but having it built into the camera app makes the process easier			2
in limited testing , it also appears to be incredibly fast when processing the final image , and does a nice job of seamlessly sticking the whole affair together			0
panoramic photos go up to 280 - degrees and the final image can be as large as 28 - megapixels			0
the feature only works on the @entity21 , @entity170 and fifth - generation @entity1			1
shared photo streams are the other major new feature			0
it is almost awesome , but only for friends also in the @entity32 eco-system			1
you can now share specific photos -- say only photos of your cat or baby or cat and baby hanging out -- with one or a group of friends			0
your friends can then like and comment on the photos , which are viewable in the @entity225 app ( on phones running @entity4 6 ) , in @entity227 on a @entity228 or on an @entity229			0
private photo streams can only be viewed by people with an @entity233 account			0
it is possible to publish a photo stream as a public site for anyone to see , but it does now allow commenting or likes			0
reviews are in for @entity170 mail the @entity240 app has always been simple but effective			0
with @entity4 , @entity32 is starting to add a few extra bells and whistles , and one key feature that was mysteriously missing			2
finally , you can add a photo or video directly from within an email			0
previously , you had to start your email from the @entity225 app or paste an image in			0
it was always an odd omission			0
there is a new vip option for those important emails you ca n't dare miss. click on any sender 's name and select add to @entity254 , and in the future all emails from that address will appear in the special vip folder			0
the vip folder will show up in the @entity240 app no matter what , even if you do n't plan on using it			0
it 's also possible to flag important email			0
passbook this new @entity4 feature has potential , but it will require some time to see how it takes off			0
passbook is like a little purse for your random tickets , coupons , loyalty cards and passes from other apps			0
getting on a @entity280 plane ? first you 'll have to install the @entity280 app , then you can bring up your boarding pass in @entity271 and the attendant can scan your screen			0
in helpful twist , @entity271 reminds you of dates and times , and can offer other push notifications such as the balance on a @entity292 account			0
passbook is not available on the @entity3			2
there are other goodies in @entity4 , like the @entity298 feature , new sharing options , a " remind me later " message for ignored calls , new @entity123 offline reading tool and the ability to set a song as your alarm sound			0
timing is everything for @entity170 accessory makers			0
