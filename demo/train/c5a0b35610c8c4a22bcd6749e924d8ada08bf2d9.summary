-- enough ! enough with putting off tomorrow what we should be talking about today			0
enough with being afraid to step on someone 's delicate sensibilities when it comes to the @entity6			2
enough with elected leaders who are too cowardly to confront the @entity8 and their ardent supporters			0
enough with moms and dads and brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and pastors and deacons who are afraid to make public the private anguish of mental illness			1
enough ! enough ! enough ! enough with just asking for thoughts and prayers			0
enough with just hugging our children			0
enough with leaving flowers and teddy bears at a makeshift memorial			0
it 's time for action			1
it 's time for people of conscience to , in the words of the late civil rights activist @entity33 , be " sick and tired of being sick and tired			1
" @entity35 , 20 of our children are dead , and we are all paralyzed , not knowing what to do or say			1
i 've shed tears for the lives of the innocent children and adults at @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			0
many of you have likely done the same			0
opinion : mourn , and take action on guns we witnessed the president of the @entity35 , @entity51 , stand before the country fighting back tears talking about the lives lost , reminding of us other tragedies involving guns and sick individuals behind the trigger			1
and every time this happened , those who refuse to discuss gun control are quick to say , " now is not the time			1
" one day after @entity65 linebacker @entity64 shot and killed his girlfriend , @entity66 , @entity63 anchor @entity62 said it was time to talk about this nation 's fascination with guns			1
instead of being hailed as an honest communicator , he was vilified for having the audacity to raise the subject at the halftime of a football game			0
polls : your thoughts on gun control have we become such a nation of cowards that we are desperate to not discuss a real issue , instead saying , " please , shut up so i can watch the game ? " yet today , we are glued to the television , unable to turn from the scene in @entity43 , @entity44 , eager to find every new detail as to what led to the horrific mass murder of a classroom full of kindergartners			1
share your thoughts on the shooting it was n't time to talk about this when rep. @entity98 was shot in the head , and six others were killed in january 2011			2
it was n't time in july 2012 when 12 people were blown away in a movie theater in @entity104			2
@entity105 were killed at a @entity107 temple near @entity108 near august , and we were told then , " now is not the time			2
" so , please , exactly when is the time ? this nation , whether we want to admit it not , is one that is fascinated and enraptured with guns			2
it courses through our veins like heroin shooting through the arms of an addict			0
we love to see it in our movies , video games , on television , and then we 'll fiercely defend the right to bear arms , all while flagrantly waving the @entity126 in the face of anyone who objects			0
news : @entity51 remains committed to assault weapons ban , @entity131 there is absolutely no reason why we need as many guns in @entity35			1
it simply should n't be the way of life others are so quick to defend			0
there is absolutely no doubt that we need tough and stringent gun control			1
not solely to prevent murders like those in @entity44 , but to remove the option when someone is angered , depressed or in the case of too many , mentally ill. and that 's the second issue that it 's time that we come to grips with in this country : we are a nation that has chosen to either medicate or ignore altogether			1
" they have a few screws loose			0
" " you know he 's off his rocker			2
" we 've heard all of the terms			0
we often laugh and dismiss the mentally ill in @entity35 , choosing to cross the street when we see the homeless veteran screaming and cussing at anyone who walks by			1
when it 's time for budget cuts , those most vulnerable often get thrown out first			1
for years @entity35 cities , counties and states have shirked their responsibility when it comes to the mentally ill , choosing to abandon helping them , but quick to build a new prison to incarcerate them when a law is broken			1
now we wait to see if the @entity43 , @entity44 , killer will be the latest @entity177 ( @entity98 ) , @entity178 ( @entity179 ) , or @entity180 ( @entity104 movie theater all individuals who were described as mentally unstable			2
timeline : school violence in the @entity35 too often the warning signs were there , but ignored for one reason or another			1
could any of these tragedies have been prevented ? no one knows for sure			0
but i sure as hell would rather try than have to be a first responder and look a parent in the eye and say , " sir or ma'am , i 'm sorry			0
but your baby is dead , killed in the classroom along with 19 other classmates			0
" see , now is the time that they are having that conversation			2
now is the time those parents are grieving the loss of their babies			0
now is the time parents in @entity43 , @entity44 are eschewing @entity206 plans to prepare for a funeral			0
school shooting : shattering the sense of safety @entity35 , now is the time for us to stop living in denial			1
we must address mental illness			1
we must have the courage and conviction to put aside our political views and deal with the task at hand			0
@entity35 , now is the time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : enough with our cowardice in dealing with gun control , mental illness
@entity223 : it 's time for action , and to be " sick and tired of being sick and tired "
he says there is absolutely no reason why we need so many guns in @entity35
@entity223 : we must also not avoid our responsibilities when it comes to the mentally ill
