-- on a hot april afternoon , young @entity1 had the lead and only nine holes to play before he could become the @entity5 golf champion			1
just 24 hours later , the @entity6 would tweet a picture of himself and @entity9 on a jet , both smiling , and one of them wearing the famed green jacket awarded to the winner of the most revered golf title in the world			1
for on that april sunday , he had fallen apart , blown his lead big - time , shooting a horrendous 8 - over - par 80			0
@entity9 leaped over him and other contenders to win one of the most exciting masters ever with birdies on the final four holes			1
@entity1 's tumble started on the 10th hole , when he hit a tee shot like a public course duffer into the woods and ended up losing three strokes to par. but after his very visible loss , the then - 21 - year - old did n't hide from defeat or from the press			1
" i did n't handle [ the adversity on the course ] particularly well , obviously , but it was a character - building day , put it that way , " he said that night			0
" i 'll come out stronger for it			0
" some of the media , impressed by his grace , trotted out the well - worn cliche : he has the talent , but time will tell if he has the stuff champions are made of			1
it did n't take long for @entity1 to prove he does			1
two months later , in the next major golf tournament , he thoroughly dominated the @entity49 open field all four days , winning by an unheard - of eight shots			1
" he 's certainly captured everyone 's imagination , " said @entity51 , a senior writer for @entity52 and @entity53			2
but @entity51 warned it might be a little early to call @entity1 the next @entity57 , who won the masters at age 21 after winning three @entity49 amateur championships			1
" i would hold off on handing him the crown just yet , " he said of the no. 3 - ranked player in the world			0
" but he 's got a great swing , and he is impressive			2
both started as very , very young players			0
both appeared on a tv show as a prodigy -- woods on @entity73 at age 3 ; @entity1 appearing on a @entity75 show at age 9			1
both were beating older golfers while in their teens and winning many junior tournaments			2
@entity1 told @entity0 's @entity81 that he sees only a few connections between himself and @entity57			1
" you know , at 22 , we both had one major			1
he won a couple more times than i have in my career , " @entity1 said			1
" but i mean i have to let other people make comparisons , because if i go -- am trying , you know , to chase his records -- i 'll lose sight of what i need to do to actually -- to win tournaments			2
" and while trying to remain somewhat modest , he agreed with the assessment that he 'll be mentioned in future discussions as the greatest ever			0
" yeah , i do			0
but i do n't really know if people want to hear that			0
i mean , i believe that myself			0
yes , " he told @entity81			1
" i 'm very confident in my own abilities			0
... " i said something a couple of days ago			0
i said , i 'm not playing for money , i 'm playing for a place in history			0
" both @entity57 and @entity107 have predicted a very high place in history for @entity1			1
after the @entity111 win , @entity107 , who 's counseled @entity1 for several years , said , " he 's humble when he ought to be and confident when he needs to be			1
" the mop - haired , freckled kid is very likeable , too , @entity51 said , and not just because of his adorable looks			0
he 's good people , too			2
it 's is n't something put on for the fans now that he is rich and famous , the writer said			2
and it 's not a recent development			2
@entity51 recalled asking the young man for an interview as he readied for the 2007 @entity111 , one of his first times in the media spotlight			0
despite being pursued by the press , the then - 18 - year - old was like sure thing , whatever you need , no question is off limits			0
and he 's still that same normal guy today , @entity51 said			2
the kind of fella who gets on a plane just after choking away the lead at the masters and tells his buddy , the guy who won , to put on the green jacket because he wants to take a picture			2
that he tweets with the message : flying to @entity141 with charl ! glad one of us has a green jacket on ! ! ! or the kind of lad who goes to @entity147 the week before the @entity148 , finding a little life perspective to help his golf game			2
@entity1 's success is no fluke , said @entity153 , host of @entity0 's " @entity154			1
" his talent was obvious from the day @entity1 first picked up a club			1
which was when he was 2			0
and he hit the ball 40 yards			0
it was his desire to be a great golfer that prompted his devoted parents , @entity163 and @entity164 , to get behind their prodigious child			0
they worked night shifts and two and three extra jobs to fund his ambitions			2
his dad often bartended at the @entity171 in @entity172 , where @entity1 would practice			1
to this day , @entity1 never takes this support for granted , @entity153 said			1
@entity1 has always been keen to point out that he was never pushed by his parents , that it was indeed him doing all the pushing , all the dreaming and , crucially , all the practice			1
his father is a good golfer , too , and with uncles who are also low handicappers , there has always been a competitive arena among the @entity1 clan since the earliest days at @entity184			1
that 's where @entity1 's sporting passion was fostered			1
these days , @entity1 still often has family and friends nearby when he competes			1
they wo n't have too far to travel when the @entity111 , the third major of the year , tees off thursday in @entity191 , @entity192 , with @entity1 likely to be the betting and fan favorite			1
" he 's going to have the crowd behind him like they were for @entity57 when he was winning everything , " @entity51 said			2
" it 'll be a ' home game ' for him			0
he 's used to playing in that kind of weather , and he 's going to have a big comfort zone			2
he 'll be the favorite in the @entity111 for the next 10 years			0
" the @entity205 's course is " quirky , " @entity51 said			2
it 's where a brisk wind can take a shot that starts in the center of the fairway and push it into rough terrain or worse -- deep bunkers			0
if @entity1 wins again , no doubt his popularity among fans in @entity216 and the @entity49 will take off exponentially			1
the question then becomes : will he continue to play mostly on his home continent , or will he come to @entity49 , where the tournament paydays are much larger ? while it would disappoint @entity222 officials , @entity1 will probably continue to play overseas , @entity51 guessed			1
he can still play in eight to 10 tournaments in the @entity49 ( three majors and another handful of top - level tournaments ) and still be a player whom advertisers will seek out			0
he already reportedly makes millions each year in endorsements and appearance fees			0
but the injured @entity231 missed the @entity148 and will also sit out the @entity232			0
he also missed a good portion of 2010 because of his infidelity scandal			0
@entity154 's popularity has suffered with the absence of the player who was a strong favorite to win every tournament he played			1
as @entity240 told @entity241 of @entity52 : " but for casual fans , i think they need a dominant player to focus on			0
they need to know what the story line is			0
" if you were a wagering person , @entity51 said , the smart money would be on a 22 - year - old kid from @entity75 with a poodle - like fro and a big smile			1
and a man who learned a very big lesson on a miserable day in april .			0

@entity1 , 22 , hails from @entity75 , where he rose through the junior golf ranks
@entity1 *bounced* back from disappointment at the @entity5 to win the next major tournament
some predict greatness for him , and he tells @entity81 he can be the best ever
@entity1 's family made *sacrifices* , with dad bartending among his several jobs
