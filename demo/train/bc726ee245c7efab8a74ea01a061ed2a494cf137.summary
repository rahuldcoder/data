@entity1 back in 2016 spotlight @entity6 , the @entity39 governor and likely 2016 @entity12 presidential candidate , was here at @entity42 last week headlining a small fundraiser for a state representative named @entity45 -- the kind of early , iou - collecting legwork one does in a key primary state when running for president , and the kind of back - slapping environment in which @entity6 , a masterful retail politician , thrives			1
