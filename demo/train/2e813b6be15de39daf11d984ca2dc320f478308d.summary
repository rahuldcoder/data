-- something remarkable is happening wednesday			0
a large swath of the @entity3 is blacking out in protest of two controversial copyright bills being considered in @entity6			1
major web juggernauts such as @entity8 and @entity9 , some graduate schools and a number of start - ups and prominent advocates are participating in what is expected to be the largest organized online protests in more than a decade			2
while the actions vary from site to site -- some are shutting down , some are turning their pages black -- the message is clear : neither the @entity24 's @entity23 nor the @entity26 's @entity25 represents a consensus view on how to address online piracy without undermining the open @entity3 , and neither should be rushed to a vote			1
the bills propose new enforcement tactics to be carried out by @entity3 intermediaries -- internet service providers , search engines , payment processors and ad networks -- against foreign websites that flagrantly infringe @entity39 intellectual property rights			1
this is a laudable goal , but some of the proposed measures would do more harm than good , and there is significant risk that the bills as they currently stand could infringe on first amendment rights			0
the online backlash against the legislation , which began with the introduction in october of the @entity26 bill , known as @entity25 , is already having a meaningful impact			1
large social media sites and online communities have spread the word , and thousands of @entity3 users have kept up a steady stream of calls and tweets at their senators and representatives			0
under intense pressure from their constituents , sen. @entity62 and rep. @entity63 , the bills ' principal sponsors , issued separate statements last week indicating that they would revise the bills to remove requirements that @entity71 attempt to block access to websites using the domain - name system , or @entity75			1
in addition , a group of six republicans -- including co-sponsors of the legislation -- sent a letter to senate majority leader @entity82 urging him not to proceed to a vote on the @entity23 , or @entity23 , citing the public outcry as well as their own concerns			1
and on saturday , the @entity26 issued a formal response to two petitions that had each received more than 50,000 signatures			0
the @entity90 administration said it would oppose legislation that risks online censorship of lawful activity , inhibits innovation or creates new cybersecurity risks -- all charges that have been levied against @entity23 and @entity25			1
it also criticized mandated dns - filtering on cybersecurity grounds , offered some guiding principles and called for continued discussion between proponents , opponents and the public on how best to proceed			0
however , the @entity24 remains scheduled to try to break a filibuster against @entity23 next week			1
if that vote succeeds , the @entity24 will move to an up - or - down vote on a bill -- currently being revised -- that no one has seen			0
if the @entity75 - filtering provision is indeed removed , it will be a major improvement , but this is not @entity23 's only problem			2
countless technologists and advocates still question whether the remaining enforcement tactics meet the balanced , sensible criteria laid out by the @entity26			0
there is still room for debate and a path forward on anti-piracy legislation			0
some of @entity23 and @entity25 's biggest opponents have expressed support for an approach that would " follow the money " by requiring carefully targeted action by payment processors and ad networks to stem the flow of revenue to websites that make a business of infringement			1
but despite rumored changes , @entity23 is not yet that bill			2
@entity82 should delay next week 's @entity24 vote to give the bill a real chance of developing into something all sides can agree on			0
editor 's note : @entity142 , the parent company of @entity0 , is among the industry supporters of the legislation			2
