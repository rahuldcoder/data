the @entity0 bears a broad grin , flashing an " ok " sign to the @entity4 support team tending to him after his descent from space			1
it 's not exactly the image of two countries at extreme odds over the @entity13 crisis			0
but in the world of @entity0 - @entity4 relations , space is impervious , as demonstrated by the joint effort to bring @entity0 astronaut @entity18 and his cosmonaut counterparts , @entity20			1
@entity21 , a native of @entity23 , and fellow flight engineer @entity24 , home to @entity26			2
the @entity28 spacecraft landed in @entity29 early tuesday after the trio spent more than five months aboard the @entity31 , leaving the multinational astronaut delegation of @entity34 's @entity33 , @entity0 's @entity35 and @entity4 's @entity36 to finish the orbital laboratory 's @entity37			1
those three are expected to return home in mid-may , after being joined by another international team : @entity42 ( @entity0 ) , @entity43 ( @entity4 ) and @entity44 ( @entity45 ) are in @entity46 , @entity4 , training for their march 25 launch from @entity50 in @entity29 , @entity41 says			1
@entity21 is a space veteran returning from his third mission and 526th day in space			0
@entity18 and @entity24 are rookies			0
this mission marked their first 166 days in space , @entity41 says			0
@entity18 conducted a pair of @entity0 spacewalks for a total 12 hours and 58 minutes			2
@entity24 conducted three @entity4 spacewalks during his mission working outside the station for 20 hours and five minutes			0
on @entity26 , the @entity0 may be trading bitter accusations with @entity4 over @entity13 , but in space , it 's a different story			1
@entity65 vs. @entity66 : facing off over facts in @entity13 the space collaboration between the two nations has survived other diplomatic kerfuffles -- most recently , the war in @entity69 and asylum for @entity72 leaker @entity71 -- and there 's no need to worry , @entity41 says			1
" we do not expect the current @entity4 - @entity13 situation to have any impact on our civil space cooperation with @entity4 , including our partnership on the @entity31 program , " said @entity78 , a @entity41 spokesman , pointing out that it 's in both countries ' best interests not to disrupt " operations that have maintained continuous human presence on orbit for over a decade			1
" @entity78 added , " @entity41 and its @entity4 counterpart , @entity91 , have maintained a professional , beneficial and collegial working relationship through the various ups and downs of the broader @entity0 - @entity4 relationship and we expect that to continue			1
" ' reluctant co-dependency ' the two nations ca n't afford temporary tussles to upend a costly relationship -- one that @entity101 , a former space engineer , describes as " reluctant co-dependency			0
" in 2011 , @entity41 retired its space shuttle fleet , its only means of getting to and from the station			0
now , @entity4 @entity107 capsules ferry @entity0 astronauts and cosmonauts , together with supplies that can fit in the smaller craft			1
in turn , the @entity0 brings to the table technology far more advanced than @entity4 's capabilities , @entity101 told @entity115			1
at the same time , many of the @entity4 systems are more reliable because they are simpler and have been operating longer , @entity116 , former @entity41 astronaut and @entity31 commander , told @entity120			1
the space station itself has an intricate blend of both countries ' contributions -- from @entity0 solar arrays and power systems to @entity4 core life - support systems , to a navigation system that comes from both countries , he said			1
@entity0 and @entity4 train on each other 's systems , but one country ca n't run the station alone , he said			2
the mission control centers in @entity136 and @entity137 , near @entity138 , have to coordinate commands sent to the station , he said			0
" we need each other to operate the station , " @entity116 said			0
" otherwise we run the risk of losing that asset			0
" a pretty penny what 's more , the agreement between the two nations is n't exactly cheap			0
according to a new deal @entity41 signed with the @entity91 , the @entity0 will pay @entity4 $ 71 million to ferry each astronaut to the space station			1
the emergence of private companies in the space transport business may change the game			0
@entity41 has a $ 1.6 billion contract with @entity158 to fly at least 12 cargo resupply missions to the space station , and a $ 1.9 billion contract with @entity161 for eight such missions			0
@entity158 is gearing up for its third commercial resupply mission this month ; @entity161 completed its first in february			0
as for transporting astronauts , @entity41 said in november that it 's seeking to partner with @entity0 companies for human trips to the station as well , by 2017			2
that could end @entity0 reliance on @entity4 for space voyages			2
but for now , experts say , the @entity0 - @entity4 relationship on space remains a marriage of convenience .			2

@entity0 @entity18 returns to @entity26 with @entity4 , @entity23 cosmonauts
even if @entity0 , @entity4 are at odds , space collaboration endures , @entity41 says
@entity0 astronauts have no way to get to and from the @entity31
in return , @entity0 brings money , more advanced technology to table
