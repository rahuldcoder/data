@entity0 , @entity1 -- aspiring entrepreneur @entity3 began selling clothes from a truck because she was looking for a way to stay in one place			1
that might sound odd until you learn she is a wardrobe stylist based in @entity0 who tours the world with musical acts			2
it was 2010 , and she had just married her husband , a sound technician she met while touring with @entity17 , when she decided to set down roots			2
given her two decades of experience dressing male performers including @entity21 and members of @entity23 , she set her sights on opening a menswear store			2
when she could n't find a location that fit her budget , she went into business with @entity0 fashion designer @entity29			1
drawn to the opportunity to keep startup costs low , they decided to take a chance on mobile retail , which was catching on in @entity0 after starting a few years earlier on the @entity35			1
people buy tacos and barbecue from retrofitted trucks and campers and some even live in them , so it was likely just a matter of time before entrepreneurs started using them to sell clothes , jewelry and shoes			1
" we can bring our products to you instead of waiting for you to come to us , " said @entity47 in an interview in her truck last week , a former @entity52 truck from @entity53 she found on @entity55			1
it took about $ 25,000 to get " @entity59 " up and running in spring 2012 , with @entity61 's dresses and jewelry on one side of the 10 - by - 5 - foot retail space and @entity47 's selection of men 's hats and grooming products on the other			1
people follow the @entity59 's movements on @entity72 and on its website			2
on any given day , it could be a music festival , a tailgate , a restaurant parking lot or outside a @entity17 concert when the band plays in @entity0			2
named so it could accommodate a rotating cast of products , brands or designers , @entity47 sees it as a " medicine chest " of opportunities			1
" it just made sense			2
there 's less overhead , and we can usually cover it in one day , " she said			0
" i love the possibilities of the truck			0
we can use it to sell clothes or whatever we want			1
" most people launch mobile boutiques as faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional brick and mortar retail , said @entity102 , who launched @entity103 with business partner @entity104 in @entity105 in 2010			1
usually , there 's no lease involved and monthly expenses are lower than they would be to run a store			0
before inventory , @entity103 's monthly costs run from $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 for generator , liability and auto insurance , cleaning supplies and storage rent , for starters			0
that pales in comparison to rent alone for a retail space , which could start at $ 7,000 in @entity105 , @entity118 said			1
as budding entrepreneurs look for new ways to stand out from the crowd , interest in mobile retail appears to be growing			1
@entity118 and @entity104 started the @entity35 @entity127 in 2011 to unite and support mobile boutique owners			1
it now has 32 members , some of whom have taken active roles in proposing legislation and working with cities to develop regulations for mobile retail			1
in response to growing numbers of inquiries from outside the @entity35 , the @entity137 expanded to become the @entity141 , which has 60 members from across the country and new inquiries coming in each day , @entity118 said			0
" it 's just a new way of doing business			0
it 's creative , it 's interesting , it 's the now , " she said in a phone interview			0
most of the boutiques carry women 's clothing and accessories and gifts in the vein of what you might find on @entity162 , but some trucks are expanding into shoes and sneakers , records , even flowers			1
but , it 's labor intensive , physically and otherwise , the pair has learned			0
when they 're not on their feet setting up and breaking down the 10 - by - 5 - foot retail space , or checking the generator , they 're looking for new places to show or ensuring their permits , licenses and knowledge of local codes are current			1
recently , through @entity137 , they proposed new permit legislation			0
" there 's still no business plan template for this kind of business , so it 's all happening on a case - by - case basis , " @entity118 said			1
" the rules are still being written and figured out and the owners of mobile boutiques are at the forefront of the action			1
" the trucks are also becoming springboards for online boutiques and occasionally an actual storefront			2
it cost @entity199 of @entity200 , @entity201 , ( known for its truck - friendly policies ) about $ 2,000 to gut , paint and re-panel a 1969 @entity205 trailer formerly used for hunting excursions and transform it into a two - rack vintage boutique with a tiny dressing corner in 2010			1
by july 2012 she had nearly enough capital to open a store in @entity200 by the same name , @entity212			0
through the trailer , she learned how to run a retail business while generating revenue to invest in a real store			2
she worried at first that not having the novelty of the trailer would make it hard to distinguish herself from other vintage stores			2
but , she has found that having a permanent location makes it easier for her to build a loyal customer base that knows where to find her , she said			0
" they 're just really different experiences			0
people were so amazed by the trailer itself and the setup			0
you 'd get into these really funny situations when people had to use the teeny dressing room , " she said			0
though she misses the " intimacy " of the trailer , she can carry more inventory now and become involved in the business community , she said			0
" now , it seems like i 'm a little more established			0
people know where to find me , and i have a lot more regulars			0
i 'm a business owner and people in the community embrace me for that			0
" @entity199 , 30 , still plans to use the trailer on a more selective basis , like festivals and fairs , of which @entity200 has a lot in the spring and summer			0
@entity47 is also looking forward to spring in @entity0			0
unlike its @entity35 counterparts , who enjoy mobile retail - friendly weather most of the year , " @entity59 " had to hibernate for winter ; it gets cold in @entity0 , after all			1
when " @entity59 " reopens in 2013 , @entity47 plans to expand offerings for women since they make up the majority of customers , she said			0
being at the mercy of inclement weather is one downside to mobile retail along with hoping customers will find you , she said			1
@entity268 and mortar stores rely on the same good fortune , of course			1
but a truck can pick up and leave if business is n't good			0
