-- @entity1 announced tuesday that it is replacing its pilots ' flight decks with @entity4			1
rather than carry around 38 pounds of operating manuals , charts and logbooks , the 11,000 pilots at @entity1 and @entity6 will use a pre-loaded @entity4			1
@entity1 started distributing @entity4 to pilots earlier this month and plans to have devices to all pilots by the end of the year			1
@entity1 joins a growing list of airlines that have started converting some or all of their pilots to using electronic flight bags			0
@entity20 announced in may its intentions to switch from paper to the @entity4			1
last week , @entity23 and @entity24 started testing the use of @entity4 and other consumer tablets as replacements for traditional paper flight bags			2
according to @entity1 , moving away from paper to the @entity4 will do more than increase efficiency and improve safety : " each @entity4 , which weighs less than 1.5 pounds , will replace approximately 38 pounds of paper operating manuals , navigation charts , reference handbooks , flight checklists , logbooks and weather information in a pilot 's flight bag			2
a conventional flight bag full of paper materials contains an average of 12,000 sheets of paper per pilot			0
the green benefits of moving to @entity46 are two-fold it significantly reduces paper use and printing , and , in turn , reduces fuel consumption			0
the airline projects @entity46 will save nearly 16 million sheets of paper a year which is equivalent to more than 1,900 trees not cut down			0
saving 326,000 gallons of jet fuel a year reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 3,208 metric tons			0
" electronic flight decks will allow pilots to update their materials instead of waiting for printed distribution , and the decrease in weight will also be easier on a pilot 's luggage			1
our question is : what happens in the event of a device failure ? we assume that backup systems will be in place so that paper flight kits or replacement @entity4 devices will be available in the event of a broken pre-flight tablet			2
