@entity1 , @entity0 -- the one thing that @entity0 know for certain is that their next president is not a woman			1
that is because there are no female candidates contesting the presidential elections			1
all of those running for election can be classified into two categories ; islamists or @entity14			0
but within each camp there are distinctions and gradations			0
there are secularist left - wing candidates , secularist autocrats and secularist old guard			2
then there are progressive @entity24 , moderate @entity24 , revolutionary @entity24 and right - wing ones			0
the one thing that they all have in common is the banality of their engagement with women 's rights and with questions of gender justice			1
throughout the official 21 days of presidential propaganda , we the public have learned that all the candidates " value " women and believe that women are half of the @entity0 society and therefore should be respected and honored			1
a near century of @entity0 feminism and our candidates can only offer a cloyingly condescending stance on the rights of the voters who will enable one of them to become a president			1
this is the sad truth about @entity0 politics			1
it is women who attend rallies , who accept trivial bribes of sugar and rice and who stand in the very long queues to vote			2
@entity0 segregates its polling stations , so the remarkable length of women - only queues is evident for all to see			1
yet women are ignored as political agents and as citizens in all presidential programs			1
see also : women and the @entity70 uprisings it is true that these programs are very similar and are generally lacking but still , the projections they make of women and their rights are noteworthy			1
female heads of houses feature prominently in these programs			0
women living in poverty are being promised cash transfers , medical insurance and access to finance and services			2
yet these women need not wait for a new president as they are already entitled to all these benefits ! our candidates have also promised women access to senior executive positions			1
candidates like @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 have said " there is no objection to a woman becoming ... " then finishing the sentence by referring to positions such as vice president or some other senior function			2
this is also sadly a meaningless gesture since there are no legal or constitutional barriers to a woman assuming high office in any branch of the executive , legislature or now the judiciary			0
our candidates are promising to solve the problems that already have solutions , but what about the ones that do n't ? what about to the proliferation of gender discrimination ? what about their position on repeated attempts to repeal family - status laws that gave women the right to unilateral divorce , which enabled women to keep custody and guardianship of their children until the age of 15 , instead of being deprived of their seven - year - old sons or nine - year - old daughters if they are divorced from the father ? @entity0 has one of the lowest rates of female labor - force participation ( 20 % ) in the world and perhaps the lowest rate of female representation in parliament ( 2 % )			1
women are present , vocal , active , but excluded and undermined			0
the new president should have something to say about this paradox			0
but perhaps candidates would rather remain silent on gender issues so as to please their male supporters			2
see also : revolution signals new dawn for @entity0 's women the current constitutions of @entity0 guarantee equality and rights to all citizens			1
but the right to rights is a far cry from the attainment of these rights			0
women in @entity0 need a vocal champion who will not interfere with their choice of clothes , career or spouse , but who will guarantee that they have access to jobs , to legal protection , and to freedom and equality within marriage and outside it			1
women are given sugar , rice and other staples so that they choose the generous candidate			0
they are being cajoled and gently coerced to give their voices to the candidate chosen by their family or kin			0
they are not , however , respected as political agents nor " courted " as supporters with interests and rights			2
what they need is a commitment , not a handout			0
a commitment to justice can come from a religious or a secular candidate			0
women need not fear a president who " uses " religion to please the masses and get their votes -- nor be disappointed when the veneer of secularism cracks to reveal an ambivalent chauvinist			0
whatever " style " choices these candidates make , they matter less than their substantive policies and positions			0
women in @entity0 should not hold their breath or wait for a savior but rather continue to organize and struggle for social , political and economic rights and freedoms			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity0 's women ignored by presidential candidates , says @entity216
she says candidates have n't *addressed* gender discrimination
women in @entity0 should continue to organize and struggle for social and political rights
