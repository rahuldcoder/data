-- @entity1 surprised the world tuesday by releasing " @entity5 , " their first album in five years , as a gift from @entity4			1
it was available for free immediately to anyone with @entity9			1
the band made the announcement with @entity4 ceo @entity12 at a @entity14 press conference for the new @entity15 6 , capping the event with a performance of the album 's first single , " the miracle ( of @entity19 )			1
" after a standing ovation , @entity12 said , " was n't that the most incredible single you ever heard ? we would love a whole album of that			2
" catch up on the @entity4 launch : the live blog " the question is now , how do we get it to as many people as possible , because that 's what our band is all about , " @entity28 said			1
" i do believe you have over half a billion subscribers to @entity9 , so -- could you get this to them ? " " if we gave it away for free , " @entity12 replied			1
and five seconds later , the album was unleashed in the largest album release of all time			2
" we wanted to make a very personal album , " @entity28 told @entity0 's @entity42 the day before the press conference in an exclusive interview			1
" let 's try to figure out why we wanted to be in a band , the relationships around the band , our friendships , our lovers , our family			1
the whole album is first journeys â € ” first journeys geographically , spiritually , sexually			2
" the band worked on " @entity59 " for two years with producer @entity60 ( a.k.a. @entity60 ) , then brought in additional help : @entity64 , their collaborator since 1987 's " the @entity66 , " plus @entity67 producers @entity68 and @entity69			2
" i think having them around really helped , " @entity28 said			1
" some of the music out there now that people call pop , it 's not pop -- it 's just truly great			2
and we wanted to have the discipline of the @entity76 or the @entity77 in the ' 60s , when you had real songs			2
there 's nowhere to hide in them : clear thoughts , clear melodies			2
" innovative album releases that shook the music industry to begin , the band went back to its roots			2
@entity28 said the group listened to the music they loved in the ' 70s , from punk rock to @entity91 , glam rock , early electronica and @entity94			1
the album kicks off with " the miracle ( of @entity19 ) , " a loping pop song laced with distinctly punk - ish power chords			0
" i found my voice through @entity19 because i was n't the obvious punk - rock singer , or even rock singer , " @entity28 said			1
" i sang like a girl -- which i 'm into now , but when i was 17 or 18 , i was n't sure			0
and i heard @entity19 , who sang like a girl , and that was my way in			0
" the driving , reggae - tinged " this is where you can reach me now " is a tribute to the @entity110 , with slinky guitars from the edge that nod to @entity113 !			0
" after we saw the @entity110 , it was a sort of blueprint for @entity1 , " @entity28 said			1
" we knew we could n't possibly hope to be as cool , and that 's proven to be true , but we did think we could get behind a sort of social justice agenda			0
" there is also an intensely personal song about @entity28 's mother , @entity123 , who died when he was 14			1
" forty years ago , my mother fell at her own father 's funeral , and i never spoke with her again , " he says			0
" rage always follows grief , and i had a lot of it , and i still have , but i channeled it into music and i still do			0
i have very few memories of my mother , and i put a few of them in a song called ' @entity123			0
' " @entity1 's ' @entity5 ' : a track - by - track guide the most joyous track on " @entity5 " is " @entity140 ( there is no end to @entity142 ) , " which unexpectedly nods to the @entity143 in its intro			1
" it 's like the sun itself , " @entity28 said			1
" it 's about our first trip to @entity151			0
" the darkest track , meanwhile , is " @entity152 , " which tells of a deadly car bombing in @entity155			0
" it was a real incident that happened in our country where three car bombs were set to go off at the same time in @entity155 on a friday night , 5:30 , " the artist said			0
" on any other friday i would have been at this record shop , just down the corner , but i cycled to school that day			0
" at times , " @entity5 " feels almost like a concept album about @entity28 's early years -- there 's even a track named after the street where the singer grew up , " @entity169			1
" " it has a lyrical cohesion that i think is unique amongst @entity1 albums , " @entity28 said			1
" i do n't want it to be a concept album , but the songs come from a place			0
edge laughed and said this is our ' quadrophenia			0
' we could be so lucky			0
