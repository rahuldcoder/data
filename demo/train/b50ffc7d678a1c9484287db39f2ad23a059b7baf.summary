the newly - renovated @entity1 football stadium looms into sight up ahead			1
driving just past it , we see women standing on street corners , leaning into cars and flashing nearly naked bodies in the low light			1
we 're in @entity10 in the northeastern corner of @entity12 , one of the @entity15 host cities but also known as a magnet for sex tourism			1
prostitution is legal in @entity12 for those 18 or older , but government and soccer officials are trying stto crack down on the child sex trade before the tournament kicks off in june			1
@entity25 , a social worker with @entity26 , says the prostitutes around the stadium now cater to truckers but dream about big bucks from visiting fans			1

" with these mega events , sexual exploitation is also going to be organized much more via the @entity81			2
" despite promises to eradicate child prostitution , the number of estimated child sex workers in @entity12 stood at about half a million in 2012 , according to the non-profit @entity86 for the @entity87			1
@entity10 is considered a hotspot for child sex tourism , due in part to the widespread poverty as well as a now long - standing reputation that means potential clients continue to seek out the beach resort over other @entity12 destinations , often chartering planes direct from @entity97 , according to prosecutors			1
it will also host six @entity15 games including teams and fans from @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity106			1

" paying for sex with anyone 17 or under is absolutely illegal			2
" in @entity10 , there has been a police crackdown on child prostitution and the city government says it has implemented new programs , but officials refused to be interviewed by @entity135			1

but after the tournament was over , they were turned loose			2
police refused to speak with @entity135 for this report			1
" they are n't worried about these children growing up in a healthy environment , with jobs and housing , health and education , " she says			0
