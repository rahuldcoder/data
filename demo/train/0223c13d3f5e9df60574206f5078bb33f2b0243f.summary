@entity0 once said that we can understand some parts of nature and the universe , but we ca n't comprehend them			0
for instance , take the fact that in the next 12 years , we 're projected to add another billion people			1
since a billion seconds equal 31.7 years , at the rate people are arriving , we ca n't even count them			1
or that the @entity11 now says that if we want to stay below a 2 - degree @entity14 ( 3.6 - degree @entity13 ) increase in average global temperature , we ca n't emit any more carbon dioxide than what 's released by burning 1 trillion tons of carbon			1
but we 've already used more than half our allotment			0
there 's a direct link between those two hard - to - grasp figures -- the more humans , the more carbon			1
every mile we drive , ours cars emit about a pound of carbon dioxide			2
the average @entity30 driver clocks 12,000 miles per year , pushing six tons of carbon out of his auto 's tailpipe			2
the quarter - billion cars in the @entity30 expel 150 million tons a year			1
in the whole world , there are now well over 1 billion cars			1
those numbers are mind - boggling , even before we add the exhaust from our industries , power plants , and home heating and cooling			1
no , we ca n't easily comprehend the sheer scale of the problem , let alone imagine what we can do about it			0
but maybe this helps to frame it			0
according to the @entity54 , to stay on the safe side of a 2 - degree @entity14 increase , we 'd have to go back to the amount we were expelling in 1990 -- and then cut that in half			1
how might we possibly do that ? it will depend on how wisely we address the matter of those billion new humans			2
here are four ways to cut greenhouse gases , from the most unlikely to the most plausible : the first is to trap them before they float skyward and start acting like glass in a greenhouse			1
this is possible -- theoretically			0
we know how to capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks ( though not from all those cars )			2
we 'd then have to dig deep holes to pump it underground and somehow keep it there			0
one way is to inject the gas into underground saline aquifers , turning their contents into salty carbonic acid , which would then react with surrounding rocks until the carbon dioxide becomes entombed in solid carbonates			2
that 's very neat but very expensive			0
the only attempt in the @entity30 , in @entity84 , was abandoned in 2011 by @entity85 because it would have cost two - thirds of $ 1 billion , even with the @entity86 footing half the bill			1
realistically , we 'll never afford this -- and we 're one of the rich countries			0
imagine the rest of the world doing it			2
the second possibility is finding new ways to produce clean energy			0
we must keep trying , but so far we ca n't concentrate enough diffuse sunlight or intermittent wind to run all our cities and factories ( and it 's hard to hang solar panels or wind turbines on cars )			0
also , a 2012 paper in @entity105 by former @entity107 chief technology officer @entity106 and @entity109 physicist @entity108 showed that the carbon debt incurred by construction of renewable energy plants , including mining their materials , takes decades to amortize before their energy is truly emission - free			1
and exotic methods such as controlled nuclear fusion , which powers the sun 's core , are enticing but perpetually decades away			0
third , we can use incentives such as carbon taxes and moral persuasion to bring down energy consumption			2
again , these help , and must be encouraged			0
although a number of countries and some @entity30 states have passed carbon taxes , consumption is exceedingly hard to control in a world where , for example , even the world 's poor masses , increasingly living in cities , manage to get cell phones			1
whether the power is pirated or not , they plug in their chargers nightly			0
despite all our best efforts to conserve and consume less , global carbon emissions reached a record high in 2012 , and keep climbing			1
@entity144 , however , if we ca n't control consumption , we can control the number of consumers			2
this is technology we already have , and it 's cheap			0
every woman , everywhere , could have contraception			2
most of us would find coercive government limits on child bearing abhorrent			0
but giving women access to contraception and to education makes draconian edicts unnecessary			1
an educated woman has an interesting and useful contribution to make to her family and her society			0
since she ca n't easily do that with seven children hanging on her skirts , most women who get through secondary school want two children or fewer			0
providing access to contraception and educating women may be the fastest path to giving our planet a break			1
in september , the @entity11 presented compelling evidence that seas are rising faster than ever in human history			0
the last time there was this much carbon in the atmosphere , at least 3 million years ago , oceans were 30 to 100 feet higher			1
much of the world 's most widely consumed foodstuff , rice , is grown near sea level , and the cost of protecting it with coastal dikes would be astronomical			0
this month , a team of @entity191 climate modelers added in the journal nature that in just seven years the tropics will be experiencing average temperatures unprecedented in recorded history -- and within a generation , so will the entire planet , unless we stabilize greenhouse gases in the next 20 years			1
population management ca n't do it all ; we need a full - court press on all fronts			2
but if we want a secure future , we need to start with the fastest , most affordable way we know to limit carbon emissions : by bringing fewer emitters into the world .			1

@entity210 : in the next 12 years , world is expected to add another billion people
we have to cut greenhouse gases to stay on safe side of a 2 - degree @entity14 limit , he says
@entity210 says the fastest and easiest way to limit carbon emissions is population control
@entity210 : we need to educate women and give them access to contraception
