a @entity1 judge tuesday rejected claims by former @entity4 chief @entity3 that a civil lawsuit against him should be dismissed because he was protected by diplomatic immunity			1
@entity9 @entity8 @entity7 denied a motion by @entity3 's lawyers to dismiss the lawsuit , which was filed by a hotel maid who accused him of sexual assault last year			1
a lawyer for the maid , @entity17 , said his client was pleased with the decision			0
" we are extremely pleased with judge @entity7 's well - reasoned and articulate decision recognizing that @entity3 is not entitled to immunity , " said attorney @entity20			1
" we have said all along that @entity3 's desperate plea for immunity was a tactic designed to delay these proceedings and we now look forward to holding him accountable for the brutal sexual assault that he committed			2
" @entity3 headed the @entity4 , an international organization of 187 member - states with headquarters in @entity32			1
the @entity4 provides loans to countries that are suffering economic difficulties			2
he resigned his position soon after his arrest by @entity1 police in may 2011 , when he was charged with criminally assaulting a housekeeper in a @entity41 hotel suite			1
@entity17 accused @entity3 of raping her when she entered his suite to clean it			2
police subsequently removed him from an @entity44 flight that was about to depart @entity1 's @entity45 and jailed him before his arraignment in criminal court			1
@entity3 's attorneys later said a consensual sexual encounter did take place with the maid but there was no force involved			2
the arrest of such a high - profile international political figure who was preparing a presidential run in his native @entity59 sparked worldwide media interest			0
but the criminal case against @entity3 was later dropped by @entity1 prosecutors , because of credibility issues they cited in @entity17 's account			1
" at the end of the day , they did something very courageous by dismissing the case , " one of his lawyers , @entity67 , told @entity69 's @entity68 monday night			0
" it took a lot of guts to do that			0
it was the right decision			0
that case was fed by a media frenzy unlike any i 've seen			0
" in august , @entity17 's lawyers served @entity3 with a civil suit seeking damages stemming from the alleged assault in the hotel			1
@entity3 's lawyers did not invoke his immunity from prosecution during the criminal case			1
@entity20 ridiculed the fact that they would invoke it in the civil case , but not the criminal case , as " piecemeal immunity			1
" but @entity3 attorney @entity95 countered that his client was eager to assert his innocence in the criminal proceedings , so he did n't invoke whatever immunity he enjoyed as @entity4 chief			1
in his decision , the judge wrote that " mr. @entity3 can not eschew immunity in an effort to clear his name only to embrace it now in an effort to deny ms. @entity17 the opportunity to clear hers			2
" in the months following @entity17 's accusation last year , other allegations surfaced			0
@entity112 , a @entity113 member of the @entity59 parliament , said @entity3 had attacked her daughter			0
a complaint was filed , alleging a 2002 attack , though it could not be pursued because the statute of limitations had expired			0
currently , @entity3 faces another legal battle -- this time centering on an investigation into a high - profile prostitution network operating out of luxury hotels in the @entity59 city of @entity125			0
@entity3 has been formally warned by @entity59 authorities that he is under investigation for " aggravated pimping , " and has been released on 100,000 - euro bail			0
he has pushed back against the accusations , saying he did not know young women at parties he attended were being paid for sex .			0
