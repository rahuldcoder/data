@entity0 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 said sunday that @entity4 will support military intervention in @entity6 by the @entity3 and its partners			1
" they have supported the strike and they support taking action , " @entity2 said after a long meeting of @entity10 ministers originally called to discuss the @entity12 peace initiative			2
" they believe that it 's very important to do that			0
" @entity2 told reporters he had a very good side meeting with @entity4 foreign minister @entity22 , and @entity4 was one of the countries to sign on to a statement condemning the reported use of chemical weapons last month by the @entity6 military against rebels			1
@entity4 is a diplomatic heavyweight in the @entity10 world but has n't publicly called for an international military reprisal after the incident			2
with its vast air force and bases , @entity4 could offer a lot of resources to @entity39 militaries			0
but it 's not expected to participate directly in any attack on @entity6 , because that would be likely to inflame a widespread @entity43 antipathy against @entity39 military forces intruding into @entity46 affairs			1
@entity2 also said the @entity10 ministers unanimously condemned the august 21 incident			0
" as we discussed today , all of us agreed -- not one dissenter -- that ( @entity6 president @entity51 ) @entity53 's deplorable use of chemical weapons -- which we know killed hundreds of innocent people , including at least 426 children on this occasion , this one occasion -- this crosses an international , global red line , " he said			1
he said the foreign ministers discussed the " possible and necessary measures " needed to deter @entity53 from using chemical weapons again			0
@entity2 said a " number of countries immediately signed on " to an agreement reached by 12 countries on the side at the recent @entity71 summit			0
and while he named @entity4 as one of those nations , he said the others that had agreed to help would make their announcements in the next day			0
the statement called for a " strong international response " and " supports efforts undertaken by the @entity3 and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons			1
" it did not expressly endorse military action , although @entity3 officials said the nations who signed it interpreted the statement as tacit support for strikes			1
the @entity6 government has denied being behind chemical weapons attacks , which it blames on rebels			1
@entity98 on sunday denied again he had anything to do with the use of chemical agents , @entity3 journalist @entity97 reported			1
the @entity103 anchor and @entity105 " @entity106 " co-host said @entity53 told him during an interview to be broadcast monday that @entity6 was prepared to retaliate if there was a military strike by the @entity3 and its partners			1
" it does n't surprise us that someone who would kill thousands of his own people , including hundreds of children , with poison gas would also lie about it , " a spokeswoman for the @entity112 , @entity113 , said			0
@entity98 's rare interview with @entity3 media comes as @entity3 president @entity123 lobbies @entity124 and the country to support military action			1
@entity124 officially returns to @entity127 monday after a monthlong summer recess to debate and vote on a resolution giving @entity123 the authorization to take military action			2
the president will go to @entity135 on tuesday and make his case to @entity137 , a @entity133 leadership aide said sunday			1
@entity123 will also address the nation on @entity6 tuesday at 9 p.m. et from the @entity139			1
videos that purport to show the results of a chemical weapons attack are part of a @entity139 campaign to inform @entity124 about the nature of the incident , @entity2 said			0
" the reason for this is to make sure everybody understands what is at stake , " he said			0
" those videos make it clear to people that these are real human beings , real children , parents being affected in ways that are unacceptable to anybody , anywhere , by any standard			0
" he said a vast majority of the members are undecided as to how they will vote on authorizing force against @entity6			2
@entity166 foreign minister @entity165 appeared at the news conference with @entity2			2
" @entity166 is currently studying with its friends and the @entity170 what it could provide in order to protect the @entity6 people , " he said , according to a translator			1
@entity2 met later with @entity175 foreign secretary @entity174 in @entity176 on sunday			0
@entity175 's @entity177 has ruled out getting militarily involved in @entity6 , but prime minister @entity178 has pledged to continue to push for a tough response against the @entity53 regime			2
@entity2 's efforts with @entity183 allies paralleled those of his boss , @entity123 , who tried to rally members of the @entity71 in @entity187 , @entity188 , last week			2
@entity123 met with his @entity188 counterpart , president @entity189 , on the sidelines of the @entity187 summit friday			1
