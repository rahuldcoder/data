-- @entity2 's rebel leaders claimed monday they had captured three of @entity5 's sons , including @entity6 , who is wanted on war crimes charges by the @entity8			1
but shortly afterwards , @entity6 appeared in public in @entity10 , where he spoke to reporters -- raising serious questions about the reliability of the rebels ' account of events			1
a day later it remains unclear whether @entity6 was ever in rebel hands , while another @entity5 son , @entity19 , reportedly escaped from rebel custody			1
it is also uncertain whether @entity22 , the third son the rebels claimed to have captured , was in their custody either			2
so how much does this dent the credibility of rebels ? and can the @entity2 people and the international community put their faith in the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) to lead the nation if the @entity5 regime falls ? observers say the reported arrest -- and prompt reappearance -- of @entity6 are at the least an embarrassing distraction for the rebels as they seek to take control of the @entity2 capital , @entity10			1
the @entity8 , whose chief prosecutor told @entity0 monday it had been talking to the rebels about transferring @entity6 to its custody , by tuesday was insisting it had never confirmed his capture , while @entity47 diplomats faced questions over their wisdom in backing the rebel leadership			1
professor @entity51 , director of the @entity52 at the @entity53 , told @entity0 he did not believe the rebels had intended to mislead the wider world over the arrest of @entity6 , seen as his father 's heir apparent			1
but , he said , the confusion was of great concern because it betrayed a lack of cohesion and competence in the @entity31 's leadership and exposed the group 's structural weakness			1
rebel groups and militias were acting independently rather than as a unified military force , he said , and with that came a risk that the rebel assault would disintegrate into urban warfare and civil strife			2
he said the rebel leadership needed to " up its game " and could not repeat the lack of openness shown when the rebel government 's military commander , gen @entity78 , died in murky circumstances in @entity81 last month			1
" the lack of transparency raises serious questions			0
this is a de facto government -- they must get it			0
this is not amateurs ' time , " he said			0
" they can not afford to really make so many mistakes because once they lose their credibility , it 's very difficult to repair			2
" @entity96 , minister of information for the @entity31 , acknowledged that the situation over the reported capture of @entity99 was confusing			0
" we admit our communications was not clear , " he told @entity0 , saying it had been representatives in @entity81 who stated @entity6 was under arrest , rather than the prime minister			2
the rebels did not know if @entity6 had been arrested and escaped , he said , so they would have to confirm what happened with the leaders engaged in the fighting in @entity10			1
but , he said , confusion like this occurred in conflict situations , adding that the rebel forces were entering a big city with many different centers of operation			2
@entity115 , the @entity116 ambassador to the @entity117 , said tuesday that the rebels had the confidence of the @entity116 government despite the conflicting information over monday 's arrests			1
" we have definitely found them to be credible and reliable interlocutors , " she told @entity0 's @entity123 from @entity124 , saying the @entity116 had been in close contact with the leadership in @entity81 , the rebels ' eastern base			1
@entity130 joined @entity131 and other @entity47 powers in recognizing the @entity31 last month as the legitimate governing authority in @entity2 , adding to the pressure on @entity5 to relinquish power to the rebels			1
" clearly in a situation as fluid as this that is evolving rapidly , there 's going to be confusion , there 's going to be misinformation , and those that are on the ground in @entity10 may or may not be in full and timely communication with the leadership outside of @entity10 , " @entity137 said			1
" generally speaking , we 've found in all of our engagements with the ( @entity31 ) that their leadership is reliable , principled and is working to do the right things			0
" @entity153 , a lawyer who negotiated the release in @entity155 two years ago of @entity156 , the @entity2 convicted of blowing up a @entity158 flight over @entity159 , echoed the view that it was unfair to judge the rebels as unreliable on the basis of miscommunications on the ground in @entity10			1
" we have to focus on the bigger picture now and see what the council does next , " he told @entity0			0
@entity153 believes the @entity31 should focus on getting food and medical supplies to the people in areas of @entity2 no longer under @entity5 's control , in order to demonstrate that life will be better under a new government			1
and in order to reassure their allies in the @entity178 , the @entity31 must ensure law and order are established in the areas liberated from @entity5 's forces , he said			1
police and security forces should be retrained so they understand they exist to serve the people rather than the regime , he added			0
the specter of @entity189 's descent into violence and sectarian strife after the fall of @entity193 hang over @entity2 -- and @entity153 sees the international community as having a key role to play in ensuring history is not repeated			0
" the @entity116 , @entity131 , @entity197 and others should work now with practical steps to make sure that @entity2 feel that their country has become a better place , " he said			2
" this is not @entity189			0
" the credibility of a new government will rely on its swift formation and the inclusion of respected members of different communities , tribes , professions and religious groups , he said , to act as " trustees of the revolution and its values			0
" @entity215 , director of @entity216 for the @entity217 at the @entity218 , said the rebels were trying to learn from their mistakes -- and the misfortunes of other countries such as @entity189 -- in order to keep the trust of their international partners			0
speaking from @entity227 , on his way to @entity10 , @entity215 told @entity0 he believed the critical issue was one of transparency , so that the rebels could avoid the kind of damaging conflicting accounts that emerged over the death of @entity78			2
and however the @entity31 does , he believes the resulting government will be better than the corrupt regime headed by @entity5 over the past four decades			2
" it 's a huge task but to be honest they are the best that we have in @entity2 at the moment , " he said			0
@entity51 agrees that it would be wrong to judge the @entity31 too harshly for a handful of errors in its early days			0
not only is the movement less than a year old , he pointed out , but it is made up of many disparate ideological , social , regional and tribal groups that have yet to fully consolidate into institutions			0
@entity51 believes a functioning and inclusive government will develop given time , provided peace can be restored in @entity2 and that the @entity31 can translate its rhetoric into concrete policies			0
" if i were to gamble , i would gamble on the rebels really rising to the occasion , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity257 contributed to this report .			0
