-- admirers of the late @entity3 president @entity2 lined @entity5 's famous @entity4 wednesday as his coffin was moved to @entity7 ahead of his state funeral friday			1
@entity2 , who helped bring down communism in @entity11 's 1989 @entity10 , died sunday , aged 75			1
a fiercely independent thinker with a wry , playful sense of humor , @entity2 became president of @entity11 after the fall of the @entity18 - backed regime , and the first president of the @entity3 when it split peacefully from @entity21 three years later			1
the long - time chain smoker , whose health was permanently damaged by time in prison under the @entity26 , died peacefully in his sleep sunday , his spokeswoman @entity22 said			2
people poured into the streets of @entity5 with candles and flowers in memory of him that night			0
his longtime friend and translator @entity34 remembered @entity2 as " a very shy and gentle man with a will of steel , who was fearless when confronting a regime that tried , relentlessly , to crush his spirit			2
" @entity2 , an absurdist playwright turned political activist , spent four and a half years in prison for opposing @entity11 's communist government before emerging as a leader of the @entity10			1
a deeply serious thinker given to long , rambling statements in presidential speeches and conversation , @entity2 also had an impish sense of humor , reportedly whizzing through the long corridors of @entity7 on a scooter after becoming president			2
a perennial contender for the @entity55 , @entity2 never won , but he remained active in anti-communist causes from @entity57 to @entity58 until his death			2
he urged @entity58 authorities to release dissident @entity61 , whose charter 08 call for greater political freedom in @entity58 was inspired by @entity11 's @entity64			1
@entity2 and other @entity3 dissidents attempted to deliver a letter to the @entity58 embassy in january 2010 , before @entity61 won the @entity55 , but they found the doors closed and no one to receive it			2
it was an absurd scene that could have come out of one of the plays he wrote in the 1960s , poking fun at the @entity77 - backed authorities who ruled his country at the time			0
theater proved a potent weapon against @entity11 's communist rulers , who stepped down without a shot being fired in the weeks after the @entity86 fell , signaling the defeat of the region 's authoritarian @entity18 - backed regimes			1
@entity2 was unanimously elected president by the last communist - run parliament of @entity11 22 years ago this month			1
his country joined @entity92 and the @entity93 under his stewardship , but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency , including his effort to keep @entity11 together			0
@entity100 president @entity99 said he was " was inspired by his words and leadership			0
... @entity2 was a friend to @entity100 and to all who strive for freedom and dignity , and his words will echo through the ages			0
" but speaking to to @entity0 's @entity108 in march , @entity2 expressed more modest wishes for how history would remember him			1
" i would be glad if it was felt that i have done something generally useful , " he said			0
" i do n't care much about personal fame or popularity			0
i would be satisfied with the feeling that i had a chance to help with something in general , something good			0
that history gave me that chance			0
