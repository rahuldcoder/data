-- i once stayed at a youth hostel in @entity3 called @entity4 in @entity5			2
which sounds quite pleasant until you realize that , apparently , heaven is cold and damp and completely infested with bedbugs			2
i guess that 's the part they do n't tell you in sunday school			2
" no , no. it 's great			2
" but there were none of those			2
something was rotten in the state of @entity25			1
the next day , bitten and disgusted , i literally ran to catch a train to @entity28 and have n't had pleasant thoughts about that country since			2
this was back in 2003			0
the tortured memories persist and still haunt my dreams			0
which is why , the other day , almost eleven years later , i was delighted to learn that the @entity35 finally invaded @entity25 , set it on fire , and raised the @entity35 flag			1
there 's a wildly popular computer game called " @entity42 " where , as best i understand it , players build highly imaginative environments and constructions using 3d cubes			1
it 's sort of like a modern , digital - version of @entity50 , but without the risk of waking up the neighbors when you step barefoot on a wayward block			1
" @entity55 , i think @entity57 next door is constipated again			0
" " mark it on the chart , @entity60			0
" now , i 've never actually played this game because i 'm a grown man with far more important things to do like tweeting and running my pretend fantasy football sports dynasty			1
so , to the millions of fine people who play " @entity42 , " i sincerely apologize for oversimplifying your beloved game			1
it 's all just too complicated , for i have six functioning brain cells , and five of them are dedicated to breathing and blinking			0
but , from what i can tell , part of the fun in " @entity42 " is creating these new virtual worlds and exploring those of others			1
and it 's also a way to re-imagine worlds that already exist			0
so , the @entity83 government sanctioned the creation of a replica version of their country within " @entity42 " to use as a progressive teaching tool for schoolchildren , educating them about @entity25 's geography			1
really , it was a wonderfully creative and virtuous idea			0
thus , cyber vandals promptly decided to blow it up			1
somehow , these vandals were able to infiltrate virtual @entity25 while sneaking in virtual dynamite , at which point they virtually demolished parts of virtual @entity3			1
what 's interesting is that the use of this virtual dynamite was actually banned on the @entity83 server			1
but the ever - cunning vandals discovered they could sneak it in inside a virtual mining cart			1
which is both amazing and ridiculous			0
. that it should come to this			0
but through their virtual sneak attack invasion , the vandals proudly constructed virtual @entity35 flags all over town , and built virtual signs reading : @entity35			1
( forgive me for a moment as i cue some @entity113 and dab these red , white , and blue tears of pride rolling down my cheeks			0
) initially , it was believed that the virtual damage was virtually catostraphic and virtually widespread			2
however , @entity119 , an actual spokesperson from the @entity120 , explained to the @entity121 , " only a minor area was destroyed			0
" there was no official word on whether or not a virtual @entity126 youth hostel was annihilated in the process			2
i guess a man can dream			0
though the @entity120 was quickly able to fully " repair " the " destruction , " there was no fixing the psychological damage			0
soon after the attack , images appeared on a " @entity42 " forum , and @entity25 's defeat had officially gone public			1
now , understand that i 'm not an outwardly patriotic individual			0
but , despite the fact that -- all kidding aside -- @entity25 really is a beautiful country with incredibly happy , intelligent , and peaceful citizens , i have to admit that , upon reading about this i felt a rather large twinge of @entity35 pride			1
the whole thing was just so absurd and wonderfully @entity35			1
oh , that it should come to this			0
follow @ @entity146 on @entity147 .			0

a virtual version of @entity25 was created in the " @entity42 " game
" cyber vandals " snuck into virtual @entity25 , set off virtual dynamite and raised @entity35 flags
@entity25 has since been repaired
