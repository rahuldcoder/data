every few weeks , right when one extremist group is dominating the news with threats of attacks , along resurfaces another with a different , more harrowing claim			2
over the weekend , @entity8 released a video urging its sympathizers to attack malls in the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
the same day , @entity15 had one showing its members parading caged captives down the streets of @entity19 , the latest in its string of atrocious videos			2
then there 's the ever - present threat of @entity24 , the brutality of the @entity26 and the looming @entity27			2

what is it ? : an extremist group with branches in the @entity87 and @entity68			1

" it has attacked @entity97 nations , military facilities , even other @entity43 sects it considers too liberal			2

its growing list of admirers include the @entity8			1
what is it ? : a terror group based in @entity143			1
