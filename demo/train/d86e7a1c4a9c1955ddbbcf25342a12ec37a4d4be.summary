-- @entity1 has gotten plenty of attention in 2013 , but that does n't mean she 's run out of things to say			1
in a recent interview with the @entity8 , the year 's resident bad girl discussed everything from the issue of race to whether she pressured teen heartthrob @entity12 to smoke weed			1
here are five interesting things we learned from the interview : 1			2
she 's looking forward to the next @entity1 -- whoever that may be			1
@entity1 is fully aware that @entity19 has a short attention span , even when it comes to celebs who like to stir the pot. " even when i hear that -- that someone , two years from now , is going to be the next kind of provocateur -- like , i ca n't wait to collab with whoever the hell that is , you know , " she told the @entity8			1
" i 'm like , whoever that is , i 'm going to ride that wave			2
it 's rock ' n ' roll , people ! the singer would like to remind people that she 's a musician and they sometimes are edgy			2
the now 21 - year - old former teen star says she has gone from " people just thinking i was , like , a baby to people thinking i 'm this , like , sex freak that really just pops molly and does lines all day			0
" " it 's like , ' has anyone ever heard of rock ' n ' roll ? ' " @entity1 said			1
" there 's a sex scene in pretty much every single movie , and they go , ' well , that 's a character			0
' well , that 's a character			0
i do n't really dress as a teddy bear and , like , twerk on @entity50 , you know ? " 3			1
other stars do n't want to be associated with her			1
of course stars often hang out with other equally famous people , but @entity1 said she thinks some celebs are afraid of being associated with her			1
she does n't have a ton of famous friends , she said , but she sometimes gets other celebs to cut loose -- only to quickly rein it back in for fear of the repercussions			1
" i 'll get someone to , like , flash me , and they 'll be , like , ' you have to delete it ! ' i had to do that when i was 14 or 15 , but even then i did n't care , " she said			2
" like , if someone was videoing me ripping a bong , i did n't care , so it 's just funny to me			2
i 'm like : ' dude , you 're 30			0
like , why ca n't someone see a picture of your ( breasts ) ? ' " 4			2
call her racist all you want ; she knows the truth			0
some people called @entity1 's controversial performance at the 2013 @entity80 racist			1
she thought , " how do i win ? if i have white dancers , then i 'm racist			0
if i have black girl dancers , then i 'm racist			0
" not only does she know she 's not a racist , she said , but the criticism has not changed her thinking about race			0
just like her 80 - year - old grandmother never thought to see an @entity89 - @entity19 president in her lifetime , @entity1 said , she knows that people 's thinking will continue to evolve			1
" i really thought about it a lot when @entity95 passed away , because i could n't even imagine living this life and seeing how much it 's changed , " she said			2
" so , you know , i look forward to when i 'm older , my kids being like , ' what do you mean people ever even talked about what color your dancers were ? ' " 5			0
she longs for the day rising star @entity104 can be free			0
if anyone knows about the confines of being a star to the masses of teens and tweens , it 's @entity1			1
that 's why she says she would like to see singer and @entity114 star @entity104 be able to be a bit edgier			0
@entity116 has had a big year , with top 40 hits and tons of exposure , but no way is she walking on the wild side like @entity1			1
" she 's trying , " @entity1 said			1
" i see her wearing the shorter things			0
she comes in , and she goes , ' this made me feel like you			0
' and i 'm like , ' that was like my sixth - grade prom dress			0
