statins did not help protect against alzheimer 's disease in a study released in 2008			1
cholesterol - lowering drugs called statins are often hailed as " wonder drugs			1
" but a study published in the january 2008 issue of the journal @entity8 says they do n't protect the brain against alzheimer 's disease			1
what is @entity12 's ? dr. @entity13 , @entity14 chief medical correspondent : alzheimer 's disease is a progressive , neurodegenerative disease characterized in the brain by abnormal clumps ( amyloid plaques ) and tangled bundles of fibers ( neurofibrillary tangles ) made up of misplaced proteins			1
these plaques and tangles destroy cognition , personality and the ability to function			1
sometimes forgetfulness and loss of concentration are confused with normal aging , the single biggest risk factor for @entity12 's disease			1
but an autopsy is always going to give you a definitive measure of the disease			1
how was the study done ? @entity13 : fairly large observational study looked at some 900 members of the clergy -- priests and nuns			1
some were taking statins , some not			2
not only did patients undergo cognitive tests for 12 years , but they also agreed to a brain autopsy when they died			2
the conclusion here , supported by these autopsies , is that statins did not help protect against alzheimer 's disease , a finding somewhat contrary to the prevailing wisdom in this area of @entity12 's research			2
we spoke to the head of @entity12 's research at @entity57			1
he said that first , this is a population of nuns and priests -- would it be different in folks who take statins but also smoke and drink ? maybe			2
he also said , when you get right down to it , the numbers of folks in the study that both took statins and had autopsies is pretty small			1
still , he said he knows these researchers well and they are good , just not the last word			1
and of course , there 's the compelling question : why would statins affect alzheimer 's disease ? there are a few schools of thought about the mechanism : some think statins cross the blood - brain barrier , decreasing cholesterol levels and amyloid levels			2
others think they work by lowering overall inflammation in the body			2
what about other benefits of statins ? does this undermine their " wonder drug " status ? while this study clearly questions the neuroprotective effects against dementia and alzheimer 's disease , scientists believe they are just beginning to uncover potential new benefits of statins			1
the most immediately promising benefit of statins appears to be their anti-inflammatory properties , which help stabilize the lining of blood vessels			2
this has potentially far - reaching effects , from the brain and heart to blood vessels and organs throughout the body			0
other benefits of statins may include prevention of arthritis and bone fractures , prevention of colon cancer and protection of the kidneys			0
but we should note , while tolerated well by most people , they do have side effects , including two potentially serious ones : liver damage : occasionally , statin use causes an increase in liver enzymes and may cause liver damage			0
muscle problems : statins may cause muscle pain and tenderness ( statin myopathy )			0
also , there are some gastrointestinal issues , including nausea , diarrhea and constipation			0
are there ways other than statins to lower cholesterol ? the simple b vitamin niacin raises good cholesterol , but there 's an interesting side effect : some forms of niacin , especially in high doses -- 1,000 milligrams or more -- do cause temporary flushing of the skin			0
while annoying , flushing is not harmful			0
@entity153 can counteract this flushing effect			0
versions of niacin with reduced flushing effects also are available by prescription			0
also , studies have shown exercise in general , especially in overweight people , can improve hdl levels			0
there is some evidence that strength - training exercises that build muscle mass can also improve hdl			0
saturated fats are one of the biggest contributors to cholesterol in the body			0
a diet high in saturated fat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol -- so knock that off !			0

bottom line : *experts* at the @entity57 say this study is not the last word on the subject .
