the president told host @entity9 that he was optimistic something will be worked out to keep tax rates from rising on tuesday -- but if not , his first piece of legislation for the next @entity14 will be a bill to reduce tax rates on most @entity17			1
@entity1 slams @entity19 ' priority ' as fiscal cliff hours away the president also spoke about his second term and what he wants to accomplish			1
here are highlights of what he said : gun control after the @entity26 killings " something fundamental in @entity17 has to change , " said @entity1 , who visited on december 16 with families of victims of the @entity26 , @entity29 , school shootings			1
the president said sunday he will put forth a proposal next year to change firearm laws			1
among the things the legislation will address are assault - style rifles , high - capacity ammunition magazines and background checks on all firearm sales			2
his comments echoed those made five days after the shootings in @entity26 , where a gunman killed his mother at home , then 20 children and six adults at an elementary school			0
@entity1 said he hopes that the @entity26 killings spur @entity17 to take action and not let the shootings feel like " one of those routine episodes , " the emotions of which fade with memory			1
" " it certainly wo n't feel like that to me			0
this is something that , you know , that was the worst day of my presidency , " he said			0
the president said he wanted to listen to all the parties involved in the gun control debate but was skeptical about the @entity68 's call to put armed guards in every school as the only solution			1
@entity1 said december 19 that a task force led by vice president @entity73 will have legislative recommendations in january			1
@entity76 attack @entity1 said the security failures that led to the deaths of four @entity17 at the @entity17 @entity79 in @entity76 , @entity80 , were " severe , " but he blamed human mistakes			1
" there was just some sloppiness -- not intentional -- in terms of how we secure embassies in areas where you essentially do n't have governments that have a lot of capacity to protect those embassies , " he said			2
the @entity93 will implement all of the 29 recommendations by a review board headed by veteran diplomat @entity96			0
the @entity97 also has some " very good leads " into who carried out the september attack that killed @entity17 ambassador @entity101 and three others , @entity1 said			1
among the recommendations in the report sent to secretary of state @entity105 were strengthening security , adding fire - safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high - threat areas			1
" but we 'll try to do more than that , " @entity1 said			2
@entity113 ambassador @entity112 the president said verbal attacks on @entity116 for her comments on the @entity76 investigation were " puzzling			0
" " of all the people in my national security team , she probably had the least to do with anything that happened in @entity76 , " he said			0
@entity116 said on sunday news programs in the days following the attack that it was the result of a protest against an online @entity127 film			0
she was heavily criticized for those statements , to the point that she withdrew her name from consideration as the next secretary of state to avoid what she called a " lengthy , disruptive , and costly " confirmation process			0
critics said @entity116 's comments were out of line with the true intelligence about the incident and were an attempt by the administration to avoid tying it to terrorism			0
" most @entity17 recognize that these were largely politically motivated attacks as opposed to being justified , " @entity1 said			2
next secretary of defense he has yet to make a decision as to who to nominate for secretary of defense , @entity1 said			1
sources have said they think the president will pick @entity150 , a @entity19 , who has met with controversy since his name has been connected with the position			1
gay rights groups , which were strong supporters of @entity1 's election campaigns , have hit @entity157 for questioning in 1998 whether a nominee for an ambassadorship was suitable because he was " openly , aggressively gay			2
" @entity1 , without calling @entity157 his preferred candidate for the job , said : " i 've served with @entity150 ( in the @entity162 )			1
he is somebody who has done extraordinary work			0
" @entity157 has apologized for those comments , @entity1 said			2
he added that he did n't see anything in @entity157 's political record that disqualified him as a potential nominee			0
@entity157 currently is the co-chairman of the president 's @entity169			0
@entity171 , who has been secretary of defense since july 2011 , has indicated he wants to return to private life next year			1
four issues for the next term when asked about his priorities for the next four years , @entity1 listed immigration , the economy , energy and debt reduction			1
he will introduce legislation to fix a broken immigration system in 2013 , he said			1
" we have talked about it long enough , " he said			0
" we know how we can fix it			0
" @entity1 also wants to fix @entity17 's infrastructure			2
" if we are putting people back to work , rebuilding our roads , our bridges , our schools , in part paid for by some of these broader long - term deficit reduction measures that need to take place , that will grow our economy , " he said and he wants to increase further the amount of energy , especially green energy , that @entity17 produces			0
" we are producing more energy and @entity17 can become an energy exporter			0
( the question is ) how do we do that in a way that also deals with the environmental challenges that we also have at the same time , " @entity1 said			2
but the most pressing quandary is the fiscal cliff			0
" it is going to be very hard for the economy to sustain its current growth trends if suddenly we have a huge bite taken of the average @entity17 's paycheck , " he said .			0
