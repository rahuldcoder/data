-- joyful supporters cheered as president @entity2 stepped out to speak at his victory party in @entity4 in the early hours of wednesday , thanking them and millions of voters for allowing him another four years to lead the nation forward			1
" tonight , in this election , you , the @entity9 people , reminded us that while our road has been hard , while our journey has been long , we have picked ourselves up , we have fought our way back , and we know in our hearts that for the @entity9 , the best is yet to come , " he told them			0
when @entity2 finished , the first family and vice president @entity17 and his family joined him onstage in a celebration of waves and hugs amid a blizzard of confetti			2
but despite the happiness and relief , the mood was perhaps more subdued than that experienced by those who were present for the wild celebrations four years earlier in @entity30			1
nearly everyone in the room had worked to get the president re-elected , either making phone calls or knocking on doors , and as they eagerly awaited his remarks early wednesday morning there seemed to be less of the dreamy optimism that surrounded the 2008 campaign			1
those seated in the bleachers energetically waved tiny @entity9 flags , and those on the floor calmly mingled , cheering sporadically whenever networks called a state for the president			0
but gone were the chants of " yes we can , " replaced instead with chants of " four more years , " and the president 's re-election message was echoed in conversations throughout the convention hall -- there 's still more work to do			2
gov. @entity57 's concession speech was played on the monitors flanking the stage , and the crowd cheered as the defeated challenger admitted that " the nation chose another leader			0
" but it also cheered , albeit somewhat begrudgingly , when the president thanked campaign volunteers from both parties , saying , " whether you held an @entity2 sign or a @entity57 sign , you made your voice heard and you made a difference			1
" and when @entity2 talked of sitting down with his former rival " to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward , " there was scattered yet enthusiastic applause at the prospect of bipartisanship			2
after getting their pictures taken or recording some cell phone video , a few members of the audience floated toward the exits to beat the crowds , but the vast majority stayed through to the end			0
in conversations they expressed a conviction that the country is indeed moving in the right direction , but most admitted readily that the change they 'd voted for would require more hard work			0
the president 's final exit from the campaign stage had come more than 24 hours earlier			1
with the imposing @entity100 looming over a soggy crowd that bore near - freezing temperatures in windswept @entity104 , @entity2 made his last major appearance of the 2012 campaign to urge the more than 20,000 supporters to maintain the enthusiasm that first catapulted him from a fresh - faced senator to presidential front - runner nearly five years ago			1
flanked by first lady @entity112 and rock star @entity113 , @entity2 's final bow just before midnight marked at long last the arrival of @entity116 and the end of the president 's last campaign -- 105 rallies after kicking off his re-election effort in @entity122 and @entity123 seven months prior			1
how @entity2 got to 270 electoral votes and when @entity128 touched down in @entity2 's hometown of @entity4 60 minutes later , the president 's role as a candidate was all but done			1
on @entity116 itself , @entity2 largely lay low , as has long been his practice when it comes time for voters to head to the polls			1
that 's not to say the president closed the book on entirely on his re-election effort			0
@entity2 sat for a string of satellite interviews with television stations in battleground states in a final effort to get his message out , including two each in @entity100 , @entity122 and @entity146 -- states the president 's campaign particularly focused on			1
markets in @entity150 and @entity151 also got interviews			0
and in the afternoon , the president sat for an additional six interviews in yet more battleground markets			0
the president also turned up at a campaign field office in @entity4 on tuesday to shake hands with volunteers			1
" i just want to say how grateful @entity112 and i am for all the families , all the communities who have welcomed us , into their homes in some cases , into the neighborhoods , and have in some cases worked so hard on our behalf , " the president said at the stop			2
" the great thing about these campaigns is after all the tv ads and all the fundraising and all the debates and all the electioneering			0
it comes down to this , one day , and these incredible folks who are working so hard , " he said			0
but for all intents and purposes , @entity2 remained largely out of sight tuesday , containing whatever nerves he felt behind closed doors surrounded by friends , family and a circle of advisers who have been with him since the early days of his 2008 presidential race			1
a heavy dose of nostalgia and reflection was in the air , given that whatever the result @entity2 would never run for political office again			2
some of the president 's senior advisers , including @entity199 and @entity200 , were spotted wearing @entity202 fleece jackets monday			0
meanwhile , other veterans of the 2008 campaign , such as speechwriters @entity205 and @entity207 , were also on hand for the president 's final sprint			1
the 2012 campaign in 27 tweets " it 's like the end of a long - running series , and all the characters are coming back , " @entity199 mused			2
perhaps with an eye toward recreating some of 2008 's magic , @entity2 reconvened a game of pickup basketball that he got in the habit of playing every @entity116 during that year 's drawn out primary process			1
senior campaign aide @entity223 said instructions were sent several days ago to @entity225 , the president 's former body man and frequent basketball companion , to organize an election day game			1
the game kicked off shortly after 2 p.m. at the @entity231 facility in downtown @entity4			1
a @entity233 aide said that in addition to @entity225 , " friends and staff " were participating in the game , including education secretary @entity235 and @entity2 friend @entity236			1
@entity239 : five things @entity2 must do " i think it 's safe all rituals will be observed , " said @entity223 , who also noted that the one time the president did n't play basketball on an @entity116 was when he had a surprise loss to @entity244 in the 2008 @entity246 primary			1
" we wo n't make that mistake again , " he joked			0
@entity251 : @entity2 's win wo n't transform @entity9 one thing the president did not do tuesday was visit any additional battleground states , the campaign 's traveling press secretary @entity256 said , even as @entity57 went out to meet and greet voters in @entity122 and @entity259 until polls closed			1
that was a calculated decision not to get in the way of the campaign 's get - out - the - vote efforts in the battleground states , said @entity265 , a senior adviser to the campaign			2
" on @entity116 , the last thing you want to do is take your gotv staff off from getting people out to the polls , " she told @entity0			2
instead , the president was aware his fate was largely out of his hands and instead in those of the thousands of grassroots operatives and volunteers who are charged with getting voters to the polls across the country			0
speaking to a @entity123 crowd saturday night , @entity2 mused that he now felt like a " prop " because there was little left he could do with so few hours remaining until voters issued their final judgment			2
" it 's up to the volunteers , " he told the @entity123 crowd			0
" it 's up to somebody knocking on a door			0
it 's up to somebody making a phone call			0
" share your reaction to the results ultimately , the president spent the majority of his time tuesday simply trying to stay at ease with a close circle that includes the first lady and old friends such as @entity305 and @entity306			0
he also put the finishing touches on two speeches -- one for a victory , and the other for the eventuality that he lost			0
and just as the first wave of results flowed in , the president sat down to dinner with the first lady , his two daughters and mother - in - law -- all of whom flew in from @entity320 earlier in the evening			0
at that final rally in @entity100 on monday night , @entity113 ended his 30 - minute concert with his classic , " in the @entity324 , " crooning , " well , you do n't know where you 're goin ' now , but you know you wo n't be back			1
" it was a fitting end for a president who did n't yet know if he 'd hold on to @entity233 but could be certain his days as a candidate were forever over			0
@entity2 : my vision for @entity9 @entity0 's @entity333 contributed to this report .			2
