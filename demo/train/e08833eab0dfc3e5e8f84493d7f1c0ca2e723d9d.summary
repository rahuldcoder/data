@entity0 -- it could be the find of the century , or something much more suspicious			2
" @entity7 " -- a 13 inch tall pen - and - ink portrait of a @entity9 woman with a @entity11 smile -- sat in a drawer for decades , before being " rediscovered " and attributed as a lost $ 150 million masterpiece by @entity6			1
each year , we 're seeing " priceless " lost art reappearing -- a lost @entity14 , a haul of @entity16 , a stash of picassos and @entity19 -- that transform owners into multi-millionaires overnight			2
today 's booming international art market creates a near - irresistible draw for attic - raiders and flea market - shoppers hoping to win big -- and seductive target for fraudsters and forgers , too			2
currently , the @entity30 @entity29 lists art crime as the world 's third - highest - grossing criminal trade -- only behind drugs and arms dealing			0
here , a lecturer teaching a new class in forgery - catching and the head of science at the @entity42 @entity41 's laboratory explain how new techniques identify ever more cunning forgers and bring true masterpieces to light			1
does it have style ? before a painting ever finds itself in front of the high tech gadgets now boasted by arts scientists , it is likely to face the oldest examination : an examination by a " connoisseur " -- one of a band of art experts whose weighty support can push a painting into contention as a potential masterpiece			0
@entity64 , a world - leading @entity6 scholar , conducted a year - long critical " interrogation " of the @entity71 -- the brushstrokes , composition , and details of the clothes were all scrutinized -- to discover if the portrait bore the hallmarks of the master , or a lesser artist			1
" @entity64 specifically compiled evidence of all the mistakes that @entity6 's forgers had made through the ages , " says dr @entity76 , a @entity77 in @entity78 and @entity79 at @entity80 , teaching a new course on forgeries , @entity83 and the @entity84			1
" he would look for things like a right - handed brush stroke [ @entity6 was left - handed ] , which could happen inadvertently , and would give the forger away , or a failure to layer the paint in the way @entity6 did it			1
go beneath the surface @entity64 found no mistakes			0
increasingly , scientists are developing techniques that allow the critical gaze of connoisseurs to penetrate further -- to " give a new glance to art historians " says @entity105 , ceo of @entity106 , a @entity107 - based firm which worked with @entity64 to uncover the @entity71 's secrets			1
for decades , forensics have employed x-ray and infra - red imaging to see through the surface paint to details hidden below -- often tantalising secrets later painted over			1
the @entity41 , @entity0 , acquired " the @entity117 " in 2004 for Â £ 22m , identifying the portrait as an authentic @entity116			0
back in their high - tech lab , head of science @entity121 explains how infrared imaging found tentative sketching underneath -- typical of the artist plotting ideas for the painting , but unlikely to be seen in a student or forger copying an original			0
@entity132 's " multispectral " 300 megapixel cameras takes this further -- producing a digital scan that cuts through the paint and provide a thinly sliced view of the inside of the painting from surface down to canvas , revealing times a forger slipped up			1
finding none , beliefs mounted that the @entity71 could be the real deal			0
test the materials a renaissance fake painted with modern synthetic pigments would be exposed at once			2
a quick look through a microscope is enough to tell the difference between these 19th century inventions and pigments used in the 15th and 16th centuries			0
but it does n't stop there			0
@entity157 zooms in on a microscopic fleck of paint to show layer - upon - layer of paint and primer which the painter had laid down			2
an angular particle at the base , she explains , is " colorless powdered glass			0
" the team had discovered this base layer on other @entity116 paintings in the collection , but before this , @entity173 says : " there 's no way that a copyist several centuries later would have known that this is how @entity116 prepared his paints			0
" for the @entity71 , too , pigment analysis turned up only substances available during @entity6 's life			1
radiocarbon dating -- a process more commonly used to date prehistoric archaeological finds -- indicated that the parchment was produced between 1440 and 1650			0
" both of those tests , " says @entity76 , " indicated that it could well be by @entity6			1
beating the forgers either of those tests might once have ruled out modern day forgery -- but forgers are keeping up with scientific advances			1
" techniques are improving all the time , and the techniques can be used for good or evil , " laughs @entity76			1
" what if the breakthrough scientifically also helps the forger to make a more perfect forgery ? so it is a race ... it is a race of wits and technique and skill			0
" the @entity41 has confirmed the authenticity of the @entity116 beyond any doubt and it hangs in the halls of the gallery , but testing on the @entity6 continues			2
processes more commonly seen at a murder scene are now used in the attempt to piece together final evidence			0
@entity76 mentions @entity212 , a @entity213 forensic art expert , who attempted to find @entity6 's fingerprints in the @entity71 's paint			1
the controversy seemed settled when @entity212 found a print under layers of paint which matched one from a known @entity6 , but @entity212 's techniques are now under the microscope , after an investigation by the @entity224 suggested he had used them to authenticate other fakes			1
for now , the @entity71 remains in limbo			0
more from @entity228 to watch : meet the ' chameleon ' who blends into other people 's family portraits learn to paint a portrait in 54 seconds with master @entity234 astonishing photo - realistic portraits painted by hand			2

it could be a $ 150m @entity6 or a *worthless* fake : how do we find out ?
secrets revealed by fingerprints in paint , *chemical* tests , and a 300 megapixel camera
new techniques are being created all the time , as forgers learn to beat the tests
