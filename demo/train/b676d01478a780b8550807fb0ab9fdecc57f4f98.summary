-- as @entity1 grapples with a crisis of children on its southern border , another image from another time seems inescapable : that ship full of @entity9 refugees off our shores as @entity12 approached			1
you might have seen the story portrayed in the @entity15 in @entity16			2
it unfolded in 1939 as @entity9 families fleeing from @entity19 took passage to @entity21 on a @entity23 liner , the @entity24			1
while underway , @entity21 decided to deny them entry so they turned toward @entity1 , desperately hoping the @entity28 would show them compassion			1
but the @entity28 political climate had turned hostile toward the growing number of @entity34 immigrants			1
on june 6 , 1939 , their ship hovered off the coast of @entity38 -- only to learn that the @entity28 government refused them entry			1
losing hope , the @entity24 turned back to @entity46 and there , in the months and years that followed , over a third of its passengers perished at @entity19 hands			2
@entity1 has had many noble moments , but that was a moment of shame that left an indelible stain			1
seventy - five years later , we are faced with a new group of desperate people hovering in our midst -- this time children from @entity1 escaping escalating levels of violence few of us can fathom			1
while certainly no @entity19 , the growing humanitarian crisis in their home countries is glaring as rising murder rates for youths are a driving force behind the mass exodus			0
how will we respond this time ? a family secret that changed his life as has been widely reported , the number of unaccompanied children arriving from @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 has increased tenfold since 2011			2
it 's no surprise that the current system -- designed for no more than 8,000 children -- has collapsed under the stress of 40,000 unaccompanied minors since in october			2
by year 's end , our government says , as many as 90,000 may be apprehended -- a tripling of last year 's border arrest figures			0
but just as with the @entity9 refugees on the @entity24 , this influx is not primarily a story of immigrants traveling to @entity1 to seek opportunity and prosperity			1
this is a story of three countries so plagued by gang violence , chaos and poverty that a family would rather pay a " coyote " 18 months of income to take their 14 - year - old daughter on a life - threatening 45 - day , 2,000 - mile journey than have her risk her life at home			0
this is a story of three countries with levels of violence comparable to a war zone			0
@entity74 suffers from the highest murder rate in the world , and @entity72 and @entity73 are in the top five			0
in fact , a civilian is twice as likely to be killed in these three countries as in @entity114 during the height of the war			0
it is also the story of three broken states where the police are infiltrated by street gangs ( some copied on @entity28 models ) and governments -- corrupt from top to bottom -- are helpless in their fight against organized crime			1
and it 's the kids who are most at risk in this story			0
boys are recruited into gangs sometimes before they hit their teenage years			0
girls are forced into nonconsensual relationships with gang members where they are raped , abused and sometimes " disposed " of afterward			0
and any defiance invites violent retaliation and , often , death			0
one immigration rights advocate recalls a mother telling her , " i would rather see my child die on the way to the @entity28 than die on my doorstep			1
" another organization reports a child explaining , " if you stay , you will die , if you leave , you might			0
... either way it 's better to try			0
" what should be done ? we can solve the immediate crisis of children piling up in detention centers			2
@entity157 can -- and should -- pass some version of the president 's $ 3.7 billion emergency spending request			0
we can -- and should -- beef up security at the border , hire more judges to expedite the process , and track down the children who skip their court dates			2
we can -- and should -- provide due process to these kids , seeing who legally qualifies for staying here as refugees from persecution			2
estimates vary on how many will qualify			0
but those calling for mass deportations of the rest need to think long and hard about what sort of fate we are sending these kids back to			2
unless circumstances change , many forced to return to their cities will likely perish			0
they are now in our care			0
are we not morally obligated to prevent the possible deaths and abuses of thousands of these children ? so how do we humanely protect these kids without encouraging new waves of children to undertake highly dangerous journeys and wind up on our already overstressed border ? surely , we as @entity28 are capable of coming up with creative solutions that are compassionate as well as sensible , solutions that tell the world ( and ourselves ) that we still aspire to be good - hearted , noble but pragmatic people			1
three steps come quickly to mind			0
we invite you to post others			0
-- first , we should respond generously to those children who have already arrived or will soon			2
for those who qualify for refugee status under @entity28 law , we should ask families across our country to help provide new homes for them			1
-- second , we should push to establish " safe zones " -- operated by the @entity216 , supported by the @entity28 -- for returning children and their families in their native countries and work with those countries to reduce their violence and expand hope			1
opinion : border crisis could last a long time -- third , once the " safe zones " are developed , we should set a firm date when all children who arrive thereafter will be returned to their native countries regardless			1
the idea of " safe zones " is not new			1
the @entity216 has successfully established such protected areas in two major instances : to protect refugees in the @entity228 crisis of the 1970s and to shield 2 million @entity229 from slaughter by @entity232 's troops after the @entity233			1
as we learned from a " safe area " that did not work in @entity236 in 1995 , it is essential that there be enough well - armed international and regional troops on the ground to ensure zones are not overrun			1
in @entity236 , thousands lost their lives			0
understandably , many @entity28 are fatigued from trying to help other nations when our own communities are desperate for more help			1
polls show that our citizenry , frustrated and disgusted by years of wars that are ending badly , are more opposed to the @entity28 taking on new tasks overseas than at any time in the past 50 years			1
and it 's true : the only way this crisis ends well in the long run is if these @entity1 governments successfully fight back against gang violence and corruption			1
we will definitely need to aid them in their efforts , as we did in @entity260 where our financial support has helped to stem the tide			0
even so , moments inevitably come that define who we are as a people			0
as the saying goes , we may not be looking for trouble but trouble is looking for us			0
how we respond to these thousands upon thousands of desperate , destitute children is one of those moments			2
will we turn our backs , as we did so shamefully to those @entity9 refugees years ago ? or will we live by our ideals ? that is the choice we now face .			1

@entity277 , @entity278 : @entity28 turned away ship of @entity23 @entity9 refugees fleeing nazis
that shameful *episode* is remembered as fate of @entity1 children is *debated*
they say @entity216 safe zones , supported by the @entity28 , should be established in @entity1
*authors* : @entity28 has a duty to be compassionate toward the refugee children
