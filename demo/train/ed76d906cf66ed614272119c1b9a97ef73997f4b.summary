@entity0 -- as he battles with congressional @entity4 over the budget and the debt ceiling , and as a key component of his health care law kicks in , new polling suggests that president @entity10 's standing among @entity11 continues to deteriorate			1
the president 's approval rating stands at 45 % , according to a @entity1 average of four national polls conducted over the past week and a half			1
and a @entity1 @entity17 compiled and released thursday also indicates that @entity10 's disapproval rating at 49 %			2
in the afterglow of his re-election and second inauguration , the percentage of those approving of @entity10 's job performance hovered in the low 50s as the year began , according to @entity25 of @entity17 averages			2
but his numbers slipped to the upper 40s by spring and now have edged down to the mid 40s			0
at the same time , his disapproval numbers have edged up from the low 40s to right around the 50 % mark			0
anxiety and skepticism over the @entity35 , better known as @entity35 , continuing concerns over the sluggish economy , and a drop in the president 's approval on foreign policy -- once his ace in the hole -- all appear to be contributing to the slide of @entity10 's general approval rating			1
" not a precipitous drop , but more like a continued erosion in the president 's numbers , " says @entity1 chief political correspondent @entity47			1
" the @entity66 bombings , @entity57 's ' big brother ' revelations , the ' non-coup ' in @entity59 , the ' now we bomb , now we do n't ' policy in @entity63 , an economic recovery that remains disappointing , the uncertainty of how / what will change under the new health care system , shall i go on ? " " it all adds up to an awful lot of uncertainty and unfairly or not , uncertainty tends to breed lower poll numbers for the guy in charge , " added @entity47 , anchor of @entity1 's " @entity67			0
" besides being the main indicator of a president 's standing with the public , a presidential approval rating is a good gauge of his clout in dealing with @entity82			1
the drop in his numbers comes as the president pushes back against attempts by congressional republicans to use deadlines to keep the federal government funded and to extend the nation 's debt ceiling to try and defund the health care law			0
a slew of national polls conducted this month indicate that a majority does n't support shutting down the government in order to defund @entity35			0
but if the fight shifts to the debt ceiling , public opinion appears to turn against the president , who reiterated on thursday that he will not negotiate with the @entity4 in @entity82 over extending the debt ceiling			0
" as for not letting @entity11 pay its bills , i have to say , no @entity82 before this one has ever -- ever -- in history been irresponsible enough to threaten default , to threaten an economic shutdown , to suggest @entity11 not pay its bills , just to try to blackmail a president into giving them some concessions on issues that have nothing to do with a budget , " @entity10 said at a healthcare rally in @entity104			2
but two surveys released wednesday , @entity119 / @entity118 and @entity120 , indicate that a majority of the public rejects the president 's push to raise the debt ceiling with no strings attached			2
the @entity126 said wednesday that the debt ceiling , which is the amount the federal government can borrow to pay its bills , must be raised by october 17 to prevent a possible default			0
the president 's numbers may be nothing to brag about , but his polling still soars over that of @entity82			2
the approval rating @entity82 ranges from 13 % to 24 % in five national polls conducted earlier this month , with the approval for congressional democrats slightly higher than their @entity4 counterparts			1
while the president 's approval rating does n't afford him much leverage , as @entity47 points out , " it 's not anything @entity141 can take to the bargaining table			1
their approval ratings are consistently far worse than anything the president has posted			0
" the new @entity1 poll of polls averages four non-partisan , live operator , national surveys that asked the approval rating question : @entity155 daily tracking poll ( september 22 - 24 ) ; @entity120 ( september 20 - 23 ) ; @entity119 / @entity118 ( september 19 - 23 ) ; and @entity156 ( september 17 - 20 )			1
since it is an average of multiple surveys , the poll of polls does not have a sampling error .			0

new polls suggest president 's standing with @entity11 continues to erode
latest approval rating stands at 45 % , according to @entity25 of polls
anxiety and skepticism over *healtcare* law and sluggish economy appear to contribute to decline
