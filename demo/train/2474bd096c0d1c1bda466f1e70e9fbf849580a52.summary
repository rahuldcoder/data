@entity0 -- at 106 - feet tall , the new control tower at @entity3 in @entity4 could be called monumental			2
on friday the nation will learn whether it 's a monument to government dysfunction			0
opened last may with a $ 5.3 million from one federal government program , the tower could be closed because of another			2
the stimulus package -- a 2009 law spearheaded by president @entity13 to jump - start the economy -- was @entity15 , giving @entity3 the new tower			0
the forced spending cuts -- which went into effect march 1 -- are the @entity19 threatening to shut the tower down			1
" it 's so much irony , it 's almost ridiculous and laughable , " said @entity21 , one of the controllers expected to lose her job			0
" i mean , we 're all so disgusted with it			0
" @entity27 says 173 air traffic control towers will close april 7 altogether , 238 towers are on the chopping block			1
on friday , the @entity27 is focusing on 189 low - or moderate - volume towers staffed by contractors			1
in letters to the airports , the @entity27 said it expects to cut funding to the " vast majority " of the towers			1
but the sharpest sting may be felt at those towers that have just opened , often at great government expense and at personal sacrifice to people who moved to accept the controller posts			0
at least three towers , like @entity3 , were built with federal stimulus money and still have that " new car " smell			1
at @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , a tower built to withstand 130 mph hurricane winds was dedicated in july			0
it was built with $ 1 million in stimulus money and $ 2.1 million in congressional earmarks			0
at @entity57 , near @entity58 , the federal government spent almost $ 1.9 million in federal stimulus money on the new control tower			0
both are likely to be axed			0
" it makes no sense , " said @entity62 , president of the @entity63 , a national group headquartered at the @entity3 airport			0
" @entity68 something is going to happen , and then were going to review this decision and , i 'm sure , roll back some of the cuts they are considering now , " @entity62 said			0
survey : @entity74 entry driving visitors away the @entity27 says it is facing an untenable situation			2
by congressional mandate , it must cut nearly $ 600 million from its nearly $ 48 billion budget this fiscal year			0
because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers , it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers , the agency says			1
the @entity27 is furloughing employees , eliminating midnight shifts at some control towers and reducing maintenance on non-critical facilities			1
in an effort to affect the fewest travelers , the @entity27 said it is targeting lower - volume airports -- those that have fewer than 150,000 operations a year ( a takes off or landing is an operation ) and fewer than 10,000 commercial operations			1
the 238 towers fall under those thresholds , including 49 @entity27 - staffed towers and 189 contractor - staffed towers			1
the @entity27 cuts to be announced friday focus solely on the contract towers			1
the @entity27 said it will consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the " national interest " to do so			2
the @entity27 received 1,000 letters from the airports appealing the action			1
it has declined requests to make those letters public			0
but in letters released by the airports , many have cited their use by the military and medical flights , and their roles as " reliever airports " for nearby airports as evidence of their national significance			2
closing towers will not meaning closing airports			2
@entity63 can use services from other @entity27 facilities or can use a common radio frequency to announce their intentions to take off or land			1
the @entity27 says the closures will not impact safety			2
airports can make case to keep towers open if the @entity27 said building the tower would improve safety , controller @entity139 says , how can it argue that closing the tower wo n't hurt safety ? controllers say closing the towers will eliminate one layer of safety -- the extra set of eyes in the tower -- while contributing to the workload at other @entity27 towers , which will themselves be affected by furloughs			1
the @entity27 said it will manage the system by reducing volume , not reducing safety			2
as a result , flights to major cities such as @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours when the effects of furloughs are felt later this spring			0
" delays in those major airports will ripple across the country , " the @entity27 says			1
the most immediate impact will be on non-commercial flights			0
the 189 contract towers handle approximately 20 % of all airport operations nationwide , but less than 2.5 % of commercial operations , the @entity27 says			1
advocates for contract towers argue they are suffering a disproportionate amount of pain			0
" the rest of the @entity27 's budget is getting a 5 % haircut ; the contract towers are getting a 75 % cut , because the @entity27 is cutting 189 of the 251 contract towers , " @entity178 of the @entity74 @entity179 told @entity1			1
@entity1 correspondent @entity186 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity27 will announce which of 189 air traffic control towers will be closed
the towers , some recently built , will be closed *due* to forced spending cuts
@entity195 will close the " vast majority " of towers , letters to airports say
