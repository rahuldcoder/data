@entity0 -- the new @entity3 push for immigration reform is drawing praise -- but some skepticism -- south of the border			1
@entity0 's foreign ministry said tuesday that it " welcomes the principles that have been set out " in @entity3 president @entity11 's remarks calling for immigration reform , and the proposal presented monday by a bipartisan group of @entity3 senators			1
a @entity16 lawmaker told @entity1 en @entity17 that @entity3 politicians were proposing a plan that would help millions of undocumented immigrants in the @entity3 -- nearly 60 % of whom are @entity16 , according to government estimates			2
" it 's a real reform " and a significant step , said sen. @entity23 of the ruling @entity24			1
the @entity16 government has n't weighed in on specific details in this week 's proposal from eight @entity3 senators , a plan that would give undocumented immigrants immediate but provisional legal status to live and work in @entity3 , and eventually allow them to apply for green cards			2
but there are an estimated 6.8 million undocumented immigrants from @entity0 living in the @entity3 who could benefit from such an overhaul of the @entity3 immigration system			1
and that 's a statistic that is n't lost on @entity16 officials , who have been pushing for changes in @entity3 immigration policies for years			1
in legal briefs and public speeches , they 've argued against racial profiling they said would be fostered by @entity3 state immigration laws and called for changes in federal laws to bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows			2
' at last , the @entity3 government is taking notice ' the fresh possibility of immigration reform in the @entity3 has made headlines in @entity0 's leading newspapers this week			1
in the central @entity16 city of @entity60 , where many residents have family members living in the @entity3 , proposals to change @entity3 immigration policies were hailed as a positive step			1
" it 's good news , " said @entity64 , who watched a @entity66 translation on @entity16 television of @entity11 's tuesday speech			2
" at last , the @entity3 government is taking notice of this problem that is important for their country and ours			0
" @entity76 , who came back to @entity77 to run a pizza restaurant after working as an immigrant in the @entity3 , said he was happy to hear that change could be coming			0
" i 'm glad immigrants may be able to fix their documents , " he said , " because many die on the border or suffer a lot			0
" in @entity0 's capital , the new push for immigration reform in the @entity3 was met with some skepticism			1
" it is possibly a waste of time			0
i do n't see it succeeding , " said @entity93 , an accountant			0
" there is no compassion , and we need to work much more diplomatically			0
" @entity98 , director of the @entity0 - based immigrant rights organization @entity100 ( without @entity101 ) , cautioned against high expectations for reform based on recent comments from @entity3 politicians			1
" these are the first steps , " she said , adding that what the government does will speak volumes			0
" we find contradictions in the willingness expressed publicly and the concrete actions of the government , " she said , noting that deportations from the @entity3 have increased in recent years			0
@entity0 's foreign ministry noted tuesday that the push for immigration policy changes seemed to be gaining momentum			1
" the priority of protecting the rights of individuals , regardless of their migratory status , has been rightly included at the center of this debate , " the foreign ministry said in a written statement			1
while the issue is an internal @entity3 political matter , the foreign ministry said , it concerns millions who live in @entity0 and in other countries			1
" because of this , the @entity16 government will continue respectfully promoting an informed debate of the many dimensions of this topic , and protecting the rights of its citizens abroad , " the foreign ministry said			1
advocating for migrants , pushing for change the @entity16 government has n't shied away from pushing for changes in @entity3 immigration laws in the past			1
in recent years , @entity0 has filed friend - of - the - court briefs in lawsuits challenging state measures aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration in @entity148 and @entity149 , arguing that the measures would lead to profiling and violate the human rights of @entity16 nationals			2
and @entity0 's foreign ministry has sharply condemned what it has called " disproportionate use of lethal force in the exercising of immigration control functions " by @entity159 agents			1
shortly after he was named as @entity0 's new ambassador to the @entity3 earlier this month , @entity160 said the issue of immigration reform was of " great interest " to the @entity16 government , while noting that it was a complicated political issue in the @entity3			1
" this is an issue on the internal political agenda of the @entity3			0
it is not an issue on the bilateral agenda			0
nonetheless we have a very great interest , an unavoidable responsibility to defend the interests of our fellow citizens and to promote an argument that increases opportunities for them , " @entity160 told reporters			0
for more than a decade , the @entity16 government has played an active role advocating for millions of migrants abroad			2
shortly after taking office in 2000 , then - president @entity181 met with migrants in his official residence and soon created a cabinet - level position dedicated to @entity16 who were living in other countries			2
during his administration , @entity16 won the right to vote abroad in 2005 after a hard - fought legislative campaign			0
and @entity16 government officials have created matching programs aimed at using the money @entity16 sent home to fund public works projects south of the @entity3 - @entity0 border			2
it 's a significant shift in a country where emigrants were once treated as traitors abandoning their homeland			0
now , it 's common for @entity16 officials to acknowledge emigrants ' contributions , and to advocate on their behalf			0
in a visit to the @entity209 last year , @entity16 president @entity207 said he supported @entity11 's push for immigration reform			1
" more than demanding what you should do , i do want to tell you that we want to contribute , " he said			0
" we really want to participate and we want to contribute toward the accomplishment , so we can participate in the betterment and well - being of so many people who live in your country			0
