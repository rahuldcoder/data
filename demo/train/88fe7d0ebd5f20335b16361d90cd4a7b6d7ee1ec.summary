-- in the popular @entity4 thrillers from which " @entity5 " has been fashioned , the title character 's physical dimensions are integral to his mysterious - loner - silent - drifter - violent - hero stature : he 's 6 ' 5 '' , brawny , and blond			1
so @entity12 , who is not , has his work cut out for him in his mission to impress both those who already have strong notions about how @entity5 ought to look and those just now meeting the freelance one - man justice league and trying to take his measure			1
that @entity12 fails to make a case for @entity5 's allure , though , has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the film 's inability — stupefying inability , really — to otherwise make a case for the character 's originality in a movie so choked with visual clichés and dreadfully moldy dialogue			1
written and directed by @entity34 ( who previously worked with @entity12 on " @entity35 " ) , " @entity5 " stumbles around looking for a unifying narrative tone , while the star soldiers on , offering up his generic action - hero stance of calm , opaque concentration			1
( an obligatory shirtless shot of @entity12 confirms that his famous discipline in all things physical and mental still pays off			2
) @entity0 : best and worst nudity of 2012 the story , meanwhile , is run - of - the - mill muscular pulp			0
while all evidence points to a former military sniper in the apparently random shooting of five victims , @entity5 follows his own instincts — calmly , opaquely , except when he 's a coldly violent fighting machine — and draws his own conclusions			2
along the way , he crosses paths with a @entity58 mobster sinister enough to sound exactly like @entity59 , maybe because @entity59 plays said mobster with lip - smacking gusto and a display of tiny teeth			0
and @entity5 works side by side with a @entity66 — probably as good a name for her as any , since @entity71 beauty @entity69 ( " @entity72 " ) is given a @entity73 of a role to work with			0
" @entity5 " does n't play well with others ; @entity5 is an argument to leave the guy alone			0
