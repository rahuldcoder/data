this is a story affecting millions of @entity1 — and it does not involve suicide bombings , honor killings , extremism or president @entity7 's mustache			1
" what would you like to be when you grow up ? " i asked @entity11 , a boisterous 12 - year - old girl , while visiting a remote @entity1 village in the @entity14 province			1
" a scientist ! " she immediately replied			0
" why ca n't we be scientists ? why not us ? " the confident @entity11 lives in @entity19 village , which is home to 500 people in @entity21			1
it is in one of the most impoverished regions of @entity1			2
there was a characteristic resilience and optimism in this particular village			0
this should come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about @entity1 's often dysfunctional , surreal yet endearing daily existence			1
the 500 villagers live in 48 small huts , except for the one " wealthy " family who recently built a home made of concrete			0
the village chief , @entity19 , proudly showed off his village 's brand - new community toilets , paved roads , and water pump that brings fresh water to the village			1
these simple , critical amenities , taken for granted by most of us in the @entity48 , resulted from the direct assistance of the @entity50 , @entity1 's largest nongovernmental organization			1
@entity50 has worked with thousands of similar @entity1 villages to help them achieve economic self - sufficiency			2
i visited the @entity14 village with @entity50 to witness the results of using community organizing to alleviate poverty			1
the staff told me its goal was to teach villagers to " fish for themselves			0
" every household in the @entity19 village was able to reach a profit by the end of 2011 as a result of professional skills training , financial management , community leadership workshops and microloans			1
specifically , a middle - aged , illiterate woman proudly told me how she learned sewing and financial management and was thus able to increase her household revenue , manage her bills , and use a small profit to purchase an extra cow for the family			1
she was excited to introduce me to her cow , but sadly due to lack of time i was unable to make the bovine acquaintance			0
women play a prominent role in this village 's process toward empowerment and self - sustenance			1
here , in one of the most traditional and rural regions of @entity1 , almost all of the presentations were led by women			2
all of their daughters from the ages of 6 to 12 are now 100 % literate			0
in comparison , only 31 % of the entire village and 12 % of females 15 and older can read			0
all this is particularly pertinent to @entity1 's wider sociopolitical context			2
in a country where change is so often top - down and directed by national elites mostly interested in maintaining the status quo for sake of sustaining their vice-like grip on power and wealth , grassroots empowerment can potentially change deeply ingrained feudal and tribal traditions			0
this power — to progressively change societal patterns and norms from the bottom up — is a rarity in @entity1 and a crucial counterweight to more extreme narratives currently sweeping the nation			1
the village 's local community manager — a woman — reflected some of this positive sentiment when she passed on a hopeful message to @entity127 : " we take pride in our traditional work and livelihood , and we hope you too can enjoy them			1
we hope to trade with you in the future and to have better relations			0
and we hope and believe we can be a developed nation like you			0
" asked what single thing she felt was most important most for her village , she replied education			0
upon asking another elderly lady what she wishes for @entity1 , she repeated one word three times : " sukoon , " which means peace			2
when it was time to depart , the people of the village presented me with a beautiful handmade @entity155 shawl , an example of the craftwork the villagers are now able to sell for profit			2
as i left the village with the dark red , traditional sindhi shawl adorned around my neck , my thoughts returned to the 12 - year - old girl , @entity11 , who passionately asked why she could n't become a scientist			2
i looked in her eyes and could only respond with the following : " you 're right			0
you can be anything you want to be			0
and i have every confidence you will , inshallah ( " @entity173 willing " ) , reach your manzil ( " desired destination " )			0
by focusing on education and local empowerment to lift the next generation out of poverty , @entity11 's dream could indeed one day become a reality for all of @entity1 .			1

*journalist* @entity181 recently visited a @entity1 village that is pulling itself out of poverty
a group has helped teach the people professional skills and financial management
women are playing a prominent role , too , in a place they once did n't
@entity181 says the village 's story runs counter to more extreme narratives in the country
