-- president @entity1 built his push for a sweeping overhaul of the health care system on the premise that reform is essential for economic recovery			1
president @entity1 has said overhauling health care is a key part of economic recovery			1
but with some economists saying the recession shows signs of ending , will that weaken @entity1 's argument ? " if the economy is picking up , then more people are going to get jobs and more people are going to have health insurance , and so they are going to be less concerned with health care reform because they will figure , ' i 'm taken care of , ' " said @entity16 , director of health policy studies at the @entity18 , a libertarian think tank			1
but @entity26 , a @entity27 strategist , said a recovering economy will help @entity1 's push for health care legislation because " it will be a huge shot in the arm for @entity1 's political capital			1
" " it lessens people 's anxieties that are being stirred up by the opponents of health care reform			1
it gives credibility to the argument that government has an appropriate role to play in solving the nation 's problems , " @entity38 said			0
@entity1 ran on a campaign to fix the health care system , and since taking office , the president repeatedly has tried to show how this overhaul fits into his broader economic strategy			1
in a speech in june before the @entity53 , @entity1 warned that inaction could have dire consequences			2
" make no mistake : the cost of our health care is a threat to our economy			1
it is an escalating burden on our families and businesses			0
it is a ticking time bomb for the federal budget			0
and it is unsustainable for the @entity69 , " he said			0
while the president has said health care is his top domestic priority this year , the public seems to disagree			1
eighty - three percent of people are satisfied with their current health care , and 74 percent are satisfied with their health insurance , according to a @entity78 poll released last week			2
" health care reform has not been the top priority for voters			2
no. 2 is the deficit and government spending			0
health care is third , " said @entity87 , @entity0 's senior political analyst			2
but @entity89 , an associate professor of political science and director of @entity69 studies at @entity93 , said the public is n't as concerned about the economics - driven case to overhaul health care			1
" i personally think that the vast majority of the public does n't get that connection between the economy and health care			1
i think they 're seeing it more as a personal issue -- something that could affect them , their families , their friends , " she said , noting that because people have an emotional involvement in the debate , the public is not likely to let it drop			0
that personal anxiety has manifested itself at town hall meetings across the country , where , angry protesters and other citizens have showed up to voice their doubts to their lawmakers			0
voters have asked their lawmakers what reform means for them -- and how they can be assured that @entity1 's proposals are good ideas			2
the august congressional recess , however , could end up being a blessing in disguise for @entity27 , @entity38 said			0
" it may persuade enough of them that they do need to be more moderate and incremental in the approach , and they may actually come up with a package that is even more popular than what would have otherwise been , had they tried to get the bill through before august , " he said			0
if the economy recovers , plenty of @entity140 and even a few @entity27 will remind voters that @entity1 was wrong about the importance of reform to economic recovery , @entity87 said			1
" what will @entity1 say ? that the recovery can not be sustained over the long term without health care reform			1
" @entity1 sent a similar message in his radio address last weekend , citing the slightly better than expected job numbers as " a sign that we 've begun to put the brakes on this recession and that the worst may be behind us			0
" " but we must do more than rescue our economy from this immediate crisis ; we must rebuild it stronger than before			0
we must lay a new foundation for future growth and prosperity , and a key pillar of a new foundation is health insurance reform -- reform that we are now closer to achieving than ever before , " he said			0
but even if the effort does take on a lower profile , it could still have real consequences for @entity27 , as it did 15 years ago , @entity87 said			0
president @entity172 's push to overhaul health care failed , and the issue faded from the agenda as the economy recovered , but the ramifications were felt in the next election cycle			1
" @entity172 had to scale back his agenda			2
his big ideas for health care reform turned into protecting ' the safety net			2
' and , of course , the @entity27 lost control of @entity185 in 1994 for the first time in 40 years , and it took them another 12 years to get it back , " @entity87 said .			0
