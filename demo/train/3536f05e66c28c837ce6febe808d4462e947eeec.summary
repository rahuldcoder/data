picking through the rubble of war - damaged buildings in combat zones , looking for enemies , survivors , booby traps or worse is one of the most dangerous jobs in the military			2
to take the dirt and danger out of mopping up operations , a @entity12 agency is developing a surveillance robo - hawk that could fly through the detritus of the urban combat jungle at 45mph			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) -- already famous as the maker of some of the @entity24 military 's more far - fetched war robots -- aims to develop autonomous drones small enough to fit through an open window			2
speeding through unstable buildings or threatening indoor spaces at 20 meters per second , the unmanned aerial vehicle would obviate the need for physical entry that puts troops or civilian response teams at risk			2
part of a military brief called the @entity39 program , the study is looking at developing new algorithms to allow a small @entity41 operating without a remote pilot and without use of gps waypoints to navigate stairways , corridors and other obstacles			1
" @entity50 and flying insects exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small @entity41 , " said @entity48 , @entity19 's @entity49			1
" @entity56 , for example , can fly very fast through a dense forest without smacking into a tree			2
" many insects , too , can dart and hover with incredible speed and precision			0
" the goal of the @entity39 program is to explore non-traditional perception and autonomy methods that would give small @entity41 the capacity to perform in a similar way , including an ability to easily navigate tight spaces at high speed and quickly recognize if it had already been in a room before			1
" ultimately , the agency says the algorithms developed in the program could enhance other types of unmanned missions , including underwater environments where gps systems do n't work			1
" urban and disaster relief operations would be obvious key beneficiaries , but applications for this technology could extend to a wide variety of missions using small and large unmanned systems linked together with manned platforms as a system of systems , " said @entity80 , director of @entity19 's @entity81			1
the aim of the program would be to take the grunt work out of repetitive tasks where fatigue can mean the difference between life and death			2
" by enabling unmanned systems to learn ' muscle memory ' and perception for basic tasks like avoiding obstacles , it would relieve overload and stress on human operators so they can focus on supervising the systems and executing the larger mission			2
" miniaturizing drones that could negotiate indoor environments has also been a focus of the @entity24 military			0
its @entity115 , known as @entity115 , in @entity116 , @entity117 , are currently working on a project to develop robotic surveillance insects with wings just 3 - 5 centimeters in length			1
the wings are made of lead zirconium titanate , known as @entity123 , a material that flaps and bends when a small voltage is applied			0
" we demonstrated that we can actually create lift , " said dr @entity126 who heads the team			0
" so we know this structure has the potential to fly			0
" powered by tiny ultrasonic motors that measure just 2 to 3 millimeters , the team has also designed a millipede - like robot that simulates crawling when voltage is applied to the @entity123 material			0
while the team has shown that the project works in principle , @entity126 said that it may take a further 10 - 15 years of research before the @entity115 has a fully functional robotic surveillance insect			1
he said that more research would be needed to establish algorithms that would allow a robotic insect to stabilize itself			1
more collaboration with other institutions -- @entity147 , for instance , has a " robo - fly " project three - times larger than the @entity115 's robotic insect -- would be necessary to make a fully working prototype			1
@entity126 said the smaller the mechanical device , the more intricate are its aerodynamic problems			0
in a gust of wind a fly " does n't instantaneously stabilize itself , " @entity126 said			0
" it will tumble , tumble , and then stabilize itself			0
" creating this type of artificial intelligence or " cognitive ability " would take time , he said , and a number of different systems must be integrated to develop a robot that functions like an insect			0
