a @entity1 lawmaker demanded wednesday to know why investigators have not captured or killed any of the suspects in the attack on the @entity6 diplomatic mission in @entity7 , pointing out that @entity8 was able to find a man who some say was the ringleader in the assault that left the ambassador and three other @entity6 dead			1
eight @entity1 lawmakers are asking that incoming fbi director @entity16 brief @entity15 within 30 days about the investigation			0
they say the administration 's inquiry into the september 11 , 2012 , attacks in @entity21 has been " simply unacceptable , " according to a draft letter obtained by @entity8			1
" one of the pertinent questions today is why we have not captured or killed the terrorist who committed these attacks ? " rep. @entity27 , @entity28 , told reporters			1
" news out today that @entity8 was able to go in and talk to one of the suspected terrorists , how come the military has n't been able to get after them and capture or kill the people ? how come the @entity35 is n't doing this and yet @entity8 is ? " @entity27 was referring to @entity8 's recent interview with @entity38 , who @entity21 and @entity6 officials have described as the @entity7 leader of the @entity42 - affiliated militia group @entity41 -- one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of @entity48			1
he has been described as a " person of interest " in the investigation , according to officials			0
in that interview , @entity38 told @entity8 's @entity52 that he had not been contacted by any @entity21 or @entity6 officials			1
@entity55 panel subpoenas @entity56 over @entity7 " even the investigative team did not try to contact me , " he told @entity58 , referring to the @entity35			2
when asked whether he would be willing to meet with investigators if they asked , @entity38 said : " yes , no problem			1
... but not as an interrogation , as a conversation like the one we are having right now			0
" @entity58 spent two hours interviewing @entity38 at a coffee shop at a well - known hotel in @entity7 , describing his demeanor as fairly relaxed			2
he allowed @entity58 to use an audio recorder to tape the conversation , but refused to appear on camera			0
@entity38 's narrative of the events that night was sometimes unclear and , at times , seemed to be contradictory , @entity58 said			2
he admitted to being at the compound the night of the attack , but denied any involvement in the violence			0
when he arrived at the perimeter of the compound , @entity38 said he saw men carrying rpgs and medium guns , but that gunfire prevented him from getting close and entering the compound			2
opinion : @entity7 blame game is useless @entity38 said by the time he managed to get inside the compound , everyone had withdrawn			2
he said he did not see any fires			0
asked about allegations he may have masterminded the attack , @entity38 and two of the men he brought with him to the interview " burst out laughing , " @entity58 said			1
@entity38 does not appear to be a man who is in hiding , having granted interviews to the @entity97 , @entity98 and other news agencies in the weeks following the @entity7 attack			1
" rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved in the attack , " the lawmakers wrote in their letter to @entity16 , who will replace @entity103 as @entity35 director in september			1
" the @entity35 continues to add pictures of potential assailants to its website and asks the @entity21 people to assist with identifying the alleged perpetrators			1
we struggle to understand why we do n't know more about those who attacked two @entity6 compounds and murdered four brave @entity6			2
" the @entity35 did not immediately respond to a @entity8 request for comment on the letter			1
the letter was initiated by @entity27 and sen. @entity120 of @entity121 , two of the fiercest critics of the administration 's @entity7 response			0
others who agreed to sign the letter included sens. @entity127 of @entity128 , @entity129 of @entity130 and @entity131 of @entity132			0
on the @entity55 side , @entity136 , the chairman of the committee leading the @entity7 investigation , @entity133 of @entity121 and @entity134 of @entity135 signed the letter			0
in the letter , the lawmakers wrote : " we encourage you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable those who attacked our compounds in @entity7			0
we owe the families of those killed , and the people of this nation , answers to who was responsible and ensure they are held accountable			0
" the attack at the @entity7 diplomatic compound has become a political flashpoint in a long - running battle between the administration and @entity1 , who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack , of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the november election			0
@entity55 releases @entity7 e-mails the @entity1 suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation advanced by @entity167 ambassador @entity166 in television appearances -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an @entity173 film that was produced in the @entity6			1
the @entity55 and its allies in @entity15 have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the " fog of war , " not any deliberate effort to mislead the public .			0

rep. @entity27 wants to know why the @entity35 has n't interviewed @entity38
some have described @entity38 as the ringleader of the attack on the *consulate*
@entity38 tells @entity8 that no @entity6 or @entity21 official has asked to speak to him
he denies he had any role in the attack the left ambassador , three other @entity6 dead
