people are looking for that place inside of them where they are of some use			0
" @entity79 , who lives in @entity102 , @entity90 , dismissed @entity75 's suggestion at first but came back to it when she realized she had nothing to lose by trying			0
what followed made her a convert to the idea			1
whether she simply called a friend to offer support or bought iced - tea for a homeless guy on a hot day , the simple actions made a difference			1
