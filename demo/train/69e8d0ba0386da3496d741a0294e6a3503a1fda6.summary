@entity0 , @entity1 -- there were no major announcements and no breathtaking new gadgets , but this year 's @entity5 did offer up more than its fair share of unexpected uses for digital technology			1
here are a few of the stranger sights that were creating a buzz around this year 's event in @entity0			2
@entity14 - enabled walking stick clearly aimed at the elderly , or anyone with walking difficulties , this prototype from @entity18 's @entity17 is a stick fitted with gps navigation features , health monitoring sensors and @entity24 and wireless connectivity			1
the stick , known as @entity27 , allows relatives , carers or perhaps medics to track the user 's real time movements while also recording heart rate			0
the stick also has the potential to summon emergency services			0
while the stick is some way off launch , @entity17 has clearly been putting a great deal of thought about how its technology can benefit senior citizens -- a shrewd move given @entity18 's aging population			2
it has also created a phone specifically aimed at the elderly , featuring a large keypad and sound enhancement			0
@entity50 @entity51 from @entity52 drew our attention to this quirky two - faced device			1
here 's what he had to say : a smartphone running @entity60 's @entity59 operating system and a 4.3 - inch touchscreen on the front ? you might be thinking there 's no shortage of those around , and you 'd be right , but the @entity50 offers something none of the others can : a second screen , on the back of the phone			1
tell us : what 's your dream smartphone feature ? this screen uses the monochrome e-ink technology seen in @entity77 's kindle and other e-readers , and uses very little battery power			1
the screen can be customized to show whatever image you please , but more interesting are the apps that allow it to display @entity83 , @entity84 and rss feeds , or a clock or weather report			2
sensirion micro temperature sensor this tiny speck of technology will give mobiles the ability to measure temperature and humidity , opening the door to a whole new realm of applications			1
@entity98 says its device will give your mobile the ability to " feel , " offering all kinds of biofeedback possibilities			2
at the very least it should enable it to accurately read the weather conditions around you			0
it could also prove an invaluable healthcare or sports monitoring tool			0
next , presumably , we will get phones that can smell and taste			0
glove - friendly touch screens forget its claims to being the world 's fastest phone			2
ignore the brilliant touch screen and the powerful 13 megapixel camera			1
disregard its slender 8.4mm side profile			0
what sets @entity124 manufacturer @entity123 's flagship @entity126 smartphone apart is the fact that it can be operated by users wearing gloves			0
read more : gadget show goes soft on hardware @entity134 - ready mobiles are n't new -- @entity136 's @entity135 also responds to fingers cloaked in fabric -- but for anyone who regularly checks their phone in freezing conditions , any fresh addition is a great leap forward			1
robotic balls a popular attraction in one corner of @entity5 were robotic @entity149 balls that can be controlled using a @entity24 - equipped smartphone			1
@entity149 's manufacturer , @entity152 - based @entity151 , was in @entity0 to launch a new range of augmented reality games , including one in which the robotic ball becomes , in @entity158 's own words , " a cupcake - munching beaver			1
" running , jumping and standing still @entity163 's @entity162 , having nothing new to promote beyond last year 's showstopping one x , instead decided to offer up a troupe of @entity166 athletes who wowed congress - goers with their acrobatics			0
why ? we have no idea			0
@entity171 contributed to this story from @entity173 , @entity174 .			0

@entity14 - enabled walking stick among the usual uses for mobile technology on display at @entity5 in @entity0
other gadgets included the @entity50 , a device featuring both a color touch screen and a screen using low - power monochome e-ink
@entity134 - ready mobiles , robotic balls and temperature - sensing *microchips* were also on display
