" tensions over territorial disputes have spiked this year between @entity58 and a string of countries around its coastline -- from @entity95 in the south to @entity78 in the northeast -- and the @entity3 has been drawn into the fray			1
but @entity59 , which prefers to tackle the disputes bilaterally , has reacted angrily to @entity101 's involvement in the matter , accusing the @entity51 of " unfounded accusations " and showing a " total disregard of facts			0
" at the joint news conference with @entity9 on wednesday , @entity79 took a more diplomatic tack , saying that " freedom of navigation and safety in the @entity83 is assured			2

but that was enough to prompt a stern response from @entity135 , a @entity136 spokesman			0
" i want to emphasize again that any unilateral actions taken by the @entity78 regarding the @entity117 are illegal and invalid , " he said			0
