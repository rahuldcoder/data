@entity0 , @entity1 -- known as much for his gaffes , brusque manner and eccentricities as for his charity and campaigning work , prince @entity3 seems to have lived a life permanently in the shadow of his wife , @entity11 yet as a child born into the turmoil of inter-war @entity15 , a naval officer decorated for heroism in @entity18 , and one half of one of the most - enduring modern royal marriages , the @entity3 is an extraordinary figure in his own right			1
and while @entity25 celebrated 60 years since the queen succeeded as monarch earlier this year , the spotlight also shone on the man who has rarely left her side during her time in the spotlight			0
prince @entity3 's life was dramatic from the outset			1
the nephew of @entity35 's @entity34 , he was born in 1921 on the dining room table of a villa on the @entity35 island of @entity39			0
known then simply as @entity3 -- he had no official surname -- he was forced into exile just 18 months later when the @entity35 monarchy was overthrown by a military revolt			1
sailors on board @entity45 , the @entity25 cruiser given the secret mission to carry his family to safety , made him a crib out of an old fruit box			2
stateless and ( by royal standards ) poor , @entity3 's family spent the next few years wandering between the homes of @entity15 relatives as the continent descended into the political and economic upheaval that would lead to @entity18 after his mother @entity61 was committed to a psychiatric clinic in 1930 , @entity3 rarely saw his parents			1
he was instead mentored by an uncle , @entity64 , and dispatched to a series of boarding schools in @entity1 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
in 1936 , @entity35 voted to reinstate its monarchy , but @entity3 's father @entity70 resisted pressure to push his son into @entity35 military service			1
instead , @entity3 remained at @entity74 , the school in @entity68 where he would later send his own sons , and began to prepare for training in @entity25 's @entity78			1
by the time he reached his late teens , @entity3 's dashing looks were turning heads , including the 13 - year - old distant cousin ( they are both great , great grandchildren of @entity84 ) who would later become his bride			1
but naval duty came first , and with the outbreak of war , @entity3 was sent to sea			1
as a citizen of @entity35 , @entity3 was initially deployed as a " neutral foreigner " serving on naval escort and convoy missions			1
but after @entity94 invaded @entity35 in 1940 he was assigned to @entity95 , a battleship that would soon see action in the @entity98			2
@entity3 was commended for his operation of searchlights during a 1941 night battle near @entity102 , where the @entity25 destroyed much of the @entity94 fleet			1
he was later awarded the @entity104 of @entity105			0
after various postings and promotions , @entity3 was in 1944 appointed first lieutenant of @entity109 , a destroyer that went on to see action in the @entity111 as part of a @entity25 fleet involved with joint operations with the @entity115 , including the landings at @entity117			1
when peace came , @entity3 remained in the navy , but rekindled a friendship with @entity121 that quickly blossomed into a public romance			2
the pair were married in @entity124 in 1947 and shortly afterwards he returned to duty , rising to the rank of lieutenant commander			0
see also : the royal family tree newly - appointed as @entity130 , @entity3 had to abandon his naval career for royal duties after the queen 's father , @entity129 became ill. the king died while @entity3 and @entity121 were on an official trip to @entity137			1
it was @entity3 who broke the news to his wife -- now the queen			2
the early years of the the couple 's marriage saw the prince enjoy the height of his popularity			2
on a 1951 trip to @entity151 , crowds of admiring women turned out to see the handsome prince			2
in 1957 , @entity153 said he had transformed his " frosty bride " into a " stylish " royal icon			0
while affection for the duke remains strong today -- as was shown by an outpouring of concern when he underwent heart surgery last year -- his public image as a dashing young man has long since been replaced by one of an irascible older figure			2
many have drawn links between the duke 's manner and his experiences as a young man , suggesting his troubled family life helped shape a rather detached and unemotional outlook , while his navy career endowed him with a salty wit that frequently raises eyebrows			1
others attest to his charisma and charm , characteristics that no doubt helped fuel rumors of indiscretions in the early years of his marriage			2
in 1956 , the year before @entity3 was officially appointed as a prince , the queen 's household had to officially deny such rumors			1
the duke himself has spoken of his own struggles to find a purpose within the royal family , saying he took on patronages -- including the @entity192 he created to recognize community service -- out of duty rather than passion			0
" i did n't want to be president of the @entity198 , " he said in an interview in 1992			0
" i was asked to do it			0
i 'd much rather have stayed in the navy , frankly			0
" yet he has found time to pursue his own , sometimes odd , interests			0
over the years these have included polo , competitive horse carriage driving ( a sport in which he has represented @entity25 ) science , the study of @entity209 , practical jokes , painting and taking the wheel of his own @entity0 taxi			0
but despite several recent high profile appearances , the duke has taken a step back from public life in the past year			0
" i reckon i 've done my bit , " he said in a 2011 interview			0
" i want to enjoy myself a bit now , with less responsibility , less frantic rushing about , less preparation , less trying to think of something to say			0
