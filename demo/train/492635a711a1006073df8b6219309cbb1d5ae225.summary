@entity0 -- in the days immediately following the presidential election , @entity2 was in a blue funk			2
a latino @entity5 , he watched with dismay as poll after poll revealed that not only did president @entity9 win a second term in office , but he did so with a sizable portion of the @entity14 vote			1
the loss was especially painful for @entity2 , who spent hours knocking on the doors of @entity17 around @entity18 in an effort to convince them to give the @entity5 a try			1
" out in the field in @entity18 , the comments i got ... the feedback was @entity25 's for the millionaires			2
we 're these poor hispanics , so we 're going to vote for @entity9 because he 's for the little guy , " @entity2 said , his voice full of exasperation			2
" there is this class warfare game that @entity33 play every single election cycle			0
we have to start now , reaching out now and not sit on the sidelines until the next cycle , " he said			0
the growing influence of @entity38 , blacks , women and young people in @entity42 is not a new story			1
demographers have known that at some point the country would become more non-white than white			0
social scientists knew that the @entity50 landscape was changing , and that change would begin to have profound impact on the nation 's shifting identity			1
seven ways religious diversity played in the election earlier this year , even @entity25 , in the secretly - recorded video where he attacked the so - called " 47 % , " understood what was going on			0
" so we can capture women 's votes , we 're having a much harder time with @entity14 voters , " he told a gathering of conservative donors			1
" and if the @entity14 voting bloc becomes as committed to the @entity33 as the @entity50 voting bloc has in the past , why , we 're in trouble as a party and , i think , as a nation			1
" for generations , those who knew politics predicted this change would happen one day			2
on tuesday , it did			0
for several election cycles now , women have represented more than half of the electorate yet have been an under - appreciated voting bloc			2
add to that the explosive growth of and increased political activism among @entity38 , many of whom are younger , under 35			2
then there is the generations - long fight for political gains among @entity50 , helping culminate in the re-election of the nation 's first black president			1
the growing political power among other minority groups and vocal youth vote has meant that the party these groups largely back -- @entity33 -- netted huge gains during this election cycle			1
@entity101 : what the election teaches us about ourselves the new @entity50 electorate , it seems , has arrived			1
and it may be spelling big trouble for @entity5			1
" the minority groups that carried president @entity9 to victory are on track to become a majority of the nation 's population by 2050 , " researchers @entity109 and @entity111 wrote in an analysis piece for the @entity113			0
@entity109 added that those groups account for 37 % of the population , and cast " a record 28 % of the votes in the 2012 presidential election			0
" for the first time in the nation 's history , women and minorities will hold the majority of the @entity33 's @entity133 seats , according to an analysis by @entity135			1
however , the @entity5 side of the aisle will remain largely white and male			1
opinion : @entity5 voter suppression fueled black turnout more women voted for @entity9 than @entity25 while it is too early to tell what type of long - term impact these newly powerful @entity50 will have on the nature of politics , exit polling suggests their impact was felt in both top of the ticket , down - ballot races and state initiatives across the country			1
according to @entity1 's exit polls , 55 % of women and 45 % of men voted for @entity9 , while 44 % of women and 52 % of men voted for @entity25			2
that level of female support for the president made an especially big impact in swing states like @entity164 where the gender breakdown mirrored the national figures			0
@entity9 garnered 44 % of the @entity14 vote , numbers which likely helped him in places with high @entity14 populations such as @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
over the next several generations , the wave of minority voters -- who , according to @entity42 @entity177 figures released earlier this year , now represent more than half of the nation 's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in places like @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			2
that hold will extend across the @entity190 all the way to @entity192 , experts say			2
the coming political revolution could result in a massive changing of the guard on nearly every level of government , potential cultural clashes from big cities to rural towns , and the type of political alliances that are now considered rare			2
" i do think that the era that began with @entity205 where there was a conservative dominance powered by conservative voters and @entity211 whites			0
that era is over , " said @entity212 , a senior political analyst , at the @entity213			2
" any candidate that wants to run a campaign [ now ] only at whites is going to lose			0
" @entity5 problem : ' their voters are white , aging and dying off ' @entity9 failed to deliver on a first - term pledge to tackle comprehensive immigration reform			1
so moving forward , legislative battles over immigration will test the newfound political sway of minorities and the @entity5 's ability to redirect on the issue , said @entity229 , an associate professor of political science at @entity231 in @entity232			1
" this will be a test on whether or not @entity5 get the message , " @entity229 said , adding , " strategically , @entity9 needs to identify pro-immigration @entity5 and get them on board pretty quickly			1
he 's got to figure out which republicans are hip and realize the game has got to change on immigration and help protect them ( so ) they feel comfortable enough to defect			1
" both parties will also work with a @entity244 that has seen more women added to its ranks			1
how women ruled the 2012 election and where the @entity5 went wrong in @entity244 , a record 20 women will hold @entity252 seats next yearâ € ” including newly - elected @entity254 democrat @entity253 , the first openly lesbian senator			1
the @entity257 congressional delegation will be all female and , in @entity9 's home state of @entity259 , democrat @entity255 will represent the islands in the @entity252			0
in @entity262 , @entity5 sen. - elect @entity261 will represent that state			1
however , there are still hurdles to overcome , said @entity266 , director of the @entity267 at @entity268			0
" because of very clear and specific targeting , @entity33 were able to win women , " @entity266 said			2
but , she continued , that " does n't mean that is how they govern			0
moving forward in the direction that will improve women 's social , economic and political autonomy takes time			1
" analysis : @entity9 's new @entity33 majority changes at the local level , too a mix of ballot initiatives across the country suggests that , despite the political power gains among women and minorities , those groups are not always united on issues			1
and in places where those groups are outnumbered , state and local laws may not always favor their causes			0
in @entity173 , voters rejected a proposal that would have blocked state employees from using their health insurance for abortions except in cases of rape , incest or when the woman 's life is threatened			0
in @entity304 , voters passed a measure requiring parental notification before a doctor can perform an abortion on a minor aged 16 or younger			0
in @entity310 , voters overwhelmingly passed a state version of the @entity312 allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in - state tuition			0
in @entity304 , roughly 80 % of voters approved blocking illegal immigrants from getting such state services as student aid and disability benefits			0
@entity310 and @entity321 both passed marriage equality initiativesâ € ” a topic that polling suggests is broadly supported among young voters in particular			0
opinion : how @entity5 can attract @entity17 voters the @entity328 , a group which targets non-college , minority youth and encourages them to vote , is especially excited by the demographic sea change			1
over the next several election cycles , voters can expect to see topics such as immigration reform , climate change , marriage equality and improving juvenile incarceration rates become more of the public policy conversation , said the group 's executive director @entity341			1
" young people are extremely concerned about climate science and climate change ...			2
a smart elected official will try and connect that with jobs packages , @entity341 said			0
" there needs to be a big conversation about marriage equality			2
young people are more tolerant of marriage equality			0
" as for @entity2 , he 's feeling a bit better following thursday night 's @entity357 dinner designed to reach out to @entity38			0
after all , he was once a @entity358 who switched to the @entity5 after realizing the party was most closely aligned with his own views on abortion , guns and taxes			1
he 's feeling a bit better that maybe others can be convinced to do likewise			0
" the last two days , i 've been down in the dumps about this election , " he said			0
" but today i 'm excited			0
we do n't have to move a mountain here , we just have to move a little bit			0
" @entity373 : @entity5 routed by reality			1

the demographic sea change in political power is here , experts say
political gains among women , youth , and minorities will help shape the political conversation
@entity5 say they will have to figure out how to work with , attract these newly powerful @entity50
