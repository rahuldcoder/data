when @entity1 collapsed at her desk in 2007 , she woke to find herself covered in a pool of blood			1
sporting a broken cheekbone from the fall , the incident spurred the editor - in - chief to sit up and rethink her workaholic lifestyle			2
since then , @entity1 has made it her mission to raise awareness around work - life balance with her " sleep evangelist " mantra infused across the @entity17 website			1
from her " @entity24 " app to installing nap rooms inside her @entity21 headquarters , it 's rare for the media mogul not to mention sleep deprivation in tv appearances or her weekly editor 's note			1
@entity31 anchor @entity30 sat down with @entity1 to discuss redefining success as outlined in her new book " thrive : the @entity34 to @entity35 and creating a @entity36			1
" " it 's very important to recognize [ burnout ] is a global phenomenon			1
i was in @entity41 recently where we also have @entity17			2
stress and burnout are much worse there than in the @entity46			2
people consume alcohol four times as much as a way to alleviate stress ; 40 people commit suicide a day			0
you go to @entity54 , and stress is now a daily topic of conversation because people have paid such a price			0
" " i believe we need to define success beyond the two metrics of money and power			1
[ we need ] to include a third metric that incorporates our health , well - being and wisdom			0

" " nothing kills creativity more than burnout			1
so in fact , the best thing we can do for our careers is to foster and nurture that creativity and that effectiveness ... there is absolutely no trade off between doing well in our jobs and taking care of our own human capital			1
" " the situation is changing			0

" " introducing even five minutes of meditation			0
now meditation is really our quiet time			0
it is time to unplug from all our devices , unplug from the world ... all my smartphones , my @entity105 , whatever i have is outside my bedroom			0
