@entity0 , @entity1 -- looking for a weekend escape from the city , @entity3 and her husband fell in love at first sight with a log home in @entity0 and bought it for less than $ 300,000			1
five years on , a weekly 90 - minute drive from their downtown apartment to the house has long been the norm			2
they enjoy gardening , barbecuing or simply relaxing in their getaway surrounded by mountains -- but often shrouded in @entity22 's infamous smog			2
yes , the couple 's three - bedroom weekend home lies on the outskirts of the @entity1 capital -- thousands of miles away from the original @entity0 valley in the @entity30 state of @entity31 , which is known for its breathtaking natural beauty			1
the @entity33 is more crowded , containing some 1,000 single - family houses inspired by rustic lodges in the @entity30 frontier			1
still , wealthy locals are lured to this sprawling development by the promise of living in the " @entity40			0
" after driving past security guards in cowboy outfits patrolling " @entity45 " on golf carts , @entity3 's husband @entity41 pulled over their suv at the end of a @entity48 one recent sunday			0
opening the door to a world of @entity52 , @entity3 and @entity53 -- both lawyers in @entity22 -- proudly displayed their fondness for the @entity30 by adding personal touches to the built - in furniture and decoration that evoke the @entity40			1
she studied and worked in @entity60 for two years from 2003 to 2005 , during which time he visited			0
adorning the earthy - toned walls are colorful license plates from the @entity30 states -- including @entity31 -- they have traveled to and a large framed copy of the @entity67			1
" we want more freedom , " said @entity3 , 40 , pointing to the framed copy she bought in @entity69			0
" this is a milestone -- ( we hang it here ) partially for the history , partially for our profession			0
" " many people have been to the @entity30 and enjoy the environment there , " @entity53 , 55 , added			2
" those who have n't think this place is authentic @entity30 and they like it			2
" that 's proven to be a great selling point for developer @entity80 since he -- with the help of an @entity30 designer -- launched the @entity0 project a decade ago			1
he has sold almost all the houses , and seen the property value double over the years with the bigger homes now fetching $ 1 million each			1
official data shows that a typical urban resident in @entity1 earned less than $ 4,000 in 2012			2
@entity3 -- who is not related to the developer -- and her husband feel pleased about their purchase as early believers , and bought a second , bigger house here last year			0
they say other homeowners share their appreciation for the @entity30 culture and values that are reflected in the architecture and setting , despite frequent news reports on rising tensions between the two nations			0
" we like the @entity30 and we like the lifestyle , " @entity3 said			0
" let the governments worry about the things that should be worried about by them			0
" her sentiment echoes the most recent results of an annual survey on @entity1 people 's attitude towards the @entity30 by the @entity115 , a @entity116 - based think tank			1
although the @entity115 study finds @entity1 public perceptions of the @entity30 becoming less favorable in 2012 , it notes : " there is one constant : richer , younger , more educated , and urban @entity1 all express a more positive view of ( the soft power ) aspects of @entity30 's image			1
and this also holds true for overall ratings of the @entity30 " developer @entity3 is a fan of the @entity30 as well , overseeing construction for the next phase on his 70 - square - kilometer lot -- the size of 13,000 american football fields			2
his plans include 2,000 townhouses mimicking the feel of @entity138 , a scenic coastal town in northern @entity139 , and a winery that he says will rival @entity142 in ten years			0
in between sipping wine and chatting with residents at a lunch gathering on site , the 51 - year - old businessman from the central @entity145 province reflects on his corporate mission			0
" for those who can afford to buy houses here , they have enough money , " he explained			0
" they want spiritual fulfillment			0
" for that , the developer has built a brand new church in the center of his town -- next to a row of small shops , bars and cafes -- serving residents like @entity3 , who embraced @entity167 as a graduate student in the @entity30			1
" this is an ' @entity30 ' community so it 's a necessary element here , " said @entity3 as she walked out of the soon - to - open @entity0 church			1
although she misses the natural beauty and cultural diversity of the @entity30 , @entity3 says she never hesitated about returning to the motherland because of her and her husband 's career aspirations and their roots			2
now comfortably settled at work and home back in @entity1 , where the @entity182 leadership is proclaiming national revival as the ultimate @entity1 dream , @entity3 feels she has n't completely abandoned the @entity184 -- as she and her fellow residents in this fictional @entity30 town pursue their freedom and happiness every weekend .			1
