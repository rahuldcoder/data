@entity3 @entity0 , the wife of former @entity2 presidential nominee @entity1 , condemned @entity8 gov. @entity7 's @entity6 challenger after he mistakenly called her a " whore " — and then chuckled			1
" when i first heard about it , it hit me right in my gut , " @entity1 said in a monday phone interview with @entity4			1
" my nerve endings went haywire			2
it 's so upsetting when you know someone can say something like that about a woman , and not have any kind of reaction			2
@entity7 is a great girl and has been a great governor			1
" the @entity25 , @entity26 , made the comment at a campaign event late last week in @entity29			2
in the midst of attacking @entity7 's education record , @entity26 stumbled over his words and told the crowd , " we are going to escort whore out the door			2
" the slip - of - the - tongue was clearly accidental , and @entity26 immediately corrected himself , saying , " we 're going to escort her out the door			0
" but when some in the audience picked up on the verbal faux pas and started applauding , @entity26 grinned and laughed along with people in the crowd			0
video of the event went viral			0
@entity26 apologized for the moment in a radio interview on monday			0
" but if anybody heard , and certainly my words were garbled ... i apologize because i do n't want to send that message to anybody , " he said , according to @entity56 newspaper			1
@entity7 leads @entity26 by double digits in recent polling and is expected to win a second term next week			0
@entity1 , who came to know @entity7 during the 2012 presidential campaign when she was one of the @entity1 's top @entity2 supporters , said she spoke to the governor by phone about the flare - up			1
@entity1 said the incident is discouraging to women who want to be in the political arena			1
@entity7 , she noted , weathered attacks on her personal life and her @entity72 - @entity71 heritage in past campaigns			0
" we need to make sure we have a safe place so that other women can feel like they can do this and these kinds of things are n't going to happen to them , " @entity1 said			1
" you get so sick of saying there is bias out there , but if a @entity2 had said this , it would be blowing up in their face like nobody 's business			0
where is @entity90 ? where is @entity92 ? where are they ? " @entity1 aides made her available for an interview on @entity26 's comments			1
her remarks come amid heightened interest in whether her husband will launch a third bid for the @entity104			2
she said the family has no timeline for making a decision			0
" a lot of people are talking about it , but honestly @entity1 and i are n't , " @entity1 said			1

we do n't see them changing			2
but you are never going to say never			0
right now we are looking to see these other candidates come forward			0
" @entity0 still done with 2016 , but never say never she offered a larger critique of the so - called @entity2 " war on women " — a campaign strategy that @entity6 used to devastating effect against @entity1 in 2012			1
@entity1 argued that the message has lost its potency in 2014 , though @entity6 say women 's issues have kept them in the hunt in several tight @entity127 races from @entity128 to @entity129			1
" people are saying , this is n't working anymore , " @entity1 said			1
" it was a ploy in the last election			0
i think they thought it was effective , and they are trying again this cycle			0
but i hope the electorate is getting tired of these broad brush statements that work on people 's emotions , that are inaccurate , that try to marginalize one candidate or another			2
i get even more upset when i see other women trying to use these tactics and approaches			0
we have to be better than that			0
" @entity1 said women voters care about a broad array of issues — national security , the economy , education — beyond just social issues like abortion rights and access to contraception .			1

@entity0 is *slamming* a slur uttered by a @entity6 candidate for @entity8 governor
@entity1 to @entity4 : " it hit me right in my gut :
