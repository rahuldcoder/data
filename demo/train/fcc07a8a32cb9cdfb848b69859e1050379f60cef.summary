-- @entity1 came early this year for pimps and johns in @entity4			1
last week 's unanimous decision by the @entity7 to strike down all remaining prostitution laws is not only a victory for the professional sex workers who brought their case through the legal system , it is a triumph for those who live off and enjoy the commercial sex industry			1
tragically , it 's a time bomb for hundreds of thousands of vulnerable and exploited women , girls and boys			1
we are documentary filmmakers and our film , " tricked " , opened last week in @entity20			1
for 3 years , we embedded with vice cops , met with the johns , pimps , girls and boys entangled in the professional sex world			0
we went to the dungeon of a dominatrix , filmed the partially legal model in @entity29 and met sex workers advocating for legalization			1
we followed abolitionists , lobbyists , hobbyists , survivors , the @entity36 , grandmothers , gay sex workers , transvestites , drug addicts , alcoholics , college kids and @entity43			0
all had stories to share and a unique perspective on this complex issue			0
by the end of our extensive investigation , focused on the @entity49 , we shared a conclusion : the commercial sexual sale of someone 's body is not empowering , does not offer gender equality and in most cases is a form of modern day slavery			1
the myths used by advocates of prostitution are universal			1
the selling of sex is legal in @entity4 , but the decision ended prohibitions on operating brothels , making a living from working for a prostitute and communicating in public about prostitution			1
while striking down these three laws arguably protects the constitutional rights of a certain class of sex worker , it does so at the expense of another more plentiful group : those harmed by the sex industry			0
efforts to legalize prostitution are based on the outdated assumption that prostitution is a victimless crime , a view that is effectively used by the pro-legalization lobby			1
that 's simply not true			1
for the majority of commercial sex workers , the sex industry is a continuum of harm that feeds on vulnerabilities and spits out damaged victims			1
in the @entity49 the @entity36 estimates that 85 % of commercial sex workers experience some degree of force , fraud or coercion ( the federal definition of sex trafficking )			1
there is no definitive evidence that legalization ends the exploitation of sex workers			0
according to several undercover cops we interviewed , a majority of girls have pimps in the legal brothels of @entity112			2
most of the girls and women we filmed worked " legitimate " escort services for their pimps			0
@entity119 did escort work by day and street work by night -- all her money went to her pimp			2
in @entity125 , @entity124 worked through licensed escort businesses but had to hand over all her earnings to a violent and controlling pimp			0
legalization could potentially cut down on violence by johns , but it can not control the violence outside brothel walls			0
another myth often cited by supporters of legalization is that there is a health care benefit , but recent statistics from @entity139 , where prostitution is legal , show that less than one tenth of 1 % of sex workers actually use the health insurance system			1
throughout the sex industry , we found a strong dominance of pimp culture			0
where pimps operate , most take 100 % of the money earned by the sex workers			0
for them , there 's a strong financial incentive to continue business as usual			2
would legalization change this truth or eliminate pimps ? commercial sex workers face violence , whether in brothels or at " home " with a pimp			0
according to one study , working in prostitution is 51 times more violent than the second-most violent profession for women ( working in a liquor store )			2
sex workers said they had been subjected to beatings , knifings and rape			0
worse than the physical abuse is the ongoing trauma			0
years later , those we interviewed struggle with @entity178 , chronic pelvic disease , the repercussions of forced abortions , depression , drug addiction , self - mutilation and shame			0
we need a comprehensive approach to the sex industry that involves social workers , law enforcement , employers , politicians and citizens as a whole			0
the first step is to recognize the harm that naturally occurs in the sex industry			2
the second step is to establish support systems to help victims overcome their traumas and become survivors			1
and third , we need to stop future victimization by combating the vulnerabilities in our youth			0
the current evil in the system preys on the vulnerable among us			2
prostitution is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world , but legalization and decriminalization is not the answer			2
the @entity4 decision ignores the most important part of the sex industry dilemma : the victims and those adrift in harm 's way			1
the rights of the small percentage of voluntary sex workers should not take precedence over the lives , bodies and souls of those who are forced to work in prostitution as sex slaves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			2

filmmakers say their work documents the harm that prostitution does
a @entity4 court recently struck down the remaining legal curbs on prostitution
authors : do *n't* believe it 's a victimless crime ; force , fraud or coercion frequently used
they say we need support systems for victims , ways to protect the vulnerable
