a bipartisan agreement giving @entity8 budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts cleared the chamber unanimously			1
" it will be good news for @entity17 's traveling public if @entity18 spares them these unnecessary delays , " @entity13 spokesman @entity12 said			2
" but ultimately , this is no more than a temporary @entity22 that fails to address the overarching threat to our economy posed by the sequester 's mindless across the board cuts			1
" the @entity13 was expected to take up the proposal on friday			2
the plan also would allow authorities to protect 149 control towers at small and medium - sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons			2
