-- unless you have a photographic memory or just joined @entity3 last week , you probably do n't recall your first tweet			1
@entity3 would like to show it to you			2
to commemorate friday 's eighth anniversary of the first @entity3 message , @entity3 has introduced a tool that lets users relive their @entity3 debuts			1
type your @entity3 handle into the search field and it spits out your first - ever tweet in its full , date - stamped glory -- typos , clever witticisms , clumsy hashtags and all			1
you can also look up the first tweet of any other user , from @entity23 star @entity22 ( " the antisocial has become social # mambatweets " ) to billionaire @entity26 ( " @entity26 is in the house " )			2
previously , if you wanted to find someone 's old messages on @entity3 you had to scour @entity30 ( if they 're famous ) , do a cumbersome @entity3 search , try a social - search tool such as @entity33 or -- heaven forbid -- scroll back through hundreds , even thousands , of tweets			1
based on a quick review of notable # @entity39 ( yes , it 's a trending topic now ) , many people seemed a little unsure in the beginning about this newfangled @entity3 thing			1
take @entity45 skier @entity44 , whose first tweet in 2009 said , " just started this tweety bird thing ... we 'll see how it goes			0
" @entity44 has since tweeted 1,850 more times			0
guess she got the hang of it			0
the first - ever tweet from @entity0 's breaking - news account in 2007 was n't news at all ( see below ) , although @entity0 did n't actually own the account at the time			0
on march 21 , 2006 , the first @entity3 message was published by @entity3 co-founder @entity59 , who wrote , " just setting up my twttr			1
" @entity3 did n't launch to the public until july of that year , but grew steadily as it became recognized as a speedy source for news			0
