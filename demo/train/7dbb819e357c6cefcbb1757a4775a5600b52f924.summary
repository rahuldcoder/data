-- it may be tough to teach old dogs new tricks , but perhaps they can learn to live in new houses			2
@entity5 graphic designer and curator @entity4 has made it his mission to find out			1
debuting at @entity9 in early december , in collaboration with a star - studded cast of designers and architects from @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity5 , this online venture supplies free blueprints for 13 different @entity19 doghouses , each one earmarked for a particular breed			1
@entity4 hopes that pet enthusiasts everywhere will build them and that their photos will go viral and kickstart an online architectural discourse about the designs when the website launches this month			1
@entity4 has been mulling over the idea of designer doghouses for around 15 years , and the project finally caught the attention of @entity14 investors at @entity32 knew the pet - related theme would be popular , he said , ' i have the impression that the whole world is interested in babies and dogs			1
' building on the " man 's best friend " bond , he started by matching designers to dogs , choosing only small breeds that like to live inside			2
some are random pairings , such as the dachshund with architects @entity50 and the @entity52 with product designer @entity53 , but others are special requests , like architect @entity56 who wanted to build for his own @entity57 , and @entity58 who was keen to make a new home for a client 's @entity60			2
because conversation with their canine clients could be a bit one - sided , @entity4 provided each designer with a dossier of information covering the physical characteristics , temperament and health concerns of their breed			1
human needs were considered in the brief , too , which stipulated that the doghouses should be easy for anyone to assemble with ordinary household tools and materials			2
more from wallpaper * : @entity80 in pictures - 50 great buildings leading the pack , @entity4 launched the project by designing two doghouses of his own : a hard , paper cone suspended from the ceiling for a @entity5 terrier and a plywood contraption for a @entity91			1
intended to improve contact between pooch and person , the poodle 's structure consists of a 70cm - high , wedge - shaped wooden tunnel enclosing a puppy - sized run of stairs			0
they lead up to a platform at chair height where the dog can recline while gazing adoringly at their owner			2
" putting a dog on the table is not so good , " says @entity4			1
" yet the floor is a little too far away			0
" located between these two extremes , @entity4 's proposal may have conceptual merit			1
but it took lots of @entity114 to coax a live poodle up the stairs			0
this reaction is not much of a surprise since the actual dogs did not participate much during the design phase			2
and when they did , many were more challenging than human clients			0
architect @entity124 's subject , a @entity125 rented at a @entity127 dog park , refused to even go inside the prototype			2
scrapping that sphere - shaped model , @entity124 devised an open - frame structure instead , reminiscent of his @entity131			0
most designers started by presenting a conceptual sketch to @entity4 and his staff who then investigated ways to realize the projects			1
" architects are very busy so we tried to provide ideas for materials and construction methods , " explains @entity4			1
like a fast - paced game of fetch , ideas moved back and forth between the designers and team @entity4			1
sometimes it took four or five months to develop a realistic solution -- more time than required for many full - fledged buildings			0
and even then certain proposals , such as @entity56 's inflatable , vinyl roof worn on the dog 's back , still proved unbuildable			0

the pritzker - prize winner had little time to spare , but knew that she wanted to create something fluffy for her assistant 's fuzzy white pup			0
running with her idea , @entity4 's group began exploring soft materials and ways to support them			1
in due course , all agreed on a curved wooden frame enrobed by a hand - knitted cover			0
though it bears little resemblance to the minimalist , glass buildings that have made @entity159 famous , her doghouse got a warm reception from its canine resident who crawled inside and took an immediate liking to the soft , protective shell			0
the @entity127 architecture firm @entity186 also sincerely considered the needs of its @entity188 , creating an easy - to - build , simple structure that recycles old clothes			0
resembling a hammock , it consists of a wooden frame that supports an old t - shirt , preferably one well worn by the dog 's owner			0
" the smell of the owner is very , very important for a dog , " says @entity4			1
' " t makes the dog feel safe and want to be here			0
" but a pooch 's response is only one measure of success			0
" architecture for dogs is not a pet 's project , " explains @entity4			1
" it is a project for architects			0
" for that reason , he engaged @entity213 , one of @entity5 's leading web designers , to create the interactive , trilingual website where participants can download drawings and view instructional videos , as well as upload photos of their newly built pet palaces , showcasing customizations and material substitutions			2
" one idea can create lots of architecture around the world , " says @entity4			1
and potentially turn @entity227 into a catalyst for architectural invention			1
