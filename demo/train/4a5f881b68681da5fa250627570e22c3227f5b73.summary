and our reaction to the failed plot is failing as well , by focusing on the specifics of this made - for - a - movie plot rather than the broad threat			1
while our reaction is predictable , it 's not going to make us safer			1
we 're going to beef up airport security , because @entity1 allegedly snuck a bomb through a security checkpoint			1
we 're going to intensively screen @entity13 , because he is @entity13			2
we 're going to field full body scanners , because they might have noticed the petn that authorities say was hidden in his underwear			2
we 're doing these things even though security worked			1
the security checkpoints , even at their pre- 9/11 levels , forced whoever made the bomb to construct a much worse bomb than he would have otherwise			1
instead of using a timer or a plunger or another reliable detonation mechanism , as would any commercial user of @entity16 , he had to resort to an ad hoc homebrew -- and a much more inefficient one , involving a syringe , and 20 minutes in the lavatory , and we do n't know exactly what else -- that did n't explode			2
at that point , @entity1 's fellow passengers quickly subdued him			2
yes , the screeners did n't notice any petn in his underwear , but the system was never intended to catch that particular tactic			1
there probably were intelligence failures -- why was n't his father 's tip followed up on , and why was n't his visa revoked ? -- but it 's always easy to connect the dots in hindsight			2
we 're doing these things even though this particular plot was chosen precisely because we were n't screening for it ; future @entity55 attacks rarely look like past attacks ; and the terrorist threat is far broader than attacks against airplanes			2
we 're doing these things even though airplane terrorism is incredibly rare , the risk is no greater today than it was in previous decades , the taxi to the airport is still more dangerous than the flight , and ten times as many @entity66 are killed by lightning as by terrorists			2
in fact , we 're focusing on the specifics of the plot , not despite these facts , but because of them			1
the @entity1 is precisely the sort of story we humans tend to overreact to			1
our brains are n't very good at probability and risk analysis , especially when it comes to rare events			2
our brains are much better at processing the simple risks we 've had to deal with throughout most of our species ' existence , and much poorer at evaluating the complex risks modern society forces us to face			1
we exaggerate spectacular rare events , and downplay familiar and common ones			2
we can see the effects of this all the time			0
we fear being murdered , kidnapped , raped and assaulted by strangers , when it 's far more likely that the perpetrator of such offenses is a relative or a friend			0
we fear school shootings , even though a school is almost always the safest place a child can be			0
we worry about shark attacks instead of fatal dog or pig attacks -- both far more common			0
in the @entity66 , over 38,000 people die each year in car crashes ; that 's as many deaths as 9/11 each and every month , year after year			1
overreacting to the rare and spectacular is natural			0
we tend to base risk analysis on personal story rather than on data			1
if a friend gets mugged in a foreign country , that story is more likely to affect how safe you feel in that country than abstract crime statistics			0
we give storytellers we have a relationship with more credibility than we give strangers , and stories that are close to us more weight than stories from foreign lands			0
and who is everyone 's major storyteller these days ? @entity127			0
i tell people that if it 's in the news , do n't worry about it			1
the very definition of " news " is " something that hardly ever happens			0
" it 's when something is n't in the news , when it 's so common that it 's no longer news -- car crashes , domestic violence -- that you should start worrying			0
but that 's not the way we think			0
the more an event is talked about , the more probable we think it is			0
the more vivid our thoughts about the event are -- again , think television -- the more easily we remember it and the more convincing it is			0
so when faced with a very available and highly vivid event like the @entity1 , 9/11 , or a child kidnapping in a playground , we overreact			0
and once we 're scared , we need to " do something " -- even if that something does n't make sense and is ineffective			1
we need to do something directly related to the story that 's making us scared			0
we implement full body scanners at airports			0
we do n't let our children go to playgrounds unsupervised			0
instead of implementing effective , but more general , security measures to reduce the overall risk , we concentrate on making the fearful story go away			1
yes , it 's security theater , but it makes us feel safer			1
as circular as it sounds , rare events are rare primarily because they do n't occur very often , and not because of any preventive security measures			1
if you want to do something that makes security sense , figure out what 's common among a bunch of rare events , and concentrate your countermeasures there			1
focus on the general risk of terrorism , and not the specific threat of airplane bombings using @entity16 - filled underwear			0
focus on the general risk of troubled teens , and not the specific threat of a lone gunman wandering around a school			0
ignore the movie - plot threats , and concentrate on the real risks			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			1

@entity189 says the reaction to the failed bombing is *wrongheaded*
he says people tend to look for quick *solutions* to remote risks
he says focusing on how to prevent the last attack makes no sense
in this case , he says , the security system actually *foiled* the bombing
