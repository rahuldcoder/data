-- in the old days , being passive - aggressive took effort			0
an annoyance -- like , say , a neighbor who has elected to make the stairwell his own personal broom closet -- would fester and fester until one was finally forced into action			0
@entity7 , leaving a note to the effect of : " hi ! i tripped over a bucket of liquid in the hallway and turned my ankle			0
therefore , i elected to remove your garbage from our common area -- for the sake of everyone 's safety			1
@entity23 can hear you have sex through the wall			0
" now , it 's all too easy to vent your frustrations via @entity29 , @entity30 and various and sundry meme machines , cluttering the newsfeeds of friends and " @entity30 friends " with your petty , petty gripes			1
we get it : sometimes you just need to scream silently into your pillow , and since one does not always have a pillow on hand ( unless one rolls like that ) , the @entity39 is often the closest substitute			0
still , it is vital to realize that you are not , in fact , bellowing into the ether about your co-worker 's apparent lack of breathing - through - the - nose skills -- no , you are recording these grievances for all to see , laugh at and possibly garner a book deal via passive - aggressive notes			1
thankfully , the @entity39 ( and its outlying regions ) is an innovative place , and now it 's possible to get passive - aggressive ( and even outright aggressive ) without spreading your lack of sunshine to the rest of your social network			2
here 's what to do : when your friends are being all foe - like the other weekend , you had a rather unfortunate drunken experience with a fire extinguisher at a local music venue			1
the next day , you confided in your friend -- let 's call him " @entity69 " -- who immediately appropriated the venue 's security camera footage and posted your incriminating , foamy dance ( you were belting out a stirring rendition of " @entity76 , " you now recall ) to @entity75			2
you became a viral star ! -- for all the wrong reasons			0
angrily , you take to @entity30 and start posting messages akin to , " @entity80 ! " sorry to break it to you , dude , but acting out digitally in this way makes you look like a giant loser -- not that you needed any help in the first place			1
naturally , you should probably confront your friend , but if you ca n't manage to summon up the balls to do so , might we suggest downloading @entity89 , an @entity91 game that allows you to blast your @entity30 friends in effigy as if they were malignant aliens from outer space			1
" @entity69 " will never know what hit him -- unless you manage to get your hands on another fire extinguisher			0
when your beau is being a schmo so here 's the thing			2
everything about you and your girlfriend makes us intensely uncomfortable : the way you ( wetly ) make out in public , the way you lick sauce off of each other 's face while eating , and , especially , the way you get into raging fights in public locations and then retreat into the nearest restroom to " make up			1
" and when you port all of that over into the digital realm , snipping about fights and seeking support from your friends ( " he 's just not good enough for you , girl ! " ) we 're just that much more embarrassed for you because it 's all out there for anyone to see ( @entity124 is watching )			1
luckily , someone has gone and created an application called @entity127 especially for couples , allowing @entity129 to share pictures , videos , texts and drawings with each other -- and each other alone			0
so the next time you feel tempted to bring up @entity137 's inability to purchase @entity138 via incensed tweet , snap a pic of the naked roll and send it along to @entity142 instead			2
bonus : the app also has a " thumb kiss " feature that causes the phone to vibrate when both couples touch their appendages to their screens at the same time			0
it 's like really discreet makeup sex			2
@entity153 : this app is intended to be used by happy couples , but we 're cynics			0
when your boss is eating your soul wait until you get home and pull out the aforementioned pillow			2
while we 're all about free speech and all that , it 's just basically a bad idea to post anything disparaging about your boss or workplace online			1
why ? because you never know who has access to your social accounts -- a lot of workplaces are even asking for @entity30 logins nowadays ( a practice that we wholly do not endorse )			1
if you 're that upset about your current work situation , by all means get smashed and complain about it with friends ( after looking over your shoulder , of course )			0
but after you 've recovered from your hangover , maybe start looking for another gig			0
if you must let off some steam , try firing up @entity186 , a @entity30 app that allows you to declare friends or public figures " enemies			1
" we hear @entity192 is a popular enemy , and there 's slim to no chance he 's your boss .			1

@entity89 is an @entity91 game that allows you to blast your @entity30 friends in effigy
it 's always a bad idea to post anything disparaging about your boss or workplace online
@entity206 allows you to declare friends or public figures " enemies "
