@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has signed its first major oil deal with a foreign company since the fall of @entity9 's regime , a spokesman for the @entity4 said saturday			1
@entity1 's oil fields currently produce about 2.5 million barrels a day			1
it was the first time in more than 35 years that @entity1 has allowed foreign oil companies to do business inside its borders			2
the contract with the @entity16 could be worth up to $ 3 billion			1
it would allow the @entity16 to develop an oil field in southern @entity1 's @entity21 province for about 20 years , @entity4 spokesman @entity17 said			1
@entity1 's @entity22 must still approve the contract , but @entity24 said that would happen soon and work could start within a few months			0
