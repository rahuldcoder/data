she is a @entity5 writer and media consultant whose blog , @entity8 , explores how people communicate in the online age			0
as @entity12 and other wireless providers move away from offering unlimited data plans , many smartphone owners want to better understand their own wireless data usage to avoid racking up surprise charges			0
while you can log on to your wireless carrier account to check how much data you 've used so far during the current billing period , you often ca n't tell how much data each type of mobile activity consumes			1
recently in @entity24 , @entity25 of @entity26 ( a wireless market research and analysis firm ) offered a table of smartphone data usage by mobile activity			1
she estimates that if you generally send or receive 20 e-mails on your smartphone daily ( no attachments ) , that 's probably about 0.01 gb of data usage over the course of one month			2
bumping that up to about 70 no - attachment e-mails sent or received daily uses about 0.04 gb per month			0
viewing an average of 20 web pages on your smartphone per a day would consume about 0.11 gb in a month , according to @entity25			1
watching 20 minutes of mobile video per day uses about 1.14 gb per month			2
an hour of streaming mobile music per day uses about 0.86 gb per month			0
@entity25 's benchmarks can help you plan a mobile " diet " that wo n't bust your budget			1
she based these estimates on data from @entity12 smartphone users , and not all smartphones and carrier networks are created equally			0
but it helps to know which mobile activities generally are more data - heavy , so you know what to cut back on to keep your wireless bill under control			0
what 's a " normal " level of mobile data usage ? according to @entity25 , an average residential ( non-business ) smartphone user consumes about this much data per day : fewer than 10 e-mails sent / received ( no attachments ) = 2.5 mb 1 e-mail with photo attachment = 10 mb 3 e-mails sent / received ( with other attachment ) = 12 mb 5 minutes of streaming music per day ( about 2.5 hours per month ) = 72 mb 5 web pages visited = 25 mb 0 - 1 applications downloaded ( games / songs ) = 60 mb 10 social media posts per day = 14 mb 1 minute of streaming video per day ( about 30 minutes per month ) = 60 mb over the course of a month , that adds up to @entity84 ( about a quarter of a gigabyte ) on average -- but that 's just for mobile content			1
mobile access to data also entails considerable overhead , and consumers pay for that , too			0
the smallest of @entity12 's new data plans gives mobile users @entity95 of data per month for $ 15			2
the " @entity98 " plan gives people 2 gigabytes of data -- about 10 times more -- for $ 25 per month			0
" signaling traffic " is how smartphones keep in touch with wireless data networks and move between cells			1
@entity25 explains that the growing problem of wireless network congestion comes mostly from smartphones constantly querying the network as they move among cell sites			2
this means that you 're racking up some data usage anytime your smartphone is on			0
according to @entity25 , " while data traffic is also growing , signaling traffic is outpacing actual mobile data traffic by 30 percent to 50 percent , if not more			1
" there 's not much that consumers can do to control the amount of signaling traffic from their smartphones -- aside from simply turning your phone off or operating it in " airplane mode " when you do n't need online access or incoming calls			1
however , mobile content usage is something that you can control .			0

one expert 's benchmarks can help you plan a mobile " diet " that wo n't bust your budget
@entity25 : an average residential smartphone user consumes about 255.5 mb per month
consumers ca n't do much to control the amount of signaling traffic from their smartphones
