-- the offices of @entity2 , a nationwide coalition of girls - only programs , were abuzz monday as news spread about @entity7 's decision to allow female members for the first time in its 80 - year history			1
" shock " was a common sentiment , the organization 's executive director said , not because the famed @entity7 , @entity16 , club finally decided to open its doors to another gender , but because they had n't done so until now			1
" the girls honestly were pretty surprised that @entity7 had been discriminating against women like this , " said @entity20 , referring to the teenagers that comprise much of @entity2 's staff			1
" they are horrified that ( the club ) could legally and blatantly ( exclude women )			2
" @entity7 admits first female members most of these girls were in elementary school when women 's rights activist @entity33 first ratcheted up public pressure on what was then probably @entity38 's best known men 's - only club			1
yet the majority of those women 's rights activists responding to monday 's news were well aware of @entity7 's history and that of the decade - long fight to force it to reverse its policy , not to mention the even longer campaign for gender equality			1
for them , hearing former @entity38 secretary of state @entity47 and @entity49 businesswoman @entity48 can now hang out in @entity7 's clubhouse with corporate and other leaders from around the @entity53 and nation was cause for celebration			2
@entity33 admitted that her first reaction , upon hearing of @entity7 chairman @entity60 's statement , was " we won -- and we did			1
" @entity7 admits one of the ' toughest ' women in business " by we , i mean the women 's movement and women in the @entity38 , particularly those in business , " she said			1
but @entity33 , the co-founder of the @entity69 , also admitted feeling personally vindicated			0
she recalled receiving death threats after she began challenging @entity7 's membership policies in 2002 , hoping to give more female leaders an " in " in one of the most exclusive clubs			2
" it was n't a lack of worthy women " that prevented women from being part of the club , said @entity75 , an activist and author who calls herself a friend of @entity33 's			1
" it was really about keeping an old , now outdated power structure in place			0
" many women who had a rooting interest in the fight , albeit not on the frontlines like @entity33 , cheered monday 's announcement			0
they included @entity93 , the tennis player known by some as much for her @entity94 matches with @entity96 as her 39 @entity98 singles and doubles titles			0
membership is latest honor for @entity102 " slowly but surely lots of crumbs ( add ) up to a cake , " she said , on @entity104 , of how the announcement was a milestone in women 's quest for equality			0
others used social media to add a dose of perspective , and humor			0
@entity118 columnist @entity117 was one of a few who suggested that " the ladies ' club championship at @entity7 " -- featuring @entity102 , @entity48 and no one else -- " should be a doozy			2
" then there was satirist @entity125 , who offered a reality check along with his characteristic sarcasm			0
" @entity128 stoked about @entity7 's diversity now that it 's .6 % female , " he wrote on @entity104			2
women 's rights advocates readily admitted the fact the club hosting the prestigious @entity134 golf tournament let two women in does n't mean their effort to achieve gender equality is over , or that even a fraction of women will ever join @entity102 and @entity48 at @entity7			1
that 's especially true when it comes to the makeup of corporate @entity38 's leadership , said @entity75 , a former president of @entity144			0
" it 's a long road ahead because women remain in less than 20 % of the top leadership positions across all sectors of business , " she said			0
still , @entity20 -- from @entity2 , which bills itself as a " girls - fueled activist movement " -- said she feels more optimistic today about opportunities for her young team members and others girls like them than she did before @entity7 's announcement			1
" this just gives them optimism and hope that the world is changing , " @entity20 said			0
" and hopefully , for the next generation , it will be totally unacceptable and intolerable and unprofitable for clubs like that to exclude girls			0
" @entity7 no longer just a ' boys club '			2

@entity7 announces it has admitted women for the first time
an activist who pushed for the change says she feels like " we won "
some online *highlight* the fact that the club is still *overwhelmingly* male
the head of a " girl - fueled activist movement " says the decision gives girls hope
