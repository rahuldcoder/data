-- a 50 - foot - wide , 15 - ton magnet is about to set out on a 3,200 - mile barge - and - truck tour down the @entity3 of the @entity4 , around @entity5 and up from the @entity6 to @entity7 before going to work to measure one of the smallest particles known to science			1
currently at the @entity13 's @entity12 in @entity14 , @entity15 , the massive particle storage ring is scheduled to travel to another @entity13 facility at the @entity17 in the suburbs of @entity7 , where scientists hope it will help more accurately measure the properties of subatomic particles called muons			1
the tiny particles exist for only 2.2 millionths of a second , according to a press release from the @entity12 lab. the massive magnet creates a magnetic field 30,000 times the @entity32 's magnetic field , but is so fragile that the coil it contains ca n't bend more than a tenth of an inch to maintain its current precision			1
the voyage , scheduled to begin on saturday and end in july , will send the metal behemoth on a journey on trucks and barges			1
for safety , when it is on the road it will be traveling about 5 mph , so most of the highway portion will happen at night to limit traffic interference			0
once settled in its new home , the magnet will be part of an experiment measuring what is called in physics the g - 2 ( pronounced the gee minus two ) of the muon			2
the existing measurement is already very precise and one of the most well - defined measurements in physics			2
nearly every physics theory has required it as a baseline , according to @entity17			0
the goal of the new measurement is precision to 140 parts per billion -- the same as measuring the length of a football field to a precision of one - tenth the thickness of a human hair			2
this experiment aims to find a measurement four times more precise than the currently accepted measurement			0
should that value be substantially different from the value current equations predict , it could usher in a new era of particle physics , scientists say			0
@entity17 has a website tracking the location of the magnet at http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/bigmove / .			0

the 50 - foot - wide , 15 - ton magnet is now at a lab on @entity14
it needs to get to a lab near @entity7 , where it will help measure subatomic particles
the barge - and - truck trip will go down the @entity3 , around @entity5 and up from the @entity6
the trip is scheduled to begin saturday
