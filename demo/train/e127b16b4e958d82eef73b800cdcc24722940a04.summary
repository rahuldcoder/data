@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 investigators on saturday picked through the remains of a burned - out nightclub and detained at least five people in the aftermath of an explosive inferno , the result of an alleged misuse of fireworks that claimed more than 100 lives			1
friday night 's fire -- in the @entity15 industrial city of @entity16 -- swept through a party in full swing at the @entity19 , a local nightclub celebrating its eighth year in business			1
the blast and fire engulfed the club , law enforcement officials said , as a performance artist juggled cold - flame pyrotechnical maces			1
as he threw them high in the air , the club 's ceiling caught fire and almost immediately spread on to the wooden walls , cutting off exits			1
people succumbed to smoke inhalation or were trampled attempting to escape the panicky chaos			2
the latest death reports varied , with one count as high as 109			2
around 130 people were injured , authorities said , with dozens were in critical condition and many of them hooked up to artificial lung ventilators			1
authorities have opened a criminal investigation			0
the @entity48 of the @entity1 @entity49 said several people have been detained : two club co-owners , a club manager , the night club art director , and a businessman who provided the fireworks and is now suffering from burns at a hospital			1
" a lot of people were lying on the floor of the club , " according to one young female witness			1
" those of them who breathed were carried out and put in cars			0
the biggest problem was that each ambulance took only one person			0
they did n't take any more			0
we were yelling at doctors , forcing them to take more people at once			2
" @entity73 , a @entity16 municipal official , said city workers were helping distraught relatives , who wanted to know the fate of their loved ones			0
" we work with the victims ' relatives here			2
we give them the information about people who are in hospitals and those who were found dead and recognized by the forensic bureau , " @entity73 said			0
shocked residents placed flowers outside the burned club in memory of the victims , a scene that brought back memories of two other @entity1 deadly club fires -- one in @entity0 in 2007 and the other in @entity96 in 2008			1
the tragedy startled @entity1 , reeling after last week 's derailment of a luxury express train from @entity0 to @entity100			2
that incident -- which killed 26 people and injured more than 100 others -- has been called a terror attack , the most lethal terrorist act outside of @entity1 's troubled @entity106 since 2004			1
but this latest nightclub accident , in the @entity1 heartland around 900 miles east of @entity0 , is believed to have been caused by what one @entity1 official says was the " unsanctioned use of pyrotechnical devices			1

" it was not a terrorist act			0
" in a televised address from his country residence near @entity0 , president @entity121 demanded that those responsible for the accident get the harshest possible punishment			0
