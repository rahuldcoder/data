-- @entity2 companies operating in @entity3 have long underestimated the continent 's consumers , according to a top executive in one of the world 's biggest consumer goods groups			1
@entity10 , executive vice president of @entity11 in @entity3 , said that for a long time multinationals have thought of the vast continent as a " monolithic " market , failing to address its diversity			1
" the @entity3 consumer has been underestimated , underserved and underserviced , " said @entity10			1
" what i mean is we have looked at it a little bit generically , like ' the @entity3 , ' a little bit patronizing generically			0
now we start to take the @entity3 consumer seriously			0
" @entity11 , the maker of brands such as @entity23 and @entity24 , has been active in the continent for more than a century , with a presence in 15 countries and employing thousands of workers there			0

" i 'm almost somewhat ashamed to admit that we are still very much in learning mode about what the differences are within @entity3			0
" @entity10 said that it was becoming increasingly clear that there were major differences between the different countries in the continent			0
" what we now increasingly do is we think much more in terms of sub-clusters , where you have east @entity3 , where you have @entity51 , where you have southern @entity51 , " he said			0
" it is more about how you define the brand mix , how you bring it to the consumer , that we localize and that we make it relevant for the local consumer			0
" a recent survey by @entity59 has identified seven types of consumers that companies targeting @entity3 markets need to be aware of			1
" rather than just a continent , @entity3 must be viewed as 54 separate and distinct countries with a wide array of political , economic , geographical , cultural and social features , " said @entity59 's " the @entity65 " report			1
according to the research firm , there is no " single @entity3 consumer			0
" instead , @entity59 says its seven types of consumers can be grouped in three tiers based on monthly income and average spending			1
in the first tier belong the " @entity80 " and " @entity81 " ( wealthy , urban , well - educated @entity3 with high income and consumer packaged goods spending ( @entity84 ) )			0
the second group is comprised of " @entity86 " and " @entity87 " ( middle aged , mid-income @entity3 with average @entity84 category spend ) , while the third one includes " @entity91 , " " @entity92 " and " @entity93 " ( this is the continent 's biggest tier , consisting of consumers who spend much less than average on @entity84 categories -- see fact box )			2
meanwhile , household spending in @entity3 is projected to increase from $ 860 billion in 2008 to $ 1.4 trillion in 2020 , according to a report by @entity102			2
the growth in spending on consumer goods , telecoms and banking can turn @entity3 's consumers into an increasingly attractive business proposition , creating markets large enough to be appealing for multinational firms , said @entity102			1

he argued that the focus should be on how companies can foster innovation and organizational capability to tap the collective spending power of both the high and low ends of the continent 's consumer market			0
" by having a product that is more affordable you reach down , so certainly you have more consumers in your catchment area , " he said , noting that @entity11 has doubled the number of stores it goes to physically in the last few years to over 400,000			2
" so certainly your products can be found in more places in @entity3 , so you expand your catchment area -- that to us is the real story of our growth in @entity3 at this moment			0
" looking ahead , @entity10 said he was very positive about the continent 's future but warned that there were still many issues that needed to be addressed , citing infrastructure , good governance , corruption and fostering local talent			1
" i 'm very optimistic about @entity3 , but i say it always with a tinge of hesitation because one of the big risks is that we get carried away and therefore forget to talk about the real challenges that are still ahead of it , " he said			2
" we have to keep on talking about the real issues and then i am sure that @entity3 can continue that path that it 's on now , and we will see not only @entity11 but many other companies easily double in size from what they are today			2
