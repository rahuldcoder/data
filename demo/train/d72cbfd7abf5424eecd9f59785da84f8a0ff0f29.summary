@entity0 , @entity1 -- the ongoing @entity4 scandal reached if not its denouement thursday at least its climax with the release of the report prepared under the auspices of former fbi director @entity10			1
the report answers numerous questions about who knew about @entity15 's abuse of children as well as how suspicions , rumors and allegations were handled			2
for many of us the most disturbing element of the report already had been intimated in the press , the role that coach @entity21 played in handling complaints against athletes internally and disregarding both @entity4 's procedures and also the law			1
while charitably one could suggest that @entity21 saw discipline as his role as a coach and mentor , less charitable interpretations also make sense , particularly a desire to maintain the reputation of the program and the income and prestige it brought			0
beyond motives , however , the creation of an environment where discipline took place " off the books " was destined to lead to a collapse at some point			0
unfortunately when this collapse occurred its victims were children			2
news : @entity4 leaders disregarded victims , ' empowered ' @entity15 @entity10 said in releasing his report that the investigation 's " most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of @entity15 's child victims by the most senior leaders at @entity4			1
" " the most powerful men at @entity4 failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who @entity15 victimized , " he said			1
@entity67 , @entity68 , @entity21 and @entity69 never demonstrated , through actions or words , any concern for the safety and well - being of @entity15 's victims until after @entity15 's arrest			0
" that remark , which many of us hoped never to read , speaks directly to the findings of the report and to the organizational and moral failures of @entity4			1
even more directly , the report directly chastises the university 's board of trustees for a failure to exercise its oversight functions and its dereliction in ensuring that it was appropriately and adequately informed of risks to the university			2
not only did the university 's administration not inform to the board about the suspicions of and allegations against @entity15 , the board failed in its responsibility in establishing a system to seek such information			0
most shocking , however , given its legal obligations , was @entity4 's complete dereliction in its responsibilities under express laws , including those mandating reporting and protecting those who bring violations to light			1
news : reactions to @entity4 report flood social media @entity10 's ability to identify and order the moral failings of the university in the most appropriate , empathetic and humane way is admirable			1
he centers his condemnations primarily on the fact that at every level -- the board , the president and @entity21 -- no one expressed any concern for the boys whose lives were devastated by the abuse inflicted upon them by @entity15			0
regardless of the structural , administrative and disciplinary failures at @entity4 , the central moral failing was that the school cared more about its reputation , its football team , and even @entity15 than about his victims			1
the school grossly mis - ordered values and failed to meet its duties			0
what @entity10 has found is most disturbing and depressing			2
a superior institution of higher education and a football program and coach admired for their express commitment to principles proved themselves to have feet of clay and appalling disregard for the safety and security of many innocent children			0
news : key players in @entity4 report @entity4 's failings should be a warning to every organization and to all of us			1
we protect our reputations by doing the right thing , not by hiding our failings			0
indeed , even amid discovery of error and wrongdoing , reputations are enhanced by acknowledging , dealing with them immediately and directly , and working to minimize their recurrence			0
if we can draw a salutary lesson from this scandal , it is that			0
unfortunately , for the innocent child victims of @entity15 's predation , the lesson has come too late			1
maybe , if other organizations take these lessons to heart it will prevent future abuses and save others from becoming victims			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity10 releases report showing failures by @entity4 administrators
@entity181 : the report shows total lack of regard for innocent victims
he says administrators and @entity4 board did *n't* live up to their obligations
lesson is to focus on doing the right thing , not on covering up *misdeeds* , he says
