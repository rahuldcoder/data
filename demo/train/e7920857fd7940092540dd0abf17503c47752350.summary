@entity0 -- it was supposed to be @entity4 presidential nominee @entity3 's night			1
but instead of basking in the afterglow of what many called a solid acceptance speech , the @entity3 campaign is now forced to deal with the aftermath of @entity11 's rambling " empty chair " routine at the @entity12 on thursday night			1
in case you missed it , the octogenarian delivered a 12 - minute ad lib where he unleashed a string of criticisms on an invisible president @entity20 sitting in an empty chair on stage			1
in the process , the actor / director - turned - politician stole @entity3 's thunder on a night when the @entity28 governor was supposed to be the headliner			1
and that 's not good , political watchers say			2
" i thought the idea of an old man talking to a chair was a little weird			1
the bad part of what happened yesterday is that @entity11 in his own way upstaged @entity3 , " said @entity36 , an associate professor of political science at @entity38			1
given the narrow window before the @entity43 -- which begins on tuesday -- @entity11 's performance and the ensuing backlash on social media stole valuable time that the @entity3 campaign could have used to dominate the media cycle			1
" i ca n't decide if it was amazingly clever or just crazy , " said @entity49 , chairman of @entity51 's political science department			2
" twenty - five percent of it is going to be taken up with the @entity11 speech because it 's more interesting			1
" laughter , then confusion when @entity11 walked on stage and began his @entity20 routine , the convention hall erupted in laughter and applause			1
then his performance went viral			2
there were comments from everyone -- befuddled college kids and armchair pundits as well as snarky replies from celebrities			2
" tomorrow you 'll know @entity3 hit it out of the park when the media spends its time talking about @entity11 , " responded conservative radio host @entity70 , who is also a @entity1 contributor			1
the @entity76 handle " @entity77 " popped up within minutes of @entity11 's address , had more than 20,000 followers within an hour and has had more than 45,000 followers in the past 24 hours			1
" i remember when anything was possible			2
like ' invisible presidents , ' " said one tweet from that account			0
however , @ @entity86 has been so popular that visitors to the page have been greeted throughout the day with a message that said " @entity90			0
" ironically , @entity76 accidentally suspended the account likely because an unusual amount of " @ " replies -- mentions about the account online -- triggered automatic spam filters			0
while @entity76 wo n't comment on specific accounts , @ @entity86 appears to be sporadically up and running			0
no laughing matter but with just 67 days before @entity99 , such distractions are no laughing matter , said @entity1 chief political analyst @entity101			0
" i think it was rambling and i think it was a real mistake by the @entity3 campaign			1
i do n't understand how they could really let that happen , " @entity101 said after the speech			0
" i mean , you ca n't exactly give him the hook when he 's -- when he 's on the stage , but you have to set parameters			0
" @entity3 adviser : eastwood a ' great messenger ' senior @entity3 campaign strategist @entity115 downplayed the notion that @entity11 's " improv " would be a distraction to the candidate 's message			1
" the crowd loved it , " @entity115 said , adding that @entity3 had been backstage laughing along with the audience			1
" he thought it was funny			2
" " for him to go out there and to say that there 's a need to change presidents and that he supports @entity3 , and talk about 23 million people out of work as he did , and talk about when someone does n't do their job you need to change , that 's a powerful message , " @entity115 said			2
" he 's a great messenger			0
the guy is an @entity137 treasure			0
" the @entity137 @entity138 , says there are 12.8 million unemployed people , not 23 million			0
@entity11 , a longtime @entity4 , endorsed @entity3 at an @entity142 fundraiser at the beginning of august , where he told reporters that he was backing the @entity4 presidential candidate " because i think the country needs a boost somewhere			1
" he endorsed sen. @entity148 in the 2008 presidential election			0
@entity151 humor columnist @entity150 weighed in friday on @entity11 's unscripted address on @entity1 's " @entity153 " with @entity154			1
" i 've been to eight conventions , that is the best moment i 've ever been to at a convention , " @entity150 said			2
directed at an empty chair , @entity150 wonders how the @entity3 campaign allowed the speech to happen			1
" they 're such a scripted group			0
... i 'd love to hear the pitch that he made where everyone said , ' yes , let 's do that , ' " @entity150 said			0
" you only have a few opportunities in these campaigns to get your message out , " said @entity167 , @entity168 correspondent for @entity169			0
" and we 're all sitting here talking about a somewhat crazy moment by @entity11 rather than what was in @entity3 's speech			1
" " i 'm not sure it really spoke to the critical issues , " added @entity180 congresswoman @entity179 of @entity181			0
" it was a light moment			0
" politicians and others stealing the spotlight or becoming political distractions is nothing new			2
recently , several prominent @entity4 have called on rep. @entity190 to drop out of the @entity192 race after the congressman made statements referring to " legitimate rape , " saying that the @entity4 candidate had become a distraction and liability in the tightly - contested race			1
@entity200 , who some say became a distraction himself just before the former @entity20 administration green jobs czar left the @entity204 in controversy when conservatives linked him to past liberal political statements , offered @entity11 a bit of advice on @entity1 's @entity210 with @entity211 on friday			2
" i feel his pain			0
i 've been that guy , " @entity200 said			0
" my advice is , remember , it gets better			0
" @entity1 political producer @entity216 contributed to this report .			0

actor @entity11 delivered a 12 - minute ad lib to an empty chair during the closing night of the @entity4 convention
some thought the routine was funny , while others called it *bizarre*
the attention following the address *threatens* to shift the spotlight away from @entity3 , the @entity4 candidate
