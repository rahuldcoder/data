" @entity0 , hago siempre lo que quiero ... " @entity1 , the @entity2 athlete and a descendant of @entity5 royalty hums the chorus of the popular @entity2 song @entity8 while he proudly shows off his @entity11 suit photos , which he will wear on the @entity13 slopes at the @entity14			1
. " for me it was never a doubt , i knew that i wanted to ski and to compete for @entity2 ; i was convinced from the beginning that this is my country , " @entity16 told @entity17			1
although he has more @entity21 royalty than @entity2 blood running through his veins , @entity16 is considered " an ambassador in style , " for being the only athlete that will represent @entity2 in the @entity14			1
" it 's a lot of pride and a great responsibility , " said the veteran skier			0
" we ( in @entity2 ) are 100 million people and the only chance we have ( of winning a medal ) is up to me , but we do n't have to look at it like that , you have to see it as i 'm an ambassador of this country , an ambassador with style and a human force that goes beyond the result , " being born in @entity2 was a matter of luck for @entity16 , who is the son of the @entity47 and princess of @entity49 , a century old kingdom that ruled @entity5 -- when there was still a monarchy in that country			1
his father , the late prince @entity54 and mother , princess @entity54 were in @entity2 in a business related trip at the time of their son 's birth			2
in 1981 @entity16 founded the @entity63 of @entity64 and since 1984 he has competed in the @entity14 under @entity2 's flag , participating in @entity66 1988 , @entity67 and @entity68 1994			1
in @entity70 2010 , after a long absence , @entity16 returned to the @entity14 in the disciplines of slalom and giant slalom , when he became the oldest athlete to participate in the @entity14 as a 51 - year - old			1
this year , the priority for the " @entity2 prince " of nearly 55 years , is not achieving results but to create among his countrymen a passion for winter sports			1
" it 's not about monitoring my time , but to be there ; to ignite young people 's dreams that want to do the same , to represent @entity2 in winter or summer , " says @entity16 , who qualified for the games after sneaking into the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) slalom category ranking			1
for his new @entity91 adventure -- he insists it 's the last one -- @entity16 will combine his two passions : the sport and music by wearing a special @entity11 suit			2
a form of folk music from @entity2 , @entity11 songs -- often played on festive occasions by groups of guitar , violin and trumpet performers wearing traditional clothes or wide - brimmed hats -- are sung throughout the country , and have become a key part of regional identity blog : will the @entity14 be safe ? the athlete , who also happens to be a singer , says he will wear his flamboyant uniform to reaffirm his @entity2 pride			1
" i am someone that when i go on stage i think about less important things that , at the end , provide some flavor , that promote a country , that sell an image , sell a story and since i ski , i will not generate much interest and many news for @entity2 ; it is important for @entity2 to be there and for people to value ( the country 's presence ) , " he says			2
@entity2 , a country with little or no tradition in winter sports has slowly increased its presence in these kinds of competitions and in 2012 @entity135 competed in the skeleton category in the @entity137			0
@entity16 believes that the only way to encourage @entity2 athletes to compete in such disciplines is to look beyond borders			1
" many @entity2 live in @entity142 or the @entity143			0
we have to find them ; train them			0
they need to have a certain dexterity ; skiing has to be in their blood ; it has to be something natural for them , " he said			0
although the seasoned athlete recognizes that the monetary costs to practice some winter sports can be prohibitive , @entity16 also believes that it is possible to become involved in the sport if you are " creative " and have a support system			0
whle the build up to @entity13 has had its fair share of negative headlines , @entity16 expressed his regret that the sporting event is being used as a political platform			0
" the games are going to be an influence and @entity169 will realize they have to change , they have created a mega galactic event , everybody will come and celebrate the sport , they deserve it			0
" although @entity174 will be his last event , @entity16 will keep on supporting the young athletes who dream on qualifying for the @entity14 the @entity2 @entity176 reported on its website that the @entity178 and @entity16 are in discussions to work on a scouting project that aims to build a strong team for the next @entity14			1
as well as sport though @entity182 plans to eedicate his time to music and photography			0
" i 'm already doing a lot in art , in music , photography , tv documentaries and i have to focus on these to achieve what i 've reached with skiing , " said @entity16 , who has participated in television series and produced @entity188 , a tv documentary that according to @entity190 was released in @entity191 on may 2011			0
in the late 80 's , @entity16 took a break of his sporting career to venture in the music business			2
the @entity2 prince has recorded a couple of albums , with most of his songs are in @entity5			2
