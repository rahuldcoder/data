@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 , @entity4 , is back with a vengeance			1
a few hours after her memoirs of her relationship with president @entity15 , called " @entity11 pour ce moment " ( thanks for the moment ) hit the bookstands in @entity3 , a new poll showed that the president 's approval ratings were in free fall , reaching the historical low of 13 %			1
some extracts had been leaked to the press the day before and @entity21 , @entity4 's employer , had exclusively revealed the " best pages , " or rather the most damning pages about the president			1
on thursday evening , her publisher revealed that in just a few hours of sales , her essay was doing three times better than @entity29 when it was launched			0
on @entity31 , her book was selling like hot brioches , with one copy sold every five seconds			2
however , @entity3 political commentators , and for that matter the entire political class -- allies and foes alike -- dragged again to invade the privacy of the president , are clearly showing signs of farce fatigue and do n't relish his ex-girlfriend 's exercise in character assassination			1
they may have been amused back in january 2014 to learn of their president 's gallivanting in the streets of @entity0 , on a scooter driven by a bodyguard , en route to his belle , actress @entity55 , but today , they are not impressed			2
the truth is that nobody comes out unscathed			2
literature is perhaps the first casualty in this never - ending scandal , and on two levels			2
september is traditionally the literary season in @entity3 during which hundreds of new novels appear ( 600 this year ) and vie for some space in the media			2
no doubt @entity4 's book , by generating so much comment and covering so much space , will have ruined the prospect of many worthy first novels			1
secondly , " @entity11 pour ce moment " reads like a cheap romance and is an embarrassment for a former @entity21 literary critic			0
a few examples : " one day , a violent love blazed through my life like fire			0
" on their first kiss , in the middle of a cross-road in @entity88 : " it was indescribable , just like a scene out of a movie			0
" and the book 's epitaph : " i was not protected nor was i betrothed			0
i only hope i was loved as much as i loved			0
" @entity4 is no @entity91			2
on the revelation of the president 's affair , @entity4 keeps talking about " betrayal , " a word she also strangely uses to talk about @entity97 , the mother of the president 's four children whom @entity15 left for her			1
in fact , @entity4 was hoping for " a scenario à @entity102 " with @entity15 " apologizing in public and committing to never see @entity55 again			1
" except we are in @entity3 and a @entity3 president does n't apologize publicly for having had a fling			1
she was ready to forgive him , she says			0
when @entity15 decides on the contrary to break up , he suggests to her to write a joint communiqué , but she refuses ; he also asks her not to write a book about it all			1
what is very dubious about @entity4 's exercise is that she claims her life at the @entity115 was like being on a reporting assignment and that is how she says she wrote her book			2
only problem is , a reporter can not be the main actor of the events he or she is supposed to be describing			0
also , this is one version of events			0
we all know that a break - up has many sides ; and that truth is the most elusive of concepts in love			0
@entity4 herself comes out very badly : by dishing the dirt in public , she appears as she is , a scorned woman who ca n't get over it , full of revenge and full of herself			1
did she ever think of @entity3 when she wrote her book ? did she think of the country 's institutions ? could n't she have waited until her former lover left the @entity115 ? for a former first lady , she shows little sympathy for her compatriots and her country			1
the greatest casualty however in this affair , is president @entity15 and his image , which is now damaged beyond repair			1
in her 320 - page bitter attack , she presents him as a liar , cold and cynic			0
she also writes that he mocked her modest origins , calling people like her family " the toothless "			0
not quite what you might expect from a socialist president .			0

former @entity3 first lady publishes book about her relationship with @entity15
nobody comes out of the saga unscathed , writes commentator @entity168
@entity170 : @entity4 herself comes out very badly by dishing the dirt in public
greatest casualty is president @entity15 and his image , she adds
