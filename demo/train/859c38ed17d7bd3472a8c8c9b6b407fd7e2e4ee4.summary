-- for many months @entity2 's rebels have begged the international community to supply them with the weapons they say they need to overthrow president @entity5			1
now , their desperate pleas for help are one step closer to becoming reality after the @entity10 lifted its arms embargo on @entity2 rebels , clearing the way for @entity15 countries wishing to try to level the playing field in a horrific civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 people			1
but can @entity10 weapons turn the tide in the rebels ' favor in @entity2 , or is it already too late ? @entity0 examines the core questions behind the announcement			1
why has the embargo ended and what does it mean ? the weapons embargo on @entity2 rebels , along with a series of other @entity2 - related bans and sanctions , was scheduled to expire on saturday			1
but while the @entity10 's 27 member countries were able to reach the required consensus to extend all other bans , @entity37 and @entity38 refused to agree to an extension of the arms embargo			1
the lifting of the embargo comes with conditions -- @entity10 countries wishing to send weapons to @entity2 's rebels may only send them to the moderate @entity46 and the affiliated @entity47 , and they may only be used to protect civilians , according to a statement from the @entity10			1
@entity50 : @entity51 ' hit by rockets from @entity2 ' while the ban will technically be lifted on saturday , it is expected that the earliest @entity10 countries would send weapons to the rebels would be august , so as not to imperil the prospects of a @entity59 and @entity61 - brokered peace conference scheduled to take place in @entity63 in june			1
what countries would send weapons ? @entity37 and @entity38 led efforts to lift the embargo			1
both nations suggested joining countries such as @entity70 in providing weapons to rebels , arguing such a step would strengthen moderate rebels and make them less reliant on well - armed extremists in their ranks			2
" it was important for @entity15 to send a clear signal to the @entity5 regime that it has to negotiate seriously , and that all options remain on the table if it refuses to do so , " @entity37 foreign secretary @entity77 said in a statement			2
but the lengthy negotiations over the arms ban to rebels exposed the deep divisions in @entity10 countries ' foreign policies -- with @entity37 and @entity38 arguing forcefully to lift the embargo , while nations including @entity94 and @entity95 expressed fear that more weapons will only make the bloodbath in @entity2 worse			1
@entity99 : is @entity2 war escalating to wider conflict ? what kind of weapons would be sent ? @entity10 countries are free to send what they like to @entity2 's rebels , according to @entity0 's @entity108 -- provided the weapons go to the @entity47 and can be justified as protecting a civilian population			1
western countries could conceivably provide rebels with small arms and ammunition			0
but they 're unlikely to provide rebels with the arms they need most -- like portable shoulder - launched surface - to - air missiles ( @entity118 ) to counter @entity5 's domination of @entity2 air -- out of fear they 'll fall into the hands of radical @entity124 militant groups such as @entity125 , which the @entity59 says is affiliated with @entity126			1
without anti-aircraft missiles or heavier armor - piercing ammunition , experts say it 's unlikely that the rebels will be able to win the war			0
" so far it 's the @entity5 government 's ability to use air power against rebel held territory that 's really insured the insurgency ca n't make any significant gains , " said @entity133 , an analyst at @entity134 and @entity135			1
" unless they send really significant weapons like @entity118 , i find it hard to imagine that any other provision of weapons will turn the tide of the conflict			0
" when @entity2 rebels have obtained anti-aircraft and anti-tank guided missiles ( @entity153 ) in the past they 've been very effective , according to @entity133 , who says social media and militant group videos appeared to reveal an influx of @entity158 anti-tank weapons into rebel hands in southern @entity2 earlier this year via @entity160			1
" the @entity153 had a fairly significant impact on the conflict in the short term , in that they did allow rebels to take out tanks more effectively than they 'd been able to previously , " @entity133 told @entity0			0
" but these weapons very quickly went into the hands of militant @entity124 groups like @entity125			0
" opinion : @entity2 hostilities bring @entity173 catastrophe closer how to get the weapons into the country ? there are two main routes to get weapons to rebels in @entity2 , says @entity133 -- through the northern @entity181 border or through the southern @entity160 border			2
smuggling weapons via @entity181 is unlikely , however , because northern @entity2 's insurgency is dominated by the kind of radical militant groups the @entity187 is trying to avoid arming			2
@entity160 's strong ties to the @entity187 , its stability , and its links to the @entity47 make it the most likely place to smuggle weapons through , says @entity133			2
" in 2012 the @entity47 coordinated several high profile defections whereby the group 's militants transported senior government officials across the border into @entity160			0
there have also been unverified reports that a small core group of @entity47 members have been receiving military training in northern @entity160			0
all of that would tend to suggest that if weapons were to be sent through to militants , they would go by @entity160 , " he said			0
how can @entity10 countries prevent extremists from obtaining the weapons ? it is nearly impossible to prevent extremists from gaining possession of weapons once they 're smuggled into @entity2 , according to @entity216 , director of the @entity217 at the @entity218			2
" once you deliver weapons into a theater of operation , no one can have control or track who takes ownership of the weapons , " @entity216 said			0
" @entity37 and @entity38 are aware the weapons could fall into the wrong hands , but they 're willing to take a risk			2
" this risk has n't panned out before -- @entity133 says that the heavy @entity158 arms that allegedly flowed to rebel forces in @entity235 , southern @entity2 around the turn of the year quickly wound up in the hands of radical militants in northern cities battling alongside the moderates in @entity241			0
" the conflict is so interdependent -- in all local theaters across the country , @entity47 and other moderate groups regularly coordinate with groups like @entity125			0
it 's unrealistic to expect that a foreign state could provide weapons to one group and never expect the weapons to appear in other groups ' hands			0
" @entity216 says the greatest fear is that a radical group could use @entity10 weapons to attack civilian or @entity259 interests within @entity2 : " one major incident , for instance the targeting of a civilian aircraft , would change the whole conflict and have major ramifications			1
" interactive : war not only about @entity2 is the lifting of the @entity10 embargo a game changer for @entity2 ? without an influx of heavy weaponry , experts say the lifting of the embargo wo n't change the reality on the ground : @entity5 's regime is on the offensive , and the influx of @entity281 fighters from @entity51 means there is little the rebels can do to slow their progress at the moment			1
the real goal of the @entity10 announcement , @entity216 said , is to try to " maximize the chances of a diplomatic breakthrough " at the upcoming @entity63 peace talks -- if the talks go ahead			0
" the logic is to exert pressure on @entity5 and change his calculations			0
@entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity59 want it to be an instrument to exert pressure at the negotiating table and get @entity5 to be genuine and serious about political talks			2
but without direct @entity59 involvement in the conflict , neither @entity5 nor his allies will take the @entity10 decision very seriously			2
" the irony of the situation , @entity216 said , is that while the @entity59 president @entity307 wants @entity15 and / or @entity2 's neighbors to " take ownership " of the conflict , no country will do that without the @entity59 taking a leadership role on @entity2			0
" the announcement is not a game - changer , " @entity216 told @entity0			1
" i doubt very much whether it will make a difference in the raging struggle inside @entity2			0
" will the embargo 's lifting turn the conflict into a regional war ? those opposed to lifting the embargo say it could escalate the flow of weapons into @entity2 from all sides -- a fear that was realized hours after the announcement when @entity61 declared it would send sophisticated s - 300 surface - to - air missiles to the @entity2 government in accordance with a contract signed several years ago			1
" we believe that moves like this one to a great degree restrain some hotheads from escalating the conflict to the international scale , from involving external forces , " said foreign minister @entity334 , according to the state - run @entity336 news agency			0
between @entity61 arms shipments to the regime , @entity281 fighters pouring into the country to support government troops , and the lifting of the embargo on @entity2 rebels , @entity216 says the regional war is already here			1
" the conflict in @entity2 has gone too far ; it has mutated from an internal conflict to a regional war by proxy			1
so even if @entity37 and @entity38 decide to arm the opposition today , not in august , @entity61 and @entity359 will deepen their involvement in @entity2 and counterbalance any move by the @entity10 , " he told @entity0			1
" the @entity10 's announcement is a simplistic reading of a complex situation , because we 're beyond that with @entity5			2
this is a war to the bitter end			0
this is a zero - sum game			0
" @entity370 and @entity0 's @entity108 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 announces it has lifted arms embargo on @entity2 rebels
@entity37 , @entity38 can now send weapons to rebels fighting government of @entity5
@entity380 : announcement is not a game - changer , wo n't make difference on the ground
@entity380 : @entity2 conflict has mutated into a regional war between @entity187 , @entity61 , @entity359
