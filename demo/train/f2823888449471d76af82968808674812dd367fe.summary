-- having lived and breathed @entity2 for the last two and a half years , i finally stepped aboard her for the final leg to @entity5			1
my first day was thankfully uneventful ; some steering , a game of @entity8 , plenty of dozing and just a little hide and seek with some nausea			1
but at sea it is the night that ushers in the sublime ; a sky ablaze with burning bright stars , twenty or more tumbling gracefully into oblivion			1
a small slither of a smiley moon , barely concealing the bright promise that lies beneath			1
a huge billowing turret of a cloud , host to a lightning show so brilliant that it casts momentary shadows across deck			2
what is ridiculous is that any of this ever happened at all			2
this boat ; conceived , designed and built out of plastic bottles , which has sailed over 4000 miles to be here today beneath this unbelievable sky			1
" it 's a boat , made from plastic bottles , " @entity32 said to me in december 2007			1
" we 've got this amazing sustainability architect , @entity38 , on board			2
he 's done some dope drawings and we 're interviewing for a naval engineer			2
the plan is to sail through this thing called the @entity45 patch , doing science along the way and inspiring people to look at @entity49 as a resource			2
we 'll build it in @entity52 , set sail in december ( 2008 ) and arrive into @entity54 march 09			2
" i 'm paraphrasing massively , but you get the gist			2
" @entity59 , " was what i remember thinking			2
i was working for a firm building emergency bridges in @entity61 and was ready for something different			2
this seemed different and i was in			0
the early days of the project revolved around meetings , phone calls and a staggering inbox of emails			1
we were rich in big ideas and exceptional consultants but poor in concrete ideas and real boating knowledge			0
the brief was very strict and has always remained so ; the bottles must be the primary element of the boat ideally performing both structure and flotation			1
we were to use no glues , minimal fixings , minimal new components or materials			0
in addition it was to sustainably support a crew of six using innovative " off grid " life support systems			1
it was a hugely creative period with amazing sausage - type bottle structures and invertebrate raft ideas all on the table			0
the wackier most bottle - centric minimal structure designs were favored			0
we had a major coup early on which was the " gassing " of the bottles			1
of great concern was stabilizing the bottles into mini structures themselves			1
the obvious solution seemed to be pressurizing them , but how ? we variously talked about fitting bicycle valves to the caps and pumping them up , building a hyperbaric chamber to fill the bottles under pressure and finally liquid nitrogen			1
knowing very little about liquid nitrogen i set off happily to @entity112 intent on gettin ' me some			0
the guy looked at me like i was crazy , which was something i was to get used to over the next few years			1
" er , i do n't think so , " he said			0
not such a good idea			0
" dry ice on the other hand , " he said grinning sheepishly , " would be an excellent alternative			0
" and before i knew it he was shoveling crystalline , smoky powder into an @entity125 bottle			0
" watch this , " he said , screwing on the cap and ejecting it into the empty parking lot			0
it was a saturday morning deep in the bowels of @entity132 in @entity133 , but the bang when the bottle spectacularly exploded i thought was sure to bring @entity136 troops parachuting down on us			0
not wishing to stick around to find out i bought all the dry ice he had and made my exit			0
i could hear a faint call after me : " make sure you keep a window open in the car ... " " @entity148 , " i thought as i careered out of there , windows down in the freezing february air			1
i was in search of somewhere quiet and secluded to do some experimenting of my own			0
so despite this early success with the bottles we were still a very " un-boaty " collection of boat designers			1
we were in for a rude awakening ...			0
@entity156 , of @entity157 based in @entity54 came highly recommended and joined us in @entity133 in early march 2008			1
he came complete with a first draft design -- of a boat			1
" it 's a bit boat - like , " we conferred out of earshot			1
" too much structure , " was another comment			0
" but a good starting point nevertheless , " someone else chimed in			0
what @entity156 knew and we did n't was that boats typically look like boats and require structure			0
so began the taming of the shrew .			0

@entity2 *expedition* *co-ordinator* @entity174 recalls early days of the project
joined the @entity2 as a crew member in @entity178 on june 14 heading for @entity5
finding ways to make a boat from plastic bottles took years of trial and error
