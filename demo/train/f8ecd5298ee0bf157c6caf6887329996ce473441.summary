@entity0 -- @entity4 president @entity10 's " @entity9 " speech delivered 50 years ago was well received by more than 100,000 @entity2 hopeful for @entity4 's steadfast support as @entity0 came to symbolize one of the @entity7 's main battlegrounds			1
as presidential candidate in the summer of 2008 , @entity11 had nearly twice that number of optimistic onlookers at @entity0 's @entity15 who eagerly anticipated a new @entity4 outlook on questions ranging from climate change to nuclear disarmament			0
the state visit to @entity2 this week , with a public appearance in front of the @entity24 , will most probably offer transatlantic reassurances and deliverables from the @entity4 as echoed by both @entity28 and @entity29 presidents in the past ; but instead , the current @entity4 president should take this as an opportunity to bring @entity2 out of its shell and persuade it to act as a legitimate power in world affairs			1
although looked on as a traditional ally of the @entity4 along with the @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity2 has often taken a backseat within the trio since it struggles to find a comfort zone in the realm of hard security			1
reminders of @entity47 's devastation -- and @entity2 's role in that -- have shaped the @entity51 's largest country to showcase its economic prowess rather than its military capabilities			0
according to the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , the @entity38 spends nearly double on military expenditure as a percentage of @entity58 in comparison to @entity2 , and @entity39 is not far behind @entity38			0
yet today the cards are reshuffled , the economic crisis has left the @entity38 and @entity39 weak and inward looking while @entity2 for the most part weathered the storm			1
@entity2 's new standing in @entity65 and the world has garnered it respect and scorn , something that comes with the territory for a great power			1
president @entity11 recognizes @entity2 as a leading global player , and has mentioned the country in his last two @entity75 speeches			1
the @entity4 has cultivated its relationship with chancellor @entity77 : she was honored with a state dinner at the @entity79 in 2011 and two years before that she was the first @entity2 chancellor in more than 50 years to address the @entity80			2
five decades ago , @entity2 was a trusted partner and a protectorate of the @entity4 ; today it is @entity83 that needs @entity2 's support in taking transatlantic relations to the next level			2
with the @entity38 dangling threats to opt out of the @entity51 and @entity39 struggling to jump start its economy ; the @entity4 should encourage @entity2 to reignite the @entity65 project in order to show the world that @entity65 can be an essential partner when it comes to confronting challenges around the world			2
opinion : @entity97 : no need for @entity38 ' threat ' to leave @entity51 three areas calling for @entity2 leadership are the euro crisis , transatlantic trade and multilateral security			1
within @entity65 , @entity2 does n't have to solely spread the mantra of austerity , it could also share its lessons learned in economic reform and commitment to vocational education -- not too long ago it was labeled the @entity112 while today unemployment is below 7 %			0
on behalf of @entity65 , @entity2 should spearhead the current @entity114 ( @entity114 ) between the @entity4 and @entity65 that is on the negotiating table			0
@entity114 will enhance the prosperity gains on both sides of the @entity118 and set the ground rules for trade as a check to @entity122			0
finally the @entity4 needs @entity123 - member @entity2 to play a stronger military role at hot spots around the world			1
the misdeeds of @entity2 's past should never be forgotten , and @entity2 decision - makers are sensitive to historical responsibility , all the more reason to support their allies when ushering change in despotic countries -- @entity135 was one such case			2
parallels between two young presidents representing a vision of @entity4 a half a century apart will certainly be drawn during @entity11 's state visit to @entity2			1
there might even be a line for the history books after the speech at the @entity24 , but @entity11 knows there is no pressure			0
@entity2 's expectations for @entity4 have dampened since his last visit and @entity0 today shows scant scars of 1963			0
it is the @entity4 that hopes @entity2 will step up and take the leadership mantle in @entity65 and elsewhere			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			0

@entity11 makes a state visit to @entity2 this week
he should persuade @entity2 to take the lead in world affairs , writes @entity154 - @entity154
@entity2 leadership is required for the euro crisis , transatlantic trade and multilateral security
