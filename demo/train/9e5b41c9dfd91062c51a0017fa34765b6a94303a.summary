-- in what has become a dire and politically explosive situation at the border that includes droves of unaccompanied young border - crossers , overcrowded holding facilities , angry protesters and finger - pointing politicians , @entity1 struggles to get the situation under control			2
politicians , however , easily point fingers of blame			0
on sunday , politicians from both sides of the political aisle said president @entity18 is not doing enough to stem the influx of immigrants -- some young children -- from coming to the @entity22			1
@entity18 to blame rep. @entity23 , @entity24 , who represents the district where the immigrants are crossing the @entity27 at the southernmost tip of the @entity29 , said the @entity18 administration is " one step behind			1
" " they should have seen this a long time ago , because we saw those numbers increasing , " he said on @entity0 's " @entity32 , " referring to the rise of undocumented immigrants across the border in recent years			0
@entity23 said that in 2009 , about 6,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border , which jumped to 25,000 in 2013			1
( the @entity40 estimated 39,000 children crossed last year			0
) but just in may , @entity23 said the number exploded to 9,700 unaccompanied children who unlawfully crossed the border			1
opinion : the ' i - word ' is un-american up to 80,000 children are expected this year , most coming from @entity47			2
" they knew this was happening a year ago , last year			0
and ... they 're not reacting fast enough at this time , in my personal opinion , " @entity23 said			1
@entity23 has been putting pressure on the administration to more aggressively address the issue , but his blunt remarks on national television sunday reveals the level of frustration he has as his district is the entry point for many			1
he says the drug cartels are in part to blame and at an average of $ 5,000 per person are making hundreds of millions of dollars shuttling mothers with children and unaccompanied children into the @entity22			0
like those children , i too fled @entity47 @entity70 @entity69 gov. @entity69 also blasted the president for what he calls his lack of engagement			1
@entity69 said he sent the administration a letter in 2012 outlining the rise of unaccompanied children crossing into @entity70			1
he even went so far , again , to say that @entity18 might be culpable			2
" you are either inept or you have some ulterior motive of which you are functioning from			1
" @entity69 's remark did n't go quite as far as a statement he made on @entity83 in june when he said , " i hate to be conspiratorial , " before he floated a conspiracy theory , " but i mean how do you move that many people from @entity47 across @entity88 and then into the @entity22 without there being a fairly coordinated effort ? " @entity69 's tone , however , was a change from just last week when he testified at a congressionally led hearing in @entity94 , @entity70 , near the @entity88 border			1
" i 'm tired of pointing fingers and blaming people , " he said at the hearing			0
" i hope what we can do is come up with some solutions here			0
" @entity69 , who is contemplating another run at the @entity103 presidential nomination , on sunday said @entity18 has caused the situation			1
" it is a failure of diplomacy			0
it is a failure of leadership , " he said			0
but sen. @entity109 , @entity110 , defended the president , saying he " understands what needs to be done			2
" he said @entity103 need to look in the mirror when they issue blame			0
" they had the opportunity for one solid year to call the @entity116			0
and yet they refused to , " he said on @entity119 ' " @entity118			0
" sen. @entity120 , @entity121 , a main proponent of the comprehensive immigration reform that passed the @entity123 but has been stalled in the @entity103 - led @entity124 , said the situation " breaks my heart " because it hurts any chance there was of completing work on the bill any time soon			2
what can be done the administration says it is working " within the confines of the law " to address the crisis , homeland security secretary @entity132 said			1
" there are a number of things that the president and i , within the confines of the law , can do to fix the broken immigration system , and we will , " he said on @entity144 's " @entity143			1
" he said the administration 's actions include speeding up deportation for the adult immigrants			2
opinion : @entity103 left @entity18 no choice but to act on immigration but sen. @entity152 , @entity154 - @entity153 , also a proponent of immigration reform , said the children must be sent back			1
" if you do n't , you 're going to incentivize people throughout that part of the world to keep sending their children here , " he said on " @entity118			0
" the administration 's options are somewhat limited			2
a 2008 human trafficking law says children immigrants from @entity47 can not be immediately returned to their country of origin and must be cared for humanely			2
the children are transferred to the @entity170 , which is responsible for finding relatives in the @entity22 with whom the children can stay			0
the youths are given immigration court dates but most do n't appear , adding to the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the @entity22			0
@entity23 said the law " needs to be changed at this time			1
" @entity18 has asked @entity179 to change the law but @entity179 ' path forward is unclear			1
@entity69 , however , refused to indicate a law signed by @entity103 president @entity183 was part of the problem			1
he focused his demands on border security , which is the standard @entity103 talking point on immigration reform			0
he said he 's only worried about one law : " the @entity190 requires the @entity22 to secure the border			0
and we 're not doing that			0
" in response to @entity195 and @entity196 , @entity197 , saying he " is confident " the border patrol has the resources after the deployment of more than 250 additional agents recently , @entity69 said maintained his insistence that lax border security is the problem			2
he is " absolutely and totally wrong , " @entity69 said , noting that @entity70 has seven agents per mile compared with 15 per mile along other parts of the border			1
showdown over immigration : " this is an invasion ' @entity0 's @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
