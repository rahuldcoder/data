@entity0 -- when @entity3 was admitted to hospital , @entity2 took a deep breath and prepared themselves for the worst			1
despite the government issuing statements telling concerned citizens not to panic , they did			0
@entity3 holds such a special place in @entity2 's hearts that they fortify themselves with the inevitable day when he takes his last breath			1
at 93 , many here are grateful the former president and @entity19 winner is still with them			0
he has long left the public and political stage but the knowledge that he is still around -- enjoying retirement on a farm in the @entity26 -- gives them a sense of comfort			1
@entity3 is held in deep affection because he reminds @entity2 of how far they have come			1
@entity3 rekindles @entity2 nostalgia for a time when this country was a miracle of democracy			1
@entity3 is the embodiment of the @entity2 that was promised in the election of 1994			1
the reality is that many @entity2 worry that their " rainbow nation " no longer embodies @entity3 's vision			1
with @entity3 old and silent , there have been many worrying signs that his country has deviated off @entity3 's path of reconciliation and democracy , say observers			2
the government , under president @entity48 , finds it challenging to embrace @entity3 's dedication to a critical and probing free press			2
a new law , called the @entity57 , could jail journalists and whistleblowers for up to 25 years if they are caught in possession of classified state information			0
the government has refused to add a " public interest " clause , which would limit the scope of this legislation			0
the government says this law aims to protect the country from foreign enemies			2
however , civil society groups say it is an attempt to muzzle the press , which has been vigorous in reporting corruption within government			0
corruption has for many , become the cancer at the heart of modern - day @entity2			1
it seems not a day goes by without a civil servant being outed for dodgy dealings			0
the former police chief is in prison for accepting bribes from a crime boss , the wife of the minister of state security has been found guilty of drug trafficking and @entity86 , president @entity48 's former financial adviser , who was jailed for fraud and corruption , barely served his sentence and is on " medical parole " despite being seen playing golf by journalists			0
the province of @entity95 was recently declared " technically bankrupt " by the national treasury after discovering there was " unauthorized and irregular " spending by the provincial leadership			0
observers say the looting of state coffers is not just limited to the @entity95 province			0
additionally , the cornerstone of @entity3 's legacy -- the constitution -- has always been a soothing balm to even the most pessimistic about @entity2 's prospects			1
no matter the challenges that convulse society , there was always the sense that the work of the judiciary and the @entity115 would protect the democratic edifice			0
when president @entity48 recently said in a newspaper interview that he was looking to " review " the work of the @entity115 there was a deep sense of dismay			0
many people have been left wondering why @entity125 - led government would tinker with the foundations of @entity3 's @entity2			1
@entity3 is said by those close to him to be suffering from a form of senile dementia , which doctors say is common in the very old			2
he gets confused and is easily upset and agitated			0
importantly , for a man who was obsessed with the news , his family and the military now largely protect him from the details of everyday life			0
if he really understood what was going on around him , what would @entity3 say about an apartheid - era law that was being used to threaten journalists trying to report on his health ? ironically , the government is using the @entity143 -- previously known as the feared @entity144 -- to increase the powers of the security structures to declare , in secret , buildings that are of " national importance			1
" this law was created in 1980 at the height of the state of emergency and policed by apartheid forces			2
when reporters stood on the perimeter of the military hospital believed to be where @entity3 was being treated , they were threatened with arrest if they filmed the hospital building			2
one photographer was detained briefly and has since been released			0
the same law has been evoked in a case against two news agencies , which apparently set up cameras outside @entity3 's @entity26 home			1
legal experts hope that case goes to court because they say this " key points " legislation would never pass a constitutional test			0
despite many contradictions , @entity2 remains a beautiful and extraordinary nation			2
present day @entity2 is so much better than those dark , ugly days when @entity3 was in jail and the racist laws subjugated most citizens			1
however , the reason @entity2 panic when they hear @entity3 is unwell is because they think to their future			1
they worry that when the day finally comes that @entity3 goes , the country loses its democratic anchor .			2

ailing @entity3 holds special place in @entity2 ' hearts
@entity3 has long left political stage but he embodies nation promised in 1994
@entity2 worry their " rainbow nation " no longer matches his vision
corruption is *widespread* ; apartheid - era law being used to protect his *privacy*
