flooding the airwaves this election year in battleground states across the country are @entity5 ads featuring two men not on any ballot , and not even politicians			2
they 're the @entity10 brothers , billionaire businessmen and @entity13 mega donors			1
senate majority leader @entity14 takes the unusual step of regularly ripping @entity16 and @entity10 from the @entity18 floor			1
he says they have " no conscience , " calling them " un-american			2
" and now , is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban the kind of anonymous political giving the @entity24 engage in and , some experts say , perfected			1
other high - profile democrats are hitting the @entity24 , too -- from vice president @entity27 to former vice president @entity28 , who this week argued @entity13 are reluctant to publicly accept the existence of man - made global warming for fear of crossing the @entity10 brothers			1
" i do n't think it 's particularly complicated			2
they will face primary opponents financed by the @entity10 brothers and others who are part of their group , " @entity28 said			1
@entity5 sources tell @entity41 it 's a carefully crafted strategy to make the @entity10 brothers the 2014 election villains -- the personification of the rich manipulating the political system -- bankrolling a @entity13 agenda to get richer			1
" the @entity10 brothers seem to believe in an @entity51 where the system is rigged to benefit the very wealthy , " @entity14 says as part of his regular @entity50 rant			1
democrats are also trying to goad @entity13 into publicly defending them as a way to attack @entity13 candidate as being in the @entity24 ' pockets			2
@entity18 showdown likely coming over campaign spending it begs the question : how wealthy are they ? @entity60 puts @entity16 and @entity10 as the fourth - richest men in the @entity51 , with a fortune of more than $ 41 billion			1
an oil , gas and textile conglomerate their oil , gas and textile conglomerate , @entity66 , makes products people use every day : @entity71 , toilet paper , stainmaster products and even @entity74			2
their business is privately held			0
the brothers own 84 % of @entity66 shares			2
their libertarian politics come from their father , @entity80 , a chemical engineer whose experience working in the @entity82 instilled an aversion to big government			2
@entity16 and @entity10 spend tens of millions of their personal wealth to push those anti-big government views			1
but exactly how much they donate is impossible to track because it is cloaked in secrecy			2
they fund groups that are not required to disclose donors -- groups that work to determine the outcome of federal , state and even municipal elections			1
" they are very secretive in the way they operate politically , " explained @entity97 of the @entity98 , which tracks political spending			0
" they have a very vast and wide network of non-profit and limited liability companies , " he said			0
it 's a huge web of roughly three dozen conservative groups funded , at least in part , by the @entity24			0
one group , @entity110 , acts as a hub of sorts			0
it is funded by the @entity24 and 200 other like - minded businessmen			0
if that sounds confusing , that 's probably the point			0
their @entity118 filing from 2012 shows @entity110 raised more than $ 250 million that election year			0
one of the most prominent @entity10 - backed groups is @entity121 , which the brothers helped found			1
@entity10 is still on the board , and one of his few public speeches each year at @entity121 's annual meeting			1
@entity121 puts its money where its mouth is could spend $ 125 million this cycle an @entity121 official told @entity41 that it 's on course to spend more than $ 125 million this midterm election year , which would be unprecedented , and likely more than the party apparatus will spend			2
and like the political parties , that money will go toward television ads , ground operations and voter data collection			0
but unlike the political parties , @entity121 's money comes from anonymous donations			1
" we 're going to shield the privacy and the first amendment rights of the folks who support us , " @entity121 president @entity145 said			0
@entity145 says he is proud to have the @entity24 ' support , but also says they have 90,000 donors from all 50 states as well			0
" they 're interested in the policies we 're pursuing			0
they 're interested in , are we going to have cheap , affordable , reliable energy , " @entity145 said			0
they 're interested in are we going to stop tax increases from going thru the roof and hurting @entity51 , including businesses			0
" @entity5 say the idea that money is going to opposing government regulation and environmental protections because of economic principle is laughable			2
they say it 's really all about making the @entity24 and like - minded businessmen richer			0
to counter that , @entity10 allies argue that ethanol subsidies help @entity10 industries , but @entity121 and other groups the @entity10 's fund , lobby against the government assistance			1
@entity41 sought an interview with @entity16 or @entity10 , but the media - averse brothers declined			1
a spokesman , instead , offered @entity181 , their longtime friend and former employee			0
" i would describe them as people who are driven by integrity , humility , " @entity181 said			0
the image of the @entity10 brothers as two fat cats with puppet strings controlling @entity13 is " just not reality , " she said			1
infusing @entity51 with libertarian ideals those who know @entity16 and @entity10 say they have a long - term goal of infusing @entity51 with their libertarian ideals			1
but each has a personal passion			0
for @entity202 , a soft - spoken intellectual who lives in the brothers ' hometown of @entity205 , @entity206 , it 's higher education			2
he has pumped millions into colleges and universities around the country , mostly to push free market economics with college students			2
he even founded the @entity213 back in 1974 , a think tank dedicated to studying and advancing libertarian ideals			0
by contrast , @entity10 lives in @entity217 like a traditional big city billionaire			1
his passion outside of political advocacy is donating tens of millions to medical research , hospitals , and even the arts -- a liberal bastion			1
he gave $ 35 million to bring a dinosaur exhibit to the @entity226 , and even restored the ballet at @entity228 -- which bears his name			0
their name might be on buildings and on @entity5 lips , but they remain largely silent			0
earlier this year , shortly after @entity14 launched his anti-koch campaign , @entity202 took the rare step of penning an op - ed in the @entity238			1
" instead of encouraging free and open debate , collectivists strive to discredit and intimidate opponents			0
they engage in character assassination			0
( i should know , as the almost daily target of their attacks ) , " he wrote			0
" such tactics are the antithesis of what is required for a free society -- and a telltale sign that the collectivists do not have good answers , " wrote @entity10			1
so , why do n't they speak out more ; do interviews to explain and defend themselves ? " i think that instinct is somewhat mediated by the , just the nastiness and the viciousness of these attacks that have real ramifications from the standpoint of security , " @entity181 said			0
she and other @entity10 sources wo n't be specific , but insist they 've had significant death threats against them personally , and threats against their businesses			1
but the reality is that @entity16 and @entity10 do n't just cling to privacy because of security concerns			1
they 're trying to limit public scrutiny -- even as @entity5 make them the faces of fat cat influence .			1
