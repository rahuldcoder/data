-- in november 2009 , @entity2 freelance journalist @entity1 is riding in a pick - up truck on a dusty track of @entity6 road			1
the @entity7 have kidnapped him			1
if the truck turns right , he knows he 's being sold to another militant group			1
a left turn means his kidnappers have decided to let him go			1
his journey started when @entity13 , who wanted to document the daily lives of the @entity7 , accepted the invitation of a @entity7 commander to film him and his fighters			1
@entity1 later accompanied another @entity7 commander , @entity19 , to his hideout on a second embed			1
as part of @entity0 's " @entity7 " documentary , @entity1 talked with @entity0 's @entity24 about going from invited guest to kidnap victim -- a harrowing experience that began the way it later ended , with @entity1 in a truck			1
here is an edited excerpt : @entity32 : we rent a pickup truck and we drive into this valley that does n't really have a road			1
i 'm told it is not possible to drive anymore			1
we will have to walk for several hours up the hillside to one village , and we have to sneak a little bit			1
@entity19 is very particular about i should cover my face			1
i assume this is because they do n't want informers to see that there 's a foreigner coming			1
and we sleep in a house , and everything seems ok			1
then , the next day we are asked to go to another house , just 100 meters down the hillside			1
we have to wait there , because they 're going to have a meeting			1
after a couple hours , one of the fighters comes and says he 's from @entity57			1
and he says that he has information that i was spying for the coalition , so both my translator and i will be executed tonight			1
and he goes on , saying that we 're going to be killed with a knife			1
... he explains how much he hates foreigners and he wants to eat the flesh of foreigners			1
in the first moment , you are shocked			1
but then , i kind of go on autopilot			1
i know what to say			1
i have some pre-prepared arguments			1
you know , describing why i can not be a spy			1
why i 'm not responsible for what my government does			1
and then he starts talking about money			1
and i am so happy			2
i mean , i do n't smile , but i am so relieved			2
@entity78 : once he starts talking about money , you 're happy ? @entity32 : yes			2
because then i know this is just business ; that all of the talk about eating flesh and beheading is just nonsense			2
... he says he wants $ 500,000			2
and i say that 's not possible			2
i want to bring the sum down			2
to make them understand there 's not going to be a lot of dollars			2
so , i talk with my translator and we come up with a counteroffer of $ 20,000			2
@entity78 : why $ 20,000 ? @entity32 : because that 's possible			2
i mean , $ 20,000 i could get quite easily			2
@entity97 : you 're negotiating ? @entity32 : yes			2
@entity97 : for your life ? @entity32 : yeah			1
but , you know , that 's @entity6			2
you never pay the asking price , so to say			2
so , we 're making a counteroffer of $ 20,000			2
and they come back with other options , other alternatives for granting my freedom : a prisoner exchange , or ransom , or i convert to @entity113			2
but , if none of these three , then it 's beheading			2
so , i send the kidnappers the message that yes , in that situation , i could convert to @entity113			2
i convert to @entity113 on the second day of the kidnapping			0
but @entity19 , he does n't keep his			0
and the day after , we are back to the $ 20,000 and how can we get the money here			0
because the kidnappers are amateurs , they give me the phone to call around to get the money			0
i mean , this is @entity6 and things there are quite absurd sometimes			0
i 'm negotiating with the kidnappers , and i 'm making my own ransom phone calls			0
i call @entity132 , and i call the @entity2 embassy			0
with @entity132 , i speak in @entity134 , a language the kidnappers do not understand			0
talking with my embassy , i speak in @entity2 , and you know , i can start giving information , where i 'm kept , how many people are in the house , et cetera , et cetera , under the pretext of arranging for the money			0
so , we 're waiting			0
and then , suddenly , there 's a new development			0
the man from @entity57 speaks with my translator			0
and my translator explains that @entity19 has an offer from another group			0
the other group wants to buy me for $ 50,000 , and that 's bad news			0
@entity78 : that 's really bad news , because groups do trade hostages			0
... do you start to get really scared ? @entity32 : yes			0
i understand things are starting to get out of control			0
if this other group pays @entity19 $ 50,000 for me , what ransom do you think they will demand ? i mean , it will be at least $ 250,000 , probably half a million or even more			0
this is not a good position			0
between the fifth and the sixth day -- @entity19 is receiving phone calls , as far as i know , from his spiritual leader in @entity169 , from the @entity7 spokesman , and also apparently from the commander of the @entity169 @entity7			1
and all of them are saying that he should release his hostage			0
so , @entity19 is under pressure from the @entity7 to release me			1
@entity78 : why ? @entity32 : for the main leadership , let 's say , of the @entity7 , it is embarrassing for them that a hostage converting to @entity113 is still being held			1
on the sixth day , the fighter from @entity57 comes and he says , " today , you 're gon na be released			0
" of course , we do n't believe him , because he 's been lying all during the whole situation			0
later , two other fighters arrive			0
and one of them is carrying my video camera			0
they want to make an interview			0
they ask me , " have you been beaten by the @entity7 , by the fighters ? " and i say no. " are you gon na inform the @entity192 about our positions ? " and i say , " of course not			1
" and that 's it			0
then we are told we are leaving			0
so we walk south out of the valley for five hours			0
the night comes and we reach a dirt road			0
there is a pick up truck there with three men i 'd never seen before			0
and we are just left with these three men			0
so we do n't really know , are we sold or are we free ? we get in the pickup truck and we start going down a dirt track			0
when we get down to a paved road , if we turn to the right , we will be heading to the @entity209 , which means @entity19 has sold us to another group			1
but , if we turn left , we will be heading for the town , and we are free			1
so , that 's kind of nerve - wracking going down there			0
and then , we take the left			0
@entity78 : and so , you knew you were going to be free ? @entity32 : yeah			0
@entity97 : that must have been the greatest left turn of your life			1
