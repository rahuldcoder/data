@entity0 -- if one hardened cockpit door is good , would two barriers be even better ? many airline pilots believe the answer is " yes , " and are hoping to reinvigorate efforts to require so - called " secondary barriers " on every commercial plane in the country			1
pilots praise the hardened cockpit doors mandated after 9/11 , saying they have done as much as anything to protect aircraft from terrorist assaults			1
but planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory , get meals or , on long flights , change out crews			2
currently , flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit			2
but pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability			1
" this is an absolute no - brainer , " capt. @entity35 of the @entity36 said			0
" of all the things we could do , the most cost - effective thing we could do right now is put the device in			0
" @entity36 this summer published a position paper calling on the @entity44 and @entity45 governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by january 1 , 2010			2
the barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds , giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit , @entity36 said			2
hijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year , according to @entity36			0
the airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers , saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security			1
the barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots do n't ordinarily leave the cockpit , and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights			1
" you can never guarantee that you 're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit			0
you can never guarantee that you 're going to have a federal air marshal , or federal air marshal team , in the cabin to defend that cockpit			0
" but the secondary barrier , once installed , will always be there , " @entity35 said			0
the government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots , but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the @entity44 in a june 2005 report to @entity91 , the @entity89 said the barrier " appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost			2
" " valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck , " the report said			0
but the @entity89 recommended against mandating secondary barriers , citing " the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [ airlines ] to retrofit " aircraft			1
" the economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs , including persistently rising fuel prices , makes this a decisive recommendation			0
" the @entity112 , which represents the nation 's major airlines , said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done " in the absence of appropriate risk analysis			1
" rep. @entity121 , @entity123 - @entity122 , said he is again introducing a bill to require barriers on passenger planes			1
" everybody recognizes the vulnerability , " he said			0
" the airline industry recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the federal government ought to pay for the secondary barriers			1
the federal government recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the airline industry should pay			1
" meanwhile , for as long as the debate continues , the flying public is less safe			0
