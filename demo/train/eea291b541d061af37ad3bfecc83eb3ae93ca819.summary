-- slumping @entity2 @entity1 and defending champion @entity3 will not be contesting the weekend action at the @entity6 's flagship event at @entity7			1
with organizers still reeling from the controversy surrounding @entity12 's " fried chicken " jibe , the star attractions comfortably failed to make the halfway cut friday at the @entity15			1
@entity1 2013 travails continued as he followed a first round 74 with a 75 to finish on five - over 149 -- three outside the qualification mark			1
@entity1 's @entity20 colleague @entity19 , who is leading the @entity21 to @entity22 , finished on the same mark , while @entity3 , who went to @entity24 in the rankings last season with his second straight title at the tournament , was a further shot adrift			1
@entity3 , who was on antibiotics , may have had an excuse in the freezing wet conditions on the @entity33 , and battled to a level - par 72 in his second round after a sorry 78 on the first day			2
but @entity1 , who came into the $ 6 million event saying he was pleased with his game , could offer little in the way of explanation for his poor showing			1
" i did n't play particularly well today , " he told @entity40			0
" i 'm looking forward to getting back to some golf without four layers			0
sometimes when the weather is bad i try to do too much with the ball and hit some bad shots			2
" standing four - over on the par - five17th , the @entity47 @entity15 champion needed a birdie or better to get stand a chance of making the final two rounds			2
a wayward tee shot into the trees led to a double bogey seven and his chances were over			0
@entity12 fared better and remained in contention after a battling 71 for one - under 143 , but trails halfway leader @entity56 of @entity57 by five shots			1
@entity56 's superb four - under 68 in testing conditions has left the @entity57 @entity60 star one shot clear of @entity63 's @entity62 , @entity65 's @entity64 , @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity69 @entity68			1
@entity70 - based @entity56 said he had adapted to the inclement @entity72 weather			2
" six under is a good score given the conditions - i live over here now so i am used to it - and i 'm in a great position going into the weekend , " he told the official @entity6 website			0
" but it 's a really tough course so anyone six or seven behind is still in it			0
" other star attractions @entity82 and @entity72 open champion @entity84 were firmly in the picture on three under , the former showing his improved short game around the green on his way to a battling 71			0
the crowds were also delighted as the oldest man in the event , the ever popular @entity90 , made three birdies in the last four holes to finish on one - over 145			0
@entity97 @entity60 captains past and present , @entity98 , @entity100 - @entity99 and @entity101 , who takes charge of the team at @entity104 next year , also survived for the weekend when the weather forecast is more favorable .			0
