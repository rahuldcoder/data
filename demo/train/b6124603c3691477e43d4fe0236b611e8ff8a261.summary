@entity0 , @entity1 -- heavy users of betel quids reveal their addiction when they smile			1
their teeth are stained a reddish - black , dyed from years of chewing potent parcels of areca nuts and tobacco , wrapped in a lime - coated betel leaf			1
" some people after they eat they 're drinking coffee or tea ; always after eating i 'm chewing the betel nut			1
i like it , " says @entity16 , a 28 - year - old noodle seller at a market in @entity1 's largest city , @entity0			2
like tea or coffee , betel quids -- or " nuts " as they 're often referred to -- give users a lift			1
but unlike tea or coffee , they also give them oral cancer			1
" having one is okay , but the danger increases when you start having the second one			0
when you reach a certain point , people will get cancer , " said professor @entity34 , vice president of @entity35 in @entity36 who conducted some of the first studies into the link between betel quids and oral cancer in the 1990s			1
a betel quid is the name given to small parcels that typically contain areca nuts , wrapped in a betel leaf coated with slaked lime			1
spices may be added for taste in different parts of @entity57 , including cardamom , saffron cloves and sweeteners , according to research compiled by the @entity62 in its monograph " @entity64 - quid and @entity65 " ( 2004 )			1
around 600 million people worldwide are thought to chew betel quids , making them the fourth most commonly used psychoactive substance after tobacco , alcohol and caffeinated drinks			1
they 're predominantly chewed in @entity57 , where their use is n't limited to adults			2
you can see it in the research , and on the teeth of some children			2
in @entity1 , quids are popular with drivers who use them to stay alert on the road			1
@entity84 , 37 , chews around 10 quids a day			2
he 's a taxi driver , and is stocking up at one of the many roadside stands in central @entity0			0
" the tobacco is just like a drug , " he said			0
" so when i 'm chewing the betel nut i get a bit dizzy			2
" he says he does n't smoke cigarettes			0
@entity92 , he says , are " better for me , " though it 's unclear whether he 's referring to his health or the cheap cost of the addictive little parcels			0
a pack of three costs 100 @entity1 kyat , around 10 @entity100 cents			2
at least , that 's how much seller @entity102 , 26 , charges at his stall in central @entity0			0
he 's quickly wrapping new parcels while @entity84 waits			0
@entity102 ca n't say how many parcels he makes a day , but in a couple of minutes he 's made six			0
he swiftly coats the leaves with lime before arranging them in rows and adding areca nuts and a sprinkle of tobacco			1
he flicks some more lime on before bagging them , and adds another sprinkle of tobacco for good measure			2
@entity84 smiles as he hands over his cash , his teeth flecked that familiar shade of red			0
the chewing of areca nuts dates back centuries , as far as the bronze age , according to a study of remains excavated at @entity130 , @entity131 province in @entity132 , published in 2001			1
researchers found the teeth appeared to be stained by betel quids			1
the practice has been around so long it 's become an important part of cultural and religious rituals , and in some parts of @entity57 the parcels are used as a herbal remedy for anything from toothache to acne			2
some also believe they have aphrodisiac properties			0
scientific research has found that chewing betel quids leads to an increased risk of cancer -- whether or not tobacco is included			1
carcinogens derived from tobacco and the areca nut were found in the saliva of people chewing the parcels , though it was n't clear whether they were leaching from the tobacco or whether they were being produced during the chewing process			1
@entity34 thinks it 's the latter			0
" the leaves are fine , they will not cause cancer			0
@entity167 will not lead to cancer , but it may accelerate carcinogen to release			0
it 's a hidden danger , " @entity34 said			0
in some countries , authorities have launched awareness campaigns but health officials face an uphill battle in convincing addicts that it 's not worth the buzz			0
in @entity36 , @entity34 says , " people are aware , but it 's just hard to get rid of the addiction			0
" @entity181 recently introduced a ban on the sale and chewing of areca nuts in the capital @entity187 , but that was mainly to rid the city of the unsightly red saliva users spit into the street when they chew			1
in @entity1 , the @entity192 , a non-governmental organization , has started trying to raise public awareness of the risks of betel quids , however its message is about the dangers of pesticides on leaves			1
" long ago , betel leaves were used as medicine but nowadays betel leaves cause oral cancer because of the excessive use of pesticides and insecticides , " the association 's chairman @entity200 told @entity2			1
it 's a theory that 's not supported by any scientific evidence , @entity34 said			0
" there 's absolutely no relation between the two			0
both areca nuts and leaves have very strong resistance to pests " so neither are usually used during cultivation , he said			1
" earlier studies show pesticides may have a connection to lymph cancer or blood cancer , but never oral cancer , " he added			2
despite the evidence , noodle seller @entity16 has no plans to kick the habit			0
he says he needs his 10 parcels a day to stay awake during long shifts at his market stall , which start at 3 a.m. with a trip to the wholesaler , and end at 8 p.m. when he dumps his unsold stock			1
" i 'm working the whole day , it 's a very long day , so when i 'm chewing the betel nut i do n't want to sleep , " he said			2
@entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
