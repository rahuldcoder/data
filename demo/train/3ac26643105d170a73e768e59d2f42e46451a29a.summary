most , if not all , super heroes wear cloaks and masks to hide their identity			2
but how about a burqa ? a new cartoon series in @entity6 is turning stereotypes on their head			1
it 's centered around a woman who does n't wear a burqa in the daytime but puts one on to transform into the " @entity13 " - and what 's more , she 's fighting for female education			1
the cartoon is already the talk of the country and it has n't even launched yet			1
" @entity13 " is a passion project of @entity6 pop star , @entity20			1
" it was in 2010 and i was reading a lot of articles about girls ' schools being shut down by extremists so that was in my mind , " he told @entity22 after i met him at his studio			2
" living in @entity6 , all theses issues are staring you in the face constantly			1
so when you 're creating art , whether it be music or anything else like a cartoon tv series -- you want to incorporate social messages			1
i feel it 's my duty to try and make a positive difference			2
" school teacher by day , by night the @entity13 ( spelled with a ' k ' ) dons a special burqa to protect girls ' schools , fighting the bad guys trying to shut them down			0
. " the @entity13 is a character called @entity46 , orphaned as a child , adopted by a @entity49 master , who is a master of this mystic martial art that i created , called @entity49 -- the art of fighting with books and pens			0
it gives the message of the importance of education and that the pen is mightier than the sword , " @entity20 says			1
the burqa can be a controversial item of clothing			0
for some , the burqa is a symbol of oppression			0
for others , it 's a symbol of freedom from sexism and being viewed as merely a sexual object -- ie. the burqa hides a woman 's body so that a person addresses her as a human being not an object of desire			0
i ask @entity20 why he decided to dress her in one and he has an emphatic explanation			1
" she does n't use the burqa because she 's oppressed			0
she uses it , she chooses to wear it to hide her identity the way superheroes wear their costumes to hide an identity			0
like @entity93 or @entity94 , " he says			0
the @entity95 have hijacked religion , @entity20 tells me , and use it for their own agenda			1
when they rode into @entity100 in 2007 they burned down and bombed girls ' and boys ' schools , he continues			0
their brutal campaign was stopped through a military operation in 2008 and 2009 but years later in 2012 they carried out an attack that shocked the world			0
@entity20 says he also chose the burqa as a way of addressing any argument of the fight for girls ' education in the cartoon being anti-islamic			1
" by wearing a burqa she is showing she is a @entity121 woman and superhero			0
and that she stands for all the good things of @entity124 and the real @entity124 values -- which are equality , woman 's rights , education and peace -- rather than the way @entity124 has been hijacked by radical elements , " he says			2
@entity20 's also teamed up with his celebrity friends to be the voices of the characters			1
some of @entity137 's most famous musical talent also sing tracks to go with the cartoon			2
rapper @entity140 has written " @entity141			0
" rock star @entity142 sings a head - banging " @entity143 , " translated as ' @entity144 , ' about one of the main characters who is trying to shut down girls ' schools			1
there are 13 episodes and aside from the ongoing battle for girls ' education , each covers a different issue affecting @entity6 , including discrimination , child labor , sectarian violence , electricity shortages and protecting the environment			1
" these are really hard hitting issues and you think how can you talk about these issues in a kids ' show ? but it 's being presented in a very entertaining manner , full of adventure , comedy and fun , " @entity20 says			1
@entity20 says he hopes the cartoon will have an impact on @entity6 children who are unable to read or write either themselves or whose parents ca n't read them bedtime stories			1
and just like in fairytales , each episode has a moral at the end of the story			0
" i remember when i was a child , my mother used to read me stories and at the end it would say , ' ok , the moral of the story is this			0
' i used to also read those stories as i learned to read as well			0
that really resonated with me and helped me figure out what my own morals and ethics are			0
" " unfortunately , with the literacy rate so low in @entity6 , a lot of children do n't have that opportunity with parents reading to them or reading themselves			1
in this show , i brought that in as well			2
at the end of each show			2
the @entity13 comes up and says ' ok kids , the moral of this story or this episode was such and such			0
' " the cartoon launches in mid-august , shortly after the @entity121 festival of @entity205 .			2
