-- the tea party movement is an important step closer to doing something it 's done only three times before : oust an incumbent @entity7 senator in a @entity9 primary			1
tea party backed state sen. @entity10 forced incumbent sen. @entity12 into a runoff in @entity15 's @entity7 primary			1
the challenge could give the 5 - year - old grass - roots conservative movement - which so far this year has suffered a string of high profile primary defeats - a much needed injection of energy			2
in tuesday 's other marquee showdown , a candidate who enjoyed both tea party and mainstream @entity7 backing won big in the @entity29 primary , thanks in part to some clever ads that went viral			1
and in @entity33 , which now uses an open primary system where the top two finishers advance to the november election regardless of party affiliation , a moderate @entity7 edged out a tea party - backed conservative for the honor of facing off in the midterms against heavily favored @entity43 gov. @entity42			1
here are the top takeaways from tuesday 's primaries : 1			0
round 2 : tea party vs. establishment in @entity15 : while candidates with @entity39 support have struggled to claim major victories this year , @entity10 's ability to force @entity12 , 76 , into a runoff indicates the grass - roots conservative movement is still rumbling -- and powerful enough to nearly take out a six - term incumbent senator			1
since the tea party started gaining steam in 2009 , the far right has defeated only three incumbent senators in @entity9 primaries : @entity61 of @entity62 ( 2010 ) , @entity63 of @entity64 ( 2010 ) and @entity65 of @entity66 ( 2012 )			1
@entity63 , however , later won the general race with a write - in campaign			1
@entity10 , 42 , and his supporters say @entity12 , who 's running for a seventh term , has been in @entity71 far too long			0
he especially irked grassroots conservatives when he said earlier this year , " the tea party is something i do n't really know a lot about			1
" but it 's unclear who has more momentum going forward			0
@entity10 certainly rallied his supporters tuesday night , vowing to claim victory in the june 24 runoff			0
" i promise you this , whether it 's tomorrow or whether it 's three weeks from tonight , we will stand victorious in this race , " he said			2
but @entity12 supporters also say they 're ready for another round			0
@entity88 , who runs the @entity89 , told @entity0 's @entity90 that they 're " going to get up and rethink " their message			0
" really organize from the ground up , " he added			0
@entity88 said " complacency " among @entity12 voters " hurt us , " and he thinks " they got outshouted			0
" @entity97 , a @entity12 adviser and former adviser to @entity99 , told bash that three weeks allows more time to scrutinize @entity10 's record and ask tough questions			1
but supporters of @entity10 may point to the 2012 @entity29 primary in @entity105 , where a political newcomer known as @entity107 came from behind to push the establishment candidate , lt. gov. @entity108 , into a runoff			2
the extra time gave @entity107 a longer window to build his profile			0
that summer , he rose to national fame and attracted support from high - profile figures like @entity116			2
two months after the primary , @entity107 defeated @entity108 in the runoff			0
@entity10 wo n't have nearly as much time to solidify a victory , but being so close to a win may only make his supporters want it that much more			1
no matter who has more momentum , the runoff certainly seems poised to become another supercharged fight between the establishment and tea party @entity7			1
race gets ugly in the @entity15 mud 2			1
hog wild in @entity132 : the free - for - all that was the @entity132 @entity7 @entity29 primary turned into a landslide victory for @entity135 over three other major @entity9 candidates			1
@entity135 went from a little - known state senator to the front - runner who enjoyed support from major mainstream @entity9 groups and anti-establishment and tea party organizations			1
she also won endorsements from such high - profile republicans as @entity116 , @entity99 and @entity148			1
the big question going into tuesday 's primary was whether @entity135 would crack the 35 % threshold and avoid a runoff			0
if not , the nomination would have been decided a week later by some 2,000 delegates at the @entity9 convention			0
the final public opinion poll going into the primary had @entity135 at 36 %			0
when the primary results were in , @entity135 grabbed 56 % of the vote			0
so how did she do it ? some provocative ads definitely helped			2
i grew up castrating hogs on an @entity132 farm , so when i get to @entity71 , i 'll know how to cut pork , " @entity135 said in the first tv commercial of her campaign			1
that spot , which first aired in late march , not only made @entity135 more recognizable in the @entity132 , but also across the nation			1
a second commercial showed @entity135 , a lieutenant colonel in the @entity172 , riding up to a gun range on a motorcycle			0
" with little name id and even less money to introduce herself to @entity182 earlier this year , her clever ads were undoubtedly the spark that fueled tonight 's impressive victory , " @entity132 @entity175 consultant @entity175 , a former chairman of the state @entity9 , told @entity0 on tuesday night			1
and @entity132 @entity185 strategist @entity185 , who is supporting @entity135 , said " the ads were successful because they were genuine @entity135			1
she has been under - estimated from the beginning , and proved tonight she is a candidate to be reckoned with in november			1
" @entity135 joked about her now - famous hog castration commercial in her victory speech , saying " i grew up ... canning food and feeding hogs on our family farm , and yes , some of you may know i did more than just feed the hogs			2
" @entity135 hopes to make history in november as the first woman to represent @entity132 in @entity200			2
in the midterm elections , she 'll face @entity43 rep. @entity203 , who was unopposed in his party 's primary			2
the winner of november 's general election will succeed longtime @entity43 sen. @entity208 , who is retiring at the end of the year			0
@entity7 feel they have a good shot at flipping @entity208 's seat , in their drive to retake the @entity29			0
@entity9 candidate gets mainstream and anti-establishment backing 3			2
open primaries have consequences no one questioned whether @entity219 @entity42 , who 's bidding for an unprecedented fourth term as @entity33 governor , was the overwhelming favorite in tuesday 's @entity33 primary			0
the big question was whom the incumbent would face off with come november			0
for the first time in a gubernatorial race , @entity33 held an open , or " jungle , " primary , where all candidates compete in a single contest and the first and second place finishers , regardless of party affiliation , advance to the general election			1
second place went to former @entity239 administration treasury official @entity238 , who edged out state rep. @entity240 , a fellow @entity7			0
@entity238 's a moderate who is best known for managing the @entity242 ( @entity242 ) , better known as the @entity244 bailouts , during president @entity239 's last year in office			0
he 's also a supporter of immigration reform , same - sex marriage and abortion rights			0
the tea party - backed @entity240 is an outspoken supporter of the rights of gun owners and a fierce opponent of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants			1
@entity238 's victory could make a difference for the party 's chances in the general election			0
some @entity9 strategists told @entity0 they were concerned that if @entity240 won , it would hurt @entity7 candidates in down - ballot races in a state where the general election electorate is much more moderate than that of the @entity9 primary			1
it 's also more than fair to say that in a traditional @entity9 primary , which is dominated by conservatives , @entity238 would have had a much tougher time beating @entity240			0
" everybody 's going to study it and find things to love and hate about the open primary system , " said @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity272			0
" there are some grass - roots conservatives who think establishment republicans are looking for every way under the sun to weaken them			0
they will now point to the open primary system as an example , since their party 's gubernatorial nominee in @entity33 is a man who not only supported the @entity244 bailouts , but actually administered them , " @entity272 added			0
@entity99 's candidates clean up : @entity99 has the @entity288 this election season			1
the 2012 @entity7 presidential nominee continued his winning streak tuesday with three of the @entity9 candidates he endorsed winning their primaries			0
@entity99 campaigned with @entity135 in @entity132 and cut an online ad for the @entity295 supporting her candidacy			1
his endorsement adds some establishment @entity9 backing to the conservative favorite , who also enjoys support from tea party power players like @entity116			1
in @entity33 , @entity99 backed @entity238 , who came in second and now advances to november 's general election			2
also in @entity33 , @entity99 threw his support behind former state rep. @entity309 , who co-chaired both of his presidential bids , in the state 's 25th @entity313			1
@entity309 came in first in the vote count , which sends him on to the general election			0
the winner of that contest will go on to succeed retiring @entity9 rep. @entity320 , chairman of the @entity321			0
after failing to nab the @entity322 from president @entity323 , @entity99 backed away from the spotlight briefly before jumping back into the political fray , surprising many with his involvement in the 2014 election cycle			2
so far this election cycle , he 's endorsed or donated money to some 20 candidates , many of them @entity9 establishment favorites who backed @entity99 in his @entity322 runs			1
two weeks ago , two other candidates he had backed scored high - profile primary victories			2
@entity99 endorsed and recorded a robocall for dr. @entity336 , a pediatric neurosurgeon who won the @entity9 @entity29 primary in @entity338 over a more conservative state lawmaker			1
the same night , eight - term rep. @entity340 of @entity341 beat back a serious primary challenge from a tea party - backed candidate			1
@entity99 had endorsed @entity345 and starred in a television commercial put out by the @entity295 that backed @entity345			2
asked last week about his winning track record when it comes to primary endorsements , @entity99 told reporters : " i wish i can take credit for that			2
the candidates take credit for that , and i am sure we will have some successes and some that are not successful			0
" @entity360 primary race too close to call primary problems : @entity9 women struggle to come out on top			2

close race in @entity15 shows tea party is far from dead
little - known state senator turns ads into win in @entity132
@entity99 has had more success promoting candidates than he did as a candidate
