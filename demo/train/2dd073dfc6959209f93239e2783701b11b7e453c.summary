-- hundreds of students in @entity2 walked out of classes this week in response to recent attempts by the conservative - leaning @entity6 to change the school curriculum			1
one of the board 's most controversial initiatives is to avoid historical instances of civil disobedience while promoting " patriotism , respect for authority and free enterprise			1
" imagine for a moment : what if the board succeeds ? what if we step into a time machine and travel to such a future ? in such a world , not only have those pesky moments of civil disobedience been put in their proper place , but also their dangerous effects have finally started turning around			1
for example , the late 1800s look a lot different in @entity2 's textbook in the future			1
take that troublemaker @entity33 , who spent 50 years of her life fighting for women 's right to vote			0
while current textbooks applaud her courage in the face of a trial , conviction and $ 100 fine for illegally casting a ballot in the 1872 presidential election , the @entity2 textbook of the future might well ensure that her story is blotted out			1
and even though there 's no repealing women 's right to vote , future generations of girls at least know never to protest against continuing forms of gender inequality , such as being paid less for doing the same job as a man			2
to fight for equal pay would be unpatriotic , disrespectful , and contemptuous of @entity54 , who -- let 's face it -- ultimately know what 's best for us			2
the progressive movement of the early 20th century would likely look different in @entity2 's textbook of the future			1
while current textbooks detail the illegal labor strikes that eventually led to things like a 40 - hour work week and workplace safety laws , future textbooks may make no mention of it			2
in the future , students would understand that it 's unpatriotic to question an employer for any reason			2
asking for things like cost - of - living raises just makes companies want to leave the @entity76 and go someplace where they can hire people who will work for even less money			0
the lesson : if you want a job at all , better keep your mouth shut and watch your wages decline			0
finally , in the @entity2 textbooks of the future , the civil rights movement could be recast in the proper light			1
for example , @entity90 and @entity91 could be depicted as disobedient rabble - rousers rather than brave fighters for equality			0
how dare @entity90 -- a black woman -- sit in the front of the bus ? in @entity99 , @entity100 , in 1955 , that was illegal , not to mention disrespectful and unpatriotic			0
and how dare the rev. dr. @entity91 lead peaceful marches for equality without a permit ? that was also illegal in many @entity106 cities , and he rightfully went to jail for the crime			0
thus , @entity2 students of the future would know that fighting for equality among the races is dangerous and might get you into trouble			1
best to just accept the status quo despite stubborn discrepancies between the races in categories like student achievement , household income , and incarceration			0
no , i do n't really have a time machine , and no one can predict the future			0
but we can and should look at the past with a critical eye			0
our history is filled with seemingly powerless people banding together , following their conscience , and making a positive change , despite the anger of rich and powerful people , who like things to stay just the way they are			0
as we face a future of widening inequality , resurgent discrimination , and decreasing wages , we would do well to follow the example of the @entity2 students who are peacefully disobeying authorities and fighting for a truthful account of history in their textbooks .			1
