@entity1 it 's midnight in the capital of @entity4			1
while some people are slowly walking home through the neon - lit streets , or getting ready to hit the club scene , others are on their way to a more unusual nocturnal hangout -- a bookstore			1
the @entity14 store in central @entity1 opens 24 hours and has more night owl visitors than most @entity17 bookstores could dream of during their daytime hours			1
here , young and old sit side - by - side on small steps or around reading tables , deeply engrossed in literary worlds			2
others stand and some sit on the floor , all reading in hushed silence as soft classical music seeps out from the speakers			0
" people in @entity1 do many things by night , " says @entity29 , a teacher who sits on a step in the middle of the store , skimming through the children 's classic " when @entity35 was there " by @entity37			1
" you can go to the night market , shopping or nightclubbing			0
i read , " she adds , before telling me to keep my voice down			0
" there are people trying to concentrate on their books here			0
" trend dodger the @entity49 , that runs the five - story store , opened its first branch in @entity1 in 1989			1
today , 25 years on , the company runs 42 stores in @entity4 , one in @entity54 and has ambitious plans to expand in @entity56			1
the chain 's rise comes at a time when bookstores in the @entity61 and @entity62 are struggling to survive , with some forced to shut down due to growing pressure from online competitors like @entity65			1
in the @entity68 , a third of all independent bookstores have closed down in the last decade , according to the @entity69			0
and the last major book retailer in the @entity61 -- @entity71 -- is shutting stores as its management struggles to meet the challenges from its digital rivals			1
@entity14 has hit upon a concept to dodge this trend -- making the store as much a place for books as it is for design , fashion and home styling , small cafes and restaurants			1
it reported revenue of around $ 425 million in 2013 , with books accounting for some 40 percent of sales , according to company spokesman @entity89			2
sales are expected to increase by almost eight percent this year			0
hipsters and bookworms the mix of literature and design has made the store a hangout for hipsters as well as bookworms , allowing the company to shrug off the challenges of the digital age			1
" it is our belief that the more digital the society ( becomes ) , the more we treasure the warmth of the interconnection , " @entity89 says			0
" this core idea makes @entity14 barely impacted by the changes of the industry			0
" in some stores , books and products are displayed next to each other at the same table			2
the 24 - hour store at @entity118 has five floors , each dedicated to different categories , like fashion , music , food or events			1
the top floor is all books			0
@entity128 and @entity129 , two friends from @entity1 , are typical customers			0
they sit in the bookstore caf√© sipping hot chocolate and coffee and plan to spend the night gossiping			2
but why here and not just a bar or restaurant ? " it 's a cool place , a bit like @entity141 in @entity142 , " @entity129 says			0
" many cool people hang out here			0
some come here to read , others just to kill time and meet friends			0
it 's like a place for modern culture and it 's close to some of the best nightclubs and bars			0
" online , many reviewers say the bookstore is a great place to pick up girls or guys , although none of the people i spoke to confessed to that			2
censorship ? it has also become a magnet for tourists visiting the island , some from the mainland @entity56 in search for literature banned under the @entity172 's strict censorship			1
one of every four visitors to @entity4 visits an @entity14 , according to the firm			1
however , @entity14 has come under fire over allegations of self - censorship as it gears up to tap the @entity56 market			1
earlier this year , the company reportedly stopped selling sensitive books about @entity182 and human rights issues , possibly in an attempt to appease @entity56 authorities becoming uncomfortable ahead of the planned new stores in @entity186 and @entity187			1
the company denied the allegations and i found books by both @entity192 and @entity193 , the supposedly banned dissident writers			2
it 's also not clear whether the company will be able to replicate its 24 - hour model outside @entity4 where the bookstores have become a cultural phenomenon			1
the chain 's @entity54 store revised its round - the - clock schedule after a month - long trial , although it still opens until 11pm on weekdays and midnight on friday and saturday			1
counter-intuitive ? @entity14 's success may seem counter-intuitive especially when it seems most late - night visitors treat it like a library , leaving empty handed after hours of free reading			2
@entity14 's @entity89 claims that the business is successful because it creates " a friendly environment " and treats " books as well as the visitors with great hospitality			0
" that 's good news for @entity217 , a 30 - year - old police officer reading about global manufacturing trends on a recent friday night			0
going out to drink alcohol is too expensive , while reading books at the store is free , he explains			2
" i love this place			0
i come here every weekend			0

bookstore chain in @entity4 thrives while stores elsewhere fold
main store opens 24 hours , *attracting* hipsters as well as bookworms
company has ambitious plans to expand in @entity56
