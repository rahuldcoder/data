@entity0 , @entity1 -- with space shuttle @entity3 on its way to upgrade the @entity5 , that leaves one shuttle , @entity7 , at the ready on the other launch pad here			1
space shuttle @entity7 , in background , sits poised to launch in case @entity3 , in foreground , meets trouble			1
and that 's where everybody at @entity15 wants it to stay			0
" we have high confidence that we 're just having that thing over on pad b to make it look nice , " said mission flight director @entity18			0
endeavour is far more than a postcard picture -- it 's on standby in case something goes seriously wrong with the @entity3 mission			1
for example , @entity15 has estimated there 's a 1 - in - 221 chance the shuttle could be struck and crippled by orbiting space debris			2
if such an incident were to thrust the seven @entity3 astronauts into danger , @entity7 would blast off within days in a last - ditch attempt to save them			1
@entity41 believes his crew is up to the task			0
" i feel as confident about our ability to pull this off , if need be , as i would any other mission , " he said			0
the idea of a standby rescue spacecraft grew out of the 2003 @entity52 disaster , in which that shuttle disintegrated over @entity55 during re-entry into the @entity58 's atmosphere			2
but until now , there 's been no need			0
all the previous missions since @entity52 have gone to the @entity62			0
the crew of a damaged shuttle could take refuge there for months if need be until another shuttle was readied to retrieve them			2
but @entity3 is going to @entity5 , whose orbit is n't anywhere near the space station			1
if their spacecraft malfunctioned , the seven - member @entity3 crew would have to survive aboard -- probably for days -- until they could be rescued			1
" in this case it 's a much shorter fuse , " @entity41 said			0
" consumables like food and oxygen would run out quickly			0
so the reason we 've gotten this crew trained and spooled up and ready to go on literally a moment 's notice is because they [ @entity3 's crew ] have no place comfortable to go stay for a long period of time			1
" but the rescue would be no cakewalk			0
@entity7 would need to pull up underneath @entity3 and hook on to the other shuttle using its robotic arm			1
over the course of two days , the seven @entity3 astronauts would spacewalk over to @entity7 by holding on to a tether line strung between the two spaceships			1
@entity3 mission specialist @entity100 would go first -- and , actually , twice			2
@entity100 would spacewalk to @entity7 , grab an extra @entity101 ( extravehicular mobility unit ) spacesuit and take it back to @entity3			1
he would then return to @entity7 with one of the @entity3 astronauts not trained in spacewalking			1
with the @entity3 crew safely aboard , @entity7 would pull away and begin preparing to head home			1
@entity110 said that knowing @entity41 and the other three members of the @entity7 crew are ready in case of an emergency gives him peace of mind			1
" even in the worst - possible imaginable case , we can stay up there and last until somebody comes up and gets us , " @entity110 said			0
" so it feels like we have all our bases covered			0
" so what would happen to @entity3 ? @entity41 said mission leaders would prepare the crippled shuttle for what they call a " disposal burn " -- a safe , remotely controlled landing of @entity3			1
" if it comes to it , we certainly do n't want a space shuttle coming in over a populated area , " he said			2
" so we want to control the burn so it does end up in the ocean			0
" in all , eleven astronauts would be stuffed into @entity7			2
a space shuttle has never carried that many			2
the four @entity7 crew members would hang out in the flight deck , while the seven @entity3 astronauts would squeeze into the mid-deck area			1
the journey back to @entity58 would be uncomfortable			0
but @entity18 , the flight director , says that would n't matter as long as everyone was safe			0
" wrap me in bubble wrap and get me home safely , i would n't care , " he said			0
" i would n't care how cramped it is			0

the shuttle endeavour and its crew are standing by in case of a emergency in space
@entity7 would blast off to rescue the crew of shuttle *atlantis*
@entity3 blasted off monday to upgrade the @entity5
a rescue mission would involve two tricky days of spacewalks between shuttles
