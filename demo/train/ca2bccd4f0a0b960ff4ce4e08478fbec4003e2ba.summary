-- if democracy had existed in ancient @entity3 , then not a single pyramid would have been built			2
all because free people in democratic countries will only agree to build pyramids for good wages , and good wages are incompatible with a luxurious lifestyle of the @entity11 family			2
but if the country has no @entity14 then it will not cross anybody 's mind to build pyramids			0
if " @entity18 democracy " had existed in ancient @entity3 then the pyramids would not have been built , not only because of a lack of money for salaries but also because of the ordinary theft of half of the funds allocated for their construction			1
i 'm not actually a big proponent of building pyramids			0
but " @entity18 democracy " , i like it			1
what is more , it feeds me			0
not in the sense that it provides some kind of social security and promises a good retirement			0
no ! with enviable regularity " @entity18 democracy " feeds me with plots for novels , as well as offering so many potential fictional heroes that no one writer could fit it all in even if he writes two thick novels in a year			1
therefore because of a lack of enough lifetime to write hundreds of novels , i have to write some of the real - life stories just like this , in short articles			1
the presidency of @entity49 started in 2010 with a slogan : " we are building a new country "			0
billboards with the slogan decorated all the country 's cities , villages and roads			0
so , everyone understands that major construction work is starting , which means that smaller signs of the kind that adorn building sites will soon appear , reading : " sorry for the inconvenience			2
" anyway the construction boom first started in the capital , @entity67			0
on the hills overlooking the @entity69 work began on a presidential helipad and overpass leading to the government quarter in the city			0
at the same time work began on a helipad near the mountain at the summit of which is buried national @entity18 poet @entity80 , a hundred kilometers from @entity67			1
they said that from now on for the effective use of time of the head of state the president will only go and see the grave of the great poet by helicopter			0
the helipads having not been completed the country set about building stadiums for @entity97 to be held in just a month , new airport terminals in the cities where matches will take place and , of course , set about the repair of the roads on which hundreds of thousands of fans from @entity101 will doubtless travel on when they come to @entity18			1
stadiums seem to have been built and officials from @entity104 were very pleased , roads are still under construction but the helipads they just ca n't manage to sort out			0
it would be a pity if fans arrive in @entity67 or elsewhere in their helicopters and they have nowhere to land			0
of course international @entity111 might arrive by helicopter to @entity67 , @entity113 and @entity114 to support their national teams			0
yet there is currently a big question mark over the arrival of presidents and prime ministers			0
they first call for @entity49 , or to be exact , the state of @entity18 , to release @entity123			1
first for treatment and then completely			0
but in a normal country the president can not simply release a person from prison ! was n't it the judge who put her there and not the president ? there was an investigation , there was a trial			2
the court sentenced her to seven years in prison , but the investigation continues and will soon add one or two other sentences to her first making her a permanent resident of @entity145 female penal colony			2
therefore it would make more sense for the heads of state and presidents to send their request directly to the judge @entity151 who announced the verdict , and not to president @entity49 who does not deal directly with such matters as there are more important things in the state than @entity123			1
for example the literary process			0
but more about that a bit later			0
the paradox of the current political situation is the fact that @entity123 is getting in the way of @entity49 from " building a new country "			1
he hoped that while in detention she would not bother him , but as it turned out , while in prison she disturbs him and the building of a new country even more			2
hundreds of government officials from former @entity174 states and other foreign countries require and request a meeting with her , distracting the " builders of a new country " -- a large and active clan of businessmen representing the eastern regions of @entity18			1
and for some reason no one wants to meet @entity49 ! he organized a summit for heads of state of central and eastern @entity101 in @entity187 and presidents simply refused to come to it in a sign of protest			0
however it is not all bad			0
a few days ago the president of @entity194 finally arrived to visit president @entity49			0
the @entity18 president pleased with the respect shown to him by the president of the neighboring country relaxed and talked , which seldom happens to him			1
he said to the @entity194 president , but loud enough so the whole world heard , that for both @entity18 and @entity101 it would be useful to take a break from their relationship and to forget about each other for a while			1
clearly @entity101 is tired of @entity18 but president @entity49 has made it clear that @entity18 is sick of @entity101 , too			1
moreover , neither @entity208 nor the @entity209 are behaving in a humane way and also call for the release of the above mentioned @entity123 as if she was a common victim of judicial abuse			1
@entity213 has somehow also forgotten that a criminal case was opened against her in @entity208 ten years ago and several @entity208 defense ministry officials were sent to prison involved in the fraud of @entity219 , which at that time was overseen by @entity123			1
looking for @entity18 politicians and officials who have never broken the law is a tedious and thankless task			1
among political analysts there is an idea that if you want to put people in jail then you should imprison not just political rivals but all those guilty of something			2
however , the minister of internal affairs recently announced that among all the people arrested for corruption the majority are members of the ruling party - the @entity238 - and not the opposition			2
he immediately added that this is completely logical , as the @entity238 is the largest in @entity18 and almost all government officials are members of it			1
do n't think that i am defending someone or standing up for @entity123 or @entity246 who was also criticized by the @entity238 for her public statements			1
i just think that if the @entity238 would spend five year putting in prison all the corrupt members of the @entity251 , and then , cleansed from corruption , @entity123 would come to power and spend five years imprisoning those corrupt members of the @entity238 , the situation would clearly improve and the parties themselves would be reduced to a human scale			1
this would be a big positive			0
yes , the country is looking forward to @entity97 , but this political " football " without rules has been going on in @entity18 for two years already and during this time the two major political parties have simply trampled the " football field " , which is @entity18 itself			1
at the moment it 's a one - sided game and it 's clear that the ruling party is winning			2
meanwhile the president has somehow hidden from public view behind the very high and well - protected fence of his country residence			2
near to it a new building with an office for the president was constructed			0
@entity277 , but when completed this new building immediately became the property of some @entity281 off - shore company that the government now pays monthly rent to			2
it means he will only visit his official office in @entity67 when absolutely necessary			0
for example when presidents of western countries come to their senses and stop their boycott of him			0
until that moment he may remain alone in his " @entity281 " forest - land of the former state residence " @entity295 " that as it turned out now , too , belongs to the @entity281 off - shore company			2
he is secluding himself , i think , to sit down at a large , multi-volume novel			0
indeed in a tax return this year he wrote that he had received an advance of $ 2 million for not - yet - written literary work			2
however he did not received this money from a publisher but an unknown printer in his hometown of @entity113 in eastern @entity18			1
so what lies ahead is a lot of work			0
the authors of real best - sellers in @entity18 get no more than $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 per book			1
so count how many best - sellers he will have to write			2
at least one of these books should be devoted to a woman			0
that is , to @entity123			1
but first there is the question of genre			0
the novel will probably start as a drama and end up as a black comedy			0
by the way , ten years ago one of @entity123 's political aides contacted me and asked me to write a novel about her with the title " @entity330 "			1
the plot , a conspiracy against @entity123			1
but soon three novels were released in @entity18 with a similar plot and one of the books was called " @entity339 "			1
she wanted to become a literary heroine and she has become one			0
she wanted and still wants to be the president of @entity18			1
in her life , @entity123 has always achieved what she wanted			1
and if @entity49 loses his grip on power and does n't pass it to his heir she will pick it up and then the " black comedy " will continue and become both " horror " and " action "			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity355			1

*abundance* of plots for novels from @entity18 politics , says author @entity355
in - fighting between major political parties has trampled @entity18
despite being in prison @entity123 still dominates foreign relations with @entity18
