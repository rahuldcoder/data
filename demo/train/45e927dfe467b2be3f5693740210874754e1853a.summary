@entity0 -- @entity3 media are buzzing with reports that right - wing nationalist @entity5 may become @entity3 's next foreign minister			1
@entity5 is loathed by ultra-orthodox parties because of his support for a @entity11 state			2
the appointment of @entity5 , a polarizing figure in @entity3 politics , could complicate the stalled peace talks with the @entity11			2
it could also further strain relations between @entity3 and moderate @entity19 countries			0
prime minister - designate @entity20 is still in the process of forming @entity3 's next government			1
@entity3 newspaper @entity24 reported this week that it is likely that he will select @entity5 as foreign minister			2
the paper quoted a source close to the negotiations between @entity20 's @entity31 and @entity5 's @entity32			1
@entity5 would replace outgoing foreign minister @entity33 , head of the moderate @entity35 party , which secured the most number of parliament seats in last month 's election -- but not enough to form a coalition government			2
@entity20 has been unable to woo moderate parties , including @entity35 , into his government			0
he may be forced to concede some key ministerial posts to @entity5 's party , which would be the second largest faction in the new coalition government behind @entity31			0
@entity20 has vowed to form a broad - based government , but it is unclear how he can keep that promise since @entity35 and the moderate @entity49 have indicated that they plan to form an opposition to a @entity31 - led government			1
" although @entity20 has reportedly largely agreed to making @entity5 his foreign minister , he is thought to still be weighing the potential political damage the appointment of the hawkish politicians would do to the image of his government , " @entity24 reported			1
the @entity58 , quoting unnamed diplomatic sources , reported that although @entity3 's ties with western @entity60 may suffer if @entity5 becomes foreign minister , he may help improve the jewish state 's ties with @entity64 and eastern @entity60			1
@entity5 is in a peculiar spot on the @entity3 political spectrum he is routinely categorized as a right - wing hawk			2
but as a secularist who supports an independent @entity11 state , he is loathed by @entity3 's ultra-orthodox parties , including @entity71 , which holds 11 seats in the @entity73 and is another potential member of @entity20 's coalition			1
it is unclear how moderate @entity19 countries , who are still outraged over @entity3 's recent military operation in @entity80 , would react to foreign minister @entity5			1
@entity81 , one of only four @entity84 countries that have full diplomatic ties with @entity3 , has been trying to negotiate a broader cease - fire between @entity3 and @entity80 's @entity88 leadership			1
it is unclear whether those indirect negotiations would continue under the new @entity3 government			0
@entity5 has said he is unwilling to directly or indirectly negotiate with @entity88 , which is considered a terrorist organization by @entity3 for its refusal to recognize @entity3 and renounce violence against the jewish state			0
@entity5 does support " the creation of a viable @entity11 state , " which is the bedrock of @entity100 policy in the region			0
he restated that support in a @entity104 article , written shortly after last month 's election			0
that puts him at odds with @entity20 , who does not support a two - state solution			2
however , @entity5 's support of a @entity11 state comes at a high price			0
he has stated that he would oppose any peace agreement that would divide @entity0 as a shared capital between @entity3 and a @entity11 state			0
@entity5 , who migrated from the @entity116 to @entity3 in 1978 , has also called for @entity3 's boundaries to be redrawn to exclude much of @entity3 's @entity19 minority , a move that would strip them of their citizenship			1
palestinians with @entity3 citizenship make up about 20 percent of the jewish state 's population			0
@entity5 frequently clashes with @entity19 members of the @entity73 and has called for them to be tried and executed for meeting with leaders of @entity129 and @entity88			1
he wants all @entity73 members , both @entity19 and @entity131 , to prove their loyalty by swearing allegiance to the @entity3 flag and national anthem			1
@entity19 @entity73 member @entity136 has warned that @entity5 's rising popularity reflects a dangerous trend			1
" we are talking about a pure and obvious fascist phenomena invading the @entity3 society , " @entity136 said			0
" during the last years , racism became mainstream in the @entity3 society			0
" @entity5 's supporters credit him with offering clear solutions to @entity3 's complicated problems			0
in his article in @entity104 , he rejected accusations from his critics that his party is racist			0
" i stand at the head of the most diverse political party in the @entity73 , " he wrote , noting that his party 's @entity73 members have included four women , three people with disabilities , a @entity104 convert and a zionist			2
" i find it a bit rich to be called a bigot			0
" he said that he " look [ s ] forward to working with president @entity161 " since " @entity100 - @entity3 relations are as strong as ever , and that our shared values and interests make our friendship unshakable			0
" @entity167 of the @entity168 said @entity5 is tapping into the dark side of @entity3 ' concerns about security , particularly as militants in @entity80 continue to routinely fire rockets on southern @entity3 " @entity5 is riding an ugly wave of resentment among many @entity176 toward the @entity19 - @entity3 minority , " he said			1
@entity179 political correspondent @entity178 recently wrote that @entity5 has become " the leader of those who lost any hope or faith in the possibility of securing peace or engaging in talks with the @entity19			1
" " the war in @entity80 indeed restored the public 's sense of security and lowered the anxiety level , yet @entity5 is perceived as the man who will know how to do what needs to be done so that no more missiles land around here , " she wrote .			2
