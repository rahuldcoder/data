where would the world be without them ? yes , the @entity5 might have taken over the world had @entity7 not invented whisky , but what about rum , gin , vodka , beer and wine ? we 'll likely never know the answer to that question , but we can find out exactly how the drinks that rule the world are made			1
whichever flavor you like to toss back , somewhere there 's a booze tour with your name on it			1
from @entity27 to @entity28 , here are 10 of our favorites			1
@entity30 : @entity31 , @entity32 @entity32 's oldest and smallest distillery , @entity31 lovingly crafts its bourbon in small batches			1
maybe that 's why it 's the official bourbon of the @entity38			1
at the distillery , also a @entity40 , visitors take a guided tour that explains the history of bourbon , the bottling process and how @entity31 does something special with all five sources of bourbon flavor			1
for example , they do n't just use water , they use deep limestone well water			1
big difference ( as they 'll explain )			2
best of all , guests get to linger with the award - winning craft bourbon			1
on the @entity62 to @entity61 tour you can dive deeper into the bourbon - making process			1
or you can just start serving up mint juleps			2
wine : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 grape for grape , this family - owned estate 100 kilometers north of @entity73 pumps out some of the best wine in @entity75			2
it helps that @entity67 has the perfect climate for it : cool , rainy winters and hot , dry summers			0
on the two - hour tour , visitors take to the underground cellars and walk the hillside vineyards , covering topics like viticulture , climate conditions and grape management			1
then it 's on to sampling four of the estate 's @entity91 wines			1
the @entity93 contains some amazingly smoky notes from oak aging			0
cost : @entity96 $ 34			0
rum : @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity28 it 's the classic rum stereotype -- turquoise waters , tropical island , white - sand beaches			1
as the birthplace of rum , @entity28 is home to the oldest rum in existence , @entity98			1
launched in 1703 , @entity98 is a smooth , medium - bodied rum combining notes of ripe banana , almond , vanilla , coffee and chocolate			1
it gets those last two from an aging process that involves @entity32 oak barrels that previously contained bourbon			1
at the @entity98 visitor center in @entity99 ( near the capital , @entity123 ) , travelers learn about these rum properties in the brand museum			1
later , they snoop around a @entity28 rum shop and sample two of @entity98 's finest rums in the official bar			1
an optional lunch is served outdoors , with a @entity98 punch , naturally			0
cost : @entity96 $ 7 - $ 50			0
lager : @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity27 in 1926 , the @entity137 brewery in @entity135 , @entity27 ( which has been in existence since 1366 ) , produced a beer so bright it was given the name @entity137 , @entity141 for " star			1
" which goes to show sometimes a company requires a few centuries to discover its true calling			0
today , @entity137 is sold in more than 80 countries			0
the hourlong tour at the @entity137 brewery divulges all the beer 's secrets ( so they say )			1
visitors sample a cool @entity137 in the cozy @entity154 bar before being guided to the @entity137 shop , where they can stock up on chalices			0
and maybe a bottle opener			0
cost : € 8.50 ( u.s. $ 11.30 )			0
@entity158 : @entity159 , @entity160 @entity161 is like a beer milkshake and the tour of the brand 's headquarters is just as filling			1
it starts in the atrium next to the world 's largest pint glass , which rises up through the middle of the seven - story building			1
as the thorough and at times interactive tour moves up each floor , visitors learn about the beer 's state - of - the - art brewing process , its " cooperage " ( barrel - making ) and how it 's transported to more than 150 countries			1
awaiting at the top is a pint of @entity161 ( certificate included ) in the @entity159 , which affords visitors a 360 - degree view of @entity160			1
there 's a reason the @entity159 is the no. 1 attraction in @entity5			1
cost : € 16.50 ( u.s. $ 22 )			0
whisky : @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 @entity188 is the world 's most awarded single - malt scotch whisky , having claimed more big - time international medals since 2000 than any other single - malt scotch			1
in the heart of the @entity198 , its distillery is nearly as decorated			0
the free classic tour runs through 19th - century warehouses and mash rooms and includes three drams of @entity188			2
for a more in - depth look ( and more chest - hair - producing whisky samples ) , visitors can opt for the explorers tour or even the pioneers tour , where they can taste a 30 - year - old whisky and procure a rare , cask - strength bottle of @entity188			2
cost : free to £ 75 ( u.s. $ 121 )			0
tequila : @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 if premium tequila is your drink , @entity215 , @entity214 , and a locomotive known as the @entity217 is your trip			0
in this case , the @entity217 is a literal train			0
thirty kilometers later , visitors arrive at @entity225 , home of the award - winning and picturesque @entity227 distillery			2
surrounded by mountains and agave fields , the tour takes in the original factory and a few 100 % agave tequilas ( silver , reposado , añejo )			2
throw in a mariachi band and a little @entity214 folk dancing and it could be a wedding night			0
cost : 100 pesos ( @entity96 $ 7.90 ) and up			0
vodka : 45th @entity242 , @entity243 about 50 miles east of @entity244 , @entity245 , 45th @entity242 is a small , family - owned distillery in @entity247 , @entity243			0
while their resources may be modest , they produce one hell of a vodka , ultra-clean and as neutral as @entity253			0
it costs a mere $ 5 to take the distillery tour			2
visitors observe the patient fermentation of mash and slow , small - batch distilling processes			0
then comes a sample of their best stuff in the tasting room			0
these @entity263 also churn out a pretty solid bourbon			2
cider : @entity267 's @entity266 , @entity268 , @entity269 @entity267 's makes a number of ciders , most notably the @entity272 , a cloudy cider with a hefty bite , hence the name and snake on the bottle			2
visitors can explore the distillery , bottling facility , underground cellars and museum and learn about the process of making award - winning cider			0
or , they can take a tractor ride through apple orchards in the valley below , have lunch and a slew of ciders in the restaurant , even pet the farm animals			0
it 's all kid - friendly			2
cost : £ 7.00 ( u.s. $ 11 )			0
gin : @entity296 , @entity297 ok , this is n't much of a distillery tour			2
the @entity300 is small ; tours are informal and do n't last long			0
the hook here is the distillery , located in the hip , converted - warehouse - heavy neighborhood of @entity303 , @entity304 , attached to a fully functioning bar called @entity310			0
in this laid - back , exposed - brick haunt , the distillery 's hulking steel and copper still are seen through a large window			2
cocktails are available , made with the distillery 's two gins , the citrus @entity319 and the strong ( 57 % @entity322 ) @entity321 's @entity320			2
a distillery - produced rye is on its way			0
