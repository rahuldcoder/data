@entity0 faces a death sentence in @entity2 for apostasy after a court ruled she converted from @entity5			1
now the 27 - year - old @entity7 woman , a wife and mother expecting another child , embarks on a long and unpredictable legal journey			1
a variety of factors -- @entity2 's legal system , differences between its constitution and @entity17 law imposed by the sentencing judge , her pregnancy -- ensure there will no execution any time soon			1
@entity24 's lawyer argues the sentence should not stand , and an international outcry could pressure @entity2 's government to intervene			1
even if the sentence stands , @entity17 law as practiced in @entity2 prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an expectant woman until two years after she gives birth			1
here are some questions and answers on what happens now : what is this all about ? on thursday , a @entity39 court convicted @entity24 of apostasy , or the renunciation of faith , and sentenced her to death			1
@entity24 was born to a @entity2 @entity46 father and an @entity48 mother			2
her father left when she was 6 , and she was raised by her mother as a @entity7			2
her lawyer , @entity52 , said the case started after @entity24 's brother filed a complaint against her			2
the brother alleged @entity24 had gone missing for several years and that her family was shocked to find she had married a @entity7 man			2
because her father was @entity46 , the @entity17 law court considered her to be the same			0
it refused to recognize her marriage to a @entity7 and also convicted her of adultery , with an additional sentence of 100 lashes			2
before imposing the sentence , the court gave her an opportunity to recant her @entity7 faith , but @entity52 said @entity24 refused to do so , declaring : " i am a @entity7 , and i will remain a @entity7			1
" attempts by @entity71 to contact @entity2 's justice minister and foreign affairs minister about the case were unsuccessful			1
can she appeal ? @entity52 told @entity71 on friday that he plans to ask an appeals court to review the sentence , and could file the request as soon as sunday			0
that will begin a legal process in which the case works its way through @entity2 's @entity82 and up to the @entity85 , the nation 's highest , he said			1
there was no definite timetable for the appeal process , according to @entity52 , who said any death sentence must be ratified by both the @entity82 and @entity85			0
what is the basis of the appeal ? @entity52 argues that @entity2 's constitution allows religious conversion without restriction			2
" i am very much optimistic that the appeal court will reverse the death sentence issued by the primary court , " he said			2
@entity99 of the @entity100 agreed			0
she said the verdict goes against @entity2 's " own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law			1
" however , @entity2 has a history of religious discrimination			0
under president @entity112 , the @entity114 nation " continues to engage in systematic , ongoing and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief , " the @entity107 said in its 2014 report			0
the country imposes @entity17 law on @entity46 and @entity118 alike and punishes acts of " indecency " and " immorality " by floggings and amputations , the commission said			0
" conversion from @entity5 is a crime punishable by death , suspected converts to @entity131 face societal pressures , and government security personnel intimidate and sometimes torture those suspected of conversion , " said the commission appointed by the @entity125 and president			0
since 1999 , the @entity136 has called @entity2 one of the worst offenders of religious rights			2
do her pregnancy and family situation make a difference ? @entity24 is eight months pregnant and has a 20 - month - old son who stays with her in prison			0
@entity52 said her husband , @entity147 , uses a wheelchair and " totally depends on her for all details of his life			0
" as practiced in @entity2 , @entity17 law prohibits the execution of pregnant women			1
instead , the sentence is delayed until two years after lactation			0
in past cases involving pregnant or nursing women , the @entity2 government waited until the mother weaned her child before carrying out the sentence , said @entity164 spokeswoman @entity163			1
according to @entity52 , @entity24 is having a difficult pregnancy , but a request to send her to a private hospital was denied " due to security measures			0
" will international pressure make any difference ? human rights groups and @entity174 governments are complaining about @entity24 's case			1
" we call upon the government of @entity2 to respect the right to freedom of religion , including one 's right to change one 's faith or beliefs , a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in @entity2 's own 2005 interim constitution , " said a statement by the embassies of the @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and the @entity181			1
@entity193 described @entity24 as a prisoner of conscience			0
" adultery and apostasy are acts which should not be considered crimes at all , let alone meet the international standard of ' most serious crimes ' in relation to the death penalty , " said @entity196 , @entity193 's @entity2 researcher			1
" it is a flagrant breach of international human rights law			0
" the case comes as the world focuses on more than 200 schoolgirls abducted by @entity5 extremists in northern @entity210 who threaten to sell them into slavery			0
whether @entity24 's case will generate the same strong reaction as the @entity210 situation remains unclear			0
in the past , a forceful international outcry has influenced similar apostasy cases			0
in 2006 , an @entity218 man threatened with the death penalty for converting to @entity131 was released into exile after @entity218 president @entity221 reportedly intervened at the behest of his @entity174 backers , over the objections of the country 's conservative judiciary .			1
