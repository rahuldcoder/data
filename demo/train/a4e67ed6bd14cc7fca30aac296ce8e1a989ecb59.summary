-- @entity3 comedy promoter @entity1 is driving through the traffic - clogged streets of @entity6 while talking to @entity0 on her cell phone , when there 's a terrifying screech of tires and the line goes dead			1
thankfully , she 's unscathed , and within minutes is once again talking about her pioneering work bringing stand - up comedy to new @entity3 audiences -- and what tickles her funny bone			1
" just going through the streets of @entity6 makes me laugh			2
the traffic here makes me laugh until dying , " she said , her near miss with a " crazy driver " dismissed as just another joke			2
later she emails to say she arrived safely at her destination			2
just as well for @entity3 's comedy fans , who will be looking to @entity27 to help deliver the follow - up to the wildly successful " hysteria " stand - up show held in @entity6 earlier this year			1
though little heard of just a few years ago , stand - up comedy is now serious business in @entity6 and other cities across the @entity34 , drawing huge crowds , according to comics in the region			1
and while western acts may have paved the way for this new enthusiasm for solo stage comics , the format has proved so popular that the region is now witnessing the rise of home - grown talent			1
" it 's a phenomenon , " said @entity46 , an @entity48 - @entity47 comic whose 2008 " @entity53 " tour of the @entity34 , featuring a cast of comedians from the region , is viewed by many as the catalyst for launching a new wave of comedy			1
@entity46 will , next month , be reprising his role as executive producer of the @entity61 , a week - long event in the @entity64 capital			1
perhaps aided by @entity64 's more relaxed laws on censorship for the region , the @entity69 festival has , in three years , grown to become the biggest event of its kind in this part of the world , said @entity46			2
but @entity64 is only the beginning , according to @entity46			2
" the festival is representative of a bigger growth , a trend			0
in @entity79 they have a thriving stand - up comedy scene with 10 or 12 comics doing regular shows			1
same thing in @entity3 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , " he said			0
though it might seem otherwise to outsiders , people in the @entity34 are no strangers to humor , with rich traditions of comic storytelling			1
veteran @entity64 comedian @entity94 has seen it all , performing in stage plays , television satire and sitcoms , but is now enjoying a new chapter in his long career thanks to stand - up			1
says @entity94 , performances were initially held in @entity103 -- with comics drawing heavily on western influences -- but local language performers are now gaining confidence			2
" now it 's taken off seriously in @entity109			0
i might be practically the only one who can do a whole evening , but there are a few young people coming up who can do five or 10 minutes here			0
" they still need experience , but people are willing to venture and make a fool of themselves in front of other people , which is new			0
" while the language might have changed , the jokes themselves touch on themes familiar to western audiences , touching on the everyday topics of relationships , traffic , pop music , @entity130 and @entity109 culture			1
" the @entity48 in the region love to laugh at themselves , that 's something we do n't see in the @entity136 media , " says @entity46			0
" if you do n't do jokes about @entity48 culture in your show , they miss it because the level of laughs for those jokes are so much higher than for generic jokes about relationships or the state of the world			2
" @entity149 , a @entity150 - @entity47 comic who has been invited to perform in @entity69 for a second time , says her routine , which sees her offer " comedy therapy " to men in the audience , works equally well in @entity64 as it does at home			1
" women all over the world are just as fed up of their husbands and tired of their bloody children as we are , " she jokes			0
but , adds @entity46 , in most @entity34 countries -- even in relatively liberal @entity64 -- there are limits			1
sex and cursing are to be avoided , as are jokes about religion and country leaders			0
" i was in @entity85 and the producer of the show said say what you want but if you make fun of [ militant group ] @entity176 you 're on your own , " he said			0
" that was an effective message			0
" that said , some are already willing to take a few risks			0
" i have been surprised by seeing some naught bits -- whether talking about farting or sex and some swear words here and there , and @entity64 take it and have a good laugh , " says @entity94 , who refuses to remove political jokes from his own show			0
" it 's different elsewhere			0
i 've performed in @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity87 where the censors would cut a lot of my script -- but then i would go ahead and do it anyway			0
" he adds : " in the @entity48 world we have so much political upheaval and so much tragedy that there is a lot of scope to turn these tragedies into comedy and laugh at them so that you can enjoy life			1

stand - up comedy has *blossomed* over past five years in @entity34
