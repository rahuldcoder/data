@entity0 -- @entity2 has been at the very heart of the @entity4 since it began 60 years ago as a way of pooling coal and steel resources -- and of preventing future wars on a continent already devastated by brutal conflicts			1
but as the region 's strongest economy , it has borne the brunt of the cost of recent rescue deals , and the country 's troubled history has meant its insistence on unity is viewed with suspicion by some of its neighbors			1
so why is @entity2 still so willing to do all it can to protect the @entity4 ? and will anything shake its faith in the euro ? why does @entity2 play such a key role in @entity28 ? @entity2 was one of the founding nations of the @entity4 , which was designed to ensure that the continent would never again be torn apart by war			1
following @entity34 , @entity2 's neighbors wanted to hobble any future attempts by the nation to remilitarize ; the @entity37 decided that the best way to do this was economically , rather than ideologically			1
" @entity37 wanted to ' tame ' @entity2 , and so the new @entity28 was built around that @entity47 - @entity46 relationship , starting from a clean slate , " said professor @entity40 , of @entity42 's department of politics and international studies " @entity2 was completely devastated after the war , and that meant it could begin again from scratch , build a new @entity2 , a new democratic nation , using economic growth as the basis for that democracy			1
" @entity28 integration became a part of that , part of the rehabilitation of @entity2 as a nation among nations			1
" how has @entity2 's economy performed over the years ? in the post-war years , @entity2 enjoyed a massive boom , as the nation made the most of the support it was offered and the opportunities that came its way to recover from the devastation of @entity34			1
" the @entity72 money coming in helped , but @entity2 's industriousness also played a big part , " said @entity40			1
" there is a very strong work ethic , and the country has a large population -- it all combined to allow @entity2 to re-emerge as a major power			1
" @entity2 flourished in the 1950s , 60s and 70s -- the period of the so - called " wirtschaftswunder " [ economic miracle ] -- while other @entity28 nations , including @entity37 and @entity85 , struggled			1
but reunification with @entity87 in 1990 following the fall of the @entity89 and the collapse of the @entity91 dented the country 's fortunes			0
" the reunification of @entity2 impoverished the country to a certain extent , " said @entity40			1
" the new @entity98 [ regions ] came in and resources had to be transferred from rich regions to poorer ones			0
" " people forget that 10 to 15 years ago , @entity2 was going through a crisis like those affecting @entity108 and @entity109 now , " said dr @entity102 , of @entity104 's department of @entity46			1
" back then , it was @entity2 that was seen as ' the sick man of @entity28			2
' the government had overspent , and had to make fundamental economic reforms -- the system was close to paralysis			0
" of course in that case -- as in the case of @entity118 , @entity119 and others -- they were able to reform at the right time , when the going was good			0
@entity109 and @entity125 have to make similar changes now , but of course there is no growth to carry their economies forward			0
" and how strong is it now ? @entity2 has long been the economic powerhouse of @entity28 , but the nation is not immune from the global financial crisis			2
it is the continent 's largest economy , but it also has a high rate of government debt , at 83.2 % of @entity140 , and higher unemployment -- at 7.1 % -- than many of its neighbors , according to 2010 figures			2
much of @entity2 's might comes from its strong manufacturing sector , which has meant that , unlike many of its neighbors , the country has not had to rely on the financial services industry or the property market , both of which have been badly hit by the global economic crisis			1
but experts warn that @entity2 , which relies heavily on trade with @entity154 , may be highly exposed to any future trouble in the @entity157 markets			2
and dr @entity159 , senior lecturer in @entity28 and international studies at @entity104 , said despite its success so far , the @entity46 economy was not bulletproof			0
" there is a lot of uncertainty out there , because the world is facing a wider recession , and in that case , who will buy @entity46 products ? " is @entity2 propping up the euro ? " the short answer to that is yes , " says @entity159			1
" if @entity2 was not there as the anchor , offering stability , and with its economic weight -- as one of the world 's most successful economies -- behind it , we would not still be talking about resolving the crisis -- it would be over already			1
" but that does n't mean @entity2 can do it alone			2
" chancellor @entity184 has insisted even those outside the eurozone must do their bit to resolve the crisis			0
what do ordinary @entity46 think of the crisis ? experts say it is inevitable that there is a degree of resentment on the part of @entity46 citizens , when faced with the responsibility of clearing up another neighbor 's mess			0
" most ordinary @entity46 are quite unhappy with having to bail out the southern @entity28 countries , they are n't happy at having to give them their money , " said @entity159			0
" but then most west @entity87 were n't happy about giving money to @entity87 after reunification either			0
" he added that while the crisis had initially hit @entity184 's popularity among voters , her approval ratings had risen in recent months			2
how do other nations view @entity2 's actions ? the eurozone crisis has provided plenty of fodder for eurosceptic media and politicians across the continent , with many press reports feeding off old tensions and rivalries			1
@entity40 said claims in @entity224 sections of the media in @entity85 and elsewhere that the country is " trying to take over @entity28 " were used by politicians to boost their standing at home , but could do real damage to international relations			0
" it is a delicate situation , because there is a real risk of inflaming old passions and resentments , " he said			0
" those knee - jerk reactions can have major impacts -- we need statespeople , not mere politicians , who can rise above it			2
" the idea that @entity46 history is repeating , that there is some plot to take over @entity28 , is ludicrous			0
" it comes down to how different countries view the @entity28 project -- whether they see it as a market , like the @entity85 , the @entity250 , the @entity251 ; or whether they see it as a grand political project to create a new political system , like the @entity87			0
" everyone is suspicious of each other , and that undermines any plan for greater integration			0
" @entity102 said @entity2 was in a @entity261 situation			2
" the @entity262 , and others , demand that @entity2 takes action , but when they do , they are accused of trying to take over -- it is the curse of power			2
" is there a danger the eurozone crisis could derail @entity2 's economy ? " @entity2 has had a ' good recession ' until now , " said @entity159			1
" it has benefited from the crisis so far , but now even @entity2 is having difficulty selling bonds			2
" the question is , at what point does the pain start for @entity2 ? it is not hitting people 's pay packets at the moment			1
" but it is inevitable that the @entity46 economy will be hit			0
there will be costs , be they the massive costs of a disorderly breakup of the eurozone and a move to some other currency , or the -- still large -- costs of the bailout			0
" there will be substantial costs , both short term and long term , to allow the peripheral countries of the eurozone to catch up , and when those come through there will be a growth of euroscepticism in @entity2			0
" why are @entity2 's leaders so committed to the euro , and how far will they go to protect it ? experts say @entity2 is committed to the euro , and prepared to go to great lengths to protect it			1
" @entity2 found it very difficult to give up the @entity308 -- it was a symbol of the country 's recovery , and giving that up to join the euro was a big sacrifice , " said @entity40			1
but there are limits to the country 's patience			0
" it depends on the behavior of the other @entity28 partners , " said @entity159			0
" @entity2 is doing as much as it can , but the other nations have to be reasonable , @entity2 ca n't help ' at any price			0
' " the other countries need to be ready and willing to address their problems , to make changes -- @entity184 ca n't keep writing blank checks if the conditions are n't being met			0
" no - one wants to pour water into a leaking bucket forever			1

@entity2 has been at the very heart of the @entity4 since it began 60 years ago
as region 's strongest economy , it has borne the brunt of the cost of recent rescue deals
@entity308 was seen as symbol of @entity2 's @entity344 recovery , move to euro a major sacrifice
@entity2 keen to protect euro , but " no - one wants to pour water into a leaking bucket forever "
