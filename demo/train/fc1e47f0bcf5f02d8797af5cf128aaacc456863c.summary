@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 takes running for @entity4 literally			1
try keeping up with her as she races through a rainy parade			0
@entity3 does n't march , she sprints -- darting side - to - side , shaking as many hands as possible -- a lieutenant colonel in the @entity13 recruiting potential voters for her campaign			2
the @entity17 veteran and little - known conservative @entity1 state senator burst onto the political scene earlier this year with the tv ad of the political primary season			1
smiling straight to camera , @entity3 says in the ad that she knows how to cut pork because she grew up on a farm castrating pigs			1
the squealing pigs in the background became a trademark of her campaign			0
she decisively beat three @entity33 primary opponents with the support of a broad coalition of @entity33 groups -- rare in these divided times for the @entity33			2
still , @entity3 's conservative views , combined with her interesting personal story and boundless energy , have made her one of this election @entity46 most high - profile @entity43 favorites			1
the problem for @entity3 is that while @entity1 has its share of conservatives who vote in @entity33 primaries , and of course its first in the nation presidential caucuses every four years , it is actually a relatively moderate state			1
and @entity3 is running for an open @entity4 seat being vacated by @entity57 @entity56 , a venerable liberal in the state and nationwide			1
with a new @entity2 / @entity61 poll showing just a 1 - point difference between @entity3 and @entity64 opponent @entity63 , well within the margin of error , it 's no surprise that @entity3 is trying to moderate her image			1
when we asked whether she wanted to be a senator in the mold of @entity73 , the freshman conservative firebrand from @entity75 , without missing a beat she replied , " oh , no. " " i 'm a senator in the mold of @entity3 , just an independent leader who will represent @entity1 , " @entity3 told @entity2			1
@entity3 says she was harassed in the military make issues the issue democrats working to elect @entity63 believe best the way to beat @entity3 and keep this seat in @entity64 hands is to steer the conversation away from her persona and toward her position on issues , which @entity64 argue fall well out of the mainstream of @entity1 voters			1
" @entity3 and the people supporting her do n't seem to want to engage and talk about where she stands on the issues , " @entity63 said			1
with primary over , @entity4 race gets ugly @entity3 did answer some of our questions about those issues			1
that includes when she was a state senator and co-sponsored personhood legislation , which would legally mean life begins at conception			0
it 's a position some self - described pro-life voters do not support , but @entity3 stands by it			2
" i promote a culture of life			0
that 's the person i am , " @entity3 told us			2
one of the practical results of the personhood measure -- life starts at conception -- is that it would likely outlaw some forms of birth control			0
she tried to distance herself from that notion , telling us , " @entity125 , no. " " i am someone who supports a woman 's right to birth control , absolutely , so to say that is absolutely false and misleading , " she said			0
" so , if women would like to talk to me about those items , i am happy to talk it over			0
birth control yes , and promoting a culture of life , yes			0
" on pocketbook issues , @entity3 opposes a nationwide , federal minimum wage , which @entity63 's campaign thinks is so harmful politically to her that it 's running ads and talking about it nonstop			1
she explained to us that she does n't believe minimum wage should be a " one size fits all approach , " but rather state by state			0
" we really do need to have a minimum wage that is set based on local economies			0
and i think the state is best to do that , " @entity3 said			1
she said she believes the current minimum wage , $ 7.25 per hour , is " appropriate for @entity1 , but that 's up for our state legislators to decide , and i 'm willing to have those discussions at the state level			2
" when we pointed out that a lot of families live on minimum wage , she replied , " it 's a beginning wage , it should n't be the wage they survive on forever			0
" ernst : savvy , rebellious or both ? @entity3 is the beneficiary of millions of dollars from outside groups funded by the @entity171 brothers and other big national donors			2
she has no shortage of strategic help from @entity33 operatives on a national level , hoping this will be one of the six seats @entity33 need to win the @entity4			1
but she does n't always take the advice she gets			0
on our three - hour drive from @entity184 to @entity0 , we got a call from one of her operatives informing us that our scheduled brief interview was canceled			0
" no more national interviews for a while , " was what we were told			0
but when we arrived and approached @entity3 , instead of avoiding us , she greeted us warmly and answered several questions along the parade route			2
whether that was savvy ( avoiding unflattering pictures of her running away ) or rebellion against @entity202 advisers , it was a telling level of sophistication for a first - time statewide candidate in a high - profile race			2
@entity63 working to repair his image as for her @entity64 opponent , he , too , has a comfort level and natural rapport with voters -- characteristics that fly in the face of the unfortunate image of an out - of - touch @entity202 insider he helped inflict on himself with a series of early gaffes			1
the congressman complained about no towel service in the @entity222 gym during the government shutdown			0
and @entity63 was caught on tape disparaging @entity1 's popular senior @entity33 sen. @entity225 and farmers -- a big @entity1 no - no -- by calling @entity225 a " farmer from @entity1 who never went to law school			1
" while walking with us through the quiet streets of his hometown of @entity233 , @entity1 , @entity63 owned those mistakes without being defensive			1
" all of us say things that we regret			0
and if you grow up in @entity1 , the important lesson to learn is that if you make a mistake , you take responsibility for it , and that 's what i did , " he told @entity2			2
first lady to campaign for @entity57 in tight @entity4 race he brought us to this small @entity1 town where his mother still teaches school at 85 and he started a paper route in third grade , facts that @entity63 hopes can beat back a narrative that @entity33 seized on after his rhetorical stumbles : that he 's a @entity202 creature now who ca n't relate to @entity255			1
" i 've baled hay , i 've worked farms , i was a truck driver , a construction worker			0
i was a janitor in this town			0
i learned the value of hard work from the people i grew up here with , " @entity63 said			2
" they taught me that it 's important to respect other people , to be a good listener , and to work hard and fight for people who do n't have an ability to be their own voice			0
and that 's what i 've done in the @entity222 and that 's what type of senator i 'd be , " he told us			0
while @entity1 is n't conservative , is certainly is n't ultraliberal			2
@entity56 , feted by the @entity276 at his final famous steak fry over the weekend , is a unique public figure in the state -- quite popular statewide despite his openly liberal leanings			0
still , @entity63 told us he would be " a progressive problem solver in the mold of @entity56			2
" congressman apologizes for # @entity286 tweet gender gap , even with a @entity33 woman on ballot if @entity3 , a 44 - year - old mother and stepgrandmother , were to win this seat , she would be the first woman senator from @entity1			1
but the new @entity2 / @entity61 poll shows that 57 % of women voters in @entity1 support her male , @entity64 opponent			1
the traditional gender gap between the parties still exists here , even with a @entity33 woman on the ballot			2
we only had a chance to ask @entity3 one quick question about gender along the parade route here -- why she thinks so few of the 20 women @entity309 senators are @entity33 ? ( there are four @entity33 female senators )			1
" that 'd is a really good question			0
you need to ask the voters in all those other states , " she said abruptly before racing off to shake more hands of potential voters			0
finally , a @entity57 who wants @entity320 to come like many democrats on the ballot this year , @entity63 is weighed down by an unpopular president , whose approval rating here now stands at just 37 %			2
that 's remarkable , considering that @entity1 is where @entity320 's big 2008 caucuses win knocked @entity328 off her @entity222 path -- and where @entity320 beat @entity33 rivals in 2008 and 2012			1
if @entity33 take control of the @entity4 for @entity320 's last two years in office , it would likely sting even more if @entity1 elected a @entity33 and helped deliver that blow to the president			1
still , while @entity64 candidates in red states keep their distance , @entity63 does not			1
" if the president has time in his schedule to come to @entity1 in this campaign , i 'd welcome him , " he said			0
" @entity255 are the type of people who welcome somebody of significant importance , and that would certainly include president @entity320			0
even though they may disagree with him , every four years we welcome people of both parties to come and talk about important policy issues , and i think that would be one of the reasons why it would be alright for president @entity320 to come to @entity1 , " @entity63 explained			1
" come on , president @entity320 ! " that was @entity3 's reaction when we about her opponent 's willingness to host the unpopular @entity64 president on the campaign trail here			1
" i think that would be wonderful , " @entity3 told us , barely hiding a mischievous smile			0
in @entity1 , @entity364 confront @entity365 @entity367 @entity366 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 @entity33 @entity4 candidate @entity3 raised her profile with pig castration ad
@entity64 opponent @entity63 stumbled into " out of touch with @entity1 " tag
in the moderate state , @entity3 might lean too far to the right , @entity63 too far to the left
