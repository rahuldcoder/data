in a letter from earlier this month that @entity8 shared with @entity0 , an administrator at @entity19 noted that he 'd been told of @entity8 's same - sex marriage and saw pictures of it posted to @entity23			1

" as an @entity30 and a @entity31 , i do respect your choice , " the administrator wrote			0
" ( but ) i have to uphold the @entity34 at @entity19 and confront you with our position			1
" due to this recent event , you will not be able to attend @entity19 in the future			1
" when asked to confirm that the school -- which describes itself as part of the " @entity44 " denomination -- sent the letter and to elaborate on the decision , the school 's provost , @entity39 , said only that federal law " prohibits us from confirming if an individual is or has been a student at our institution			1
" @entity39 added , " we therefore can not comment on your specific request			0
" did @entity8 sign the school 's morality covenant ? yes , she concedes			1
but she still thinks her expulsion is unfair			2

the latter value includes " building a @entity92 - centered community , " " honoring our @entity44 heritage " and " respecting diversity and various @entity31 backgrounds			0
" @entity8 came to the school on scholarship for basketball , though her playing career was cut short after doctors told her -- after she 'd suffered multiple concussions -- that she should avoid sports with physical contact			1
" i stayed on without a scholarship , " @entity8 said , " because i was so invested in the university and knew that some credits would n't transfer to other schools			1
" meanwhile , her life was changing in other ways as well			0
about 3Â½ years ago , she met her future spouse , @entity113			0
they started out as friends , and romance blossomed over time			0
