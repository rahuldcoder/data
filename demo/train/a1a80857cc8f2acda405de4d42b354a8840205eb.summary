@entity0 , @entity1 -- the hot @entity4 sun is turning cool and big and a deep soft orange , and the impala are getting mighty jumpy			1
a half - kilometer across the grassy bush , we 're watching a pack of eight @entity4 wild dogs , downwind and sniffing a scent , planning their evening hunt			1
we have a plan , too			1
we 're going to follow them			2
not far away , a large herd of zebra also knows this is the most dangerous time			2
they 've pastured all day in a broad , open field , nibbling vegetation			1
as long as these prey remain in an open area , they are safe , because they can see the predators coming			2
they can outrun all but the cheetah , and in a large group , the likelihood of any particular individual being caught is lessened			2
a herd of wildebeest is mingling with the zebra and following them through the tall grass			2
" the zebra and the wildebeest , they are friends , " our guide , 46 - year old , bush - born @entity37 of @entity38 , tells me			1
" the zebra have short necks , but the wildebeest , they have long necks			2
so the zebras ' heads are high and they can see above the grass and they tramp it down low enough so the wildebeest , whose heads are low , can see too			2
" if you go : visiting the @entity0 it 's like the baboons and the impala , @entity37 explains			1
earlier , we watched impala graze near a family of baboons , with one baboon sitting on a stump , keeping watch for lion , cheetah and leopard			2
if the baboon detects danger , the impala will know , too			2
but now the night approaches , and the darkness will neutralize the prey 's advantage			2
they must head for the shrubs and trees to hide			2
but they know that is where the predators sit in wait			2
this just might be their time to die			2
we have come here to @entity87 , a 170,000 - hectare private reserve deep in the world 's largest inland delta , @entity1 's famed @entity0			1
thousands of tourists visit the delta every year , willing to put up with inconvenience and discomfort and considerable expense , to witness nature work its astonishing wiles			1
every darkening evening , for millennia now , a great game has been afoot here			1
in the @entity100 's autumn months of march through june , the delta floods with water from @entity104 's highlands , inundating 1.5 million hectares of flat land and attracting one of the world 's greatest concentrations of wildlife			2
safari experts on ' trip of a lifetime ' many of the animals , the vegetarians such as impala , elephant , giraffe , zebra and hippopotamus , come for the rich grasses and trees			2
the carnivores come for them			2
so tonight we are watching the dogs from a short distance			1
we whisper to each other in our open - air , @entity130 - style vehicle that seems able to drive through anything			1
@entity37 is at the wheel and his tracker , @entity134 , is perched on a mounted seat above a front headlight			2
this is a rare moment , and even @entity37 , who was born in the @entity138 , is thrilled to see the dogs			1
african wild dogs , also called @entity142 hunting dogs , are officially endangered			1
conservationists say shrinking habitat and farmers , hunters and rangers who poison and shoot them to protect livestock are eroding their number			2
the dogs roam small swaths of forest , desert and savanna in southern @entity4			1
they hunt whatever they can catch : antelope , small wildebeest , warthogs , rodents and even birds			2
tonight , they are after impala			2
suddenly , they are on the move , first as an unorganized group , then in a line , first walking , now trotting			2
we have n't seen the impala , but @entity37 knows the dogs have their scent			1
" the impala are that way ( he points to the right ) , but the dogs will go that way , then up there ( he points to about 11 o'clock ) , they will turn right			1
they always follow the line of the bush			0
" he turns his outstretched arm to 2 o'clock			0
" we need to be there to see the chase			0
" " how do you know that ? " i ask incredulously			0
" these are dogs , " he says			1
" i know these dogs			1
i have seen dogs before			1
" the dogs pick up the pace			1
we start bushwhack - driving toward 2 o'clock , pacing the dogs along the track			1
we reach a point , and now see the impala through the bush to the right , maybe 600 meters off			0
the dogs slow , they turn to the right and accelerating , leap into the bushes just behind us			1
we have a difficult time seeing them , but @entity37 knows where they are heading and we turn right , directly toward the impala along the outside of the bushes that are giving the dogs cover			1
suddenly we see a dog through the bushes , then another , then another			0
they are making their move			0
we accelerate , blasting and bouncing through the uneven grass			0
the impala are on high alert , watching the bush , watching us , perceiving a threat but not yet knowing what it is			0
suddenly , the dogs streak out of the bush straight for the impala , and the chase is on			1
on level , unobstructed ground , @entity37 explains as we dash in pursuit , a dog can catch an impala			0
an impala 's high step can kick up dirt , and if it can gain ground , the flying dirt will confuse the dog 's scent			0
but there they are ! from behind a bush , an impala flies in full sprint , and at most two seconds behind , the dogs are ripping after it like a stiff evening wind			1
the speed and focus of the predator and the prey are razor - sharp			0
we race along on a parallel track			0
the dogs are going to get him , i 'm sure of it			1
@entity37 is n't so certain			0
" @entity265 , mayyybe , " he says			0
what i have yet to learn is that the impala is n't just running from something , it 's running toward something			0
this is n't a chase			0
i begin to understand the great game being played			1
the predators here are the best in the business , but the prey are thinkers , too			0
it 's a balancing game for both			1
natural selection has left the prey with innate understandings about how to survive in a predator - driven world			0
those that do n't know , die			0
for the predators , those that understand and counter , eat			0
those that do n't , die			0
" it is a great balance , " @entity37 explains			1
" it is great drama every day			1
the impala , they know things the dogs do not know			1
it is the same with the zebra			0
they know the herd protects them , and they watch out for each other			0
the lions , they know they must sneak up quietly , and get as close as they can and surprise the zebra , or pounce on the zebra when the zebra tries to get through the bush			0
" each one reacts and counter-reacts to the other			0
it is not easy to win			0
but once now , one does			0
once later , the other one does			0
it is not so uneven			0
it is the way they live			0
" and this time , the impala will win , because it knows , just ahead , there is a small lake , and it knows dogs can not run fast through water			1
the dogs are close on the impala 's heels , but it reaches the pond maybe one second ahead , charges in , and the dogs stop at the shore			1
they know following is pointless , and besides , there are hippopotamus in the lake , and that is a danger			0
the dogs do n't look happy			1
in fact , they look stunned			0
later , from far off , we see the dogs again in ravenous pursuit of several other impala			1
the race is on again			0
we scream over the bumpy grass , trying to catch up , but the pack loses us			0
@entity37 explains that this time , the dogs will eat			1
there is no water around , and it is the dog 's last chance before darkness			0
the impala will not escape			0
every evening it is like this , every year , forever			1
if one makes the journey here , the great game is easy to see			1
it plays out under the darkening @entity4 sky			1
over time , the prey get better at escaping , because the ones that do n't , die and do n't reproduce			0
the predators get better too , because the ones that do n't adapt to the prey 's improving skills also die off			0
it 's natural selection : all the species improve by hunting or fleeing from each other			0
on the way back to camp , tracker @entity134 catches a hyena in his spotlight			0
it is heading toward where the dogs last chased the impala			1
it will see if the dogs left anything for it to eat , @entity37 explains			1
maybe the hyena will try to chase the dogs from their catch			1
maybe it will win tonight			0

a rare *sighting* of @entity4 wild dogs leads to an exciting game drive
thousands of tourists visit the @entity0 each year to see survival in action
" it is a great balance , " a guide said . " it is great drama every day "
