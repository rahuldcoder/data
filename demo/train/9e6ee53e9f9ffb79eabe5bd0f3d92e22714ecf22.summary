@entity0 -- suddenly , after years of the @entity3 advancing toward the end zone of equality in its hiring practices , diversity has been smacked for a sack and a fumble			1
let 's get the brutal numbers out of the way , and then i 'll move to the contradiction to everything i just said , which is the brilliant career of @entity15			2
i mean , among the recent vacancies in the @entity3 , where 70 % of the players are black , there were eight openings for head coaches and seven for general managers			1
none were filled by minorities			2
how strange , because this is a 93 - year - old league whose most impressive guy at running a franchise these days is darker than @entity28 of the past and @entity30 of the present			0
photos : @entity33 by the numbers i 'm referring to @entity15 , 56 , who harkens of the future , because he has a tendency to stay a few paces ahead of his @entity3 peers			1
they call @entity15 " @entity41 " for his ability to keep the @entity43 vibrant throughout his decade as the @entity3 's first black general manager			1
in fact , this @entity47 tight end - turned expert talent evaluator has replaced the @entity50 bath after huge victories as the rage around the league			0
" it 's part of the dream , that dream , " @entity15 told reporters at the @entity43 ' headquarters last week when describing his @entity3 success			1
" i do n't know if i 'll have to pinch myself to see if i 'm still dreaming			0
" no , @entity15 's @entity3 legacy is real , alright			1
just ask @entity61 , who joins @entity15 among the league 's highest - ranking black executives as the director of player personnel for the @entity66			1
@entity61 began scouting with @entity15 in the @entity68 organization in the early 1990s , when @entity30 was running the show before his prolific stint with the @entity71			2
later , @entity15 was @entity61 's boss in @entity43 from 2005 to 2007			1
5 story lines to follow at the @entity33 " @entity15 understands people maybe better than anybody i 've ever met , " @entity61 said			0
" those draft picks he makes ( through the annual @entity3 draft ) are people , and he just knows how to deal with them			0
those guys play for him , because those guys can be themselves around him			0
" whether you 're a player or a scout or anybody else in the @entity43 organization , @entity15 wants you to be you , and he lets you be you			1
under @entity15 , the @entity43 have reached the playoffs seven times ( including the last five seasons ) , and they 've made three trips to the @entity88 title game			1
more impressive , despite a defense with more aches and pains than anybody in the league , the @entity43 used several of @entity15 's shrewd picks through the years to reach the @entity33 on sunday at the @entity95 against the @entity96			1
the @entity43 operate with @entity15 's fingerprints wrapped around everything they do			1
the coaching : @entity15 hired @entity101 five years ago , and this was despite @entity101 lacking head coaching experience by serving mostly as an @entity3 special teams and secondary coach			1
the result ? @entity101 has won 67 % of his games with the @entity43			2
the quarterback : @entity15 ignored the fact that @entity110 was considered an inaccurate gunslinger for the obscure @entity112 of the @entity113			0
he made @entity110 the 18th pick overall of the 2008 draft			0
since then , @entity110 has an 8 - 4 record in the playoffs , including an @entity3 - record six postseason victories on the road			2
join our @entity33 hangout the others : @entity15 is noted for seeing things that nobody else does when studying players in the draft or free agency			2
his picks regularly are enlightened ( see the @entity43 ' multiple trips to the playoffs )			2
most recently , there was @entity15 taking a chance on 400 - something pounds of @entity133 , who was considered a bust by many			0
he was gifted but unmotivated			0
the @entity136 of general managers spent his interview time with @entity133 at the 2010 @entity3 scouting combine calling the nose tackle everything shy of a fat slob			2
@entity133 now is so slim ( well , relatively speaking at 350 pounds ) that he is considered a future star for the @entity43			0
then there is outside linebacker @entity145 , the @entity43 ' late second - round pick out of @entity147 in the 2009 @entity3 draft			1
he played little during his first three seasons			0
then along came those @entity43 injuries on defense , and @entity145 showcased all of that hidden depth acquired by @entity15 when he finished this season with nine sacks and 42 tackles			1
no wonder @entity15 is revered so much by @entity158 of the @entity159 , @entity160 of the @entity161 , @entity162 of the @entity163 and @entity164 of the @entity165			0
that quartet represents the only other black general managers among the @entity3 's 32 teams			1
game day predictions " i tell those guys -- along with others -- to call @entity15 to walk you through the drill over how things should be done , " said @entity170 , 76 , a respected black @entity3 player personnel director of yore for the @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity43 before he became the long - time chairman of the @entity175			1
among other things , @entity181 's group worked in conjunction with @entity3 officials in 2003 to form the @entity175 , which is named after @entity186 chairman @entity185			2
according to the rule , all @entity3 teams must interview at least one minority candidate before hiring a head coach or a general manager			1
the idea is to increase the number of minority head coaches and general managers around the league			0
" these are the lowest head coach diversity numbers the league has seen since 2003 , when the @entity175 was just implemented , " wrote @entity197 , the @entity175 's executive director , in a letter to @entity3 officials regarding the drop from six to four black head coaches in the league after this past regular season			1
" similarly , no minority front office candidate was selected for any of the vacant @entity205 positions			0
" so the @entity175 want the @entity175 expanded to include openings for offensive and defensive coordinators			0
many of the @entity3 's future team leaders come from those positions			1
there currently are six black defensive coordinators in the league and just two black offensive coordinators			0
the non-fan 's guide to @entity33 parties the @entity3 knows there are issues along these lines			2
last month , league executive vice president of human resources @entity221 said , " while there has been full compliance with the interview requirements of the @entity175 and we wish the new head coaches and general managers much success , the hiring results this year have been unexpected and reflect a disappointing lack of diversity			0
@entity15 weighed in this week telling the @entity232 " is the opportunity there ( for minorities ) ? yes , it is			2
you can look at the fact that i am the third of the gms that have been there ( @entity33 )			0
( @entity243 general manager ) @entity244 had a chance to go with @entity246			1
( @entity161 general manager ) @entity160 has been to two			1
" we 've had @entity250 coaches have the opportunity			0
i 've had conversations among the diversity working group committee myself			0
are we going to work to get better ? yes , but all we can do is to put people in front of people			0
" beyond the quotes , @entity15 speaks loudest through his actions as the epitome of what could be for an @entity3 franchise looking for success			1
that is , if other blacks are given a chance in team decision - making roles			0
" i think @entity15 is an incredible role model for anybody within an organization with the desire to be a general manager , and , honestly , that 's true whether you 're talking about an @entity250 or a @entity274 , " said @entity267 , the @entity66 ' general manager			1
@entity267 's late father , @entity275 , was a prominent scout for the @entity68 down the stretch of @entity15 's @entity278 playing career that ended after the 1990 season			2
the older @entity267 also was around for @entity15 's opening five years in the @entity68 ' scouting department			2
that was before @entity15 continued as an @entity3 boss in 1996 when that particular @entity68 ' franchise ( there is another one now ) moved to @entity43 to become the @entity43			1
said @entity267 , " my dad -- as an older school , tough football guy -- was very complimentary of how @entity15 handled that transition from player to team executive			0
he handled it with tact and with respect to the other football people who were there before him			0
he did n't just thump his chest to say he had arrived , because he was such a great player			0
" @entity15 still does n't thump his chest -- you know , even though he is a great general manager			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity300 .			0

70 % of @entity3 players are black but no recent head coach or @entity205 spots were filled by minorities
@entity43 gm @entity15 is the @entity3 's first black general manager
@entity15 has been the @entity43 ' general manager since 2002
under @entity15 , the @entity43 have reached the playoffs seven times
