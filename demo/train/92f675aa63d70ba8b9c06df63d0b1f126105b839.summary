-- he is the heir apparent to @entity2 , on the course and off it			1
by the end of monday , @entity5 's bank balance will take a step closer to matching that of the most marketable star the sport has ever seen			2
a bumper multi-year deal with @entity13 , reported by various media outlets to be worth over $ 200 million , will propel the @entity15 into a stratosphere inhabited only by the richest men and women in sport			1
though @entity5 may only have two major championships to his name compared to @entity2 ' 14 , at 23 he has time on his side as he strives to eclipse the achievements of his new stable mate			1
and while @entity2 has n't been able to recapture the form he showed prior to news of his extra-marital affairs breaking , @entity13 's courting of @entity5 is an attempt to pin down a star of the present and future who comes with less baggage , according to a sports business expert			1
" @entity13 is in a difficult position , " @entity36 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity38 told @entity0 , " because their number one golf property historically has fallen on hard times , relatively speaking			2
" when @entity2 crashed his car into a fire hydrant in 2009 , @entity44 of @entity13 described it as a minor blip			1
commercially that 's quite interesting because i think they genuinely believed there was still some sustainability and financial value in the @entity2 brand heading into the future			2
but that just has n't transpired			0
" @entity2 has n't won a major since then and his public reputation has n't recovered to where it was			0
that 's a problem for @entity13 because what you 've got to keep in mind is that @entity13 essentially built their whole golf business on the back of @entity2 and for a long time the vast majority of their commercial activity and their marketing was based around him			1
and it was very successful			0
" they used not to have a significant golf business but now they do			0
the problem is that to a large extent , they 've been left high and dry			0
they now have a global golf business without a credible brand spokesperson			0
" so essentially what they 've been looking for is an heir apparent , somebody with the same competitive characteristics as @entity2 but without the baggage , as well as somebody who can conceivably carry the brand into the future			1
that 's why i think the length of the deal is absolutely crucial			0
" it seems to me that what they 're attempting to do is to build a sustainable business on the back of @entity5 over the next 10 years , just as they did with @entity2 over the first 13 years of their time together			2
" at a stroke , the deal transforms @entity5 into one of the hottest commercial properties in sport			2
according to the @entity107 list of 2012 , @entity5 's deal with @entity13 will make him highest paid young sports star in the world , taking him well above the $ 17.4 million he earned in the year up to july 2012			1
but he still has some way to go to catch @entity2 , who raked in total earnings of $ 59.4 million in the same time period			0
both trail behind the world 's top two highest grossing sports stars , boxers @entity117 and @entity118 , who earned $ 85 million and $ 62 million respectively			1
while @entity13 's outlay on @entity2 and @entity5 is significant , it will seem like money well spent should their twin titans end up battling it out going down the stretch at many a major tournament in the years to come			1
but with both of golf 's biggest stars now operating under the same umbrella , even if they do n't end up slugging it out for honors on the course , the prospect of both players being available for marketing opportunities is a big draw for @entity13 , according to @entity136 , a sport , event and project management consultant at @entity140 in @entity141			1
@entity142 : which @entity13 star will rory mirror ? " in many respects this is a coup for @entity13 as they now have some leverage on the two of the most marketable figures in the world of sport , " he told @entity0			2
" @entity153 fans everywhere are longing for the head to head battles between these two , given their considerable differences in age , style and personalities			0
" @entity13 will certainly use their leverage to nurture such competition by ensuring their schedules are aligned to foster maximum exposure to such opportunities			0
when this begins to happen consistently , and i believe it will soon , @entity13 reaps the unbelievable rewards			2
" this deal is not taken lightly and i am sure all of @entity13 's significant market research is verifying a likeability scale for this young man ( @entity5 ) that is off the charts			1
" just as @entity13 will hope @entity5 can match @entity2 ' prowess when it comes to bagging majors and green jackets , they could be forgiven for hoping the 23 - year - old wo n't attract any salacious headlines away from the greens			1
the sports giant recently dropped disgraced cyclist @entity184 after he was stripped of his seven @entity186 titles for doping offenses , and withstood a barrage of bad press for their client when news of @entity2 ' extra marital affairs broke			0
@entity5 's only negative press to date has come via the odd misjudged quote -- which can be explained as a byproduct of his youthful exuberance and refreshing honesty in interviews -- and though he has earned plaudits for keeping his feet on the ground , @entity136 says there is no guarantee how he 'll react if he reaches the level of fame woods currently orbits			0
" @entity5 represents a much different personality than @entity2 and on the surface , epitomizes a safe investment for @entity13 , " he said			1
" however like @entity2 , he appears to be a marketer 's dream			0
the problem is , no one truly knows how any individual is going to react to all this money , fame and adoration until they have lived with it			0
" these superstar athletes live in a fish bowl where their every comment , action and especially reactions are fodder for the media outlets around the world			0
already , controversy is circling with regard to @entity5 's @entity230 participation decision and legal issues with previous sponsors			0
" the first time the world will see @entity13 's new double act in action will be on thursday when @entity5 and @entity2 line up for the @entity236 in @entity237 .			1
