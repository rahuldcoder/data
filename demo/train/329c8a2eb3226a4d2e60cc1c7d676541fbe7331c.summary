-- world heavyweight champion @entity1 has told reporters that he believes rival @entity3 is only bluffing with his threats to quit boxing in october			1
@entity7 ( @entity7 ) and @entity6 ( @entity6 ) champion @entity1 will defend his titles against @entity9 on april 30 , prompting @entity10 ( @entity10 ) champion @entity3 to announce that the unification fight between the duo will now not happen because he intends to retire when he turns 31 later this year			1
but @entity14 has poured scorn on @entity3 's claims , saying : " this is total nonsense and he is playing the media			1
" he will not retire because he is a liar			0
he has no legacy whatsoever from boxing -- beating @entity21 has not given him a legacy			0
" @entity3 has accomplished nothing in the heavyweight division other than to present himself with his stupid t - shirt and comments , " @entity1 continued			2
" this guy will eventually fight me because everything coming out of his mouth is a lie , but if he does retire , he will be a loser with no legacy in the heavyweight division at all			0
" @entity3 made the comments after @entity1 chose to honor an agreement to face the @entity35 's compatriot @entity9 , in a fight that was postponed from last year after @entity1 suffered a back injury in training			1
however , @entity1 maintains that if he beats @entity9 , he can still fight @entity3 later in the year			1
the @entity39 added : " i do n't need a half a year to prepare for @entity3			0
me facing @entity9 first is good promotion for the fight because the guy is also @entity44 and also very loud			2
" @entity3 could be forced to fight mandatory @entity10 challenger and former world champion @entity46 , with a preliminary date set for july 2 , although @entity48 maintains that could be side - stepped			2
" i do n't take @entity3 as a super-special fight			0
i 'm always in shape anyway			0
he could give @entity46 step - aside money and then i 'm going to be there with nobody to fight , " continued @entity1			0
" because of our history before , i would fight him on july 2 and we would work on the contract , but i would still fight @entity9 first			1

@entity1 believes @entity3 is only bluffing with his threats to quit boxing
@entity62 maintains he will retire in october without facing @entity14
