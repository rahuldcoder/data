-- after becoming the first team to defend the @entity3 , adding a second continental title to the @entity5 won in 2010 , many observers have been quick to label @entity6 the greatest team in the history of international football			1
an emphatic 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity11 , the biggest margin of victory ever seen in a world or @entity16 final , continued a remarkable run which has seen @entity6 not concede a goal in a knockout match since the great @entity20 found the back of their net for @entity24 at the 2006 @entity5			1
comparisons are now being drawn with teams like the @entity28 - inspired @entity27 of the 1970 @entity5 , which won six games at the tournament to become three - time world champions -- averaging 3.2 goals per game			1
so how do @entity6 , led by the " illustrious " @entity34 and built around the @entity36 - bred midfield axis of @entity37 and @entity38 , stack up against the " selecao " of 42 years ago , which featured icons like @entity28 , @entity41 and @entity42 ? " a team who win back - to - back @entity16 titles , and a @entity5 in the middle , have a very strong claim to being the best ever , " said @entity45 contributor and @entity46 football journalist @entity43			1
" my pinch of salt would be the @entity27 1970 side , how many chances would they have had to play big tournaments ? the @entity58 ( now the @entity59 ) was always poorly organized			1
" @entity6 's recent domination of international football has been underlined by goalkeeper and captain @entity63 , who , after sunday 's final in @entity65 , became the first player to record 100 wins in international football -- accumulated over 137 matches			1
blog : @entity6 make compelling case as best team ever the @entity75 goalkeeper 's importance to his country was apparent as @entity6 conceded just one goal en route to retaining their @entity16 crown -- @entity81 's strike for @entity11 when the two teams drew 1 - 1 in their opening group c match			1
in contrast @entity85 's samba stars shipped seven goals in just six games in @entity89 in 1970			1
" @entity6 have arguably one of the best goalkeepers to grace this world , " said @entity43			1
" @entity63 is unbelievably good			0
he 's so good people now presume @entity6 has always produced good goalkeepers			1
" until the mid- 1980s , @entity27 were known for producing dodgy goalkeepers			2
@entity96 , the goalkeeper in 1970 , was bad			0
even by the standards of @entity46 , people used to say he was n't the right guy			0
" but the success of @entity85 's team was not built on defense			2
instead it was made possible through an irrepressible attack which , in powerful forward @entity41 , boasted one of only three players to have scored in every match of a @entity5 tournament			1
@entity41 's goals , combined with the four scored by @entity28 and three from @entity110 , helped @entity27 amass 19 in six @entity5 matches , beating reigning champions @entity112 along the way			1
" @entity41 is a hero , " said @entity43			2
" he is like the typical striker every @entity16 team would love to have			0
that guy was like a bulldozer			0
" they had @entity28 , in his swansong after two very mediocre @entity120 in 1962 and 1966			0
they were a machine , a very efficient team			0
" they could play the ball , they could do a lot of trickery			0
but on the other hand , they appealed to the @entity16 because of the lack of ' samba ' or dribbling			0
they were pretty much a @entity16 team			0
" @entity43 also points to the physical prowess of @entity85 's 11 , who helped shatter traditional preconceptions regarding the strength and fitness of @entity140 players -- culminating in a thumping 4 - 1 win over @entity11 in the 1970 final			2
" @entity27 showed up in @entity144 with a bunch of horses , " explained @entity43			2
" clearly they could play , but they were also fit			0
" @entity11 beat @entity149 in the semifinal and arrived in the final against @entity27 tired , they were steamrollered by the @entity46			2
every second half in that competition , @entity27 murdered everybody else			2
" the lasting appeal of this @entity27 team , @entity43 believes , is also linked to technology which allowed the 1970 @entity5 to be beamed around the globe in color -- allowing viewers a first glimpse of the iconic yellow shirt			1
" it was the first global @entity5			2
people sat in front of the television and watched it properly			0
" no one remembers 1962 and outside of @entity16 people do n't really remember 1966			0
it was a @entity5 where tv technology was pretty much together			2
it was easier for people to see it			0
" @entity38 ' symbolized @entity171 success ' taking into account all of the statistics , considering @entity6 's domineering tiki taka possession - based style and @entity27 's " jogo bonito , " which team will history remember as the better ? " i would love to see them play against each other , " said @entity43			1
" as a dynasty , @entity6 now are better			2
that @entity46 team was nothing like the team of four years earlier			0
the @entity185 team has been largely the same since 2008			0
" head - to - head , i think some differences have to be observed			0
@entity6 does n't have a @entity28 , they certainly do n't have a @entity189 ( the captain who scored the iconic fourth goal in the 1970 final -- widely regarded as the finest in history )			1
" the next @entity5 will be hosted by @entity27 , bringing back memories of when the @entity140 held the tournament in 1950 , missing out on a first world crown by losing in the final match to @entity198			1
" the pressure of playing at home will be horrendous , " explained @entity43			0
" even in a meaningless match , if @entity27 do n't score in the first five minutes the crowd start booing			1
blog : are @entity6 boring ? " @entity140 champions @entity205 played @entity36 ( of @entity6 ) in the @entity207 final last year , and that 's one of the things which has @entity27 scared			1
" @entity205 were trounced and that sent shockwaves around @entity27			2
these guys were the basis of the @entity185 team , and they just made fools of the best team in @entity140			0
" so is there any hope of @entity27 lifting the @entity5 trophy for a sixth time at a rebuilt @entity222 stadium in two years ' time ? " they have some very decent players emerging			1
striker @entity227 is a genius , you have players like attacking midfielder @entity230 and playmaker @entity231 , " @entity43 said			0
" i am sure they will have a very good team in 2014			0
if you asked me right now , ' will @entity27 win the @entity5 ? ' my answer is no. can @entity27 win it ? yes , if things change			1
