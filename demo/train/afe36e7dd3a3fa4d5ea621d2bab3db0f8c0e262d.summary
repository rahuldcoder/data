-- @entity2 officials are asking fishermen to help save birds caught in nets after thousands of dead fowl appeared along coastal @entity2 this week			1
at least 2,300 dead birds were found along beaches between @entity9 and @entity12 de @entity10 , @entity2 , said @entity13 , and environment professor and director of the @entity16 , @entity2			1
many of the birds , which come from several species , had broken wings and bruising on the outside of their bodies -- injuries consistent with getting trapped in fishing nets , @entity13 said			1
he said bird deaths from fishing nets occur every year , but never at this level			1
in a typical year , about 15 to 20 dead birds are found , @entity13 said			0
one hypothesis for the increase this year involves climate			0
as @entity2 weather gets colder this time of year , migrating birds that would normally travel north for warmth are instead lingering to feast on an influx of anchovies and sardines that had fled the coast of @entity39 in search of cooler waters			1
earlier this week , @entity39 authorities say warm waters off that country 's coast are to blame for the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds			1
the @entity48 for the @entity49 said that since february , the @entity39 coast has had an abundance of warm water as a result of marine currents throughout the world 's oceans			2
the warm water has altered the marine ecosystem , it said			0
the warm water has led fish such as anchovies and other species that live in surface waters to migrate to deeper water toward the south			1
as a result , pelicans and other birds that feed from the surface of the water died of starvation			0
" if these oceanographic conditions persist , it is likely that its impact will spread to other areas of the ( @entity39 ) coast even during the fall , which could make the numbers increase and affect other marine species , " the report stated			0
the @entity39 ministry of environment said seafood is still safe to eat , and encouraged everyone to continue to support local fishermen , according to state - run @entity85 news agency			2
officials in @entity39 continue to search for the cause of death of almost 900 dolphins since the beginning of the year			0
the health ministry is awaiting final results from molecular analysis looking for the morbillivirus , which previously has been linked to dolphin deaths			0
the @entity2 agriculture and livestock ministry and staff from @entity13 ' center have called for a meeting with fishermen for monday			2
they are asking fishermen to try to save trapped birds before closing their nets			2
@entity13 said he worries that until monday , the number of dead birds could rise significantly .			0

warm waters off @entity39 have *chased* away fish , a *national* center studying @entity109 says
fish flee south to deeper , cooler waters , leaving 5,000 @entity39 surface - feeding birds dead
@entity2 birds have apparently feasted on such fleeing fish , an environment professor says
many of the dead @entity2 birds have injuries consistent with getting trapped in fishing nets
