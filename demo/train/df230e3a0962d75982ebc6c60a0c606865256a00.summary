@entity2 @entity0 and the @entity3 , the two largest democracies , seem like natural allies			1
the kinship between their leaders , however , has been a bit of a surprise			1
there are , of course , the obvious perceptual differences : president @entity14 studied law at @entity16 , relishes golf and prefers his suits sober , in dark gray or navy blue			1
prime minister @entity21 had a modest education , swears by yoga and readily wears flamboyant hats depicting @entity0 's diverse heritage			1
and then there 's the small matter of paperwork : @entity21 was a pariah in the @entity3 just one year ago , his visa revoked over his handling of riots in 2002 , when he was chief minister of the state of @entity34			1
but what a difference a year — and a big electoral victory — makes			0
when president @entity14 arrives in @entity2 on sunday , he will have met @entity21 four times in five months : at the @entity39 , at the @entity40 in @entity41 , at the @entity42 in @entity43 and now in @entity0			1
the latest visit is the most significant : @entity14 will become the first @entity3 president to visit @entity0 twice , and the first @entity3 chief guest at @entity0 's @entity48 parade			1
it 's an open declaration of friendship			0
what explains this unlikely rapport ? aides on both sides have pointed out that when the two leaders met in @entity57 in september , there was a palpable chemistry			0
they shared a sense of priorities , of where they wanted the alliance to head			0
on his previous visit to @entity0 , in 2009 , @entity14 spoke of the two democracies forming one of the " defining partnerships " of the 21st century			1
but in those initial years , the partnership became strained			0
first came a stalled nuclear deal ; later , a needless spat over an @entity0 diplomat in @entity73			1
@entity0 's disappointing growth , meanwhile , seemed to lead to declining interest			2
@entity21 has now successfully hit the reset button			0
by not bearing a grudge against @entity57 for blacklisting him , and by wooing @entity3 business with gusto , he has revived a flagging partnership			2
@entity3 who have negotiated with @entity0 teams under @entity21 say it 's evident the new prime minister has been clear with his envoys : it 's time to fix things with @entity57			1
and so it comes down to @entity21 and @entity14 in @entity2			2
@entity0 tv channels alternate between flashing banners saying " @entity92 " one minute and asking about " deliverables " from the summit the next			2
for days , teams in @entity94 have been hammering out a potential deal to trade civilian nuclear energy			0
there is talk of increased ties on defense , and on renewable energy			0
climate change will be an important topic for both sides : @entity0 generates more than half its energy needs from the dirtiest fuel in common use , coal			2
and there will be much more soaring rhetoric			0
on a visit earlier this month , @entity3 secretary of state @entity111 called for trade between the two countries to multiply five times			2
that will be unattainable for quite a while			0
it may be asking too much to judge the @entity21 - @entity14 summit through deliverables alone			2
after all , the invitation came just a couple of months ago when the two met in @entity41			0
symbolism has inherent value : by visiting @entity0 for a second time , @entity14 is putting @entity2 on the map in @entity57			1
in @entity0 , he will be seen by a generation of young @entity0 on tv ; they will glow with pride that the world 's most powerful man has come to town once again			0
the real work between the two countries will continue at a smaller , ongoing level : with increased people - to - people contact , with more trade , with more tourism , with an energized @entity0 diaspora in the @entity3 , and with many , many more days of talks between the two countries ' envoys			1
in many ways , the people on both sides are ahead of policy			0
according to a @entity150 survey last year , 58 % of @entity0 view @entity3 favorably , with only 18 % holding an unfavorable view			1
it 's time for government to catch up			0
with both @entity0 and the @entity3 benefiting from lower crude prices and a growth upswing , this is as good a time as any .			1
