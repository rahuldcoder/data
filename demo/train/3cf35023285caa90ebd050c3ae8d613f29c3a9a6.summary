when @entity3 , the first suspected member of @entity4 to stand trial in @entity6 , was arrested upon his arrival back in @entity8 in december after spending six months in @entity9 , youth team football coach @entity1 was left shell - shocked			1
the coach thought for a while and then it slowly sank in -- this was the same boy who had once stood by his side and taken the field in the shirt of @entity8 , @entity6 's largest @entity19 sports club			1
@entity1 's phone began to buzz with journalists trying to ask him whether he remembered @entity3 , a 20 - year - old born in @entity8 to @entity24 parents			1

" this was a guy who used to play with @entity19 players every week , he was comfortable there and he seemed so happy			1
" he was a normal player , never shouting too much and was fighting on the field with his friends			0
" we are a @entity19 club with a @entity19 heart -- and everybody who has been involved with us knows that			1

" we do n't want to destroy his future with all our power , " said @entity46 during the trial last month			0
a sentence is expected to be handed down in the coming weeks			1
in a written statement read out by his lawyer during the court case , @entity3 explained his motivation for traveling to @entity9 via @entity61 in july 2013			2
" the inconceivable violence used by the @entity64 regime against the @entity66 majority was enraging and bewildering			0
no - one wanted to help the people there , " it said			0

it has opened its doors to everyone in the past decade , with @entity1 insisting @entity8 " does not talk about integration , it lives integration			2

" they asked whether we should go back to just looking after our own but i said we can not do that because of one person			0
