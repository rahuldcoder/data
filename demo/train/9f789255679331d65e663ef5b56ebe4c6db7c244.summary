-- @entity1 is the rising star of @entity3 football			1
the 24 - year - old has been likened to a @entity3 @entity5 , both as an attacking midfielder with devastating free - kick skills , and as a pin - up with a distinctive off - the - pitch style			1
but the @entity11 player would rather be known for his own achievements			1
" i 'm not [ @entity5 ] and i do n't think i can ever become him			2
i want to create something by myself , out of my own individuality			2
i want to show the world myself , not copying other people , " he told @entity0			2
" like any other football player i want to be number one , professionally			1
but on the other hand , i want to work on my appearance while i 'm working on my football skills , pointing out that a best football player can be the most handsome one , too			1
these are probably the two ideas which help me express myself			2
" by plying his trade in @entity25 he 's already achieved more than most @entity27 footballers			0
a large part of his drive to succeed comes from a disciplined upbringing -- " [ my father ] would always get mad at me if i was n't the best " -- that fostered in @entity32 a competitive instinct and strong work ethic			0
he first played for @entity36 team @entity35 8 before spending two seasons with @entity39 side @entity38 ; he moved to @entity40 in december 2009			1
despite joining the @entity43 side for a fee of around $ 13 million less than a year ago there is speculation that @entity32 will move to a top club possibly in @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 later this winter			1
if the footballer had his wish there would only be one destination : " when i was a little kid i loved @entity54			1
if i could play for that club , it would be a huge personal achievement for me			1
i think my dreams would come true then			0
to achieve that , i need to work really hard			0
so , day after day , i concentrate and i work hard			0
and maybe in the future @entity54 will invite me to join the club , " he said			1
@entity32 has made his mark during his time in @entity40 , helping the team make the group stages of the @entity66 last season			2
his good form continued through the summer with @entity69 in the @entity70 , scoring the winning goal against @entity72			0
@entity32 however is candid about the national team 's chances of greater success in the future			2
" there are several problems			0
i think our main problem is ... there are no really strong strikers			0
we do n't know very well how to score			0
if the @entity3 team can work on that weakness , we will become a country with a football team that deserves respect on the highest level , " he said			1
and @entity32 is determined to do whatever it takes to play consistently at the highest level			2
" a constant pressure is something that this sport wo n't exist without			0
i will keep on feeling this pressure as long as i am playing			0
without it , it would n't be exciting			0
i 'm planning on following a principle of high risk and high return , aiming only at the highest goals			0
" @entity1 talked to @entity0 at the @entity99 , @entity40			1
