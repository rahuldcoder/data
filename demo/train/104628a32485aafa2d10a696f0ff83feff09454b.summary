-- there 's no skirting around the issue -- short shorts , long shorts -- it does n't matter to the biggest name in women 's football , @entity8			1
who better to talk about the struggles facing the sport than the woman known across the world as " the female @entity14 ? " in fact , if you ask @entity14 himself , largely acknowledged to be the greatest player to have ever kicked a football , he will tell you that he calls her " @entity14 with skirts			1
" unlike the suggestion of @entity26 president @entity25 , who said in 2004 that women soccer players could wear skimpier outfits to make the sport more appealing , @entity14 's comment was taken as a compliment			1
" let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball , " @entity25 said at the time			0
" they could , for example , have tighter shorts			0
" which clothes players wear are irrelevant according to @entity8 -- but ensuring that women 's football retains a sense of femininity is important to the five - time @entity41			1
" i 'm all in favor of us not losing our essence , our female side , because we are women and we have to be proud of that , " the @entity43 star told @entity0 's " an @entity45 " documentary			1
" we have to have some vanity ; we have to take care of ourselves and keep our spirits high			0
i think what really matters is the support you get in football regardless of the uniform you wear			0
" some girls feel good playing in long shorts while some of them feel good playing in tighter shorts			0
i 'm not against it			0
it 's obvious that women have to explore that female side of things and i do n't think that 's a mistake			1
" campaigner @entity8 is one of the most vocal campaigners in the battle for equality in women 's football			1
not bad for a girl who grew up in @entity75 , playing football on the streets against boys twice her size and without any formative coaching until the age of 14			2
fast forward to 2013 , and the 27 - year - old is one of the most recognizable faces in the sport , starring for @entity87 side @entity86 in @entity88			1
like @entity8 , women 's football has come a long way too since it held its debut at the @entity92 in @entity93 , where nearly 80,000 watched the @entity94 win gold			1
three years later , over 90,000 people were packed into the @entity98 @entity97 , @entity99 , for the 1999 @entity100 as the @entity94 defeated @entity101			0
on the club front , the @entity105 @entity104 women 's @entity102 has been gaining in popularity since its inception in 2001			1
and yet still @entity8 believes that attitudes towards women within football have remained stuck in the past			1
prejudice " i think it has changed a bit but that mentality still exists , " she said			0
" there 's still prejudice and that resistance regarding women not only on female football but in various activities			1
" men think that women are a bit fragile to perform some types of activities or do n't have the ability and are n't strong enough			0
" that does n't exist anymore			0
women have shown they have capabilities in every sense better than men a lot of time , but it 's that whole macho thing			2
" @entity137 in @entity43 is seen as a masculine sport , even with a lot of people accepting the female sport			2
there 's still a percentage that thinks like in the old days			0
" while women 's football has struggled to gain its share of the limelight in @entity43 , the sport is booming across the globe			1
according to the latest figures published by @entity26 , the world 's governing body , 29 million women and girls play football worldwide			2
that 's a huge increase from 1971 , when three international teams played just two matches -- by 2011 there were 129 teams playing 514 games			2
but while the women 's game has grown in the @entity94 and @entity104 , progress has been far more difficult to achieve in @entity43			1
even the achievements of the national team , which has won two silver medals and finished as runner - up at the last @entity100 , has not been enough to get the professional game off the ground			2
fighting " when you have competitions like the @entity173 or the @entity100 , then it captures people 's attention and that of the media , " said @entity8			2
" but when that moment has passed and @entity43 has n't played well or won , then you lose that attention			2
" maybe that 's what 's missing for people who can do something for @entity43 female football , to actually wake up and change the reality of female football because we have three medals			1
" those three medals till today were useless because our reality has n't changed that much			0
there was a promise of starting a league , of doing this , of doing that , but in reality nothing was done and we are still fighting			0
" we want to try and carry @entity43 's name to the top but we do n't have the support			2
" @entity8 was 21 when she played in front of a staggering 70,000 at @entity205 's famous @entity204 -- an occasion where @entity43 defeated the @entity94 under - 20 team in the final of the 2007 @entity209			1
but that attendance is an anomaly in a country where the game has little chance of competing for media attention against the constant frenzy surrounding men 's football			2
funding is scarce , sponsorship even more so , and while women 's football is televised on a regular level in the @entity94 in @entity104 , @entity43 is still lagging behind			1
@entity8 , who has played in the @entity94 and now in @entity223 , has seen first hand the benefits of having sponsors and investment -- and now wants companies to invest in @entity43 's women			1
weaker sex " there 's still the prejudice of thinking women are the weaker sex or that they were n't born to play sports , " @entity8 said			1
" i think people need to stop that and give us credit			0
" i know that when people come to invest they want an immediate return , but that does n't happen			0
" there needs to be a schedule			0
with investment you will have television companies broadcasting the games and you will have more sponsorship			0
" if we work on a project to bring more people to the stadium then television companies and sponsors will look at this and think it 's a cool initiative			0
" that will lead them to get even more involved			0
it has to be something where every side can be involved but it has to be out of solidarity and not to gain something out of female football , because at this point we ca n't really give away immediate return			1
" @entity269 a lack of funding and investment combined with the demise of her former club , @entity276 , paints a bleak picture for the women 's game in @entity43			1
but for someone who has broken down barriers from the very time she first touched a football as an inquisitive youngster , there is still hope			0
according to @entity8 , the @entity43 @entity287 , the government and @entity26 are all working together to establish a women 's league which will be made possible through outside investment			1
" there is hope for the future , " she said			0
" i hope they will create a league to give continuity and allow the girls to learn the basics so when they graduate to the national team , they are ready and developed			2
" i really hope that happens , if not in my generation then in the ones that follow			0

@entity8 is considered to be one of the greatest female football players in *history*
the @entity43 has won the @entity309 award on five occasions
the 27 - year - old began playing soccer as a child against the local boys in her area
she is hoping that @entity43 will launch a national league for women 's teams
