@entity0 , @entity1 -- for many @entity6 , the scariest phrase in the @entity5 language is " changing demographics			1
" it 's never easy to adjust to change -- especially when the thing that is changing is nothing less than the complexion of the country			1
@entity6 is being transformed before our eyes			1
in the early years of the 21st century , many white @entity6 are trembling at the thought that -- within three decades -- they 'll be the minority in the @entity6			1
the demographic " doomsday " is about 2043 , according to the most recent projections			2
if you 're the kind of person who stays up at night worrying about such things -- either because you fear that you will be marginalized in the future , or because you 're feeling a little guilty over how african - americans , latinos , and asian - americans have been treated and you 're hoping they 're not holding any grudges -- living in @entity6 at this moment means having to endure one terrifying story after another			1
in 2012 , the @entity33 revealed that -- because of immigration , and high birthrates among @entity27 and @entity37 -- whites had become a minority among babies			2
in 2013 , the headline was that , for the first time , racial and ethnic minorities made up about half of @entity6 under the age of 5			1
now comes this bit of news , which is likely to send more @entity6 scrambling for their blood pressure medicine			1
according to the @entity50 , starting this fall , @entity6 public schools are projected , for the first time , to have more minority students than whites			1
at 49.8 percent , whites are still expected to be the largest racial group in the public schools			1
yet , minority students will now make up the majority			2
and about one in four of those minority students will be @entity56			0
this turnaround has already occurred in some states , most notably @entity59 and @entity1			0
and now it 's about to happen on a national scale			0
the economic , political and social implications of this demographic sea change will extend far and wide			2
for one thing , the immigration debate will continue to erupt periodically , every few years			0
after all , what drives much of that discussion is n't concerns about border security or the rule of law			0
that 's just the window dressing			0
the real fuel is nativist anxiety over the ethnic transformation of our neighborhoods , towns and cities			0
we 'll also keep fighting about language and culture , as one way of life yields to another			0
in addition , there will be greater expectations on @entity27 in particular -- who now comprise 17 % of the @entity6 population and who , by 2043 , are expected to account for as much as 25 % -- to convert those population figures into something more tangible , such as political power			1
already , many political observers wonder why one has n't led to the other			0
as the numbers increase , that curiosity will become more intense			0
specific to what will be happening in the schools , we can also expect greater demand for bilingual teachers and more resistance from older taxpayers to having to approve additional property tax bonds to pay for what will be a necessary expansion of school facilities in the years to come			2
that is awfully shortsighted given that the elderly rely on younger workers to pay for their @entity113 and @entity114			0
it may surprise you to hear it , but i cringe every time i see one of these stories about changing demographics , if it does n't come with the proper context			1
they get people all wound up for no reason , and needlessly pit groups of @entity6 against one another			1
they give latinos , african - americans and @entity37 a sense of false hope that , just around the corner , respect and power are on the way and life is about to get better			0
and they scare the dickens out of whites who , sensing that a storm is on the way , inevitably try to batten down the hatches by passing more restrictive laws			0
there 's not much any of us can do to stop these changes from happening			0
but there is no reason to fear them either			2
immigrants change @entity6 , but @entity6 returns the favor and changes them right back			1
for instance , @entity5 is the dominant language in the @entity6 , and so many immigrants will wind up speaking @entity5 within a matter of months or years			1
their children will speak @entity5 as their primary language , as the immigrant 's native language fades away			0
where some @entity6 look at changing population figures and see calamity , i only see opportunity			1
this country continues to draw to its shores the determined and the daring , who come here -- to the land of second chances -- to reinvent themselves and , in the process , wind up remaking and revitalizing the country			1
that 's not a threat to @entity6			2
it 's the very essence of @entity6			2
join us on @entity186 / @entity185 .			0

for the first time , minorities will exceed white population in @entity6 public schools
@entity193 says that some may fear the change , but the *results* are *positive*
he says immigrants change @entity6 , but @entity6 winds up changing immigrants
@entity193 : immigrants reinvent themselves and wind up revitalizing the @entity6
