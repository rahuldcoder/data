-- the increasingly slapstick global steeplechase in pursuit of @entity3 , the former @entity5 contractor who leaked top - secret details of surveillance programs , looks like a cross between " @entity10 " and " @entity11			1
" nobody , except perhaps @entity3 himself , is coming out of this well			1
while the @entity15 's @entity14 plays captain @entity16 , keeping stumm beneath the ( radio ) waves in the @entity23 transit zone , very important people are making themselves ridiculous in vintage @entity25 style			1
high on the list is @entity28 , @entity5 secretary of state			1
huffing and puffing , @entity28 warned @entity29 and @entity30 of " consequences " if , as seems probable , they have conspired to deliberately thwart @entity5 justice by twisting the long arm of the law			1
like too many @entity5 politicians , @entity28 seems to believe " the law " is what the @entity38 counsel and @entity39 deem it to be on any given day , and that this made - in - @entity46 " law " applies inexorably to every country and every corner of the world			1
it 's like invading somebody else 's country without a @entity52 resolution , or entering a home without a warrant			2
not advisable , unless you relish hand - to - hand combat and endless sarcasm			2
quite what @entity28 's " consequences " may be is not specified -- but the idea sounds arrogant to foreign ears			2
perhaps the @entity5 will retaliate by ordering the secret hacking of @entity29 government data banks ? wait a minute			1
has n't that been done already ? to @entity65 eyes , @entity3 is a new , more useful kind of @entity67			1
having picked his brains or pockets or both , @entity71 happily let him go			1
@entity30 says it feels " threatened " by @entity5 criticism			1
this is as close as @entity74 , @entity23 's dour foreign minister , has ever got to making a joke			1
if @entity76 and pals can stiff @entity78 on @entity79 and @entity80 , they can certainly " lift " a tale - teller and endure a cyber-tiff or two			2
these are tears of laughter , not pain			2
crowing @entity29 comments about how the heroic @entity3 has " torn off @entity89 's sanctimonious mask " give a clue to what is going on here			1
so , too , does the uppity behavior of tiny @entity93 and @entity94			2
if these international minnows dare challenge the pomp and majesty of @entity46 , how stands the @entity98 now , @entity99 ? fraying at the edges , is the answer			2
for @entity78 et al , it 's a " pants - down " day			2
@entity105 has provided a glorious field day for all those " surrender monkey @entity107 long - haired @entity112 - loathing eco-friendly global - warming anti-free market anti-capitalist anti-mcdonald 's ( anti-stereotype ) " anti-americans who just love to hate the " @entity109			1
" it 's surprising how many of them there are these days			2
perhaps it has something to do with @entity119			0
for sure , the @entity120 has no problem with detaining people indefinitely without charge			0
after all , they 've been doing it for years			0
but it comes hard from a global superpower that is constantly lecturing @entity29 and everybody else about the inviolability of human rights			1
perhaps it 's a @entity132 thing			0
there 's a lot of sympathy out there for the pint - sized soldier who dared to share the @entity139 's incredibly tedious cables , then got treated worse than a mass murderer			0
every country has its own experience of @entity5 bullying			1
in @entity149 , the case of @entity146 hacker @entity145 , accused by the @entity5 of the " biggest military computer hack of all time " , became a cause celebre			1
in the end even @entity149 's sycophantic @entity152 government was obliged , by force of public opinion , to throw out the @entity5 extradition demand			1
where could @entity3 go next ? perhaps it 's the way the @entity5 ignores its friends ' environmental and resource concerns			1
perhaps people in the global village are growing less tolerant of a domineering , one - size - fits - all philistine culture			0
@entity80 has a pithy catchphrase for it			0
it calls @entity46 the " @entity170			0
" or perhaps it 's a " white man 's burden " thing			0
that 's the phrase the @entity149 used to morally justify their empire - building			0
they were doing good , or so they told themselves , annexing all those countries and subjugating their peoples			0
geopolitically speaking , @entity89 took over where @entity182 left off , post 1945			0
except the @entity5 equivalent phrase is " right man 's burden "			1
that is to say , we ( that 's the imperial @entity89 ' we ' ) are ( always ) right , and you ( lesser mortals , sadly benighted ) are ( always ) wrong			0
the world watched this attitude play out in @entity195 and @entity196 ( intervention to make @entity46 's streets safe ) and now in @entity79 ( non-intervention to make @entity46 's streets safe )			0
pity all those displaced and terrorised @entity202 , but hey , we fixed @entity203 did n't we ? strange that sense of triumph over the killing of the 9/11 mastermind was not universally shared			0
extra-judicial assassination , drones , killer robots , extraordinary rendition , black ops , wet ops , psy - ops , silly ops ... the world is a bit tired of all this @entity5 posturing , grandstanding , and self - serving banditry			2
so now it 's cyber-ops , but wholly unofficial , courtesy mr @entity222			0
it would hard to accept it is real , if you did n't suspect it was virtual			0
rather than decry it , many applaud it			0
the @entity38 is furious at the non-cooperation it has received			0
but has it occurred to them that maybe not just the @entity30 and the @entity29 , but those soft , liberal @entity232 and all the other neutrals also do n't like the idea of being spied on by an out - of - control transnational agency beyond the reach of the law , any law , anywhere ? @entity78 and @entity28 can talk about security until they lose signal			1
right now , the rest of the world is talking sovereignty , privacy and individual rights			0
and enjoying the moment when the big guy takes a fall			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2
