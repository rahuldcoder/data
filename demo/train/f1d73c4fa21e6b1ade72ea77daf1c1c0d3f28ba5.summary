@entity0 -- the gate crashers @entity3 and @entity4 want to be famous as stars of reality television			2
i am all for that			0
give them a reality television series and call it " trial and @entity12 " in the @entity14 criminal justice system			0
this despicable , desperate , duplicitous couple disgraced the @entity16 and embarrassed the president in his home			1
they totally overshadowed the president 's meeting with @entity23 prime minister @entity22 , the leader of an important ally			0
the incident made the @entity27 ' first state dinner , honoring the prime minister and his wife , @entity29 , fodder for comedians -- and it certainly raises security concerns for other world leaders visiting at later dates			1
the gate - crashers need to be held accountable and not glorified			1
unless they have some excuse we have n't heard yet , the @entity36 deserve to be charged with criminal trespassing and lying to federal officers for starters			1
yes , they dressed for the occasion , but the @entity36 are no different , and should n't be regarded any differently , than a nut case who jumps over the @entity46 fence and tries to run in the front door			1
the only difference is that the fence - jumper would be shot ten feet from his entrance point			0
i worked in a couple of @entity54 and have always had the greatest respect for the @entity16			1
these men and women put their lives on the line daily and often serve in long and tedious tours of duty			0
i worked in the @entity46 when president @entity62 was shot and i saw the extraordinary bravery of @entity16 agent @entity64 , who was critically wounded when he took a bullet in the stomach after turning and putting his body between the president and the shooter , @entity70			1
but for all the bravery of its agents , the @entity16 lives in a world that demands zero defects			1
so i have to tell you i am appalled at the comments by the @entity16 spokesman who was described as saying it had n't been determined whether party - crashing is technically illegal			1
he went on to say he did n't believe the @entity36 posed a security risk			2
spin control is not needed now			0
responsibility is the key word			0
how does the @entity16 know whether the @entity36 were a risk or not ? the service apparently had not done a background check on them -- unlike every other guest and government employee in the tent that night -- because they were n't on the invitation list			1
@entity16 director @entity96 issued a rare apology , saying the service took full responsibility for the episode and was " deeply concerned and embarrassed			2
" not good enough ! he needs to determine who was responsible for letting the @entity36 onto the @entity46 grounds and fire whoever it was , before he thinks about offering his own resignation			2
public servants have to be held accountable and now is a good time to start			1
secretary of defense @entity108 has fired some of the top people in the military because they were not performing at the level he expected			0
can homeland security secretary @entity113 , whose department oversees the @entity16 , expect any less ? can an agency , @entity116 , that has responsibility for securing our borders be trusted if it can not even secure the @entity46 ? we live in a world of reality television in which egotists try to be famous for three minutes and land an appearance on the talk shows			1
the bigger question is what example this sets for our kids			0
if we glorify the actions of people like the @entity36 and do n't hold them accountable , how do we teach our kids what is right and what is wrong ? the @entity36 claim there 's more to the story			2
their lawyer says they were n't crashing the party , but the @entity16 says otherwise			1
based on the facts as we know them so far , there 's a simple way to deal with this case			0
charge them , prosecute them , and if a @entity14 jury finds them guilty , jail them			0
make an example out of them			0
then next november when the president is pardoning the @entity150 turkey , he can pardon them too			0
and after the pardon , as is traditional for the turkeys whose lives are spared , they can go live in @entity157 -- a fantasy world that seems to be the perfect place for this pair			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			2

the @entity46 said an *uninvited* couple crashed the state dinner
@entity163 says the incident was a disgrace and is n't a *laughing* matter
he says the @entity16 must be held accountable for the lapse
@entity163 says the couple should be charged criminally and jailed if *convicted*
