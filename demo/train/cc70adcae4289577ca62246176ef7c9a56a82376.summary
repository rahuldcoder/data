-- from a young basketball hopeful in @entity2 , @entity3 to fifth overall pick in the @entity5 for the @entity6			1
@entity8 's journey to the top of gridiron has been sprinkled with more than a hint of stardust			1
when the 23 - year - old , who also played soccer as a child , moved to the @entity16 in 2008 , he could n't have dreamed of what came to pass in @entity18 on thursday on the opening day of the draft , when the @entity5 's 32 teams pick up young college talent			1
" i 've worked hard toward this and i actually earned it , " @entity8 , who only began playing football in 2010 , told reporters on a conference call after being drafted by the @entity6			1
" it 's been a humbling experience and a crazy journey			2
" the 23 - year - old @entity3 arrived in the @entity16 on an academic scholarship with the @entity32 in @entity33 , which is owned and operated by the @entity34 -- more commonly known as the @entity34			1
keen to pursue his hoop dreams , @entity8 tried out for the basketball team , but after failing to make the grade , he took up athletics because of his sprinting speed			1
@entity8 ran the 100 meters in 10.91 seconds and the 200m in 21.89 secs , according to the official website of the @entity6			1
when you couple that athletic speed with an imposing six feet five inches frame -- @entity8 weighs 275 pounds -- it is not hard to see why he appealed to the school 's football team			2
despite his lack of playing experience , @entity6 general manager @entity48 suggested he can be an immediate asset for the team			2
" i do see him as an impactful player right away , " said @entity48			0
" @entity55 come when they come ... but he 's going to be a guy that will play a big role for us on defense			2
" @entity8 's adjustment to life in the @entity5 might be made all the easier as he has already worked with @entity6 head coach @entity63 at the senior bowl -- the annual game which pits the best draft prospects against each other			1
" it will be a lot easier			0
i 'm really comfortable with them , " added @entity8 , whose mother @entity70 was flown over to join her son at @entity18 's @entity72 , where the draft is held			1
" i know how our coach is so , you know , just like giving me that chance is going to make it a lot easier			0
" it does n't matter the experience that i 've got			0
all i know is i 've just got to produce and work on my technique and i know that the @entity6 are willing to work with me			2
" i 'm not going to make any promises			0
all i have to do is work hard and see what happens			0
" @entity63 , who coached a team of prospects from schools in the south in the @entity64 , has been impressed with what he saw from @entity8			2
the @entity6 coach will be hoping @entity8 , who was the @entity64 's most outstanding player , can improve a @entity6 team which had a losing record of 4 - 12 in 2012			1
" we watched him get better every single day , " said @entity63			0
" he 's an inexperienced player , but he 's a very instinctive player			0
we liked everything about him			0
we had a good feel for him			0
" he 's inexperienced , but he 's not a developmental player			0
