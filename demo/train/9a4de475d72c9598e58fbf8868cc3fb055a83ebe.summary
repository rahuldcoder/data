@entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 has announced that death row inmates and ringleaders of the @entity7 drug smuggling ring , @entity8 and @entity9 , will be transferred from @entity11 prison			1
it 's the first step in their last walk to the firing squad			0
the two -- who were convicted of a failed attempt to smuggle heroin to @entity1 in 2005 -- are now more than likely to be taken out to a field on nusakambangan , a prison island off @entity21 , and shot dead			1
besides the horror of the death penalty -- something @entity1 only dispensed of in 1967 -- there is so much unnecessary tragedy in this case			1
some of it rests on the shoulders of the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , who tipped off the @entity3 police after receiving information from a worried father of one of the duo 's mules			1
some rests on the own shoulders of the men , who made one terrible , foolish mistake while young			0
however , a lot of it also rests with @entity3 and its president @entity43 , whose cruel lack of compromise and desire to clear out the prisons has seen him categorically turn down any chance of clemency -- even though this potentially flouts @entity3 law			1
@entity43 has said he will deny clemency for all drug offenders			1
@entity3 legal teams are now scrambling a submission to the administrative court , arguing that the president ca n't deny clemency for all drug cases , but must consider each case individually			1
@entity43 is also following the lead of the @entity3 public , which in the main believes in the death penalty			1
of course , this is in stark contrast to the work @entity3 does to get its own citizens off death row around the world			1
the president 's hard - line stance is n't just about trying to win some breathing space with an electorate , which in the vast majority is disappointed with his presidency			2
he may be also trying to distract them from ongoing corruption scandals , the persistence of cronyism and his inability to break free from the shackles of his political benefactor @entity84			0
most significantly though , @entity85 has announced a war on drugs , which he sees as devastating the nation			2
the drug " crisis " is described by @entity43 as a " national emergency			2
" according to the president , 4.5 million @entity3 need to be rehabilitated from illicit or illegal drug use , and 40 to 50 young people die from drugs a day			1
this data has shown to be based on questionable statistics			0
even so , it tempers much of @entity43 's thinking on the need for rehabilitation			1
and here 's where another perspective on rehabilitation comes in			0
in @entity8 and @entity9 , dubbed the pastor and the painter respectively , the president not only has clear examples of rehabilitation , but effective tools for combating the scourge of drug smuggling in his own country and rehabilitating those of his citizens most in need this is in part due to the characteristics and qualities of the @entity3 prison system			1
let 's just say that the two were , with the rest of the @entity7 , allowed to board flights for @entity1 and nabbed by the @entity30 instead of @entity3 's @entity126			1
serving up to 10 years in an @entity1 prison , would they have been reformed ? with a recidivism rate of over 50 % and the sterile security conditions that commonly lead to psychological distress and not change , probably not			2
that might lead one to assume that something about their time in @entity128 contributed to their reformation , something they would more than likely not have experienced here in @entity1			2
what can be learned from this hypothesis ? @entity8 and @entity9 's experiences show genuine clear signs of rehabilitation			0
so how could this rehabilitation occur in @entity128 prison , which is claimed to be a " hell hole " ? by default and not by design , prisons like @entity128 share many positive aspects that are often overlooked by contemporary prison reformists			0
as @entity3 corrections do n't have the resources to care or provide for inmates , the inmates take it upon themselves to fund and run their own rehabilitation programs			2
there is also more buy in from @entity160 who also support the inmate programs and the amazing support structures that are created by inmates in prisons in developing countries like @entity3 and the @entity167			2
these include their own businesses to support themselves and family , which keep them occupied and sometimes away from criminal pursuits			0
in the end , in some cases , the prison community becomes a natural environment for rehabilitation			0
a study on recidivism in @entity3 may paint a more accurate picture as precise figures are hard to come by			0
of course , corruption , criminality and drug running remain very real issues			0
@entity8 and @entity9 demonstrate a clear sense of remorse and with it the chance of redemption			0
if rehabilitated returning fighters can be used to help dissuade and can be used to help other young men from making the same mistake , why ca n't convicted and remorseful drug smugglers do the same ? beyond how unpalatable the notion may be to many , this is yet another reason why it is a real shame the two will be executed -- here are clear examples of successful rehabilitation that should be held high with pride by the @entity3 government , not shot down in history			1
instead , their execution could potentially dampen other inmates ' enthusiasm to reform or change in @entity3			0
in all prisons , hope is critical for moral and rehabilitation , especially in under - resourced prisons where conditions are harsh			0
in this case , as with many more , the death penalty is no silver bullet solution , and in fact hits terribly wide of the mark			0
there is no conclusive evidence that the death penalty has any real deterrence value			0
these two men , who fully admit they made an awful error judgement in while their early 20s , offer a glimpse on how @entity43 's war on drugs can be won without having to lose more lives -- without having to fire a single shot .			1

two @entity1 are days away from being executed on drugs charges in @entity3
calls for clemency ignored by @entity3 president @entity43
