@entity0 , @entity1 -- running a technology news site based in @entity4 that focuses on tech news from @entity4 and @entity6 it 's to be expected that i am a little attached to the region			1
according to a @entity10 report @entity11 spend in @entity12 is approximately $ 70 billion and will nearly double by 2015			0
there is also no doubt @entity4 is on fire right now when it comes to being at the forefront of innovation in mobile ( which is where the future of the web lies ) with hubs in @entity26 and @entity27			1
read more : how mobile broadband can transform @entity4 so naturally when the " all star entrepreneur " panel took the @entity33 stage , i asked : " so are any of you investing in @entity4 ? " the panel : " no "			1
no ? why not ? @entity37 founder and former editor @entity36 says it 's because he has n't been pitched anything from @entity4			1
the rest of the panel , included : @entity44 founder @entity43 , @entity46 founder @entity45 , and @entity48 founder , @entity49 ¶ m. @entity33 is an event that champions the next stage in our online evolution and yet there seems to be very little @entity56 presence or discussion around the future of the web there			0
more : 10 @entity56 tech voices to follow on twitter more and more are accessing content on their mobile devices , because let 's face it , this is where the world is heading			0
as @entity70 we arrived late to the internet party and most of the cool innovative party favors were gone			0
but we are hungry for access and content			0
hence the huge potential in @entity4 for mobile app creators and companies that rely in the mobile space			1
few of the companies presenting at @entity33 seems to have a focus in @entity4 , they seem intent on conquering the @entity84 market			1
yes some want to conquer @entity86 and the rest of @entity88 too			0
but why are they ignoring @entity4 ? what did we do ? a few questions immediately come to mind			1
is it a case of access ? internet penetration ? access is that still a major issue ? according to the head of @entity102 , there are 695 million mobile subscriptions in @entity4 and it is predicted to hit 735 million by the end of 2012			1
the most common mobile device in southern parts of @entity4 is the @entity107 and it can access the web			1
more than 5 % of @entity70 own the @entity109 , according to researchers at @entity111			0
mobile penetration in @entity4 is about 70 % or so			1

not an attractive figure for potential investors maybe ? no , it says there is huge potential for growth			1
that figure says that there is an 86.5 % growth potential if we want to add numbers to it			0
low internet does n't mean a deadzone			0
@entity4 is moving on quite swiftly then			1
there are companies such as @entity136 , that recognize this growth potential in @entity4 and they are beginning to invest in the continent			1
@entity136 has launched the @entity141 project in @entity4 and @entity142 in @entity143			2
read more : humans , lose your cyberphobia i suppose the argument could be that @entity33 is n't focused on @entity4 because it is designed for @entity84 and how technology is shaping the continent			2
maybe , but most of the speakers are from the @entity152			0
all are innovating in various ways true but there are equally innovative and quite frankly more useful products coming out of @entity4			2
where are the speakers from @entity4 ? someone from @entity159 for instance should be here			2
the non-profit software company that develops open source software for information collection , visualization and interactive mapping			0
surely it has more to say about the innovative use of technology than @entity169			0
then there is innovation in social and communication companies such as @entity174 , which is a mobile communication platform across all types of devices , and if you listen to its new ceo @entity181 - @entity180 , it is well on its way to " conquering the @entity56 market "			1
this particular conference is backed by government			0
that signals something important : @entity84 government cares about innovation in tech and perhaps innovating with it			0
take note here @entity56 governments			0
when i bumped into @entity36 before his session he seemed to think there is n't much @entity4 can do for his fund			2
he also seems to think there is a security issue in @entity4			2
can this really still be the notion that @entity4 has nothing to offer when it comes to the web and how we are evolving ? take a trip to @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 or attend an @entity212 event , which champions @entity56 tech growth , and see how wrong you are			2
