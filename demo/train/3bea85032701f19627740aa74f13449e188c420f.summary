-- during a 1996 interview with television talk show host @entity4 , @entity2 co-founder @entity1 took exception to @entity8 's characterization of him as " a guy who founds high - tech companies and tries to make another billion			1
" " yeah , well , i do n't think of myself that way , " @entity1 said			2
" the things that i have done in my life , i think the things we do now at @entity16 [ the animation company he bought in 1986 ] , these are team sports			2
they are not something one person does			0
" if pop culture were a team sport , @entity1 would have certainly played quarterback			2
from the invention of @entity26 , which completely changed the business of music , to offering the world its first completely full - length computer - generated animated film with @entity16 's " @entity31 " in 1995 , @entity1 left his indelible fingerprints on the entertainment industry			1
the other " toys " he helped create like the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 not only changed the way the world consumed media , but also inserted both @entity1 and @entity2 firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist			1
even the commercials , from the 1984 , @entity44 - inspired @entity43 ad to the more recent " are you a @entity46 or a pc , " were uber - cool			0
while @entity1 has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high - tech , he also made some power moves which forever changed @entity51			1
and in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods , it all began with @entity56			0
as @entity1 explained to the news program " @entity58 " in 2003 , when @entity56 was creating " @entity59 " he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog			1
the computer graphics division of his @entity65 company , which honed the technology behind the process , would go on to become @entity16 after @entity1 bought it for $ 10 million in 1986			1
as chairman and chief executive officer of @entity16 , @entity1 led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry			1
the world had n't even heard of computer - generated imagery ( @entity78 ) in 1991 when @entity16 struck a deal with @entity80 to develop and distribute three full - length animated films			1
the first of these , " @entity31 , " captured audience 's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children 's toys			0
" @entity31 " went on to become the top - earning film of that year , grossing $ 192 million in domestic box office receipts and $ 362 million worldwide			2
it spurred two sequels , theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise			0
it was followed by films like " @entity97 , " " @entity98 , " " @entity99 , " and " @entity100 , " the last two of which won @entity103 for best animated feature			0
@entity1 sold @entity16 to @entity105 in 2006			1
by then he was firmly back in the driver 's seat as the chief executive officer of @entity2 , which was setting the world afire with its inventions			2
one of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the @entity112 , which revolutionized the world of music downloads			2
" other companies sold digital music before @entity2 , " said @entity115 , editorial director of @entity116 , said in a statement			1
" other companies made digital music available on computers and digital phones and used it in commercials			0
@entity2 's brilliance -- and i do n't think anyone doubts that this was @entity1 ' brilliance -- was that @entity2 made it exciting and simple and effortless and fun			1
" @entity1 was a major influence on portable media , which paved the way for gamers to be able to engage in their favorite past time via handheld devices and film fans to be able to stream movies almost anywhere			1
the introduction of the 99 - cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes			0
the ability of the @entity38 , and later the @entity39 and @entity40 , to hold thousands of songs also meant that fans never had to be far from their tunes			0
" thanks for allowing me to put my whole cd collection in my pocket , " @entity149 , ex-frontman of the heavy metal band @entity150 tweeted after news of @entity1 ' death was made public			2
" you have made air travel a lot more fun among other things			0
" innovation was not without some growing pains , however			0
some industry insiders worried that digital downloads were negatively affecting sales of music and the issue of piracy became a hot one			0
on tuesday , @entity171 chief executive officer @entity170 in his keynote address at @entity173 , a tv and entertainment event held in @entity176 , @entity177 , pointed to digital monopolies like the one @entity2 has as potentially damaging to the industry			0
" @entity2 is the strongest company in the music industry because there was not enough competition , and still to this day there is not enough competition , " @entity170 said			0
" as an industry it ca n't then influence packaging , merchandising -- all the things that are vital			0
" @entity116 's @entity115 also noted that " today , the music business has a complex relationship with @entity2 , which has become yet another entity that built an enormous business atop the rights of music companies , much like radio and @entity196 before it			2
" " but i think you 'd be hard - pressed to find one music executive worth his or her salt who would n't agree that @entity1 ' vision and tenacity blazed a trail for digital music as we know it today , " @entity115 said			1
" without a doubt , when you think of the @entity207 of the music business -- pioneers like @entity210 and @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 - @entity1 has earned his prominent place			1
