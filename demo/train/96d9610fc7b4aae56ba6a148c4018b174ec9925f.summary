-- the combined following of @entity3 stars @entity4 and @entity5 on @entity6 is an impressive 7.7 million -- more than the population of @entity8			1
and to reflect the growing trend of footballers waxing lyrical on the micro-blogging site -- and occasionally overstepping the mark -- the @entity9 has now released their first ever set of guidelines on the subject			2
only this week @entity17 and @entity19 defender @entity18 caused a storm when he joined @entity6 and responded to the barbs from fans of his former club @entity23 by mocking them as to how many trophies he had won since leaving			1
and on tuesday the @entity26 charged @entity23 's @entity27 for bringing the game into disrepute for something he posted on @entity6			2
the @entity9 were quick to trumpet the benefits of having their stellar names on social media sites , like @entity6 and @entity35 , as it allows for interaction with numerous fans , but stressed it must be used responsibly			1
" social media is doing a good job of allowing fans to feel closer to the players , " @entity9 chairman @entity40 was quoted as saying on their official website			1
" there is a more human side now to some of the players and the public can communicate more directly with them			0
" clearly it is n't the same as texting your best mate or talking to someone in person and sometimes there can be abusive comments , but generally the internet , online chat rooms , and the way people are communicating is healthy			0
" according to the @entity9 , their @entity35 page and that of the 20 clubs in @entity19 's top division have attracted an aggregate of 60 million ' likes			1
' the figures underline the increasing importance of social media in sport , and the changing way in which people consume the action presented to them			1
more and more fans are not only watching the matches they attend , but filming them on mobile phones and uploading them to @entity6 , @entity35 or @entity80			1
" the pleasure of sport lies not so much in witnessing an event as talking about it , " @entity81 , professor of @entity82 at @entity19 's @entity83 , told @entity0 recently			0
" we 've all at some point sat at home and watched a fight or a tennis match in isolation and it 's never as enjoyable as when we are in company , talking about the competition as it unfolds			0
" mobile phones have opened out the possibilities			0
we can talk to anyone , anywhere while the action is taking place			0
" this new trend will be emphasized by the upcoming @entity105 , with the number of users on @entity35 having risen to 900 million -- nine times the figure it was for the @entity110 of 2008			1
with a wealth of action taking place during the @entity115 fans from across the globe can interact with each other via various platforms			2
@entity119 , chairman of the @entity120 , thinks the strides made in technology means that by the @entity115 there will be no such thing as a passive armchair fan			0
" they ( the armchair fans ) are part of the action , " he told reporters at the launch of a study by technology firm @entity129			2
" they can comment on content , interact with the athletes , create and publish their own content			0
never before has there been such a channel to interact with the world , especially with young people			0

@entity9 *unveils* new code of conduct for social media websites
more and more soccer stars have their own @entity35 and @entity6 accounts
combined followers between @entity5 and @entity4 is 7.7 million
@entity9 says social media is a good for interaction with fans but must be used responsibly
