the @entity0 said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to @entity5 attacked @entity0 diplomatic compounds in @entity7 and @entity8 tuesday			1
in @entity7 , witnesses say members of a radical @entity12 group called @entity13 protested near the @entity0 @entity14 in @entity15 , where @entity17 jets established no - fly zones last year to halt ground attacks from then - @entity7 strongman @entity20			1
the group then clashed with security forces in the city , blocking roads leading to the consulate , witnesses said			2
the @entity0 ambassador to @entity7 , @entity28 , was killed in the attack , the @entity26 said			1
@entity30 , a @entity32 information management officer , and two other @entity0 personnel also died in the violence in @entity15 , secretary of state @entity35 said in a statement wednesday			1
" our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues , " @entity37 said			0
" all the @entity0 we lost in yesterday 's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice			1
we condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives , which they had committed to helping the @entity7 people reach for a better future , " she added			1
in an earlier statement , @entity37 said she condemned the attack on the @entity0 facilities " in the strongest terms " and that following tuesday 's events , the @entity0 government was " working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel , our missions and @entity0 citizens worldwide			1
" @entity7 's @entity62 also condemned the attack in @entity15 , saying it " led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals			1
" lawmakers said in a statement tuesday night that they were investigating			0
it was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated , @entity72 national security contributor @entity70 said tuesday night			0
" one such breach of an embassy or consulate 's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news			0
... the fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where @entity0 are remembering those that we lost , you have to ask yourself , what are @entity0 officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related ? " she asked			1
in @entity95 , several men scaled the walls of the @entity97 and tore down its @entity0 flag , according to @entity72 producer @entity99 , who was on the scene			1
police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing , but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the @entity0 compound			1
the black flag , which hangs in full view from inside the complex , is adorned with white characters that read , " there is no @entity116 but @entity117 and @entity118 is his messenger , " an emblem often used by @entity5 radicals			0
a volley of warning shots were fired as a large crowd gathered around the compound , although it is not clear who fired the shots			0
are you there ? share your images and videos			0
@entity8 groups point to @entity0 websites , including @entity134 , that have scenes from the film			1
some anti-muslim blogs also have flagged the movie			0
in a series of disjointed scenes , filmmakers depict @entity118 as a child molester , womanizer and ruthless killer			0
the movie was made by @entity146 , an @entity147 - @entity0 real - estate developer , according to the @entity148			1
@entity146 -- who wrote , directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of @entity5 as a hateful religion , the @entity148 reported , citing a telephone interview with him			0
@entity146 , 52 , told the newspaper that to make the film , he had raised $ 5 million from about 100 @entity156 donors , who he declined to identify			0
he said he made the two - hour movie over a three - month period last year in @entity158 , using about 60 actors and 45 crew members , the @entity148 reported			0
most of the @entity5 world considers depictions of @entity118 to be blasphemous and deeply offensive			0
" some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the @entity168 , " @entity37 said			0
" the @entity0 deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others			1
our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation			0
" but she stressed that " there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind			0
" @entity97 officials issued a warning to @entity0 in @entity8 , telling them to avoid the demonstrations which " may gather in front of the @entity0 embassy , or @entity8 government buildings such as the @entity188 and @entity189			1
" " it is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets , but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another , " the @entity0 @entity97 said in a statement			1
" large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and @entity201 should be avoided this afternoon			0
" frenzied protesters could been seen tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded @entity0 flag to television camera crews while chanting anti- @entity0 slogans			1
an embassy phone operator told @entity72 that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day , ahead of the apparent threat , while @entity8 riot police and the army were called in			1
" this is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult , " said @entity213 , a spokesman for the @entity214			0
" but events like this are extremely deplorable			0
and we have to work to get things under control			0
" the @entity223 issued a statement tuesday , pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests ' potentially debilitating effects on the @entity8 economy			1
" there are police forces at the demonstrations , " @entity213 said			0
" they should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave			0
" several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations tuesday , including @entity240 leader @entity239 , who is president of @entity8 's conservative @entity242 television channel			1
@entity243 -- the brother of @entity245 leader @entity244 -- added , " we called for the peaceful protest joined by different @entity5 factions including the @entity248 ( and the ) @entity250 movement			2
" " we were surprised to see the big numbers show up , including the soccer @entity253 fans , " he said			2
" i just want to say , how would the @entity0 feel if films insulting leading @entity257 figures like the pope or historical figures like @entity260 were produced ? " he added that " the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner , alluding to topics like sex , which is not acceptable			1
" the @entity0 @entity97 in @entity95 announced that it had canceled visa services for wednesday			1
it also said in a statement that it " condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of @entity271 -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions			0
" " respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of @entity0 democracy , " the statement said			2
" we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others			0
" but the @entity0 @entity288 presidential nominee , @entity287 , suggested that the embassy 's statement had its priorities wrong			2
" it 's disgraceful that the @entity295 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks , " @entity287 said in a statement released late tuesday			2
he said he was " outraged " by the attacks in @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity301 released a strongly worded statement wednesday , condemning what he called the " outrageous attack " on the @entity15 compound that took the lives of four @entity0			1
" they exemplified @entity0 's commitment to freedom , justice , and partnership with nations and people around the globe , and stand in stark contrast to those who callously took their lives , " the president said			2
@entity301 also announced that he has ordered his administration " to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in @entity7 , and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe			1
" while the @entity0 rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others , we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants , " he added			2
demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the @entity8 street , where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former @entity8 president @entity341			2
this summer , @entity8 's first @entity12 president , @entity342 , was sworn into power at @entity344 , the scene of the nation 's revolution in 2011			2
though tuesday 's embassy protests are the first that @entity342 has dealt with , @entity8 recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the @entity147 and @entity353 embassies in unrelated episodes			1
" these protests are a bad image for @entity8 , " said a @entity95 street vendor named @entity356			2
" of course i 'm against insulting @entity5 , but it 's the undereducated , poor people who are out here causing problems			0
" " all i want for @entity8 is security and stability , " he said			2
" and as you can see this is n't it			0
" the incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the @entity0 in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead			2
tuesday 's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an @entity383 @entity382 lawmaker , which then sought to portray @entity5 as a violent religion			0
@entity387 ' film " @entity388 , " which he released online , featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the @entity392			0
report : @entity8 's ex-pm @entity394 faces arrest , extradition order @entity8 kills militants , seizes weapons in @entity400 offensive @entity0 companies eye @entity8 for investment			1
