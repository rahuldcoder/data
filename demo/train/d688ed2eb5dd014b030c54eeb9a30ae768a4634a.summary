@entity2 , the neighborhood watch volunteer accused of wrongly killing @entity3 , will not immediately have to turn over donations made to his website , a @entity1 judge said friday			1
@entity2 collected about $ 204,000 in donations through the website , but did not disclose the contributions during his bond hearing last week , according to his attorney , @entity9			1
prosecutors had asked for a bond of $ 1 million , but judge @entity12 made it $ 150,000 after @entity2 's family testified they did not have the resources necessary to meet the higher level			1
assistant state attorney @entity17 on friday asked @entity12 to increase the bond in light of the donations			1
but the judge said he would delay ruling on the request , in part because he does not know if he has authority to say how the money can be used			2
@entity12 and @entity9 both said they are concerned about releasing the names of donors to @entity2 , who has faced threats since the case began making national headlines in march			1
@entity2 , 28 , was released monday on $ 150,000 bail , 10 % of which was put up to secure his release while he awaits trial on a second - degree murder charge in @entity3 's february 26 death			1
about $ 5,000 from the website contribution was used in making bond , @entity9 said			2
the rest came from a loan secured by a family home			0
although @entity2 spent some of the contributions on living expenses , about $ 150,000 remains , @entity9 said friday			1
@entity9 said he has put the money into a trust he controls until a final decision is made about its use			0
@entity12 asked for additional information about the accounts but did not indicate when he would rule			2
" i 'm not going to make a snap decision , " the judge said			0
also during friday 's hearing , @entity12 declined to consider a gag order requested by prosecutors , saying it was premature and that none of the attorneys in the case had said anything to concern him so far			1
@entity63 was among the media organizations opposing the motion			0
@entity9 said he learned about the money this week as he and @entity2 were trying to shut down @entity2 's website , @entity69 page and @entity71 account to avoid concerns about possible impersonators and other problems			1
" he asked me what to do with his @entity78 accounts , and i asked him what he was talking about , " @entity9 told @entity63 's @entity75 on thursday			2
" he said those were the accounts that had the money from the website he had			0
and there was about ... $ 204,000 that had come in to date			0
" @entity9 had said earlier this month that he believed @entity2 had no money			2
asked whether knowledge of the money might have made a difference to @entity12 , who presided at @entity2 's bond hearing , @entity9 said , " it might have			1
" @entity9 could not explain why @entity2 did n't disclose the funds , but said he did n't think his client had meant to deceive anyone			2
" i consider it an oversight because i do n't see anything else that suggests that mr. @entity2 has been insincere or dishonest , " he told @entity63 's @entity95 on friday			1
" the moment i asked him about it , he acknowledged it and forwarded the money			0
" @entity3 family attorney @entity101 said @entity2 's failure to reveal that he had the money shows that he is being dishonest			1
" if his testimony at the bond hearing is any indication of what is to come , then the lying has already begun , " @entity101 said			0
" this is going to say a lot about whether @entity3 can get a fair trial , " he told @entity95			0
" if he ( @entity12 ) does n't revoke his bond , the court should severely sanction him so @entity2 understands you can not lie to the court			1
" separately , the attorney said the @entity3 family has raised less than $ 100,000 in fund - raising efforts to date , and that the money collected will go toward the @entity120			1
@entity101 said his firm will not collect a fee in any of the criminal proceedings			0
" if we collect any money , it will be from a civil lawsuit and not from any donor money , " he said			0
@entity2 was arrested april 11 after a lengthy delay punctuated by protests and rallies nationwide calling for charges against him			0
critics accuse @entity2 of racially profiling and unjustly killing @entity3 , a 17 - year - old @entity135			1
@entity2 told police he shot @entity3 in self - defense , according to police reports			1
although details of the shooting remain murky , it is known that @entity3 ventured out from the @entity142 , @entity1 , home of his father 's fiancee and went to a nearby convenience store , where he bought a bag of candy and an iced tea			2
on his way back , he had a confrontation with @entity2 , who shot him			0
@entity2 had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood , according to authorities			0
in the call , @entity2 said he was following @entity3 after the teen started to run , prompting the dispatcher to tell him , " we do n't need you to do that			1
" @entity2 pursued @entity3 anyway but then said he lost sight of him			1
according to an @entity163 story later confirmed by @entity142 police , @entity2 told authorities that after he briefly lost track of @entity3 , the teen approached him			2
after the two exchanged words , @entity2 said , he reached for his cell phone , and then @entity3 punched him in the nose			2
@entity2 said @entity3 pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head onto the sidewalk , leading to the shooting			2
police have said @entity2 was not immediately charged because there was no evidence to disprove his account that he 'd acted in self - defense			1
