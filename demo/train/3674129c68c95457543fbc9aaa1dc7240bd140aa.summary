-- @entity1 suffered his first ever home defeat in the @entity3 as @entity4 slumped to a 2 - 1 loss to bottom side @entity6 at @entity8 on saturday			1
the @entity12 manager 's remarkable 77 - match unbeaten record which covers both his spells at the west @entity15 club was ended when former @entity4 player @entity16 scored an 82nd - minute winner			1
the @entity18 , who is currently on loan to @entity6 from league leaders @entity21 , slotted home from the penalty spot after @entity25 had been adjudged to have fouled @entity26 by referee @entity27			2
the decision incensed @entity4 assistant coach @entity29 who angrily confronted @entity27 before being sent to the stands			2
after squandering two points at @entity34 in midweek , @entity32 's side were n't about to make the same mistake twice and gamely held on for the win despite concerted pressure from the home side			2
the win is n't enough to lift @entity6 off the foot of the table but it does move them to within one point of @entity44 and @entity45 who each have 30 points and have played one game extra			1
earlier , @entity50 had put the @entity51 ahead steering home neatly from a corner in the 12th minute before @entity54 scored his third goal in two matches six minutes later -- the 21 - year - old firing home after goalkeeper @entity58 had spilled @entity60 's speculative shot			1
despite enjoying almost two thirds of possession , @entity4 failed to find a way through @entity6 's defenses converting just one of their 31 scoring opportunities			1
the @entity51 ' third league defeat in six matches leaves them two points adrift of leaders @entity21 who can move five points clear if they beat @entity72 on sunday			2
@entity1 has been insisting for some time that his team are not favorites for the title and now his pessimistic predictions are perhaps coming true			2
he was n't taking questions on that subject or any others following saturday 's loss , choosing instead to issue a brusque statement			0
" i just want to say four things , and i 'm sorry , because if you make me ( answer ) more questions , i will repeat in exactly the same way , " a dejected @entity1 told @entity82			2
" congratulations to my players , because they gave what they have and what they do n't have			0
congratulations to @entity6 , because they won			2
congratulations to @entity27 , because he made a fantastic performance			0
" and congratulations to @entity99 ( the man in charge of @entity3 referees ) , because what they did during the season was fantastic for the way the championship is going			0
" so congratulations to all of them , and i have nothing more to say			0
" when @entity1 has prized his tongue out from his cheek he will have the task of getting his players ready for tuesday 's @entity112 semifinal first leg at @entity113			2
after that , there is the small matter of a league trip to @entity21 next weekend			0
in the remaining @entity3 matches @entity118 beat @entity45 3 - 1 at @entity119			1
back - to - back wins in their last two matches had given the @entity124 hope of avoiding the drop but saturday 's defeat keeps them second - from - bottom , two points from safety with only three games remaining			1
spurs , meanwhile , remain sixth with 63 points from 35 games			0
fellow strugglers @entity44 drew 1 - 1 with @entity134 to move up to 18th in the table while @entity136 and @entity137 played out a goalless draw			1

two first - half goals from @entity159 -- one from open play in the fourth minute , the other a 32nd - minute penalty -- handed the @entity164 leaders the advantage before @entity167 56th - minute goal halved the deficit			0
@entity170 's side held on against the side they lost to in the league last weekend to clinch what will likely be a cup and league double -- @entity154 are currently 10 points clear of @entity177 in @entity164 with five games remaining			0
