-- hundreds of state troopers and police from throughout the country stood at attention outside a @entity6 church thursday to mourn cpl. @entity7 amid concerns that a survivalist and war buff suspected of gunning down two troopers may be on the hunt for more officers			1
the @entity14 , meanwhile , placed shooting suspect @entity15 on its @entity16 and offered a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest			1
as bagpipes played a mournful tune outside @entity23 in @entity24 , a small army of troopers stood at attention out of respect for the 38 - year - old former marine			0
a @entity31 honor guard displayed @entity33 colors and the @entity34			0
church bells rang slowly as six troopers carried @entity7 's coffin out of the church and into a silver hearse , followed by the slain officer 's young sons , @entity42 and @entity43 , and his wife @entity44			1
earlier , the rev. @entity45 , the @entity46 chaplain , told the congregation , " we gather here in sorrow , disbelief and anger			0
but most importantly we gather here in faith			0
" @entity45 said " @entity42 's life was truly a gift from @entity57 himself			1
" " you can remember him and only that he is gone , " @entity45 said , " or cherish his memory and let it live on			0
" " although our hearts today are heavy with grief , may we celebrate a life well - lived and find peace as we remember the many happy and special times that we shared with our fellow brother , " he said			2
" may we believe that he is in a place where he will continue to watch over us as we move forward			0
" police continue to search for the man who killed @entity7 and wounded another trooper last friday , officials said			1
on thursday , authorities said they believe the suspect is still in the area			2
@entity15 is a survivalist with an extensive shooting background and a grudge against law enforcement , officials said			1
@entity15 apparently cut his hair into a mohawk style before the attack on police and was active in a military simulation unit that re-enacted @entity88 - era @entity87 conflicts			1
@entity15 is the 503rd person to be placed on the @entity14 's @entity89			1
his @entity14 most - wanted poster describes him as a " heavy smoker , a weapons enthusiast , and a survivalist			1
he claims to have fought with @entity94 in @entity95 , and he has studied @entity97 and @entity94 languages			0
" @entity6 state police commissioner @entity98 said wednesday investigators are trying to determine why @entity15 may have attacked in the small , central @entity6 town of @entity101			1
but they know that , generally , @entity15 " has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder , " @entity102 said			1
" he has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society			1
" police say he 's responsible for the chaotic , bloody scene friday night at the state police barracks in @entity101 , @entity6			1
@entity6 state police lt. col. @entity117 said @entity15 has an apparent fascination with @entity87 armies , their history and attire			1
his simulation group -- which @entity117 declined to name -- would stage re-enactments using airsoft guns			1
in this case , though , authorities say @entity15 is using live ammunition and shooting to kill			1
" it is believed that @entity15 has assumed the simulation role , and is now acting it out in real life , " @entity117 said			1
@entity117 said @entity15 has " his head shaved on the sides with long hair on top , " wider than a " mohawk " haircut , apparently as part of his mental preparation for his attacks on the troopers			1
the hairstyle is " completely different from what he had worn for years			0
in words directed at @entity15 , @entity117 was blunt			2
" if you are cowering in some cool damp place , " @entity117 said , " we are coming for you			0
it is only a matter of time until we bring you to justice for committing these cowardly acts			0
" nearly 200 officers are scouring eastern @entity6 for @entity15			1
the manhunt prompted area schools to close wednesday			2
until @entity15 is caught , no one is letting their guard down			2
@entity117 said @entity15 has had a " longstanding gripe with law enforcement and government in general " since at least 2006 and will likely " stay focused on that fight			1
" @entity117 said he thinks @entity15 is likely still in the general area			2
' get him inside ' cpl. @entity7 was just ending his shift around 11:50 p.m. friday when he walked out the station 's front door			2
he barely made it outside when a gunman shot him multiple times , a probable cause affidavit said			0
another officer , who saw @entity7 on the ground , came outside to help , the affidavit said			0
but as @entity7 told her what happened , another shot pierced the air			0
according to the documents , @entity7 asked his colleague to " get him inside			0
" but she could n't			0
at about the same time , a third officer headed in to start his overnight shift			0
but as trooper @entity186 walked toward the front door , he , too , was shot , the affidavit said			2
while @entity186 managed to crawl into the station , other officers had to devise a plan to safely move @entity7 inside			2
they swooped into the front of the building in a marked suv to block troopers as they brought @entity7 into the building			0
but it was too late			0
@entity7 was declared dead at the station			0
@entity186 was rushed to a hospital in @entity24 and is recovering from a gunshot wound to the pelvic area			0
authorities have been looking for @entity15 since			2
they have n't found him			0
but , on monday morning , a man walking his dog in a wooded area of @entity206 noticed a green jeep slightly submerged in a retention pond , according to the affidavit			0
as he walked closer , he noticed no one was inside			0
but when troopers executed a search warrant , they found a cache of items inside : two spent .308 cartridge casings , camouflage face paint , military gear and information concerning foreign embassies , the affidavit said			2
they also found @entity15 's driver 's license and social security card			1
a survivalist by hobby @entity15 , 31 , is a survivalist by hobby who lives in @entity231 , authorities said			1
@entity102 said anyone who spots @entity15 or knows something about him , should contact authorities right away			2
a friend of the suspect described @entity15 as " a pretty rational guy			1
" " he 's intelligent			2
when people say that he 's a survivalist , there 's almost somewhat of a negative connotation to that , " the friend , who wanted to be identified only as " @entity239 , " told @entity0 's @entity240			2
" he definitely let his opinions about the government be known , " @entity239 said			0
" he was obviously a big critic of the federal government , but he never specifically targeted police when he was talking to me			0
no indications of really any malice towards law enforcement in particular			1
most of his aggression was ( toward ) the federal government			0
" @entity15 's father told authorities that two firearms were missing from the family 's house , including an @entity262 and a rifle			1
the father said his son grew up with guns and was a member of his high school 's rifle club			0
when @entity15 shoots , his father told authorities , he " does n't miss. " @entity0 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report			1
