i 'm about to fly from @entity1 to @entity2 , and i 'm terrified			1
once in @entity2 , i will teach a class on creativity based on my book " @entity6			1
" while i am eager to share my toolkit with a new audience , i am not eager to fly			1
for a week before flying , i sleep poorly , " rotisserie - ing " in my fears			1
my friends notice that i am miserable			1
when i tell them i have a fear of flying , they respond , " but flying 's safe			1
safer than driving to the airport			1
" their rational reassurance does nothing to curb my fear			1
my mind spools out dire scenarios : the plane will have difficulty on takeoff or landing ; an engine will fail or catch fire ; a terrorist will somehow make it through security and reroute the plane like 9/11			1
for days before i am due to fly , i tell myself to pack			1
but my mind freezes at the prospect			1
finally , i make a list of everything i need to take			1
item by item , i pack			1
how easy it would be to pack a bomb , i think			1
i try to push this aside , but it persists			1
not flying is n't an option as an author who teaches seminars , i have flown for years			1
with more teaching came more flying and with more flying , an ever - increasing fear			1
i have never had anything bad happen when i was flying , as far as i know			1
my worst scenario about five years ago involved terrible turbulence			2
as the plane shimmied and shook , i clutched my armrests and prayed , " @entity51 , please end this turbulence			2
please let us find smooth air			2
" my prayers were earnest but went unanswered			1
the turbulence continued for nearly the whole flight			2
" how was your fight ? " my host asked , meeting me at the airport			1
really turbulent , " i replied			2
" well , you made it safe and sound , " my host said , glossing over my terror			2
" we 're glad you 're here			2
" a familiar feeling takes hold in four days , i would have to fly again , returning home			2
i put this return trip out of my mind , focusing on my days of teaching			2
there were tools to teach and anecdotes to share			2
my fear of flying had no place in the curriculum			1
it was n't until i was driving to the airport days later that i felt my familiar fear taking hold			1
" it went well , " said my host			2
" i hope you 'll come back next year			2
" i smiled politely , remembering my turbulent trip			2
i certainly did n't want to repeat it			2
as we approached the airport , i lost my ability for polite conversation			2
" @entity91 got your tongue ? " my host asked			2
" i 'm afraid of flying , " i reluctantly confessed			1
" very afraid of flying			1
" my host repeated the usual reassurance : " why , flying is safer than our driving to the airport			1
" " i know that , " i said , " but it does n't help			2
" and it did n't			2
the flight home was smooth , but i was braced for turbulence			2
i spent a long three hours dreading the bumps that did not come			2
an inspiration fueled by fear when i got home safely , my publisher called			1
" tell me your teaching went well ? " he asked			0
" it did , " i said			0
" it 's the flying that 's hard			1
" " why , flying is safer than driving to the airport , " he assured me			1
" i know , i know , " i said			0
" my fear is n't rational			1
i think it has to do with not having control			0
flying , you put your life in your pilot 's hands			1
that takes an act of faith			0
" " why do n't you write me a little book on the fear of flying , " he asked			1
" maybe writing would help you			0
" who wants to confess an irrational fear , much less in print ? " i feel like such a baby , " i complained to my friends			1
but i agreed to do it , and an assignment was an assignment			0
and as the time neared for my next flight , i found myself watching my fear with a new objectivity			1
afraid to even pack , i prayed for the willingness to begin			0
making my packing list , i felt calmer			0
executing it early , i felt good			1
" maybe there 's something to be said for prayer , " i caught myself thinking			1
writing down specific prayers and so i wrote out prayers for each step of my journey , asking in particular for freedom from turbulence			1
determined to fly fearlessly , i asked for help			0
unlike my neighbors on the flight , i did not order a drink or take a pill			0
and when i did so , i felt an unfamiliar calm stealing over me			0
my neighbor noticed my calm			0
" what are you doing ? " i was asked through a double scotch			0
" i 'm praying , " i said			0
" i 'm drinking , " said my neighbor			0
" teach me to pray			0
" and so , i led a prayer and then another			0
my neighbor exclaimed , " i do feel better ! " my mind ticked back to my assignment			0
i thought of the prayers i use			1
you do not need to believe in anything specific			0
even if you do n't believe , acting as if you do can bring you calm			0
before takeoff prayer @entity51 , please help our pilot			0
please help me to trust his wisdom and skill			0
please help me to let go			0
let our flight be smooth and uneventful			0
let us land without mishaps			0
prayer for turbulence @entity51 , please guide us to smooth air			0
please , please , end this turbulence			0
quiet my nerves and give me faith			0
thank you for your help			0
landing prayer @entity51 , please give us a safe landing			0
please see that the gears work smoothly			0
lock them firmly into place			0
let us hear the mechanisms working			0
let us trust the hydraulics			0
one more calming suggestion using my tips to pray , pack early and tell myself to postpone my fear until tomorrow ( when i tell myself to postpone it again ) , i recently took a trip to @entity197			1
that entailed eleven hours of airtime , almost all of it turbulent			0
instead of my usual fear , i found myself trusting our pilot and our plane			1
i visualized each bump like a wave on water			0
while not relaxed enough to sleep , i was relaxed enough to read			0
this brought me to another tip : buy tabloids			0
celebrity cellulite can make you forget turbulence .			0

knowing flying is safer than driving has never calmed @entity219 's fear of flying
instead of running away from her fears , @entity219 wrote prayers to address them
" @entity6 " author also packs early and buys certain *magazines* to help fight fear
