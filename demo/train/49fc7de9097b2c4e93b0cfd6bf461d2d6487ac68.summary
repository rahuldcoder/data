-- a " tricky " @entity2 , disgruntled crowds and torrents of mud washing away tents , @entity1 has had to deal with them all			1
the @entity8 dj turned festival impresario is the man behind the @entity11 music festival and despite the challenges of putting on the annual event , his love of festivals remains undiminished			1
@entity11 was " a happy accident " says @entity1 ( real name @entity1 )			1
he explains that he fell into first putting on the event in 2004 as his weekly club night in a pub in @entity20 grew in popularity and requests for bigger and longer events increased			2
@entity11 now attracts 50,000 people and top acts -- this year the @entity26 are the headline band -- and is one of the most popular events in the musical calendar			1
for three days each year the invasion of the sleepy @entity32 off the south coast of @entity34 by bands , fans and leftfield festival attractions increases the island 's population by over 30 percent			2
a desire to get back to the " boutique " feel of its earlier days lead to the birth of @entity11 's little sister , @entity11 , in 2008			1
it 's a much smaller and more family - friendly affair , but at the heart of both events is @entity1 's desire to put on " a good fun party with a top musical line - up			1
" @entity0 talked to @entity1 about his best and worst festival moments			1
what was your first festival experience ? " @entity57 about 20 years ago , in 1991 , i think			2
it was n't like i grew up in the back of a tee - pee or was a hippie child taken around festivals			2
i was a student and it was when @entity57 was really exploding			0
it really changed my life , which sounds like a clich√© , but it opened my eyes to a completely different kind of life			0
i knew i always wanted to go to festivals and it 's a total part of our lives now			2
" what 's your favorite festival memory ? " there are so many things ; from getting engaged at @entity57 to opening the gates at the first @entity11 to @entity80 headlining a few years ago			1
sorry , that 's three and not one			0
" what 's your worst festival moment ? " it was n't awful , but the most tricky and stressful was the wet year ( in 2008 ) , when we had ten inches of rain in a day , the most rain the @entity32 had for 100 years			1
it was a struggle and we kept it open and everyone seemed to get through it just about			0
those things test you and you come out stronger			0
" what 's been you favorite act ? " in terms of at @entity11 , as well as @entity80 , @entity93 put on an amazing show a few years ago			1
they actually played two shows and were there all weekend			0
i love it when acts stick around and actually become part of the festival			2
" who was the most difficult performer you 've had to deal with ? " @entity2 was tricky ; she was right in the thick of all her troubles and she was very late getting on site and there was a lot of tension in the crowd as to whether she would turn up or not			1
she had to be shuttled off the island in a blanket with two security guards			0
there was a lot of @entity119 and it was just funny hi - jinx			0
" what do you always take to a festival ? " a wife is a good way of keeping a lid on things , because i get over-excited at festivals and run riot from the moment i get there			1
festivals now start on the thursday or friday , so if i 'm not tethered i 'll peak on the thursday lunchtime and miss the weekend			2
so @entity134 is an essential			0
" apart from that a bin bag ; it can be a sun shade , a water - proof , something to take your rubbish home in or something to sit on in the mud			0
" do you have any favorite non-music festivals or ones you 'd like to go to ? " i 've been to the @entity145 , literary festivals and umpteen carnivals and village things in @entity149 and @entity150			0
i 'd love to go to the tomato festival in @entity150 or some of the more non-music crazy offerings			0
i 'm going to @entity153 in @entity154 ... it sounds fairly off the hook so i 'm looking forward to that			0
