@entity0 , @entity1 -- one of @entity1 's most famous soccer clubs has been sold to the @entity5 owners of baseball 's @entity6 following a protracted @entity9 legal battle			2
@entity10 , the head of @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , confirmed in @entity0 friday that the company 's $ 480 million deal to buy @entity14 had finally been completed			1
@entity14 's previous owners @entity16 and @entity17 , who are also @entity5 , earlier withdrew their temporary restraining order blocking the sale , having twice gone to a court in @entity21 to prevent the transaction			1
" i ca n't tell you how happy i am that we finally got to this stage , " @entity10 told a throng of reporters			2
" we 're going to do a lot of listening			2
we have a lot to learn , but our actions will hopefully speak louder than words			0
" @entity14 takeover saga explained the deal eliminates the @entity36 club 's debt obligation -- believed to be around $ 377 million -- to the club 's main creditor , the @entity37 ( @entity37 )			1
crucially , this will prevent the club 's holding company , @entity40 , from going into administration , the @entity44 equivalent of bankruptcy			0
this carries a nine - point penalty for @entity36 clubs , and could have led to relegation from the top flight given the club 's poor start to the season			0
@entity14 chairman @entity53 , whom @entity16 and @entity17 hired to find a buyer , said in a statement : " i am delighted that we have been able to successfully conclude the sale process which has been thorough and extensive			1

@entity11 is buying @entity14 in order to put it on an excellent financial footing and continue to develop it internationally			1
" this is a good deal which comprehensively resolves the pressing issue of the @entity14 's debt and should give staff , players and fans great confidence regarding the future of @entity14 " from the frying pan into the fire for @entity14 ? meanwhile , @entity16 and @entity17 are now planning a $ 1.6 billion damages action , claiming the sale is " illegal			1
" a statement on behalf of the pair read : " it 's an extraordinary swindle and it will result in exactly the wrong thing for the club and the fans			0
" @entity37 , which had set a friday deadline for @entity16 and @entity17 to repay the loan used to finance their 2007 purchase of @entity14 , said any legal action by the pair " will be vigorously opposed			1
" " @entity37 is pleased the sale to @entity11 has been completed and is confident this will provide the foundation for the club and its fans to enjoy renewed success on and off the pitch , " the bank said in a statement			1
" @entity37 is aware of reports that mr. @entity16 and mr. @entity17 may intend to pursue further litigation in relation to the sale of @entity14			1
the @entity1 courts have described claims made to date as " not realistic and abusive			0
" any further claims against @entity37 will be vigorously opposed			2
" history of @entity14 in images earlier friday , @entity16 was believed to be trying to offload his shares in the club to a @entity5 hedge fund which already controls @entity17 's 50 percent ownership , @entity44 's @entity107 said			1
however , the @entity36 , which oversees the game in @entity1 , rejected @entity115 's requests to undergo a fit and proper person test , saying it could only negotiate with the @entity14 board , the @entity112 reported			2
the board , headed by @entity53 , approved the deal with @entity11 last week without the consent of @entity16 and @entity17 as a way to rescue the club from its financial problems			1
but the pair said through their lawyers that superior offers had been " on the table and were not chosen			0
" a subsequent bid to veto the sale was rejected by a @entity0 court , before @entity16 and @entity17 obtained the restraining order in a @entity21 court on wednesday in an effort to delay the deal			1
on thursday the case was taken to a @entity0 court for a second time , but @entity1 judge mr. justice @entity139 said the move by @entity16 and @entity17 amounted to " unconscionable conduct , " and granted anti-suit injunctions to nullify decisions taken in @entity21			1
the @entity5 duo were given until 1500 gmt ( 1100 est ) on friday to comply with the ruling			0
@entity10 , meanwhile , had pledged to fight @entity16 ' " last desperate attempt " to hang on to @entity14			1
" we have a binding contract , " he wrote on his @entity147 account late thursday			0
" will fight @entity151 attempt to keep club today			0
their last desperate attempt to entrench their regime			0
" @entity11 promised that if its offer was successful , it would keep all acquisition debts away from @entity14 's football operations and stabilize the club in order to return it to its glory days			2
one win in seven games has left the team 18th in the 20 - team @entity36 table in the early stages of the season , and at risk of possible relegation in may unless results improve			0
the club faces one of its biggest matches of the season this sunday against city rivals @entity175			0
the club has earned a joint record of 18 @entity1 titles -- but none since 1990			0
