@entity0 , @entity1 -- the message the brother and sister read aloud is one addressed to a missing father : 9 - year - old @entity7 and 8 - year - old @entity8 reciting the words in unison , " our mother 's starting to worry about you			1
" their mom , @entity14 , is indeed worried , but she 's also pained			2
she knows how much her children yearn to see their dad , but she just does n't know what to tell them			2
how can she begin to explain that their dad has languished in a @entity20 prison for almost a year ? how can she expose her kids to a brutal reality she feels they 're not ready to face ? " they 're always asking me , ' when is @entity25 coming home ? ' " @entity23 said			1
" telling me , ' @entity27 , i miss @entity25 so much			2
' " @entity23 struggles with the dilemma every day			2
" it often feels like the world is against me , " she said			2
" when i see how the children are deprived of their father , this is what bothers me the most			2
" her three children , including 5 - year - old @entity37 , think their father 's just delayed by work			2
but @entity39 , 30 , has been imprisoned since being arrested in june			1
he is accused of , among other things , breaking @entity42 law and starting a website that infringed on religious values			1
according to @entity23 , her husband just wanted to encourage discussion about religion in his homeland			2
but starting a liberal internet forum in conservative @entity20 can be a dangerous pursuit			1
" no one wanted to take his case , " said @entity52 , @entity39 's attorney			2
" because they believed that anyone who 'd take this kind of case , that means he destroys his ( own ) reputation			0
but i do n't believe in that			0
i believe that everyone has his right to have a lawyer			0
and i believe that @entity39 is innocent			0
" @entity52 is more than just @entity39 's attorney			0
he 's also his brother - in - law and a fellow human - rights activist also on trial in @entity20			1
talking over @entity69 because he 's been banned from traveling outside @entity20 , @entity52 describes how he 's been accused of " speaking to the foreign media with the intention of harming the country 's reputation			1
" he said any activist who calls for reform there is in danger of being arrested			0
rights groups agree , accusing @entity20 authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans			1
many were outraged when two of the country 's most prominent reform advocates , @entity87 and @entity88 , were recently sentenced to 10 years in prison apiece			1
@entity90 called that trial " just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom 's human - rights activists			1
" " here 's the thing , " @entity52 said			0
" the government of @entity20 , they want to show themselves outside @entity20 that they are modern , that they are open - minded , that they want to change , they want to reform , that the problem is coming from the society , and that the society moves slowly			1
they keep saying that for the foreign media			0
" but actually inside , when we act with our society , when we want to reform , when we want to do something with our society , they keep punishing us			0
" @entity2 has made several attempts to reach @entity20 's @entity109 ministries for comment but received no response			1
asked in january about accusations that @entity20 is cracking down on dissent , maj. gen. @entity112 , spokesman for the @entity20 @entity113 , told @entity2 , " at the @entity113 , our area of responsibility is security			1
" he added , " my understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now			1
nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts			1
" @entity39 's legal troubles started shortly after he started the @entity126 website in 2008			0
he was detained for one day and questioned about the site			0
some clerics even branded him an unbeliever and apostate			0
according to @entity23 , she and @entity39 began receiving death threats			0
fearing for their and their children 's lives , they planned to move the family out of @entity20 in 2009			1
that was before they discovered @entity39 had been placed under a travel ban and that his business interests had been frozen , depriving them of a source of income			1
in july , @entity144 released a statement urging @entity20 authorities to free @entity39			1
" @entity20 authorities should drop charges and release the editor of the @entity126 website for violating his right to freedom of expression on matters of religion and religious figures , " a statement from the group said			1
today , @entity23 lives in @entity1 with the kids			1
she feels safer , but life 's become a lot lonelier			0
estranged from her family , @entity23 said it would be impossible to take her children back to @entity20			1
the stigma is too strong there			0
" you feel like everybody 's accusing you , " she said , close to tears			0
" like everybody 's against you , at war with you			0
" according to @entity52 , the @entity20 government has little tolerance for activists who speak out			1
" they did n't punish just ( @entity39 ) , " @entity52 said , describing how @entity39 and those closest to him have effectively been ostracized			1
" they punish his family			1
actually , they punish their future			0
" @entity52 said that even if @entity39 is eventually released from prison , his future has been ruined			2
" they destroyed his image in our society ( by saying ) that he 's against our @entity187 , " @entity52 said			0
@entity52 said @entity39 fears he 'll be kept in prison indefinitely			2
" what he 's afraid of , " he said , " is that they just want to keep him in prison without judgment for a long time , like what 's happened now			2
ten months without any judgment			0
they just moved his case from a court to another court to keep him in jail for a long time			0
" @entity23 misses her husband more with each passing day , but she said all she can do is wait			0
her children 's questions become ever more pressing as she grows more desperate			0
" at the end of the day , you find there 's nobody to give you hope , " she said			0
" everybody is silent about the case			0

rights groups say @entity20 authorities are targeting activists through the courts , travel bans
@entity217 has been in prison since june , charged with violating @entity42 law
his family has been effectively ostracized , waits for him in @entity1
