@entity0 -- police in @entity0 and @entity3 dismantled tents and arrested occupy protesters who refused to leave city property early wednesday			1
@entity0 police moved in at 12:30 a.m. about an hour later , the @entity8 lawn was cleared and closed for cleanup			1
about 200 people were arrested in the operation , which utilized some 1,400 officers , said police chief @entity13			1
police described the operation as fairly peaceful , and mayor @entity15 early wednesday praised officers ' professionalism			1
the @entity0 encampment , which has been in place for some 60 days , had become the largest one remaining after police raided @entity22 's @entity21 on november 15 and dismantled the nearly two - month - old camp there			1
in @entity3 , 52 people were arrested , said police spokeswoman @entity26			1
the evictions at @entity8 came about 1 a.m. , @entity3 mayor @entity27 said in a statement			1
scuffles broke out after police ordered some protesters to clear the street , @entity1 affiliate @entity30 said			1
@entity26 said police remained at the scene wednesday , and the plaza was being cleaned			1
@entity30 reported several streets were closed until further notice			2
four people were injured , @entity27 said in the written statement			1
one police officer sustained a shoulder injury , another cut his hand while making arrests , and a third cut his leg while taking down a tent			1
a protester was injured when a police horse stepped on her toe , @entity26 said , and was taken to a hospital			1
on monday , @entity27 gave protesters camped at @entity8 a 48 - hour notice to vacate the site , citing a pending construction project			1
with the @entity0 and @entity3 evictions , occupy encampments remained in a handful of cities including @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity66 ; and @entity67 , according to media reports and websites set up by the movement in some cities			1
in @entity0 , officers in riot gear and armed with batons closed off streets around @entity72 , using bullhorns to warn scores of agitated @entity76 protesters to disperse			1
" this has been declared to be an unlawful assembly			2
you have seven minutes to gather your belongings and decide to leave , " one officer said			2
during the raid , more than a dozen protesters sat in a tight circle in the middle of the park with their arms linked			2
a white police truck drove through the center of the park , announcing orders to disperse in @entity96 and @entity97			1
one carried a skateboard under one arm and what looked like a rolled - up sleeping bag in the other			2
officers were met with profanity but no violence			0
" this is what a police state looks like ! " some of the protesters chanted			1
@entity15 said the police action was " a measured approach to enforcing the park closure			1
" on sunday , he gave the group a 12:01 a.m. monday deadline to take down their camp , saying " an encampment on @entity72 grounds is simply not sustainable indefinitely			0
" but the protesters held their ground			0
four people were arrested , but police pulled back			1
the demonstrators sought a federal court injunction to block their removal , claiming that enforcement of the city 's " anti-camping " provision is left up to the whim of the police			2
the @entity132 has " expressly affirmed " that the demonstrators are within their first amendment rights , their complaint said , and @entity15 , in ordering them to leave , overstepped his authority			0
the case remained pending wednesday			0
in announcing the wednesday police raid , the mayor said the park will be closed , and then reopened to " all @entity141 to exercise their first amendment rights			1
" the protesters are welcome back , but they can not camp out -- the same arrangement as at @entity22 's @entity21			0
the @entity145 movement that began in @entity22 in september has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against the unequal distribution of wealth			0
in recent weeks , cities have begun clearing encampments , citing economic , health and public safety concerns			0
while only a handful of protesters remained at @entity21 , hundreds meet on a regular basis in the atrium of a building on @entity160			0
one problem faced by the occupy movement is that its tactics " are really costly to themselves , " meaning its members , said @entity166 , a @entity167 professor who studies social movements			0
" basically what they 've done is , they 've built a movement around a tactic that requires a high level of commitment on the part of its members " in terms of arrests and legal action or perhaps having their property confiscated			0
that tactic -- camping in public spaces -- can succeed for a while , he said , " but the police will inevitably crack down			2
" in order to survive , he said , the @entity187 needs to adopt some other tactics in order to change the system through internal pressure , not just external pressure , he said			0
those might include lobbying , for instance			0
the civil rights movement , he said , used tactics such as marches and sit - ins , but also formulated a legal strategy and lobbied for the @entity203			0
but in the @entity187 , it 's precisely the current tactic that has inspired people , he said , making it tough for the movement to reorient itself			2
in addition , members have ideological reasons to reject alternative tactics , he said			0
" the people that are at the heart of the @entity187 are more committed to their way of organizing than they are to achieving the policy goals they say they support , " @entity166 said			2
" ... they care more about doing social action in the way they want to do it , " meaning a non-hierarchical , " leaderless " approach			0
in addition , he noted , policy change in the @entity226 can take decades -- allowing gays and lesbians to serve in the military , for example			0
" in order to achieve policy change , you need institutions and interests committed over a period of several decades to bringing about those changes			0
" still , the occupy movement has been " the most successful anarchist movement in history , " he said , and is able to organize people effectively			2
but , he said , it 's hard to see a clear path to its next stage			0
