@entity0 , @entity1 -- do n't be surprised if , any day now , you read that the @entity4 of @entity5 is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end , once and for all , to illegal immigration on its southern border			1
after all , it 's the next logical step for the rogue state			0
this week , to advance the narrative that @entity5 has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch , @entity5 gov. @entity13 called for air support			1
@entity13 requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the @entity22 to patrol the border region with @entity24			0
in a letter to president @entity26 , @entity13 asked that the @entity27 reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the " border states " to prevent illegal immigration			1
the governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones , including possibly the predator drones used in @entity36 and @entity37			2
in fact , in her letter , @entity13 even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective			0
what 's the matter with @entity5 ? is n't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke ? i guess this is par for the course			1
@entity13 just signed @entity53 , a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial - profiling law , to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent			0
why should n't she get the chance to suit up and play general ? after all , like the @entity64 , @entity5 is currently involved in two wars			1
there 's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that @entity72 would n't do			1
and then there 's the rhetorical war with the @entity26 administration , which @entity5 wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration , which forced @entity72 to take matters into their own hands			1
the argument that the federal government is n't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless			2
it is dishonest because it 's not true			0
i 've visited the @entity64 - @entity24 border a dozen times in the past 10 years : in @entity88 , @entity5 and @entity1			1
i 've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors			0
i 've also been up in a @entity92 helicopter flying above the border , which offers a unique perspective on border security			1
so i can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you : the @entity64 - @entity24 border has never been more fortified			1
there are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll			0
that 's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency , including the @entity106			2
those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip			0
in fact , it was recently announced that the @entity26 administration deported more people last year than the @entity115 administration during its final year in office			2
it is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge , as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the @entity122 of the @entity123 by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law			0
and that 's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado			0
in fact , it might not be a bad idea for @entity5 officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they 're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement , since that 's a no - no under the @entity123			1
if the federal government does take border enforcement seriously , critics might ask : why are there still people trying to enter the @entity64 illegally ? simple			2
we can dig a moat , deploy an army , build walls or call in an airstrike , but desperate people will always find a way to go around , under or over any impediment in their path to a better life			0
this is n't to condone illegal immigration			1
my views -- in support of deportations , workplace raids , giving more resources to the @entity92 etc. -- are well known			0
i 'm just telling you what @entity92 agents tell me : that it does n't make any sense to focus all our attention at the border while turning a blind eye to employers in the interior			2
that 's like trying to fill a bucket with teaspoons of water without first plugging the hole at the bottom			0
now @entity26 has fallen into that same trap			2
he is reportedly ready to announce that he is sending 1,200 @entity27 troops to the @entity64 - @entity24 border to help control illegal immigration and quell some of the violence			1
that 's a far cry from the 6,000 troops that @entity5 sen. @entity187 had requested , and congressional @entity188 seem miffed that @entity26 stole their thunder			1
still , as long as the troops follow the protocol laid out in 2006 when @entity115 launched @entity192 -- that they 're unarmed and act only in a support capacity to the @entity92 by fixing vehicles , monitoring surveillance equipment , repairing fences -- i think sending the @entity27 is a fine idea			1
it 's just not the magic bullet that the most enthusiastic proponents of the idea would have us believe			0
there 's only one of those			0
it involves fining , arresting and prosecuting the employers of illegal immigrants , including people who are , this election year , streaming into fundraisers for @entity187 , @entity13 and other tough - talking republicans vowing to solve a problem that many of their backers helped create			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219			0

@entity5 has asked for *military* equipment , including drones , to beef up border security
president @entity26 has *approved* sending @entity27 to the border
@entity219 says border has never been more *protected* , but it 's not the real issue
he says *culprit* in illegal immigration is employers who hire illegals to do jobs @entity64 wo n't do
