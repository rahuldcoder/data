-- across @entity2 , middle - class families are wondering how they 'll send their kids to college , pay their mortgages and still manage to save enough for retirement			1
women across @entity2 face an uphill climb in the workplace , as they continue to earn less than men			0
we still sit in traffic on congested roads built decades ago , and then drive on run - down roads and crumbling bridges			2
these are among the problems our elected leaders are expected to address			0
these are the issues voters want us to focus on			0
but those are not the issues that the @entity2 people will remember as the priorities of @entity25 and the 113th @entity26			1
instead , @entity28 @entity27 have been focused on anything but strengthening the middle class			1
under @entity25 as speaker , they have hopscotched from issue to issue , not to govern , but in the hopes of finding the silver bullet to motivate their base to elect them -- because they know that they will lose on one crucial issue : the economy			2
@entity25 and leading @entity27 have said over and over that this election is about : the @entity41 , the @entity42 , @entity43 , immigration -- and the list goes on			1
the headlines alone tell the story : 11/18/13 : @entity48 ( @entity49 ) 1/31/14 : @entity27 turn up @entity41 rhetoric as elections loom ( @entity52 ) 3/21/14 : republicans @entity53 on @entity48 for 2014 ( @entity55 ) 5/08/14 : @entity28 @entity27 pursue @entity43 inquiry going into midterm campaigns ( @entity58 ) 5/27/14 : @entity59 on @entity60 ( @entity61 ) 8/24/14 : republicans @entity63 ( @entity64 ) 9/23/14 : @entity27 think the @entity65 is their winning issue ( @entity66 ) but there is one constant that the @entity2 will remember about the 113th @entity26 : @entity25 and the tea party shut down our government			1
that shutdown , a year ago this week , eventually cost our economy $ 24 billion and hurt millions of people across the country			0
and while @entity2 were sent home from work , were denied health care treatment , and , in the case of veterans , had their benefits delayed , @entity27 members of @entity26 kept getting paid on time and did n't even need to take a break from going to the taxpayer - funded congressional gym			1
across the country , @entity2 have already started casting votes for the 114th @entity26			2
those voters now have the chance to decide whether they support candidates who put special interests ahead of working moms			0
they can decide whether they want leaders who think women should be able to make their own choices about their health care			0
voters will be casting their ballots knowing which candidate will have their back and which one will have the back of special interests			0
and they will remember the standout moment from this @entity26 : that @entity104 , who could not work together with other lawmakers on solutions , went for a shutdown instead			2
in the 114th @entity26 , @entity28 @entity109 will continue our focus on the @entity113 agenda , a plan built on the pillars of investing in infrastructure , making college more affordable and ensuring equal pay for equal work			1
ask a @entity120 what this election is about			0
he or she will tell you it 's about strengthening the economy for @entity2 's middle class -- exactly what voters want .			1

@entity130 : middle class worries about money , equal pay , crumbling infrastructure
he says @entity27 has not shown these are its priorities ; party instead *attacks* @entity140
he says @entity25 's @entity26 will be remembered for shutting down government in 2013
@entity144 : *democrats* running in 2014 will focus on the real priorities of the middle class
