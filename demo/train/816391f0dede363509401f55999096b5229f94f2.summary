@entity0 , @entity1 -- three and a half years ago , i ran a mile with nine men who were living at the @entity5 in @entity0 ,			1
wanting to start a running club at this homeless shelter came from passing this facility on my morning run and seeing a group of men congregating outside on the corner			1
i was quickly drawn to them as they reminded me a lot of my dad , who i love dearly but unfortunately has suffered from addiction to drugs , alcohol and gambling for much of his life			2
my dad and i have always had a very special , sarcastic rapport and one of the hardest things i have gone through was being a teenager and not being able to figure out a way to save my dad from his gambling addiction , which ended up tearing apart our family			2
@entity34 miners to attend @entity35 tribute to save myself from the despair , i ran a lot , and 10 years later is when i finally found the road that made my life make sense and it started with these nine guys			1
i thought in some spiritual cosmic way that i could vicariously help my dad by helping these men			2
it does n't matter whether you 're white , black , rich , poor , homeless or not			1
i wanted to share this sport with these guys in hopes they would reap the same benefits i did -- better self - esteem , confidence and discipline			2
but , it did n't take long to see that it was turning into so much more			2
an environment had been created where people , regardless of race , religion or socio - economic status , were treated with respect , appreciation and genuine care and concern for each other			1
it was an environment that had been missing from their lives , and it was amazing to watch the changes in attitude and behavior that were occurring			1
a vision quickly formed about building a program			2
it would start with running , and through dedication , hard work and commitment , we would connect our members to job training and educational programs , employment partners and housing opportunities , but only when our members were ready for those steps			1
each person would also have the opportunity to earn approved grant money to move his or her life forward			0
today , @entity104 has operations in five cities ( @entity0 ; @entity96 , @entity97 ; @entity98 ; @entity99 , @entity100 ; and @entity101 , @entity102 ) and works with 29 homeless shelters			1
the organization has more than 400 active members and has helped close to 450 individuals find a better road in life			1
we are expanding to five more cities in 2011 , of which four have been chosen -- @entity111 , @entity112 ; @entity113 , @entity114 ; @entity115 , @entity116 ; and @entity117 , @entity118			0
it 's amazing how we forget that as people , we have similar traits , whether we 're homeless or not			1
@entity123 's hierarchy of needs explains this best			0
when we are hungry , our no. 1 priority becomes looking for food			0
when it 's cold outside , we seek shelter			0
right above those needs is an innate desire to be recognized , valued , appreciated , loved and cared for			1
these desires , just like those of food and shelter , do not become less important as we grow older			0
think about the reasons why you may have quit a job or a relationship			0
chances are feeling unappreciated or undervalued is one of them			0
the only way for real change to happen in someone 's life is for that person to voluntarily participate in making those changes			1
many programs try and force people to do things , but when does forcing anyone to do anything ever have long - lasting sustainable results ? take this simple example			1
let 's say you have a 6 - year old who hates vegetables and wo n't eat them			0
so , you tell him if he does n't eat his vegetables that he wo n't be able to play with his favorite toy			0
as long as you are there to enforce that rule , your 6 - year old may very well eat his vegetables			0
but what happens when he is at a friend 's house and that rule does n't apply ? this method does not solve the problem			0
you have to figure out a way to get your kid to want to eat his vegetables and that is done by giving the vegetables value in a way that your child can relate to			0
what if instead you told your child that it is vegetables , not candy or soda , that will make him big and strong like his dad or older brother ? @entity104 takes this approach to the homeless community			1
we do not offer food or shelter , which in turn means we do n't use threat tactics around those basic human needs			0
the choice to get up at 5:30 a.m. and come out to run is one that is voluntary			2
everyone -- those who are homeless and those who are not -- are there because they want to be			2
they are there because they have found an environment that offers them respect , value , appreciation and friendship			0
when you offer that to someone , it is extraordinary what can happen			0
while @entity104 's first priority is to help people discover their potential and capabilities to get them on a road filled with hope , happiness and prosperity , its mission is to also remind us that while there are many differences between us , there are more similarities			2
by focusing on those similarities , we are reminded that we are all on the same team			0
i am humbled every day by the people invested in @entity104 's mission , and together we have the ability to make real , positive , sustainable change in the world ... one mile at a time			1
