-- @entity1 frequently spews " looney , rancid " anti-semitism , has talked about killing his former girlfriend , and is prone to hate - filled diatribes slamming everyone from @entity6 to @entity7 , according to a screenwriter who has been working with him			1
@entity10 , who wrote a screenplay about the @entity13 hero @entity12 for @entity1 , recounts numerous alleged incidents in detail in a nine - page letter to @entity1 published by the website thewrap.com			1
in a letter replying to @entity19 , @entity1 denies the allegations , saying most of the claims are fabricated			1
@entity1 's letter says @entity10 " only had a problem with me after @entity24 rejected your ( @entity26 ' ) script			1
" @entity1 , in his five - paragraph response , says he wo n't respond " line by line , " and that the decision not to proceed with @entity10 " was based on the quality of your script , not on any other factor			1
" a spokesman for @entity1 , @entity36 , gave @entity0 a copy of the letter and said @entity1 will have no further comment at this time			1
@entity1 's bitter child custody battle with former girlfriend @entity41 ended last year with a court settlement , but not before the actor entered a " no contest " plea to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to a 2010 incident involving @entity41			1
the plea deal put @entity1 on unsupervised probation for three years			2
@entity41 's spokesman told @entity0 thursday that if the @entity26 " is accurate and credible , the allegations are extremely serious and must be investigated immediately by the authorities			1
" " but it will be up to the authorities and ms. @entity41 's attorneys to react to this revelation , " @entity53 said			1
he confirmed she has " been in touch " with her lawyers about the matter			0
@entity24 has put the controversial @entity64 project on hold , the company said			0
" we are analyzing what to do with the project , " said spokesman @entity66			0
like @entity0 , @entity24 is part of @entity71			0
@entity10 writes in his letter , " i 've come to the conclusion that the reason you wo n't make ' the @entity64 ' is the ugliest possible one			2
" he recounts @entity1 repeatedly using derogatory epithets for @entity13 people			2
allegations of @entity81 are nothing new for @entity1			1
concerns that arose among some @entity13 groups over his handling of the story of @entity86 in " @entity87 " in 2004 were replaced by widespread condemnations two years later when @entity1 was arrested on a drunk driving charge			2
according to a police report , he asked the arresting officer if he was @entity13 and said , " @entity92			0
the @entity13 are responsible for all the wars in the world			0
" @entity1 later apologized without acknowledging specific remarks			2
@entity10 is a veteran of the industry , having penned such titles as " @entity98 " and " @entity99			2
" in his letter , he writes that he hoped @entity1 viewed the @entity64 project " as a kind of penance / apologia " -- a claim @entity1 denies in his response			1
@entity10 says that soon after he began working with @entity1 on it , he became " increasingly worried that i 'd made a grave mistake by hooking up with you			1
" it was not immediately clear how thewrap.com obtained @entity10 ' letter			2
in discussing @entity13 people , @entity1 regularly used the terms " @entity114 , " " oven - dodgers , " and " jew - boys , " @entity10 alleges			1
" you said most ' gatekeepers ' of @entity120 companies were ' @entity114 ' who ' controlled their bosses			0
' " " you said the @entity128 was ' mostly a lot of horsesh * t , ' " the letter says , adding that @entity1 made various false accusations , including that the @entity125 refers to sacrificing @entity127 babies			2
@entity1 called pope @entity131 " the anti-christ " and " the devil , " the screenwriter alleges			2
" you kept raging about your ex-girlfriend , @entity41 , " mother of their young daughter @entity139 , the letter alleges , saying @entity1 referred to her with sexist epithets			1
" you acted out for me the scene where you hit her			0
but you said you 'd ' just slapped her a little bit			0
' " @entity10 claims in the letter @entity1 explicitly said , " ' i 'm going to kill her ! i 'm going to have her killed ! ' " addressing @entity1 , he says in the letter , " you said you 'd become friends with two @entity151 agents ( or former @entity151 agents ) and they were going to help you to kill her			1
" @entity10 recounts times that he , his wife , and his 15 - year - old son felt endangered in @entity1 's presence			1
the teen taped one of @entity1 's outbursts on his @entity161 , @entity10 says			1
@entity1 once told the 15 - year - old that he wanted to perform a sex act on @entity41 and " stab her to death while i 'm doing it , " @entity10 alleges			1
" how can you share a loop from the pornographic snuff film which obviously plays in your head ... with a child ? " the letter asks			0
the bitter battle between @entity1 and @entity41 reached a financial and custody settlement last year			1
@entity1 pleaded no contest to a charge of misdemeanor domestic battery			2
racist and sexist rants against her by @entity1 were recorded and leaked to radaronline.com			1
@entity10 also quotes @entity1 as saying @entity6 " deserved to be shot , " and that he hated @entity7 , who appealed " to stupid people			1
" at one point , @entity1 wrote @entity10 a note apologizing for one of his outbursts , saying , " i have a vast reservoir of rage - filled puss that from time to time spills out " and that " the devil seems to afflict me thru anger and my tongue , " @entity10 says			1
in his response letter , @entity1 says " the great majority of the facts as well as the statements and actions attributed to me in your letter are utter fabrications			2
i would have thought that a man of principle , as you purport to be , would have withdrawn from the project regardless of the money if you truly believed me to be the person you describe in your letter			0
" " i will acknowledge like most creative people i am passionate and intense , " @entity1 adds			2
he said he was frustrated at @entity26 ' failure to produce a script in timely fashion			0
" i did react more strongly than i should have			0
i promptly sent you a written apology , the colorful words of which you apparently now find offensive			0
let me now clearly apologize to you and your family in the simplest of terms , " he says in the letter			0
@entity10 insists he was diligent and produced a script that received high praise			1
but @entity1 writes , " in 25 years of script development i have never seen a more substandard first draft or a more significant waste of time			1
" @entity10 could not be reached immediately on thursday			2
when plans were announced last year for @entity1 to helm a movie about the @entity64 , @entity13 leaders assailed the idea			2
" i think it 's , quite frankly , preposterous , " rabbi @entity226 of the @entity227 in @entity228 told @entity0 in september			0
" @entity12 is one of the greatest heroes in @entity13 history			0
... i do n't know what @entity24 was thinking			0
" @entity12 was a @entity233 priest who commanded the resistance to @entity236 forces around 165 b.c. @entity237 celebrates the story of the @entity64			0
" casting him as a director or star of @entity12 is like casting @entity241 to be the head of the @entity243 , " @entity226 said at the time			0
a representative for @entity1 , who asked not to be identified at the time , said , " it 's an amazing story that should be told cinematically " and that there were no plans for @entity1 to act in the film , although he might direct			1
in his letter , @entity10 says he believes @entity1 is in need of medication and " extensive psychiatric counseling			1
" " you live in extreme isolation from the real world , " @entity10 wrote			0
" you do n't read newspapers or magazines , you never have the tv on except to watch movies -- often your own			0
even the church where you worship , built at your own personal expense , is attended only by family and friends			0
the priest there is your hire and works for you , not @entity269			0
you are truly extraordinarily and uniquely self - absorbed in a town where self - absorption is common			0
noting that " there are as many guns around your house as crucifixes , " @entity10 wrote , " i worry for you and those around you			0
" @entity0 's @entity277 in @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
