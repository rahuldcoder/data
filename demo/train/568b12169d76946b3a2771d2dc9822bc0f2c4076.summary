-- want to make @entity1 roll over in his grave ? this @entity3 , take your hand out of the turkey 's body cavity and turn off the football game to make some new traditions with friends and family			1
a vegetarian yoga retreat or an ethnic food tour of the @entity14 may seem like an unusual way to spend the @entity3 holiday , but making new traditions with those you love can be the perfect way to celebrate the holiday season			1
here are six ways you can have the best unconventional @entity3 ever , whether you 're ready to hop on a jet now or start making alternative plans for next year			1
tradition : arguing with family spin : comedy show if your extended family shares the same religious , political and sports beliefs , you can disregard this tip. ( you might need to check that you have n't accidentally walked onto the set of " @entity33 , " because we do n't actually believe you			2
) getting a bunch of related , multigenerational people together in close quarters for an extended period of time is more likely to end up looking like something from a slasher film than from a " @entity43 " episode			2
the tension quotient rises even more if out - of - towners are staying with you for the holiday weekend			0
relieve the tension and get some much - needed laughter by seeing a comedy show @entity3 weekend			1
" @entity52 " great @entity49 is performing at @entity51 's @entity50 the day after @entity3			1
or visit " @entity57 " star @entity53 at the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , for another chance to liven up the mood after @entity3 festivities are over			1
plenty of other comedy clubs are open across the country			0
really , what time of year do we need more stress relief than around the holidays ? if they 're closed , pelt the door with leftover turkey giblets			2
tradition : @entity73 coma spin : @entity76 yoga retreat for many people , simply hearing the word " @entity3 " evokes memories of too - tight waistbands and a four - hour food coma			1
while a feast can be a wonderful thing at any time of the year , shake things up during the holiday season by tightening your belt instead of loosening it			2
explore stunning @entity76 and bring harmony to your life with a calming yoga retreat			1
@entity92 's @entity91 focuses on healing from any and all addictions ( turkey can certainly count as an addiction ) through morning and afternoon @entity98 classes and explorations of the surrounding natural landscape			0
when not meditating or perfecting yoga poses , you can try surfing , swimming , ziplining and whitewater rafting			2
give your body a chance to detox from holiday goodies with the program 's gourmet vegetarian cuisine and its @entity110 , which offers meals consisting of crisp greens , grains and legumes without oils or seasonings			0
tradition : lying on the couch spin : pushups for charity food is supposed to give your body energy			0
if you 're eating enough turkey ( and stuffing and mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce and rolls and pumpkin pie ) to send you into a motionless stupor after lunch , that 's probably not healthy			0
even if you ca n't imagine @entity3 without these delectable dishes , you can counterbalance some of the negative effects with some pre- and post-feast exercise			1
@entity138 marathons take place all over the country on thursday , november 27			0
for an even less - conventional way to get your blood pumping during @entity3 week , try participating in @entity143 , in which the @entity145 town of @entity146 holds an annual @entity148 to not only fend off the effects of rich holiday foods but to benefit those in need			1
bring some canned goods and participate in a free trainer - led workout session to start the season off right			0
tradition : @entity158 shopping spin : @entity161 service trip if you usually spend your @entity3 evening ripping items away from other people in the @entity158 department stores , stop for a minute			1
do you even remember what you bought last year ? consider giving to others during a peaceful trip to @entity161 to help preserve its natural elephant habitats			1
when you 're not planting and harvesting sugarcane and grass or constructing shade shelters for @entity176 's endangered animals , take @entity178 cooking classes and peruse the local outdoor markets			2
volunteers become familiar with the elephants by feeding , walking and even bathing them			2
if the choice is between bathing an elephant and wrenching a 40 % - off scarf out of someone 's hand , is it really a choice ? tradition : hours of football spin : soccer match in @entity194 although @entity195 traditionally sink back into their couches on @entity3 to cheer for whichever team has the most players on their fantasy teams , try enjoying a different kind of football with a trip to a @entity204 match in @entity194			1
sure , you 'll miss such classic @entity207 matchups as the @entity209 - @entity208 , 49ers - @entity210 and @entity211 - @entity212			0
in @entity194 , you can actually participate in the uproar of a professional sports game rather than passively watch it in a food coma on your couch			0
the @entity219 football -- soccer to @entity195 -- club is playing @entity222 on @entity3			2
for 90 minutes of pure action with no pesky stoppages after every down and no padding when the players crash into each other , visit @entity194 for a rousing good time in a country that does n't take its alcohol lightly			0
tradition : eating traditional dishes spin : post-thanksgiving multiethnic tour it 's almost overwhelming how much time and energy we spend picking out , dressing , cooking and then carefully carving the fattest turkey we can find for @entity3			1
not to mention the string of turkey casseroles and sandwiches and soups that follow for weeks afterward			0
@entity73 can be delicious , but how much do you really want to eat ? for an exciting twist , join the @entity248 multiethnic eating tour on @entity51 's @entity14			0
explore the @entity249 @entity14 , @entity250 and @entity251 with other foodies for some spices and flavors that you ca n't stuff inside a turkey cavity			0
while you stroll the city sampling mouthwatering street foods , be thankful that you are n't eating yet another can of wobbly cranberry sauce .			0
