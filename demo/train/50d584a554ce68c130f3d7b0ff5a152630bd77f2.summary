-- the first statuette of the 70th annual @entity2 went to @entity3 , whose character in " @entity5 " shot two men and a horse in two scenes before i even opened my box of @entity11 's			1
but that did n't surprise me , because " @entity13 , " a bloody homage to spaghetti westerns , is a creation of one of my guilty pleasures , director @entity17			1
one of the most important auteurs in cinema today , @entity17 's scripts are intoxicating -- with witty dialogue ; surprising and satisfying story arcs , and cartoonish body counts			1
" @entity13 " won him a @entity2 for screenwriting			2
and thus the nation 's conundrum			0
a month into our @entity29 world , " @entity5 " -- a movie that makes mass murder look cool -- has scooped up more than $ 125 million in three weeks			1
is it me , or does it seem odd that a director known for ultra gun violence in his films has the biggest - grossing movie of his career in the wake of the massacre in @entity39 , @entity40 , that killed 20 kids ? not to get all @entity42 , but would n't you think the nation would n't have the stomach to see such a glorification of gun violence so close to the tragedy ? and yet , here we are : @entity50 is slated to " @entity61 " again ; " @entity55 " has been reimagined into a tale about siblings carrying automatic assault weapons and looking for witches to kill ; and 65 - year - old @entity56 is taking on the @entity58 cartel , including shooting a @entity59 from a school bus			1
and that 's just over the course of a month			0
before meeting with vice president @entity67 to discuss violence in films and video games , @entity65 chairman and former sen. @entity66 told @entity71 that the movie industry is vehemently opposed to content regulation , adding " we have a free and open society that celebrates the @entity75			2
" in an @entity77 interview , @entity17 said it was disrespectful to the victims to bring up violence in movies in relationship to @entity39			1
" obviously , the issue is gun control and mental health , " he said			0
but as we wait for @entity67 's gun control proposals to be revealed , as well as the ensuing debate in @entity91 to unfold , it 's important to remember this conversation is threefold			2
mass shootings -- like those at @entity39 , @entity95 , the @entity97 temple in @entity98 , and the @entity99 , @entity100 , movie theater -- and everyday street violence , like what 's going on in @entity104 , can be addressed immediately by legislation			1
but background checks and assault rifle bans will not free us from our most debilitating shackle , and that is our numbness , if not addiction , to violence , particularly in film			2
of the 100 top - grossing movies of 2012 , only three were rated @entity115 in the top 10 were @entity117 , including " @entity118 , " a film about kids brutally killing each other for sport ; two were @entity117 and one was @entity124 this is why , when celebrities came together to film an anti-gun public service announcement , they were immediately called out as hypocrites , and rightfully so			2
in one scene in the @entity17 movie @entity132 , who plays the main character , @entity13 , shoots a man carrying sticks of dynamite , and the guy is literally blown into pieces			0
and @entity132 is the first person you see in an anti-gun ad ? please			0
it 's hard enough to find the right balance between the freedoms guaranteed to us by the @entity145 and living in a gun - happy @entity146 , without cries for control coming from an industry that continues to glorify the lack of control			0
for those of us who feel comfortable calling out the @entity155 crowd for hiding behind the @entity156 , consider the actions of the @entity159 crowd , which hides behind the @entity75 in its manipulative glorification of gun violence			1
or consider the actions of @entity164 , who year in and year out spend billions to watch someone wielding an @entity168 shotgun , which spits out 300 rounds a minute , mow down people on the big screen			0
i do n't believe the government should pressure @entity159 to make less violent movies			0
the industry is only giving us what we want to see			0
even now , just four short weeks after 20 children and six adults were massacred in @entity39 , we still crave gun violence and death by chainsaw			1
the @entity182 and @entity183 can address mass shootings and violent crimes , but the culture of violence is n't about @entity67 , @entity132 or @entity17			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity191 : @entity17 's bloody " @entity5 " got two @entity2
film that makes mass murder look cool is *hugely* *popular* even after @entity39 , he says
he says celebrities who *protest* gun violence yet star in *ultraviolent* films are hypocritical
@entity191 : films should n't be censored ; the real *culprit* is our addiction to violence
