they hugged at the @entity2 border crossing			0
and in @entity5 , @entity6 , they gave a hero 's welcome for the young soldier who last saw his hometown five years ago			1
the release of @entity6 soldier @entity12 in exchange for the eventual release of 1,027 palestinians held by @entity6 unleashed a powerful wave of celebration among @entity15 and @entity6 alike			1
it also raised the ire of some @entity6 , who worry the deal would lead to more violence			1
in @entity5 , onlookers waved @entity6 flags , danced , cheered and tossed white roses at a convoy carrying the young soldier home			1
he emerged from a white van and briefly acknowledged the crowd with a wave before uniformed officers hustled him away , apparently into his parents ' home			2
at the @entity2 crossing from @entity35 to @entity3 , masked @entity37 gunmen accompanied buses filled with released prisoners to a terminal where they met with friends and relatives for emotional reunions before a mass celebration and parade in @entity3			1
some of them chanted , " we want another @entity12 , " @entity47 's @entity46 reported			2
crowds of @entity15 flooded the streets of @entity3 , waving flags and banners to welcome the released prisoners home			1
they pressed up to buses carrying the prisoners to a rally in @entity3 , reaching out to touch the newly freed as they leaned out windows			1
people shouted , " with our blood and with our hearts we sacrifice for you prisoners			0
" @entity65 was awaiting the release of his son @entity67 , who was arrested when he was 17 and had been in prison 24 years			0
" i am very very happy for the release of my son @entity67 , " he said			0
" the celebrations and happiness wo n't be complete until all @entity15 prisoners are free from @entity6 prisons			1
" @entity74 told @entity47 he was waiting for the release of his mother @entity76 , who has served one year of a 2Â½ - year sentence for trying to stab an @entity6 soldier			1
" i am very happy and ca n't wait to hug my mother again , " he said , weeping			0
@entity37 official @entity80 welcomed the release of some prisoners but said it was not enough			0
" we are all shedding two tears : one tear for the release of all of our fighters , and a tear of pain for all of our brothers still in prison , " he said			0
@entity6 prime minister @entity93 used strikingly similar language to describe his nation 's emotions at the release of @entity12			1
" today we are all united in joy and in pain			0
... this is also a hard day ; even if the price had been smaller , it would still have been heavy , " he said			0
while @entity6 are solidly supportive of the deal , they are nearly split on the question of whether the release will harm @entity6 security , according to a poll of 500 people conducted by the @entity112 for the @entity114 newspaper			2
@entity115 , an @entity6 peace activist who helped negotiate the deal , said it will help encourage democratic trends in @entity15 areas			1
" it 's certainly an emotional day in my life , " he said			0
but @entity122 , whose daughter died in the 2001 bombing of a @entity126 pizzeria , called the exchange " quite catastrophic			0
" one of the prisoners released tuesday was a woman who @entity122 said masterminded the bombing			0
" what happened here is that under conditions of extortion , the government of @entity6 has done everything it needs to do to bring home a soldier , " he said			1
" but it 's emptied its prisons of security prisoners , terrorists , murderers , people who stood trial and who have the most unimaginable crimes on their records			2
so this is a horrible outcome			0
" of course , @entity15 officials do n't see it that way , and hope tuesday 's scene will be repeated again and again until all of the estimated 5,000 palestinians held by @entity6 are released			1
@entity15 prime mister @entity156 told cheering crowds they had " fought and sacrificed , and you will see the results of your struggle in an independent @entity15 state with @entity126 as its capital			2
" and he said more prisoners would be released			0
" we have made an agreement with the @entity6 government to release another group of prisoners , and we call on them to keep their promises , " he said .			2

in @entity6 soldier 's hometown , *residents* wave flags , dance , cheer his **return**
in @entity3 , *thousands* cheer the **return** of @entity15 prisoners
some say the exchange will help the peace process
others worry it will lead to more violence
