shouts of " hands up , do n't shoot ! " and " no justice , no peace			1
stop the racist police , " fill the chilly november air as the crowd jostles for position in a fenced - off pen on the sidewalk			0
hundreds have gathered to voice their anger and frustration at events in @entity15 , @entity16 , and to offer their support for the family of @entity19 , the unarmed black teenager shot dead by a white police officer in august			1
many of those taking part in the protest also demonstrated here during the summer ; months later , following the decision of a @entity27 not to indict @entity28 for killing @entity19 , they have returned			1
some wave placards reading " justice for @entity19 , " " @entity39 " and " @entity40 , " while others cup candles in their hands , protecting them from the autumn drizzle as their chants of " killer police off our streets " echo around the square			1
but this is n't @entity45 or @entity46 or @entity47			0
it is @entity49 , @entity50 -- more than 4,000 miles from @entity15 and a sign of how fury at the controversial case has resonated across the @entity54			1
the protesters have gathered outside the @entity56 in @entity57 , an imposing fortress - like structure amid the 18th - century terraces of one of @entity49 's most exclusive addresses			1
@entity63 is among those to address the crowd , which organizers say numbered up to 1,500 people			0
her nephew @entity69 , 29 , was shot by police in north @entity49 in 2011			1
his death sparked protests that led to days of rioting across @entity49 and other @entity50 cities			2
his family say he was unarmed , a victim both of the police and of a smear campaign by the media which portrayed him as a " gangster			2
" an inquest into his death found that he was lawfully killed , and that it was more likely than not that he had thrown a gun away shortly before police fired at him			0
@entity63 's aunt said the people of @entity15 had been " pushed to the edge " and felt they had no other choice but to take to the streets			1
she insisted they were " very , very brave " to do so despite the threat posed by " trigger happy " @entity56 police			1
offering her condolences to the @entity19 family , she told the crowd : " we feel the pain , we know the pain of losing somebody at the hands of the police			1
we stand in solidarity with the people of @entity15			2
" it was this feeling of solidarity which had brought most people -- black , white , young and old -- onto the streets of @entity107			0
@entity63 warned the crowd : " what happens there will eventually happen here : if they can murder @entity19 the way they did , they can murder anyone 's mother , father , brother , sister , daughter or son			2
" @entity123 sees painful parallels between the case of @entity19 and that of her brother @entity127			2
the 40 - year old died in police custody in @entity49 in 2008			1
an inquest ruled police officers used an unsuitable degree of force to restrain him			0
she says " institutional racism " is a global problem			0
" we need change " she insists			0
" there needs to be a political will to change , a political will for justice			0
" @entity123 refuses to condone the looting and arson attacks in @entity15 and elsewhere but says she understands the frustration people feel when loved ones are killed			2
" what else are they supposed to do ? people are dying unnecessarily on the streets			0
how can there be peace if there is no justice ? " several hours after the rally began , dozens of protesters marched from the embassy along new @entity160 -- home to some of @entity49 's most upscale designer stores -- and into @entity164 , one of the capital 's biggest shopping centers , their windows filled with @entity170 displays and twinkling fairy lights			1
others marched along @entity173 , past @entity174 -- home of the prime minister -- to @entity177 and @entity178 , headquarters of the @entity180 , which covers @entity49			2
protester @entity181 says she is an " ordinary mother " just like @entity185 , the mother of @entity19 , and that like her she has brought her son up to respect the police			1
but she is still anxious whenever her son goes out that something will happen to him			0
" i saw [ @entity19 's ] mother crying this morning -- i 'm a mother just like her ; i 've raised my son , i love my son , as much as she loves -- or loved -- hers , " @entity188 told @entity189			0
" the very thought of someone taking my son 's life , i do n't know what would happen to me , i do n't know if i 'd survive ... i would die of a broken heart			0
" @entity200 , from @entity201 , says it is important for communities outside the @entity56 to come together in support of the people of @entity15			1
" we can pressure the @entity56 government ... [ show them ] that there are people in solidarity , from different movements in different countries who speak different languages , and who are going to be promoting these calls for accountability against @entity28			0
" @entity218 took part in the protest " in solidarity with another murder of @entity224 people , whether it is here or in the @entity56 " adding that while @entity19 's death had hit the headlines , he was just one black @entity229 to die in such a situation : " we know that there are many , many more going on ... the situation of enslavement is continuing			1
" @entity218 says hopes had once been high that the election of @entity236 -- the first black @entity56 president -- could mend the @entity56 's troubled civil rights history , but that in practice it had done little to improve the situation			0
" he was given the @entity242 almost before he went into office , but where 's the peace ? " complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity15			0
