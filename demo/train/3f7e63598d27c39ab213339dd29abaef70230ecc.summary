-- voters in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 on tuesday kick off five straight weeks of primary contests that could give us a clearer indication of whether establishment @entity8 have the upper hand against the tea party movement for control of the party			1
the results could back up recent tough talk from @entity18 @entity17 leader @entity16 , who predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right , saying , " i think we are going to crush them everywhere			1
" and they may have a major impact in determining whether @entity17 retake the majority in the @entity18			2
since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009 , primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the @entity17 and hurt the party 's chances of winning back the @entity18 from @entity34 in the past two election cycles			1
candidates backed by the tea party movement and other grass - roots conservatives effectively cost the @entity17 five winnable @entity18 elections the last two cycles in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity3 and @entity44			1
complete coverage : 2014 midterm elections two months ago , @entity47 , whom the right sees as part of the problem in @entity51 , told the @entity52 that when it came to tea party challenges , " i do n't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country			1
" his prediction might come true			0
establishment leaders say they have learned their lessons from the past two elections and are better at counterattacking this time around			0
so why do incumbents and establishment - backed candidates appear to have the upper hand this time around ? " i do n't think we can say that the tea party movement is dead , but there seems to be less enthusiasm among their activists and supporters this year , " said @entity65 , senior editor for the nonpartisan @entity66 , a top campaign handicapper			1
" @entity8 and incumbents have learned to run against tea party - backed candidates			1
" and outside help this time may be making a difference			0
" i think the @entity17 establishment is fighting back more than in previous cycles			1
there is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries			0
i think in the past , it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups , " said @entity87 , deputy editor of the nonpartisan @entity88			0
2014 midterms : key races to watch @entity96 ' changed the narrative ' but leaders of the 5 - year - old grass - roots movement disagree with the suggestion that the tide has turned against them			2
" i think the establishment is taking its victory lap a little early , " said @entity102 , spokesman for the @entity103 , who added that " there are more wins to come			0
" and regardless of the outcome of the primary contests , @entity108 says the tea party is already victorious " regardless of the outcome in the primary races , the tea party has already won because we have changed the narrative and the political landscape in @entity51			1
now , both sides of the aisle express concern about our ballooning national debt , " said @entity108 , who just stepped down as chairwoman of the @entity119 and is now helping @entity120 in his bid to unseat @entity47 in @entity122			0
primary calendar : who votes when vulnerable @entity34 put control of the @entity18 in play in @entity2 , first - term @entity34 sen. @entity131 is vulnerable			1
flipping her seat and five others held by @entity34 would give @entity17 control of the @entity18			1
@entity17 establishment nervously watches @entity2 the @entity34 hold a 55 - 45 majority in the @entity18 but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in november , with half of those @entity34 seats in red or purple states , such as @entity2 , which will be the first indicator whether things will be different this time			1
the establishment is rallying around state house speaker @entity143 , the front - runner in a multi-candidate field for the @entity17 @entity18 nomination			1
@entity143 was endorsed monday by 2012 @entity17 presidential nominee @entity147 and late last week by former @entity149 gov. @entity148 , who 's seriously considering a bid for president in 2016			0
the most recent polling indicates @entity143 hovering right around the 40 % mark , which he needs to crack in order to avoid a july runoff			0
the two most serious challengers are @entity158 , a tea party activist and first - time candidate who enjoys the support of some major tea party groups , as well as other influential conservative organizations and endorsements from the likes of sens. @entity167 of @entity168 and @entity169 of @entity122 , who joined @entity158 on monday at an rally in @entity171 on the eve of the primary			1
the other major candidate is @entity175 , a prominent baptist minister who helped drive the 2012 passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the state 's same - sex marriage ban			0
@entity175 enjoys the support of a high - profile fellow pastor : former @entity183 gov. @entity181 , a 2008 @entity17 presidential candidate who may run again for the @entity184 in 2016			2
while none of the candidates , including @entity143 , have raised or spent a lot of money in the campaign , the state house speaker enjoys the support of the @entity194 @entity193 and @entity195 , two outside groups that combined have spent millions this cycle to run ads backing @entity143 and other establishment picks			0
last week , in what was described as a major buy , the pro-business @entity193 launched a television commercial that described @entity143 as " a bold conservative who balanced our budget and reduced regulations			0
a businessman who delivered tax relief			0
" and @entity195 , the big - spending outside group co-founded and steered by @entity210 , says it 's spent nearly $ 2 million in support of @entity143			0
that spending dwarfs the money shelled out by outside conservative groups backing @entity158			0
and in a sign that @entity143 is seen as the most feared of the @entity17 candidates , the @entity215 put out a spot critical of two of his aides			0
overall , 90 % of all the ad spending in the @entity18 race in @entity2 has so far come from outside groups rather than the actual campaigns			2
' @entity227 ' star seeks congressional seat while the @entity18 battle is the marquee race in @entity2 on tuesday , some @entity184 primaries are also grabbing attention			2
two - term @entity17 rep. @entity233 is facing a primary challenge from a conservative talk radio host because of her being open to consider some limited immigration reform			2
and in @entity2 's 2nd @entity238 , former " @entity227 " star @entity237 is in a heated primary for the @entity34 nomination			1
@entity237 's star power put to test in @entity2 primary in the state 's 3rd @entity238 , 10 - term @entity244 rep. @entity244 , an anti-war libertarian , is once again fighting for his political life , this time against establishment pick @entity247 , a former @entity248 administration official who also had a senior role in @entity148 's 2004 re-election campaign			1
can mr. @entity244 stay in @entity51 ? more showdowns over coming weeks next tuesday , the tea party could score what could end up its only win in @entity18 primary showdowns this year			1
conservative @entity256 of @entity257 , president of @entity259 , has been showered with support and endorsements recently from former @entity263 gov. @entity262 , the 2008 @entity17 vice presidential nominee , and sens. @entity265 of @entity266 and @entity167 of @entity168 , as well as the backing of @entity268 , the @entity269 and @entity270			0
some polling suggests that @entity256 is now all tied up with @entity272 , the former state treasurer who 's considered the establishment favorite			0
but on the same day , seven - term rep. @entity274 is expected to easily win the @entity17 @entity18 nomination in @entity276 , where the party hopes to snatch the seat long held by retiring @entity34 sen. @entity279			1
@entity274 's considered a moderate , and while some conservative groups criticized her early in her bid , she 's faced no serious opposition from the right for the nomination			0
a week later , on may 20 , the action moves to @entity122 , where @entity47 faces a challenge , and @entity287 , where there 's a wide - open , free - for - all fight to succeed retiring @entity17 sen. @entity289			2
@entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 , former @entity287 secretary of state @entity294 , and businessman @entity295 are the major candidates in the race			0
@entity298 and @entity295 , rather than the more conservative @entity292 and @entity291 , are considered the frontrunners in the contentious @entity17 primary			2
the winner will face off against @entity302 , the all - but - certain @entity34 nominee and daughter of the longtime @entity287 @entity194 senator			2
@entity47 faces challenge of his own @entity47 faces a challenge from tea party - backed @entity120			1
while this race has seen big spending -- both by the campaigns and from outside groups -- the five - term @entity47 is expected to cruise to renomination			0
but he faces a serious challenge in november from rising @entity34 star @entity317 , whom big - name @entity34 are already campaigning for			2
on the same day in @entity320 , @entity319 pediatric neurosurgeon dr. @entity318 is considered the frontrunner over more conservative state rep. @entity322 in the race for the @entity17 @entity18 nomination			2
the winner of that contest will face off in november against first - term @entity34 sen. @entity328 , who @entity17 think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave year for the @entity17			1
and in @entity331 , there 's a high - profile incumbent - vs. - tea party challenge primary in the @entity184 , where eight - term rep. @entity333 faces a serious primary challenge from conservative favorite @entity335			1
a week later , on june 3 , the establishment - vs. - tea party contest shifts to @entity338 , which is among eight states holding primaries that day			1
six - term sen. @entity341 is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker @entity343 in @entity338			0
private polling shows @entity341 with a comfortable lead , but outside establishment groups are taking nothing for granted .			0

establishment @entity17 are fighting back more *strongly* against challenges from the right
with a number of vulnerable @entity34 in the @entity18 , @entity17 thinks it can win control
@entity2 primary seen as a key test of establishment - vs. - tea party *scenario*
