-- in the past two weeks , the @entity1 has had a number of agents either resign or get fired in disgrace for their actions in @entity6			1
the uniformed service members supporting the agents are being investigated under the @entity8 , and the media frenzy remains insatiable			0
are we surprised ? is n't this story about grown men acting badly ? of course not , it 's far more troubling			0
this is about at least one disciplined and professional organization failing to lead or act consistent with the discipline required of their service , whether it is the secret service or the military			1
senators criticize military briefing on @entity6 scandal we expect them to set the standard for discipline and leadership and they failed at both			1
the good news is we found out about these shenanigans before this incredibly bad behavior became an acceptable new , lower standard			2
the problem , you see , is leadership has no variable speed , no levels of acceptance			2
there is but one standard			2
you either lead or you do n't			0
leadership is about getting people to do things they otherwise would not do when no one else is looking			2
well , no surprise here that in our cyber world , when everything everyone does is subject to scrutiny , some one is always looking			0
agent posted @entity57 picture on @entity59 page it 's @entity61 ve to assume otherwise			0
the @entity1 and their military support team were idiots to assume that they could act badly and get away with it			1
as citizens and taxpayers , we 'd expect good discipline from these folks without having to have some one check up on them			1
but sadly , they failed us and demonstrated that they need supervision			0
do n't think that this band of agents and their military support was anything other than a gaggle of guys , acting more like punks that leaders			0
my suggestion is that there was not one leader in the bunch			0
if there was a leader , he failed to show up for the most important mission he accepted ... protecting our president			1
something did not go wrong ; something is wrong			0
my suggestion is that the @entity1 is a great agency that failed at its core mission ... to lead and act like no one is looking			1
however , for some inexplicable reason that challenges the agency 's core , it defined leadership in an entirely unrecognizable way			1
these are not young " troops " acting out badly			0
did events in @entity6 change everything or was something wrong long before events in @entity6 ? join us at @entity59 / @entity112 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity115 .			1

the scandal involving *prostitution* in @entity6 has *embarrassed* the @entity1
@entity115 : we expect them to set the standard for discipline and leadership
" @entity1 is a great agency that failed at its core mission , " says @entity115
