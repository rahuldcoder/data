-- leaders of the burgeoning @entity3 movement say their projected midterm election victories should send a strong message : watch out in 2012			1
" the @entity6 need to know , we 've done it in 2010			2
if they do n't do the right thing in the next couple of years , it 's not a problem			0
we 'll come back in 2012			1
we 'll do it all over again			0
we 'll replace them with people that will uphold [ our ] principles , " said @entity13 , co-founder of @entity14 -- one of the movement 's largest groups			2
tuesday 's elections were seen as a crucial moment for measuring the staying power of the @entity3 movement , which was born out of frustration with the political establishment and steeped in economic anxiety			1
" i do n't think there 's any question that if it were not for the @entity3 , the @entity6 margin in the @entity32 would not be as high as it 's going to be , " @entity0 senior political analyst @entity28 said tuesday night			1
" they gave a lot of enthusiasm and fuel to the @entity6			2
" after @entity0 projected that two @entity3 - backed @entity6 candidates would win their @entity39 races -- @entity40 in @entity41 and @entity42 in @entity43 -- @entity13 said the movement would keep holding @entity6 accountable			1
" frankly , the @entity6 blew it over a very long period of time			2
the largest deficit ever run up in history , before the current administration , was run up by @entity51 , " he said			0
" our job is to reverse that course and not allow any party to ever do that again			0
" with growing momentum after months of nationwide street protests and bus tours , @entity3 activists hoped to change the makeup of @entity62 and the way lawmakers were elected			1
at least one of their goals seemed to be likely early wednesday , with @entity0 projections indicating that @entity6 held 239 @entity32 seats to the @entity69 ' 183 -- well over the 218 seats needed for a majority			1
and in a tight battle and a significant win for @entity3 supporters , @entity72 candidate @entity72 defeated @entity69 rep. @entity76 to win the @entity39 seat , @entity0 projects			1
but even though candidates endorsed by @entity3 activists made several key gains , the movement also suffered significant losses in high - profile contests			1
far - right ideology from @entity3 candidates likely cost them @entity39 seats in @entity87 and @entity88 , according to @entity89 , a @entity0 contributor and senior political columnist for @entity92			1
" that could make all the difference in control of the @entity39 , so there should be some self - analysis about whether or not some of these more extreme candidates who won these partisan primaries represented their @entity6 best , " he said			1
the grassroots nature of the @entity3 movement makes it difficult to define how many candidates on the ballot tuesday were affiliated with it			2
there is no official entity that determines who is a @entity3 candidate			2
before polls opened tuesday , @entity0 analyzed races across the country to identify candidates who were @entity3 activists or whose campaigns were helped significantly by the @entity3 movement			1
from the list of the @entity0 100 -- the top 100 @entity32 races in the country -- 21 candidates were closely connected with the movement 's activists and ideology			1
at least 10 of them won , according to @entity0 projections			0
nine @entity39 candidates and four gubernatorial candidates also had strong ties to the @entity3			1
of those candidates , at least five @entity39 race winners were backed by @entity3 activists			1
and the winner of @entity132 's governor race , @entity130 , received @entity3 support and an endorsement from former @entity136 gov. @entity135			0
in addition , various national and local @entity3 organizations endorsed more than 100 candidates in races across the country			0
the rise of the conservative @entity3 movement added a new element to this year 's election cycle , roiling @entity6 races by boosting little - known and inexperienced candidates to victory over mainstream figures in @entity6 primaries across the country			1
but not all of them emerged victorious tuesday			0
according to @entity0 projections , @entity3 - backed @entity153 gubernatorial candidate @entity152 lost to @entity155 and former state attorney general @entity156			2
senate majority leader @entity157 of @entity88 avoided what many predicted would be a fatal blow to @entity69 , beating out @entity3 activist @entity160			2
and in @entity87 , democrat @entity161 defeated @entity3 - backed @entity6 nominee @entity162 , @entity0 projects			1
still , the losing @entity3 candidates appeared to be in high spirits as they addressed supporters after results came in			2
" we were victorious , because the @entity87 political system will never be the same			0
that 's a great thing			0
the @entity6 will never be the same , " @entity162 said			0
@entity170 thanked supporters for fighting for their principles			0
" i want you to see that i 'm still smiling			0
and it 's because i still believe in @entity177 exceptionalism , " she said			0
no matter how many of the so - called @entity3 candidates won , the impact of the movement is expected to shift the @entity6 agenda to the right			1
@entity40 , on the heels of his victory , has already called for creating a @entity39 @entity3 caucus			1
of those surveyed in @entity0 exit polls , 23 percent said one reason for their vote tuesday was to send a message in favor of the @entity3 , 18 percent said they cast their ballots against the @entity195 and 56 percent of respondents said the @entity3 was not a factor in their decision			0
independents surveyed were split , with 24 percent saying they were neutral toward the @entity3 , and 28 percent saying they opposed the @entity195 in this election			0
exit poll results indicated a stronger showing for the @entity3 among older voters , with 47 percent of those 60 and older saying they support the @entity195 and only 26 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 saying they support the movement			1
but @entity132 sen. @entity206 said the success of the @entity3 is rooted in the fact that its members ca n't be easily counted			0
" one mistake we 're making in this election is to suggest that it 's all about the official @entity3 movement , " he told @entity0 tuesday			2
" for everyone who goes out to a rally , there are often hundreds , even thousands of people who feel the same way , who do n't consider themselves a part of the @entity3 movement			2
i think there is an awakening going on in our country			0
there 's a beginning of a process			0
it 's not finalized tonight			0
" @entity0 's @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .			0

" we 'll come back in 2012 . we 'll do it all over again , " a movement leader says
