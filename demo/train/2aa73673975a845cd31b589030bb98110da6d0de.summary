, on which she has interviewed @entity10 , @entity11 and more			0
here , the fashionista ( who profiles designer @entity13 in @entity14 , available at time.com / style ) lets loose with us			2
time : of all the fashion heavyweights you 've talked to , who surprised you the most ? @entity20 : @entity21			1
i was just interviewing him in @entity23 , and i asked him , " after all these years , how you still can look at a dress and see that it needs to be a millimeter longer ? " and he said , " well i 'm not blind yet ! " he 's very quick , he 's very funny , and i think you have to be very smart to be funny			2
time : but he 's not exactly a @entity3 staple			2
how do you tailor your fashion coverage to viewers who are more accustomed to hard news ? @entity20 : in order to tell great stories , you need great characters			1
it does n't matter whether you 're covering the political race or the aftermath of a hurricane or fashion			2
so my approach has always been to be more character - driven than collection - driven			0
and there 's no shortage of characters in fashion ! time : like @entity21 ? @entity20 : @entity45 , like @entity21			1
the other thing i try to do , and i think this is really important , is make my fashion coverage accessible			1
people always say , " oh , you 're the new @entity51 ! " but i think the show that she did [ @entity3 's @entity53 , which ran from 1980 to 2000 ] and the show that i do are very different , because we live in a different world			2
my fashion coverage has to be both aspirational and accessible			2
time : you 've reported extensively on politics			0
why do you think people are so interested in what candidates and their spouses are wearing ? @entity20 : it just gives us another thing to talk about			1
and i think in many ways , @entity67 changed the game			1
she came onto the scene wearing @entity71 one day and @entity72 the next			0
there 's something appealing about that , no matter your politics			2
i know it 's exciting for me to watch			0
time : what do you make of @entity83 's outfits ? @entity20 : i think she plays it a little bit more conservative			1
maybe that has something to do with her politics			0
i 'll leave it at that			0
time : how do you dress well for tv ? @entity20 : you know what they say -- the camera adds 10 pounds			1
so fit is incredibly important			1
i tend to favor dresses			0
i tend to favor three - quarter sleeve cardigans and a little belt , but i like to say i do n't own many pants			1
i like the ease of a dress			0
you zip it up and you go			0
so as long as it fits great , i 'm in			0
time : you travel to so many fashion shows for work			0
what 's your go - to comfort heel ? @entity20 : my go - to comfort heel is a flat			1
time : @entity116 © ! @entity20 : no , but really , i change between shows			1
every female @entity118 can relate to that			0
nobody wants to walk around in a high - heeled shoe ! i 'll carry my beautiful high heels in a bag			0
i 've seen people do that on the subway			0
@entity20 : it 's something my mother told me a long time ago			1
i 'm just now starting to listen ! @entity1 is a national correspondent for @entity3 and host of @entity130 : @entity9			1
fashion : backstage pass with @entity1 debuts on sept. 15 at 2:30pm e.t. on @entity133			1

@entity20 calls @entity67 's style " fashionable " and @entity83 's " conservative " .
fit is important for @entity20 on camera -- she favors dresses , *3/4* sleeve cardigans and belts .
