-- every day where we work , we see our young students struggling with the transition from home to school			2
they 're all wonderful kids , but some ca n't share easily or listen in a group			2
some have impulse control problems and have trouble keeping their hands to themselves ; others do n't always see that actions have consequences ; a few suffer terribly from separation anxiety			2
we 're not talking about preschool children			0
these are @entity19 undergraduate students whom we teach and advise			1
they all know how to work , but some of them have n't learned how to play			0
parents , educators , psychologists , neuroscientists , and politicians generally fall into one of two camps when it comes to preparing very young children for school : play - based or skills - based			1
these two kinds of curricula are often pitted against one another as a zero - sum game : if you want to protect your daughter 's childhood , so the argument goes , choose a play - based program ; but if you want her to get into @entity19 , you 'd better make sure you 're brushing up on the @entity43 flashcards every night before bed			1
we think it is quite the reverse			0
or , in any case , if you want your child to succeed in college , the play - based curriculum is the way to go			1
in fact , we wonder why play is not encouraged in educational periods later in the developmental life of young people -- giving kids more practice as they get closer to the ages of our students			1
why do this ? one of the best predictors of school success is the ability to control impulses			0
children who can control their impulse to be the center of the universe , and -- relatedly -- who can assume the perspective of another person , are better equipped to learn			1
psychologists calls this the " theory of mind " : the ability to recognize that our own ideas , beliefs , and desires are distinct from those of the people around us			0
when a four - year - old destroys someone 's carefully constructed block castle or a 20 - year - old belligerently monopolizes the class discussion on a routine basis , we might conclude that they are unaware of the feelings of the people around them			0
the beauty of a play - based curriculum is that very young children can routinely observe and learn from others ' emotions and experiences			1
skills - based curricula , on the other hand , are sometimes derisively known as " drill and kill " programs because most teachers understand that young children ca n't learn meaningfully in the social isolation required for such an approach			1
how do these approaches look different in a classroom ? preschoolers in both kinds of programs might learn about hibernating squirrels , for example , but in the skills - based program , the child could be asked to fill out a worksheet , counting ( or guessing ) the number of nuts in a basket and coloring the squirrel 's fur			1
in a play - based curriculum , by contrast , a child might hear stories about squirrels and be asked why a squirrel accumulates nuts or has fur			1
the child might then collaborate with peers in the construction of a squirrel habitat , learning not only about number sense , measurement , and other principles needed for engineering , but also about how to listen to , and express , ideas			0
the child filling out the worksheet is engaged in a more one - dimensional task , but the child in the play - based program interacts meaningfully with peers , materials , and ideas			1
programs centered around constructive , teacher - moderated play are very effective			2
for instance , one randomized , controlled trial had 4 - and 5 - year - olds engage in make - believe play with adults and found substantial and durable gains in the ability of children to show self - control and to delay gratification			1
countless other studies support the association between dramatic play and self - regulation			2
through play , children learn to take turns , delay gratification , negotiate conflicts , solve problems , share goals , acquire flexibility , and live with disappointment			2
by allowing children to imagine walking in another person 's shoes , imaginative play also seeds the development of empathy , a key ingredient for intellectual and social - emotional success			1
the real " readiness " skills that make for an academically successful kindergartener or college student have as much to do with emotional intelligence as they do with academic preparation			0
kindergartners need to know not just sight words and lower case letters , but how to search for meaning			0
the same is true of 18 - year - olds			0
as admissions officers at selective colleges like to say , an entire freshman class could be filled with students with perfect grades and test scores			0
but academic achievement in college requires readiness skills that transcend mere book learning			2
it requires the ability to engage actively with people and ideas			0
in short , it requires a deep connection with the world			0
for a five year - old , this connection begins and ends with the creating , questioning , imitating , dreaming , and sharing that characterize play			2
when we deny young children play , we are denying them the right to understand the world			0
by the time they get to college , we will have denied them the opportunity to fix the world too			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 and @entity218 .			1

@entity217 and @entity218 says they see students at @entity19 who have trouble getting along
they say kids better equipped to learn , interact , if taught using play - based curricula
" drill and kill " skill - based learning , requires more social isolation , they say
*writers* : play - based learning builds empathy , better self - control , and problem solving skill
