-- a report detailing the @entity5 's controversial interrogation and detention program after the 9/11 terror attacks will be delayed over the issue of redactions , @entity2 chairman @entity1 said tuesday			1
congressional sources in each party had previously said the report could have been released as early as this week			1
" after further review of the redacted version of the executive summary , i have concluded the redactions eliminate or obscure key facts that support the report 's findings and conclusions			2
until these redactions are addressed to the committee 's satisfaction , the report will not be made public , " @entity1 said in a written statement			1
" i am sending a letter today to the president laying out a series of changes to the redactions that we believe are necessary prior to public release			0
the @entity34 and the intelligence community have committed to working through these changes in good faith			0
this process will take some time , and the report will not be released until i am satisfied that all redactions are appropriate , " she wrote			2
the document that will be released is a nearly 700 - page summary of the full 6,800 - page report that was approved a year and a half ago by a committee sharply divided along party lines			2
senators on the committee have indicated the report is critical of the @entity5 's treatment of terrorism suspects , saying it amounted to torture , something @entity5 officials have denied			1
it also finds that those harsh interrogation techniques did not help disrupt future terrorist attacks as many in the intelligence community have said			0
after the committee voted this spring to release a declassified version to the public , the report was sent to the intelligence community and the @entity34 so classified and other sensitive information could be redacted			0
the report 's creation has been highly controversial , with the @entity5 director apologizing and admitting the agency spied on computers used by @entity2 staffers who prepared the extensive report			1
according to an administration official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , a " constructive dialogue " with the @entity2 about the report is already underway			0
" the bottom line is that the @entity76 must never again make the mistakes documented in this report			0
i believe the best way to accomplish that is to make public our thorough documentary history of the @entity5 's program			1
that is why i believe taking our time and getting it right is so important , and i will not rush this process , " @entity1 said			0
