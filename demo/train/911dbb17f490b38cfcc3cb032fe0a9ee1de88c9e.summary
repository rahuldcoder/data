@entity0 might today be one of @entity3 's top comedians , having the crowd in stitches every time he performs , but things were quite different when he first took to the stage			1
in fact , @entity0 's debut performance was so bad that he had to be stopped straight away			1
" my first joke ... they switched off the mic , " recalls @entity0 , who is better known by his stage name " @entity0 "			1
" it was too boring , " he admits laughingly , " even [ to ] myself			0
" we left the stage and we promised ourselves never to do comedy again , but i went back and with practice and a lot of encouragement , we just found ourselves getting addicted to the stage and that 's exactly what we are doing up until now			0
" ' next @entity24 ' as the old saying goes , if at first you do n't succeed , try , try again			0
and to @entity0 's credit , he did and today , thanks to his hard work and determination , he is at the helm of two of @entity3 's biggest comedy shows : @entity35 and @entity36			1
the first one is more of a magazine show , with several high - profile guests , whilst the latter serves as a platform for up - and - coming performers to showcase their talents			1
to find the best entertainers , @entity0 auditions a group of comedians , and the cream of the crop goes on to perform before a live audience later that day			1
" there is nothing as exciting as being a pioneer for a big dream , not only for one country , but the whole continent and creating history and influencers -- it 's the most amazing thing , " says @entity0			1
" with the talent that you see coming up on the stage every day , in the next five years you might be sure , it 's a matter of time before you see a @entity24 or a @entity66 coming from the academy and that would be the dream , " he muses			2
tips to tickle you but what does it take to succeed in the business of making people laugh ? for @entity0 , the secret lies with crafting jokes that everyone can relate to			2
" the most unique thing is being able to make a very intelligent person and the ordinary person get the joke at the same time otherwise you will lose , " he advises			0
" it is not easy , " he adds			0
" humor is based on current issues and observation and just characters , " continues the seasoned comic , " so it 's a whole journey seven days a week ; you have to keep on doing it , again and again			0
" comedy is not easy , it 's really more like a calling			0
if someone has that talent , the best you can do as a parent is to encourage that person			0
" more than just a comedian , @entity0 is today focused on growing the next generation of comic talent in @entity3 and beyond			1
