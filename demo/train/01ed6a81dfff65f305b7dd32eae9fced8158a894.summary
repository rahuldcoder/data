-- as the year draws to a close , it 's not the promise of a new year that brings us the most joy			1
no , it 's the chance to reflect on the past year 's most memorable work stories that gives us the most delight			1
this year 's selection of workplace tales ranges from ingenious to inspiring to just plain weird , but they all left their own special mark on pop culture			1
so without further ado , we present you with our roundup of the weirdest and most notable work stories of 2011			2
his " winning " remarks caused him to lose his job over the past several years , actor @entity26 has made headlines for his destructive behavior , short - lived marriages and alleged substance abuse			1
yet despite the steady drum of rumors and allegations , he continued to show up and dutifully film his tv show , " @entity33			1
" that is until he had his meltdown			2
while the seedlings of chaos began to sprout at the end of 2010 , things took a turn for the worse in early january , when he was rushed to the hospital for " stomach pains			2
" from there , @entity26 became the center of media attention , making news for his bizarre behavior , crazy rants and admittedly addictive catch phrases			1
there was constant speculation over whether the show would drop him , and he was eventually fired after blasting the show 's creator			1
while @entity26 has since cleaned up his act , those few months of insanity are ones we wo n't soon forget			1

@entity62 's cube expert , prom king and other ways to stand out in your cover letter there 's no shortage of advice on how to develop an effective cover letter , but job seeker @entity71 took some of that advice to the extreme			1
yes , a cover letter should be attention - grabbing , but using profanity and listing one of his qualities as honorable because he is " the son of a librarian and a @entity82 " may be pushing it			2
needless to say it 's an entertaining read , and it impressed the cover letter 's recipients ( @entity90 bar @entity91 ) enough to get him a job			1

the homeless man with that " golden voice " what started as a videotaped interview of a homeless man by @entity103 ( @entity102 ) dispatch videographer @entity101 soon turned into a widespread @entity105 sensation			0
the man in the video , @entity106 , had a voice any radio or tv announcer would kill for			0
in fact , earlier in his life , before falling on hard times , he 'd attended school for voice acting and did some work in radio			0
after the video went viral , @entity106 began receiving job offers and even appeared on @entity120 's " today			1
" yet the sudden media attention was too much for him to bear , and he reverted to drinking and other destructive behavior			0
while the hoopla has since died down , the homeless man with the silky smooth voice wo n't soon be forgotten			0

playing around on the internet really can get you a job sure , you 've been told to " follow your dreams " and " do something you love , " but it 's never really that easy , right ? for one @entity136 native , it was			1
the @entity137 launched a voting contest to name the team 's new mascot but did n't use social media to promote it			1
so self - described " social media sponge " @entity142 took it upon himself to create @entity144 handles for the three mascot finalists			0
at first , the team shied away from the extra social media help , asking @entity142 to hand over the @entity144 handles and back away from @entity144			0
but the ceo soon realized there was a real opportunity to grow the team 's social media presence , and ultimately offered @entity142 a social media position with the team			1

a cop who did n't want to be late @entity161 police officer @entity160 led other officers on a high - speed chase , all in the name of getting to work on time			0
while @entity160 's dedication to punctuality is appreciated , one can only assume his employer would have preferred he arrive 20 minutes late over getting arrested			2

oops i ( phone ) did it again in last year 's roundup of notable workplace stories , we included the tale of the iphone 4 prototype that went missing after its owner left it at a bar			1
clearly no lessons were learned from that gaffe , because another @entity182 employee made the same mistake with the @entity185 prototype , losing it at a @entity187 restaurant			2
and at least the @entity188 was sold for the worthy amount of $ 5,000			0
allegedly the @entity185 archetype raked in a measly $ 200 on @entity191			0
hopefully the next @entity185 iteration will be kept under lock and key			0

gossiping about your co-workers ? use personal email we 've all had those days when we 've needed to vent to a fellow co-worker			0
but doing so continuously , and over company email , may not be the best move			0
three @entity205 employees learned that lesson the hard way after their boss discovered thousands of their gossipy interoffice emails			1
within these emails , the employees in question trashed their co-workers and expressed their general disgust for their jobs			0
after the disparaging emails were exposed , the employees were fired for " excessive use of the commission 's computer system for emails of a personal nature			1
" so the next time you need to let off steam about your workplace , stick to doing so via your personal email account			2

the wrong way to engage employees finding fun and creative ways to engage employees is a good thing , right ? not if that includes hosting a contest to guess the next employee to get the boot			2
the owner of a chain of @entity205 convenience stores did just that , encouraging employees to predict the next cashier to be fired for a chance to win a whopping $ 10 in cash			1
do you think any of the employees guessed themselves as the next victim ? [ source : on deadline ] there you have it -- your 2011 workplace year in review			1
here 's to hoping 2012 brings even more crazy workplace tales			1
i have a feeling we wo n't be disappointed			0
