-- tank warfare in the final days of @entity2 sounds like primo escapism for action freaks			1
" @entity8 , " written and directed with exacting skill and aching heart by @entity11 ( " @entity12 " ) , does n't let us off easy with video game violence			0
@entity11 thrusts us into the furnace of the @entity8 , a @entity15 tank commanded by @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , until we feel as battered as the crew			2
@entity17 : from @entity19 to a-lister in their years with sgt. @entity22 , gunner @entity23 ( an outstanding @entity24 ) , loader @entity25 ( @entity27 ) and driver @entity28 ( @entity29 ± a ) have tilted their moral compass to view murder as different from killing the enemy			1
they do n't even see the blood on their hands until the arrival of @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , a rookie driver unprepared for combat			2
@entity39 's horror and disgust are a cracked mirror for the crew , until @entity39 hardens just like his band of brothers			2
@entity11 captures the buried feelings of men in combat with piercing immediacy			0
fall movie preview : finally , the good stuff ! @entity17 is tremendous in his role , a conscience detectable even in @entity22 's blinkered gaze			1
but it 's @entity40 who anchors the film with a shattering , unforgettable portrayal of corrupted innocence			1
" @entity8 " means to grab us hard from the first scene and never let go			0
