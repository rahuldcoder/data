-- they have barely met , lead lives a world apart and did not speak for two years			2
but @entity4 has made @entity6 cry , and @entity6 has given @entity4 hope			1
@entity4 is a 13 - year - old @entity8 girl			1
@entity6 is an @entity10 champion ski racer , one of the finest the @entity12 has ever produced			1
the story begins in Ã … re , @entity8 , in december 2012			1
a night slalom , under the lights , five days before @entity16			2
@entity6 , then 17 years old , raced to her first - ever @entity18 victory that night			1
in the whirlwind of celebrations , interviews and emotion that followed , she would have every reason to forget the details			2
@entity4 was also having the night of her life in @entity27 … re. profoundly sick with leukemia , the 11 - year - old had been brought to the race by a charity looking to give her a break from chemotherapy			1
at the end of the night , @entity4 had the chance to attend @entity6 's post-race press conference			1
" i remember it really well , " says @entity6 , two years on			1
" my first @entity18 win was such a special time for me			2
i remember doing the press conference , doing the award ceremony , and then immediately meeting @entity4			1
" i remember seeing her in her cute little hat			2
every little detail of that meeting is so clear			2
" a seriously ill , young skiing fan thrust into the heart of the action , @entity4 gingerly waited until most people had left before summoning the courage to ask @entity6 for a picture			1
" her mother offered to take the photo so my whole family could be in the picture			2
i told @entity6 that i had cancer , and she was interested and understanding			1
she was so humble , " says @entity4			1
@entity6 's mother , @entity57 , had just seen @entity6 become the second - youngest @entity12 woman ever to win a @entity18			1
her teenage daughter was now a bona fide skiing sensation			2
" there was so much commotion going on , " says @entity57			2
" but this was one of those things that just stops you in your tracks			0
this poor mom , she had tears in her eyes			0
and when she told me that @entity4 was going to be undergoing treatment for cancer , i just - about died			1
" we were walking away when @entity6 said , ' oh , i should give my winners ' bouquet to @entity4			1
' so she ran back to find her and that was when the mom just broke down and started crying			0
i ca n't even imagine being in that boat			0
" " my heart melted and i could n't stop the tears , " @entity4 's mother , @entity80 , says now			1
" i looked at @entity6 and i looked at her mother , and i was just happy			1
" ' thinking the worst ' on january 24 , 2011 , @entity80 had received unthinkable news : both her husband and her daughter had cancer			0
the diagnoses came on the same morning			0
@entity4 had leukemia and her father , @entity90 , had a brain tumor that was growing again			1
he had been fighting it since 2003			0
the two people you love most in the world , " says @entity80 , 40			0
@entity90 's tumor is now inoperable			0
the 41 - year - old , a former @entity99 skier , had been the initial inspiration for daughter @entity4 's love of the sport			1
when she met @entity6 , she came away with a new hero			1
" it meant the world to me , " says @entity4 , speaking perfect @entity105			1
" it meant so much			0
it was so generous of her , and she was so good - hearted			0
it was a short meeting but it will stay in my mind and my heart forever			0
" " @entity4 really resonated with me , " says @entity6			1
" but as time went by , both my mom and i were honestly thinking -- you know -- what 's the worst that can happen , essentially			0
maybe she 's not around any more			0
" which is obviously pretty morbid			0
you 're thinking of the worst			0
" almost two years later , @entity6 has become an @entity10 champion and one of the most recognizable faces in skiing			1
in october 2014 , @entity6 is nearing the end of a punishing interview schedule -- fighting back jet - lag in the @entity128 -- when a journalist from @entity130 , a @entity8 newspaper , asks her to watch a video on his laptop			1
healthy , happy @entity4 , with a video message for her idol ( it had been the newspaper 's idea )			1
@entity6 gasps as the teenager begins to talk			1
" you gave me the energy to carry on , " @entity4 tells her in the message , " to keep fighting to beat the cancer			1
" today , i 'm not on chemotherapy any more			0
i got my hair back and i 'm feeling stronger , day by day			0
" eye - opening experience @entity6 is wiping away tears as the video finishes			1
@entity147 , who was in the room when @entity6 saw the message , could not believe the transformation in the girl they had met two years earlier			1
" she looked amazing , " says @entity57			0
" she looked so different			0
she had no hair when we saw her			0
she was definitely smaller and younger , paler and thinner -- much thinner			0
" so to see her looking so filled - out and rosy - cheeked , with gorgeous , long blonde hair ... i mean , she was beautiful			0
and well - spoken , unbelievable			0
" a month after seeing that message , @entity6 tells @entity0 : " that video brought so many emotions to the surface that i did n't even know i was feeling up until that point			1
" one of my very best friends , growing up , was diagnosed with cancer when we were both 14			0
" it was two years of harsh treatments , complications from the treatments , and then the past couple years he 's been healthy -- but you would never wish that on anybody , especially not as young as @entity4 or my friend			1
" that young , there 's a certain innocence that is immediately taken away when you 're diagnosed with something like cancer			0
that innocence is supposed to be there a little while longer			0
" @entity6 acknowledges she has an important role to play in how she , as a prominent athlete , addresses cancer and supports victims			1
it is not something she had considered , growing up with only ski racing on her mind			2
yet since that first @entity18 win in 2012 , she has met and reached out to a number of other children with cancer			2
" i wanted to race the @entity18 , i loved ski racing and i wanted to be the best in the world			2
and that was it , " she says			0
" i did n't even think about the media , and tv , and interviews			0
that you have to have that side of the sport , in order for it to be a sport			2
" in order for me to actually see @entity18 racing when i was five , my favorite athletes had to go through the whole media round that i 'm doing now			0
" especially in the past couple years , i 've gotten more used to this side of things -- having fans , having young kids out there who think i 'm their idol			0
" sometimes it feels like an obligation , more like a burden , and then i get these eye - opening experiences like meeting @entity4 -- then more than two years later , getting that message			1
" it seems like every year or two , something happens to me that brings me back down to earth , and i should n't be the girl that does n't have time for this			2
" @entity4 's battle goes on : the chemotherapy is over but she will not get the all - clear for four more years			2
doctors say her father will never be healthy again			0
" the chemo was hard and i have lost friends i left in hospital , " says the 13 - year - old			2
" i have seen friends die			0
" today , i feel much better			0
i 'm happy to have my hair back , and i 'm training my fitness to return to normal life and the ski tracks again			2
" @entity6 means so much to me			2
she cared about me , a little girl from a small town in @entity8 , and my fight			1
" her mother , @entity80 , says : " for us , a superstar saw our little daughter and even remembered her , two years later			0
