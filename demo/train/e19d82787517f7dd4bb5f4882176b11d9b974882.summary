-- president @entity1 says the new @entity3 " is not class warfare , " raising once again the question of why he and his party keep rowing back from one of the @entity8 ' most potent arguments			1
they seem to have accepted the @entity11 ' pejorative definition of economic class warfare as an un-american evil			1
as @entity16 points out , middle - income @entity14 ought to be protesting a system in which billionaires like him pay a third to a half of the 33 % tax rate of @entity16 's secretary			1
in fact , nonviolent class struggle over income distribution has a long and beneficial history in this country and most other industrial democracies			1
starting with the rise of the @entity30 in the late 19th century , continuing into the @entity31 and the @entity32 , grabbing for and getting a bigger slice of the economic pie for wage earners has been a major stabilizing force in @entity14 democracy			0
we are now racing in the direction of income polarization and the political instability that inevitably accompanies the contraction of the middle class and a concentration of wealth within a tiny minority			2
based on the numbers , president @entity1 ought to be able to win this argument easily			2
as former president @entity50 pointed out in an interview monday , 10 % of the population have taken 90 % of the benefits of economic growth			0
@entity54 is probably right that it 's time for @entity1 to fire the @entity57 communications team and carry the economic fight to the @entity11			1
it could hardly hurt when the voters who are getting their pockets picked are siding with the @entity11 corporate oligarchs who used to be the @entity8 ' arch - villains			0
in the current journalistic environment only the rich may be greedy without blame , and it is not just @entity67 , but the mainstream media , as well , that parrots the " class warfare " criticism and puts a negative spin on anything that can be called " populism			1
" for their part , @entity75 @entity8 seem allergic to their own president 's advocacy of a minimally fair tax rate on rich individuals and corporations			2
they are also timid about challenging the @entity11 on their myth - making propaganda about " job creators			2
" what evidence can @entity57 speaker @entity84 and @entity86 chair @entity85 produce that repealing bush - era tax rates for couples making more than $ 250,000 and allowing the top marginal tax rates of 33 percent and 35 percent to revert to 36 percent and 39.6 percent next year would prevent corporations and investors from creating jobs ? what can be deduced is that corporations are content to sit on their $ 2 trillion in cash reserves as long as tax breaks and lax regulations make reinvestment for growth a less attractive alternative			1
all @entity102 students are taught " cash is king , " and the banks have taken the slogan so seriously they wo n't even release to credit markets the $ 2 trillion in bailout funds given them as a gift outright			1
the job creators are n't creating anything			2
they 're sitting on every tax - free dollar they can while the sitting is good			0
so how did we get to this point ? something is clearly wrong with @entity119 and the rest of @entity121 when it comes to letting economic self - interest guide their voting			0
the decline of the labor movement , which was a powerful instrument of economic education for the masses , surely must have something to do with it			0
then there is the impact of more than 30 years of conservative distortion of @entity121 's economic vocabulary since @entity137 's election in 1980			0
he showed his party that making vague promises to preserve the " safety net " was smarter politics than tackling the real problems of @entity145 disability , private pension funds and indigent health care			0
by 1984 , the @entity8 nominee , @entity148 , was ridiculed for trying to make campaign themes of " fairness " and " compassion			0
" this history gives one pause about urging @entity1 to argue more openly for fairer distribution of income			1
certainly if we are in a class war over money , only one side is fighting			1
probably not even @entity137 , an @entity160 , expected so complete a turnaround on what used to be called " pocketbook issues			0
" in interviewing a @entity11 guest , @entity165 , @entity164 noted last week that the bottom 50 % of the population owns less than 2.5 % of the nation 's wealth			0
if that 's not the result of class warfare , @entity164 wondered , what is ? put that way , the question seemed momentarily to fluster @entity165 , as if he had not realized how completely the affluent have triumphed			1
finally , @entity165 allowed that maybe some tax fairness could be considered as long as it did n't hurt the job creators			0
no wonder he got thrown out of the @entity11 presidential race , given such blatant advocacy of class warfare against the deserving rich			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity186 : @entity1 , dems run from class warfare notion even though it 's potent issue
he says class struggle over income distribution not un-american , historically beneficial
he says as corporations sit on $ 2 trillion , not reinvesting , dems , media *buy* into job creation myth
@entity184 : if this is class warfare that will bring income equality , only one side is actually fighting
