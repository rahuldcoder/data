a federal civil complaint in @entity1 claims the defendants may have falsified prescriptions , lied to pharmacies and perhaps even broken the law , but they 're not drug runners			1
they 're officials from the @entity7 , responsible for executing death row inmates			2
the complaint , filed in october , is one example of the lengths death - penalty states are willing to go to acquire drugs for lethal injections			1
@entity1 , which declined to comment on the pending case , is among 32 death - penalty states scrambling to find new drug protocols after @entity18 - based manufacturers banned @entity20 prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them , @entity25 - based @entity24 , which manufactures pentobarbital			1
" the states are scrambling to find the drugs , " says @entity26 , executive director of the @entity28 - based @entity27			1
" they want to carry out these executions that they have scheduled , but they do n't have the drugs and they 're changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of executions			1
" states have been forced to try new drug combinations or go to loosely regulated compounding pharmacies that manufacturer variations of the drugs banned by the larger companies			1
the suit against @entity1 alleges the state corrections department falsified a prescription for pentobarbital , including the patient name as " @entity48 , " the warden of the @entity50 " where executions take place , " according to court documents			1
additionally , the drugs were to be sent to " @entity54 , " which , the documents say , " has not existed since 1983			2
" the suit said the pharmacy was unaware of the purpose for the order and when it found out it canceled the order before it was filled			2
in a letter obtained by @entity64 , dated october 4 of this year , @entity60 , which was requested to provide drugs to @entity1 officials says it believed its " information would be kept on the ' down low ' " by the @entity7			1
" the plaintiffs also allege the state did not produce a purchase order , instead using an individual employee 's credit card to make the purchase			0
the pharmacy is asking the @entity7 to return the drugs it sold the state			2
it is unclear whether they have			0
@entity77 , one of the attorneys representing the inmates , said , " we believe that @entity7 's purchase of compounded pentobarbital from @entity82 violates numerous state laws			0
the vast majority of compounded drugs can only be mixed or sold pursuant to a doctor 's prescription			2
@entity7 did not get a prescription for its purchase of compounded drugs			2
there are exceptions to the requirement , but @entity7 's purchase does not qualify for any of them			0
" in september , @entity1 even turned to another state , @entity96 , for a supply of @entity98 , according to documents provided to @entity64 by @entity101 staff attorney @entity100			1
death row inmates say using untested drugs is " cruel and unusual punishment , " and several have filed federal lawsuits to delay executions until drug protocols have been reviewed			1
@entity108 was set to execute @entity109 on thursday using a two - drug cocktail never before used in an execution			0
@entity108 's @entity112 said it " was unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of pentobarbital			0
" instead it was set to use the sedative midazolam and pain - killer hydromorphone in a lethal dosage			0
@entity108 gov. @entity118 stayed @entity120 ' execution this week pending a review of possible organ donation to his family members			0
@entity124 was set to use propofol , the infamous drug from the @entity128 case , in an execution last month , but the governor halted it after he was warned the @entity131 might halt shipments of the drug , leading to shortages for medical purposes			0
@entity136 , a law professor at @entity137 , said a new combination of drugs used in the execution of @entity142 inmate @entity141 last month took 14 minutes to kill him instead of the usual seven			0
" there is absolute chaos among the states , " @entity136 said			0
" so , every few months it seems we see a different state using a different type of drug , or types of drugs			0
" @entity154 , the @entity155 former attorney general of @entity108 , presided over 19 executions but no longer supports the death penalty			1
" an attorney general is bound to follow the statute , " he said			0
" @entity26 said using untested drugs amounts to experimentation on human beings : " they 're guilty people who did these crimes , but that does n't ameliorate our ethical obligations			1
