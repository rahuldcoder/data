-- pre-match handshakes , or the absence of them , overshadowed the eight fixtures in the @entity4 on saturday as the feud between @entity7 defender , @entity6 and @entity9 captain @entity8 continued at @entity10			1
@entity6 ignored @entity8 as both sets of players assembled to shake hands before kick - off in what was the first meeting of the two players since the @entity9 defender was acquitted of racially abusing @entity6 ( younger brother of @entity18 ) by a court in july			1
charges against @entity8 were brought following an incident during the corresponding fixture in october last year			1
@entity23 , who appeared as a character witness for @entity8 at the trail at @entity26 , was also snubbed by @entity6			1
the match itself was predictably lively but yielded no goals			0
@entity9 had the better of the first half with @entity31 and @entity32 both testing @entity33 in @entity7 's goal			2
the home side had their chances in the second half but @entity38 squandered a free header while @entity40 could n't find a shot after rounding keeper @entity42			0
the result was a goalless deadlock which is enough to keep @entity9 at the top of the table with 10 points			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , are struggling in 18th place with only two points from a possible 12			2
elsewhere , the blue and red halves of @entity51 experienced mixed fortunes			0
reigning champions , @entity53 could only manage a 1 - 1 draw away to @entity53 and remain in fourth place			2
but @entity57 are up to second after claiming all three points with a 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity60 at @entity61			1
panel : police at fault in response to deadly @entity68 stadium football crush @entity69 , who was making his 700th appearance for @entity57 , scored the opening goal six minutes into the second half			0
it opened the floodgates , with @entity75 scoring in the 63rd minute and @entity76 adding a third three minutes later			0
teenage striker , @entity77 completed the rout with a thunderous drive eight minutes from the final whistle			0
@entity81 were in fine form against @entity83 at the @entity84 with @entity85 scoring a brace in a 6 - 1 drubbing of @entity83			1
@entity88 and @entity89 were also on target for the @entity91 whose total was boosted by two first - half own goals by @entity83 's @entity95 defender @entity94 and @entity96			1
elsewhere , @entity97 are still searching for their first win of the season after only managing a 1 - 1 draw away to @entity101			0
@entity103 's 71st minute strike canceled out @entity105 's first half goal to lift @entity97 one place to 17th , while @entity108 's side rise to 14th			0
@entity109 recorded their first victory of the season beating high - flying @entity112 2 - 0 at @entity113			2
@entity114 beat @entity115 3 - 0 at @entity116 , while @entity57 drew 0 - 0 against @entity117 at @entity118 .			1
