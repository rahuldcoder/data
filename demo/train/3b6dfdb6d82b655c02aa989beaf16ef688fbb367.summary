-- in print advertisements , which comes first -- the word or the image ? the brief for @entity7 parts and accessories was to encourage more riders to personalize their bikes			1
the popular answer to this question would be either can come first , but i 'm going to stick my neck out and say it 's the visual			2
if for no other reason than to create discussion			0
it does all depend on who is asked and what period of time they worked in advertising , but we 're in 2008			2
i am , after all , an art director , so that may explain my opinion			0
any kind of print advertising should be treated as an art form			1
that 's how it all started many years ago and is still true today at its best			0
print advertising is always so much more interesting when it 's visual			1
it 's a piece of printed medium that is there to be explored , studied and then rewarded			0
my first example for @entity7 parts and accessories does exactly that			2
the brief was to encourage more riders to customize or personalize their bikes			0
quite a simple brief really , but when you 're asking someone to put their artistic stamp on a bike , it 's a little dull to do it through words alone			0
hence , the visual of a face made out of many @entity7 parts and meticulously art - directed at the same time			1
the line " @entity57 " came after the visual idea			1
it 's a good line that acts as a signature to the picture			1
the next example is equally as simple			0
it 's an ad for @entity66 in - car speakers			1
@entity66 makes damn good speakers with an amazing sound , and they wanted to tell everyone that			1
however , everyone talks about sound , and when they do it in print it hardly ever comes over as believable , mainly because a print ad has no sound attached to it ! so rather than talk about the sound , the ad talks about the experience that comes with the sound			1
if you know your music , then you 'll recognize the famous @entity87 album cover " @entity88 '			0
" print advertising can be very effective when it subverts what people already know			1
in this case , the album cover is recognizable , but its context completely changes by looking at it from the point of view of an open top car			0
with clever lighting on the car and fabulous retouching , the car looks like it 's in the street where the album cover was shot			2
the line , " get closer to the music " does all the work in explaining the idea , but the visual does all the emotional heavy - lifting in describing the experience			2
once again , the visual came first			0
as i said at the beginning , opinions will vary and perhaps it 's true that either line or visual can come first , but this is based on my own experiences			2
maybe someone should write a case for the line ?			0

@entity7 's line " @entity57 " acts as a signature to the picture
@entity66 's in - car speakers ad talks about the experience that comes with the sound
