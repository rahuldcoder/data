-- at a security conference recently , the moderator asked the panel of distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare scenario was			2
the answers were the predictable array of large - scale attacks : against our communications infrastructure , against the power grid , against the financial system , in combination with a physical attack			2
i did n't get to give my answer until the afternoon , which was : " my nightmare scenario is that people keep talking about their nightmare scenarios			2
" there 's a certain blindness that comes from worst - case thinking			1
an extension of the precautionary principle , it involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty			2
it substitutes imagination for thinking , speculation for risk analysis and fear for reason			1
it fosters powerlessness and vulnerability and magnifies social paralysis			0
and it makes us more vulnerable to the effects of terrorism			1
worst - case thinking means generally bad decision making for several reasons			1
first , it 's only half of the cost - benefit equation			1
every decision has costs and benefits , risks and rewards			0
by speculating about what can possibly go wrong , and then acting as if that is likely to happen , worst - case thinking focuses only on the extreme but improbable risks and does a poor job at assessing outcomes			1
second , it 's based on flawed logic			2
it begs the question by assuming that a proponent of an action must prove that the nightmare scenario is impossible			0
third , it can be used to support any position or its opposite			0
if we build a nuclear power plant , it could melt down			0
if we do n't build it , we will run short of power and society will collapse into anarchy			0
if we allow flights near @entity80 's volcanic ash , planes will crash and people will die			1
if we do n't , organs wo n't arrive in time for transplant operations and people will die			2
if we do n't invade @entity86 , @entity85 might use the nuclear weapons he might have			0
if we do , we might destabilize the @entity88 , leading to widespread violence and death			0
of course , not all fears are equal			0
those that we tend to exaggerate are more easily justified by worst - case thinking			1
so terrorism fears trump privacy fears , and almost everything else ; technology is hard to understand and therefore scary ; nuclear weapons are worse than conventional weapons ; our children need to be protected at all costs ; and annihilating the planet is bad			2
basically , any fear that would make a good movie plot is amenable to worst - case thinking			1
fourth and finally , worst - case thinking validates ignorance			1
instead of focusing on what we know , it focuses on what we do n't know -- and what we can imagine			2
remember defense secretary @entity114 's quote ? " reports that say that something has n't happened are always interesting to me , because as we know , there are known knowns ; there are things we know we know			2
we also know there are known unknowns ; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know			0
but there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we do n't know we do n't know			0
" and this : " the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence			0
" ignorance is n't a cause for doubt ; when you can fill that ignorance with imagination , it can be a call to action			0
even worse , it can lead to hasty and dangerous acts			2
you ca n't wait for a smoking gun , so you act as if the gun is about to go off			0
rather than making us safer , worst - case thinking has the potential to cause dangerous escalation			1
the new undercurrent in this is that our society no longer has the ability to calculate probabilities			0
probabilistic thinking is repudiated in favor of " possibilistic thinking " : since we ca n't know what 's likely to go wrong , let 's speculate about what can possibly go wrong			2
worst - case thinking leads to bad decisions , bad systems design , and bad security			1
and we all have direct experience with its effects : airline security and the @entity170 , which we make fun of when we 're not appalled that they 're harassing 93 - year - old women or keeping first - graders off airplanes			1
you ca n't be too careful ! actually , you can			0
you can refuse to fly because of the possibility of plane crashes			0
you can lock your children in the house because of the possibility of child predators			0
you can eschew all contact with people because of the possibility of hurt			0
@entity188 wants to avoid trying to communicate with aliens because they might be hostile ; does he want to turn off all the planet 's television broadcasts because they 're radiating into space ? it is n't hard to parody worst - case thinking , and at its extreme it 's a psychological condition			1
@entity196 , a sociology professor at the @entity197 , writes : " worst - case thinking encourages society to adopt fear as one of the dominant principles around which the public , the government and institutions should organize their life			1
it institutionalizes insecurity and fosters a mood of confusion and powerlessness			0
through popularizing the belief that worst cases are normal , it incites people to feel defenseless and vulnerable to a wide range of future threats			1
" even worse , it plays directly into the hands of terrorists , creating a population that is easily terrorized -- even by failed terrorist attacks like the @entity224 underwear bomber and the @entity226 suv bomber			1
when someone is proposing a change , the onus should be on them to justify it over the status quo			0
but worst case thinking is a way of looking at the world that exaggerates the rare and unusual and gives the rare much more credence than it deserves			1
it is n't really a principle ; it 's a cheap trick to justify what you already believe			0
it lets lazy or biased people make what seem to be cogent arguments without understanding the whole issue			1
and when people do n't need to refute counterarguments , there 's no point in listening to them			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			1

@entity254 says worst - case security planning focuses on unlikely as though it 's certain
he says it 's a blunt *intrument* that *distorts* risk analysis , plays to terrorists , makes us fearful
this , he says , leads to bad , dangerous decisions and *policies* that leave us vulnerable
@entity254 : it lets biased people make seemingly good arguments without understanding issue
