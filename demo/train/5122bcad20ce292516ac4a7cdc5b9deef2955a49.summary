@entity0 , @entity1 -- the family of a missing @entity1 baby continued to make news friday , cutting ties with its attorney hours after canceling a police interview with the girl 's two half - brothers			1
@entity13 , the attorney who had been speaking for the family of 11 - month - old @entity15 , is no longer working with the family , her @entity0 , @entity1 , law firm announced friday in a statement			1
there was no immediate indication as to who , if anyone , will represent the family instead			2
meanwhile , @entity0 police captain @entity23 said late thursday that the @entity14 's lawyer -- at that point , presumed to be short -- had canceled a police interview with the girl 's two older brothers			1
the boys , ages 8 and 6 , were in the family 's @entity0 home when the girl was reported missing on october 4			1
they were previously interviewed just after she disappeared , both for less than an hour , @entity0 police capt. @entity23 said			2
the " nonconfrontational " re-interview planned for friday would have been conducted by a child services specialist without a police officer in the room , according to @entity23			2
" ( it 's ) not an interrogation , " he said			0
" they are kids , after all			0
" it was unclear whether the boys ' interviews will be rescheduled			0
authorities have also said they are seeking tests on the boys , in order to eliminate them from all the dna found in the home during a search			1
police have said the infant 's parents , @entity15 and @entity15 , will not submit to separate interviews			1
but @entity13 , speaking earlier as the couple 's attorney , disputed that account			2
" being questioned separately is not the issue , " @entity13 said			0
she said the couple has been cooperative and has been interviewed separately as well as together			0
they do n't mind being interviewed separately as long as the detectives are fair , open - minded and nonaccusatory , she said			0
@entity64 was reported missing about 4 a.m. october 4 , after her father arrived home from work to find the door unlocked , the lights on and a window tampered with			1
the girl 's mother said she last saw @entity64 at 6:40 p.m. the previous day			2
a cadaver dog searching the family 's @entity0 home indicated a positive " hit " for the scent of a body , police said			1
on that information , @entity13 said law enforcement typically begins such investigations inside the home , and then , if warranted , the inquiry moves outside the family			0
" we do n't know exactly what happened here , so we need to keep broadening the investigation , " she said			0
@entity2 's @entity90 and @entity91 contributed to this report .			0
