-- during election season , phones across the country ring with more unsolicited , automated calls than usual			2
so it 's especially timely that on thursday the @entity6 held a @entity7 to " explore innovations designed to trace robocalls , prevent wrongdoers from faking caller id data , and stop unwanted calls			1
" a " robocall " is an automated phone call that plays a prerecorded message			2
if you hear a live person and it 's a telemarketing , advocacy , or survey call , it could still be illegal if it 's unsolicited , but it 's not a robocall			1
robocalls from political campaigns or get - out - the - vote efforts are allowed ( and legal ) under the @entity6 's @entity26 , as well as under most state robocall laws ( except when made to cell phone numbers and a few other exceptions )			1
unsolicited commercial telemarketing calls are illegal , and rampant , in the @entity31 according to new @entity6 statistics , this problem is getting worse , fast			1
in the last year , the number of consumer complaints about unwanted telemarketing calls soared 70 % to an all - time record of 3,840,572 during fiscal year 2012			2
@entity39 up with the phone spam , over 217 million @entity31 have already added themselves to the @entity40			1
but this only solves part of the problem			1
much phone spam comes from companies , groups and scammers that choose to ignore the law			2
also , a large proportion of consumer phone spam complaints can not be investigated because of evasion measures such as " spoofing " -- or hiding -- the originating phone number or caller id information			2
to address the robocall problem , the @entity6 announced a contest at the @entity7 to find technological ways to curb illegal robocalls			1
the @entity59 challenges the public to suggest plans to block illegal robocalls on landlines and mobile phones			1
ideas must include a technical proposal -- so options to , say , prevent caller @entity68 would qualify , but nontechnical suggestions such as " give phone spammers the death penalty " are not eligible			0
the winning solution will receive a $ 50,000 cash prize , as well as opportunities for promotion , exposure , and recognition by the @entity6			1
entrants retain ownership of their proposed solutions			0
if you 're interested in entering , the deadline for entries is january 17 , 2013			0
the winner will be announced april 1 , 2013			0
( hopefully people wo n't think it 's an @entity87 joke			0
) for now , here 's what to do if you get an unsolicited commercial phone call -- whether a robocall or from a live person : 1			0
do not press 1 or any other numbers to get off the list			0
file a complaint with @entity40			0
it helps , but is n't necessary , to have the number from which the call was initiated			0
remember that political and get - out - the - vote robocalls are legal , so there 's no point in filing complaints about these with @entity40			1
however if these calls really annoy you , then you might consider complaining about them to your government representatives			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity114 .			0

the *volume* of illegal robocalls is *increasing* in the @entity31
