ice fishers in @entity1 are reeling from a recent @entity3 decision prohibiting beer delivery by drone			1
local brewery @entity6 was testing a new drone delivery system to airlift frosty cases of beer to fishermen holed up in ice shacks on @entity13			1
after spotting a @entity6 @entity15 video that went up last week of one of the unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity18 ) on a test run , the @entity3 contacted @entity6 and told the company to stop			1
unfortunately for @entity23 fans and anyone else dreading a walk to the corner store , it 's currently against the law to fly drones for commercial purposes or above 400 feet in the @entity30			1
the @entity3 is working on a comprehensive set of rules and regulations that will pave the way for commercial drone flight , but the legislation wo n't be ready until at least 2015 and drones might not be in the skies until 2017			1
until then , thirsty fishermen must obtain their beverages through old - fashioned terrestrial delivery methods			2
the great beer grounding of 2014 might just be the issue that will turn @entity30 into pro-drone advocates			0
a @entity46 petition has already gone up , asking the @entity48 administration to issue @entity6 an airworthiness certificate			0
so far , 183 thirsty @entity18 advocates have signed the petition ( only 99,817 signatures to go ! )			0
@entity53 sen. @entity52 has previously expressed his support of aerial beer delivery on @entity56			1
in august he said " perhaps i am not against all drones ! " and linked to a news story about a drone delivering beers during a music festival in @entity61			2
only amateurs are allowed to fly drones at this time , and they 're limited to small vehicles under 55 pounds			1
they can only operate the aircraft for fun , not for profit , and they must adhere to local and federal laws			0
for example , drones are not allowed to cruise over populated areas			0
some groups have received exceptions to test drones for research purposes			2
" while we are evaluating many potential uses of [ @entity18 ] as we move toward their safe integration into the nation 's airspace , commercial operation of such aircraft is not yet allowed , " said @entity3 spokesperson @entity78 in an e-mail			1
announcing plans to deliver goods by drone has been a popular publicity stunt for @entity30 companies over the past year			0
on a recent " @entity95 " segment , @entity93 demonstrated a drone delivery system it 's working on for packages			1
the company conducted the tests outside the country to avoid breaking @entity30 law			0
in june , the @entity103 's pizza chain said it was developing a drone capable of delivering up to two pizzas			2
the @entity3 has asked other companies and institutions to ground their drones in the past year			1
the agency has contacted a company in @entity111 that used drones to capture aerial footage for real estate			1
and the @entity115 at the @entity116 received a cease - and - desist letter for its attempts to use drones for reporting purposes			0
even once @entity3 regulations are in place , we likely wo n't see the skies filling up with beer deliveries			1
interested companies will have to get proper training and licenses			0
" we are concerned about possible careless and reckless operation , especially if someone on the ground is hurt by an object or objects falling from the [ @entity18 ] , " said @entity129 , citing the @entity3 regulation that prohibits careless flying			2
delivery of goods is expected to be a small segment of future drone market			0
the bigger commercial uses will focus on agriculture , law enforcement and aerial photography			0
delicious test cases like beer and fast - food delivery might be gimmicky , but they can help ease the public 's concerns about drones in the sky			1
the technology is mostly known for its military applications , and civil liberties groups are concerned about drones being used for surveillance by law enforcement			0
local residents in @entity159 , @entity160 , have even attempted to pass a law that makes it legal to shoot down drones with the proper drone hunting license			2
but the next generation of friendly drones are n't all packing weapons or collecting data for the @entity169			0
some just want to bring you a nice cold one and maybe a slice without getting stuck in traffic .			0

@entity111 beer company @entity23 was testing beer delivery by drone for local ice fishermen
the @entity3 has told the company to ground any drones
it 's currently *illegal* to fly the unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes
