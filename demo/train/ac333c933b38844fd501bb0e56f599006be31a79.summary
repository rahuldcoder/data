you might have been forgiven for not knowing there is an election around @entity3 , starting on thursday , to elect 751 members of the @entity5 , known as @entity6			1
there are 751 seats from 28 countries up for grabs			2
nearly 400 million @entity3 are eligible to vote			1
extreme parties on the left , and more noticeable , on the right , are expected to poll very well			0
it seems the angry are most likely to make the effort to vote , from @entity17 to @entity18			0
the @entity5 gained more power in the @entity20			0
it certainly does not have the legislative power of a national parliament , but it has the power to pressure @entity23			0
in theory it even has the power to " elect " the next @entity26 president ( though heads of state / government can also ignore who parliament chooses			0
is n't @entity3 fun ? )			1
during the last vote , in 2009 , the @entity31 came in second to the now ruling @entity34 -- both parties are full of euroskeptics -- and @entity31 became a force in @entity39 politics			1
if you believe polls , @entity31 could come in first in thursday 's vote			1
the difference this time around is that the party has been under heavy scrutiny about his anti-immigration stance , about its controversial leader @entity49 and about its desire for the @entity39 to actually pull out of the @entity51 -- which of course would put its meps out of work			1
that 's because @entity31 does not have one single seat in @entity57 , the @entity39 's national parliament			0
but @entity31 is tapping into a feeling that is also benefiting parties on the extreme left -- that @entity23 has lost its way			2
while rightist parties want to cut @entity51 budgets , cut its influence , or simply cut it all up and throw it away , those on the left have been pushing hard to end the austerity drive driven by @entity23			1
they want to see spending to cut @entity3 's biggest disease : unemployment			2
both extremes are benefiting from drag on @entity3 following the economic crisis which was followed by the @entity76			2
@entity3 are sick of it all and have every right to express their displeasure through the ballot box			2
so , will it make a difference ? yes , but maybe not in obvious ways			0
the bigger the vote for the extremes , the more likely the middle parties will have to work together to form a voting bloc			1
@entity88 of @entity89 calls it the " big soft " center			0
the second influence by the fringe parties will be how far they push national governments to the left or the right , depending			1
some ruling parties have already embraced their left party 's call to end austerity and spend their way back to health			0
other ruling parties have talked about cracking down on immigrants and other bogeymen , real or imagined			0
so , the rise of the fringe can influence @entity3 for the next five years simply by being who they are and making their voice at every turn , even if they ca n't really vote as a bloc			1
you see , if there is one thing the fringe have in common in @entity3 , they are far from united			2
every time one of them sticks their foot into it , the others have to at least pretend to be aghast and to pull away			0
the more seats the rightest parties gain from next week , the more likely the battle between @entity126 of the @entity128 's @entity127 and @entity49 of @entity31 for dominance will split the base			0
no unity from the right is expected			0
now , if i am wrong and the right can form a useable bloc to block @entity23 at every turn , then the @entity3 elections will prove to have been more important than most people could ever imagine			1

the @entity3 elections begins thursday , and 400 million voters are eligible to vote across 28 @entity51 member states
the protest parties have been rising in *popularity* , but they are unlikely to have influence , as @entity154 writes
they are more likely to push the middle parties together -- creating a more moderate centrist bloc
