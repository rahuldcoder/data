-- @entity2 's $ 2 billion purchase of @entity3 , which makes virtual reality headsets , is bad news for small investors and @entity8 's innovation ecology			1
the deal means we will never have the chance to own @entity3 stock			1
this is the latest instance of a shift in the tech sector that reduces would - be investors to mere consumers			1
for decades , @entity8 's culture was built around small startups that counted on " going public " -- listing their shares in an initial public offering			1
the resulting @entity24 provided working capital to the founders and allowed ordinary investors to buy into the dream -- and prospect of a financial upside			0
@entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 and others went this route			0
ordinary investors could participate by holding a stake in the companies they liked			0
this also made it possible for a steady stream of tech upstarts to grow into independent tech giants with diverse products and services			1
early employees at successful startups would then use their new - ipo wealth to depart and launch the next wave of companies			2
this ipo model began to erode after the dot - com bubble burst when the market became riskier			1
at the same time , the dot - com survivors were increasingly flush with cash and in an arms race to ensure growth			0
buying early - stage companies was an easy way to gather new technologies , businesses , patents -- and top - notch entrepreneurial brains			0
the shift came into sharp focus in 2006 when @entity34 bought @entity67			2
founded by three @entity69 employees in 2005 , @entity67 was less than two years old when @entity34 paid the then - unheard sum of $ 1.65 billion to turn it into a @entity34 subsidiary			2
this was good news for @entity34 , but we will never know what @entity67 might have become had it remained independent			0
sure , investors can participate by owning @entity34 stock , but might @entity67 stock have done even better if allowed to fly on its own ? grabbing companies before they go public also impoverishes the variety of products that come to market			0
imagine if @entity84 had been acquired in the early 1980s during its infancy by @entity86 or @entity87 ? would there ever have been a @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 or @entity89 ? now that @entity2 owns @entity3 , will it allow users to wear their goggles when visiting virtual worlds in @entity97 or watch movies from @entity99 ? with nest -- acquired recently by @entity34 for $ 3.2 billion -- will @entity92 users get the same level of interaction with their home thermostat as @entity106 users ? while some companies like @entity32 have shown remarkable restraint in allowing their acquired subsidiaries to operate independently , the temptation to tweak products for differential advantage is compelling , particularly when the price tag is in the billions of dollars			1
instead of an eclectic field of many companies of all sizes , the new landscape is becoming dominated by a few goliaths whose cherry - picking among the small startups all but eliminates the population of mid-sized companies with significant future ipo and innovation potential			2
worse yet , employees in the acquired startups who find themselves in secure , lavishly - paid positions at companies like @entity2 are less likely to strike out on their own			2
and even if they do manage to break out and create a new company , their focus will be on the quick kill of getting acquired by a giant in a year or two , not on embarking on the multi-year road of creating a potentially world - changing product			0
the future of tech sector dominated by the acquisition trend reminds me of the final scene of the movie " @entity145 " after a nail - biting , continent - spanning race to find a mystical and vastly powerful artifact , the last the audience sees of the now boxed - up @entity146 is its disappearance into a vast warehouse of identical crates			1
we know the @entity146 will never see the light of day again and are left to wonder at what else might be hidden and gathering dust alongside it			0
in the case of @entity3 , we might enjoy the immersive pleasure of head - mounted displays , but even that will not be enough to keep me from wondering what might have been if @entity3 , @entity101 and all the other startups gobbled up by giants like @entity2 and @entity34 had been allowed to grow into independent companies owned by ordinary investors like you and me			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity168 : @entity2 's $ 2 billion purchase of @entity3 is a bad deal for consumers
@entity168 : tech sector is seeing a shift from ipo model to acquisition model
he says it 's *harmful* for @entity8 innovation ecology if tech giants grab up startups
@entity168 : imagine if @entity84 had been bought by @entity86 or @entity87 , would there ever be @entity92 ?
