-- in politics , we 're all used to seeing various " cards " being played to fire up voters and gain the upper hand			0
the most popular is the " race card , " but there are others in the deck , such as the " @entity10 card , " the " gender card " and the " immigration card			2
" but @entity14 took the card game to a whole new level this past weekend when he whipped out the hardly used , rarely seen " @entity18 card			1
" speaking to a church in @entity21 , @entity19 criticized president @entity22 for apologizing to the @entity24 people for the accidental burning of @entity26 at a military base -- an incident that spurred riots and dozens of deaths in retaliation			1
the former @entity33 speaker told the congregation that president @entity18 would not have apologized " to those who are killing us			1
" now , besides the fact @entity22 did not apologize " to those who are killing us " or that our generals also apologized for the mistake or that the @entity42 asks @entity43 to forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us -- i 'm trying to figure out who , besides a " @entity48 ! " contestant , whips out a @entity18 card in the first place ? that 's the problem with @entity19 and the other @entity54 challengers			1
it seems they have mistaken their base 's fervor to defeat @entity22 for a fervor to hear them pander			1
remember @entity19 's moon base speech while he was campaigning near @entity63 ? or @entity64 quoting " @entity71 " while in @entity65 , saying : " if you count corn as an amber wave of grain , why , you have them right here			1
what a wonderful place this is			0
" seriously , who says that ? the @entity54 's once credible attacks on the president 's record have morphed into an incredible attack on the country 's intelligence			1
that change is reflected by @entity22 's double - digit lead over the @entity54 field			1
while " amber waves of grain " is pretty bad , i thought @entity64 showing up in @entity88 last fall saying , " the trees are the right height			0
the grass is the right color for this time of year , kind of a brownish - greenish sort of thing			0
it just feels right , " was as low as pandering could go			0
then he showed up in @entity97 a couple of days ago and repeated that the " trees are the right height			0
" hurling out chunks of red meat at a rally is a longstanding practice			0
massaging a position to suit the polls , or support the party , is something voters do n't like , but we understand the rationale			2
but telling a crowd you love their trees and dead grass ? ridiculous			0
granted , some of us are gullible enough to give each other high - fives because @entity118 called @entity22 a snob for promoting a college education			1
but the rest of us look at " @entity122 's " college degree , law degree and @entity125 , the fact that he 's sending his kids to college and owns at least six properties , and has earned millions , and wonder -- what is he talking about ? virtually every socioeconomic study looking at the intersection of income and education shows a direct correlation between the two			0
for @entity118 to vilify higher education for political gain -- while obviously benefiting from attending universities -- is embarrassing			1
then saying that @entity142 's famous 1960 speech standing up for the separation of church and state made him want to throw up ? well , that makes me nauseous			0
sometimes it seems as if @entity118 and the others are content with pushing each other closer and closer to the edge of idiocy because that 's easier than pushing ideas to convince voters they 're the best person for the job			1
it 's a tactic that might be fine for early cheers in february but will run out of steam the longer this process goes			0
usually , a tough primary makes a candidate stronger for the general election , but between the exposure of character flaws and this dumbing - down of rhetoric , it seems to be having the reverse effect on the @entity54			2
in november , a @entity168 poll showed then - front - runner @entity64 was leading @entity22 53 % -41 % among independents			2
now , @entity22 's up 51 % -42 % , and the president has n't even started campaigning aggressively			2
given some of the disconnected lunacy already heard during the primary , there 's no telling what the candidates think they have to say to prove their tea party street cred and lock down the nomination			1
i do n't know about you , but i have lost my ability to be surprised by the things that come out of these candidates ' mouths			0
i am fully prepared to hear @entity118 refer to @entity22 as the @entity186 , only to be one - upped the next day by someone calling @entity22 the super-duper , most evil anti-christ ever -- fo ' real			1
but apparently it 's the way this field has chosen to play			0
which is why in the eyes of many , they have already lost the game			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 says @entity54 candidates are falling over each other to pander to base
@entity19 pulls " @entity18 " card ; @entity118 calls @entity22 a snob on education , he says
@entity199 : they *'d* rather push to the edge of lunacy than offer real reasons to vote for them
*strategy* of proving tea party cred in *extreme* ways is *backfiring* , @entity199 says
