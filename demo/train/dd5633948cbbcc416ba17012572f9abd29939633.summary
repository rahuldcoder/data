@entity0 -- three summers ago , my wife and i were settling into a short summer holiday when i received an unexpected phone call from the police chief in @entity8 , the part of @entity0 where i grew up and now represent in the @entity11 @entity10			1
phone calls from police officers are not uncommon in my line of work , but when the chief 's number appeared on my screen i knew this was serious			1
the voice at the other end of the phone informed me that a black man had been shot dead by armed police in my constituency			1
i knew immediately that i had to return home , and jumped on the first train back the following morning			0
i arrived back in time to watch as fire and unrestrained violence tore through my favorite local cafes and shops , and shattered glass covered the streets i have walked on all my life			0
the @entity38 just yards from the house in which i grew up was engulfed in flames , with homes set alight and buildings ransacked			0
this was the start of four nights of rioting , looting and widespread disturbance that made international headlines and wreaked havoc in communities across @entity52			0
watching the live footage coming out of @entity54 , @entity55 , has brought these memories flooding back			1
5 things to know about the @entity59 shooting while there are differences between the @entity8 riots and events in @entity54 , the similarities are stark			1
@entity59 is not @entity27 , but he is yet another black man controversially shot dead by police			1
the police officers have different uniforms and the rioters different accents , but the sense of distance and distrust between them is all too familiar			1
and the human cost of rioting -- the businesses destroyed , homes damaged and relationships shattered -- transcends all borders			0
soon the violence will stop , the streets will empty and the broken glass will be quietly swept away			0
as a degree of normality returns to this @entity55 town , journalists will drift away and the tv cameras will move on			0
what will be left is a deeply scarred and divided community			2
the distrust and anger that is compounded by these type of events endures long after public attention has turned away			0
healing these divisions will take time , money and commitment			2
what is crucial is that @entity54 is not left to deal with this alone			1
when a community so publicly fractures in the most devastating of circumstances , it needs outside help to heal			1
after the violence in @entity0 stopped , the mayor and the government committed to a series of reviews , commissions and repair funds that would take place over the coming months			1
while these were not entirely effective , they did ensure that the needs of the community were not simply forgotten			2
a damaged community being left to its own devices , with no one to mediate the anger and accusations between different parties , is not a recipe for progress			2
much of this work will focus on repairing the relationship between the police and the communities they operate in			2
police forces can operate only with the consent of those that they are policing ; deep distrust in the police puts that at risk			2
the first part of this process will involve establishing the truth about what lead to @entity59 's death , and bringing any wrongdoers to justice			0
but the protesters on @entity54 's streets know that @entity59 was not the first young black man shot dead in controversial circumstances , and nor will he be the last			1
deeper , more long - term fixes are required			0
this will require serious effort on both sides to rebuild and move forward			0
@entity0 's current police commissioner , @entity151 , knew this when he committed to virtually abolishing the controversial and divisive practice of stop and search			1
so too did @entity157 mayor @entity156 when he focused his election campaign on the problems caused by its transatlantic cousin : stop and frisk			0
similar leadership will be needed in @entity55			0
my experience suggests that , with time , police - community relations can be rebuilt			1
in @entity8 , problems remain but the divisions are nowhere near as deep as they once were			0
the solutions , though , must go deeper than police reform			2
what became clear from speaking to those who had been involved in the august 2011 @entity11 riots was a sense of alienation -- an awareness that these people felt they had nothing to lose			1
they were rebelling not just against the local police but against a society they felt they had no stake in			2
it was , on the whole , those without a job , an education or the hope of a brighter future who were most likely to risk a jail sentence for the sake of a new pair of @entity194 trainers			0
more must be done , through employment , education , urban regeneration and community programs , to integrate these groups with the rest of society			2
so , too , should we address the problems that have arisen from the social revolution of the 1960s and the economic liberal revolution of the 1980s			0
liberalism has made our societies fairer and more tolerant , but in excess it leads to a hyper - individualism that trumps our shared interests and makes us aware of our rights but not our responsibilities			2
both in @entity8 and in @entity54 , legitimate protesters were joined by an opportunistic minority			1
in @entity0 , people who had never heard of @entity27 rushed down to @entity217 to grab whatever looted trainers they could lay their hands on			1
whole families were caught on @entity221 making off with widescreen televisions robbed from electronics stores			0
this sense of entitlement , together with an absence of responsibility or the ability to delay gratification , was also present in pre-crash @entity230 and in the @entity232 boardroom ; it has been very visible in recent years at both ends of society			0
since the 2011 @entity11 riots , similar disturbances have taken place in @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and the @entity243			1
while the immediate anger usually forms around a particular event or a specific government policy , all of these events stem from much deeper and more fundamental issues that continue to rumble below the surface in communities across the developed world			0
every now and then we see an eruption , as in @entity54			1
it is a sign of the fractures that have emerged in our societies			1
we should not allow ourselves to think that they are nothing more than isolated events			0

@entity11 mp says @entity54 will need outside help to heal
he represents area of @entity0 hit by riots in 2011 after black man killed by police
@entity278 says healing goes far beyond rebuilding trust between police and community
and he says riots are a sign of the fractures in our societies
