@entity0 , @entity1 -- criminals across the country are raking in billions of dollars in tax refunds through a new and brazen form of fraud that takes advantage of the @entity11 's fast online returns , law enforcement officials say			1
using laptops and free @entity15 connections , criminals are stealing identities and using the names of legitimate taxpayers to file fraudulent online tax returns			1
they 've raked in billions , buying luxury cars , expensive jewelry and plastic surgery , police said			2
" it 's like the federal government is putting crack cocaine in candy machines , " said detective @entity24 of the @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity25			0
" it 's that easy			0
" first , thieves obtain @entity33 numbers and other personal information from insiders at hospitals , doctor 's offices , car dealerships or anywhere the information is stored			2
then , they file an online tax return using the real taxpayer 's name and a fictitious income			1
in most cases , the criminals buy a debit card so the @entity11 can issue the refund on that card , although some thieves have also gotten their returns on actual @entity53 checks			1
the thieves know that the @entity11 does not verify the employer w - 2s sent with the return until after the refund is issued			1
it is a particular problem in the state of @entity1 , according to law enforcement officials			2
" we ca n't go ... two days in a row without making a traffic stop , and there 's going to be tax return fraud in the car , " @entity24 said			1
" we could stop an 18 - year - old kid who 's got five ( debit ) cards			0
the average is $ 5,000 per card			2
so they 'll have $ 25,000 , which is really cash , even though it 's on debit cards			2
" and it 's not just small - time criminals , he said			0
" we have other cases that range up to $ 100 million where subjects have opened up corporations and bank accounts and business accounts , " @entity24 said			2
" and they 're receiving millions of dollars from the @entity11 that are all fraudulent			1
" prisoners ' tax refund scam nets millions from @entity11 last year , @entity0 police arrested the leader of the " @entity92 " gang that they say specializes in tax return fraud			1
when police searched his home , they found about $ 250,000 in debit cards " just sitting on the dining room table for that week 's worth of work , " @entity24 said			2
" and inside his closet , there were nine to 10 spiral notebooks , ledgers of names , @entity33 numbers , and dates of birth and the dollar amounts of returns that they 've done on 3,000 victims , " he added			0
it 's a crime that has replaced drug dealing in many neighborhoods			0
" they 're sitting on a computer or @entity118 ; they 're doing a return with a stolen identity where they do n't have to rob anybody or stick a gun in anybody 's face or run through the streets from police , " @entity24 said			1
although tax refund fraud has been around for decades , @entity0 's interim police chief @entity129 said the speedy returns and the option of having your refund issued on a debit card are making it easier for criminals to pull off the fraud			1
" i think ( the @entity11 's ) intentions might have been good in trying to speed returns to members of the community , but i think the problem is , they have set up a system that is too easy to abuse , " @entity129 said			2
he suggested that the @entity11 slow its processing of tax returns			2
" right now , when someone becomes a victim of income tax fraud and they catch it , it could take up to a year for them to get their return , " @entity129 said			2
" but the way that the @entity11 is running the system right now , somebody can make a fraudulent return , ( and ) they are mailing out a check to them in two weeks without checking the information on the return			1
" in @entity1 , where identity theft is rampant , the cities of @entity0 and @entity165 have been particularly hard hit by the fraud			1
police estimate that in the past two years , criminals in @entity165 have cashed in on $ 450 million in fraudulent tax return money			1
even police who are fully aware of the scam have become targets themselves , including four @entity178 detectives who specialize in combating tax refund fraud and officers in other @entity1 police departments			2
police in @entity165 discovered " a written tutorial that tells you step by step how to commit this type of crime , " according to the city 's police chief , @entity183			2
" throughout those written pages , it says how simple it is to do it , " she said			0
" we 've also heard from people on the street that it 's about a five - minute street - corner lesson			0
" in fact , a police informant who teaches friends how to commit the fraud said anyone could learn it			0
" it 's like friends get together , and everybody brings their laptops , and we all work together , " the informant said			0
" some people i know get up at like 8 in the morning and do n't finish until 8 at night			0
" law enforcement officials said that if the @entity11 stopped allowing the use of debit cards , that would curtail a majority of the fraud			2
" the debit cards are a huge problem , " @entity218 said			0
" plus ... the ( @entity11 's ) focus , from my understanding , is getting these tax returns out quickly ... so instead of focusing on getting those out quickly , ( the @entity11 should ) put more of a focus on the fraudulent aspect of it			1
" deputy irs commissioner @entity228 pointed out that the debit cards are widely used by legitimate taxpayers who may not have a bank account			0
" one hundred and forty million folks are filing their returns every year			0
not every taxpayer has a bank account , and so the debit cards that are issued by a third - party provider are a legitimate way for taxpayers to get their refund , " she said			0
last year , the @entity11 reported 938,664 fraudulent returns related to identity theft , totaling $ 6.5 billion , treasury inspector general for tax administration j. @entity245 told a @entity248 subcommittee this month			1
treasury officials say that was money identified by the @entity11 as fraudulent but not actually issued			1
the @entity11 could not provide an estimate of how much fraudulent refund money it has issued			1
" any dollar that goes out of our tax system related to refund fraud is a dollar too much , " @entity254 said			0
" we have noticed that there are more folks attempting identity theft			1
we 're in the middle of filing season , and we should be able to have a better assessment of exactly what the dollar amount could potentially be			0
" last year , the @entity11 identified at least 582,000 taxpayers who were the victims of identity theft , which is more than double the amount from only three years prior			1
in testimony before @entity271 last year , national taxpayer advocate @entity269 said the @entity11 has implemented a number of filters to catch the fraud , including an electronic marker to mark accounts of verified identity theft victims , an @entity11 identity theft affidavit form and a standardized list of acceptable documents to substantiate identity theft			1
@entity254 said the @entity11 filters are " in place from the start of the filing season " and are " part of our prevention and detection			2
" she also said the @entity11 has trained 40,000 employees across the country in the past three months to deal with identity theft			1
also , the @entity11 last year began issuing an @entity291 to victims of identity theft when filing their future returns			1
but the filters , according to @entity269 's annual report to @entity271 , " inevitably block large numbers of proper refund claims " since there " is no easy way to distinguish proper claims from improper ones			0
" tax refund fraud by identity theft will be the subject of tuesday 's hearing before the @entity305			1
it is the third hearing on the issue since last year			0
@entity165 officials have expressed concern that the @entity11 is not doing enough to combat the situation , which @entity218 said is one of the worst cases of fraud she has seen in her career			1
" in my 28 years of law enforcement , i do n't think that i have ever seen this magnitude of fraud that is just wide open , " the police chief said			0
" it 's wide open and there just does n't seem to be much being done about it			0
" @entity165 mayor @entity322 said he 's angry that the @entity11 has not done more to help the city combat the fraud			1
" as far as i 'm concerned , they 're missing in action , " @entity322 said			0
" they have not been helpful ; they have not been a player ; they have not taken responsibility for their side of the enforcement			0
if anything , you know , we 've been banging our heads against their door asking for help and getting nothing in response			0
the silence has been deafening			0
" @entity254 disagreed with the mayor , noting that the @entity11 has " significantly increased the amount of resources we 've devoted to identity theft , a heinous crime			1
" a week after @entity2 's march 6 interview with @entity254 , the @entity11 sent a team of officials to meet with police officials in @entity0 and @entity165			1
@entity322 said the problem in @entity165 is " just the tip of the iceberg " and offered this warning to the mayors of other @entity360 cities : " go back and ask the @entity11 in ( your ) jurisdiction , ' what are you doing ? is this a problem in my jurisdiction ? ' because i guarantee you it is , " @entity322 said			1
" you may not know it , but it is			0
