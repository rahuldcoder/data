" @entity7 " @entity7 has been on trial for a week , charged with the murder of his girlfriend , model @entity5			1
at this point , some facts are beyond dispute			2
the @entity13 and @entity14 track star killed his girlfriend in the early hours of @entity16 last year			0
he fired four bullets through the door of a toilet room she was in			0
three hit her ; the final one in the head , and she died			0
the overarching question in the trial is why he did it			2
he says he thought she was a burglar and made a tragic mistake			1
prosecutors say the couple argued and he shot her in anger			1
in the first week of the trial , it became clear that the judge 's verdict would hinge on several questions that , so far , remain unanswered : what were the bangs that neighbors heard on the night of the shooting ? four people who live near @entity7 said they heard loud bangs on the night of the shooting , with a pause between them			1
all four -- @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 -- said they thought at the time that the sounds were gunshots			2
they generally agree that there was a pause between two distinct sets of bangs or booms , with screaming in between			2
defense lawyer @entity60 argues that the second set of bangs was in fact the sound of @entity7 breaking down the toilet door with a cricket bat after he realized what he had done			1
but @entity68 and @entity50 said the three bangs they heard came in such quick succession that there would have been no time to swing the cricket bat back before striking the door again			0
does @entity7 sound like a woman when he screams ? there were some chuckles in court when @entity60 first asserted that @entity7 sounds like a woman when he screams , but it turns out to be a critical part of the defense			1
some witnesses testified to hearing screams before any of the bangs , including the sound of both a man and a woman shouting			1
the prosecution argues that the screaming was the argument that led @entity7 to murder @entity5			1
but there was a second scream or series of screams that the neighbors said sounded like a woman in terror			0
@entity68 called them " petrifying , " and @entity50 said the woman sounded " scared , almost scared out of her mind			0
" that screaming , the prosecution suggests , was @entity5 fleeing in fear from an enraged @entity7			1
but the defense says it was @entity7 himself , screaming in anguish as he realized his deadly error			1
@entity110 gave some support to this theory , saying she heard what she thought was a woman screaming and asked her husband what it was			0
her husband , who knows the track star , told her it was @entity7 , she testified			1
but @entity120 , an ex-girlfriend of @entity7 , testified that he had yelled at her and others often and that when he shouted , he sounded like a man			2
is @entity7 trigger happy ? this is a key element of the state 's case , which prosecutor @entity127 admitted in his opening statement is " circumstantial " -- there were no eyewitnesses to the killing			1
so the state has brought two unrelated gun charges against @entity7 -- one that a gun went off in a crowded restaurant when he was holding it , and one that he fired a gun out a car 's sunroof in irritation after an aggravating police stop for speeding that turned into an argument over his gun			1
it 's not clear that the prosecution witnesses who have talked about the two incidents have done much to build the state 's case			0
boxer @entity149 , a friend of @entity7 , was with him at the restaurant , he testified			2
@entity149 said a third friend , @entity150 , passed @entity7 a loaded gun under the table , telling the athlete he was " one up			2
" that meant there was a bullet in the chamber of the gun , ready to fire			0
almost immediately , it went off under the table			0
@entity7 apologized to his friends and asked @entity163 to take the blame , which he did in order to avoid drawing attention to the @entity7			2
@entity120 is the only source for the sunroof incident thus far , and she was unable to provide any details about where it took place			0
@entity60 said that @entity7 was in fact golfing at @entity174 in @entity175 the day after @entity120 said it happened			2
but @entity120 also said that @entity7 carried a gun with him and that at least once when he heard a noise at his bedroom window at night , he woke her , took his gun and went to investigate			1
another time when he thought his car was being followed , she said , he took his gun and knocked on the window of the other car with it			0
did @entity7 lie to a security guard after killing @entity5 ? the ninth and last witness of the week was @entity189 , who was on duty as the security shift supervisor at the @entity192 on the night @entity7 shot @entity5			1
several neighbors called his office to report hearing gunshots , and @entity189 went out with another guard to investigate			0
he ended up near the @entity7 house , speaking to @entity7 on the phone			2
according to @entity189 , @entity7 said : " security , everything is fine			1
" but @entity189 could hear @entity7 crying and decided to go to the house			2
he arrived in time to see @entity7 carrying @entity5 's body down the stairs			1
" my lady , i was so shocked i could n't think for a few moments , " he told the judge			0
@entity60 made a concerted effort to shake @entity189 's version of what @entity7 said on the phone , asking twice in a row whether the runner had said " everything " was fine or that " he " was fine , then whether he had said " ok " or " fine			1
" @entity189 stuck to his story and finally turned to the judge to say : " my lady , mr. @entity7 's exact words were , ' security , everything is fine			1
' " testimony for the week ended on that note , with @entity189 to continue on the stand monday			0
why do @entity221 call security rather than the police when they hear gunshots ? @entity221 who can afford it tend to live in areas with private security			0
their alarm systems alert their private security guards , not police			0
@entity221 who use private security say their guards are based closer and will be on the scene faster than police			0
of the four @entity7 neighbors who testified , only one , @entity50 , said he called police -- and even he called private security first			1
he said that the estate 's security guards arrived soon after he called , and that after talking to them , he went to the house to see if he , a doctor , could help			0
he found security guards there and told them to call an ambulance			0
he left after the ambulance team did , by which time police still had not arrived .			0

@entity7 says he thought @entity5 was a burglar and made a tragic mistake
prosecutors say the couple argued and he shot her in anger
the *nature* of bangs and screams on the night of the shooting are in dispute
