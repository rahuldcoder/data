-- @entity2 's new goalscoring machine @entity3 grabbed a late winner as the holders reached the quarterfinals of the @entity7 with a 3 - 2 win over @entity9			1
@entity10 international @entity3 , nicknamed ' little pea ' strode on to a @entity12 pass before beating visiting goalkeeper @entity13 for his last minute clincher at @entity15			0
@entity3 had been introduced as a late substitute for @entity17 , but not before the young @entity19 find had put @entity2 ahead early in the second half			1
it was @entity17 's first goal since his surprise summer signing for @entity2 from @entity24			2
he showed enough in a tepid first half and with his goal , admittedly after a deflection , to suggest that manager @entity29 's gamble on a player he admitted he had not seen play , could pay off			0
but @entity9 threatened an upset with @entity33 muscling his way through to level from a corner , while the returning @entity37 saw his shot clip the top of the crossbar as @entity2 wobbled			0
then @entity41 , having wasted an earlier cast - iron chance , put @entity2 ahead again with a clever shot from inside the area			0
but @entity9 leveled again through @entity45 and looked set to force injury time until @entity3 , who scored twice in the 2 - 1 win at @entity48 in the @entity49 on saturday , popped up again			1
" when he comes on , you just know that if he gets a chance he is going to take it , " @entity29 told @entity52			0
in other @entity7 action , @entity49 @entity54 beat @entity56 2 - 0 and @entity57 saw off the challenge of third - flight @entity59 in a penalty shoot out			2
high - flying @entity62 continued their fine form with a 4 - 1 win at @entity66 's @entity65 .			1

@entity3 scores the winner as @entity2 beat @entity9 in @entity7
@entity2 's @entity17 scored his first goal for the club in the 3 - 2 win at @entity15
@entity62 beat @entity66 's @entity65 to reach last eight
