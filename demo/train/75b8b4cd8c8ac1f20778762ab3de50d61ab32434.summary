-- college costs too much , both for students and for society as a whole			1
this year , according to the @entity5 , average published in - state tuition and fee plus room / board charges exceed $ 17,000 at four - year public institutions , a 6 % increase from only one year earlier			0
in 2009 , spending by @entity14 for post-secondary education totaled $ 461 billion , an amount 42 % greater than in 2000 , after accounting for inflation			1
this $ 461 billion is the equivalent of 3.3 % of total @entity14 gross domestic product ( gdp ) and an amount greater than the total gdp of countries such as @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
the public is taking notice			0
the @entity29 protesters have featured student debt forgiveness as one of their demands , and students in @entity34 have demonstrated several times in the past year after their tuition was raised twice			2
earlier this week , @entity14 secretary of education @entity37 addressed some of these concerns in a speech where he urged colleges to get serious about their cost problem			1
but there 's only so much the federal government can ( and should ) do			2
the underlying structure of @entity14 higher education needs dramatic reform before there will be any relief in sight			1
whereas private businesses cut prices for consumers and costs to themselves through efficiencies that increase profits and incomes , universities lack those incentives			1
indeed , the typical successful university president views his or her key constituencies not to be the customer ( students and their parents who pay tuition charges or the granters of research funds ) , but rather others -- the faculty , important alumni , key administrators , trustees and occasionally politicians			1
they please these constituencies by raising , and then spending , lots of money			0
they effectively bribe powerful faculty with low teaching loads , high salaries and good parking			0
they give the alumni successful intercollegiate athletic programs that are expensive and usually financed off the backs of students			0
they give trustees whatever they want , no matter how costly or eccentric			0
universities do a second thing unheard of in the private sector -- they often deliberately turn customers away			1
a fast food chain or discount store succeeds by selling more hamburgers or television sets ; no customer was ever kept from spending money at @entity103 by an " admissions office			0
" yet for @entity14 universities , the " bottom line " is measured by college rankings that often reward schools for turning people away , becoming more " selective			1
" many believe the @entity111 offers the best education in the world , so why do we encourage those elite institutions to deny access to thousands of highly qualified students every year ? like health care , prices are rising rapidly for higher education because of the predominant role of third - party payments -- federal student loans and grants , state government support for institutions and students , private philanthropic gifts and endowment income			1
college seniors who borrow to finance their education now graduate with an average of $ 24,000 in debt , and student loan debt now tops credit card debt among @entity14			1
when some else is paying a lot of the bills , students are less sensitive to the price , thus allowing the colleges to care less about keeping prices under control			1
and the nonprofit nature of institutions reduces incentives for colleges and universities to be efficient			1
the key to getting costs under control is contained in three words that begin with the letter " i " -- information , incentives and innovation			1
customers are ignorant of college outcomes because we do not measure in any coherent and consistent manner what students actually learn , how well they do after graduation or whether they think better in a critical manner as a result of the college experience			1
even basic financial information on how colleges spend money is often not fully shared with trustees or key politicians who help fund or oversee college operations			2
as mentioned above , incentives to conserve resources are few			0
once , as a department chairman , i successfully battled for more faculty members to do the same amount of work , thus lowering productivity			0
the result ? my faculty evaluated me highly so i got a nice raise			0
where else do the employees get to decide who their bosses will be or how much they will be paid ? if information and incentives are provided , innovation will come			2
already , we know several online and other innovations can work to deliver high - quality education services at potentially lower prices			0
@entity37 highlighted @entity196 , a nonprofit online institution , as one such example			0
@entity199 forms of education need more emphasis , since the number of college graduates exceeds the number of jobs available in occupations for which degrees historically have been desirable -- jobs in the managerial , technical and professional areas			2
according to data from the @entity213 , in 2008 some 29.7 % of flight attendants , 24.4 % of retail salespersons and 17.4 % of baggage porters had a bachelor 's degree or higher			0
according to my analysis of the data , more than 17 million college graduates were " underemployed " in 2008			0
surely these people needed some form of post high school training , but an expensive four - year degree may not have been the best approach			0
rather , perhaps we should be encouraging some students to develop skills at lower costs by utilizing innovative free courses provided by groups such as the @entity230 and @entity231			2
college costs can not rise faster than income forever -- we can not afford it			1
necessity is the mother of invention			0
like it or not , @entity14 higher education is in for big change in the next generation			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

college costs are rising much faster than inflation
@entity244 says colleges do *n't* pay attention to real customers -- students
he says incentives need to be changed and innovation encouraged
@entity244 : @entity14 's colleges and universities will look very different in coming years
