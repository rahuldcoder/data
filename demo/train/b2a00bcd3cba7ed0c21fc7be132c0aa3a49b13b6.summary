-- as @entity4 prime minister @entity3 called on footballers to act as role models , @entity2 's @entity1 chose not to appeal his 10 - match " biting " ban handed to him by the @entity8 for biting @entity10 's @entity9			1
earlier this week the @entity12 striker was hit with the sanction by the @entity8 for biting @entity10 's @entity9 following the ruling of an @entity15			1
the ban 's severity sparked fierce criticism from the @entity2 hierarchy			1
the ban will start with immediate effect , meaning @entity1 will play no part in @entity2 's four remaining @entity23 matches with the @entity12 also ruled out for the start of next season			1
" @entity2 forward @entity1 has not appealed the suspension issued to him by an @entity15 this week , " read an @entity8 statement released on friday			2
" the @entity8 intends to publicize the @entity15 's written reasons in due course			0
" @entity1 issued a statement of contrition via his personal website where he once again apologized for his actions			2
" i know that all the things that are happening to me in @entity39 will help me to improve my conduct on the field , " said the 26 - year - old , who could still yet win the @entity36 award , after an outstanding season for @entity2			2
" whilst 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where player have actually been seriously injured , i acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch so i do not want to give the wrong impression to people by making an appeal			0
" i really want to learn from what has happened in the last two - and - a - half years , many things have been said and written about me , i just tried to do my best on the field			0
" in the aftermath of sunday 's game @entity2 condemned @entity1 's actions and fined the player , but the club expressed " shock and disappointment " at the punishment meted out to their 23 - goal top scorer			1
" the charges against @entity1 were his to consider and we have to respect his decision to not appeal the 10 - game ban , " @entity2 managing director @entity64 said in a statement released by the club			1
" @entity1 is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard			0
" we are committed to helping him improve his conduct and he will be given our full support			0
we look forward to him returning to the team next season when he is available for selection			0
" @entity2 manager @entity79 echoed @entity64 's sentiments and praised the form @entity1 has shown this season			1
" @entity1 has made a huge contribution to the squad this season and we respect his decision to accept the ban , " said the @entity84 coach			2
" he will be missed for the remainder of this season and the early part of next , but we will have the opportunity to welcome a better person and player when he returns			0
" @entity79 had earlier sprang to @entity1 's defense , suggesting the player had been unfairly targeted and that he would understand if he felt he needed to leave @entity39 football			2
" this is a guy who i see on a daily basis trying very hard			0
his two passions in life are his family and @entity2 , " the @entity84 coach told a press conference ahead of saturday 's match against @entity103			2
" he loves this country and being here			0
if i 'm @entity1 sitting at home with my wife and family , who absolutely love it here -- they love life in @entity2 and learning the language -- it 's arguable he will never have a better season than he has had this			1
" yet he has still come under this scrutiny and criticism			0
" that will make you think , no question			0
but in a couple of days ' time when he is more reflective , because there is a shock and anger at the moment , a sense of reality will set in			0
" for a second time this week , @entity3 weighed in on the debate over @entity1 's bite on friday			1
" as a dad and as a human being , do i think we should have tough penalties when football players behave like this ? yes , " the @entity4 prime minister told @entity143			1
this is not the first time the @entity12 striker has been sanctioned for a bite			0
@entity1 was handed a seven - match ban by @entity150 football authorities in 2010 for biting @entity152 's @entity151 while playing for @entity153			1
last season he was hit with an eight - match ban for racially abusing @entity156 's @entity155 .			1
