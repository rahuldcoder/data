the number of @entity2 " patriot " extremist groups has reached a record level , according to a new study , and experts are warning of a wave of anti-government violence			1
a report released tuesday by the @entity10 counted 1,360 " patriot " extremist groups in 2012 -- up by 7 % from 2011			1
the study defines patriot groups as anti-government militias driven by their fear that authorities will strip them of their guns and liberties			1
" they believe the @entity22 is being raped			0
with hate groups , things are going to get worse because they feel like they 're in battle , " said @entity23 a former @entity25 informant who spent time undercover with various militia and extremist groups			1
" it 's not surprising with their hatred of president ( @entity36 ) @entity35 that there are even more hate groups out there			2
" the study said @entity41 has the most patriot extremist groups , with 81			1

a few weeks later , a group of @entity72 men was linked to an anti-government militia plot to assassinate @entity35			1
@entity35 's election as the first @entity76 - @entity2 president and his pro-gun control stance have fueled the increase in anti-government groups , according to the report			1
" we are seeing a huge reaction to the potential for gun control , and that reaction is so angry that it 's hard not to be afraid of what 's coming down the road , " said @entity81 of the @entity10			1
domestic terror : are we doing enough ? the rise in such groups echoes a period almost 20 years ago , around the time when @entity93 passed the 1993 @entity94 and the 1994 ban on assault weapons , the @entity10 said			1
that legislation came near a period of infamous and deadly anti-government violence in @entity103 , @entity104 ; @entity108 , @entity109 ; and @entity110 , " and led to the first wave of the patriot movement , " the report said			1
extremists , @entity23 warned , " are in a battle in their minds			1
their backs are against the wall			0

" it 's dubious to assume growth in numbers is related to violence			0
" also , the center 's definition of hate groups has changed in the past year , kicking up a controversy			1
critics accused the group of unfairly bundling together organizations with vastly different points of view -- and painting them all as potentially violent			2
for example a @entity141 - based group calling itself " @entity142 " appears on the @entity10 list of active " patriots			1
" but founder @entity146 says her organization is harmless			1

" who would be in sympathy with them ? " @entity146 said she and her group just want @entity161 to leave them alone			0
when @entity142 showed up on the @entity10 list , @entity146 said she was n't surprised			2
but it made her wonder , " is this all they have to do ? " nonetheless , @entity146 's thankful to be on the list because she said it increases her group 's notoriety			0
fringe elements @entity23 said most of the fringe elements characterized in the report hate the government more than they do specific races			2
they hate everyone , @entity23 said			2
now a private investigator , @entity23 spent years undercover as an @entity25 informant watching the internal workings of white supremacist groups			1
the groups named in the @entity10 study came from information compiled from " field reports , @entity187 publications , the @entity188 , law enforcement sources and news reports			1
