-- president @entity2 's poignant speech at sunday 's interfaith vigil in @entity4 , @entity5 , set the tone for our mourning			1
now , @entity10 's path forward will be decided out of the spotlight			0
the question of whether the tragedy at @entity14 will linger only in memory or be memorialized by an enduring shift in gun policy can only be answered by the legislature			0
incoming @entity20 chair sen. @entity19 has announced she will introduce an enhanced assault weapons ban on the first day of the new @entity22 , but the fate of that legislation is in the hands of vice president @entity26			1
@entity26 will reportedly lead the administration 's political response			1
no politician could be better suited to the challenge of passing federal gun control legislation than @entity26			1
over the past four decades , @entity26 has been one of the most consistent and effective advocates of gun control and violence prevention legislation			1
in 1994 , @entity26 shepherded the @entity35 through the @entity36 , a near miracle six years in the making			1
after @entity26 wrote the @entity35 in 1988 , @entity39 quickly filibustered , blocking the bill for four years			2
he steered " the @entity26 crime bill " through the lengthy filibuster by negotiating with @entity39 and making revisions			2
" every single line in that bill was written with every single major @entity49 a part of it , " @entity26 said in a september 12 , 1994 , interview on the @entity46 show			1
the @entity52 administration and then - sen. @entity26 repeatedly refused to make concessions that would have jeopardized the substance of the act , even after debate over the amendment we know as the federal assault weapons ban imperiled the entire bill			1
instead of backing down , @entity26 took on @entity49 sens. @entity61 and @entity62 and faced opponents attacking the bill as taxpayer - funded " dance lessons and midnight basketball for robbers and rapists			2
" @entity69 : where fear and taboo control guns more than laws @entity26 did not budge : " make no mistake , this is about guns , guns , guns			1
" the crime bill passed the @entity36 in november 1993			2
when the bill foundered in the @entity81 , @entity26 persevered			2
it reached president @entity52 's desk thanks to an unexpected , eleventh - hour push from a " @entity85 of @entity39 " led by rep. @entity86 of @entity87			2
he 'd been swayed during a series of meetings with the @entity91 and other @entity39 , at which @entity26 was the only senator in attendance			2
the resulting legislation banned the manufacture of 19 types of semi-automatic firearms and criminalized the possession of high - capacity magazines			1
the process taught a critical lesson : when otherwise " pro-gun ' " lawmakers have to choose between a crime bill including a gun ban and inaction , it is more than possible for them to vote to protect @entity10			0
unfortunately , the assault weapons ban expired in 2004			0
since then , numerous lawmakers , including @entity26 , have tried and failed to get the ban renewed			2
@entity22 now has a rare opportunity to take new action on gun control			1
after @entity4 , proponents of stricter gun legislation are backed by public opinion and bolstered by a surge of political support			2
the " pro-gun " wing of the @entity49 and the @entity119 remain silent even as their supporters are defecting publicly			0
@entity123 sens. @entity122 and @entity124 , whose voting record earned them the @entity119 's " top rating , " have backed off their " pro-gun " positions and declared that " everything must be on the table " for legislative debate			0
the 31 pro-gun senators have not spoken since friday 's tragedy , signaling the possibility that some of them might be changing their minds on guns , too			0
lawmakers are essentially being asked to consider an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban			0
on sunday , @entity19 promised the legislation " will ban the sale , the transfer , the importation and the possession " of assault weapons and ban high - capacity magazines as well as " clips of more than ten bullets			1
" @entity26 will likely support a new ban on assault weapons and push for improvements			0
his 2007 @entity154 and @entity155 would not only have renewed the ban but required background checks for all gun purchases , closing the " gun show loophole			0
' " @entity26 has also called on @entity22 to address the relationship of mental illness to violence in the wake of the @entity164 shootings			0
was your gun banned ? the president cautioned @entity10 sunday , saying " no single law , no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world , or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society			0
but that ca n't be an excuse for inaction			0
surely , we can do better than this			0
" in his first term , however , @entity2 practiced a policy of appeasement , failing to block the expansion of gun rights or promote gun control			1
to ensure @entity22 passes tough , comprehensive gun control laws rather than settling for a watered - down version , as with health care , @entity2 must let @entity26 lead			1
why ? @entity26 has distinguished himself as an adroit and effective statesman in both the legislative and the executive branches			1
the former six - term senator has a deft touch with moderate and conservative counterparts : in 2008 , he eulogized @entity197			0
as vice president , he has spearheaded the implementation of the @entity200			0
moreover , @entity26 has a particular passion for protecting students and educators			0
his wife , @entity204 , has been teaching for more than 30 years			0
the deaths of 20 first - graders and six adults compel all @entity10 as sons and daughters , fathers and mothers , uncles and aunts , to consult their moral compasses			0
legislators face a greater responsibility : a moral imperative to pass any legislation that could possibly prevent a future @entity4 , @entity218 , @entity219 or @entity220			0
opinion : gun violence is a national security issue as @entity2 ministers to the @entity10 people and offers words of comfort , @entity26 must move lawmakers to action			1
in 1994 , @entity26 warned his colleagues , " we simply ca n't let the gun lobby deny to the @entity10 people the vital benefits in this bill			1
" @entity26 must once more appeal to @entity22 to enact gun control			1
if anyone can succeed in those chambers , it 's @entity26			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 - @entity241			1

@entity242 - @entity241 : @entity2 has apparently tapped @entity26 as gun control point man
she says he was leader in @entity36 on issue , shepherding 1994 gun control legislation
it banned manufacture of many semi-automatic guns , criminalized high - capacity magazines
writer : @entity26 worked across aisle ; he 's adroit , determined statesman , right man for job
