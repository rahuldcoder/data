@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in @entity5 as named by the @entity6			1
she runs global health and care organization @entity7 and under her leadership it has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries and record revenues			1
@entity2 's @entity13 spoke to her in @entity1 and began by asking her why there are so few women at the top			1
she said it goes beyond family issues			2
@entity3 : women sometimes do n't put themselves forward for things			1
and one of the things i think about and talk about a lot is that women often lack confidence to go for the next job , the top job			2
they sometimes do n't wish to compete or they do n't think they 're good enough for the next thing			0
@entity13 : why do you think that is ? @entity3 : partly a lack of role models , partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family , in work			1
but also i think there is still -- i do n't like to call it a glass ceiling , but i think there is still an unseen barrier for women , which is that , if you ask most business people , would they like to promote more women , they would all say yes , they 'd love to : " where are these women , i want to promote them , " will be the answer			0
but often they do n't really automatically think of a woman first for a top job			2
@entity13 : and what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top ? @entity3 : well , first of all , to learn as much as you can and to make sure you 've got the right experience , the right qualifications , and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction			1
but i think another piece of advice i would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want , because i think one thing that happens with women , which perhaps is a gender difference , is that women often hang back and think " i will be noticed for my results , everybody will see how great i am because i 've delivered these exceptional outcomes "			0
but actually life is n't like that , you have to tell people about your results and your achievements , and men are often better at doing that than women are			0
@entity13 : what do you think separates good leadership from great leadership ? @entity3 : well , i think good leaders should be judged on their results			1
and i think of a good leader you should be able to say " she transformed the business , " " she upped the performance , " " she exceeded the expectations of the stakeholders			0
" i think of a great leader i would go to that old @entity110 saying , " of a great leader the people will say " we did it ourselves " "			0
@entity13 : do you think that women in general as managers are more inclusive than men ? @entity3 : no , i do n't			1
in fact , i sometimes find these gender differences , when sort of represented in the business environment , are actually just not very useful			0
i think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and i do n't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide			0
because i have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial , and i 've equally seen men who are very consultative			0
so , i do n't just think it divides that way			0
@entity13 : you clearly love what you do			2
what is it about business that you think is such a buzz ? @entity3 : it 's the constant challenge , there 's always something new , there 's a new competitor , there 's a new pressure , there 's a new opportunity , there 's a new challenge , i think that 's what keeps us all going			1
i think it 's the thrill of the chase , basically			2
