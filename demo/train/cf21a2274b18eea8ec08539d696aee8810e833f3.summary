@entity0 -- moments after the @entity6 @entity5 ruled on a pair of same - sex marriage cases , the handful of @entity3 considering running for president in 2016 stumbled over themselves in a rush of celebratory reaction , blasting out a salvo of congratulatory press releases and tweets			1
rulings hailed as historic victory voting 5 - 4 in each of two decisions , the justices struck down part of the @entity19 that denied federal benefits to same - sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in @entity25			1
former secretary of state @entity26 , whose husband signed @entity19 into law in 1996 , applauded the decision			0
" by overturning the @entity19 , the court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union , " @entity30 said in a joint statement with her husband , @entity30			0
@entity40 gov. @entity39 called the rulings " a powerful step forward			0
" @entity44 gov. @entity43 said the opinions were " groundbreaking			0
" @entity47 directs @entity48 to implement marriage ruling their responses make political sense			2
public opinion on same - sex marriage has shifted dramatically from the time president @entity30 signed the bill into law almost 17 years ago , after the legislation was approved by overwhelming majorities in both the @entity60 - controlled @entity59 and @entity61			1
in 1996 , just 27 % of @entity6 said gay and lesbian marriages should be recognized by law , according to @entity1 polling			0
by 2007 , the number had jumped to 40 %			0
today , a majority of @entity6 -- 55 % -- say that marriages between gays and lesbians should be recognized as valid , with 44 % opposed			0
more than two - thirds of young people support same - sex marriage , a recent @entity71 survey found			1
poll : majority backs same - sex marriage @entity3 who support same - sex marriage are now playing on increasingly friendly political turf , a circumstance that prompted a raft of @entity84 senators to reverse their positions on the issue earlier this year in quick succession			1
by the numbers : same - sex marriage " the battle lines are now clearly drawn for future elections , " said @entity90 , a @entity84 consultant who advises @entity39			1
" democrats , like the majority of @entity6 , support freedom and equality			0
@entity60 embrace the stale and exclusionary policies of the past			2
like immigration and women 's health in 2012 , this is an issue that will haunt the @entity60 for years to come			2
" meanwhile , the court 's rulings wednesday were met with something less than unbridled enthusiasm by the @entity60 political class			2
" my interest in weighing in on this topic approaches zero , " said one veteran @entity60 working on a 2014 @entity61 race when asked to opine on the cases			2
the reason is clear enough : @entity60 tacticians understand that winning modern races often means surviving the obstacle course of a conservative - dominated primary before having to appeal to general election voters who , nationally , view same - sex marriage as a non-issue			1
@entity60 leaders in @entity0 expressed dismay at the ruling , but seemed eager to wash their hands of a polarizing national issue that , thanks to the court 's opinion on @entity130 , will now be considered in state capitals instead of the corridors of @entity133			1
" a robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square , and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman , " said @entity59 speaker @entity134 in a prepared statement			0
opinion : @entity5 got it wrong on gay marriage the political fight over marriage is felt most acutely , perhaps , in @entity149 , where three state @entity5 judges were removed from the bench in 2010 in a recall election after they ruled in favor of same - sex marriage in the state			1
defending traditional marriage -- between one man and one woman -- has become an animating issue for @entity149 's vibrant social conservative community since that initial ruling in 2009 , and a litmus test for @entity60 candidates seeking their approval , either in contested primaries or in the state 's presidential caucuses			1
at the beginning of last year 's @entity60 presidential primary fight , @entity167 narrowly won the @entity149 caucuses with the backing of a dedicated network of pastors and home - school families who rallied to his side because of his furious opposition to abortion rights and same - sex marriage			1
but other @entity60 in @entity149 say the party is consigning itself to minority status by failing to embrace the shifting opinions about marriage that wednesday 's court ruling seemed to ratify			1
what happens next ? " we ca n't afford to create a litmus test for the party , " said @entity185 , who steered @entity187 's presidential campaign in @entity149 and said he was pleased with the ruling			2
" there are too many young people , and too many people who frankly care far more about other issues , and people in the liberty movement who simply have no problem with same sex - marriage			2
we have to maintain a kind of open - armed stance on this			0
" but @entity149 @entity60 seeking their party 's @entity61 nomination in 2014 are n't quite jumping on @entity185 's bandwagon			1
none of them cheered wednesday 's decisions			0
the one @entity61 candidate who did celebrate was @entity209 -- the likely @entity84 nominee			0
@entity210 , a suspender - wearing college professor and former talk radio host running for the @entity149 seat , blasted the @entity19 ruling and said it opens the door to " polyamorous " marriages between more than two people			1
while @entity210 acknowledged that being a modern - day opponent of same - sex marriage presents a political challenge for himself and other @entity60 , he said conservatives are fed up with being attacked by the left for simply stating their principles on the matter			1
" every time you advance the notion that you are a conservative and that you believe in traditional marriage , you get hammered , " @entity210 said			0
" people who have strong beliefs have been silenced			0
you ca n't talk about it except among your own friends			0
" opinion : for gays , progress stunning , fast for @entity60 , the same - sex marriage rulings were something of a @entity239 test , exposing the almost timeless fault line between the party 's pragmatists and its ideologues			1
for figures in the party 's establishment like @entity185 , the rulings were met with a sinking feeling that same - sex marriage is increasingly a settled matter for voters and a potent wedge issue that @entity3 can exploit for political gain in battleground states and in national elections			1
statements from the establishment wing of the party wednesday were either risk - averse or nonexistent			0
@entity260 chairman @entity259 issued no comment on the ruling			0
senate minority leader @entity263 dodged a question about it			0
@entity267 rep. @entity266 said he opposes same - sex marriage but called for " respect , " " civility " and " understanding " as people work through their " honest disagreements			1
" most of the @entity60 considering presidential bids in 2016 proceeded with caution , aware that their statements will likely be revisited if they ever become the party 's standard - bearer in a general election			2
potential 2016 contenders take a stand on @entity5 rulings @entity285 sen. @entity284 issued a nearly 500 - word commentary explaining his opposition to same - sex marriage			1
but for outspoken conservatives who tend to get rewarded in @entity60 primaries , the opinions were greeted with fury -- general election consequences be damned			2
@entity167 , who is expected to make another play for the @entity59 in 2016 , attacked the " activist judges " on the court			0
@entity298 sen. @entity297 , a freshman senator who harbors obvious national ambitions , called the rulings " a regrettable overreach against the will of the people			0
" these harsh denouncements had the added benefit of stoking outrage among family values conservatives around the country who contribute financially to their causes			0
the mood was similar among @entity60 candidates further down the ballot , who are running in gerrymandered @entity59 districts where winning a @entity60 primary is the only victory that matters -- providing little political incentive to side with gays and lesbians			2
take this year 's special election in @entity323 's ruby red @entity321 , where former state sen. @entity324 , a front - runner for the seat , wasted little time in hammering the court			0
" i am disappointed in today 's decision , but know that @entity329 stand strong in supporting our states ' right to define marriage without intrusion from the federal government , " @entity324 said			0
in @entity324 's hometown of @entity338 , as in the rest of the @entity340 , there is less appetite for same - sex marriage than in other parts of the country			1
in the @entity345 , 63 % of @entity6 favor legal rights for same - sex couples , according to a recent @entity1 poll			1
in the @entity349 , 58 % of @entity6 say the same			0
but in the @entity353 , the number of people who approve of same - sex marriage is 51 % , and in the @entity340 , it 's 49 %			1
those also happen to be regions where @entity61 @entity3 find themselves in potentially difficult re-election fights -- suggesting that while opinions about marriage may buoy @entity3 nationally and in swing states , the issue is more perilous for the party in places such as @entity363 , @entity364 and @entity365 , where incumbent @entity3 will be on the ballot next year			2
