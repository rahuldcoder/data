-- the holder of one of three winning tickets in a record $ 656 million @entity4 drawing has come forward to claim a share , @entity2 officials said monday			1
they scheduled a news conference for tuesday morning , at which " no winners will be present , " said @entity11 , a spokeswoman for the @entity2			1
when asked whether there was more than one winner , she responded : " perhaps			2
" no other details were immediately available			0
@entity2 was one of three states where three tickets matched the winning numbers -- 2 , 4 , 23 , 38 and 46 , with a @entity20 of 23 -- amounting to an equal share of roughly $ 218.6 million , before taxes , under the annuity option			1
the other winning tickets were purchased in @entity25 and @entity26			1
the @entity25 winner , who was the first to officially come forward last week , chose to remain anonymous -- as will the holder of the ticket sold in @entity30 , said @entity31			1
last week , @entity2 officials were responding to a flurry of questions from the media after a @entity36 - area woman told the @entity37 that she had one of the winning tickets			1
however , in a bizarre twist of the story , @entity40 , a 37 - year - old single mother of seven who works at @entity42 , told the @entity37 she was n't sure where she last had the ticket			0
" i 'm still looking for it			0
i have n't even looked in my uniform pants yet , " the @entity37 quoted @entity47 as saying			0
" i 'm still looking everywhere to find it , in my purse , everywhere			0
" the state 's lottery director said last thursday he had n't seen the ticket , but he also said then that no one else had come forward			2
spokeswoman @entity11 said last tuesday she did n't " put much stock in that story			1
" " she claims she won , " @entity31 said last week			2
" she ca n't produce a ticket			0
... in our opinion , until they walk in that door , hold that ticket , produce valid identification and our security people can process and validate it , it does n't matter			0
" @entity31 declined to comment monday on whether the winning ticker holder was , in fact , @entity47			2
