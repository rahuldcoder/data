" the race among women was much tighter in swing states , " said @entity144 , an associate professor of political science at @entity146 in @entity147			0
" from now on , i would expect that president @entity2 will tout his record on pay equity and support for contraception to shore up support among women			1
still , i would expect that @entity2 's performance will be stronger among single than married women			1
the question will be whether he can get single women to turn out in high rates this time around			0
