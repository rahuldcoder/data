-- across @entity2 , young girls dream of escaping their small towns for the big cities			0
they dream of a good job and a better life in the @entity7			1
that was the case of " @entity9 , " a name given to protect her identity			1
her dream of a better life quickly evolved into a nightmare			0
when she was 15 , she met a charming man at a party who would later become her boyfriend			2
" this individual would tell me a lot about the @entity7 and would ask me to join him to go work at a clothes factory , " she said			1
@entity9 was eventually smuggled into the @entity7 and taken to @entity24			1

" it was a very traumatic experience , " she said			0
" the first day i started working was very hard because i had to sleep with 20 men in rapid sequence			0
" for several months she saved up tips , just a few dollars at a time , that she would hide in a refrigerator			0
she discreetly would ask older women , who were also forced into prostitution , about directions to the nearest bus station and streets around the area			1
when she felt she had enough for a bus trip , she ran away to the bus station and bought a ticket to a city she did n't know			0
she has been a free woman for several years now , but she says she still suffers from nightmares and says her life has been scarred			0
many people associate prostitution with women walking the streets in shady areas and being picked up by johns			2
but @entity9 says the prostitution ring for which she was forced to work had a long list of clients who knew the price they had to pay , who to call and where to go			1
it 's a well - organized and lucrative underground industry			0
@entity78 monitors human trafficking at the @entity80			1
he says there are no reliable figures on the scale of the problem , but forced prostitution from @entity2 and @entity86 is a big part of it			1
" they know that their victims are not going to go to law enforcement , " said @entity78			2
" they know that their victims are afraid			2
in fact , sometimes one of their threats is to turn people over to the immigration service			0
" @entity9 was 15 when she was forced to become a prostitute , but there are younger victims , as @entity78 found out when he worked as a federal prosecutor at the @entity103			1
" i ended up seeing cases with girls as young as 13 and women in their 40s and everything in between , " he said			0

the @entity115 also estimates that at least 1.39 million of those are victims of commercial sexual servitude in their own countries or abroad			1
but the current trafficking from @entity2 and @entity86 is of special concern for @entity125			2
" we have situations in the @entity7 , cases that i 've worked on , when i was with the @entity103 involving women who had to serve as up to 50 customers a day ; just a crushing amount of what in fact is a daily set of rapes , " said @entity78			2
several cases have been successfully prosecuted in states , including @entity138 and @entity24 , against prostitution rings that operate in the same way			0
they lure women in @entity2 with promises of a good job only to be forced into sexual slavery once here			2

ten years ago , the @entity171 passed a law that allows victims of human trafficking to stay in the country if they testify in court against perpetrators of the crime			1
@entity179 , an immigration attorney who helps victims of human trafficking , said this law known as the @entity181 helps both victims and prosecutors			1
victims get a visa to live in the @entity7 and prosecutors get powerful testimony to build strong cases against suspects of human trafficking			1
" they actually have quite a few rights , but unfortunately that 's not widely known among both the immigrant community and @entity7 citizens , " said @entity190			2
@entity9 has now moved to a different city in the @entity7 , where she tries to live a normal life			1
she 's still afraid of retribution and wants to remain anonymous			0
asked why she decided to share her painful experience , she pauses for a moment and then answers without hesitation			0
" because i want authorities to realize that this is a problem and a serious one , " she said			2
" also , i want parents to know that sometimes because of their work they forget about their children , especially girls , and leave them abandoned			0
