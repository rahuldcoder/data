editor 's note : @entity2 is founder and director of @entity5 , " an online e-village promoting volunteerism , social responsibility , and sustainable change			1
" one of her initiatives , " @entity12 : empowering youth through @entity17 , " will be seen as part of @entity15 's " @entity14			2
" her first book is being published by @entity20 in may , 2010 , titled , " if @entity21 , build one : how i found meaning through a life of service to others and 100 + ways you can too			2
" @entity2 says focusing on problems facing african - americans is difficult but necessary			1
( @entity15 ) -- in the words of my mentor and @entity34 's foremost child advocate @entity32 , founder and president of @entity36 , it 's time to " raise a ruckus people , it is time to raise a ruckus ! " @entity15 's " @entity43 " raised many critical issues facing @entity40 - @entity40 people in this great country of ours			1
it was not pretty , it was not flattering , but it was very , very frank			2
the show delved into the negative issues that have plagued the @entity40 - @entity40 community for generations , i.e. , crime , education , single parent families , drug abuse and the like			1
people sent many e-mails and letters to @entity59 and @entity15 and cried foul			0
people said " @entity43 " was not consistent with the lives of many african - american people and was one - sided			1
blogs and web sites popped up all over the place where people " raised a ruckus " about the content of the show			1
i read a lot of these comments			0
as a matter of fact , i was obsessed with people 's views for many weeks after the documentary aired			0
and the more i read , the more i got angry			0
the more i read , the more i wanted to " raise my own ruckus			0
" but i was frustrated and upset for a very different reason than most			0
i was almost apoplectic with the amount of criticism for " @entity43 " without critical , thought provoking commentary about how each person can do their part to make a difference to change the very startling and distressing issues facing most @entity40 children and adults in @entity34			1
on a typical day in the lives of black @entity40 children : and on a typical school day for black children in @entity34 : and consider that in @entity34 , [ statistics are from the @entity36 's @entity97			1
] this is serious stuff people			0
and it is the cold - hearted truth			0
so , it is okay to comment that the documentary did not represent your life			0
it is okay to comment that it was upsetting to see images of black men in jail , children dropping out of school , and unwed mothers			2
it is okay because the truth hurts , especially when it is seen by 16 million people			0
in fact , most of the images shown in " @entity43 " do not represent my personal life or the lives of my children			1
but because these issues face my brothers and sisters in my collective @entity40 - @entity40 family , they concern me , they hurt me , they belong to me , and i will own them			0
we know that as african - americans we have come a long way			0
we know that we are doctors , lawyers , ceos , philanthropists , politicians , and even the president of the @entity34			0
and yes , it would do our children a lot of good if these images were portrayed more frequently in the media			2
but this does not change the very real issues facing @entity40 - @entity40 people portrayed in " @entity43			1
" and frankly , with so many of our people struggling , we ca n't just celebrate our achievements -- we must make it a priority to work on the most critical and urgent matters in our community			1
as i always say , " the blessed and the best of us , must take care of the rest of us			0
" so why did the criticism make me so mad ? because so much of it was unaccompanied by real ideas , thought - provoking suggestions , plans of action , or inspiring initiatives or solutions			2
how can you complain if you are unwilling to join the fight ? how can you get mad , if you are disinclined to make a difference in someone else 's life ? and why would you take the time to write an accusatory e-mail to @entity59 instead of writing a letter to your representative in @entity172 demanding health care for all children and pregnant women , increased funding for schools , or new initiatives to increase black - owned businesses in black neighborhoods ? " @entity14 " will offer many solutions to the ills facing @entity40 - @entity40 people			1
i think it will make the naysayers happy			2
but it will only make me happy if the naysayers " raise a ruckus " by joining the fight to better the lives of all black folks			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : some critical of " @entity43 " focus on problems
she says community has serious *challenges* to *overcome* , particularly for children
@entity203 " will show solutions
she says naysayers must join the fight to improve *conditions*
