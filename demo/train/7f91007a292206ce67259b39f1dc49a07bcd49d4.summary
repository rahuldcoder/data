-- a torrent of leaked @entity3 diplomatic cables obtained by the anti-secrecy group @entity4 has been published in the last few days , with at least 170 of them naming sources whose identity was meant to be protected , according to an analysis of the documents by @entity0			1
altogether nearly 143,000 of the cables obtained by @entity4 last year had been published by tuesday , out of a total of 251,000 the group says it possesses			1
academics in @entity24 , human rights activists in @entity22 , bankers in @entity14 , a @entity16 executive in @entity17 and @entity19 members of @entity20 are among dozens of confidential sources named in the cables , which have appeared unredacted on websites such as @entity29			1
on its website tuesday , @entity4 said it had published 133,877 cables in the past week , but has denied any part in releasing unredacted cables , maintaining that it was " totally false " to suggest it had exposed any sources			1
on its @entity35 feed @entity4 said : " the issue relates to a mainstream media partner and a malicious individual			1
" @entity4 originally worked with a number of media outlets to redact the cables , but has recently fallen out with several of them , including the @entity43 and @entity44 in the @entity19			1
@entity4 said a story on the latest releases that appeared in tuesday 's edition of the @entity43 , was a " sleazy hack job			1
" just how the unredacted cables found their way onto websites remains a matter of dispute			2
last week a @entity55 magazine , @entity56 , said it had found a large encrypted file online and was able to obtain the password to unlock it			2
the @entity4 website was only intermittently available late tuesday and wednesday			1
the group said it had been a target of a cyber attack , saying on its @entity35 feed tuesday : " @entity4 is presently under attack			1
" responding to the latest releases , @entity66 spokeswoman @entity65 said tuesday : " we continue to carefully monitor what becomes public and to take steps to mitigate the damage to national security and to assist those who may be harmed by these illegal disclosures to the extent that we can			2
" the @entity3 government has previously said that it reached out to sources whose names were in the cables			1
some at risk from possible exposure in the cables are said to have been relocated			2
some sources face at worst potential embarrassment by being identified as sources , and many of the cables are marked as " confidential " rather than " secret			1
" but for others , especially in states with authoritarian regimes , their contacts with @entity3 officials may be more hazardous			1
one cable sent from the @entity3 embassy in @entity22 in 2009 requested that the identity of three sources be strictly protected			1
two were human rights activists , one of whom was briefly detained this year as unrest spread across the country			0
it does not appear that the activist 's detention in may was linked to the cable			0
a " confidential " cable sent from the @entity107 in @entity108 in 2007 discussed @entity110 judges who might be nominated to the @entity111 investigating the assassination of former prime minister @entity113			0
the cable , from then @entity3 ambassador @entity115 , notes : " strictly protect			0
these persons are at risk of being threatened or assassinated for agreeing to act as @entity111 judges			0
" the cable goes on to say that one possible nominee had confided to @entity3 diplomats that " as an unmarried bachelor with no children and no close relatives in @entity110 , he is more dispensable than judges with family obligations			0
" another cable that quoted several representatives of @entity132 's @entity131 community was marked " protect all			0
" a cable from the embassy in @entity136 discussed alleged links between pollution and birth defects			0
two expert informants -- both @entity24 -- were marked " strictly protect " , one of whom confided that " the @entity24 government , in her view , does " not encourage " information about the relationship between pollution and birth defects to be made available			0
not all those identified are informants			0
one cable names 23 @entity149 alleged to have had contact with the radical @entity152 cleric @entity151 in @entity153			0
the cable , sent by the @entity107 in @entity155 in january 2010 recommends that all of them are placed on no - fly or terrorism watch lists			0
the @entity149 attorney general @entity159 condemned the publication of the cable tuesday -- saying that in the past " @entity4 has decided to redact identifying features where security operations or safety could be put at risk			2
this has not occurred in this case			0
" @entity4 founder @entity168 responded that the @entity149 government had been caught " ratting out 23 @entity149 to the @entity3 embassy without due process			2
" @entity3 diplomats fear that the sudden release of so many cables , including the identities of many informants , will have a chilling effect on sources in the future , as well as posing problems for some of those now readily identifiable through the unredacted cables circulating online			2
