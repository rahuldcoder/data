-- in honor of the one - year anniversary of her groundbreaking self - titled work , @entity1 has taken us by surprise yet again			1
the superstar singer gets personal in a nearly 12 - minute short film titled " @entity9 , " which was released friday without warning , much in the same way she unleashed her album " @entity1 " in december 2013			1
the result is a visually arresting piece that also includes nuggets of insight from @entity1 , who speaks on a range of topics from feminism to fame to marriage			1
here 's what we learned : ' humanist ' rather than ' feminist ' one of the biggest hits from " @entity1 " is the track " * * * @entity34 , " which uses a snippet from a 2013 @entity30 talk given by writer @entity31 called " we should all @entity32			1
" though @entity1 's always been a proponent of female empowerment , even going back to her @entity37 days , she admits in her short film that she was initially skittish around the word " feminist			1
" " i 've always considered myself a feminist , although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it , " @entity1 says			1
" when honestly , it 's very simple			1
it 's just a person that believes in equality for men and women			1
men and women balance each other out , and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other			2
" when it comes to men and the cultural pressures they face , " i have a lot of empathy , " @entity1 continues			1
" i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through			2
... i consider myself a humanist			2
" ' the property of the public ' no one is immune to the price of fame , and that includes @entity1			1
with global stardom , " you become the property of the public , " she laments			2
" there 's nothing real about it			2
" to be honest , " i sometimes wish that i could just be anonymous and walk down a street like everyone else , " she adds			2
" before i was famous , i was the girl on the hill with the guitar			2
i was the girl that just wanted a beautiful view of the beach			0
and now that i 'm famous , it 's really , really difficult to do very simple things			0
i think it 's the hardest thing to give up			0
" @entity0 10 : @entity1 and more of 2014 's most influential entertainers ' never make excuses ' that said , @entity1 is never one to play the victim			1
" my mother always taught me to be strong , " she says			0
" never make excuses ; never expect anyone else to provide for me things that i know i can provide for myself			0
i have dreams , and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams become a reality			0
" ' we 're supposed to depend on each other ' there are those who think they 'll " lose something when they get married , but it does n't have to be that way , " @entity1 , who 's been married to @entity98 for six years , reflects			1
" there 's nothing more exciting about having a witness to your life			0
" and beyond that , she sees something powerful in partnership			0
" you know , everybody 's not good at everything			0
it 's ok to depend on someone ; it 's actually what we 're supposed to do , " she says			0
" we 're supposed to depend on each other , and when you find the person that you trust and you love and that you feel that is going to respect you and take all of the s * * * that you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you , it feeds you			0
it is the most powerful thing you can ever feel in your life			0
... one thing that 's for sure : the love that i have for music , for my husband , for my child , is something that will last far beyond my life			0
