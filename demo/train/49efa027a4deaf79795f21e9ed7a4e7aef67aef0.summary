-- after months of psychological torment by guards loyal to @entity5 leader @entity4 , when a commotion arose outside the door of his solitary confinement cell in @entity10 's most notorious prison , @entity1 was sure he was going to be executed			1
but what happened next is sure to be the @entity14 - based adventure writer 's wildest chapter yet			1
reached by phone in a safe house in @entity10 , @entity1 , 32 , described a harrowing 30 hours that took him from @entity9 to the safe house under the protection of @entity22 rebels			1
the freelance journalist and aspiring travel writer had not been heard from since mid-march , shortly before he was arrested in the city of @entity26 by forces loyal to @entity4			1
he had been without contact with any family member , government official or aid organization since march 12 , when he last spoke to his mother			2
early wednesday in @entity10 , he said , he heard prisoners yelling and shouting and banging , not unlike the sounds he had heard as guards rousted out other prisoners during his six months of solitary confinement			1
as he stared at the white walls where he had ticked off the days until he lost track , he thought , " this is it , they 've come to lynch me			0
" a hand opened the small slit in the door where his food was passed through			0
he heard someone angrily shouting and pointing at verses in an open @entity51 pushed through the door			0
not long after , someone hammered off the lock on the door			0
at first he thought it was a trap , he told his mother by phone , maybe a ruse to get him in greater danger			0
but then the realization dawned : he had a chance to escape			0
" i saw some other prisoners and they were cheering and pointing down the hall , " said an exhausted @entity1			1
" i knew i was free , but did n't know what to do or what was going on			0
" @entity1 had no possessions to gather up , only a wet and ragged prison uniform			1
he found a pair of sandals left behind by another fleeing prisoner and then escaped the prison along with hundreds of other inmates			1
many of those held in the facility were political prisoners , or had been caught up in crackdowns on rebel sympathizers or on the many battlefields edging closer to the capital			0
@entity1 joined up with one small group walking through the @entity9 neighborhood of @entity10 , not knowing that they were in one of the last areas still controlled by @entity4 loyalists			1
they could hear explosions and gunfire , but also got news that rebels were taking control of the city			2
the group made their way to a mosque			0
there , the imam and other neighborhood leaders were handing out cash , trying to help people desperately short of supplies amid the chaos and electrical blackout in the area			0
@entity1 said he moved on , to a makeshift hospital where he got some help and directions to a local wealthy person who had access to a working phone			1
it was there he was able to make his first phone call back to his worried girlfriend , @entity112 , and mother , @entity114 , back in @entity14			1
" i 've always known he was ok , " @entity114 told @entity0 late wednesday			2
the retired schoolteacher described the relief and surprise she felt after watching @entity0 endlessly for days , hoping for news and praying for her son 's safety			0
now she and @entity112 are focused on getting him out of @entity5			1
@entity1 said he was eventually able to hook up with another escaped inmate who had ties to rebel forces and could speak @entity125			2
the man gained access to a car and two guards armed with @entity131 assault rifles , and they sped through the night past rebel checkpoints			0
eventually he arrived at a house once occupied by an @entity135 expatriate couple who had hastily fled in the earliest days of the conflict			0
@entity1 said the home still had food on the counters , remnants from the last - second escape of the last people there , a welcome windfall for him after months of rancid prison food			1
and the working phone there was a lifeline to the outside , he added			0
the writer is one of at least four @entity135 civilians who have been freed from @entity5 prisons , the @entity135 government said wednesday			1
" we can confirm that all @entity135 citizens who were known to be detained in @entity5 have been released , " @entity154 department spokesperson @entity157 said in a prepared statement : " the families of those detained individuals have been notified of their freedom and welfare			2
we remain concerned about the welfare and safety of those @entity135 citizens who remain in @entity10			2
for safety and privacy reasons we are unable to provide additional details			0
" @entity1 was surprised to hear that other @entity135 had been held in the prison and was unaware of their escape or current situations			1
having traveled to nearly a dozen @entity172 and @entity173 countries since 2007 , @entity1 left for @entity174 in late february			2
friends there had told him what was happening in @entity5 during the early stages of the revolution			2
" he had a great respect for the people and the country , not the politics , " his mother said			0
@entity1 's loved ones are n't certain why he was arrested , although he had a @entity135 passport and press credentials when he was seized on a day trip to @entity26			1
by phone , the exhausted writer said he would have a fuller account to tell of his capture after he was able to sleep and recuperate , but he said his arrest had been a surprise and he did not know the reason for it			2
@entity1 had been confined in two prisons , including @entity9 , from which he and the hundreds of others escaped wednesday , one day after rebels seized @entity4 's compound in the city			1
@entity5 officials had recently acknowledged @entity1 was in custody			1
his mother traveled to @entity206 in may to seek assistance in his release , but the country had just closed its embassy in @entity10			2
his family , which has been assisted by the @entity213 and @entity135 rep. @entity214 of @entity215 , hopes to see @entity1 in several days			2
" he said he was in good physical health , " said his mother			0
" he was sorry we did not know for sure he was ok			0
" @entity114 said her son was unaware that @entity220 leader @entity219 had been killed by @entity135 commandos in may			0
she and @entity112 , 28 , expect @entity1 , who first went to @entity5 in 2008 , to complete a book about the people he has met and places he has seen in @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity206 , @entity227 , @entity228 and other countries			1
he toured several of those nations by motorcycle			0
" despite everything , i have no problems with @entity5 , " @entity1 said , describing his safety and plans in @entity10			1
" but i 'll be determined to stay here to see the end of @entity4			0

@entity1 had been in solitary confinement since march
