-- it came closer ... closer ... and then it started heading away			0
but you may not have noticed at all			0
an asteroid passed relatively close to @entity4 around 2:24 p.m. et friday			1
as scientists had been predicting all week , it did not hit			0
an unrelated meteor entered the atmosphere over @entity9 on friday , hours before the much larger asteroid 's fly - by , injuring about 1,000 people			2
scientists say that incident was a pure coincidence			0
the larger asteroid , called 2012 @entity14 , never got closer than 17,100 miles to our planet 's surface			2
stargazers in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 could see the asteroid with the aid of a telescope or binoculars			2
at the @entity27 in @entity19 , the asteroid appeared as a bright white streak as viewers watched a live @entity31 video feed			1
scientists are studying this asteroid so extensively that they can already predict its path for most of the 21st century , said @entity36 of @entity31 's @entity38 team			1
but it is only one of thousands of objects that are destined to one day enter our neighborhood in space			0
" there are lots of asteroids that we 're watching that we have n't yet ruled out an @entity4 impact ( for ) , but all of them have an impact probability that is very , very low , " @entity45 , manager of the @entity46 at @entity31 's @entity47 , said at a press briefing			1
5 things to know about meteors and asteroids the long and short of it the asteroid is thought to be 45 meters -- about half a football field -- long			0
current estimates suggest that the @entity9 meteor -- which was a tiny asteroid before it hit the @entity4 's atmosphere -- was only 15 meters wide , making it much harder to detect			1
an object the size of asteroid 2012 @entity14 appears to hit @entity4 about once every 1,200 years , @entity45 said			1
" there really has n't been a close approach that we know about for an object of this size , " he added			1
the @entity72 : @entity45 talks about his work on its close approach to @entity4 , it was predicted the asteroid would be traveling at 7.8 kilometers per second , roughly eight times the speed of a bullet from a high - speed rifle , he said			1
if it had hit our planet -- which was impossible -- it would have done so with the energy of 2.4 megatons of @entity84 , @entity45 said			0
this is comparable to the event in @entity87 , @entity9 , in 1908			0
that asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded , leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two - thirds the size of @entity94			1
like that rock , 2012 @entity14 would likely not have left a crater			0
what else is out there ? so , we knew that this particular asteroid was n't going to hit us , but how about all of those other giant rocks floating nearby beyond our atmosphere ? @entity31 says 9,697 objects have been classified as near - @entity4 objects , or @entity38 , as of february 12			1
near - @entity4 objects are comets or asteroids in orbits that allow them to enter @entity4 's neighborhood			1
there 's an important distinction between these two types of objects : comets are mostly water , ice and dust , while asteroids are mostly rock or metal			0
both comets and asteroids have hit @entity4 in the past			2
what would happen if the asteroid hit more than 1,300 near - @entity4 objects have been classified as potentially hazardous to @entity4 , meaning that someday they may come close or hit our home planet			1
@entity31 is monitoring these objects and updating their locations as new information comes in			1
right now , scientists are n't warning of any imminent threats			0
@entity137 and colleagues are using telescopes on the ground and in space to nail down the precise orbit of objects that might threaten @entity4 and predict whether the planet could be hit			1
observatories around the world send their findings to the @entity31 - funded @entity148 , which keeps a database of all known asteroids and comets in our solar system			2
@entity31 also has a space probe tracking asteroids to learn more about them			2
the @entity157 probe was launched in 2007 and has already sent back dramatic pictures from the giant asteroid @entity160			2
the spacecraft is now heading to the dwarf planet @entity162			0
@entity160 and @entity162 are the two most massive objects in the main asteroid belt			2
although scientists know a lot about the path of 2012 @entity14 , there are many undiscovered near - @entity4 objects still out there			1
it 's possible that a flash of light and shaking of the ground would be the first indications that something happened			0
with the @entity9 meteor , for example , there was no warning			0
many teams of astronomers are using electronic cameras to find these near - earth objects , but according to @entity31 , the entire effort consists of fewer than 100 people			1
new asteroid adventure in 2016 a mission that 's scheduled to launch in 2016 will teach scientists even more about asteroids			2
@entity193 will visit an asteroid called 1999 @entity195 , take a sample of at least 2.1 ounces and bring it back to @entity4			1
" this is going to be the largest sample of an extraterrestrial object returned to @entity4 since end of the @entity206 missions over 40 years ago , " said @entity197 , deputy principal investigator for the mission , who is based at the @entity199 , @entity200			1
the probe will arrive at the asteroid in 2018 , study it , and then bring back the sample in 2023			1
1999 @entity195 is made of materials " almost identical to those that were present when the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago , " @entity197 said			0
that means studying this asteroid could yield greater understanding about the sources of organic molecules and water that gave rise to life			0
because the asteroid is among those cataloged as a near - @entity4 object , the mission would further clarify the threat that this particular object poses , and better predict the orbits of other near - @entity4 asteroids , @entity197 said			1
scientists at the @entity199 are collaborating with @entity31 and @entity231 on this mission			2
to better predict the orbits of hazardous objects , the group is looking at the @entity237 effect , a force created when the asteroid absorbs sunlight and re-radiates it as heat			2
the effect is , at first glance , quite small -- @entity197 cited his colleague @entity245 's comparison of this effect to the force a person feels when holding grapes in a hand			0
but over time , it 's an important consideration when trying to understand where an asteroid is headed			0
" that force , applied over millions of years , can literally move mountains of rock around , " @entity197 said			0
but -- and we ca n't say this enough : do n't panic over it			0

the @entity193 mission will take a sample from a different asteroid and bring it back
