@entity0 -- a @entity5 man suffering from " locked - in syndrome " who fought a long legal battle over assisted suicide died wednesday , his family said			1
@entity10 , 58 , had been refusing food since last week , contracted pneumonia over the weekend , and " went downhill rapidly , " said his lawyer , @entity13			1
" before he died , he asked us to tweet : ' goodbye world the time has come , i had some fun , ' " his @entity15 account said			1
the former rugby player was left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago , and lost a @entity25 battle last week to gain a legal right to end his life when he chose			1
the fight seemed to go out of him after the court 's decision , leaving him " heartbroken , " @entity13 said after his death was announced			1
his wife , sister and daughters were with him when he died , she said			0
" he was gutsy , determined and a fighter to the end , " said @entity13 , adding it had been " an absolute privilege " to represent him			0
his legal case will not continue unless someone " in similar circumstances " steps forward to pursue it , she said			1
police in the county of @entity46 , where he lived , said that a doctor had been seeing @entity10 over the past week , and that they were not investigating the death			1
his condition meant it was impossible for him to take his own life , and he wanted the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution			2
" most of my body is paralyzed , but my mind is as it was before the stroke			1
all i can move is my head , and the stroke took away my power of speech			2
now i talk to people with a perspex spelling board or a computer operated by my eye blinks , " he told @entity1 in an interview in june			0
while expressing sympathy for his situation , the @entity25 ruled august 16 that such a significant change to the law -- involving overturning the ban on voluntary euthanasia -- would have to be decided by lawmakers			2
the judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering from locked - in syndrome , named only as @entity83			2
psychiatrist : i hate suicide but also understand it " the cases raise profoundly difficult ethical , social and legal issues , but ( the court ) judged that any change to the law must be a matter for @entity95 to decide , " a statement from the court said			1
the ruling upset @entity10 , who cried as his wife , @entity96 , told the waiting media that the family was " bitterly disappointed " and would file an appeal			1
" all too often , well - meaning able - bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide , he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice , " he said in june			2
" i say that where a person has the mental ability , he should have the choice of his own life or death			2
the only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life , " he said			0
in a statement given via his computer last week after the decision , @entity10 said : " it 's not the result i was hoping for but it is n't entirely unexpected			1
judges , like politicians , are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgment is not an exception to the rule			0
" i believe the legal team acting on my behalf is prepared to go all the way with this , but unfortunately for me it means yet another period of physical discomfort , misery and mental anguish while we find out who controls my life -- me or the state			0
" his daughters , tweeting on his behalf , urged people to sign a petition via his @entity15 account supporting his " right to die with dignity			0
" within hours , thousands of people had added their names			0
@entity148 said the family did not intend to go to @entity150 , which has an assisted suicide law , because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die			1
before his stroke at age 51 , the couple lived a comfortable life in the @entity158 and traveled extensively			0
speaking to @entity1 in june , @entity148 described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the " life and soul of the party , " making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear			0
" he was a big bloke , ex-rugby player , he worked hard but he played hard , " she said			0
" he was full of life , great sense of humor , loved the sound of his own voice			0
" @entity1 's @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
