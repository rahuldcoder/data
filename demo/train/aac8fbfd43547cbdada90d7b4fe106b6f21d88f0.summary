-- retrospectives of @entity3 's life over the next few days are likely to include the words " ground - breaking , " " trailblazer , " " inspiration " and " mentor			1
she epitomized these words and so many more			0
to me , she was also a classmate , a crewmate , a collaborator and a friend			1
@entity3 and i first crossed paths in the first grade at @entity16 in @entity17 in 1958 , though neither of us remembered the other clearly			1
we had a good laugh as we pieced this together 20 years later , when we met as two of the first six women in @entity26 's astronaut corps			1
@entity3 opens a new frontier for others it was n't the only similarity in our backgrounds			1
we shared a love for competitive sports , and our college careers revealed that we both loved arts and letters as much as the sciences			1
the second point paid many dividends later on , in great crossword challenges during crew quarantine and many shared lecture engagements			0
@entity43 : @entity3 inspired me to dream we six women in the @entity47 ranged in age from 39 ( @entity49 ) to 26 ( @entity3 and me )			1
underneath our different professional backgrounds and personal styles , we had many points in common : all six were intelligent , goal - oriented , creative and strong			0
we each had chosen our career path because it suited our talents and fired our passion , not in pursuit of celebrity			0
light years : tributes pour in for @entity3 but we found ourselves on a very different stage			1
we bonded as we took on the challenges that came with being the first six women in the @entity65 astronaut corps , from the glare of the media spotlight to the everyday challenges of the workplace			0
we were keenly aware that what we did , and how we did it , would lay the ground for all the women who would come after us			0
we had to do it right			0
which is not to say we could n't have fun while we were at it			0
@entity3 was one of the quickest wits and keenest pranksters in our class			1
she was the master of the clever , perfectly timed retort			1
@entity3 , first @entity65 woman in space , dies a favorite memory is from our first morning in orbit in 1984			1
@entity86 woke us up with the standard mix of a bit of music and words to the effect of , " good morning , @entity92			0
" instead of the normal response , " @entity97 , " @entity3 launched into an answering machine reply : " we 're sorry nobody can take your call right now			1
please leave your name and number ... " our grins turned to guffaws when the @entity105 replied with his name and a real phone number for @entity86			0
we carried her joke on throughout the flight , with everyone taking turns at making up the morning 's fake answering machine message			0
" why was @entity3 tapped to fly first ? " is a question i 've been asked many times in the past few days			2
the truth is , none of us ever knew , not even @entity3			2
whatever the reasons may have been , history will record that the selection turned out well indeed			0
@entity3 performed superbly on @entity124 and stepped into the role of first @entity65 woman to fly in space with intelligence , dignity and grace			2
thank you , @entity3 with the distinction she earned in 1983 , @entity3 was free to write her own ticket to life			2
that she chose to devote her energies to teaching and inspiring others to dream , to dare and to aspire to excellence speaks volumes about her character			0
she wanted to share her wonderment about the universe and joy of learning with others			0
she was committed to breaking down the cultural and educational barriers that block so many , especially young girls , from science and the opportunities it offers in life			2
and this she did , through her work as a physics professor , mentor , motivator and businesswoman			0
@entity3 's place in history is solidly established by her many contributions to science , spaceflight and the @entity65 space program			1
but i daresay her greatest legacy lies in her post-nasa work as an educator and a role model			2
light years : memories of my space flight with @entity3 she inspired countless people to reach for the stars her spirit will live on in each and every one of them and in all of us who called her a friend			1
share your tributes to @entity3 with us on @entity43			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

former astronaut @entity181 was @entity3 's classmate , *colleague* and crewmate
@entity181 says @entity3 loved pranks , was master of the clever , perfectly timed retort
ride will be remembered for her contributions to science and spaceflight , she says
but @entity3 's best legacy , she writes , is her work inspiring young people to study sciences
