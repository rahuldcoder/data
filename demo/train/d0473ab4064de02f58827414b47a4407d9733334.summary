-- an extraordinary thing is about to happen in my native state			2
more than three decades of communism is about to fall -- not through revolution or bloodshed but by the sheer power of the ballot box			2
even as communism waned around the world with the disintegration of the @entity15 empire , @entity10 's communists built up a political dynasty in @entity17 , winning seven consecutive state elections in the world 's largest democracy			1
but if election results to be announced friday are as predicted , one of the world 's little - known bastions of communism will be no more			1
exit polls this week confirmed what political analysts have been predicting for months			2
the @entity29 , firmly entrenched in @entity10 since 1977 , will go down in defeat to the populist @entity31			1
people have descended on the state capital , @entity34 , this week to watch the retreat of the red tide , to document for themselves a pivotal moment of @entity39 history			0
local media outlets reported record turnout in the state elections that were staggered over several weeks to ensure security and transparency			0
word on the street from many who voted against the communists was this : we need change			2
led by the former railway minister @entity52 , @entity31 won support as the champion of the poor and through its alliance with the @entity57 that rules @entity17			1
the fiery @entity52 , known affectionately as " @entity60 , " the @entity39 word for elder sister , has pledged to revive industry and agriculture in @entity10 , a state that has seen its economy plummet under the communists			1
the communists rose to power on promises of land reform for the millions of the state 's rural and impoverished residents			1
" the @entity31 governments in the past were all urban oriented and connected with the landed gentry , " said @entity70 , a professor of international relations at @entity34 's @entity72			2
" the idea was to economically enfranchise the rural poor who had been long neglected in the past			0
" the ideology was appropriate for the time , when huge numbers of people were marginalized , @entity70 said			0
the communists gave them hope for a new life			2
but after three decades , many questioned the relevancy of their ideas in a modern , fast - growing @entity17			1
critics accused @entity10 's @entity91 leaders of corruption , cronyism and failing to deliver what they promised to the people			1
" i watched the city of my childhood steadily go to ruin , " said political scientist @entity96			2
" unions rose , industry fled , law and order deteriorated			0
it has a significant effect on my life and the lives of my family			0
" how much real change comes to the @entity17 state remains to be seen but one thing is for sure			1
culturally , the end to a government dominated by the @entity114 ( @entity91 ) is sure to be huge			2
for decades , hammers and sickles have been plastered on buildings and billboards in @entity34 , where i was born			2
workers were routinely called to my grandfather 's house to remove the painted signage on our front wall calling for the people 's support			0
we drove down @entity129 road and past @entity131 's statue			0
and in a snub to @entity134 , the street where the @entity134 consulate stands was renamed @entity137 street after the @entity139 leader			0
we grew up with the power of labor unions and government employees who called bandhs , or strikes , that were frequent enough to paralyze the city , sometimes for days			0
the juxtaposition of communist ideology and @entity17 's thriving democracy was difficult to reconcile at times			1
" this is a real anachronism that the world has moved on but this peculiar form of communism still persists in a corner of @entity17 , " said @entity96 , who holds a chair of @entity17 cultures and civilizations at @entity154			1
perhaps even more so because it took hold in a corner of @entity17 that was known historically for its intellect , talent , skills			1
@entity10 was the home for the @entity17 intelligentsia , the birthplace of @entity17 independence			1
at one time , @entity10 was considered a leading state in @entity17			1
now , the state has lagged behind other places that were once less successful			0
@entity34 , the old capital of the @entity172 , has faded into history			0
it is a dying , run - down city , likely loved solely by natives like myself			0
young people , including many of my relatives and friends , have fled in droves to seek jobs elsewhere in @entity17			1
" and here are some people clinging on to their ideas which have no significance almost anywhere in the modern world , " @entity96 said of the communists			0
" even @entity189 ( of @entity190 ) is a populist			0
" for the younger @entity194 , some of whom have always lived under communism , enough was enough			0
" the younger generations seem fed up , " @entity70 said			0
" they have no memories beyond the left to compare with			0
" but while many in @entity10 are eagerly anticipating the end of the @entity29 , @entity70 is not sure that communist ideology will vanish with the political loss of power			1
that is evident , perhaps , in the clout of groups like the @entity209 rebels known as the @entity210 , who have launched a violent insurgency in parts of @entity17 , including @entity10			1
as long as there are millions of poor in @entity17 's still burgeoning population , @entity70 said , there will be room for the ideas of @entity129 .			1
