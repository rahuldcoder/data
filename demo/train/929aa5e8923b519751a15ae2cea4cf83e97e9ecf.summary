an attorney for the @entity15 filed the four - page document on monday , saying @entity1 " eroded public confidence " in the judicial system and " created an appearance of impropriety			1

last month , @entity1 , 72 , announced his retirement at the end of the year , when his term ends			2

@entity1 acknowledged making controversial remarks about victim @entity37 at @entity24 's sentencing in august			1

" they focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant			0
" @entity1 said he weighed all relevant factors in passing sentence			2
" the defendant 's last legal or moral transgression was the crime he committed and admitted , " he wrote			0
" in the ensuing almost six years , he had legally and morally good conduct , he was reinstated in sex offender treatment and the undisputed evidence supported community placement and treatment			0
" the length of the sentence , @entity1 's comments and the age disparity between defendant and victim drew criticism and a firestorm of media attention			1
the @entity3 attorney general 's office in november appealed the 31 - day sentence , saying it did not meet the state 's mandatory minimum sentence			1
