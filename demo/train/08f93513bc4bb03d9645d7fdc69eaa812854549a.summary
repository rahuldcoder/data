@entity1 the lawyer for the 19 - year - old man accused of killing a @entity1 woman -- allegedly after a road rage incident -- says his client feared for his life			1
@entity8 made his first court appearance monday , a brief initial hearing inside a packed @entity12 courtroom in which he did not enter a plea			0
his lawyer , @entity15 , says he will argue self - defense			1
he questions the version of events given by police and the victim 's family and claims police interviewed @entity8 while he was high on marijuana			1
in fact , the lawyer claims @entity8 asked police if he could get high during the standoff that ended in his arrest , and that police agreed			1
but @entity12 district attorney @entity28 , interviewed tuesday night on @entity29 , said he does n't think self - defense is a factor in the shooting			1
" i do n't see that in this case , " he said			2
@entity28 said authorities are looking for the person who was driving the car in which @entity8 was riding , and possibly a third person who was in the car			0
" this was a drive - by shooting			1
he shot out of a moving vehicle , " @entity28 said			0
" the driver has certain culpability			0
" @entity8 is charged with murder , attempted murder , assault and firing a gun from a car in the february 12 death of @entity51 , 44			1
police say @entity8 shot @entity53 in front of her home after a confrontation while driving			2
the victim and the suspect knew each other -- a fact the family knew but police say they only found out the day of the arrest			1
according to police , the incident began when @entity53 was giving her daughter a driving lesson at a school parking lot when " a silver four door car sped up behind them and pulled along the driver 's side of the car			1
" after the daughter honked the horn , the other car raced ahead and blocked their path , and a man got out of the car threatening them			0
@entity53 later went looking for the car with her 22 - year - old son , who was armed with a 9 mm pistol , according to police			1
after finding the car , they began following it			0
the driver stopped , and the passenger began firing at the @entity89 , according to police			2
@entity53 drove home , but the other car followed and the occupant opened fire on them in front of their house , according to police			2
@entity53 was struck in the head and died two days later			0
@entity15 said @entity53 ' son pointed a gun at @entity100 before anyone started shooting			2
he said his client received death threats , but he did not elaborate			2
road rage suspect knew victim , husband says the lawyer questions whether the alleged road rage incident between @entity53 and @entity8 occurred and has doubts about the family 's account of what happened			1
" there was no road rage , " @entity15 said			1
he said accounts of @entity8 's reported discussions of the shootings with friends do n't appear to be consistent with the road rage claim			1
he also questioned the family 's initial description of the shooting suspect			1
@entity125 ' daughter described the driver who threatened them as being 6 feet tall			0
" there are serious inconsistencies and problems with their story and i have serious concerns , " @entity15 told @entity2			0
a preliminary hearing was set for march 10 , during which investigators will reveal more of the evidence and a judge will determine whether the case should go forward			0
however , the district attorney has issued a notice that his office may go to a grand jury instead of a preliminary hearing			1
the defense says such a move would indicate something weak about the prosecutors ' case			2
@entity12 district attorney @entity28 told reporters after the hearing that prosecutors are sure of their case against @entity8			1
" it is not a straightforward case , " he said			0
" it is not a garden variety , run - of - the - mill case			2
we all know there are certain nuances to this case			0
but at the end of the day , this young man is charged with a senseless , stupid act of murder and we intend to prove it in court			0
" @entity168 's husband , @entity53 , also attended the hearing			0
" i 'll be here every court date , " he told reporters			0
@entity172 and @entity173 reported from @entity1			2
@entity174 reported and wrote from @entity175			0
@entity2 's @entity176 also contributed to this report .			0
