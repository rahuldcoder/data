-- everyone knows that it 's a time of dramatic change in @entity5 's airline industry			1
what many often fail to appreciate , however , is how much of that drama is being driven by an exponential rise of low - cost carriers ( @entity10 ) in the region			1
consider a small sampling of the recent upheaval in @entity5 's skies			2
following the dissolution of an @entity18 joint venture , @entity15 is being rebranded ( hilariously , to some ) as @entity19 ; @entity21 's @entity20 has the new name of @entity20 ; and @entity23 is expected to launch within the year ; meanwhile , @entity25 's @entity24 has been busy recording a whopping 960 % increase in profits compared with last year			1
beating out all foreign legacy and low - cost carriers , its become the third largest carrier at @entity32 's @entity31 after @entity34 and @entity33			1
while @entity5 has a remarkably high @entity10 presence of almost 50 % -- meaning more than half of total seats are sold by low - cost carriers -- @entity39 still has an extremely low @entity10 penetration and thus represents the biggest opportunity for the industry			1
@entity39 travelers who have grown partial to the over-the - top service and quality of legacy carriers in the region are still finding the concept of low - cost carriers foreign , or simply irrelevant			1
" they do n't pop up in my searches when i look on travel sites , and it just does n't occur to me to fly them because i have my existing frequent flyer programs that i feel bound to , " says frequent business traveler @entity50 , 38 , of @entity25			2
for the unacquainted , such as @entity50 , here 's a quick guide to the fleets with the often quirky names and bright liveries			0
@entity10 fleets are young and frequently built around a single model " people tend to think that low - cost carriers have these old planes , but that is a complete myth , " said @entity63 , ceo of @entity23 , in a low - cost carrier workshop earlier this month			1
" the opposite is actually true			0
" in order to keep the cost of buying planes as low as possible , low - cost carriers place bulk orders of the newest planes			1
for the same reason , each @entity10 usually has just one type of plane in its fleet -- bulk orders of the same plane get better pricing			0
when @entity23 's new @entity84 airline debuts later this year ( pending government approval ) it will be launching with 18 new @entity87 320 - 200 aircraft			2
apart from its new @entity84 fleet , @entity23 's planes across all affiliates have an average age of four to five years			0
similarly , @entity18 , the @entity92 based low - cost carrier that flies to more than 80 destinations in @entity5 , has a fleet of 141 @entity97 aircraft , with an average age of three years per plane			1
competitiveness hinges on " fast turns " and " double daily " service in aviation lingo , a " turn " means the time it takes for a plane to take off on its next flight after landing			0
for @entity111 , fast turns of about 25 - 40 minutes are imperative to keep costs down and to maintain high levels of aircraft utilization -- the time a plane is in the air each day			0
full service carriers take about an hour and a half on turns			0
even in an aviation market known for delays -- @entity122 is notorious -- lccs keep costs down by factoring delays into their schedules			0
to keep @entity111 viable for consumers , airlines need to have at least some " double daily " flights -- flights to the same destination at least twice a day			0
this means that if passengers miss their flight , they can take a flight to the same destination later the same day			0
" the target of ' double daily ' is to build scale and support integrity , " says @entity137 , @entity23 's executive director of planning and airline partnerships			0
@entity111 ' entry into a market can stimulate the overall market studies have shown that @entity10 penetration can result in overall travel market growth in a given region			1
the launch of a low - cost carrier may eat into a dominant full - service carrier 's market share , but the number of passengers in a market has been shown to increase overall , not only for the low - cost carrier , but for full - service carriers			1
the latter tend to lower prices in response to what @entity111 are offering , scrambling to adapt business models to a new landscape			0
lccs have meant the most to @entity167 @entity167 is the most interesting example of a stagnant market stimulated by the launch of low - cost carriers			1
despite being one of the largest domestic aviation markets in the world , @entity167 has showed little or no growth in passenger numbers since the turn of the century			2
" @entity167 has the unenviable distinction of being the only major market in the world to have about the same traffic today as 15 years ago , " said a @entity178 ( @entity180 ) report published in august			2
however , with the launch of three low - cost carriers in 2012 -- @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity15 -- the " abysmal " domestic aviation market grew for the first time in six years			1
with the introduction of low fares , @entity167 who could n't afford to fly began traveling , with remarkable results			2
domestic passenger numbers increased by 8.7 % in 2012 , the largest percentage growth in 20 years			0
collectively , the three low - cost carriers added 2.6 million passengers to the domestic market and @entity189 is now the largest domestic carrier from @entity199			1
" the contribution is not just in greater volumes of passengers whose traveling has a trickle - down effect across the economy , it is also in giving @entity167 's legacy carriers an incentive to become more efficient , " said the @entity180 report			1
@entity39 represents the greatest opportunity the figures speak for themselves			0
air traffic in @entity5 will increase dramatically in the next few decades			0
while @entity213 airport passenger traffic was 1.467 billion arrivals ( the largest in the world ) and @entity5 's was 1.402 billion in 2009 , @entity5 is expected to become the largest aviation market in the next few years			2
@entity217 : @entity219 's cutest planes head to the @entity213 by 2030 , @entity5 's passenger traffic is expected to exceed 4.88 billion , in contrast to 2.367 billion projected for the @entity213 , according to @entity223 's @entity222 published in 2012			2
@entity5 already has a high @entity10 penetration rate -- the @entity10 capacity share of total seats is approximately 56 - 57 % -- but the percentage for @entity39 is stunningly low at 9 %			1
" that 's a 91 % potential upside for us , " says @entity23 's @entity137			0
no wonder @entity111 are excited			0

low - cost carriers ( @entity10 ) are a major part of @entity5 's booming airline industry
@entity25 's @entity24 has recorded a 960 % increase in profits over last year
lccs have *propelled* @entity167 's once - stagnant domestic travel market
