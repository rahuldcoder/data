it 's @entity1 to the rescue			1
the superstar singer 's " 1989 " album is forecast to sell more than 1.3 million copies through november 2 , according to @entity6			1
that would break both the one - week sales record for an album by a female artist , set by the debut of @entity12 ' " oops ! ... i did it again " in 2000 , and the weekly sales record for any album since 2002 , when @entity19 's " the @entity18 " sold 1.322 million during its first full week			1
the new records would help redeem what 's been a rough year for the music industry , which has not seen a single artist go platinum in 2014 , despite offerings that generated tons of buzz , including @entity29 's secret album and @entity31 's " @entity30			2
" platinum albums ? not this year if @entity1 pulls it off , it will also be her third consecutive album to sell more than a million copies in the first week			1

" those fans were invited to listening parties at her various homes and encouraged to talk about their experiences but asked to not leak specifics , including lyrics			0
they abided by the rules , she said			0
" they did n't talk about lyrics			0
they did n't spoil the secret for other fans , " @entity1 said			2
" two days before the album came out , it leaked online , and it was the first time i 've ever had an album leak without it trending on @entity48 -- because my fans protected it			0

@entity1 's latest album is expected to go platinum in its first week
