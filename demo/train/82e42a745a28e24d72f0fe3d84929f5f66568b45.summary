sen. @entity0 broke with the field of republicans considering a 2016 presidential run on thursday , calling president @entity5 's decision to normalize relations with @entity7 a " good idea " since the @entity10 embargo against @entity7 " just has n't worked			1
" @entity0 , a likely presidential candidate , made the remarks in an interview with @entity13 800 @entity15 's @entity14 , just a day after his potential competitors for the @entity18 nomination -- former @entity20 gov. @entity19 , sen. @entity21 and sen. @entity22 -- slammed the decision to normalize relations as a dangerous move			1
@entity21 and @entity22 are sons of @entity7 immigrants			2
@entity0 joined the mostly @entity28 supporters of the decision , asserting that the embargo has n't produced results and hurts the @entity7 people rather than their autocratic rulers			2
he even likened his support to @entity10 trade with @entity36 , which he called " ultimately the best way to defeat communism			0
" " the 50 - year embargo with @entity7 just has n't worked , " @entity0 said			1
" if the goal is regime change , it sure does n't seem to be working and probably it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship			0
" @entity0 is not the only @entity18 to support @entity5 's decision to increase economic ties with @entity7			1
sen. @entity50 of @entity51 traveled with a congressional delegation to @entity7 that brought back @entity53 , the formerly imprisoned @entity10 aid worker			2
" in the end , i think probably opening up @entity7 is probably a good idea , " he said			0
he also added that he " grew up in a family as anti-communist as you can come by			0
" @entity21 , on the other hand , has led the charge against the @entity5 administration 's landmark deal with the @entity7 government , railing against @entity5 for appeasing an autocratic regime			1
" it is a lifeline for the @entity68 regime that will allow them to become more profitable ... and allow them to become a more permanent fixture , " he said wednesday			0
" the embargo is leverage , these sanctions are leverage			0

sen. @entity0 says he agrees with president @entity5 that the @entity7 embargo has n't worked
@entity0 's position is the *opposite* of other potential @entity18 2016 candidates , like sen. @entity21 and former @entity20 gov. @entity19
