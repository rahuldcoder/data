-- few players , pundits or fans would argue who the best two players in the world currently are			1
trying to choose between them is another matter			0
but not for former @entity10 striker @entity9			1
" i give preference to @entity12 , because he 's a player who fascinates us more , who shows more creativity -- even though he 's from @entity16 , which has a big rivalry with @entity10 ! " the @entity19 great told @entity0 's @entity20			1
he admires both players he says , but " @entity12 is a little above @entity9			1
" like @entity12 , the 35 - year - old is a three - time winner of the @entity25 's @entity24 and enjoyed a highly successful club career including spells at @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 -- winning two league titles with the reigning @entity33 champions			1
the 35 - year - old who finished his playing days at @entity35 in february 2011 was plagued by knee injuries during an illustrious career which reached its peak at the 2002 @entity39 in @entity40			1
@entity9 inspired @entity10 to their fifth victory in the competition , claiming the @entity45 award with eight goals -- with two coming in the final against @entity48			2
" it was an incredible experience			0
especially because after 1998 when we lost the final match to @entity52 , " said @entity9			0
hours before that final in 1998 @entity9 had what his teammates described at the time as a convulsive attack at the team hotel and was rushed to hospital			0
nonetheless he played against @entity52 -- making little contribution -- as the hosts coasted to a 3 - 0 win			2
" brazilians and players were left with that bitter taste in our mouths , " added @entity9			0
" then came the @entity39 of 2002 with big expectations and thank @entity68 we managed to make it to the final and beat @entity48			2
i scored two goals in the final , it was truly unforgettable			0
" with all eyes on @entity10 as it prepares to host the next @entity39 in 2014 , @entity9 says his country faces challenges on two fronts			1
" @entity78 , the organization of a @entity39 , which is the biggest challenge in terms of country - wide organization			2
( @entity83 ) today is a very complex event to organize , " he says			0
but it will also be a challenge to satisfy the expectations of a football - mad nation , he says			0
" the @entity19 people have high expectations about winning the cup in our own country and i 'm certain that by the time we get to the cup , our team is going to be competitive			0
" adding a sixth gold star to the famous yellow and green jersey will be difficult -- @entity10 lost to @entity99 at the quarterfinal stage at the @entity101 in @entity102 -- but not impossible , @entity9 says			0
" i think in the last victories we had in the @entity39 ( 1994 and 2002 ) , the team was traditionally created in the last year			2
so i think we still have time , " he said			0
" we have @entity107 , who is a huge talent , @entity109 , @entity110 , who is another excellent defender			1
we have a very young team , but it 's playing at a high level and gives us big hope for a victory			1
" however @entity9 also advised @entity107 , who plays for @entity19 club @entity117 , to sign for a @entity119 club and help him join the level @entity12 and @entity9 are playing at			1
" i think @entity107 still has a phase to compete -- to play in @entity122 and triumph playing in @entity122 , " added the @entity19 great .			2

former @entity10 striker picks @entity12 ahead of @entity126 forward as world 's best player
three - time winner of @entity24 and *double* @entity39 winner *confident* @entity10 will be great hosts in 2014
the 35 - year - old says young players like @entity107 , @entity109 and @entity110 give @entity10 hope of victory
