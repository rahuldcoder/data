fifty - one of the executions occurred in january and 14 so far this month , it said			0
" the @entity6 government seems to have given state executioners the green light to execute at will , " said @entity15 , deputy @entity16 director at @entity9			1
" the government needs to declare an immediate moratorium on all executions and begin an overhaul of its flawed criminal justice system			0
" the organization said it was particularly concerned that @entity6 courts use coerced confessions as evidence			1
" the government should disclose the identities , locations , and status of all prisoners on death row , the crimes for which they have been convicted , court records for their being charged , tried , and sentenced , and details of any impending executions , " @entity9 said			1
the @entity41 @entity40 expressed shock late last month over reports that 34 individuals , including two women , had been executed in @entity6 on january 19 following their convictions for crimes			2
" even if the most scrupulous fair trial standards were observed , this would be a terrifying number of executions to take place in a single day , " @entity40 said			0
" given the lack of transparency in court proceedings , major concerns about due process and fairness of trials , and the very wide range of offenses for which the death penalty can be imposed in @entity6 , it is a truly shocking figure			0
" more than 1,200 people are believed to have been sentenced to death since 2004 , though the number executed is not known , she said			0

" in a statement on the ministry 's website , he said , " questioning the credibility of the @entity6 judiciary system by the @entity41 high commissioner is ( a ) strange thing and the high commissioner should also ( be ) aware of the size of the challenges that @entity6 is facing by terrorist groups who had committed heinous crimes and mass executions against innocent people " @entity9 says it opposes capital punishment " because of its inhumane nature and its finality			1
" in its statement , the group says that criminal trials in @entity6 often violate standards of fairness , right to defense counsel , right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and not to be compelled to confess			0
