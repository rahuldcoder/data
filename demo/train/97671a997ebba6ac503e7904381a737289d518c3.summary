@entity4 the unraveling security situation in @entity1 -- the same country president @entity3 cited as a model for his fight against @entity8 -- could throw the president 's counterterror message into question ahead of tuesday 's @entity13 address			1
in @entity15 on tuesday , the presidential palace was overrun by @entity17 rebels , a situation the country 's minister of information described as the " completion of a coup			1
" that 's a problem for the @entity24 , which has relied on the government in @entity1 as an ally in battling the @entity28 affiliate that 's based there			1
a power vacuum could benefit @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , the terrorist offshoot that @entity24 officials consider the most dangerous branch of the global jihadi network			0
@entity3 himself cited the @entity24 - @entity1 partnership when he announced in september he was going after @entity8 terrorists in @entity38 and @entity39			1
explaining why he was ruling out sending @entity24 troops to fight @entity8 , @entity3 said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in @entity1 and @entity44 to partner with governments to go after terrorists			1
" this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us , while supporting partners on the front lines , is one that we have successfully pursued in @entity1 and @entity44 for years , " @entity3 said on september 10			2
" it is consistent with the approach i outlined earlier this year : to use force against anyone who threatens @entity24 's core interests , but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order			0
" what that strategy relied on , however , was a strong partnership between the @entity24 and the existing government in @entity1 , led by president @entity64			1
@entity64 reorganized @entity1 's military to better go after @entity31 , a strategy that worked for a time			2
but the plan was waylaid when resources were diverted to battle the militant @entity71 , a @entity17 group who say they feel marginalized in the majority @entity74 country			0
@entity76 have seized upon the latest news from @entity1 to illustrate their opposition to @entity3 's terrorism strategy			2
sen. @entity80 , now the chairman of the @entity81 , tweeted " the ' success story ' of @entity1 continues to unfold " on tuesday , followed by a link to a news report about the violence there			1
when pressed by @entity5 in september whether @entity24 efforts in @entity1 could be described as a " success , " the @entity87 said the strategy there has worked			2
@entity1 is " a place where the @entity24 counterterrorism strategy that has been put in place by president @entity3 has succeeded in degrading the threat that those organizations pose to the @entity24 , " press secretary @entity92 said			1
" we intend to implement an analogous strategy against @entity8			0
" during tuesday 's @entity13 , @entity3 will " talk broadly about our counterterrorism strategy as part of our national security strategy , and as part of our way to make sure @entity24 principles are held up throughout the world , " according to @entity87 spokesman @entity108			0
a senior administration official said @entity3 was being updated on the situation in @entity1 by his national security team			0
" we strongly condemn the violence and those stoking it in an effort to disrupt @entity1 's political transition			0
we will continue to support efforts to bring about a peaceful solution , " the official said .			0
