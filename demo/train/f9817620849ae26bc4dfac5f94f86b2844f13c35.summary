-- acting on a conservative battle cry and potentially triggering a court battle with the @entity6 administration , the @entity2 - led @entity1 voted wednesday to hold former @entity8 official @entity7 in contempt of @entity10 for refusing to answer questions about her agency 's targeting of conservative and other groups			1
the 231 - 187 vote fell almost entirely along party lines , a decision that cut across three sharp divides : balance of power issues between the branches of government , political questions over the @entity8 scandal , and a @entity26 debate over @entity7 's individual fifth amendment rights			1
@entity7 is in the middle of that trio			2
until she retired last year , she ran the @entity8 division in charge of tax exempt status			2
an inspector general 's report concluded her staff had inappropriately targeted @entity36 and other groups for extra scrutiny			0
the term " progressive " was also flagged but the inspector general report indicated that conservative terms drew more attention from the @entity8			2
the @entity44 question for nearly a year , @entity7 has refused @entity1 requests to testify on the matter , citing her @entity44 right against self - incrimination			1
@entity2 insist that does n't apply here , that she waived the right by first asserting her innocence when she appeared before the @entity52 last may			2
" mrs. @entity7 made 17 separate factual assertions before invoking her right to remain silent , " proclaimed rep. @entity53 , @entity2 of @entity54 , as he opened up wednesday 's debate			1
" you ca n't make selective assertions and still invoke your fifth amendment right			0
" @entity7 's attorney , @entity61 , has dismissed that argument repeatedly and sent a statement rejecting it again wednesday			2
" today 's vote has nothing to do with the facts or the law , " @entity61 wrote			0
" its only purpose is to keep the baseless @entity8 ' conspiracy ' alive through the midterm elections			0
ms. @entity7 has not committed contempt of @entity10			1
she did not waive her fifth amendment rights by proclaiming her innocence			1
" the politics as they reject @entity7 's @entity26 argument , @entity2 see an @entity8 scandal that remains highly flammable on the right			1
to conservatives , it is a frightening case of a government agency suppressing political thought from its opponents , mixed with question marks about whether anyone in the @entity1 was involved			0
" if we do n't hold @entity7 accountable for her actions , " said rep. @entity86 , @entity2 of @entity87 , " then we 're sending a message to future administrations that this type of nixonian behavior is acceptable			1
" the problem for @entity2 has been that as their base clamors for action and high - ranking heads to roll on the scandal , neither @entity7 nor anyone at the @entity8 has provided information linking the controversy to the @entity1			1
as determined as @entity2 have been , @entity101 have been equally strong in response			0
" this is ' sooo ' blatantly political , " rep. @entity104 , @entity105 of @entity106 , dragging out his comment for emphasis			0
" @entity109 are again playing to the cheap seats with hyperpartisan witch hunts			0
" @entity104 and other @entity101 have raised the charge of @entity113 in the case , arguing that little new information in the @entity8 scandal has come to light in recent months and accusing republicans of using the case to distract from other issues			0
next : @entity10 , @entity1 in court ? as the politics vibrate , wednesday 's contempt vote set off a specific process in the bureaucratic machine			1
now the contempt charge moves to the @entity127 where the @entity129 attorney for @entity130 must decide whether to prosecute her			0
if charges are not pursued , @entity1 @entity2 leaders face another choice : will they file a lawsuit to try and force the @entity127 to take action ? it is certainly possible			1
that is the precise course of events that followed when the @entity1 charged attorney general @entity139 with contempt in 2012 for refusing to turn over documents in the botched " @entity143 " gun - running investigation			2
in that case , @entity139 and the @entity1 asserted executive privilege			0
that has not happened yet in the @entity7 case			0
but @entity2 are clearly teeing up a battle with the attorney general and president @entity6			2
immediately following the @entity7 contempt vote , the @entity1 voted 250 - 168 to call on @entity139 to remove the @entity8 investigation from the @entity127 and instead appoint a special counsel to look into the scandal			1
opinion : one more reason some people hate the @entity8 @entity157 accuses @entity101 counterpart of obstructing @entity8 investigation			0

contempt vote fell almost entirely along party lines in @entity2 - controlled @entity1
former @entity8 official @entity7 has exercised her fifth amendment rights in *testimony*
the vote sets up a possible legal fight between @entity10 and the @entity6 administration
the @entity1 has *aggressively* investigated @entity8 targeting of conservative groups
