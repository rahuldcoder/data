-- @entity2 investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where @entity5 kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years , along with three of their children			1
@entity5 admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children			1
investigators believe @entity14 planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 , shortly after , according to his daughter , he began raping her at age 11 or 12 , said police spokesman @entity16			1
the 73 - year - old @entity2 began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year , and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- @entity16 said			0
it took @entity14 until 1983 to finish the addition , @entity16 said			1
investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison , which was blocked by a 500 - kilogram ( 1,100 - pound ) steel and concrete door that @entity14 probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance , @entity16 said			1
@entity14 , who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar , had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison			1
" you would have to open up a total of eight doors , and ... ( for the ) last door which would go into this space ( where the family was imprisoned ) , you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus , " @entity16 said			2
" we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we have n't discovered yet , and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting			0
" @entity14 was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter , @entity50 , captive in the dungeon under the @entity14 home for decades , repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived			1
three of the children were adopted by @entity5 and his wife after he concocted the ruse that @entity50 had left the babies on their doorstep			1
the story of the family 's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago , when one of the children still in the dungeon , 19 - year - old @entity5 , fell seriously ill with convulsions			1
the father agreed to take her to a hospital , the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers			0
dr. @entity75 , who is treating @entity76 , said monday that while her condition is still " grave , " it " has improved somewhat			2
" " she has become more stable , but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help , " @entity75 said , noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation			2
@entity50 and her two sons were reunited with her mother , @entity86 , who police say knew nothing about the basement prison			2
they were also reunited with the three children that @entity92 had taken from @entity50			0
the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic , where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic 's chief doctor			2
" the mother and the smallest child have , in just the last couple of days , increased their sensitivity to light , " dr. @entity103 said			0
" so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses			0
" five - year - old @entity113 is " getting more and more lively , " @entity103 said			0
" he 's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air , the light , and the food -- all of these things are helping them , " he said			0
" slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal ( shade )			0
" he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family			0
@entity103 praised @entity50 for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity			0
he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family , and the children make their beds			2
however , he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in @entity14 's home			1
he said the mother , @entity50 , takes breaks and naps several times a day			0
the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying , @entity103 said			0
@entity103 said the children , after being confined to a small space their entire lives , are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces			0
initially the dungeon where @entity14 held his daughter was only 35 square meters			1
in 1993 , around the time @entity50 was pregnant with her fourth child , @entity14 decided to add to the dungeon , building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters			1
on wednesday or thursday , prosecution authorities will attempt to question @entity14 -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession , state prosecutor @entity168 said			1
a warden at the @entity173 jail , where @entity14 is being held , told @entity0 that @entity14 appears to be doing well , but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained			2
