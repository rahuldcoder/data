-- even back in the days when you could still use the term " peace process " with a straight face , the odds of solving the @entity3 issue were already pretty long			1
then , i would have put those odds a bit north of impossible and a little south of hopeless			2
things are even worse now			2
i remember day eight of the @entity14 summit in july 2000 , when discussion turned to @entity3			1
that day , it was clear to me that as far @entity14 was concerned , it was game over			2
there were some intriguing moves on @entity22 's part , but nothing that could have settled the issue			2
indeed , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 could have fallen into the yawning gaps that separated @entity22 and @entity29 on this issue and never have been heard from again			2
fast forward a decade and a half , and not much has changed			0
@entity3 is still insoluble and it now seems more explosive then ever			1
so what is it about @entity3 / @entity33 that makes it so potentially contentious and deadly ? three things stand out : it 's a perfect storm of complexity			1
@entity3 is a microcosm of almost all the issues in the @entity22 - @entity29 conflict packed into one small place that is marked by a big history			1
it combines territory ( who will control land in the east and west , not to mention the four quarters -- @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 -- of the old city )			2
it involves political identity ( conflicting claims to the city as a capital ) ; it is driven by religion ( see below ) involving not just @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity58 , but globally , too ; and as the last few months suggest , it is also a matter of security fraught and framed now by an intimacy of killing reflected in the slayings of @entity22 and @entity29 teens this past summer and last week 's savage @entity29 attack on a synagogue in west @entity3			1
@entity68 quipped that proximity breeds children , and contempt , too			0
in this regard , @entity3 is unique in that it is one of the only places where @entity22 and @entity29 ( the vast majority who are n't @entity78 citizens of @entity22 ) mix every day and have almost unrestricted access to one another			1
it is a stunning testament to the pragmatism and self - interest of @entity22 and @entity29 -- as well as the imbalance of power -- that the city has remained as quiet and functional as it has these many years given such passions and politics			1
but it should be no surprise that given those politics and passions that @entity3 has often become a bloody flash point , often but not always a result of the perception among @entity29 that @entity22 is trying to change the status of some aspect of @entity3			1
the reason for this latest round of tensions , violence and bloodletting is a perfect storm of factors that include the sense of isolation and frustration on the part of the @entity29 of @entity3 who do n't have the benefit of the social services and economic advantages of @entity22 in the west ; @entity22 's effort to expand their communities and presence in @entity3 ; @entity118 ' efforts to incite and fan the flames ; and the grim realization that the future seems almost certain to be more of the same			1
with the @entity22 - @entity127 war over until the next round , and the @entity125 relatively quiet , it 's @entity3 that has emerged as the epicenter of unrest			1
things in @entity3 would be bad enough if the perfect storm were driven only by proximity as well as nationalist and political conflict			1
but that was not to be			0
@entity3 is above all a matter of faith , of belief and of religion			1
the notion that the three @entity143 faiths -- @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 -- share common values concerning peace , social justice and humanity may well be true			0
but that has never been the case when it comes to this city			2
history is filled with claims , conquests , crusades , occupations , massacres and violence in the name of possessing @entity3 , not sharing it			1
and nowhere has the religious complexity of the @entity3 issue been clearer than on the question of who controls and what will happen to the @entity169 ( @entity170 ) and @entity169 ( @entity169 )			1
that platform , situated within the walls of @entity3 's @entity173 , is in essence a physical manifestation of overlapping sacred space			1
atop sits the goldened @entity178 , a seventh century @entity144 shrine built by the @entity179 that houses the foundation stone , a massive rock that figures prominently in @entity48 and @entity144 tradition			0
and nearby there 's a site of even greater significance -- the @entity186 started by @entity187 in the seventh century			0
according to the @entity189 , it is reputed to be the ascension point where the @entity191 rose to heaven on his @entity193			0
below the platform are the remains of both @entity48 temples , which housed the @entity197 and the @entity198			0
the area is so sensitive to @entity48 that they were enjoined not to set foot on the @entity169 out of fear that they could be treading on that sacred ground			0
it is quite extraordinary that despite incidents of violence -- october 1990 , september 1996 , september 2000 and of course what 's transpired in recent weeks -- that the area has not been a scene of continuous struggle			0
part of the answer may lie in the fact that the @entity22 government has been the single greatest factor in preventing @entity48 prayer there and in trying to preserve the status quo			0
and if there 's any hope of avoiding a catastrophe , it will depend on a continued effort by the government to make clear that it wo n't tolerate an effort by its own ministers , members of the parliament , and a variety of hard - line groups to do precisely that			0
that , combined with efforts by the @entity232 to cool its own rhetoric and avoid anything that could be interpreted as inciting to violence , will help minimize the chances of a blowup and buy time and space			0
but buy time and space for what ? is there a solution ? keep in mind that the sacred space issue is only one dimension of the @entity3 problem			1
you also have the challenge of what to do with the @entity173 , how to deal with the problem of a city that will be the capitals of two states , and the more mundane but still contentious issues of how to run a city as special and complex as this one			2
in july 2000 , at the @entity14 summit , we did n't come close to resolving any of these issues			0
on the sacred space issue we tried creative ideas , including sovereignty above ground for the @entity29 and below for the @entity22 and ( my favorite ) taking sovereignty away from both and placing it with @entity271			0
no deal , even though we were dealing with @entity22 ( @entity25 ) and @entity29 ( @entity26 ) who were far more willing and able to do something if the terms were right			0
those are not the leaders we have today			0
there were nights in @entity3 after the negotiations had ended that i 'd sit with my friend @entity280 , adviser and @entity283 interpreter to half a dozen presidents			1
we 'd look at the walls of @entity3 and wonder about what the @entity49 leader @entity287 and the @entity51 crusader @entity286 would have made of @entity290 efforts			2
not much , we concluded sadly			0
but we knew what they must have sensed , too			0
history teaches that @entity3 is n't to be shared			1
@entity3 is to be possessed and contested in the name of the tribe , the nation -- and above all in the name of @entity271			2
and whether that past will remain prologue remains to be seen .			0
