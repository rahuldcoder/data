was is a helicopter ? a truck ? a train ? @entity58 was in an office building elevator in @entity60 , alone , when the shaking started			1

" @entity118 , a @entity119 from @entity120 , @entity24 , had no doubt it was a quake , either			2
the question for her was whether it had occurred out in the ocean			0
she said everyone taking in the sun at @entity128 , @entity24 , sprang up at the same time and looked anxiously out to the @entity129			0
" the water did not recede ( a telltale sign of an impending tsunami ) , but i 'm sure that 's what everyone was worried about , " she said			0
