-- the @entity1 is recited in classrooms across the country every morning -- and because of the words " under @entity7 , " it is heard in courtrooms across the country seemingly just as often these days			1
every attempt to eliminate the mention of @entity7 has thus far failed , but the @entity10 will hear arguments on wednesday seeking removal of the two words for a new reason : discrimination			1
" this is the first challenge of its kind " said @entity16 , the executive director of the @entity17 , an atheist group arguing for the plaintiffs			1
" we feel very confident that we have a strong case			1
" that case , which was brought by an unidentified family of a student at a school in suburban @entity28 , will be argued on the premise that the pledge violates the @entity31 of the @entity32			1
it is the first such case to be tried on the state level : all previous attempts have been argued in federal court on the grounds that ' under @entity7 ' was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of church and state			1
" they 're grasping at straws " said @entity40 of the @entity41 , the attorney arguing to leave the pledge as it is			2
" they know they would lose again if they tried it under the @entity50 , so now they are trying a new tack			2
" @entity40 dismissed the discrimination claim because he said everyone has the right to opt out of saying the pledge			0
" this would be very different if they were forced to recite the pledge , " he said			0
but that makes little difference in the eyes of @entity16			0
" the opt - out itself is exclusionary and unpleasant " he said			0
" children are left with a bad choice : either stand up and recite something against your beliefs , or opt out and be ostracized			2
" the @entity10 has previous high - profile and precedent - setting experience deciding cases hinging on the @entity31 of the @entity32			1
in 2003 , @entity71 became the first state to legalize same - sex marriage with the @entity10 's landmark @entity75 decision			1
" i think there is a reason why they chose this court " @entity40 said			0
" but the law is the law , and i think the court will decide that this is not discrimination , but a disagreement			0
" @entity40 said he fears a loss in @entity71 would inspire " copycat " lawsuits in the handful of other states that have similar clauses in their constitutions -- a fear @entity16 certainly did n't assuage			2
" we will absolutely be looking in other states if we should prevail			0
" nationality , identity and the pledge of allegiance			0

phrase " under @entity7 " discriminates against atheist students , lawsuit says
