-- it was with a heavy heart that i heard @entity4 has been granted , and apparently accepted , temporary asylum in @entity6 for one year			1
short of locking him naked in solitary confinement as an example to other leakers , as was done to @entity11 , @entity6 is exactly where the @entity13 intelligence community wants @entity4			1
how better to discredit @entity4 's warnings of the threat posed to civil liberties by our ever - growing surveillance state than to ceaselessly point out that he has found sanctuary in the arms of the @entity22 , the successor to the @entity24 ? i suspect this latest development will nix any possibility of reform of domestic surveillance operations coming out of the @entity29			1
of course , at this point , where else could @entity4 go ? he had spent five weeks in @entity33 's @entity32			1
that had to be a purgatory on earth			2
by leaning on our allies , @entity13 had effectively trapped him there			1
one should not take too seriously , though , the outrage expressed by director of national intelligence @entity43 and @entity45 over this latest @entity6 perfidy			1
by fleeing to @entity13 's traditional bogeyman , @entity4 has seriously blunted his own effectiveness			1
he has become an easy target for the @entity13 government to demonize			1
into whose hands has @entity4 actually put himself ? with nowhere else to go , he is now physically under the control of a government whose leadership under @entity56 has raised human rights alarms worldwide for the alleged killing of dissenting reporters , the jailing of performance artists like @entity62 and -- most recently -- the criminalization of homosexuality			1
@entity56 's thumbing of the nose to the @entity68 administration may be seen as a great thing for @entity4 and his fate , but it 's important to bear in mind that today 's @entity6 is no more a bastion of free speech than @entity75			1
opinion : how @entity56 's move could help @entity4 and @entity13 years ago , i was convicted of espionage , sentenced to 40 years imprisonment , and packed off in chains to a federal penitentiary			1
it was more than i could endure , so one cold winter night i escaped through the razor wire			0
i at once became @entity86 fugitive			0
i was hunted high and low by the @entity87 and the @entity88			0
i was shot at and chased and forever looking over my shoulder			0
i too contemplated seeking sanctuary in @entity6			1
i thought long and hard about it because there was an easy route through @entity94 to @entity33			0
but i could not stomach the thought of it			0
i decided i would rather live the life of a hunted fugitive in my own country than spend my years controlled as a puppet of the @entity24			0
after my arrest in 1977 , i spent 25 years in prison			2
contrary to what many believe , my partner and i did not give information to the @entity106 to aid the @entity107			0
i did what i did because i wanted to publicize and strike back at the @entity13 intelligence community for the things i saw that outraged me			1
it was a mistake that cost me dearly , and one that i lived to regret			0
i suspect @entity4 will come to regret his actions just as deeply			1
this , more than anything else , would be the greatest tragedy of all			0
opinion : what 's in it for @entity6 ? there is no doubt in my mind that @entity4 will rather be anywhere else on earth than in the arms of @entity127			1
of course , there are two exceptions to that statement : he does not want to be dead and he does not want to be sitting naked in an @entity13 solitary confinement cell			2
i do not see that his choices were all that great			0
meanwhile , the @entity13 surveillance state will go on stockpiling the sensitive personal data of the @entity13 people			2
the @entity138 court will continue to function as a secret rubber stamp to spy on our own citizenry			2
the bulk collection of our telephone data will mushroom			0
the addresses of all letters and packages mailed and received will continue to be photographed by the @entity148			2
internet companies will continue to be bent to the secret purposes of the surveillance state			2
the @entity152 will go on recording all our e-mail			0
opinion : @entity4 is an unwanted guest in @entity56 's @entity6 transparency , public disclosure , and open debate will be stifled as @entity13 becomes the world 's first cyber-superpower			1
and politicians of both parties will go on fearing to resist lest they be blamed should a cyber-attack happen			0
our surveillance state is only just beginning to flex its technological muscles			0
we have nothing to lose but our civil liberties			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			2

convicted spy @entity171 : @entity4 is right where @entity13 intelligence wants him to be
@entity171 : @entity6 , with such a poor human rights record , discredits @entity4 's warnings
@entity171 : @entity4 will hate it , but it 's better than his possible *treatment* in a @entity13 prison
meanwhile , the @entity13 government will continue to spy on its citizens *unabated* , he says
