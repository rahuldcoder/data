@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 government said wednesday it will appeal a @entity6 court ruling that certain police stop - and - search powers are a breach of human rights			1
under section 44 of @entity4 's @entity13 , uniformed officers may stop any pedestrian or vehicle and search them , regardless of whether they have reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing			2
human rights groups complain the rules are subject to abuse , but the @entity4 government calls the powers an important tool in the fight against terrorism			1
@entity4 home secretary @entity26 said he was disappointed in tuesday 's ruling by the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , because the appeals had previously gone through the @entity4 courts and been rejected			1
" we are considering the judgment and will seek to appeal , " @entity26 said in a statement			0
" pending the outcome of this appeal , the police will continue to have these powers available to them			1
" @entity0 's @entity40 said that because of sensitivity and concerns about use of the stop - and - search powers , they are only being used at " pre-identified significant locations " like landmarks , tourist sites , and crowded places , or where certain police operations are taking place			2
the case began in september 2003 , when police stopped and searched two @entity4 nationals who were on their way to a @entity0 demonstration			1
@entity56 was on his bicycle and wearing a backpack when police searched him			2
he was allowed to go after about 20 minutes , the court said			0
@entity61 is a journalist who was on her way to cover the demonstration when police stopped and searched her , the court said			1
police ordered her to stop filming even though she showed her press cards ; the official record of her search said she was stopped for about five minutes , though she says she thought it was closer to half an hour			2
@entity56 and @entity69 complained that the police use of the stop - and - search powers under @entity12 breached the @entity72 -- specifically their right to liberty and security , right to respect for private and family life , freedom of expression , and freedom of assembly and association			1
the case reached the @entity82 , @entity4 's highest court , but the @entity82 dismissed the appeal in march 2006 because they said they were n't convinced the police search disrespected the plaintiffs ' private lives			1
even if the search did not respect the plaintiffs ' private lives , the @entity82 found , the procedure was in accordance with the law and was proportionate to counterterrorism efforts			0
@entity56 and @entity69 then appealed to the @entity28 , which heard the case in may and issued its ruling tuesday			1
" it 's fantastic news after a long struggle , " @entity56 said , in a statement issued by the human rights group @entity96 , which took the case to court			1
" i look to the government for a strong response			0
" said @entity69 , in another statement issued by @entity96 , " there has to be a balance between private life and security			0
the court has shown that @entity110 is an invasion of people 's right to liberty and privacy			0
" the court found that the " coercive powers " of the anti-terrorism legislation amounted to a clear interference with the right to respect for private life			1
this interference was compounded by the public nature of the search , because it brings an element of humiliation and embarrassment , the court found			0
legal safeguards were not adequate enough to curb the wide discretion police had to use the powers , the court found			2
it said that wide discretion was a cause for concern			0
" the officer 's decision to stop and search an individual was one based exclusively on the ' hunch ' or ' professional intuition , ' " the court wrote in its decision			0
" not only was it unnecessary for him to demonstrate the existence of any reasonable suspicion ; he was not required even subjectively to suspect anything about the person stopped and searched			2
" because officers have no obligation to show a reasonable suspicion , it is " almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised , " the court said			0
as a result , the court said , the stop - and - search powers were not in accordance with the law			0
@entity96 called on the @entity4 government to ensure that section 44 is only applied when authorities believe it is necessary to prevent terrorism			1
it should be applied to specific areas and for not longer than 24 hours , @entity96 said , which would prevent authorities from applying the measures on a rolling basis and over large parts of a city			0
@entity96 also called on the government to publish notice that authorization for @entity12 has been given .			0

@entity4 will appeal ruling against police searches allowed by its anti-terrorism legislation
@entity28 ruled that searches breached plaintiffs ' human rights
case was brought by two @entity4 who were stopped and searched by police in 2003
@entity4 says the powers are an important tool in the fight against terrorism
