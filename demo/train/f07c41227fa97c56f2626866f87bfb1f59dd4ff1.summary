few question that there was a major chemical attack in @entity3 last week , and the @entity4 has made clear that it blames the government of president @entity6			1
now , the question is how president @entity7 will respond			2
for almost two years , @entity7 has avoided direct military involvement in @entity3 's civil war , only escalating aid to rebel fighters in june after suspected smaller - scale chemical weapons attacks by @entity3 government forces			1
however , last week 's attack on a @entity16 suburb that reportedly killed and wounded more than 3,000 people obliterated the " red line " @entity7 set just over a year ago against the use of @entity3 's chemical weapons stocks			1
at the @entity22 , spokesman @entity21 told reporters monday that @entity7 was evaluating " a response to the clear use on a mass scale with repugnant results of chemical weapons , " adding that " there is very little doubt that the @entity3 regime ... used those weapons			1
" meanwhile , @entity4 secretary of state @entity33 called the attack " inexcusable " and " undeniable , " and said there was " a clear reason that the world has banned entirely chemical weapons			1
" he said that evidence " strongly indicates " chemical weapons were used in @entity3 and that " we know the @entity3 regime maintains custody " of such weapons and has the rockets to use them			1
@entity45 's remarks @entity7 " will be making an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use " of chemical weapons , @entity33 added , saying the president " believes there must be accountability " for those who use them			1
options available to @entity7 range from ordering limited missile strikes to continued diplomatic efforts labeled by critics as a " do - nothing " approach			2
@entity7 will be presented with final options regarding actions against @entity3 in the next few days , a senior administration official said monday			1
assuming the president decides to go ahead with a military response , any action could come as early as mid-week , though it could be later , the official cautioned			0
factors weighing into the timing of any action include a desire to get it done before the president leaves for @entity73 next week and before the administration has to make a decision on whether to suspend aid to @entity77 because of the ongoing political turmoil there , the official explained			0
the administration also wants it to be a quick response to the use of chemical weapons , the senior administration official said			2
@entity4 officials are consulting with allies to ensure they are supportive of any @entity4 action , which the senior administration official said would be very limited in scope and a direct reaction to the use of chemical weapons			1
and three representatives of allied governments involved in those top - level consultations said the goal is to reach a consensus as soon as possible			0
" no one is talking about a long process , " one @entity97 diplomat told @entity98			0
@entity101 , a @entity102 spokeswoman , said any @entity4 response would be " a determination on how to respond to a blatant use of chemical weapons , and it 's not necessarily to change the entire situation on the ground in @entity3			1
" that might be a mistake , said @entity111 , an analyst at the @entity113 's @entity112			0
a @entity4 strike " ca n't just be one and done , " but should be part of a plan to remove @entity6 , he told @entity98 's " @entity118 360			1
" " the president has been very reulctant to get involved			0
public opinion has been against it			0
there 's not a lot of support on @entity125 , " @entity111 said			0
" and yet , here we are again			0
time and time again , we get dragged further and further in			0
" the result could be " a @entity129 - type problem , where we kind of back our way into this , if we do n't come up with a plan about how to win			0
" @entity33 spoke with his @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity137 counterparts monday and with the secretary - general of the @entity139 , @entity101 said			0
" obviously , the intelligence assessment is ongoing , " she said			0
" but he reiterated that the president is studying the facts and will be making an informed decision about how to respond going forward			0
" the @entity7 administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the @entity3 regime was responsible for last week 's chemical weapons attack , another senior administration official said			1
the declassification would happen before any @entity4 military action would take place			2
a senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told @entity98 that the evidence " includes but is not limited to " satellite images of activity at @entity3 military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots			1
earlier monday , a @entity22 official ruled out sending ground troops to @entity3 or implementing a no - fly zone to blunt @entity6 's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime			2
the official insisted that all other options were under consideration by @entity7 but put no time frame on a decision			1
meanwhile , a senior @entity173 official told @entity98 's @entity174 monday that four @entity178 destroyers " maintain readiness and , if required , could execute a mission within hours " of being ordered to do so			0
but the official added that the @entity4 military remained " in a holding pattern " as @entity7 considers both military and nonmilitary options			1
opinion : how @entity185 used chemical weapons to poison debate on @entity3 also , defense secretary @entity188 said while visiting @entity189 that any @entity4 action " will be in concert with the international community and within the framework of legal justification			1
" while @entity196 @entity195 ban ki - moon said monday that the use of chemical weapons was a crime against humanity and must be punished , certain opposition by @entity3 ally @entity73 and possibly @entity202 undermined the possibility that the @entity204 would support a military mission			2
instead , a limited coalition of @entity208 partners such as @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity133 -- all of which have called for action against @entity3 -- and some @entity139 members appeared more likely to provide the political backing needed by @entity7 to order @entity4 missile strikes			1
a senior administration official told @entity98 on monday that the goals of any coalition military action would be to punish @entity6 and show him that there was a cost for using chemical weapons while preventing him from doing so again			2
in addition , a military strike would seek to degrade the @entity3 regime 's capabilities enough to weaken it without causing it to fall to an opposition considered unprepared to assume power , the official said			1
possible coalition partners include @entity208 allies @entity133 , @entity210 , @entity209 and @entity232 , as well as regional powers @entity135 , @entity234 , @entity137 and the @entity235			0
last month , @entity237 chairman gen. @entity236 provided @entity238 with a list of declassified @entity4 military options for @entity3 that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to " an act of war " at a time of deep budget cuts			1
@entity4 official : almost no doubt @entity6 regime used chemical weapons @entity236 's letter , dated july 19 , listed @entity4 assets in the region including @entity257 missile defense batteries in @entity234 and @entity134 , as well as f - 16 jet fighters positioned to defend @entity134 from possible cross-border trouble			1
in addition , the @entity173 has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region			0
according to @entity4 officials , updated options offered the president in recent days included : â € ¢ @entity267 missiles fired from one of four @entity178 destroyers deployed in the @entity270			1
the missiles would be used to strike " command and control " facilities such as command bunkers , or the @entity3 regime 's means of delivering chemical weapons : artillery batteries and launchers			1
there is no indication that the missiles would strike at actual chemical weapons stockpiles			2
â € ¢ military jets firings weapons from outside @entity3 airspace			2
this option carries additional risks and is considered less likely			0
" they have to be careful to do this in concert with our allies , " @entity288 rep. @entity287 of @entity289 , a member of the @entity290 , told @entity98 on sunday , adding that " i do n't think the @entity22 is going to want to risk @entity4 lives by sending pilots over @entity3 , so that really limits our options to cruise strikes and think that 's probably where the @entity22 is going to go			1
" @entity196 chemical weapons inspectors reach alleged attack site cruise missile strikes could be " very punishing " on @entity6 's missile supplies and aircraft without going after the chemical weapons stockpiles to risk dispersing them , @entity287 said			0
to @entity310 , a vice president at the @entity311 , the situation is forcing @entity7 to shift from being an " avoider - in - chief " regarding military involvement in @entity3			2
" it 's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action , " @entity310 told @entity314 in an interview broadcast monday			0
he said he expected a significant response that amounts to " a warning that lays down this time a red line that the president intends to enforce , not one that turns pink			0
" " it can not simply be a couple of cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere , " @entity310 said , adding that the goal was to deter @entity6 rather than topple him or radically shift the balance in @entity3 at this time			0
" the president 's not on the verge of becoming the cavalry to rescue the country			0
" @entity287 agreed that @entity7 has little choice but to respond strongly			2
" in terms of the credibility of the @entity22 , " he said , " the cost of not acting now , i think , exceeds the cost of acting			0

official : @entity7 could be presented with options within days
