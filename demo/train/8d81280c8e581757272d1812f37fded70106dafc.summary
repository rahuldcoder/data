-- @entity1 is both a place and a metaphor			1
the place is a @entity5 @entity4 in the @entity7 @entity6 where two indigenous communities , the @entity9 and the @entity10 , live in voluntary isolation			0
below the biosphere lie the oil fields @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , abbreviated to @entity17			2
yasuní the metaphor is the initiative for paying to keep that oil underground and leave the biological and cultural diversity undisturbed			1
upon learning of just these bare - bone facts , i realized that i have been thinking about the economics of the @entity1 for most of my professional career , long before i knew where @entity1 is and what it would mean for humanity			1
in march 2009 i signed a contract with the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) to work out the economics of the @entity1			1
three questions loomed large in the global context of climate change			1
why should the international community pay anyone for essentially doing nothing ? what should they pay ? how would they pay it ? before answering , i wrestled with the language			2
because everything changes , i preferred " climate fluctuations " and " transformation " to " climate change			1
" similarly , " sink " is a more precise term than " atmosphere " for describing the destination of carbon dioxide			0
synthesizing the physics with the economics , i wrote " the @entity55 of the @entity56 : climate change as if @entity57 "			1
in economics , the sink is also a commons , and climate transformation becomes a question of scale			1
any one country can pursue a dirty industrialization without much worry ; but when all countries do so , a " tragedy of the commons " ensues			2
alarmingly , emissions have risen significantly since 1990 when the @entity73 issued its first assessment report			0
in some countries , such as @entity77 and @entity78 , they have skyrocketed			2
this is not a criticism of @entity77 or @entity78			0
no wealthy country ever became wealthy without a dirty industrialization			0
" @entity87 " is the reason why the developed countries should pay the developing ones not to exploit their carbon			1
@entity88 is a pilot project			2
what should the developed countries pay ? the @entity7 government quotes $ 3.5 billion as half the value of the oil foregone in the @entity17 fields			1
as an economist , i cringe			0
if i or any other economist knew the future price of oil , we would probably be enjoying early retirement in the @entity102			2
knowing how to speculate is what made @entity104 a multi-billionaire			0
in contrast , the value of the investment and operations foregone is known : @entity109 estimates them at approximately $ 5 billion			0
my recommendation is that @entity88 seek $ 1.25 billion per year in compensation for the first four years of the @entity1 and thereafter , the value of the carbon dioxide avoided			1
how much is that worth ? ( again the @entity102 beckons )			0
if the short history of the carbon market is any guide , the payments would be somewhere between $ 300 million and $ 900 million per year			0
the financial flows would stop when @entity88 achieves the @entity122 that @entity123 held in 2002 , the year its government declined offshore oil extraction without any monetary inducement			1
finally , the last and touchiest question remains : how should the developed countries pay ? the theoretical answer is sponsorship of projects selected according to economic criteria			1
topping the list would be the requirement that projects be both public in nature and incapable of being funded from an existing source			0
the practical side to how countries should pay is also a question about mechanism			2
its answer appeared on august 3 , 2010			0
at midday in the elegant ballroom of the @entity143 of @entity88 , under - secretary - general of the @entity31 @entity144 and foreign minister of ecuador @entity145 signed an historic agreement that launched the @entity148			1
that evening i launched with far less fanfare " the @entity55 "			0
ms. @entity144 introduced me to an audience gathered at the @entity31 offices			2
she commented to much laughter that after such a heady day , we were all fully " yasunized "			0
yasuní the place and yasuní the metaphor have now morphed into a verb .			0

@entity1 is a *protected* area of forest in @entity88 rich in *biodiversity* and natural *resources*
new @entity31 initiative will see rich countries pay to keep oil *reserves* in the ground
@entity169 has studied the area and economics of climate change
