-- there is nothing new under the sun , the saying goes , and it could not be more true than with the recycled literature of the popular " mommy porn " trilogy " @entity7			1
" just this week , @entity8 acquired the movie rights to the bodice ripper for reportedly more than $ 5 million as traditional publisher @entity12 / @entity11 promises to turn the book , which has been sold mainly as an e-book , into a paperback version with a 750,000 copy print release next month			0
however hot the property appears , the plot and devices are centuries old , leading us to wonder whether the commercial success signals a breakthrough in women 's sexual freedom or a new low in women 's debasement			1
the novel tells the story of @entity7 , who finishes college by losing her virginity to billionaire @entity7 , becoming his " submissive " in a sadomasochistic relationship			1
the e-book version of the trilogy has gone viral with mature women readers , even as critics have denounced the book 's reactionary gender politics			1
neither extreme explains the novel 's compelling relevance			2
though no literary masterpiece , " @entity7 " is more than parasitic fan fiction based on the recent " @entity46 " vampire series			1
its abundant references to classic literature unlock a subtler commentary on enduring obstacles to women 's individual freedom and rights			1
whenever power relations are unequal , the novel implies , sexual consent is never black and white : it is always fifty shades of gray			2
paying attention to its literary signposts shows what has changed for women in that regard and what has not			1
when " @entity7 " begins , the heroine 's favorite pastime is to curl up with a good book , not a whip			1
after the hero asks her to sign a contract defining her role as his submissive , she tells the reader , " [ @entity77 's ] @entity76 would be outraged , [ @entity79 's ] @entity78 too frightened and [ @entity81 's ] @entity80 would succumb , just as i have			0
" insistent references like this remind us that " @entity7 " is recycling the classic novel plot about a vulnerable young woman and a brooding older man			1
the hero has the lion 's share of socioeconomic power ; the heroine has only her magnetic strength and intelligence			0
news : erotic book surges up best seller list the classic plot promises that by steeling her virginity and holding out for marriage , women can achieve intellectual equality and love			1
those who fail come to bad ends , but the victorious novel heroine learns the hero 's secrets and gains ownership of his heart and true self			0
this last is exactly the fantasy that " @entity7 " sells			1
there is nothing new either about this plot 's association with pornographic whips and chains			2
alongside the genre of the novel , the 18th century saw the emergence of modern pornography , from @entity126 's " @entity125 , " to works by the @entity123 , whom @entity7 imitates as a confessed " sadist			1
" gothic horror novels , which specialized in sadomasochistic innuendo and supernatural phenomena , were also sensationally popular			0
the whip and the vampire emerged in tandem with the marriage plot and chick lit. @entity135 gives @entity136 an app for all the 18th - and 19th - century novels in the @entity139 , but he also presents her a $ 14,000 first edition of @entity81 's " @entity80			2
" the still - disputed question @entity80 poses concerns whether the heroine is raped or seduced			0
though @entity7 is never raped , her individual agency is equally ambiguous			2
she refuses to sign @entity135 's contract , but she lets him spank , whip , chain and blindfold her for the remainder of the trilogy			0
when the debasement gets too extreme , she walks away ( like @entity78 upon discovering @entity154 's bigamy )			2
yet she returns , echoing @entity80 : " the physical pain you inflicted was not as bad as the pain of losing you			0
" throughout , her self - punishing " subconscious " drives her away from @entity135 , while her libidinous " inner goddess " makes her dread losing him			0
if she does n't submit , she will have only her books			0
in exchange for her masochistic submission , @entity136 receives an infinite array of explosive orgasms and @entity135 's love and protection			0
@entity135 always uses a condom , never uses porn and always puts her pleasure first			0
he loves , cherishes , provides and above all uses his power to protect @entity136 -- all while gradually opening up to her , making himself psychologically vulnerable			0
spoiler alert : it turns out that he is a sadist because he was once victimized by older women			2
lest you think women are unequal , the novel emphasizes the hero 's ultimate powerlessness			2
no wonder female readers are falling for this story			0
when the story was first popularized in the 18th century , women had virtually no individual rights			0
they could not vote , could rarely own property and were themselves seen as property -- so much so that if a wife had an extramarital affair , a husband could sue her lover for damages			0
though many things have changed , women remain economically disadvantaged , are far more likely to be violated than titillated by the porn industry and are publicly called " sluts " for demanding insurance coverage for birth control			1
the enduring appeal of a plot like that of " @entity7 " suggests that even in 2012 , most women can not imagine how such inequality might disappear			1
instead they clamor for the delusion that submission to men 's greater power means being taken care of by them			0
of course , pornography can be seductive , and " @entity7 " is hot			2
less enjoyable is the undercurrent about women 's lack of rights			1
@entity219 tells @entity136 , " you need to free your mind and listen to your body			0
" but to what extent can women enjoy free play in a country where those going by the name of " @entity135 " mount legislation forcing them to bear children conceived in rape ? when poor young women like @entity219 's " crack whore " mother are denied access to birth control ? by enjoying a porn of their own , women can at least indulge the fantasy that their pleasure comes first even as politicians are devising new forms of punishment			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of april @entity247 and @entity248 .			1

april @entity247 and @entity250 say " mommy porn " novel a big hit
they ask : is " @entity7 " about women 's sexual freedom or their debasement ?
they say plot device is centuries old : older man dominates younger woman
*writers* : times have changed , but political *rhetoric* , social norms still not good for women
