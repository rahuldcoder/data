-- when does learning begin ? as i explain in the talk i gave at @entity5 , learning starts much earlier than many of us would have imagined : in the womb			1
i was surprised as anyone when i first encountered this notion			2
i 'm a science writer , and my job is to trawl the murky depths of the academic journals , looking for something shiny and new -- a sparkling idea that catches my eye in the gloom			0
starting a few years ago , i began noticing a dazzling array of findings clustered around the prenatal period			0
these discoveries were generating considerable excitement among scientists , even as they overturned settled beliefs about when we start absorbing and responding to information from our environment			0
as a science reporter -- and as a mother -- i had to find out more			0
this research , i discovered , is part of a burgeoning field known as " fetal origins , " and it 's turning pregnancy into something it has never been before : a scientific frontier			1
@entity38 was once a sleepy medical specialty , and research on pregnancy a scientific backwater			1
now the nine months of gestation are the focus of intense interest and excitement , the subject of an exploding number of journal articles , books , and conferences			0
what it all adds up to is this : much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life -- the air she breathes , the food and drink she consumes , the chemicals she 's exposed to , even the emotions she feels -- are shared in some fashion with her fetus			1
they make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself			0
the fetus treats these maternal contributions as information , as what i like to call biological postcards from the world outside			1
by attending to such messages , the fetus learns the answers to questions critical to its survival : will it be born into a world of abundance , or scarcity ? will it be safe and protected , or will it face constant dangers and threats ? will it live a long , fruitful life , or a short , harried one ? the pregnant woman 's diet and stress level , in particular , provide important clues to prevailing conditions , a finger lifted to the wind			1
the resulting tuning and tweaking of the fetus 's brain and other organs are part of what give humans their enormous flexibility , their ability to thrive in environments as varied as the snow - swept tundra in @entity114 and the golden - grassed savanna in @entity116			1
the recognition that learning actually begins before birth leads us to a striking new conception of the fetus , the pregnant woman and the relationship between them			1
the fetus , we now know , is not an inert blob , but an active and dynamic creature , responding and adapting as it readies itself for life in the particular world it will soon enter			1
the pregnant woman is neither a passive incubator nor a source of always - imminent harm to her fetus , but a powerful and often positive influence on her child even before it 's born			2
and pregnancy is not a nine - month wait for the big event of birth , but a crucial period unto itself -- " a staging period for well - being and disease in later life , " as one scientist puts it			2
this crucial period has become a promising new target for prevention , raising hopes of conquering public health scourges like obesity and heart disease by intervening before birth			0
by " teaching " fetuses the appropriate lessons while they 're still in utero , we could potentially end vicious cycles of poverty , infirmity and illness and initiate virtuous cycles of health , strength and stability			0
so how can pregnant women communicate to their fetuses what they need to know ? eat fish , scientists suggest , but make sure it 's the low - mercury kind -- the omega - three fatty acids in seafood are associated with higher verbal intelligence and better social skills in school - age children			2
exercise : research suggests that fetuses benefit from their mothers ' physical activity			0
protect yourself from toxins and pollutants , which are linked to birth defects and lowered @entity186			0
do n't worry too much about stress : research shows that moderate stress during pregnancy is associated with accelerated infant brain development			1
seek help if you think you might be suffering from depression : the babies of depressed women are more likely to be born early and at low birth weight , and may be more irritable and have more trouble sleeping			0
and -- my favorite advice -- eat chocolate : it 's associated with a lower risk of the high blood pressure condition known as preeclampsia			2
when we hold our babies for the first time , we imagine them clean and new , unmarked by life , when in fact they have already been shaped by the world , and by us			0
it 's my privilege to share with the @entity5 audience the good news about how we can teach our children well from the very beginning			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

learning begins in the womb , says @entity216
pregnancy is becoming a scientific frontier , in a field known as " fetal origins , " she says
eating fish , exercising , even eating chocolate are all good for the fetus , says @entity230
moderate stress during pregnancy is good for infant brain development , she says
