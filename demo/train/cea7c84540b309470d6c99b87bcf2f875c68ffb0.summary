@entity0 -- for @entity0 , @entity2 could come early			2
or it could not come at all			2
the deal to end the government shutdown in october included a new deadline -- come up with a plan to fund the government by december 13 -- or risk another partial government shutdown next month			2
well , december 13 is friday and @entity11 and @entity12 negotiators do n't yet have a deal			1
and that 's not the only thing @entity16 has to work on before the @entity11 is supposed to leave town , also on friday , and the @entity12 at the end of next week			1
the budget the talks , led by @entity22 @entity21 rep. @entity21 and @entity0 @entity24 sen. @entity23 , are working to formulate a spending bill for the remainder of fiscal 2014 , which ends next september 30			1
current funding for the government runs out in mid-january around the same time as billions in new automatic spending cuts -- known as sequestration -- are set to hit			1
insisting that negotiators reach a deal , house speaker @entity31 said last week that he " told everybody in the room ( the @entity21 caucus ) we are done at 11 a.m. on december 13			1
" sen. @entity38 , @entity39 , who sits on the @entity11 and @entity12 negotiating panel , said sunday on @entity42 's " @entity41 " that he 's " hopeful " a deal would be reached by the end of this week			2
unemployment benefits an estimated 1.3 million long - term unemployed will be cut from federal jobless benefits by the end of the year			1
another 850,000 could fall off the rolls within the first three months of 2014 , according to the @entity48			1
that 's unless @entity16 extends , for the 12th time since 2008 , the federally funded @entity52 program			1
it provides benefits once a jobless worker 's state benefits expire			2
a ' do - nothing ' @entity16 ? the unemployment extension could be included in budget talks , adding another challenge that @entity21 and @entity60 have to overcome			1
while the second - ranking @entity62 in the @entity12 said he hopes extended unemployment benefits are included , he noted on sunday that such a step wo n't necessarily be a sticking point for his party in budget negotiations			1
" no , i do n't think we 've reached that point where we 've said , ' this is it -- take it or leave it , ' " sen. @entity68 , @entity69 , said on " @entity41 " when asked if his party would demand it be included budget talks			1
while many democrats want an extension , @entity21 are opposed			2
@entity75 @entity21 sen. @entity21 said an extension of jobs benefits harms the unemployed			2
" i do support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they 're paid for			2
if you extend it beyond that , you do a disservice to these workers , " he said on " @entity79			0
" @entity85 the @entity85 , which sets national food policy , is two years overdue			0
@entity16 has been passing short - term extensions instead of the usual five - year plan , but key negotiators now say a short - term fix is not an option			1
@entity0 gridlock risks $ 7 milk if lawmakers fail to pass a @entity85 , the economic impact for ordinary @entity96 could be quite severe			1
the price of milk would more than double to an estimated $ 7 per gallon as government subsidies expire			1
the cost of food overall would go up , with supports for commodities , such as corn and wheat , also running out			0
another huge factor : food stamps			0
the @entity85 authorizes spending for that program as well			0
@entity11 @entity21 want to drop 3.8 million people from those rolls next year -- about 8 % of recipients - while @entity60 are n't keen on those cuts			1
but they would likely have to agree to some reductions for a deal to be reached			0
food stamp spending is currently some 47.6 million people , or nearly 15 % of the population , get food stamps , according to september federal data			0
in 2007 , only 26.3 million , or 8.7 % of the population , received them			0
the ' @entity122 ' for doctors , the holidays are a stressful time if they see @entity127 patients			1
that 's because their reimbursements are caught up in political wrangling and budget negotiations			1
it 's called the " doc fix " and they would see a 24 % reduction in their reimbursements if @entity16 fails to act			1
while there is bipartisan support for doctors to receive payments in full , there is plenty of disagreement between the two parties on how to pay for the costly program			2
@entity0 could still screw up your holidays the latest estimate from the nonpartisan @entity150 found the " doc fix " would cost $ 138 billion over the next decade			0
while that 's far lower than the $ 316 billion the @entity150 projected the previous year , it 's still hard to find that much money lying around			2
the @entity11 announced a path forward but the @entity12 has not			0
it 's unclear how this issue will be resolved			0
if @entity16 fails to fully reimburse them , doctors have threatened to stop seeing @entity127 patients			1
that 's not a viable option as more and more baby boomers sign up for @entity127 every day			1
@entity163 sanctions despite administration objections , members of @entity16 are working to pass new sanctions on @entity163			1
the @entity11 is opposed , saying they would undermine an interim deal with @entity163 meant to halt its nuclear program			0
a @entity12 source familiar with the discussions told @entity1 @entity172 producer @entity171 that senior senators from both parties are nearing agreement on a plan that would prohibit @entity163 from enriching any uranium			0
one source said " the ( @entity185 ) administration 's preference is for us to do nothing , " while another said " they 're fighting us tooth and nail			0
" @entity187 sees hope of progress for @entity163 , @entity190 even if a deal is reached , it 's not clear that @entity12 majority leader @entity193 would defy president @entity185 and bring the package to a vote			0
presidential nominations the @entity12 is back in town for the first time since it changed the rules to allow a simple majority to confirm @entity202 nominations instead of the previous 60 - vote threshold			0
they are expected to clear a backlog of appointments			0
the first vote is expected on @entity208 to the @entity209			0
other nominees likely to come up for a vote before the end of the year include @entity213 and @entity214 , also for the @entity0 court , @entity216 to head the @entity217 , @entity218 to be secretary of the @entity220 and @entity24 rep. @entity221 of @entity222 to run the @entity223			2
defense bill senators also will return to legislation that sets policy goals and spending targets for the military			0
the @entity231 measure has passed the @entity11 but is moving slow in the @entity12 because of the numerous amendments that receive a vote -- common procedure for that legislation			0
while the @entity12 is scheduled to be in town for two weeks , it must hurry since the @entity11 is set to leave on friday			0
@entity1 's @entity171 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity241 's @entity240 contributed to this report			0

@entity16 has made a habit of working until the last minute to meet fiscal deadlines
this year , *congressional* negotiators are working on a budget for 2014
if @entity16 fails to act , the price of milk could spike
doctors face cuts to reimbursements for seeing @entity127 patients
