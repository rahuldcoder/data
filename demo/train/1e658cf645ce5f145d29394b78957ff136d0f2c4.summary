-- after watching @entity3 ' bizarre behavior on " @entity4 " for months , we finally know the reason the reality tv star was acting strangely , and why she checked into rehab in early december			1
in @entity9 's exclusive sneak peek at the " housewives " three - part reunion , @entity3 admits to " @entity12 " host @entity13 : " i 'm an alcoholic			1
" it 's not so much of a surprise to " housewives " fans who watched @entity3 's sister @entity18 accuse her of that very fact way back in season 1			1
but the scene from the reunion is shocking for a different reason : this is the most poised we 've seen @entity3 since season 2 began			2
it 's been a long time since we 've seen @entity3 calm , in control , and subdued -- here 's hoping rehab helped the troubled reality star			1
now , if only the other " housewives " cast members could be as poised			0
that 's right -- it looks like we 're in for another doozy of a @entity4 reunion , folks			2
we have @entity18 referring to herself as the c - word , @entity39 presumably talking about @entity43 's desire to sleep with her husband , and @entity18 seemingly calling another cast member " @entity46			0
" ( probably because she never got her money back for this			0
) and , of course , we can expect plenty of talk about @entity4 following his suicide : @entity13 even asks @entity53 if she ever considered whether or not he was murdered			1
" @entity4 " reunion airs january 30 , february 6 , and february 13			2
