@entity0 , the middleweight boxing contender who spent 19 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of a triple murder , has died in @entity3 , according to @entity4 , the director of client services for the @entity5			1
@entity0 , 76 , died of complications from prostate cancer , @entity4 said			1
" i always remember spending hours and hours with @entity0 talking about the wrongful convictions , " she told @entity9			1
" he was a great mentor and teacher			0
i felt very fortunate to have those times with him			0
... he lived a very full life			2
" @entity0 spent 19 years in prison for a triple killing in @entity20 before a federal judge ruled in 1985 that he and @entity22 , who was with @entity0 on the night of the shootings , did not receive fair trials and released them			1
@entity22 was with @entity0 when he died early sunday morning , @entity4 said , adding that @entity0 had lived in @entity3 since his release from prison			1
@entity0 told @entity9 three years ago that prison allowed him to do two things : shed the illusions and anger that spurred his youthful delinquency , and come to the realization that his destiny might lie in fighting for justice			1
he was a title - seeking prizefighter no more			0
but first , he had to scrap his way out of prison			0
" hatred and bitterness and anger only consume the vessel that contains them			0
it does n't hurt another soul , " @entity0 told @entity9			1
" if i were to allow myself to continue to feel that anger and the bitterness of being a victim , i would have never survived prison itself			0
prison can deal with anger ; prison can deal with hatred because prison is about all those things			0
so i had to overcome those things			0
" @entity0 became an activist for the wrongly convicted after his release and was the first executive director of the @entity5 from 1993 to 2004			1
" @entity0 will be remembered by those at @entity5 who were fortunate enough to have worked with him as a truly courageous man who fought tirelessly to free others who had suffered the same fate as he , " the group said in a statement			1
" we will continue to fight against wrongful convictions , a battle that @entity0 valiantly fought until the day he died			1
rest in peace @entity0 , your battle is over but you will never be forgotten			1
" there was a time when boxing enthusiasts were giddy about @entity0 's future			2
he was fast and powerful , hence his sobriquet , and despite being short for his weight class ( 5 - foot - 8 ) , he became a @entity71 and television fixture			0
ring magazine declared him one of the top middleweight contenders in 1963 after he knocked out 11 of his first 15 professional opponents			0
" his shaven head , prominent mustache , unwavering stare and solid frame made him an intimidating presence in the ring decades before such a look became commonplace , " according to the @entity20 @entity83			0
following a loss in his only title bout in 1964 , @entity0 precipitously fell from grace , losing seven of his 15 final matches before being fingered in a 1966 triple homicide at the @entity90			2
he was convicted and sentenced to three life terms the following year			0
the ruling was later overturned , but @entity0 was convicted again in 1976 , a year after @entity93 co-wrote a song declaring his innocence			2
that conviction , too , was tossed out , and @entity0 walked out of prison in 1985			1
in 1988 , a @entity99 prosecutor filed a motion to dismiss the charges			0
by that time , @entity0 was a cause celebre			2
in addition to the @entity93 tune , his case had drawn the attention of a heavyweight counterpart , @entity108 , and actor @entity109 , among others			0
his plight has also inspired at least a half dozen books , including his own autobiography , written from prison			0
a major motion picture that opened years after @entity0 's release would earn actor @entity117 his fourth @entity119 nomination			1
" @entity120 bless @entity0 and his tireless fight to ensure justice for all , " @entity117 said sunday			1
the 1999 film played a key role in introducing @entity0 to an audience that had not followed his two - decade legal saga , but the ex-boxer said @entity130 , in a way , also introduced him to himself			2
in his 2011 book , " @entity132 : my path from @entity140 to @entity141 , " @entity0 explained that he was not perfect and conceded guilt to a host of regrettable crimes including assaults and robberies -- but not murder			1
those crimes , he said , were perpetrated when he was blind , operating unconsciously -- a recurring theme in his book -- and they were the product of the anger to which he succumbed growing up under @entity148 , he said			2
people we 've lost in 2014			0
