@entity0 , @entity1 -- is it time for underwater search vehicles to start scanning the ocean floor in the hunt for @entity7 ? some analysts say it is , because it 's been days since anyone has picked up a possible signal from the missing aircraft 's data recorders			1
and the batteries powering the locator beacons inside the so - called black boxes are probably dead , a top official from the company that manufactures the beacons told @entity2 on sunday			1
that means searchers may not be able to detect any more pings to help lead them to those pieces of the missing plane			0
meanwhile , the search area for @entity7 grew over the weekend			1
and authorities say no one onboard the plane has been ruled out in connection with its disappearance			0
sound familiar ? do n't worry , it 's not just you			2
more than five weeks into the search for the missing plane , in some ways , investigators seem to be back at square one , or at the very least , nowhere near solving the mystery			2
so should investigators stop listening for pings and start using new tools to scan the bottom of the ocean ? that 's the logical next step , analysts told @entity2			1
and some argue that it 's time to take it			1
" every good effort has been expended , but it 's now looking like the batteries are failing , and it 's time to start mowing the lawn , as we say , time to start scanning the sea floor , " said @entity50 , a @entity2 analyst and ocean search specialist			1
others said it 's worth the time to keep listening for pings -- just in case			1
" any more information that they can glean over the next couple days could save weeks in the other phase of the search			2
a little investment now may save a lot of time later , " said @entity66 , a retired @entity67 oceanographer			2
any data authorities can get to help narrow the search zone could have a major impact , he said			2
on sunday , investigators increased the search area			1
is that a bad sign ? not necessarily , said @entity77 , a @entity2 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity80 @entity79			0
" what i think they 're doing is giving one last final push , a last - ditch effort if you will , to see if by any chance there is any wreckage to be found , " she said			2
" because even a few pieces would help narrow the search			2
i think it 's one last big push			2
maybe just a @entity93 pass to try and find anything that they can to help them zero in on where to go on the ocean floor			0
" the search area has shifted each day as officials look at new data and study the ocean currents			1
still , no debris has been found , and promising audio signals heard days ago were far apart			0
on monday , 12 aircraft and 15 ships were set to participate in the search for the missing plane in an 18,400 - square - mile ( 47,600 - square - kilomter ) area			1
that swath of the @entity111 is smaller than the area crews searched on sunday , but larger than the areas searchers focused on at the end of last week			1
searchers are still listening for the sound of underwater pings , @entity120 's @entity119 said , even though no sounds have been picked up in the past 24 hours			1
batteries ' most likely ' dead the plane carrying 239 people vanished from radar screens early march 8 during a flight from @entity0 to @entity127			0
the batteries that power the beacons attached to @entity7 's black boxes are " most likely " dead or almost depleted , an official with the company that designs and builds the pingers told @entity2 on sunday			1
" more than likely they are reaching end of life or already have			0
we 're at day 37			0
... if ( a beacon ) is still going , it is very , very quiet at this point , " @entity138 told @entity2 's " @entity142			0
" @entity138 , director of engineering for @entity143 , said his company has been helping search officials interpret the data from recent audio signals in the southern @entity111 , where the plane is thought to have been when it reached the end of its fuel supply			0
the signals were definitely man - made , he said , but there is no way to be 100 % sure they came from the flight data recorder in the tail of the plane or the cockpit voice recorder until wreckage or the so - called black boxes are found on the ocean floor			1
the batteries that send out the signals were certified to last 30 days , a deadline that 's already passed			2
" we are in a transition period at the moment , " retired lt. col. @entity164 of the @entity165 told @entity2 , referring to the fact that searchers will soon have to give up hunting with pinger locators and switch to sonar			0
" we know that the ( data recorder ) batteries last between 30 and 40 days			0
" once searchers conclude there is no hope that the batteries could still power the beacons , they will lower the @entity180 - 21 , an unmanned underwater vehicle that uses sonar to scour the ocean floor , @entity184			0
black boxes are vital to determine cause a top @entity1 official on sunday reaffirmed the importance of finding the black boxes from the @entity191 if the mystery of the missing airliner is ultimately to be solved			1
for instance , it would be difficult for investigators to clear crew or passengers until the two recorders are located , @entity1 's acting transport minister , @entity194 , said at a news conference in @entity0			1
the inspector general of police has found nothing suspicious about the passenger manifest , @entity194 said , but " he did not say that they all had been cleared on the four issues that the police are still investigating , which is the possible hijacking , issues of terrorism , psychological and personal problems			0
" that is an ongoing thing , and i do n't think the @entity213 would have meant that they have all been cleared , because unless we find more information , specifically on data in the black box , i do n't think any chief of police would be in the position " to declare the cases cleared , he said			0
odd paths pings can take underwater living in limbo four pings , one dud on april 5 , the towed pinger locator detected two sets of underwater pulses of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons			0
three days later , on tuesday , it reacquired the signals twice			0
all four signals were within 17 miles of one another			0
a fifth ping , detected thursday by a sonobuoy dropped from an airplane , is " unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes , " @entity120 chief search coordinator @entity237 said a day later			1
how deep is deep ? imagining the @entity7 search underwater the hunt for a flight 370 ping : how they are doing it @entity2 's @entity247 reported from @entity0 and @entity248 and @entity249 wrote from @entity250			1
