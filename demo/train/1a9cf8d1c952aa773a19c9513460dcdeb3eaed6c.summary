-- @entity1 slammed the @entity2 thursday for what it said was an " unacceptable " humanitarian response to the crisis in the @entity6			1
in an open letter , the group , also known as @entity1 , said it had " deep concern " over the @entity2 ' humanitarian agencies ' " appalling performance " in the country over the past year			1
this failure , it said , has left tens of thousands of vulnerable people without the help they need			1
violence has plagued the @entity6 since a coalition of rebels deposed president @entity21 in march , the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence			1
the past week has seen a surge in fighting in the capital , @entity29 , and in the town of @entity31 , 185 miles north , where many of those displaced by months of conflict between @entity34 and @entity36 militias have sought refuge in camps			0
@entity40 troops have now been deployed alongside @entity42 forces in a peacekeeping mission aimed at restoring security , protecting civilians and ensuring access to humanitarian aid			0
the @entity1 letter , addressed to @entity49 , the @entity2 under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and @entity51 , is scathing in its assessment of the @entity2 response on the ground			1
as the situation deteriorated in the past three months , " there has been no evidence of an adequate humanitarian reaction to the needs generated by repeated outbreaks of violence , " the letter said			2
" the only actions undertaken by @entity2 aid officials have been the collection of data related to the fighting and a few assessments confirming the need for an immediate response			0
repeated evaluations in the face of glaring needs , and numerous coordination meetings , have not led to any concrete action around the main hotspots			0
" the letter gives two examples in support of its criticism			0
" @entity1 has repeatedly asked @entity2 agencies to deliver food , tents and soap to the more than 15,000 people displaced in the vicinity of @entity29 's airport , without any reaction , " it said			1
in the second example , @entity2 officials in @entity31 were on security lockdown inside a compound run by @entity42 - led peacekeeping forces , the letter said			2
they " did not even provide assistance to the displaced sheltering inside the same compound , forcing @entity1 to intervene once more			0
" the same officials remained on lockdown for days after the fighting , it added , " abandoning the more than 30,000 displaced persons in the main @entity31 camps			0
" @entity1 staff instead moved through the camps to give help , the letter said			2
that assistance included taking care of the wounded , digging latrines and providing access to drinking water			0
the @entity2 said thursday that @entity2 agency personel have deployed to the field as security conditions permitted , adding that they are " working closely " with @entity1 and other key @entity117 who have maintained a strong presence in @entity120 during the crisis			1
" as this crisis worsens , it is important that all efforts and resources are focused on delivering aid to people in desperate need			0
as in all crises , there will be a time for evaluation of the humanitarian response , but now is the time for action , " the @entity2 said			0
@entity1 , which has been present in the @entity6 since 1997 , says it is currently running seven regular projects and four emergency projects there			1
it has more than 100 foreign personnel and about 1,100 local staff in its teams , providing free medical care to nearly 400,000 people			0
the group believes the @entity2 has overestimated the security risks in the @entity6 , thereby restricting its agencies ' ability to help " people in an extreme state of need			1
" an @entity1 news release thursday , published alongside the letter , said @entity2 humanitarian organizations had now decided to ramp up their response in the @entity6			1
but while this is welcome , the group said , it is long overdue			0
" this late decision must have a real impact and initiate radical and immediate change to the way @entity2 humanitarian agencies respond to the crisis , " said @entity154 , @entity1 director of operations			1
more than 415,000 people -- nearly 10 % of the population -- have been internally displaced by the fighting , according to the @entity2 , and 68,000 more have fled to neighboring countries			2
