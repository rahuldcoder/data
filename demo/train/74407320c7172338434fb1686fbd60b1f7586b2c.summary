-- hours of tv each day			0
all these factors expose us to culture and voices on a national rather than local scale			2
but if you think all this exposure is homogenizing our language , think again			0
regional accents are going strong around the @entity14 , bringing with them all kinds of cultural flavor			1
if you 're one of the many that assume all this media exposure must be homogenizing the @entity14 accent , you 're not alone			1
it sounds like a logical hypothesis : the accents heard in the media are far - reaching and pervasive , so local accents must be on the decline as the population is exposed to all this " standardized " speech			1
but experts say it 's a common misconception that has no basis in fact			0
" there is zero evidence for television or the other popular media disseminating or influencing sound changes or grammatical innovations , " wrote linguist @entity34 in a 2006 essay for @entity36			0
and experts agree that regional accents around the @entity14 are alive and well			1
but what effect are these regional accents having on @entity14 culture ? as part of the @entity51 cultural census , which examines some of the more intangible characteristics that define the @entity14 population , we asked people around the country to read a standard passage aloud so we could evaluate their regional accent			1
we also asked them to tell us a little about their speech : how they feel about their accent , who influenced it , and how they think others view it			1
some of the strongest opinions came from @entity68 with " country " accents : @entity71 or @entity72			1
these accents are among the most stigmatized in the @entity14 , and people who possess them have a wide range of views , from pride to annoyance			1
" i hope that when others hear me speak , they hear me , not my western twang , " writes @entity80 , who was raised in @entity81			0
@entity80 grew up singing with her family and got sick of hearing that she should only sing country music because of her accent			2
" i have made a concerted effort to speak with as little ' western twang ' in my accent as possible , " she revealed			2
@entity92 also tries to modulate her accent , but for professional reasons			2
a native of @entity95 , she says she 's proud of her accent and has " great appreciation for regional accents and dialects			1
" but she thinks this pride may not be appropriate for her workplace			2
" because i work in public relations , and because i am aware that some employ a negative image of people with strong ' hillbilly ' accents , i tend to modify my speech when i am conducting business , " says @entity92 , who lives in @entity101 , @entity95			2
according to law professor @entity111 , concerns like @entity92 ' are well - founded			0
@entity111 , who teaches and writes at the @entity112 at @entity113 , penned a frequently cited paper called " voices of @entity14 : @entity116 , @entity117 , and a jurisprudence for the @entity119 " for the @entity120			1
" @entity122 have shown that in the area of speech evaluation , we are particularly susceptible to the cultural stereotypes we have absorbed , " she writes			0
" low - status accents will sound foreign and unintelligible			2
high - status accents will sound clear and competent			2
" or , to put it simply , " there is significant discrimination against regional accents , " she said via e-mail			1
@entity111 argues that discrimination against both foreign and domestic accents , intentional or unintentional , can hurt people with a " low - status " accent when they 're looking for a job			1
a @entity142 psychology study from 2010 backs her up : the study found that people who spoke with a foreign accent were seen as less credible than those who spoke with a " standard " @entity14 accent			1
still , some @entity14 would n't give up their regional accent for anything			1
just ask @entity149 of @entity150			0
" i always hated my accent growing up , often trying to over-enunciate words to prevent sounding like the people around me , " she remembers			0
but her tune changed , literally , when she went through the hellish experience of @entity156			0
" after @entity156 , i was horrified when i realized this very cultural and unique thing might be gone forever , " @entity149 explains			0
" i moved back home and there is almost no way to describe how happy it makes me when one of my kids says something so local in our accent ! " " i love my accent			1
it is a part of me , " agrees @entity166 of @entity167 , @entity168			0
she , too , tried to change her accent for professional reasons when she was younger , and says she 's gotten her fair share of jokes from people who have " preconceived notions about southerners , particularly @entity177			0
" but now , it 's a point of pride			0
" i love it when others , especially northerners , hear me talk , " she says			0
" most of the time , they find my accent cute			0

regional accents are alive and well in the @entity14
we asked @entity68 to tell us about their accents
some feel having a local accent hurts them professionally
others say they take pride in their accent
