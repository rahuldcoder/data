-- on a day when opposition forces in @entity3 suffered battlefield losses , president @entity1 made clear in interviews tuesday with the three major @entity7 television networks that he was open to arming the rebel fighters			1
" i 'm not ruling it out , but i 'm also not ruling it in , " @entity1 told @entity9 in one of the separate interviews he gave the day after a nationally televised speech on the @entity3 situation			2
" i think it 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into @entity3 , we probably could , " @entity1 told @entity14			0
" we 're looking at all our options at this point			0
" the president also signaled a willingness to negotiate a settlement to the conflict with @entity3 leader @entity24 , but only based on the condition that @entity24 would relinquish power as called for by the @entity7 and its allies			1
asked about the chances of @entity24 fleeing or losing vital support from his family and top aides , @entity1 said that he believes those close to the @entity3 leader likely feel what he called a tightening noose			2
" i think that @entity24 's camp , people around him , are starting to recognize that their options are limited and their days are numbered , and so they are probably reaching out to a range of different people , " @entity1 told @entity36			1
" but that information may not have filtered to @entity24 yet and i think it 's too early for us to start having formal negotiations			0
" @entity24 " knows exactly what he needs to do to stop the constant bombardment that he 's under , and it may at some point shift to him to figuring out how to negotiate an exit , but i do n't think we 're at that point yet , " @entity1 continued on @entity36			1
on @entity14 , the president said that " the first step is for @entity24 to send a signal that he understands the @entity3 people do n't want him ruling anymore , that 40 years of tyranny is enough			0
" " once he makes that decision , i think the international community will come together and make a determination as to what the most appropriate way of facilitating him stepping down will be , " @entity1 said			0
the interviews continued the determined tone of @entity1 's monday night speech , which detailed the strategic and moral reasons for committing @entity7 troops to the @entity3 mission while also promising the @entity7 role would be limited in time and scope			1
initially led by @entity7 forces due to their " unique capabilities " for taking out @entity3 's anti-aircraft and communications stations to establish a no - fly zone , the mission shifts to @entity81 control this week so allied nations share the responsibility and costs , @entity1 said			2
he pointed out to @entity36 that coalition airstrikes on @entity24 forces threatening civilian populations " will continue for some time " despite the transfer in mission leadership			0
" one of the questions that we want to answer is , do we start getting to a stage where @entity24 's forces are sufficiently degraded , where it may not be necessary to arm opposition groups ? " @entity1 said on @entity36 .			1
