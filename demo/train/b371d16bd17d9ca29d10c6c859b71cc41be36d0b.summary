@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 's richest man , received the green light to become a candidate for the @entity6 of @entity3 's @entity7			1
if elected , @entity2 will be the first private entrepreneur to join the ruling party 's policymaking body			1
@entity2 , 55 , is chairman and founder of @entity11 , @entity3 's largest heavy machinery company			1
both @entity12 and @entity3 @entity13 rank him on top of their 2011 rich list , estimating his wealth at $ 9.3 billion and $ 10.7 billion , respectively			1
he @entity17 , @entity11 's vice president , confirmed with @entity1 that " @entity2 has passed qualification checks " as a candidate for a seat as alternate member of the @entity7			1
@entity2 is " waiting for ( formal ) election , " which will take place late next year			1
the @entity7 is an important body in @entity3 's top - down political structure			1
every five years , delegates to communist party congress elect over 200 full - fledged members and about 150 alternate members			2
members of the @entity7 select among themselves members of the party 's political bureau , or politburo , and its standing committee comprised of nine members			1
the @entity7 typically meets four times a year to discuss and approve major policies			2
in between these meetings - called @entity39 in communist parlance - major decisions are made by the @entity43 , headed by party chief and state president @entity45			2
its members meet more frequently			0
@entity2 became a communist member in 2004			2
since then , he has been a delegate to the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , @entity3 highest legislative body			1
he was also a delegate to the last @entity51 in 2007			0
@entity2 has three times applied to become a party member but he was rejected each time			1
the last time he was rejected was because " the @entity55 did n't allow recruiting private entrepreneurs who hire more than seven employees , " @entity54 , a director at the @entity11 , told @entity1			2
@entity2 's party membership came after former @entity61 president @entity60 pushed through the controversial notion that private business owners may also join the @entity6 in 2001			1
" currently there are very few party members working in the private sector , " notes @entity64 , author of the book " @entity66 and @entity67 in @entity3			2
" " there is a need to correct this imbalance by recruiting non-party private entrepreneurs , as this group of people is gaining economic power			0
if they are not co-opted , they can potentially wield independent political influence			0
" @entity81 , who has served as chief researcher for @entity83 for many years , says @entity2 's expected election into the @entity7 is largely symbolic			1
he points out that the private sector is " clearly an important player now in the economy as a whole , " creating new jobs and paying substantial taxes			0
" it is a symbiotic relationship , " he says			0
" they help each other out			0
" if @entity2 is elected next year , @entity81 adds , his new political status will be a morale boost for @entity3 's private sector and may also benefit his company , the @entity11 , which @entity2 founded in 1989			1
it will not be the first time for @entity2 to work with the ruling party			2
he and his company have been involved in high - profile partnerships with the @entity61 government			0
" it was n't a coincidence that @entity11 was in @entity104 to rescue the trapped miners last year , " @entity81 tells @entity1			0
" the @entity61 government offered to help and @entity2 was the person asked to make it happen on behalf of the government			2
it was a big thing			0
" @entity11 provided heavy machinery during the rescue efforts			0
during the devastating @entity112 earthquake in 2008 , @entity2 donated 3 million yuan ( us $ 461,000 ) in cash and 15 million yuan ( about $ 2.3 million ) worth of heavy machinery , according to state media reports			2
@entity11 's volunteer rescue team arrived in the worst hit area within two days after the earthquake hit			0
" @entity2 's increased political capital will help push @entity11 's dominance to a higher level in both domestic and international market			1
" said @entity122 at the @entity123			0
@entity122 says he will not be surprised if @entity2 is admitted into the @entity7			1
he explains : " by co-opting private business leaders into @entity51 , the party hopes to renew its legitimacy as the party that represents all the critical groups and sectors of the @entity61 society			0
" @entity64 says this will be an important move for @entity3 's political reform			1
" in the long run , the inclusion of the private sector in the @entity51 is likely to diversify the party 's membership , " @entity64 says			0
he explains : " different groups of party members may form different factions and compete for power within the @entity51 , instead of forming strong opposition parties outside the @entity51			0
the result is likely to be the strengthening of ' intra-party democracy ' with continued @entity51 domination over the other independent political parties			0

@entity2 can be a candidate for @entity6 of @entity3 's @entity7
the @entity7 is an important body in @entity3 's top - down political structure
