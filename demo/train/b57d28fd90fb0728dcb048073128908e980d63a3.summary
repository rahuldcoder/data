" a hundred rockets a day was a good day			2
" family members lived underground to avoid bombings , she said			2
yet they stayed out of a love for the people and a passion for providing eye care for the needy			2

but i think their feeling is , too , that this is a real passion that he had			2
" more than 400 people gathered sunday at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity23 , to honor @entity6			2
the church supported his trip financially and emotionally			2
" four weeks ago , @entity22 stood right here , " an emotional @entity55 , senior pastor , told the congregation			1
the church had printed wednesday in its weekly worship guide , " @entity59 that @entity5 's ministry in conducting outpatient clinics ... in a remote village was successful			1
@entity63 protected @entity5 and his team			0
" @entity55 said he decided to leave it in the guide even after hearing the news of @entity6 's death			0

@entity22 was heavily involved with training in optometry overseas , " enabling @entity3 to start picking up the work of eye care , because it was n't there , " his widow said			1
his passion for helping @entity3 ran deep , she said			1
" he would come back to the @entity112 and get throw - away optical equipment , then refurbished it , then would send it over to set up a little optical manufacturing factory , so they could make their own eyeglasses there			0
" when the couple married , they did n't foresee devoting much of their lives in @entity3			1
" we did feel we wanted to serve @entity63 with our lives when we were married			0
we wanted to serve him			0
we did n't know what that meant			0
" so the couple decided to make use of tools and specialties they had -- specifically , @entity5 's optical tools and @entity6 's teaching skills -- and took part in a program helping disadvantaged @entity3			1
" we went , and we thought it was going to be two years , and it was 33 , " @entity6 said			0
" we loved the people			0
... the @entity3 people were wonderful , absolutely wonderful to us			1
and they would be the first ones to protect us			0
so this is not the usual state of things , where they would murder all these people			0
" @entity6 said warfare in @entity3 did n't deter her or her husband			1
