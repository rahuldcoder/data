@entity0 , @entity1 -- tucked away on the sprawling campus of the @entity4 , an elite team of doctors and researchers search for clues to solve medical mysteries that have eluded a diagnosis			1
they 're detectives for a one - of - a - kind initiative at the @entity4			1
it 's called the @entity13 or @entity14			1
together , the @entity14 's team focuses its vast expertise on trying to save patients ' lives and creating new science			1
dr. @entity20 is the clinical director of @entity4 's @entity22 and the @entity13 's lead investigator			1
" the mission is really two-fold , " @entity20 says			2
" one is to try to get to a diagnosis for people who have struggled for so long to achieve a diagnosis -- of course there all kinds of benefits to that			0
the second is to discover new diseases or new aspects of known diseases so we can help the entire community of individuals with related disorders			1
" for many people with mysterious conditions , the @entity14 is their last hope for a diagnosis			0
" we try and be realistic about it , and get our patients to be realistic about the issues too , " @entity20 says			1
" so the first day of a typical visit , i 'll go in and tell the patients , ' you 've been to the best places in the country , now you 're coming here			1
we only have a 10 to 15 percent success rate			0
so i do n't want you to get your hopes up really too , too high			0
' but on the other hand , we do n't want to take all hope away			0
" there are an estimated 6,800 rare diseases in the world , according to the @entity4			1
the @entity4 defines a rare disease as one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the @entity65			1
but then there are other disorders that have yet to reach the diagnosis stage			0
that 's where @entity20 and his team come in			1
they take on the impossible with the hope that new science can be created			2
" it 's really sort of the inspiration we all have as clinical researchers , " says @entity20			2
created as a government pilot program in 2008 , the @entity14 has received more than 3,000 inquiries			0
but it has only accepted slightly more than 300 patients			2
to be considered for the @entity14 , a patient must be referred by a doctor and have his or her case well - documented in medical records			2
@entity20 and a panel of experts then have the difficult job of selecting who will be accepted			0
" i have to take some solace in the fact that even though we 're turning down a lot of people , we 're still helping a chosen few , " @entity20 says			0
those chosen few head to @entity4 's clinical center for a week of complex and exhaustive tests			1
the clinical center is the world 's largest hospital devoted to clinical research and allows the @entity14 team to perform around - the - clock testing with state - of - the - art technology			1
but what makes the @entity14 truly unparalleled is its collective approach to every case			0
it is designed to call upon experts throughout @entity4 's 27 institutes to look not only at their individual areas of specialty , but how those specialized areas fit into the bigger puzzle			1
after one week , the patients are sent home			2
that 's when the real detective work begins for @entity20 and his team			2
using the process of elimination , they pursue every option and sift through every clue , hoping it leads them to a diagnosis			0
" this is a different paradigm			0
" so this to me is the perfect amalgam of the training in knowledge -- having acquired a certain fund of knowledge -- and then applying it to cases that are not yet solved			0
so i find that extremely stimulating			0
