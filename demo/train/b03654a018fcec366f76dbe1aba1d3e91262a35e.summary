-- as beer bottles flew and bonfires burned at the annual @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , over the weekend , those following the events online compared the " riotous behavior " near @entity12 to protests in @entity9 , @entity10			1
their common refrain : a racist double standard in law enforcement response and media coverage that they attempted to mock using hashtags # @entity18 and # @entity20 , among others			2
' apples to oranges ' such comparisons are complicated , experts say , because @entity4 and @entity9 arose from different circumstances			1
yes , law enforcement deployed tear gas and rubber bullets at both scenes , but otherwise , the two events are an " apples to oranges comparison , " said @entity34 , associate professor of history at @entity36 in @entity37			2
based on what we know about @entity4 , the mostly white riots appear to have stemmed from alcohol - fueled parties			1
@entity9 is an ongoing , organized movement prompted by the shooting death of an unarmed black teen , said @entity34 , whose research focuses around civil rights , social movements and policing			1
" it demeans @entity9 and @entity52 to compare them to @entity3 , " said @entity34 , who has spent time with protesters in @entity10			1
" while the use of tear gas reflects how normative these militarized population control measures have become , @entity9 is a political movement , and looting ( in @entity4 ) is quite different from the civil disobedience we 're seeing in @entity9			1
" sentiments about the militarization of law enforcement echoed throughout social media over the weekend , but they were largely overshadowed by racial discourse			1
that 's where the conversation took a productive turn , @entity34 said : by shifting the discussion from comparisons between @entity9 and @entity4 to differences in how society perceives black and white behavior			1
" that kind of comparison is really important because it 's those attitudes that make state violence possible , " @entity34 said			1
" white youth are allowed to be children and have a sense of protection no matter how they behave , while black youth are criminalized by justice system			2
they 're not allowed to have childhoods			0
" perceptions of behavior those perceptions extend to riots , too , which most people tend to associate with the black community , said @entity93 , director of undergraduate studies at the @entity96 - @entity95 and author of " race , riots , and roller coasters : the @entity101 in @entity102			2
" " race riots " tends to conjure memories of the @entity105 acquittal or 1967 @entity106 , but those are anomalies , @entity93 said			0
throughout history , white mobs have perpetrated the majority of racially motivated riots against the black community over integration in public and private life -- from the 1863 draft riots to the civil rights battles of the 1960s			0
" it speaks to the notion that white violent behavior is not something talked about or stigmatized in the media or in mainstream society to extent that @entity127 rioting or looting behavior is , " @entity93 said			0
@entity3 was a dramatic version of that because of initial characterizations of crowd behavior as rowdy : vandalization of cars and streets signs , fighting police and setting fires in the streets			1
white people frequently get " rowdy " at sporting events or music festivals , but that behavior is not associated with the white community on the whole in the same way that instances of looting or vandalization tend to be associated with the black community , she said			0
" white behavior gets normalized , " she said			0
" in the @entity127 - @entity127 community , the long - term complaint is that the behavior of a small number of people stigmatizes the entire race or community			0
but you do n't hear that same racialized language about small groups of white people that behave badly			0
they do not stigmatize the community in the same way			0
" picking battles journalism professor @entity166 of the @entity167 agrees that comparing the nature of the two events is " preposterous , " seeing as @entity9 arose from " enduring , longstanding " issues related to race and inequality that keep the protests alive , unlike in @entity4			1
but as far as media coverage goes , he sees the two as having more in common than others might believe			0
both instances were framed as narratives in which the media strove to maintain neutrality by depicting facts on the ground -- what happened , who was there , how many arrests -- essentially , a story pitting police against the crowd instead of going deep into the themes and issues			2
" when we do that , the underlying message is , here 's a group that was creating chaos or disrupting order , and the response of police was to restore order , " said @entity166 , whose research focuses on the impact of media coverage in social conflicts			0
" if there is justification for being upset about the coverage , it 's the fact that the @entity9 situation was treated so much like the @entity5 , not that they were treated differently			1
they were treated like they did n't have enduring issues or evidence to support their frustrations and claims			0
" he understands the history of discrimination and inequality that gives rise to frustrations when incidents like this occur			0
but " if i were them , i 'd pick their battles to focus on the bad coverage in @entity9 , " he said			1
" there are a lot of things to be concerned about in racial inequity and discrimination			2
this may not be the best example case to hold up			0

experts say what happened in @entity4 was a riot ; @entity9 is a political movement
and yet @entity3 violence prompted important *debate* about racial perceptions
