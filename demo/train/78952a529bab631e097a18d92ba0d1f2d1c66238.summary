@entity1 , @entity0 -- sometimes , implementing wide - reaching social change takes surprisingly few materials			1
with just a handful of bike gears , @entity6 professor @entity5 is hoping to change the developing world forever			1
winter is the inventor of the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
it is a low - cost wheelchair powered by two hand levers that function in a similar manner to gears on a bike			1
the higher you grab it , the more leverage you get when traversing over rough terrain like sand , mud , or unpaved road			1
grab down lower , and the machine can cruise along tarmac at five miles - an - hour			1
it is one of the most versatile wheelchairs on the market , and for the time being , it is aimed solely for disabled communities in the developing world			1
" if you are a wheelchair user who lives in a rural area , there 's not really a good mobility aid that allows you to travel a long distance on many types of terrains , but is also small and maneuverable to use indoors			1
" that is kind of what set the stage for creating the @entity11 , " says @entity5 , who forms part of the r&d team at @entity41 , the socially enterprising design collective that brought the wheelchair to market			1
it may seem like a simple premise , but the @entity11 has the potential to empower a community that , in poorer countries , can often feel disenfranchised			2
" as this technology has grown and become a product , it 's been very fulfilling to see that not only can people ride off - road , but having that capability also lets them have a job , or go to school or fully participate in their community , " says @entity5			2
what makes the @entity11 a truly invaluable tool in low income communities is its sheer value for money			0
traditionally , wheelchairs with the capability to go off - road clock in somewhere between $ 4,500 and $ 6,500 , making them prohibitive to the rural communities that need them the most			2
the @entity11 , by comparison , costs $ 200			0
the low price point , explains @entity5 , makes it a sexier sell to the non-profit organizations responsible for delivering these units to emerging markets			0
" it had to be cheap enough to fit within the current provision and donation structures that already distribute wheelchairs , " he says			0
furthermore , @entity5 recognized that to be of use to the developing world , it had to be built from parts that were easily accessible			2
" the chair not only had to be repairable , but we wanted it robust , " he says			0
" we wanted it to have minimal parts that could break in the field , but if the parts do need servicing , they 're made from bike parts and they 're easily available			0
" @entity5 's inspiration for the @entity11 came about in 2005 , when he spent a summer in @entity99 assessing wheelchair technology for a group of wheelchair organizations			2
he later started developing the technology as a graduate student at @entity6			1
" when we started the project , we were a team of gung - ho students who had this cool idea for the lever system			2
we made some prototypes and were excited about them and brought them abroad and people were like , ' these are terrible			0
what were you thinking ? you have no frame of reference of what it 's actually like to use a wheelchair everyday , ' " he recalls			2
over the next few years , he consulted continuously with wheelchair users , and went through several stages of trial and error before landing on the current model			0
@entity5 is currently working with design consultancy firm @entity128 on a version of the @entity11 for the first - world			0
in all likelihood , it will have more features than the original			0
" in the developed world , because there is more disposable income , it 's possible to add additional functionality , things that simply are nice to have but not essential to have , " notes @entity135 , @entity128 's president			0
the more advanced ( and likely more expensive ) model , though , " can help support the developing world wheelchair , " he adds			1
for @entity5 , however , the greatest implication of his invention is the platform it has given him to enact even more , farther - reaching change			0
in a few years , @entity5 has gone from @entity6 graduate to assistant professor of mechanical engineering , and director of the @entity153 's @entity152 and @entity154 , an enterprise that couples engineering and product design to solve real - world problems			1
in addition to the @entity11 , he has delved into how to deliver low - cost prosthetics to poor countries , eco-efficient irrigation systems that enable small - scale farmers to get a higher crop yield and projects related to water purification			1
video : helping the disabled make music " i am a total geek , " admits @entity5			0
" i love engineering , i love innovation , and i love being able to work on problems that nobody else has solved before			0

an @entity6 professor has developed an *affordable* all - terrain wheelchair for developing countries .
the device has given disabled *persons* in poor countries more *freedom* .
winter continues to pursue engineering - *based* solutions to worldwide social issues .
