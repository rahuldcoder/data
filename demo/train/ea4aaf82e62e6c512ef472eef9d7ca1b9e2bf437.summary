-- where 's @entity2 ? where did she go ? do n't bother looking for her this week on the podium of the @entity6			1
do n't try to catch a glimpse of her in the backrooms where the powerful gather or on the convention floor where delegates wave signs proclaiming their love for @entity14 or @entity15 ( the other @entity15 ; the husband )			2
no , while @entity19 try to stoke the troops with passion for their party and excitement for @entity14 's re-election , the most popular member of the @entity19 , possibly the most popular major politician in @entity18 , will stay far away from the national spotlight , about 10,000 miles away			1
secretary of state @entity2 is occupied with other matters , serious matters of state			1
no time for cheering or voter - rousing			2
she 's keeping her distance from politics , and that might work out just fine in a few years			1
as @entity19 started streaming to @entity35 , she jetted off to the middle of nowhere			0
or , more precisely , to the @entity37 in the @entity38			0
by now , @entity2 -- as everyone calls her unofficially ( and we 're speaking unofficially ) -- has moved on in her busy @entity44 itinerary			1
as you read this , she may be in @entity47 , or in @entity48 , or perhaps @entity49			0
the official explanation is that she had important business and as a sitting secretary of state , she is supposed to stay above politics , above the partisan fray			1
indeed , former secretary of state @entity55 said it is customary for the current secretary to avoid the political season , as she did in 2008			1
@entity2 , however , is not just any secretary of state			1
she is the woman who almost beat the current president for the nomination			1
she 's the one millions hope will lead the ticket in 2016			1
she is the one @entity64 on everyone 's mind this week even if she made it a point to move her operations to the other side of the world			1
journalists will find it difficult to ask her opinion about the convention or ask the real question , the one people have not stopped asking in four years : will she run for president in 2016 ? the standard answer is that she has no interest in running again and looks forward to private life after @entity14 's first term			1
but few people believe she has made that decision			0
the reluctance to take her at her word stems partly from the stunning phenomenon of worldwide popularity that @entity2 has become			1
for every one of the past 10 years , @entity18 have ranked her the @entity90 , ahead even of @entity91 when she had her show			1
@entity2 is probably among the most popular women in the history of the @entity18 , having won the title 16 times , more than any other woman			1
she consistently scores the highest approval ratings of any top member of the @entity14 administration , and she has developed an extraordinary level of personal rapport with the masses , with the millions who have never met her but have seen her evolve over the decades			0
people feel an emotional connection after having witnessed the visible pain she endured during her husband 's public cheating scandals			2
they watched her raise her chin , battle adversity and come out ahead			0
everyone knows it has not been easy			0
liberated from campaigning , she has relaxed			0
she has become more spontaneous and genuine , leaving behind some of the calculated deliberateness of the politician			0
@entity2 's most private moments seem to fill her admirers with vicarious joy			1
when images surface of her dancing or drinking a beer during a break from work in @entity126 , they immediately go viral			0
as if people felt glad that she 's happy			2
the internet parody " texts from @entity2 " became all the rage , as it purported to show the ubercompetent secstate whipping the world into line			1
in one image , president @entity14 , stretched out on a couch , sends a text , " @entity137			2
whatchu doing ? " @entity2 , looking stylish in shades , with giant briefing books before her , texts back : " running the world			2
" it 's a joke , but it 's funny because it reflects an image that has taken hold			2
@entity2 seems to work harder than anyone			2
she has traveled to more countries -- 108 so far -- than any of her predecessors			0
she 's always at it			2
and it always seems important			0
the mere mortals , the regular politicians , are out campaigning , telling half - truths and slinging mud			0
@entity2 's busy , working to keep the world running			1
as secretary of state , she is in a perfect position to work on issues that are much less controversial than domestic dilemmas			2
she does n't need to talk about tax increases , health care reform or the deficit			0
she does n't have to spar with the @entity162 and look petty or nasty in the process			0
it makes her look superior to the others			0
it puts her in great shape for 2016 , when she will be 69 , not too old to run for president			1
@entity2 first electrified activists back in 1995 , when she declared in her famous @entity171 speech " it is no longer acceptable to discuss women 's rights as separate from human rights			1
" and she has never let up on her efforts on behalf of women			0
but men , too , even the most rugged ( even @entity162 ) have come to respect her			0
back in 2010 , when a @entity180 reporter quoted senior military men in @entity182 disparaging the @entity14 administration , he revealed that , " only @entity2 receives good reviews			2
" and she has not stopped getting great reviews			0
staying out of the political mud - pit , she is the subject of popularity polls , breathless speculation and gushing profiles , like a recent cover story -- complete with photo spread -- in @entity193			0
in addition to the glamor and the competence , the writer revealed " one very intimate detail that most people still do n't know about @entity2			2
" the secret ? " she does not sweat			0
she does not even glow			0
no matter how high the heat , not a drop nor a drip nor a bead ... " the polls show voters want @entity2 to run again			1
in @entity209 , a look at presidential preferences showed @entity2 beating vice president @entity210 60 to 18			1
no one else reached 5 %			0
in @entity213 , voters want @entity2 to run even more than they want their very popular governor to do so			1
so , while the @entity19 shout themselves hoarse in @entity215 , @entity2 will be far away , busy with affairs of state			1
but do n't be so sure her absence means she 's not interested in politics			2
like everyone in @entity215 , she too is probably pondering what @entity2 will do in 2016			1
she may be absent , out of sight			0
but staying away only makes the @entity19 ' heart grow fonder			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			0

@entity2 , the most popular @entity64 in the @entity18 , is in @entity44 tour during convention
it 's customary for a current secretary of state to stay above politics , avoid election season
@entity236 : being removed puts her above it all , positioned for a 2016 run for president
@entity242 : @entity2 *insists* she will not run , but *democrats* are hoping *fervently* she will
