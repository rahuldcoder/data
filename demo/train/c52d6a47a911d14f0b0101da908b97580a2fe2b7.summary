@entity0 , @entity1 -- with years of bloodshed in its recent past , @entity1 does n't want for symbols of conflict			1
but if one image conjures up the country 's fractious political climate better than any other , it 's the burning tire			1
a common sight during the civil war that ravaged the country from 1975 to 1990 , these impromptu roadblocks have re-appeared with regularity in the decades since , whenever flashpoints arise between @entity1 's diverse religious communities , or grievances swell up against the government or army			1
but an activist group in the country 's @entity23 - dominated south is reclaiming what has become a wearying symbol of division and conflict , and is recasting it as a symbol of national dialogue			1
in recent weeks , tires painted in bright colors have appeared in the center of the southern city of @entity36 -- arranged not as barricades , but as coffee tables , chairs , flower pots and book shelves			1
" when people first see the tires , they laugh and say ' wow , are you planning to burn them ? ' " said @entity42 , one of the organizers of the project , through a translator			1
" but then they would sit and talk , and ask us to do more all over the town			0
because we do n't need more burning -- we need something beautiful , something that brings happiness			0
" @entity42 is the president of the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , a group formed four years ago to engage young people struggling with life after the 2006 conflict with @entity61			1
the 34 - days of fighting left between 850 to 1,190 @entity1 civilians and combatants dead , particularly affecting the southern parts of the country dominated by @entity23			1
regarded by the @entity68 and @entity61 as a terrorist organization , the @entity67 militant group holds power in the @entity1 government and operates social services such as schools and hospitals			1
@entity42 said the conflict had badly affected the young people of @entity36 , a @entity67 town of about 120,000 people , situated some 60 kilometers from the @entity61 border			1
" they behaved in a strange way			0
they were behaving like they are heroes			0
at the same time they were very sad because their brothers and neighbors were killed , but they would n't show it			0
" the young people were traumatized , but there was " no space " in the militarized post-war society for them to express their fears , anxieties or creativity , she said			1
" it was very difficult dealing with youth			2
they did n't discuss issues , they were just aggressive : ' you are with me or against me '			0
" read also : @entity1 's missing history with limited employment opportunities , and outlets such as arts and entertainment non-existent in the prevailing religious climate , young people increasingly drifted towards drugs or sectarianism , she said			1
" the youth did n't have many alternatives , " said @entity42			2
" no cinemas , no youth clubs			2
so they went to parties or they spent their time on the streets doing nothing , just smoking a hookah			0
" @entity121 is a 21 - year - old university student who has been involved with @entity57 for four years			0
" we were a group of youth looking for a safe space to spend our spare time -- especially after the war of 2006 , where everything in @entity36 ( seemed ) insecure for us , " she explained			1
" we had n't any space to live the way we liked , due to the bad political , social and economical situation ; we encountered a lot of taboos and we did n't see any horizons for our future			0
" since then , @entity57 has run programs to teach people conflict resolution , political engagement and leadership skills , all with a creative focus			1
typical of their approach was an interactive street theater performance , in which @entity57 actors set up a souk , or market , and offered to sell passersby drugs , their votes , their bodies			0
the message , explained @entity57 's executive manager @entity152 : " you can buy drugs , but the price is your future			2
you can buy election votes , but you have to pay with your honesty			0
" the group has held outdoor cinema clubs , workshops with members of the national soccer team , and encouraged participants to express themselves through music , dance and theater , with some going on to careers as performers			1
" the most important thing is that we learned how to create new ways to express ourselves and our opinion freely , and to send our advocacy messages to public , especially through art , " said @entity121			1
the tire project was motivated by recent sectarian unrest in parts of the country , following the shooting of a @entity184 cleric by the army			0
in a gesture of national unity , the tires were painted in the colors of the country 's various faith - affiliated political parties			1
" we have to say to people that we do n't need another civil war , " said @entity42			2
" we do n't need to be negatively affected by these signs			0
we have to struggle against it			0
" read also : @entity197 -- red desert to @entity199 their activities have led to positive changes in the town 's youth , said @entity152 , but met with opposition from religious elements			1
performing arts had become " taboo " in the religious climate of recent years , he said , and besides : " arts and cinema and theater are something attractive to youth			2
the religious parties do n't want us to do them -- they 're afraid that we will attract the youth , and they want the youth for themselves			2
" he said incidents where the @entity57 had been targeted included a man threatening to smash the projector at an outdoor film screening , vandalism of the organization 's office , and a false allegation made to police that its leaders were working without proper documentation			2
@entity152 said the fact the group had received @entity234 funding had led to gossip " that we are working against our people for the @entity68 @entity236 -- which is not true			1
" nevertheless the threats were enough to make some participants drop out of @entity57 activities			0
in response , the organization had learned " to be smart , " said @entity152			0
last year , @entity57 partnered with a number of like - minded organizations to declare a " week of joy " in the town to celebrate the marriage of a young couple			2
the occasion provided cover to distribute pamphlets and posters with the group 's messages , but more importantly , to break recent prohibitions against dancing and singing in the streets			1
" when we danced , people came from all over the city to dance with us , to watch from the balconies , " said @entity152			2
the benefit of the exercise ? " to break the fear , " said @entity42			0
" people are afraid to dance , because they 'll beat you			0
but you have the right to dance			0
why ca n't we do this ? we want to show people that if we insist , we can do whatever we want			0
