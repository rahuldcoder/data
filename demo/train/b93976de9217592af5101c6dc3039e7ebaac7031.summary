-- to fully appreciate all the @entity3 promises to offer , your imagination needs to take a rather giant leap			1
on display for the first time at an airshow , the brand new extra wide bodied passenger jet has been one of the @entity11 's major attention grabbers			1
flying high above the @entity13 , it looks sleek and maneuverable			0
it 's a big draw , part of the airshow 's static display sitting beside its key competitor , @entity19 's @entity18			2
but step on board , and it 's unlike any other experience on a passenger jet , because the @entity3 is still a test aircraft			1
packed with flight testing gear , including the equivalent of 400 kilometers of bright orange testing cables , every nuance of what happens when the plane is in the air is captured by equipment that feeds data live to @entity34 ' headquarters in @entity35			1
some 600,000 parameters can be monitored and recorded at any one time as part of that testing			0
large water tanks under the floor are filled to the exact weight the aircraft will carry when it 's full of passengers and baggage			2
the @entity3 first took to the skies on june 14 last year			1
soon after , it performed a fly - by at the @entity49			2
so far two test planes have clocked 1,000 hours of flying time , some in extreme conditions			2
to date the @entity3 has experienced the cold of northern @entity55 and the high altitude of @entity57 in @entity58			1
in the next few weeks it will also conduct tests in the stifling heat of the @entity61			0
all five test @entity62 will have to fly for 2,500 hours before achieving certification			2
selling features this is a passenger jet made up of 53 % composite material according to @entity68 from the @entity69 , the highest of any commercial aircraft			0
this allows the @entity3 to travel as fuel efficiently as possible , lowering operating costs			1
the wings of the jet incorporate the jet maker 's latest aerodynamics and advanced low - speed controls			0
the curled winglets are designed to reduce drag , again saving fuel			0
essentially the plane will fly further for less , to help offset the high cost of buying the aircraft , which has a list price of $ 254 million - 322 million depending on size			1
also adding to the customer experience , @entity34 says , are the @entity3 's low noise levels			1
this airplane has already been nicknamed by some as the " @entity91 , " a title @entity34 has embraced			1
" the noise levels for the aircraft are going to be very low , " says @entity68			0
" it 's designed to be a very quiet aircraft both in the cabin and for surrounding space as the aircraft flies around			1
noise pollution around airports is something that we work to reduce			0
" @entity34 also says its custom @entity106 engine is unrivaled in terms of fuel efficiency , and contributes to the aircraft achieving a 25 % reduction in seat - mile costs and 25 % lower carbon dioxide emissions			1
passenger experience for passengers , @entity34 says it 's offering great quality air ( replaced on the aircraft every two to three minutes ) , wider cabins and 18 - inch - wide seats in economy			1
when carrying 315 passengers this plane can travel 7,800 nautical miles , or an equivalent 17 hours , useful when research suggests passengers of the future will be flying for longer			0
the twin aisle jet can carry between 250 and 400 passengers			0
it 's designed to have an economy class carrying nine abreast , but the @entity3 will come in three sizes , the @entity3 , @entity131 and @entity132 , and can be configured to seat passengers from eight to 10 abreast			1
it 'll be up to the customer airlines to choose the mode of inflight entertainment			0
business class passengers will experience all the perks , with @entity34 promising mood lighting and the option for full flat seats			2
first class can be fitted at the customer airline 's discretion			0
it 's a lot to get your head around when you look at the airplane as it is today			0
" flight crew class " is what @entity68 laughingly calls the 50 odd well - worn gray seats the jet is currently fitted with , all recovered from old aircraft			1
for now , these are strictly reserved for crew and mechanics during test flights , but that will change			1
the first fit - out of an @entity3 with a proper cabin is expected next month			1
vips and media only the @entity3 arrived in @entity166 shortly before the airshow started			2
only a select few have been allowed inside , including aviation journalists and vip visitors , including @entity171 's @entity173 @entity172			0
on thursday the plane is due to fly 13 hours back to @entity35 , where rigorous tests will continue until the plane is ready to go to market			0
@entity34 says it expects that to be in the fourth quarter of this year			2
its debut customer , @entity180 , has ordered 80 of the aircraft			0
@entity34 has a backlog of orders for 814 a350 jets , from 39 customers , almost a third of which are from the @entity187			2
@entity188 is an award - winning freelance journalist living in @entity166			0
she has previously worked as a foreign correspondent based out of both @entity191 and @entity192 .			0

@entity34 put its @entity3 test aircraft , with its bare bones cabin , on display at the @entity11
for now , flights strictly reserved for crew and mechanics
first fit - out of an @entity3 with a proper cabin is expected next month
