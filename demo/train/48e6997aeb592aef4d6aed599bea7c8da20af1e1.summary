-- i want to translate the web into every major language : every webpage , every video , and , yes , even @entity7 's tweets			1
with its content split up into hundreds of languages -- and with over 50 % of it in @entity12 -- most of the @entity2 is inaccessible to most people in the world			1
this problem is pressing , now more than ever , with millions of people from @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and other quickly developing regions entering the @entity2			0
in this @entity22 talk , i introduce my new project , called @entity24 , which aims at breaking the language barrier , and thus making the @entity2 truly " world wide			1
" we have all seen how systems such as @entity29 are improving every day at translating the gist of things written in other languages			1
unfortunately , they are not yet accurate enough for my purpose : even when what they spit out is intelligible , it 's so badly written that i ca n't read more than a few lines before getting a headache			0
this is why you do n't see machine - translated articles on @entity0			0
with @entity24 , our goal is to encourage people , like you and me , to translate the web into their native languages			1
now , with billions and billions of pages on the @entity2 , this ca n't be done with just a few volunteers , nor can we afford to pay professional translators			0
when @entity53 and i started @entity24 , we realized we needed a way to entice millions of people to help translate the @entity2			1
however , coordinating millions of contributors to translate language presents two major hurdles			1
first , finding enough people who are bilingual enough to help with translation is difficult			0
second , motivating them to do it for free makes this next to impossible			1
the idea behind @entity24 is to kill two birds with one stone by solving both of these problems simultaneously			0
we accomplish this by transforming language translation into something that anyone can do -- not just bilinguals -- and that millions of people want to do : learning a foreign language			0
it is estimated that over one billion people worldwide are learning a foreign language , with millions doing so using computer programs			0
with @entity24 , people learn a foreign language while simultaneously translating text			1
when you learn on @entity24 , the website gives you exercises tailored specifically to you that teach you every aspect of the new language			1
you may be asked to translate a sentence , to pronounce or listen to a phrase , or to describe what you see in an image			2
some of the sentences you translate come from real websites			2
by having multiple students translate each sentence , and then choosing the best one , @entity24 produces translations that are as accurate as those from professional language translators			2
because you create valuable translations as a side effect , learning on @entity24 is 100 % free : no ads , no hidden fees , no subscriptions			2
@entity24 entails a new business model that allows anyone online , regardless of socioeconomic status , to have access to education			0
for example , the leading language - learning software sells for over $ 500 , which is beyond the means of the majority of the world 's population			0
if language education is offered free of charge in exchange for students ' performing useful tasks , those who can not afford to pay with money pay with their time -- time that would have been spent learning anyway			2
this is how i want to translate the @entity2			0

he used that *technology* to help *digitize* old books
