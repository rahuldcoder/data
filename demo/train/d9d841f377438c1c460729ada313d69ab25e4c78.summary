-- two suspects were arrested over the weekend after authorities found two tons of raw elephant ivory and five rhinoceros horns at @entity6 's @entity5 , the @entity7 said monday			1
the cargo had been disguised as avocados , according to the service , which says its mission is " to sustainably conserve and manage @entity13 's wildlife and its habitats in collaboration with other stakeholders for posterity			1
" " most of the tusks seem to have been collected from natural deaths of about 150 elephants over the last 20 years with the latest likely to be 6 months old , " it said in a news release			2
" none of the tusks had the indelible ink used for marking government - held stocks			0
dna tests will be conducted to determine the tusks ' actual origin			0
" the seizure and arrests resulted from a joint operation that included the @entity7 , @entity36 , @entity37 and the @entity38 , the wildlife service said			0
on saturday night , the airport 's warehouse security contacted a canine unit after becoming suspicious about a cargo destined for @entity44 through @entity45 by @entity46 , it said			1
" the cargo , which was falsely declared as containing only fresh avocado fruits , was packed in 12 wooden boxes , which raised a red flag due to its mode of package , weight and destination , " it said			1
inside the boxes , officials found the contraband packed among avocados and wrapped in black paper and banana leaves -- packaging used in an attempt to evade detection , the wildlife service said			1
last year , 204 elephants were illegally killed in @entity13 , up from 94 in 2008 and 47 in 2007 , the service said			0
also last year , 13 rhinoceroses were illegally killed in the country , up from five in 2008 , it said			0
in 1979 , @entity71 was home to some 1.3 million elephants ; by 1989 only 600,000 remained , a drop blamed almost wholly on the killing of elephants for ivory , the service said			1
there are currently about 400,000 elephants in @entity71 , it said			0
after the @entity83 banned international commercial ivory trade in 1989 , demand dropped as did the price of ivory -- from $ 300 per kilo to about $ 3 per kilo , it said			2
as some southern @entity89 elephant populations appeared healthier , restrictions eased in 1997 and 2002 , when @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity71 and @entity92 were allowed to sell limited stocks of ivory to @entity95 .			2
