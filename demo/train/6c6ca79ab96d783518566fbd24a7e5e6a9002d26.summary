@entity0 said thursday that it had successfully carried out the maiden test flight of its longest - range nuclear - capable missile , which can apparently travel more than 5,000 kilometers			1
the @entity5 rocket took off around 8:03 a.m. local time ( 10.33 p.m. wednesday et ) and " met all the mission objectives , " said @entity9 , director of the missile test site			1
the missile , whose stated range of about 3,100 miles puts major @entity15 cities within its striking distance , was fired from the coast of the eastern @entity0 state of @entity19			1
the @entity0 defense minister , @entity20 , congratulated the @entity21 for the " immaculate " success of the missile launch			2
@entity0 says the missile development is not an aggressive initiative and that its military program is based on building a credible minimum deterrent with a " no - first - use " policy			0
" our missiles are purely for deterrence , " @entity29 , a spokesman for the @entity21 , had said ahead of the launch			0
