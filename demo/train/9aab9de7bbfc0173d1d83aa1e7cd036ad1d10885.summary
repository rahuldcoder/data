-- @entity1 , the creative force behind some of @entity5 's best loved film music , including the @entity8 - winning @entity7 score , adjusts his chair in front of a sleek black instrument that looks something like the control panel of a stealth bomber			1
he raises his hands to the monochrome keyboard and presses gently			1
a familiar strain emerges from it : the opening lines of the @entity21 theme , but today it sounds unlike it has ever sounded before			2
the ' @entity22 ' is a tech forward interpretation of the piano , that attempts to reimagine what a keyboard can do			1
to test the device , @entity0 invited @entity28 to cast an expert eye over the @entity31 invention , and give a frank assessment of how it works			2
" the seaboard is really interesting , " @entity28 says , " because you 're forever trying to figure out how to make music more expressive			1
i 've always been involved in music and technology and this is quite a relationship we 're developing here ... we 're trying to figure out how to get beyond the boundaries of technology that was invented 600 years ago or so			2
" developed in the @entity31 , the @entity44 is the brainchild of multi-instrumentalist inventor @entity46			1
while studying at the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) in @entity49 , @entity47 decided to create a new keyboard that he hoped would be more expressive than the piano			1
" the piano was the first object i truly loved , " @entity47 says			2
" i played it all growing up ... but i became frustrated with its inability to modulate the timbre , and pitch and volume of each note			2
essentially i was jealous of guitar players who could bend notes at will on a single note			1
" the @entity44 takes the basic layout of a piano but allows a player to ' bend ' the sound of each note by using a range of different gestures that @entity47 says are based very closely on the gestures people learn when they first pick up the piano			1
moving a finger left on a key makes a note ' bend ' downwards			1
moving it right makes it go up a little			2
@entity47 believes that this opens up the expressive potential of the instrument , and serves to counter the " direct and unbending " nature of notes played on a piano			1
@entity28 says that in this respect , @entity47 has been successful : " it behaves much more the way you imagine as a human being you would want to interact with your notes			1
it does n't have that stiff ' plunky ' thing that a piano has			0
it automatically has a sort of sensuality to it ... look , if @entity100 or @entity101 had had one of these i think their music would have been x-rated			0
" the invention of an unusual instrument is nothing new of course			0
earlier this year a device called the @entity110 came out , aiming to bridge the gap between guitar , keyboard and violin			1
typically , new instruments have struggled to gain widespread traction , but some have been adopted by working musicians , such as the @entity119 used by @entity120 on the @entity122 soundtrack or the @entity123 which , for a period , @entity124 used in her live shows			0
@entity47 says he would love to see a seaboard in the hands of @entity130 or @entity131 , but that seeing it played by @entity28 was a particular thrill			0
@entity47 says that all of @entity28 's feedback was useful , but he was most surprised by the @entity138 composer 's interest in the @entity44 's tactile qualities : " one of the most surprising pieces of feedback that i got from @entity1 was his emphasis on the importance of the touch			1
i 've always known that the touch is kind of the core part of the @entity44 ... but he wanted to just go back and focus on the simplicity and the beauty and the expression of the touch and that was a really nice reminder to me of what was of the greatest importance			1
" the @entity44 goes on sale this week			1
@entity0 's @entity158 takes a look at other unusual instruments piquing the interest of musicians around the world : the @entity123 music can be heard , felt and with the @entity123 it can also be seen			1
mostly used in live music production , the @entity123 allows musicians to compose tracks by tweaking a series of objects placed on a multi-touch screen			0
those motions then trigger real - time changes in the music as well as a visual feedback that means you can ' see ' the song			0
@entity177 , who forms part of a live techno act called @entity180 , says that the physicality of the @entity123 " allows us to act on our intuitive musicality			0
" he says : " when i 'm playing my songs , it 's like i 'm arranging the instruments of a band			1
then i can build variations and mix it all together on the table surface in real - time			0
" the visual feedback means you can actually see the music and it 's also easy for the audience to understand what i am doing and connect to what i am playing			1
" although @entity177 does admit that it has some glitches : " one problem with the @entity123 is that sometimes objects connect to each other by mistake , which can lead to loud interferences in your track			0
" the @entity206 an instrument not unlike the @entity44 , the @entity206 by @entity208 has a similar structure to a keyboard but allows you to play multiple notes at once and have " integrated " control over pitch , volume and timbre			1
@entity217 , an @entity218 composer and pianist who has worked with a number of high profile musicians ranging from @entity222 to @entity223 , has recently recorded on the @entity206 for @entity224			2
" @entity225 blew my mind in that it is sort of a fabulous hi - speed collision between a piano and a @entity229 and yet something totally unique and totally expressive			2
also the sounds that have been painstakingly designed specifically for the instrument are gorgeous ! " says @entity217			0
see @entity217 perform a version of " because " by @entity234			0
the @entity119 it has a funny name and it looks ancient but in fact there has never been an electronic instrument quite like it			0
" eight analogue oscillators hum slightly out of tune with each other , which is the reason for the name : the discordant chaos sounds like being in the middle of a swarm of bees , " explains @entity241 from @entity242 , who are the main distributors of the @entity119			0
" the artist can control the color , intensity and direction of the swarm with an array of controls , but never to perfection , so working with the @entity119 is always an adventure			0
" fans include @entity120 , who used it for the soundtrack to @entity122 and @entity31 producer @entity265 , who has worked with big name artists including @entity268 , @entity269 and most recently , @entity270			0
" it 's such a sensitive piece of equipment that when you manipulate the controls there are almost an infinite number of harmonies			2
i 've never heard anything like it before			0
the noises it makes are completely unique and otherworldly , " says @entity265			0
@entity265 's label @entity283 , on which he records tracks in just one day , has 10 commandments			2
rule number seven is : " somewhere on each record the @entity119 will make an appearance			0
" @entity158 and @entity290 contributed to this article			0

the @entity44 is a *re-imagined* keyboard that allows players to bend notes like a guitar
@entity298 composer @entity1 describes it as ' *inspiring* '
the @entity44 's inventor believes it opens up expressive potential
