editor 's note : @entity2 is a @entity3 novelist born in @entity4 in 1961			1
having graduated from the @entity5 , he worked as a journalist , did his military service as a prison warden in @entity9 , then became a cameraman , writer of screenplays and author			0
his books are published in @entity15 by @entity16 in the @entity17 and @entity18 in the @entity19 the views expressed in this commentary are solely his			0
for two nights between the 4th and 6th of march , i barely slept			0
i was checking the internet every hour to see if @entity25 had started war with @entity3			1
then the feeling of imminent danger was replaced by emotional fatigue			0
although a war still seemed unavoidable , it did n't inspire the same fear as in the early days of the occupation of @entity34			2
@entity3 volunteers started to flow towards @entity34 and the @entity37 border with @entity25 , while roads filled up with armored personnel carriers and other military vehicles			1
@entity3 was making an attempt to flex its military muscles , both to test the condition of the army and to reassure the population that we could protect ourselves			2
it became clear that since independence in 1991 neither @entity3 presidents nor the government had taken care of the military			2
nobody thought that @entity3 might need an army ; it was as simple as that			2
nobody thought that until this year and now it 's an everyday topic			0
this , and a war with @entity25			2
@entity25 foreign minister @entity59 repeats each day that @entity25 does n't plan to occupy eastern and southern @entity3			1
but it would be odd if anyone believed him			0
@entity25 also did n't plan to annex @entity34			1
even @entity25 president @entity62 said that			2
on march 5 , @entity62 announced to the world that " military maneuvers " were successfully completed and by march 7 all @entity25 soldiers , together with their equipment , would be back in their usual location , leaving @entity34 alone			1
however , instead of the promised end of these " maneuvers , " more than 10,000 @entity25 troops arrived in @entity34			1
what to do with @entity34 ? when it comes to the occupation of @entity34 , the @entity3 government stands firm			1
something that must occupy the mind of @entity62 and others in the @entity79			0
this position is without doubt due to the @entity19 support of @entity3			2
the rest of the world agrees that @entity34 is @entity3 territory occupied by @entity25			1
while @entity62 continues to show he is not interested in the opinion of the rest of the world , this fact will have rather serious consequences for the occupied peninsula itself			0
@entity92 stopped all its flights to the @entity34 capital @entity95 and @entity34 residents are now anxiously waiting for the summer holiday season			0
a recent law passed in @entity99 about occupied territories means that @entity3 ca n't enter without prior approval from the authorities			0
@entity25 prime minister @entity103 , who visited @entity34 recently , promised 33 airplanes full of visitors from @entity25 each day during the summer			1
under pressure from the @entity79 , @entity25 airlines -- the only ones now flying to the peninsula -- have slashed prices on flights			0
i think @entity25 oligarchs will soon receive an order from the @entity79 to buy holiday packages to @entity34 sanitoriums and resorts for their employees			1
otherwise how will the @entity79 get 8 million @entity25 visitors promised to @entity34 this summer ? and if all of @entity25 's citizens do decide to support @entity34 hotels and resorts this summer , then who will visit the newly built super-resort of @entity126 ? but the summer season in @entity34 only lasts a little more than three months			1
and after that , what ? @entity34 produces wine and grows fruit			0
they can only export it to @entity25 , but @entity25 has enough wine and fruit of its own			0
@entity62 will have no other choice but to follow @entity137 's example and subsidize farmers and winemakers so they do n't grow anything and reduce wine production			0
the impact of this " acquisition " on @entity25 's budget looks scary			1
no wonder that the pre-referendum promise to quadruple pensions for @entity34 's residents has been replaced with one to reconsider it starting from january 2016			2
currently tram and trolleybus driver 's salaries are frozen , the number of suburban trains had been cut and people are trying to figure out how to keep on living			0
building a @entity158 ' @entity157 ' if the self - proclaimed @entity34 government asked me the question : " how can @entity34 keep on going ? " i would answer that we should create some kind of theme park there			1
something between @entity166 and @entity157 , but much bigger and more exotic			0
for the last 20 years @entity34 has been known for its love for everything @entity158			1
strictly speaking , @entity34 has remained @entity158			2
against the background of south @entity34 's truly stunning coast , lovingly preserved @entity158 monuments look very odd			1
my favorite one -- a big statue of @entity174 in @entity175 , not far from @entity176 -- has him standing on the cliff looking sternly in the direction of @entity179			0
there are times , when i think that @entity25 occupied this peninsula so that @entity3 nationalists could n't demolish these @entity158 - era landmarks , just as they did in @entity99 and central and western @entity3			1
so in my eyes the only possible solution to the complex economical situation in @entity34 would be the creation of a theme park of @entity158 life			1
considering that @entity62 has often said he considers the collapse of @entity158 as his own personal tragedy , it would n't be too much of a risk to call the park , spread over 27,000 square kilometers , " @entity196			2
" a simple , scary scenario but i know that for @entity3 this is not the right moment for jokes			2
nor for me either ; i look towards the near future with anxiety			0
my main concern is that @entity25 will start destabilizing southeast @entity3 before the presidential elections on may 25			1
@entity62 has already declared that he wo n't recognize the results of the elections , but what is even more important for him , is that these elections do n't take place at all			0
if they do n't then he can keep talking about the illegitimacy of the government , the absence of a legitimate president , and he can move further into @entity3 under the pretext of protecting the @entity25 - speaking population			1
the scenario of the @entity25 expansion could look very simple : may 9 will be commemorated as @entity219 -- something of an annual cult holiday for many in @entity25			0
you can expect that this year communists and @entity226 activists in the south and east of @entity3 will demonstrate , claiming to be commemorating victory over @entity229			0
the gatherings will follow a familiar pattern : the occupation of local government buildings and the planting of @entity25 flags on their roofs			0
it is clear that @entity3 authorities have got stronger and will use police and the security services to prevent this happening			0
riots will start with the first victims coming from the protesters and police			0
at that point @entity25 can send in its armed " peace - keeping " forces in to bring order			2
i am afraid that once @entity25 '' peace - keepers '' enter @entity3 territory they will not stop until they get to @entity99			1
that is because the @entity79 's main goal remains to put a @entity226 government in @entity3 , the kind that will sign an agreement of friendship and cooperation and will recognize to @entity34 as a @entity25 territory			1
only when this agreement is reached can @entity25 finally relax and develop the @entity34 peninsula legally and without the fear of political and economic sanctions from the @entity265 and the @entity19 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2			1

talk of war with @entity25 is on everyone 's mind in @entity3 , says novelist @entity2
@entity34 may become a burden on @entity25 and *isolated* from the rest of the world
perhaps its best future lies in becoming a @entity158 - era theme park , he jokes
fears that @entity25 will destabilize southern and eastern @entity3 before elections on may 25
