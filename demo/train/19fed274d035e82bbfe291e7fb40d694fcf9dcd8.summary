the skies above @entity1 are set to become a lot more crowded as wealth and air travel in the country take - off			1
@entity1 is going to need around 5,000 more commercial jets over the next 20 years to fulfill the needs of the country 's burgeoning jet set , according to @entity11 , vice-president of marketing for @entity13			1
in 2010 , @entity1 airlines welcomed aboard 267 million passengers ( in 1980 it was just 3.4 million ) , a number second only to the @entity17 ( over 500 million )			1
that represented a 15 % increase compared to 2009 as the country 's airline market steadily heads towards the stratosphere			0
@entity23 and @entity13 want to maintain their share of the booming market , but a much talked - about mission to create @entity1 's own civil aircraft business is aiming to challenge their dominance in a few years time			1
the vanguard of the @entity1 project is the @entity31			1
it 's a single - aisle , 168 - seat plane to rival @entity13 's 737 and @entity23 ' @entity34 , the small - sized jets that account for around 65 % of global airline sales			1
developed by the state - owned @entity38 of @entity1 ( @entity39 ) , the company hopes it will propel it to a place in the sun among the industry heavyweights			1
it wo n't be the first plane developed by @entity39 that has been in partnership with @entity48 firm @entity47 on smaller airliners , but it will have more indigenous design and manufacture features that previous aircraft			0
@entity53 and @entity54 are among the companies that will supply some of the aircraft 's avionics , but having international component makers is something that has been a common part of the aviation industry for many years , says @entity61 , @entity62 managing editor of @entity63			0
" it 's geared towards bringing pride to @entity1 by competing in a very visible market segment			2
its so they can say , ' we can do this , and do this darned well			0
' " just how well is unknown , as the @entity31 only exists in model form at present			2
from its current advanced design stage , a test plane is scheduled to be flying in 2014 , with 2016 targeted for the first delivery			2
a spokesperson for @entity39 says that it has so far secured orders for 215 planes and will announce new deals at the @entity81 later this month			2
those in the aviation world are already taking note , but ultimately its success will come down to the bottom - line , suggest @entity61 , and how much it will cost to buy and operate			2
" when an airline buys an aircraft it really has to look at its economics because profit margins are so thin			0
anything that helps them save money , they 'll do it , " says @entity61			0
" how much money ( the @entity31 ) will be able to save airlines is still not clear , especially as both @entity13 and @entity23 have come up with re-engineered variants of the 737 and @entity34			1
" @entity1 's three state - owned giants , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 will be the principle recipients of the planes currently on @entity39 's book			1
read how @entity1 's low - cost carriers are taking off last year low - coats carrier @entity107 was the one western airline to indicate it was considering purchasing the @entity31 , but @entity61 believes that most international airlines will be playing a wait - and - see game			1
" if you look at any aircraft program around the world , the very first aircraft of a family generally does n't tend to be the best , " says @entity61			0
" you would have to come up with a second variant that would improve the first substantially			0
only once the aircraft is out there and performing can those improvements be made			0
so a lot of people are looking at what they might do afterwards			0
that 's a good ten to 15 years away			0

@entity31 plane set to rival @entity13 and @entity34
state - owned company says first plane ready by 2016
@entity130 says it has 215 orders , mainly from @entity1 carriers
its success will come down to how economical it is , suggests *analyst*
