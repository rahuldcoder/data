-- wanted by the @entity1 : @entity2 translators			1
it might sound like a punch line , as " @entity2 " -- the common name for what linguists call @entity2 -- has long been the butt of jokes , as well as the subject of controversy			1
but the agency is serious about needing nine people to translate conversations picked up on wiretaps during investigations , special agent @entity13 said tuesday			0
a solicitation was sent to contractors as part of a request to companies to provide hundreds of translators in 114 languages			1
" @entity1 's position is , it 's a language form we have a need for , " @entity13 said			1
" i think it 's a language form that @entity1 recognizes a need to have someone versed in to conduct investigations			1
" the translators , being hired in the agency 's @entity34 -- which includes @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity42 , @entity43 ; and the @entity44 -- would listen to wiretaps , translate what was said and be able to testify in court if necessary , he said			0
" the concept is right and good , " said @entity48 , distinguished professor of @entity50 linguistics at @entity51			0
" why would n't you want experts who can help you understand what people are communicating ? " " on one level , it 's no different than someone from the @entity61 of @entity62 who speaks a distinct brogue , " he said			0
" the problem is that even the term ' @entity2 ' is so controversial and politicized that it becomes sort of a free - for - all			1
" and @entity2 is no longer spoken only by african - americans , @entity13 said , referring to it as " urban language " or " street language			1
" he said he is aware of investigations in recent years in which it was spoken by @entity67 , latinos and white people			0
" it crosses over geographic , racial and ethnic backgrounds , " he said			0
" [ @entity2 ] is linguistic defiance being reinforced by hip - hop , " said professor @entity77 , who leads the public relations committee of the @entity79			1
the @entity1 's recruiting " has it half right , " @entity77 said			1
although having translation help is a good law enforcement tool , @entity77 said , the term " @entity2 " may be counterproductive because " the social positions of speakers have been the object of ridicule			2
" the @entity90 professor also is concerned about racial profiling resulting from assumptions made from a speaker 's dialect			0
while the @entity1 wants to have the translators available , it may not need to call upon them , @entity13 said			1
he did not know how much it would cost to have the translators available			0
" i ca n't say it 's spoken all the time , like @entity100 and @entity101 , " @entity13 said			0
" but there are people trying to use this to evade detection " while trafficking in drugs , he said			0
asked whether agency currently has agents who can translate @entity2 , @entity13 said some who have worked on local police forces can help pick out words on wiretaps			2
the term " @entity2 " -- a blend of " ebony " and " phonics " -- became known in 1996 , when the @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 proposed using it in teaching @entity50			1
after the school board came under fire , it voted to alter the plan , which recognized @entity2 as a distinct language			1
the revised plan removed reference to @entity2 as " genetically based " and as the " primary language " of students			1
the board also removed a part that some understood to indicate that @entity67 students would be taught in @entity2 , although the board denied such intentions			1
" there is something of substance here , " said @entity48 , who said he has studied @entity2 for 40 years			2
" there are differences in terms of language and lexicon and so forth that are difficult to understand for most people			0
so it is an issue			0
what , of course , happens is , it gets politicized and trivialized by the very term ' @entity2			2
' " the @entity79 calls @entity2 a form of communication that deserves recognition and study			1
" characterizations of @entity2 as ' slang , ' ' mutant , ' ' lazy , ' ' defective , ' ' ungrammatical ' or ' broken @entity2 ' are incorrect and demeaning , " a 1997 resolution said			2
for @entity77 , all languages or dialects are " fundamentally equal			0
" @entity2 is a dialect spoken by slave descendants who live in many countries and do n't speak just @entity50 , he said			1
its early speakers were enslaved , isolated from other speakers of their language and denied access to formal education , @entity77 said			0
@entity48 -- who has authored more than 20 books on @entity50 dialects , including african - american english -- recalled the @entity172 trials during the 1970s , when there was debate over whether the saying , " off the pigs , " was a genuine threat to kill police officers or a more metaphorical saying			0
@entity48 acknowledged @entity2 often presented as " nothing but bad language			1
" but , he said , " however you view it ... why would n't you want to avail yourself of all the interpretive capability that you can get ? " african - american english is " a systematic language variety , with patterns of pronunciation , grammar , vocabulary and usage that extend far beyond slang , " according to the website of the @entity186 , a @entity38 - based nonprofit organization that says it aims to improve communication through better understanding of language and culture			0
" because it has a set of rules that is distinct from those of @entity205 , characterizations of the variety as bad @entity2 are incorrect , " the center said			2
" speakers of @entity2 do not fail to speak @entity205 , but succeed in speaking @entity2			2
" @entity207 @entity50 , a political advocacy group , supports the @entity1 's recruitment , said @entity210 , director of government relations			2
" having somebody to explain slang terms ... spoken by a particular community is an advantage if it allows them to understand a conversation , " he said			0
@entity207 @entity50 's primary focus is making @entity50 the official language of the @entity207 and backing laws that ensure immigrants learn @entity50			0
language barriers that contribute to conflicts between nations can be a " serious issue , " @entity48 noted			0
" it 's the same point here			0
" he said the translators could help in investigations , as " the differences between dialect and code words can get pretty blurry at times			2
" @entity13 said @entity1 plans to continue seeking the translators			1
" @entity2 is an evolving dialect and in some ways is growing in stature , " @entity77 said .			1

new : @entity79 says @entity2 a valid dialect
@entity2 is " a language form we have a need for , " @entity1 says
ebonics became controversial with a 1996 school board proposal
