" however , while boosting its military presence in the @entity5 , the @entity4 should abstain from flexing its muscles , as this wo n't help solve regional disputes			1
" the new defense strategy , which still lacks many specifics , is meant to pare @entity4 defense spending by at least $ 487 billion over the next decade and drops a long - standing doctrine calling for the ability to fight to simultaneous ground wars			2
the result will be a more " agile , flexible , ready - to - deploy , innovative and technologically advanced " force prepared to counter terrorists , rogue states and the threat of nuclear weapons worldwide , @entity17 said thursday			0
