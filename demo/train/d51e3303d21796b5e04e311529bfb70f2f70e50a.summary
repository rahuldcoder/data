@entity0 -- it 's been a long time since the @entity4 's cuisine was defined by sourdough and @entity6			1
ever since @entity10 ' renowned restaurant @entity8 opened in @entity11 and ushered in the local food revolution , the region has become home to a growing tribe of foodies , locavores , chef groupies and ecstatic eaters that i call " foodhemians			1
" they do n't just just worship food here , they raise grass - fed golden calves , humanely slaughter them and serve them with a side of precious			1
there are a million reasons why food is big in the @entity4			1
here are three : 1			1
the high concentration of wealthy , health - conscious people			1
a long tradition of epicureanism rooted in @entity0 's identity as a port town			1
but the big one is 3			1
@entity37 is a land of abundance from its wide variety of fruits and vegetables , courtesy of the @entity45 climate , to its dungeness crabs crawling on the ocean floor			1
now imagine if the foodhemians discovered that all of those foodstuffs were free			2
that all they need to do is know where to look			2
foraging is all the rage in the @entity4 these days			1
part of foraging 's appeal is its elegance : find wild things that you can eat , collect them and put them in your stomach			1
but things like private property , naturally occurring poisons and pollutants complicate what in theory is a simple project			2
so a paradox was born : organizations that help you get wild			1
@entity76 and @entity77 are two groups that offer foraging - related events			1
what 's wrong with @entity80 the 60 - year - old @entity81 ( read : " mushroom people " ) meets monthly and organizes occasional walks , but the most comprehensive foraging group in the @entity4 is @entity85			1
of course , you can also just buy a plant identification book and take a walk			2
i decided to spend $ 40 and go on a sea forage with @entity91 , fisherman and raconteur			2
his sea foraging tour , offered through @entity85 , was recently named " @entity95 " in @entity0			1
( he also offers variations on the foraging tour that you can learn about at his website			1
) @entity91 is a former catch monitor for the @entity101 , and , as my girlfriend pointed out , the only person under 70 who can wear a small brown fedora without looking like a tool			2
@entity91 is a commercial fisherman by trade , but he also teaches landlubbers how to identify edible seaweeds , find shellfish and catch sea creatures without a rod and reel			2
" everyone says the @entity4 is dead , the result of urban apocalypse and that 's bulls * * t , " says @entity91 while shoving squid into a little contraption that he 'll use to catch crabs			2
we are standing on @entity123 looking out at the @entity124 and the sun has not yet overtaken the moon in the sky			2
@entity91 's an entertainer as well as a fisherman			2
his grandparents and parents were vaudevillians and actors on @entity133 , but @entity91 's shtick -- and it is a bit of a shtick -- is the ocean			2
specifically , extracting creatures from it without a boat			2
his signature fishing method involves poking around for fish with a pole that has a six - inch line and a baited hook at the end			2
a practice that 's aptly named " poke poling			2
" " one day i was casting into the water all day and getting nothing			2
i 'd lost 60 bucks of tackle and was utterly defeated when i saw this guy walk by with a pole and bucket overflowing with fish			0
i thought ' no freaking way , ' @entity91 said			0
" i asked him what his secret was and he said ' everyone fishes out there , ' pointing to the water , ' but the fish are right here , ' pointing to the rocky coast			0
" @entity164 is not the new @entity165 the guy called himself ' @entity167			0
' he let @entity91 follow him for three days until he got the swing of things			0
now the poke pole is a permanent part of @entity91 's repertoire			0
the rest of his repertoire revolves around his encyclopedic knowledge of the creatures that live in and around the @entity4			0
the goose barnacles , the mussels , the crabs , the rockfish			0
the herring , the salmon , the sardines , the eel			0
@entity91 holds the @entity37 state record for catching the largest monkey - faced eel			0
we had our backs turned to the city the entire tour			0
which was kind of the point			0
@entity0 's vast cultural and architectural riches can sometimes reduce the @entity4 to blue embroidery around the bottom of a window , but the sea - foraging expedition reasserts the water to its rightful place at the center of things			1
which , ultimately , might be the biggest benefit of @entity91 's tour			0
because the truth is , it 's not advisable to eat anything caught east of the @entity124			0
the water is too polluted			0
@entity91 's methods are intended to be applied mostly up north in @entity211 or south of @entity0 in @entity4			1
if a traveler really wants to eat fresh - caught fish and foraged goodies in @entity0 , the best place to go is one of @entity85 's wild foods dinners			1
founded in 2008 by @entity219 , a young bearded guy whose knack for identifying wild foodstuffs is matched only by his knack for entrepreneurship , @entity85 calls itself a " wild foods community , " which means they do n't just gather and distribute wild foods , they also teach classes , hold market events and host wild kitchen dinners -- a roving monthly dinner party that pops up on boats and lofts around the city			1
unlike a mushroom in the woods , @entity85 activities are n't free			1
wild food walks are $ 30 and the underground meals are $ 90 a person , although they do reserve $ 40 seats for those who ca n't afford to pay full price			1
the dinner i attended was held on the top floor of a nondescript building in @entity0 's part - trendy , part - sketchy @entity248 neighborhood			1
a lone woman stood at the entrance discreetly taking tickets			0
as my girlfriend and i made our way up the stairs , we could hear the clink and laughter hum of revelry			0
the questionable legality of these gatherings gives them a mischievous charge as do the nontraditional settings			0
when we finally arrived on our floor and turned the corner we found ourselves in a room the size of a city block with two tables filled with 40 people each and an exposed clawfoot tub replete with functional plumbing and a guitar pick of soap resting on the drain			0
the crowd was n't just the beards and tasteful tattoos you might expect			0
there were @entity281 and dresses			0
the woman across from me worked at a bank			0
the woman sitting to my left was a grade school principal from a small town an hour south			0
our volunteer waitress was a scientist			0
here are the things we put in our stomachs : wild porcini escargot , braised octopus with wild nettle salsa verde , wild boar scotch quail egg with champagne @entity301 © e , black cod with morel duxelles and wild @entity306 spinach , wild nettle and heirloom tomato tart , summer bean and fingerling potato salad with wild grape verjus , lemon curd with wild elderberry cream and fennel pollen sugar			1
that 's a lot of wild			1
but when you learn that the escargot were found in yards around @entity0 and that the @entity306 spinach grows wild everywhere and that the morels , mushrooms and grapes were picked for free , and that the fish was line caught nearby and the boar was hunted and killed in the wild by the chef , even the skeptics have to admit it 's a pretty neat feat no matter how much words like " verjus " ( still do n't know what it means ) get your ( factory - farmed ) goat			1
oh , and everything was local , organic and sustainable , but that 's beside the point , even if , for some , it was the point			1
by the end of the meal the room was rumbling with pleasure			0
it was exactly the sort of thing you think you 're missing out on when you read about @entity0 and you 're not there			1
at this point in the night my notes got wobbly			0
the last thing i wrote down was , " ' @entity356 ' is playing			0
old people next to me smiling , obviously in love			0
yes , @entity360 's economy is in trouble , but yes @entity360 is amazing			0
