-- when @entity2 won the bid to host the @entity4 there was much pomp and pageantry in the tiny @entity8 state			1
ever since then , however , the successful bid has been dogged by controversy			1
issues relating to the feasibility of playing in scorching summer temperatures , the conditions of migrant workers building @entity4 infrastructure and allegations of bribery and corruption have all been raised			1
the latest are reports from the @entity23 's @entity22 newspaper claiming a @entity2 official paid more than $ 5 million to secure support for his country 's bid			1
that prompted some of @entity31 's main partners -- who are believed to pay around $ 180 million in sponsorships -- like @entity34 and @entity35 to voice their concerns			1
" we expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately , and continue to expect @entity31 to adhere to its principles of integrity , ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations , " @entity35 said in a statement			0
an independent @entity31 investigator is looking into the claims and his findings are expected in july			0
@entity2 says they are cooperating in the probe and that it won the bid fairly			1
but the debate has now raised questions about whether @entity2 could lose the 2022 tournament			2
some like @entity55 boss , @entity54 , believe a re-vote is necessary if corruption accusations are proven			0
as a result , doubt has been cast on whether the country should continue its preparations			0
work on the first stadium has already begun and the government has earmarked much of this year 's $ 62 billion budget for @entity4 infrastructure spending			1
without the tournament , some building plans could slow down			0
" the decline in construction activities is going to have an impact on overall gdp growth , " said @entity69 , chief economist for the @entity70 at @entity71			0
" if you look long term , the bigger risk is the loss of brand @entity2			2
" " @entity2 has ambitions to be the regional hub for congress , finance , tourism , etc. the world cup was an integral part of that plan , " @entity69 added			2
but @entity2 officials say plans will go ahead			2
" first we are confident that the world cup will be in @entity2 in 2022			2
second nothing will stop , everything will go forward in fast steps , " said @entity92 , ceo of the @entity93			0
" as we saw in @entity2 there are so many projects that started even before the announcement of winning the @entity4 ... the hospital , the metro , the stadium , the airports , the new ports , the @entity100 cities			1
" " all these are , you know , for the generations to come			0
it 's not only for one event , " @entity92 added			0
still , the uncertainty sent jitters through @entity2 's financial markets after the initial @entity22 report emerged			1
roughly $ 5 billion was wiped off the main stock exchange in the first two days , although some of those losses were later made back			1
yet despite the significant impact of these financial shocks , economists point out the country still has its enormous gas wealth to fall back on			0
it remains the world largest exporter of liquefied natural gas , a fact that 's not expected to change any time soon			0
" @entity2 's cost of extraction is much , much lower than all these new emerging sources are so @entity2 always has a cost advantage in terms of providing gas to the market , " said @entity69			1
" the other thing is that of course @entity2 has long term contracts in place that are very aggressive in tying in 20 , 30 year contracts , so its market share is relatively stable , " he added			0
whether this could change for better or worse if the @entity8 state loses the right to host the @entity4 , however , remains to be seen .			2

corruption allegations have been made regarding @entity2 's successful bid to host the @entity4
reports claim @entity2 official paid more than $ 5 million to secure support for his country 's bid
experts say claims could damage @entity2 's image but economy should remain strong
