@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities vowed friday to continue their aerial and ground - level dousing of water on a troubled nuclear reactor , with its owner saying that earlier attempts have been " somewhat effective " in addressing radiation concerns			1
still , the @entity11 complex of six nuclear reactors remained a danger			2
radiation levels peaked friday at 20 millisieverts per hour near in an annex building where workers were trying to reestablish electrical power , " the highest registered ( at that building ) so far , " an official with the @entity15 told reporters			1
radiation levels thursday morning at the plant were nearly 3.8 millisieverts per hour -- more than a typical resident of a developed country receives in a year			0
but @entity3 's @entity26 said 17 of 18 workers checked thursday morning tested normal , and the one who received a higher dose of radiation required no medical treatment			2
last friday 's earthquake and tsunami caused damage at four of the six reactors at the @entity11 plant , located on the northern coast of the @entity3 island of @entity39			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity40 said that efforts would resume friday afternoon to spray water from the ground and air in and around the plant 's no. 3 reactor , the sole damaged unit that contains plutonium along with the uranium in its fuel rods			1
they have done so already in two rounds thursday and another early friday , according to @entity15			2
based on the steam emitted after these water - spraying operations , @entity40 said that authorities believe there is still water in the spent fuel pool -- meaning fuel rods , which can give off radiation , likely are n't fully exposed -- though he said it was not clear how much liquid there was			1
@entity40 said friday morning that authorities are also assessing whether to also spray in and around the plant 's no. 1 reactor , though he added that the situation there was not as serious as in the no. 3 reactor			1
concerns remained about the spent fuel pool at reactor no. 4 , from which the @entity72 said no water - temperature data has been received since monday , and which a @entity75 official said wednesday appeared to contain no water			1
" the current situation at units 1 , 2 and 3 , whose cores have suffered damage , appears to be relatively stable , " said @entity77 , a top aide to @entity72 director - general @entity78			1
" @entity83 , in particular , remains a major safety concern			0
" but a @entity15 spokesman said friday that a video of the no. 4 reactor 's pool appeared to show it still contained water			1
@entity3 military helicopters dumped tons of water on the no. 3 reactor housing , including its spent - fuel pool , at the plant until after midnight thursday , @entity15 reported			1
earlier , fire and police trucks turned their hoses on the no. 3 reactor housing for more than an hour , and @entity15 said the subsequent steam and lowered radioactivity levels indicated progress			0
experts believe that steam rising from the pool , which contains at least partially exposed fuel rods , may be releasing radiation into the atmosphere			1
in @entity110 , @entity108 , a senior official of the @entity72 told reporters the situation remains serious , but there had been " no significant worsening " thursday			2
the state of the six nuclear reactors at @entity11 has raised the specter of a multiple nuclear meltdown -- the nightmare scenario in which fuel rods can not be cooled and the reactor 's core melts			1
in the worst - case scenario , the fuel can spill out of the damaged containment unit and spread radioactivity and cancer - causing isotopes through the air and water			1
all six reactors have been shut down , but some appear in better shape than others			0
a spokesman for the @entity26 , which oversees the running of the country 's nuclear plants , said friday morning that sea water was still being injected into the reactor pressure vessel of @entity141			1
a hydrogen explosion damaged it on march 12			0
white smoke continued to emanate friday from a hole in the @entity147 building , said the spokesman , who was not identified by name			2
in a news release , the agency said " an abnormal noise " from the pressure suppression chamber had occurred on march 15 and the chamber 's pressure dropped			2
workers have been moved away from the unit , though sea water injection continues			2
a power source for the cooling system of units 1 and 2 was expected to be connected friday morning , a @entity15 spokesman said			1
unit 3 has been particularly worrisome			0
it was struck march 14 by an explosion -- described by the @entity72 as caused by a hydrogen blast			0
fog -- possibly steam -- began rising from the reactor building on wednesday morning			0
unit 3 too is being injected with sea water and water was being sprayed into it			0
the pressure of the suppression " has been temporarily increasing since approximately 6:15 a.m. on march 17 , " the release said			0
temperatures in the spent - fuel pools at @entity177 and 6 had been rising slowly since they lost power			1
but engineers got an emergency diesel generator connected to @entity177 and 6 to cool their spent - fuel pools , a spokesman for the @entity26 said friday			1
water injection to the spent fuel pools was continuing			2
on friday morning , @entity40 said temperatures in and around those two reactors have risen , though not enough to pose any immediate danger , according to a report by @entity3 's @entity189			1
used nuclear fuel is stored in pools at each of the six reactors plus a shared pool and in a dry container storage , according to the @entity196			2
sixty percent of the total is in the shared pool , 34 % is stored in the six spent - fuel pools of the reactors , and the remaining 6 % is stored in nine dry storage containers , it said			1
there were " no safety concerns " about the dry storage containers			0
the spent - fuel pools -- located at the top of the reactor buildings to make it easier to handle the fuel during refueling -- were typically filled with water 16 feet or more above the top of the fuel rods			2
" the only way to rapidly drain down the pool is if there is structural damage to the walls of the floor , " the release said , noting that the pools have no drains and are built of concrete and steel			0
they lose water slowly due to evaporation when the units lose power and the cooling systems stop working			1
but the threat is not immediate			0
" rapid evaporation of the water will not occur , " the release says			0
if the water level drops below the fuel , " oxidation of the zirconium cladding could occur , " resulting in the formation of hydrogen , it says			2
but only fuel discarded within recent weeks would cause such a strong reaction , which would require temperatures of approximately 1,000 degrees @entity246 , it adds			2
zirconium melts at 1600 degrees @entity246 " the likelihood of cladding damage , as with hydrogen generation , decreases substantially with temperature and cooling time , " it says			0
it called the prospect of a zirconium fire " virtually impossible			0
" the @entity15 spokesman said the level of water in the main pool , which contained older fuel that had already cooled , was only 10 to 15 centimeters below normal			1
still , he acknowledged , officials had not been able to measure the temperature there			0
and nuclear engineer @entity265 told @entity1 that the effort will likely need to be sustained " for months , if not years			0
" " what 's pushing the firemen back is the radiation that 's coming from the spent fuel pool , " he said			1
if the spent fuel rods in that pool are uncovered , " there 's an awful lot of gamma rays flooding that site , forcing the workers to say further away			1
" public health officials say the release of radiation from a meltdown can cause immediate and long - term health problems , including radiation poisoning and cancer			0
about 200,000 people living within a 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) radius of the plant have been evacuated ; those living 20 to 30 kilometers from the site have been told to remain inside , and @entity3 has banned flights over the area			0
@entity293 , founder of the @entity295 - based @entity294 , which promotes international security , disarmament and arms control , told @entity1 that @entity3 engineers were " flying by the seat of their pants now ... everything they try goes wrong			0
they 're focusing on reactors , then spent fuel becomes damaged , " @entity293 said			0
" they 've just got to get water in there , keep the water pumping			0
" @entity1 's @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			0

new : efforts will resume friday afternoon to spray water on @entity319 's fuel pool , @entity40 says
new : authorities are also considering spraying on @entity141 , though that situation is less dire
new : @entity189 reports temperatures are up at @entity177 and 6 , but no *imminent* danger
one emergency generator for 2 units is running , with another power supply in the works
