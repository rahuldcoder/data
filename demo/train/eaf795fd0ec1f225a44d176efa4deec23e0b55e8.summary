the @entity1 relic " @entity5 " was a primo specimen of a tv police procedural with a catchy hook : a team of fresh - faced cops work undercover as high school kids , reporting back to their tough / earnest boss at the address listed above			1
the hit series ran for four years , and was notably progressive in its willingness to incorporate newsmaking social issues , including @entity14 , homophobia , and child abuse			0
but 25 years later , " @entity5 " the tv show is remembered primarily as the career kickstarter of @entity19 as a young actor with an obvious something			1
as it turns out , dim memories and a new generation of pop culture consumers work to the great advantage of " @entity5 " the movie : what this fast , cheeky , and very funny interpretation of the original premise sacrifices in teachable moments , it makes up for in intelligent giddiness			1
shaped by the precocious comedic smarts of talent - on - a - roll @entity36 ( who not only costars but also developed the story with @entity39 and is one of the executive producers ) , the movie morphs into an action comedy with a tonal complexity that marks it as a very contemporary creative project			1
it 's part homage and part wink at the past			0
it jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years			0
it bridges slapstick and action			1
it 's quick - witted with its pop references			1
oh , have you heard ? @entity19 makes a delightful cameo appearance ! on the surface , " @entity5 " follows the crime - fighting antics of odd - couple cop partners @entity61 ( @entity36 ) and @entity63 ( @entity64 )			1
their wonky dynamic is established in a perfectly placed opening flashback to 2005 , when the two were real high school students -- schmidt the klutzy , anxious nerd with a brain ; @entity63 the athletic , academically challenged coolio			0
seven years later , when both police rookies are coincidentally assigned to an undercover -- high schooler program , the duo are prepared to play out those same life scripts , until a mix - up alters fate			2
@entity61 is assigned a class schedule befitting a popular @entity81 ; @entity63 is shuffled into advanced - placement chemistry			2
( '' ap - chemistry , '' he calls it , laboriously reading his course list			2
) given a do - over , the two get to reexperience those less than wonder years			2
they get to work issues out			0
and by the way they get to bust a drug ring fronted by a smart and popular guy played with oddball charisma by @entity95			2
( the curiosity is n't that he 's the brother of @entity98 ; it 's that he 's so interestingly weird			0
okay , like his brother			0
) but that , as i say , is on the surface			0
underneath , " @entity5 " is a riot of risks that pay off , the biggest of which might be handing @entity64 funny business			1
and now for the revelation : the guy 's got bust - out talents as a really funny , self - aware comic actor			1
with all appropriate salutes to the busy fellow 's famous abs , and with full forgiveness for his participation in " the vow , " i am feeling the @entity64 charm for the first time			1
and wow , those scenes where the smart actor , playing a '' dumb '' character who realizes he 's not as dumb as he has always believed he is , fakes playing a dumb guy to mess with his smart partner 's head are kind of perfect			2
also , @entity64 can sustain a great , i mean great , dumb face			1
under the limber direction of @entity127 and @entity127 ( " @entity128 " ) , and working from a screenplay by @entity39 -- a script jammed , by the way , with so many oinky references to male reproductive equipment that i choose to believe the producers were rising to a dare -- @entity36 and @entity64 play their mutt - and - @entity136 act against a supporting cast equally fast on their feet			1
a refresher viewing of any old " @entity5 " episode may sharpen your appreciation for the kind of earnest ' 80s - tv police captain that @entity145 is tweaking in his funky turn as @entity61 and @entity63 's boss , but the joke is equally welcome without the historical background			0
explaining why he 's assigning @entity61 and @entity63 to shutting down the school drug ring after the death of one student , the captain tells it true : '' this kid is white , so people actually give a s ---			0
'' there 's room for laughs and truth at this newly reopened address			0
