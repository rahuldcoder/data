on the surface , @entity1 's $ 2 billion purchase of @entity2 , which develops virtual - reality technology , does n't make a lot of sense			1
@entity1 is a social network			0
@entity2 makes gear that enhances video gaming			2
how is this awkward marriage going to work ? maybe it wo n't : @entity1 moms and @entity15 gamers are an uneasy mix. then again , this may be a savvy bet by @entity1 ceo @entity18 on the long - term future of how we communicate			1
either way , there 's a lot of confusion surrounding this deal			0
so let us break down what @entity2 does and why @entity1 wanted it so badly			2
what is @entity2 ? based in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity2 ( rhymes with " octopus , " sort of ) is a young company founded by @entity33 , who designed its core product -- the @entity33 headset -- as a 20 - year - old engineer at the @entity38			1
in the hopes of raising $ 250,000 to make a few hundred headsets for diehard enthusiasts , @entity39 launched a @entity44 project in 2012			0
he hit that goal in four hours and within a month had raised nearly $ 2.5 million			0
early prototypes of the @entity33 soon drew raves at tech conferences			1
gaming legend @entity49 , the lead programmer of pioneering games like " @entity51 " and " @entity52 , " came aboard last year as @entity2 ' chief technology officer			2
and both @entity54 and @entity55 honored the @entity56 in 2013 as one of the top inventions of the year			0
developer versions of the headsets began rolling out to @entity44 backers and others last spring			0
a consumer version is expected sometime later this year			0
how does the @entity33 work ? the headset , which looks like something a skier or scuba diver might wear , fits snugly over the wearer 's face and is paired with headphones			1
a high - definition 3 - d display immerses you in an interactive world -- a medieval village , a tropical jungle , a jet 's cockpit -- which you navigate with the help of a game controller			2
the goggles come packed with an extra-wide field of view , accelerometer , gyroscope and compass to track the position of your head and sync the visuals to the direction where you are looking			0
this technology has allowed @entity2 to improve on the sometimes jerky visuals of other virtual - reality systems			1
those who have demoed the headset say it feels so real they have flinched involuntarily at perceived dangers			0
reviewers have been wildly enthusiastic , inspiring such breathless headlines as " @entity99 ca n't do justice to how awesome @entity101 is " and " i wore the @entity56 and i never want to look at @entity102			0
" why did @entity1 buy the company ? this is the big question			2
given the potential demand for the @entity33 when it hits the market , @entity1 may view @entity2 purely as a new stream of revenue			1
some observers suggest the purchase is an attempt to inject some futuristic cool into an aging social - media company that 's falling out of favor with young users			1
by buying @entity2 , @entity1 also is betting that the next tech wave could be ruled by wearable devices -- a similar path being trod by @entity120 , with its glass eyewear , and @entity122 , with its @entity124 smartwatch			2
" after games , we 're going to make @entity2 a platform for many other experiences , " said @entity18 in a post announcing the purchase			1
" imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game , studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face - to - face -- just by putting on goggles in your home			0
" this is really a new communication platform			1
by feeling truly present , you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life			0
imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online , but entire experiences and adventures			0
" the @entity33 , however , remains an immersive but isolating experience -- it 's not clear how @entity1 would integrate social functions into a @entity56 game , or whether users would even want that			1
how might @entity1 use @entity2 ? @entity2 believes that over the next 10 years , virtual reality will become ubiquitous and affordable			1
future technology could potentially allow two @entity2 wearers to interact with each other in a virtual world -- like @entity162 on steroids			2
" you start to realize how big this could be if you can see someone else , and you can actually look at them and your brain believes they 're right in front of you , not through a screen , " @entity2 ceo @entity164 told reporters in a conference call , as reported by @entity167			1
so , yes , the @entity33 might be a real - world step toward the " @entity179 " @entity176 , a chamber which can simulate any environment			2
instead of messaging your old college pals through @entity1 , why not meet them for a virtual hike through the @entity182 ? " you get the goosebumps , " @entity164 continued			0
" you see how big this could be , and how social it is , and the impact it could have on other industries			0
" still , however , some observers remain skeptical			0
" the real question is : does @entity18 actually believe that @entity1 's aging user base is going to be enthusiastic about the notion of a virtual social experience ? " wrote @entity193 for @entity194			1
" while i 'm sure that @entity1 would love to integrate virtual reality gaming and chats with doctors on the other side of the world into its platform , " @entity193 added , " could part of the calculus also be to hedge against the day that the era of the social network as we know it becomes totally played out ? " @entity1 's top 10 purchases			1

the company 's virtual - reality headset , the @entity33 , has gotten raves from reviewers
@entity18 sees the rift as a " new communication platform "
@entity2 ceo : " you start to realize how big this could be "
