-- so @entity1 thinks it 's the most stylish city on the planet ? sure , the @entity3 was named top dog in the latest rankings of fashion capitals around the world , pushing @entity8 into second place , and @entity10 into third			1
but can you party in an abandoned @entity14 mansion in @entity1 ? can you watch indie films in an antique @entity17 pagoda ? can you chillax on the beach in the heart of the city ? nope ? well , mes amis , you can in @entity8			1
whatever the world 's fashion dignitaries might say , the @entity8 is much more than stripy t - shirts and the @entity25			1
in fact , you 'd be hard pressed to find a single @entity8 jostling with the tourists atop that particular feat of architecture , says culture blogger @entity32			1
" @entity8 does n't have to be the crowded tourist city everybody thinks of , " said the 29 - year - old editor of @entity35 , a website delving into the city 's hidden artisan gems			1
" the great thing about @entity8 is you can walk around quiet , very traditional neighborhoods that are like movie sets , and find these secret little pockets -- like a hilltop vineyard overlooking the city			1
" and when the sun goes down , you can continue exploring the city 's sumptuous club scene -- if you know where to look			2
" people who complain about @entity8 nightlife are people who do n't get out much , " said 28 - year - old @entity51 who , along with 26 - year - old @entity52 , founded online city guide " ten days in @entity8			1
" " i feel as though there 's a real link between night clubs and art , the buildings are some of the most beautiful in the world			2
we have a much different clubbing culture than other @entity65 cities like @entity10 and @entity66 -- it 's smaller , more intimate			2
" @entity32 's top tip for discovering some of these tourist - free treasures ? " rent an old 1960s scooter , you do n't need a license , and it 's the best way to take the side streets and get lost			1
" and when you 've worked out how to find your way back again , here are a few more reasons why @entity8 is cooler -- if not always more fashionable -- than you think : you can party in an abandoned @entity14 mansion or a @entity80 bunker			1
or a closed inner - city railway			2
in fact , if it 's grand , vintage , and out - of - bounds , then event organizers " we are the @entity84 " ( @entity85 ) will probably be holding an extravagant soirée somewhere inside			0
expect " @entity92 " style secrecy , decadent dining , and thumping tunes -- all inside the city 's most magnificent derelict buildings			1
thousands of baguette - toting , beret - wearing cyclists take over as any hipster will tell you , retro is cool			0
artisan deli goods are definitely up there			0
so the " @entity104 " cycle ride through the city , involving 1,000 people dressed in 1930s costumes , and culminating in a picnic in the park , ticks all the right boxes			0
watch indie films in an antique @entity17 pagoda people who do n't know , watch films in multiplex cinemas			1
people who do , watch them in a lavish 118 - year - old @entity17 pagoda			0
the extravagant @entity118 was built as a present from @entity121 department store owner @entity120 as a gift to his wife			0
today , movie - goers can sip tea in the surrounding bamboo gardens before marveling at the elegant theater adorned with golden murals and chandeliers			0
@entity131 @entity130 ? @entity8 brings the beach to you let 's be realistic , not everyone has pockets deep enough for a vacation in the south of @entity131			1
never fear , @entity8 has it covered , bringing 5,000 tons of sand and nearly 100 palm trees to the banks of the @entity143 each summer			2
ok , so it 's not quite the @entity145			0
but there 's still volleyball , giant sprinklers , and live jazz -- and all within the heart of one of @entity65 's biggest cities			0
go hunting for a secret underground river but the @entity143 is n't @entity8 ' only river			2
there 's another secret stream flowing deep under the streets -- if you know where to look			0
centuries ago the @entity161 river wound its way through the city , becoming a polluted dumping ground for businesses , eventually sealed - up in 1912			0
today , walking tours follow plaques marking the hidden river route			0
you do n't need to go to the @entity171 to see amazing art you could line up for three hours to get into the world 's most visited museum			1
or you could wander the city at leisure , taking in some of the most skilful street art in @entity65			0
if you want to see more than just the usual @entity178 or pixelated mosaic " space invaders , " then there are plenty of walking or cycling tours to give you an in - depth tour of @entity8 ' more obscure murals			2

@entity8 is n't the most fashionable city in the world . but here 's why it 's the coolest
