-- the @entity1 is urging anyone who has used any product by the @entity4 to be vigilant for signs of meningitis , such as a headache or stiff neck			1
at least 233 people have become ill after receiving steroid injections made by the compounding center for back , neck and joint pain			1
fifteen of those sickened have died			2
on monday , the @entity1 announced that two more patients were sickened after other products made at the compounding center were used in heart and eye surgery			2
but there 's one problem for patients trying to take a proactive role in their health : the @entity4 was making more than 2,400 drugs and other products , and many patients would never know whether they received them			1
the list of @entity4 products ( @entity31 ) takes up more than 70 pages and includes many hospital staples , such as morphine and saline , which are often used in surgery when the patient would have been asleep			1
" it would be very difficult for a patient to sort this out , " said dr. @entity38 , an infectious disease specialist at @entity40 and a consultant to the @entity43 @entity42			0
even doctors would have a hard time knowing whether they used a @entity4 product on patients without doing an extensive search through patient records			1
the @entity1 warning applies to products made at the compounding center after may 21			2
the @entity1 does n't know how many people have received such products since that date , said @entity1 spokeswoman @entity59			2
" we understand that this is scary , " @entity60 said			0
@entity63 blamed for judge 's death the @entity1 has not released a list of hospitals and doctors who 've received @entity4 products			1
without that information , @entity38 said , it 's impossible for doctors to warn patients who might have been infected			0
" it 's puzzling the @entity1 has n't done that , " he said			0
he said it would be especially important to have a distribution list for the second steroid and the heart surgery drug , since those might be linked to new infections			1
" we want to get information out to patients and alert them , " he said			0
" but without more specific information and lot numbers , this @entity1 announcement is n't operationable			0
" @entity60 said the @entity1 is working on it			0
" this is an ongoing investigation , and we 're moving very quickly , " she said			0
" we just do n't have all the answers yet			0
" steroid injections common for patients with back pain @entity0 's @entity97 contributed to this report .			1
