-- what 's a blogger to do when his blog is in turmoil ? well , blog about it , of course			1
or , in the case of @entity10 's @entity9 , maybe " rant " is the more operative verb			1
on tuesday morning , the powerful , frothy - mouthed tech blog 's no. 2 man went off the digital rails , bemoaning a website that 's " on the precipice " and " may be over " as we , the @entity19 of the @entity20 , know it			1
" as soon as tomorrow , @entity23 may be thrown out of the company he founded , " he wrote , referring to @entity22 , who founded @entity10			1
" or he may not			2
and if he is , he will be replaced by -- well , again , no one knows			0
no one knows much of anything			0
certainly no one at @entity10			1
this site is about to change forever and we 're in the total f --- ing dark			0
" the controversy stems from @entity22 's recent decision to start a venture capital firm that would fund some of the companies his blog writes about			1
all of this happened out in the open , and @entity40 , which bought @entity10 last september , seemed fine with it at first , according to media accounts			1
it even invested in @entity22 's new $ 20 million venture , called @entity10			1
but journalists and other media outlets started lobbing criticism at @entity10 and @entity40 , saying it 's unethical for a guy who runs a blog as big as @entity10 to also control a massive pot of money that could help make or break the subjects of its articles			1
then @entity40 said @entity22 had stepped down from his post and could write for the site , but only as an unpaid blogger			2
@entity9 has plenty to say about all of this ( note : if you 're in @entity40 's human resources department , i think you 'll definitely want to keep reading ) : " @entity40 seems to think that by cutting off the biggest conflicts -- ones so big that they 'd obviously have to be disclosed -- that they 'll be a bastion of integrity in the editorial landscape , " he wrote			1
" what a bunch of horse s ---			0
the conflicts we need to worry about are the ones not disclosed			0
" @entity75 , a media critic at the @entity76 , does n't buy this argument , in part because millions of dollars are at stake			0
" @entity10 is capable of tearing the limbs off a baby company , but it 's been a generally nurturing place for start - ups when mr. @entity22 has skin in the game , " he wrote in a much - circulated column			1
@entity75 writes : " at this point , it seems that @entity40 executives would open up a lemonade stand in front of their headquarters if they thought it would help their bottom line			2
but the idea of a news site that covers every aspect of nascent tech companies sharing a brand name and founder with a venture capital firm financing these same companies seems almost comically over the line			1
" other journalists have defended @entity10 and @entity22			2
" @entity22 , remember , started @entity10 not as a journalistic venture but instead to gather and share information about startups and to promote himself as an investor			1
he is returning to his roots , " writes @entity107 , a journalism professor at the @entity108			0
@entity22 is n't trying to be an impartial journalist , @entity107 writes on his blog , @entity107			2
" he 's trying to get information , " he says			2
" he does it well			0
he has covered startups better than any big paper			0
" the @entity116 says the whole thing is " playing out like a @entity119 tragedy			0
" for his part , @entity9 thinks his blog can survive all this turmoil -- even without @entity22			2
but @entity10 wo n't be the same , he writes , since @entity22 's savvy and personality percolate through all of the website 's content			1
" could @entity10 survive without @entity22 ? probably			2
we 're doing so many pageviews now , and the machine is so profitable , that you can plug in other parts and it will run			0
but without him , it will not be the same			0
you might not think you 'll miss what he brings , but you will			0
quite often , you never even see what he brings			0
but it permeates the entire site			0
