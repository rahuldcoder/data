-- @entity1 , the visionary who led a mobile computer revolution with the creation of wildly popular devices such as the @entity5 , was mourned thursday by admirers and competitors as much of the world awoke to news of his death			1
@entity1 ' death was announced wednesday by @entity12 , the @entity13 company he co-founded with @entity14			1
" @entity12 has lost a visionary and creative genius , and the world has lost an amazing human being , " @entity12 said in a statement on its website			2
" those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with @entity14 have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor			2
" @entity24 : share your memories of @entity1 the hard - driving executive pioneered the concept of the personal computer and of navigating them by clicking onscreen images with a mouse			1
in more recent years , he introduced the @entity34 portable music player , the @entity5 and the @entity36 tablet -- all of which changed how digital content was consumed			2
live blog : reaction around the world more than one pundit , praising @entity1 ' ability to transform industries with his inventions , called him a modern - day @entity47			1
" @entity1 is one of the great innovators in the history of modern capitalism , " @entity50 columnist @entity49 said in august			1
" his intuition has been phenomenal over the years			0
" fortune : 10 ways @entity1 changed the world others championed his leadership skills			2
. " he was a historical figure on the scale of a @entity64 or a @entity65 , and set the mold for many other corporate leaders in many other industries , " wrote @entity60 , a tech columnist for @entity61			0
" he did what a ceo should : hired and inspired great people ; managed for the long term , not the quarter of the short - term stock price ; made big bets and took big risks			1
" @entity1 ' death , while dreaded by @entity12 's legions of fans , was not unexpected			1
he had battled cancer for years , took a medical leave from @entity12 in january and stepped down as chief executive in august because he could " no longer meet ( his ) duties and expectations			2
" the spiritual side of @entity1 born on february 24 , 1955 , and then adopted , @entity1 grew up in @entity87 , @entity88 -- which would become home to @entity12 's headquarters -- and showed an early interest in electronics			1
as a teenager , he phoned @entity95 , president of @entity96 , to request parts for a school project			0
he got them , along with an offer of a summer job at @entity96 @entity1 dropped out of @entity103 's @entity102 after one semester , although he returned to audit a class in calligraphy , which he says influenced @entity12 's graceful , minimalist aesthetic			1
he quit one of his first jobs , designing video games for @entity110 , to backpack across @entity111 and take psychedelic drugs			0
those experiences , @entity1 said later , shaped his creative vision			2
while at @entity96 , @entity1 befriended @entity14 , who impressed him with his skill at assembling electronic components			1
the two later joined a @entity13 computer hobbyists club , and when he was 21 , @entity1 teamed with @entity14 and two other men to launch @entity119 " it 's like there is a big hole left in you , " @entity14 said on @entity0 's @entity120 after learning of @entity1 death			1
" and it 's very hard to go back and ... reflect on the feelings ... and what it means			0
" timeline of career it 's long been @entity13 legend : @entity1 and @entity14 built their first commercial product , the @entity12 1 , in @entity1 ' parents ' garage in 1976			1
@entity1 sold his @entity139 van to help finance the venture			1
the primitive computer , priced at $ 666.66 , had no keyboard or display , and customers had to assemble it themselves			0
the following year , @entity12 unveiled the @entity12 computer at the inaugural @entity147			1
" @entity1 was , and still is , an inspiration to many individuals and companies all over the world			2
his passing is a loss to innovators and visionaries everywhere , " said @entity152 , president of @entity153			0
@entity159 ceo @entity158 described him as " one of the founders of our industry and a true visionary			0
" opinion : one thing we owe to @entity1 @entity1 was among the first computer engineers to recognize the appeal of the mouse and the graphical interface , which let users operate computers by clicking on images instead of writing text			1
@entity12 's pioneering @entity177 computer launched in early 1984 with a now - iconic , orwellian - themed @entity179 ad			1
the boxy beige @entity177 sold well , but the demanding @entity1 clashed frequently with colleagues , and in 1986 , he was ousted from @entity12 after a power struggle			1
then came a 10 - year hiatus during which he founded @entity184 , whose pricey , cube - shaped computer workstations never caught on with consumers			0
@entity1 had more success when he bought @entity188 from @entity189 before the company made it big with " @entity192			2
" in 1996 , @entity12 bought @entity184 , returning @entity1 to the then - struggling company he had co-founded			1
within a year , he was running @entity12 again -- older and perhaps wiser but no less of a perfectionist			2
and in 2001 , he took the stage to introduce the original @entity34 , the little white device that transformed portable music and kick - started @entity12 's furious comeback			2
thus began one of the most remarkable second acts in the history of business			0
over the next decade , @entity1 wowed launch - event audiences , and consumers , with one game - changing hit after another : @entity206 ( 2003 ) , the @entity5 ( 2007 ) , the @entity207 ( 2008 ) , and the @entity36 ( 2010 )			1
tears and tributes in @entity210 observers marveled at @entity1 ' skills as a pitchman , his ability to inspire godlike devotion among @entity12 " fanboys " ( and scorn from @entity219 fans ) and his " one more thing " surprise announcements			1
time after time , he sold people on a product they did n't know they needed until he invented it			2
and all this on an official annual salary of $ 1			0
he also built a reputation as a hard - driving , mercurial and sometimes difficult boss who oversaw almost every detail of @entity12 's products and rejected prototypes that did n't meet his exacting standards			0
by the late 2000s , his once - renegade tech company , the @entity234 to @entity159 's @entity235 , was entrenched at the uppermost tier of @entity238 business			0
opinion : how @entity1 saw the future @entity12 now operates more than 300 retail stores in 11 countries			1
the company has sold more than 275 million ipods , 100 million iphones and 25 million @entity36 worldwide			1
@entity1 ' climb to the top was complete in summer 2011 , when @entity12 listed more cash reserves than the @entity249 and even briefly surpassed @entity250 as the world 's most valuable company			1
but @entity1 ' health problems sometimes cast a shadow over his company 's success			2
in 2004 , he announced to his employees that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer			0
he lost weight and appeared unusually gaunt at keynote speeches to @entity12 developers , spurring concerns about his health and fluctuations in the company 's stock price			2
one wire service accidentally published @entity1 ' obituary			0
@entity1 had a secret liver transplant in 2009 in @entity270 during a six - month medical leave of absence from @entity12			1
he took another medical leave in january this year			0
perhaps mindful of his legacy , he cooperated on his first authorized biography , scheduled to be published by @entity276 in november			0
@entity1 is survived by his wife of 20 years , @entity278 , and four children , including one from a prior relationship			0
he always spoke with immense pride about what he and his engineers accomplished at @entity12			0
" your work is going to fill a large part of your life , and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work			0
and the only way to do great work is to love what you do , " he said while delivering a 2005 commencement address at @entity292			0
" if you have n't found it yet , keep looking			0
as with all matters of the heart , you 'll know when you find it			0
and , like any great relationship , it just gets better and better as the years roll on			0
" @entity0 's @entity301 contributed to this report .			0
