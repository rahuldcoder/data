@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the @entity4 of northern @entity1 , it 's not unusual to witness a shepherd guide his flock along a busy highway			1
this is @entity10 country after all , roughly two hours drive from the capital @entity12 and just a stone 's throw from the @entity16 border			1
these days , farmers on this land share tales of struggle			2
the arteries of their work , roads through @entity16 onto @entity21 , have been cut off by the vicious fighting amongst their northern neighbors			1
" it is difficult to go on with the business , " said @entity26 , a @entity1 wool distributor			1
" at the moment we ca n't do anything			2
we gather wool and stop until @entity34 can send us a buyer			0
" three years into @entity16 's civil war , these prayers have yet to be answered			1
many tons of sheep 's wool remains piled up in @entity26 's distribution yard rotting with no place to go			2
without safe passage through @entity16 the wool can not make it to market in @entity21			1
@entity1 say @entity47 farmers instead are filling the void in their stead			1
eventually , due to the cost of storage , those in @entity0 say their unexportable supply may have to be burned			0
" of course the @entity16 border is very important to us , " @entity53 continued			1
" it was the source of our income to @entity21 and we were pleased and there was business flow			1
" refugee crisis it 's not only along the border that frustrations are being felt			2
tribal leaders like @entity65 speak of @entity16 refugees now making up nearly one out of every four residents of nearby towns			1
this creates even more tensions for the work that is available			0
" the @entity16 took over so many jobs in the commercial sector , tailoring and farming , especially cheap wages , working 10 to 15 hours a day , " said @entity72			1
with little in the way of manufacturing in the rural areas , the government has encouraged vegetable farming			0
but with no certainty of getting goods through @entity16 and now @entity86 , buyers in the wealthier @entity85 states are looking elsewhere			1
farmers say they are fetching just one fifth the value of their tomatoes compared to the last two years			2
" this year it ( the tomato price ) changed completely to half a dinar ( $ 0.70 ) a kilo , " explained vegetable grower @entity90			0
" i do n't know what it will cover			0
the labor or insurance or spending on the farm or planting soil			0
it is expensive and it is ( a ) major negative impact on all farmers , " he added			2
state support agriculture is still a nascent industry here and growers complain there is no government help or a farming cooperative to help with distribution			0
@entity115 , a farm owner complained that " a farmer can not be a farmer and a supplier			0
there should be a market regulator that controls the production with the help of the government			0
" for @entity90 , such concerns lead him to question the wisdom of continuing to grow vegetables if he can not sell them			0
" we already have been affected so hard and we might not produce after this year			0
( there is ) no demand and all the money we consumed is such a waste			0
" with the government hindered by the rising cost of providing for refugees , the sought after financial relief is likely to remain in short supply .			2

farmers in @entity1 's @entity4 impacted heavily by conflict in @entity16
goods *previously* sent to to @entity21 via @entity16 now remain unused and *unsold*
*influx* of refugees has also *increased* tension with local *population*
