@entity1 , @entity0 -- couples in the @entity5 kingdom of @entity6 are being urged to get tested together as part of a hiv " love test " campaign			1
a couple discusses the love test with a @entity14 member			1
before the campaign , only 2 percent of couples got tested			2
the nationwide initiative -- funded by the @entity19 government and implemented by global charity ' @entity14 ' ( @entity14 ) -- is aimed at couples because tests can be useless if partners are not aware of the others ' hiv status			1
" if partners get tested separately , they may not disclose the results and not get the support they need , " @entity26 , spokesman for @entity6 , told @entity2			2
only one in four people -- mostly female -- know their @entity9 status despite the fact that approximately 26 percent of the population in @entity6 is @entity9 positive			1
the charity says it also wanted to move away from the traditional @entity9 campaigning methods			1
" we wanted to turn @entity9 on its head and move away from the fear - inducing campaigns we 've seen in the past , which do n't work			1
instead , we focus on love , saying that it is love that should be contagious and couples should get tested together , " @entity26 explained			2
would you get tested with your partner ? tell us in the soundoff below but in a country where a macho culture still prevails , getting couples tested together has proved challenging			0
@entity26 said : " in @entity6 it is difficult to convince men to get tested as it makes them feel inferior			2
" @entity14 said it found that one of the most successful campaigning tools has been to directly target men in areas where they are often concentrated			0
" we go to the places where men have their cattle disinfected and also work extensively in churches			0
we even have a testing facility in one of the countries ' prisons " said @entity61 , @entity14 's country director			0
watch @entity14 in action in @entity6 " men are the head of the family and we try to get them to own up to that responsibility			0
" @entity6 received $ 3 million this year from the @entity19 ' president 's @entity72 ( @entity72 ) and has so far spent $ 35,000 on radio , tv and print advertisements			0
since the launch of the campaign in april , @entity14 -- which partnered with @entity78 and @entity79 -- told @entity2 it has already seen a 25 percent increase in couple testing and a 400 percent in general testing year - on - year			0
and neighboring countries such as @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 have already shown interest in the ' love test			1
' the tests are also quick and free			0
offered in facilities in the four regions of the country , they take only 45 minutes , including a 30 - minute counseling session and on - the - spot results			0
if results show one or both partners are @entity9 positive , @entity14 offers longer - term free counseling			1
the @entity9 campaign is expected to last until the end of the year and the charity is also partnering with the @entity102 -- which has donated $ 50 million to fight aids in the region -- to promote male circumcision , medically proven to lower the risk of getting the hiv virus .			2

couples in @entity6 are being urged to get the @entity9 ' love test ' together
tests can be useless if partners are not aware of the others ' hiv status
