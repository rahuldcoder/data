-- i 've seen the future and it 's amazing			1
what i 'm about to describe has to be seen to be believed			1
no more tiny monitors and jerky pictures			2
telepresence is designed to capture the gestures and expressions of human communication			1
i 'd gone to the @entity12 offices of @entity13 to report on the latest innovation in the field of video conferencing , ' @entity7 '			1
my expectations were n't high , but what i saw was so exciting that i bored friends , family and colleagues with talk of it for days afterwards			2
imagine this -- a plush , soothingly lit and acoustically treated room containing what looks like an oval shaped meeting table and eight executive chairs			2
a man is seated on one side of the table and as i 'm ushered to a seat opposite he raises a hand in greeting and introduces himself			2
but as i adjust to my surroundings i begin to realize that all is not as it seems			0
the man on the opposite side of the table is in fact thousands of miles away in @entity44			0
what i 'm sitting at is , in fact , half a table pressed against three high - definition plasma screens			1
what i 'm seeing is an optical illusion			0
the clever positioning of cameras and microphones coupled with the high quality image and sound , plus the fact that there is no delay whatsoever makes it utterly convincing			0
i can see the hands on his wristwatch and the whites of his eyes			0
and he is seeing the same quality image of me in his almost identical room on the other side of the world			0
the effect is so convincing that i constantly have to remind myself that we 're not in the same room			0
see the ' @entity7 ' system in action , and hear more about the potential positive impact it will have on business and the environment in this month 's @entity79 .			1
