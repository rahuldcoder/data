-- i used to chuckle at people who complained about their glasses -- their thin , wispy glasses			1
but i was blind enough to be an honorary bat			1
in kindergarten , i got in trouble for constantly leaving my seat to approach the blackboard , but i could n't read it otherwise			1
coke - bottle glasses quickly followed			2
i graduated to contacts at age 10 ; by 30 , anything more than 3 inches past my nose was impossibly blurry without them			2
as with many who ca n't see without corrective lenses , i always carried bottles of eyedrops and saline solution			2
i fumbled for my glasses even to read the bedside clock			2
i spent hundreds of dollars on contacts each year			2
i love to travel , and i 'm also a worrier ( though i prefer the term " highly prepared " ) by nature			2
so i obsessed about contingencies : what if i have to sleep in the airport or i tear a contact in the dim light of a hotel bathroom ? what if i get a speck of sand under a contact and have to rinse my eye out ? i began to wonder what would happen if i were in an unfamiliar place -- say , asleep in a hotel -- and needed to get out quickly but could n't find my glasses			1
could i pick the correct shapes out of the odd blobs of color that made up the world ? it looked as if that was how life would always be , after i was rejected for @entity51 eye correction			1
my prescription was too high -- -9.5 diopters in one eye and -10 in the other , roughly equating to 20/1000 vision -- and my cornea too thin for the tissue removal required to correct my nearsightedness			2
i do n't mean to seem overly dramatic , as there are obviously many people who get along just fine with vision even worse than mine			2
but for me , it was enough of a daily interference that i was n't ready to accept it			2
i mentioned it almost offhandedly during an annual eye exam , and my ophthalmologist said he knew of something that might help			2
it 's a contact lens put in your eye -- not for the squeamish , i know			1
but the implantable lens , made by @entity73 , was approved by the @entity74 in 2005			1
it functions in a similar manner to an everyday contact lens , bending light rays so they focus correctly on the retina			1
but unlike a contact , this lens is inside the eyeball			1
the procedure was quick and simple			0
after my eye was numbed and dilated , i was given a sedative and wheeled into the operating room			0
i was awake for the procedure , but i remember only some bright lights			0
the doctor created a tiny slit in the cornea , the transparent front part of the eye , and inserted the slender , flexible device to form an arch over the existing lens			1
it 's made of @entity99 , an organic material , and the eye does n't recognize it as a foreign object			1
( a similar device approved by the @entity74 in 2004 goes over the iris , the colored part of the eye , rather than behind it			1
) " we have a great , great success rate with @entity115 , " said dr. @entity108 of @entity109 in @entity110 , who was among the first to perform the implantation surgery in the @entity112			0
" the amazing thing about it is that it does not require any corneal removal , and it 's reversible			0
" since @entity51 permanently alters the eye , any complications or changes in vision afterward can require even more treatment			0
the @entity126 lens can be switched out or removed at any time			1
@entity115 has been approved to correct nearsightedness from -3 diopters ( or roughly 20/300 vision ) up to -16 diopters and to treat patients up to -20 diopters			1
of course , the procedure is not without its risks			0
the medical drawback is that it 's done inside the eye , @entity108 said			1
" we do it usually one eye at a time ( with a delay of one or more days between surgeries ) because the risk is slightly higher for infection inside the eye and complications that could happen inside the eye			1
" besides cataracts , other complications such as glaucoma " can occur , he said			0
" these are very rare complications			0
" about 300,000 procedures have been performed worldwide			0
@entity154 's maker , @entity153 , says less than 1 % of patients experience complications			0
since the device has been in use for only about 10 years , little is known about long - term effects			0
some patients may still need reading glasses as their eyes go through the typical aging process			0
but perhaps the most daunting factor for most candidates is the cost of the procedure , which can be many times that of @entity51			0
it can run $ 10,000 or more			0
" the cost of the lens is high , " slightly less than $ 1,000 each , @entity108 said			1
" then you have to consider the cost of the surgical facility where you 're doing the surgery			0
and we do it one eye at a time , whereas @entity51 , we do both eyes in one sitting			0
so all these things add up to higher cost			0
" and unlike with @entity51 , very rarely do insurance companies pay for this procedure			1
three years after the procedure , my vision is 20/15 , better than ever			0
no more squinting at the bedside clock or toting contact lenses ( and all the accessories ) when i travel			1
for me , perfect vision is worth the price .			0
