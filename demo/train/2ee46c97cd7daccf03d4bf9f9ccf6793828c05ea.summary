-- @entity1 is once again top of golf 's world rankings and , on the evidence of his current form , the @entity5 is set for a long stay at the summit			1
two weeks after winning the @entity10 , @entity1 overhauled @entity12 's @entity11 to triumph at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 on sunday			1
the 25 - year - old posted a four - under - par final round of 66 to finish 15 under for the tournament , two strokes clear of @entity11 -- who tied for second behind @entity1 at @entity21 last month			2
@entity1 is now red - hot favorite to seal his fourth major crown at the @entity24 , which begins thursday at the @entity25 in @entity26			1
" it 's the most comfortable i 've ever felt trying to close out a golf tournament out there today , " he told the @entity28 's official website after eating up @entity11 's three - shot overnight lead in the final round at @entity31 , during which @entity32 withdrew with a recurrence of his back injury			1
" i felt normal , " @entity1 added			2
" i felt like it was the first round or the second round			0
it did n't feel like a fourth round			0
" his fortunes are in stark contrast to this time last year			0
a switch of equipment supplier coincided with a slump in performance which culminated with @entity1 enduring a torrid time at the 2013 @entity10 , where he failed to make the cut			1
fast forward 12 months and @entity1 has the @entity50 sat on his mantelpiece after successfully mastering his @entity53 clubs -- in particular his driver			2
he hit the ball further than any of his competitors over the four days of play at the @entity59 event , leading the field in driving distance with an average of 317 yards			1
" the big thing for me is if you let it affect you mentally , it makes it more difficult , " said @entity1 , reflecting on his difficult spell last year			0
" if you can stay strong mentally when you 're going through the struggles you always seem to come out the other side ok			0
" it 's when it affects you mentally you can start to lose confidence , then you 're losing confidence in your swing			0
it can spiral out of control , kind of like i did last summer			0
" @entity1 will be aiming to win the season 's final major for the second time in his career when the action tees off later this week			1
