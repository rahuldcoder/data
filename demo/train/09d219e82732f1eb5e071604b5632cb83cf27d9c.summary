-- it 's often proclaimed that " behind a strong man there is a strong woman " -- and in the case of @entity8 's prime minister and his wife , the saying seems to be true			1
@entity10 , the wife of @entity8 leader @entity11 , has been a champion for female rights in @entity8 for more than two decades now			1
a teacher by profession , @entity11 established a women 's voting league in 1991 and became known as the face of defiance during her country 's one - party regime			1
she is also one of the first women to head a major corporation in the @entity25 nation			2
" it 's good to be a wife , but it 's good to be an educated wife			1
being a wife , it 's just not a position of subordination -- it 's a position of strength , " she says			1
" and i make him [ @entity11 ] stronger by being strong			1
" @entity11 opened up to @entity0 's @entity36 about the role of women in @entity8 and her life as the wife of the country 's prime minister			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : what do you enjoy the most in your role as the wife of @entity8 's prime minister ? @entity10 : meeting with the people , particularly meeting with the young women in schools and colleges , i enjoy being with them			1
the most rewarding thing that i find is that when i go out in schools and in colleges , and i mentor the girls and i see how they respond to mentorship			0
i do n't only mentor the girls , i also mentor the girls , their parents and the community and i see the response			0
i find that really rewarding			0
@entity0 : what do you think is the changing role for women in @entity8 now ? @entity68 : women are taking up positions of responsibility , particularly in leadership -- political leadership , administrative leadership and all sorts of leadership			1
and that changing role is coming as a result of education			2
the other thing is that there is also a really large number of young bright women who are not able to pay school fees , who are not able to advance in education			1
and i look for means and ways to help them so that they can at least get the education			2

that does n't sound like the easiest business			0
how did you do this ? @entity68 : the work is different because it is heavy duty work but i do enjoy it , like teaching			0
in teaching you start with young girls and you take them and in the end they become young women			2
and you see the development , in the end you see the work , the result of your work			0
similarly , when you take raw materials and you cut it and you roll it and you weld it and you do this and in the end you see a beautiful cylinder standing on the other end , it is very rewarding			0
when you are satisfied with what you are doing and when you are in charge of what you are doing , you are powerful			2
and power is the nature of the game			0
the women must be powerful and they must remain strong			1
@entity0 : your husband spent most of the 1980s jailed by president @entity136 's government			1
how hard was it on you ? @entity68 : it was very hard on me -- at that time i had three children , my eldest was nine years old then i had a five - year - old and a three - year - old			2
now i was still a teacher in high school and i loved my job , i did it diligently and i enjoyed doing it			2
but then there were challenges because for all those years , i became like a political widow without a husband and my children had to go to school , they had to leave and so forth			2
i was not prepared to take care of the children alone and so this thing came to me as a surprise			2
but then i had to mature very quickly and know how to balance my life , how to be able to do my job and still bring up the children , single - handledly for those 10 years			2

it was never peaceful time			0
and in the process sometimes i would be arrested and thrown in the cell and remained there for a weekend			0
@entity0 : you 've said , " you must love yourself before someone else does			1
" what are you really trying to tell women ? @entity68 : when i say " you must love yourself before someone else does , " that 's self esteem			1
now if you love yourself , you want the best for yourself			0
you take care of your self and then others will see that and come and join you			0
do n't wait for someone to tell you how good you are , how strong , even how beautiful you are			0
you must know yourself that : " i 'm beautiful , i 'm knowledgeable , i 'm strong , i can do it ! join me to help me do it			0
" but do n't wait for somebody to tell you because when you wait for people to tell you , then they 'll take advantage of you because they 'll think that they 've made you			0
but make them understand that you make yourself			0
and after you 've made yourself , then others can come to join you to make you stronger			0
@entity0 : that does n't detract from being a fantastic wife , does it ? you can be both			1
@entity68 : it 's good to be a wife , but it 's good to be an educated wife			1
being a wife , it 's just not a position of subordination -- it 's a position of strength			1
and i 'd like to show them the best way to be a wife			0
you 're a wife , i 'm a wife of a prime minister and he loves me to death anyway			1
and i make him stronger by being strong .			0
