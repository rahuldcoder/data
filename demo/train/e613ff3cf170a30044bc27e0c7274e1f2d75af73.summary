-- in 2012 , @entity1 announced that in 2017 @entity2 could elect its chief executive through " universal suffrage			1
" previously , the leader of the @entity2 government was picked by an election committee of between 800 and 1,200 members , most of whom were trusted by @entity11			1
in effect , @entity11 had established procedures that ensured that a member of the territory 's establishment would be in charge			0
but @entity1 's 2012 promise created hopes among the public that the chief executive would be picked through a truly democratic election			1
those hopes have now been dashed , and it is likely that @entity1 has bought itself more instability , not less			2
@entity11 preserves control on august 31 , the @entity27 of the @entity28 announced a decision regarding the procedures for the next chief executive election			2
if the plan is actually passed , @entity2 will get universal suffrage in the narrow sense that eligible voters will be the ones to pick the chief executive , not an election committee			1
but @entity11 has preserved significant control by instituting a restrictive process for nominating candidates			0
it insisted that a nominating committee would pick candidates ( not political parties , and not by popular nomination )			1
and surprise , surprise : the nominating committee will be modeled on the old election committee			1
the new body would be composed mainly of people who are sympathetic to @entity11 's desire for order and who do n't want to see @entity2 's economic growth , in which many of the members are invested , disrupted by politics			0
in addition , over half of the nominating committee would have to approve each candidate , which means that no pan-democrat could get nominated if @entity11 disapproved of him or her			1
so under the plan @entity2 voters would have a choice , but the pro-democracy camp suspects that the choice will be among two or three like - minded and @entity11 - friendly candidates			1
will it be approved ? this new system is unlikely to be established because it must be approved by a two - thirds vote of @entity2 's legislature			0
if pro-democracy lawmakers stick together , they have enough votes to veto the scheme , in which case the selection procedure reverts to the prior , " small - circle " system			0
that would be a great tragedy			0
a sensible compromise was objectively possible -- one that democratized the nominating process in such a way that produced a competitive election and a clear choice between an establishment and pro-democracy candidate			2
that was an approach that would have likely commanded two - thirds approval			0
in the short - term , @entity2 faces the prospect of major disruption , because the more radical elements of the pan-democratic camp , which have insisted on nomination of candidates through citizen petition , have now promised to mount a campaign to " @entity105 , " the major business district , through large demonstrations and even civil disobedience			1
the radicals ' proposal was always unrealistic and not necessary to achieve a competitive election			0
the @entity2 police are perfectly capable of controlling the protests ( still , the @entity114 is waiting in reserve )			2
but whatever one thinks of @entity105 's goals and tactics , it has given voice to the more general public desire for genuine democracy and to frustration at @entity11 's rigidity			2
why invite trouble ? why did @entity1 choose this course of action ? first of all , it has feared that if pan-democrats ran the @entity2 government , they would use it as a base to destabilize @entity132 rule in the rest of @entity1			1
second , it believed that the @entity134 and @entity135 were manipulating the pan-democrats to further their own disruptive goals			0
( both fears have no basis in reality , but what counts is that @entity11 believes them )			0
third , the @entity1 government and the @entity2 tycoons it listens to worried that a democratic election would increase demands for costly social welfare programs			1
fourth , there was the prospect of continued disruption if @entity2 radicals concluded that @entity11 would always back down in the face of mass protest			0
finally , @entity1 leaders may have worried that granting genuine democracy to @entity2 would stimulate similar demands in @entity1			2
problems compounded ? in the end , @entity11 opted for the certainty of knowing that it could control @entity2 's leadership by controlling the nomination process for the chief executive election			2
it will likely achieve that goal , but the price will be continuing instability from a frustrated public			1
true universal suffrage would not have solved all of the governance problems of what is becoming a more unequal and polarized society			0
but without genuine elections to legitimize @entity2 's leaders , solving those problems will be impossible .			0

@entity1 has announced changes to election procedures in @entity2
new " nominating committee " rules would likely see @entity184 candidates elected
pro-democracy campaigners in @entity2 are angry , " @entity105 " protests planned
@entity189 : result of changes will be " continuing instability from a frustrated public "
