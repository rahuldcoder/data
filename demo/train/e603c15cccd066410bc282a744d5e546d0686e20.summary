@entity0 , @entity1 -- concern about the possibility of broader war in the @entity6 grew monday after reported airstrikes on @entity1 military installations			1
the reported strikes killed 42 @entity1 soldiers , the opposition @entity9 said monday , citing medical sources			1
it said 100 people remained missing			0
the @entity1 government warned sunday 's apparent strikes -- which followed one last week that @entity1 also blames on @entity17 -- " opens the door wide for all the possibilities			1
" @entity1 ally @entity20 warned of a " crushing response " while @entity22 called reports of @entity17 involvement " very worrying			1
" but an @entity17 general who commands forces on the @entity1 border said " there are no winds of war , " according to the @entity29 website			1
the heightened tensions come amid questions over possible chemical weapon use in @entity1 and international debate over how to respond to the country 's bloody civil war , in which more than 70,000 people have died in more than two years of fighting			2
on monday , a @entity42 official spoke of strong suspicions that rebels , not @entity1 government forces , have used chemical weapons			1
details of reported strikes @entity1 claimed @entity17 missiles struck at its military facilities on sunday			1
according to the state - run @entity52 news agency , @entity17 missiles struck a research center in @entity55 , a facility in @entity57 and what the news agency described as a " paragliding airport " near @entity0			2
" the @entity17 terrorist aggressions on the @entity1 territories have left no room for hesitation , weakness , self - dissociation or silence as @entity1 would not forgive us all if we hesitated in defending it , " @entity52 reported @entity1 prime minister @entity61 as saying			1
the blasts prompted terrified residents nearby to run for cover			0
" everything kept exploding over and over again , " said @entity73 , whose family lives just over a mile away			0
" we could hear gunshots , we could hear people screaming			0
... we did n't know what to do , and there was a problem with us breathing because the smoke was too much			0
" @entity1 says the attack followed another @entity17 airstrike late last week			1
@entity17 has not confirmed or denied that its forces were involved in any attacks inside @entity1 , but a @entity87 official told @entity2 's @entity88 on monday that @entity17 forces conducted sunday 's strike , as well as one last week			1
sunday 's strike targeted a research facility in a mountainous area near @entity0 and weapons that were to be transferred to @entity95 , according to the source			0
the earlier strike , which @entity87 officials had previously said happened thursday or friday , targeted @entity102 missiles stored at the @entity0 airport , the source said			2
@entity52 reported that the allegation of weapons transfers was false			0
and @entity1 deputy foreign minister @entity106 told @entity2 the attacks amount to a declaration of war by @entity17			1
" the details are not clear on what happened , " @entity106 told @entity2			2
" did they fire missiles ? ... it is not clear for me , because i do n't know how it happened , and of course it is worrying , but @entity17 will suffer the same			1
" ' watching everything ' while @entity17 has not acknowledged responsibility for the attacks , the country has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to @entity95 or other terrorist groups			2
" we are watching everything when it comes to the movement of these types of weapons			0
we have the means to do that , " a senior @entity17 defense official told @entity2 's @entity132 on sunday			1
the official is not authorized to speak to the media			0
@entity137 , a lawmaker in @entity17 's @entity138 , told @entity139 on sunday that @entity17 is n't meddling with @entity1 's civil war			1
but @entity17 must protect itself from @entity142 militants , he said			2
" for @entity17 , it is very important that the front group for @entity20 , which is in @entity142 , needs to be stopped , " @entity137 said			2
international response @entity95 did not immediately comment after sunday 's claims			0
@entity20 said it will stand by @entity1 , " and if there is need for training , we will provide them with necessary training , " brig			2
gen. @entity154 , commander of the @entity156 's @entity155 , told reporters sunday			0
@entity20 @entity162 spokesman @entity161 said he had no doubt @entity1 and its allies will " give a crushing response to the aggressions of the @entity166 , " the state - run @entity159 news agency reported			1
@entity22 also weighed in monday , with a @entity162 spokesman calling the reports of @entity17 strikes " very worrying			1
" " any intensification of military confrontation greatly increases the risks of creating hotbeds of tension aside from @entity1 , in @entity142 , and also destabilizing the @entity17 - @entity142 border , which has so far remained relatively calm , " ministry spokesman @entity171 said monday			1
but @entity17 maj. gen. @entity178 indicated war is not imminent , according to the @entity29 's website			2
" there are no winds of war , " said @entity178 , who is in charge of the @entity182			0
two rockets fired from inside @entity1 fell into the @entity186 , the @entity29 said in a tweet			2
the military said the rockets were " fired erroneously as a byproduct of internal conflict in @entity1			2
" @entity193 secretary general @entity192 told reporters monday that the alliance had no information on the reported airstrikes , but said the alliance remains concerned about the possibility that the conflict could spread beyond @entity1 's borders			1
" it 's not a new concern that for quite some time we have expressed concerned of the risk of spillover of this conflict , " he said			0
chemical weapons reports the tensions have been worsened by conflicting reports on the possible use of chemical weapons in @entity1			1
on monday , a @entity42 official said evidence points to the use of the deadly nerve agent sarin by @entity1 rebel forces			1
@entity219 told an @entity222 - @entity221 tv station that the findings come after interviews with doctors and @entity1 victims now in neighboring countries			2
@entity228 , the commissioner of the @entity229 for @entity1 , said the notion is n't surprising , given the infiltration of foreign fighters into the @entity1 opposition			2
later , the commission issued a press release saying it " has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in @entity1 by any parties to the conflict			2
" therefore , " the commission is not in a position to further comment on the allegations at this time , " the statement said			0
the @entity245 released a statement in response to @entity228 's comments , condemning the use of chemical weapons and stressing that it will continue to conduct its own investigations			0
" the @entity245 will take all necessary legal measures in case the investigation reveals parties other than @entity257 's regime have used chemical weapons , " it said			0
a @entity260 official told @entity2 that the @entity87 does not have information suggesting that rebels have " either the capability or the intent to deploy or use such weapons			1
" but , the source said , the " facts are not complete " and efforts to obtain more information are ongoing			0
rebel @entity271 spokesman @entity270 said rebels do n't have unconventional weapons , nor do they want any			0
" in any case , we do n't have the mechanism to launch these kinds of weapons , which would need missiles that can carry chemical warheads , and we in the @entity271 do not possess these kind of capabilities , " @entity270 said			0
" more importantly , we do not aspire to have ( chemical weapons ) because we view our battle with the regime as a battle for the establishment of a free democratic state			0
... we want to build a free democratic state that recognizes and abides by all international accords and agreements -- and chemical and biological warfare is something forbidden legally and internationally			0
" intelligence claims the claim of rebels using sarin gas comes after months of suspicions that the @entity1 regime has used the same nerve agent against rebels			1
last week , the @entity87 said its intelligence analysts had concluded " with varying degrees of confidence " that chemical weapons had been used in @entity1 and that the regime of president @entity257 was the likely culprit			1
in april , the head of @entity17 military 's intelligence research said the @entity1 government is using chemical weapons against rebel forces			1
" in all likelihood they used sarin gas , " @entity316			0
the @entity271 's chief of staff has also said the @entity1 regime has used sarin in cities such as @entity321 , @entity322 and @entity323 , outside @entity0			1
" we took some samples of the soil and of blood			0
the injured people were observed by doctors , and the samples were tested , and it was very clear that the regime used chemical weapons , " gen. @entity328 told @entity2 's @entity329 last month			0
@entity336 gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless , odorless and tasteless			0
but it can cause severe injuries to those exposed to it , including blurred vision , convulsions , paralysis and death			0
why @entity1 matters the @entity1 civil war has pitted rebel fighters against the regime run by @entity257 , whose family has ruled the country for four decades			2
@entity1 matters to @entity20 because it is believed to be the main conduit to the @entity352 militia @entity95 in @entity142 , the proxy through which @entity20 can threaten @entity17 with an arsenal of short - range missiles			1
in 2009 , the top @entity87 diplomat in @entity0 disclosed that @entity1 had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to @entity95 , according to official cables leaked to and published by @entity360			1
the last thing @entity20 wants is a @entity362 - dominated @entity1 -- especially as the @entity1 rebels ' main supporters are @entity20 's @entity366 rivals : @entity367 and @entity368			0
@entity95 's feared scenario is @entity17 on one side and a hostile @entity362 - led @entity1 on the other			1
@entity2 's @entity372 reported from @entity0 ; @entity132 reported from @entity373 ; and @entity374 reported from @entity375			0
@entity2 's @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity380 , @entity381 and @entity382 contributed to this report .			0
