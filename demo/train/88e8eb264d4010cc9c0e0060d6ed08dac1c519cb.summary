@entity0 -- @entity3 's death became a controversy at the @entity6 wrongful death trial as a man who promoted both artists ' last tours testified			1
@entity11 co-ceo @entity10 testified wednesday that @entity3 died of a drug overdose , but when his own lawyer questioned him thursday he changed his testimony to say @entity3 died of a heart ailment			1
@entity3 collapsed in the bathroom of his @entity18 , mansion -- @entity19 -- on august 16 , 1977 , at the age of 42			0
while his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat , the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem			0
how @entity3 died is relevant because @entity6 lawyers argue @entity10 's experience as @entity3 's promoter should have made him more aware of drug abuse by artists , including @entity6			1
he was in charge of producing @entity6 's " @entity36 " concert when @entity6 died on june 25 , 2009 , at the age of 50			2
the coroner ruled his death was caused by a fatal combination of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol			0
dr. @entity42 told investigators he gave @entity6 nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia			0
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter , sentenced to four years in prison			0
promoter grilled about ' smoking gun ' e-mail in trial @entity6 's mother and children are suing @entity11 , contending the concert promoter is liable in his death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity42			1
@entity11 lawyers argue their executives had no way of knowing -- or reason to suspect -- that @entity6 was abusing drugs as he prepared for the " @entity36 " concerts they were promoting and producing			1
" i had no idea " @entity6 was using propofol in the weeks before his death , @entity10 testified			1
although he worked advance promotion on @entity3 's last tours -- under the direction of @entity3 manager colonel @entity68 -- @entity10 testified he never met @entity3			1
" did you understand he had a problem with drugs ? " @entity11 lawyer @entity72 asked			2
" i understood that later , " @entity10 said			0
" there was a period of time when we did n't work			0
i did n't understand at the time , but i learned that it was a drug problem and the @entity68 said he could n't work			0
" @entity6 lawyer @entity78 confronted @entity10 with two e-mails he sent two weeks after @entity6 's death in response to condolence messages from friends			1
they both read : " i was working on the @entity3 tour when he died so i kind of knew what to expect			0
" but under questioning from @entity88 , @entity10 said he did n't mean that he expected @entity6 to die like @entity3			1
he was referring to the trauma of people losing their jobs because a tour is canceled , he said			0
promoter : ' i kind of knew what was going to happen ' to @entity6 ' i do n't recall ' @entity11 's lawyer tried to rehabilitate @entity10 's credibility with jurors , who sometimes laughed at his repetition of " i do n't recall " several dozen times under questioning by @entity78			1
after the jury left the courtroom wednesday , @entity103 judge @entity102 commented on the number of " i do n't recall " responses			1
" we 've had a lot of that , " she said			0
" how much more of that ? " " why could you not recall e-mails ? " @entity72 asked him thursday			0
" i had not reviewed them and had not seen them in years , " @entity10 answered			0
some of the e-mails were new to him because he was so busy putting @entity6 's tour together that he never read them , he said			2
" mostly , it was just a time factor if it was something that did n't have to do with me			0
" outside of court , @entity78 suggested it was @entity72 's job as @entity10 's lawyer to prepare him by having him review e-mails before questioning			1
@entity1 exclusively obtained video of @entity129 's deposition recorded in december and played this week for jurors			0
@entity10 struggled in the deposition when @entity78 asked him about the e-mail @entity6 lawyers call their " smoking gun " -- because it contradicts @entity11 's argument that they never hired or supervised dr. @entity42			1
they say @entity10 's e-mail , sent 11 days before @entity6 's death , shows @entity11 executives used @entity42 's fear of losing his lucrative job as @entity6 's personal physician to pressure him to have @entity6 ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health			1
it was @entity10 's reply to an e-mail from show director @entity151 expressing concerns that @entity42 had kept @entity6 from a rehearsal the day before			1
@entity151 also raised his own concerns about @entity6 's health			2
" we want to remind ( @entity42 ) that it is @entity11 , not @entity6 , who is paying his salary			2
we want to remind him what is expected of him , " @entity10 wrote			1
but in his video deposition he said he could not remember writing it			0
after conceding that he wrote it , @entity10 then seemed unable to explain what he meant by the e-mail			2
@entity11 exec called @entity6 ' freak ' before signing concert contract " he needs cheeseburgers " @entity11 's production manager for @entity6 's tour e-mailed @entity172 10 days before @entity6 's death that perhaps what the singer needed to turn around his deteriorating health was to be feed some junk food : " he needs some cheeseburgers with a bunch of @entity181 cheesehead bowlers ... and a couple of brats and beers			1
" @entity186 wrote a more serious assessment of @entity6 's condition four days later : " i have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks			2
he was able to do multiple 360 spins back in april			0
he 'd fall on his ass if he tried now			0
" @entity10 testified that he disagreed with @entity186 's opinion , saying he had no " particular concern " about @entity6 's health and ability to perform			1
@entity6 looked ' skeletal ' @entity11 president @entity11 sent @entity10 an e-mail after @entity6 's death to make sure he did not use certain rehearsal video in the " @entity36 " documentary because it made @entity6 look too thin : " make sure we take out the shots of @entity6 in that red leather jacket at the soundstage where the mini-movies were being filmed			1
he looked way too thin and skeletal			0
" @entity10 testified that he did not know why @entity207 would ask that			0
" we did n't keep anything out based on what @entity11 wanted			2
" another e-mail suggested @entity10 was concerned that musicians , dancers and singers who worked on the show might tell interviewers after @entity6 's death that he was unhealthy at rehearsals			1
" the only thing we ask is that they keep it positive and stress that @entity6 was active , engaged , and not the emaciated person some want to paint him as being , " he wrote in an e-mail approving their interviews			2
@entity10 is expected to remain on the witness stand through monday .			2

@entity227 promoted last tours of @entity3 and @entity6
@entity6 lawyers say his experience with @entity3 should 've prepared him for @entity6
