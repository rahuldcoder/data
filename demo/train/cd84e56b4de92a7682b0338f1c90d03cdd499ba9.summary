@entity0 , @entity1 -- " this is ground control to @entity4 , " sang @entity5 about a fictional astronaut lost in orbit in 1969			0
now , 40 years later @entity5 's son @entity8 has released his own space oddity			1
@entity10 plays a moon worker nearing the end of his contract with @entity14 which mines precious gas , @entity17			1
@entity8 ' debut feature " @entity19 " is a thoughtful , stylish sci - fi thriller set in the near future amid the monochromatic wastelands of @entity24 's closest satellite			1
it is a contemplative character - driven piece of filmmaking that is particularly smart and accomplished because @entity8 has managed to create the film 's universe with next to no money			1
but then , " @entity19 " is n't your average sci - fi : stylistically , it 's very different from the big budget , spectacle - driven science fiction being made by @entity37 studios today			1
with a storyline about alienation rather than aliens , this retro delight is peppered with references to 20 - year - old classics like @entity45 's " @entity44 " and cult films like " @entity47 , " starring @entity48			1
it includes an inspired turn by @entity51 as computer @entity19 , whose automaton voice bears a creepy resemblance to @entity55 , the ruthless computer in @entity58 's seminal space opera , " 2001 : a @entity59			1
" " we wear our references on our sleeve , " @entity8 , whose mother is @entity5 's first wife , @entity60 , told @entity2			1
" it is a period of science fiction we are both huge fans of and we miss that kind of film			0
" his partner and inspiration in this project is quirky actor @entity10 who he was determined would take the lead in his debut feature			1
@entity10 plays @entity73 , a moon worker nearing the end of his contract with @entity14 which mines @entity17 , the precious gas thought to be the solution to @entity24 's energy crisis			1
" in some ways we worked backwards , " says the 38 - year - old who met @entity10 to discuss another film that did n't work out			2
" the very first thing i knew was that @entity10 was going to star			2
" i knew i wanted to work with him because he 's just so talented , and he also just happens to be such a nice guy			0
" i said , ' look , i really want to work with you			0
i really want you to be in my first film			0
let me go away and write something for you			0
' " the pair discovered a shared love of science fiction films from the late 1970s and early 1980s , like " @entity92 " starring @entity93			0
" real , character - driven stories about working class , blue - collar people working and living in space , " explains @entity8			2
this was the seed of @entity8 ' screenplay and the moon seemed the obvious place to set it			2
" everyone has a relationship with the moon but at the same time it remains so mysterious			0
we may have been there , but only briefly			0
" nine months later @entity8 had worked up a script and , with his leading man secured , he had to come up with a plan for how to make a traditionally pricey sci - fi on a budget of $ 5 million			1
" it was a challenge , " @entity8 acknowledges			2
" science fiction by its nature is very expensive because you have to build everything ; you have to build the entire universe that our film takes place in			0
" if there 's anything in shot , you 're probably going to have to have it designed and built and then there 's special effects on top of that			0
" to keep costs down , @entity8 used model miniatures for the exterior shots of the moon base and the lunar buggy that @entity73 drives across the cold regolith to tend to the monstrous @entity17 harvesting machines traversing the planet			1
he shot the entire film in a studio and on a sound stage at @entity142 , near @entity0 , @entity1 , which allowed them to completely control the environment			0
all of @entity8 ' ideas in the film are based on what could be fact in the near future			2
much of his inspiration came from a book by @entity153 aerospace engineer and manned @entity155 exploration advocate , @entity149 called " @entity156 : creating a @entity157			0
" one of the chapters in @entity149 's theoretical guide to expanding human settlement across the solar system was about setting up a @entity17 mining facility on the moon			1
" it always stuck in my head as a really interesting idea , " says @entity8			2
" hard science fiction , science fiction that builds out of scientific potential or extrapolating from what 's possible -- that 's the science fiction i find most interesting			0
" " @entity19 " was screened on request at the @entity172 , where they are doing research into @entity17 mining			1
the researchers quizzed him on his moon base design choices and discussed their research , including " mooncrete , " a special concrete made of lunar rock and water from the moon 's polar caps			0
@entity8 will continue to mine the rich seam of classic science fiction in his next film , " @entity189			0
" he has likened it to a @entity192 - based version of " @entity193 , " @entity45 's bleak vision of a future @entity195			1
he hopes to replicate the success of " @entity19 " which won @entity197 at this year 's @entity198 : " what we 're finding now is that there is a real interest and hunger for this kind of film			2
