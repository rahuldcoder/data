@entity0 has come to the @entity1 -- first in the form of sick @entity1 brought home for treatment , now with one confirmed case in @entity6 and others being monitored -- and public concern over that reality includes a pointed question : who 's in charge of stopping @entity0 before it can spread ? the global threat of the deadly virus is so serious that on friday , vice president @entity16 likened @entity0 to the brutal @entity18 fighters in @entity19 and @entity20 : together , they 're " the wolves closest to the door , " @entity16 said			1
a series of events has unfolded since a visiting @entity27 citizen in @entity28 became the first - ever @entity0 case diagnosed in the @entity1 this week : 50 more people in @entity6 are being monitored for the disease			1
officials struggle to clean a contaminated apartment there			2
and a patient in @entity36 , who recently visited @entity37 was hospitalized friday and was being monitored for health issues that could be associated with @entity0			1
so , who 's in charge of the battle against @entity0 ? it 's a partnership between the federal @entity43 , and state and local governments where an @entity0 case occurs , said @entity43 director @entity47			1
but local officials ultimately are in charge of each case , he said			1
" we work very closely with state and local governments , and when there 's an episode in a state or local government , they are in charge , and we support them in every way , " @entity47 told @entity51 on friday			1
" they assign an incident manager			0
they establish an emergency operations system			0
they outline every aspect and we work very closely ... there 's a great collaboration , " @entity47 added			0
in the @entity0 case in @entity6 , authorities at the state , county and city levels are working with the @entity43			1
specifically , it 's @entity76 that 's in charge , said @entity76 judge @entity79 , also director of the county 's @entity80 and @entity82			2
the county has " set up an @entity86 and is acting as the lead agency for the @entity0 investigation and containment , " said the county judge , who is vested with broad judicial and administrative powers under the @entity85			1
have there been any government snafus ? yes			0
not surprisingly , there 's bureaucratic red tape that has slowed government response to @entity28 ' @entity0 case and its attendant concerns			1
for example , the @entity43 sent a medical waste contractor to a @entity6 apartment where @entity0 patient @entity101 , 42 , had stayed and where his sweat - stained bed sheets and towels were still inside the unit			1
in fact , the days - long presence of the contaminated linens in the apartment was a controversy in itself			0
@entity101 's partner , by whom he has a child and whose first name is @entity113 , told @entity51 about how she and three family members were being forced to live with the soiled materials since sunday , when an ambulance took an ill @entity101 to the hospital			0
@entity113 and the three relatives are in the apartment under a quarantine enforced by police			0
but the medical waste contractor could n't begin the job thursday because a @entity126 permit was needed to transport this type of unprecedented hazardous waste on @entity28 highways , a @entity43 spokeswoman said			2
by midday friday , the contractor began cleaning the apartment			0
dr. @entity132 , director of the @entity133 , acknowledged " there are things that did n't go right in @entity6 " but added many responses went well too			2
" even though there were missteps there , there were good things that happened , " @entity132 said friday			0
has there been criticism ? yes , largely from @entity144			2
even before the first case on @entity1 soil , @entity1 sen. @entity145 , @entity146 , urged president @entity149 , a @entity150 , to appoint one federal official to lead the @entity1 strategy to address the worldwide @entity0 outbreak , especially in @entity154			1
" unfortunately , the lack of a central coordinator to facilitate cooperation between all of the @entity1 efforts at home and abroad appears to have led to a delay in an effective @entity1 government response and an absence of financial and operational accountability , " @entity145 wrote to @entity149 last month			1
this week , another @entity144 , sen. @entity164 of @entity165 , urged @entity149 to appoint to an " ebola czar " to address the outbreak in @entity154 , @entity164 told @entity168			1
@entity164 , however , did n't make any reference to the ongoing @entity28 situation			0
" there is no person to go to , to tell us how all this is going to be funded , " @entity164 said of the @entity1 response to the @entity0 outbreak in @entity154			1
" i do n't think there is a person in charge , " he added			2
" and i do n't think there is a plan internationally to bring the folks together to combat this			0
" for its part , the @entity185 has set up the first - ever @entity185 emergency health mission , the @entity188 , to deal with the " the unprecedented outbreak " of @entity0 , the agency said			2
what does @entity149 say about a @entity1 ebola czar ? no. @entity149 does n't want one			1
the @entity192 said the structure of the federal response is " sufficient , " with particular officials leading the way on both domestic and international fronts			1
" on the question of why we have not tapped an ' ebola czar , ' we are cognizant that doing so would create another layer of bureaucracy , " a senior administration official said			0
" to be sure , our response needs to be as nimble and as bureaucratically lean as possible in order to bring the overseas epidemic under control , " the official said			0
" we feel the current structure we have in place is sufficient			0
" on friday , @entity211 , @entity149 's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser , said the @entity1 government has been " enhancing our domestic preparedness to respond " to cases like @entity28			1
" the @entity1 has the most capable health care infrastructure and the best doctors in the world , bar none , " @entity211 said			2
" the @entity1 is prepared to deal with this crisis , both at home and in the region			2
every @entity0 outbreak over the past 40 years has been stopped			2
" @entity43 director @entity47 applauded the @entity1 domestic response and cited how @entity28 has successfully established an incident management system			1
" that 's been done in @entity28			0
they 've done exactly what we 've recommended			0
they have an incident manager in place			0
we 're supporting that person			0
the state of @entity28 is supporting that person , and i 'm confident we 'll break the chain of transmission there , " @entity47 said .			0

local officials ultimately are in charge of each @entity1 @entity0 case , @entity43 says
but there have been problems between governmental units in the @entity6 case
some @entity144 senators urge @entity149 to appoint an @entity0 czar
but the @entity192 says no , stating that the leadership is sufficient
