-- @entity1 and @entity2 of @entity3 , @entity4 , faced a sudden financial quandary one evening			0
their 5 - year - old , @entity6 , had just lost his first tooth , and the @entity9 realized they did n't know the @entity11 's going rate			1
@entity12 was overjoyed to get $ 5 from the @entity11 : he 'd expected a quarter			1
" my husband was like , ' maybe we should give him a twenty ? ' and i said , ' no ! i used to get a quarter ! ' " says @entity15 , 32 , a publicist			0
they settled on $ 5 , only to find their son in hysterics the next morning last december			2
" he flipped his lid ! he 's like , ' i thought the @entity11 only gave quarters ! i 'm going to be rich ! ' " she says			1
" so then we had to backpedal			0
we said , ' well , um , she probably does normally give just a quarter , but this was because it was your first tooth			2
" call it the @entity11 conundrum			2
when a child puts a tooth under her pillow , there 's a good chance her parents are in the next room scrounging through their wallets and scratching their heads			1
and for divorced parents , @entity38 run the risk of doubling up or making each other look stingy			0
pre-emptive negotiation is key , says @entity44 book editor @entity43 , 32 , father of 6 - year - old @entity45			0
" when the first tooth came out , my ex-wife was out of town , but i called her husband so we could decide together how much to pay for each tooth , " says @entity43			0
" we decided it 'll depend on tooth size			0
" a quarter does n't cut it at a time when it 's common for middle - class kids to receive pricey video game consoles and mp3 players as gifts , some families worry that a few quarters or even a dollar just wo n't be special enough to match their child 's excitement over that gap in his mouth			1
they also fear too much money could teach children that , in life , making bank is as easy as losing a tooth			1
@entity74 , founder of @entity75 , likes the idea of using the experience to introduce the concepts of money and value			0
parents , she says , can use the loot from that first visit to show a child how to divide up money for spending , saving and charity			1
but she cautions against giving too much			0
" in general , i think people are overspending on their children , and that 's part of the reason why the generation coming up does n't have a great work ethic			0
" according to a 2006 survey of 150 mothers conducted by @entity97 , an online toy store , the @entity11 is giving an average of $ 2.64 , with 60 percent of respondents reporting that they give less than $ 3 per tooth			1
stray too far above the average and you 're bound to frustrate some other parents on the block			0
" if one kid gets $ 20 and tells the kids at school , then other kids go home and are upset they got less , " says dr. @entity105 , a pediatric dentist in @entity106 , @entity107			1
she tries to keep the peace on the playground by dropping hints for parents during routine visits : " when a kid says they 've gotten $ 20 , i 'll say , ' wow , you must 've been the only kid to lose a tooth that night , because usually she only brings one dollar			1
' " however , those who stray too far below the average -- or , at least , below their child 's expectations -- might find they have some explaining to do			2
valuable lessons when his youngest son asked why he got $ 2 when some other kids at his @entity132 school got $ 20 , branding specialist @entity127 decided to make it a business lesson			1
" i told him it was actually a franchise , and that we were in a $ 2 territory			1
my wife did all she could to keep a straight face , " says @entity127 , 50			0
" i was like , ' do you know what a franchise is ? well , @entity143 's does n't actually own each @entity143 's ... ' " @entity144 , 39 , a publicist in @entity145 , @entity146 , also turned the event into a kind of @entity149			2
two years ago , his son @entity150 , then 6 , announced that he wanted the cash the @entity11 would give him for his first tooth , but he was n't ready to part with the pearly gem			1
" so i said i 'd buy the tooth for him for $ 1 and would keep in a drawer so he could visit it , " says @entity154			2
" but it turns out that the conventional wisdom among first - graders was that the @entity11 gives $ 2			1
so he had to figure out what the value of the tooth was to him			0
was it worth an extra dollar if it meant losing access to the tooth ? or was it better to have a little bit of money and visiting rights ? " in the end , @entity150 went with the latter option			1
" i liked his decision process , " @entity154 says			0
" and i like that i 'm getting a better rate than the @entity11			2

child takes half price to gain toothy visiting rights
