-- investigators have pinpointed two men as " possible suspects " who were seen in images near the finish line of this week 's @entity7 -- moments before twin bombs there exploded , killing three and injuring about 180 others -- a law enforcement official said			1
a circular sent out wednesday to federal and state agencies features the photos " in an attempt to identify the individuals , " who were described as being of " high interest " to investigators			1
one of the men is seen carrying a black backpack			1
an @entity24 official earlier said that authorities believe the bombs were placed inside a black nylon backpack or bag			1
the source said that authorities had not yet identified the two men by name and that the photographs were not being released to the public for fear of impeding the investigation			1
earlier wednesday , two official sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man -- who also has n't been named -- as a possible suspect in the attack			1
seen on a video , this man wore a white baseball cap			1
one of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light - colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket			1
it was not immediately known if this man is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials			1
this movement in the investigation came two days after the horrific blast shook the city , during what is traditionally one of its biggest and most beloved events each year			1
by wednesday , authorities had made " significant progress " in the case but no arrests , a federal law enforcement source told @entity0 's @entity69			1
sources previously told @entity0 that a suspect was in custody , but both @entity74 police and the @entity24 denied that any arrests had been made			1
a @entity74 law enforcement source told @entity0 , " we got him , " but would n't clarify whether that meant a suspect has been identified or arrested			1
some federal sources said it was even too early to say investigators had identified the suspect , but several sources in @entity74 told @entity0 that they have a clear identification			1
speaking on @entity0 's @entity86 , @entity85 gov. @entity84 said investigators were closer to cracking the case " every hour			1
" but he urged patience with the probe			1
" what i would say and i would ask of everyone is we give law enforcement the space to do their work , " @entity84 said			1
" when they are ready with a complete picture , they will tell us what that picture is			1
" he added , " i wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe , but i understand from experience it 's going to take some time			2
" earlier wednesday , investigators revealed more details about the makeup of the bombs , which exploded 12 seconds apart			1
one had been housed in a pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack , the @entity24 said in a joint intelligence bulletin			1
the device also had fragments that may have included nails , bbs and ball bearings , the agency said			2
the lid of a pressure cooker thought to be used in the device was found on a rooftop at the scene , a federal law enforcement official with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told @entity0			1
the second bomb was also housed in a metal container , but it was not clear whether it too was in a pressure cooker , the @entity24 said			2
the @entity133 government has warned federal agencies in the past that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel and detonating them with blasting caps			1
the bombs photos obtained by @entity0 show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene , along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings			1
scraps of at least one pressure cooker , nails and nylon bags found at the scene were sent to the @entity24 's national laboratory in @entity159 , where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices , the agent leading the investigation said tuesday			2
the pieces suggest each of the devices was 6 liters ( about 1.6 gallons ) in volume , a @entity74 law enforcement source said			2
the recovered parts include part of a circuit board , which might have been used to detonate a device			2
a law enforcement official said monday 's bombs were probably detonated by timers			1
but the @entity24 said details of the detonating system were unknown			2
while the clues moved the investigation forward , they did not make it immediately apparent whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism			2
" if your experience and your expertise is @entity189 terrorism , it has the hallmarks of @entity191 or a @entity189 group , " former @entity24 assistant director @entity183 said			2
" if your experience is domestic groups and bombings that have occurred here , it has the hallmarks of a domestic terrorist like @entity200 in the 1996 @entity202 bombings			2
" things we know @entity183 said he has investigated both types of terrorism -- from @entity207 to the @entity133 -- and finds the @entity74 attack has elements of both			2
" it has the hallmarks of both domestic and international ( attacks ) , and you can see either side of that			2
" opinion : why is this so rare ? third victim identified @entity220 identified graduate student @entity221 as the third person who died in monday 's bombings			2
previously identified were @entity224 , 29 , of @entity225 , @entity85 , and @entity226 , 8 , of @entity227 , @entity85			2

" we were having a great day and waiting to see our friend cross the finish line , " he said , " and then all of the sudden it turned in a flash			1
" he told @entity0 he 's worried about the financial burdens his friends could face as a result of the explosion			0
one friend is a carpenter and " both his hands are incinerated			0
he ca n't go to work , and the bills keep coming in			0
" " it 's not just the hospitals			0
it 's everyday life that does n't stop			0
... we 're just hoping the mayor , the governor , president @entity371 do n't let us as citizens down			0
" beyond those seriously wounded , the incident affected thousands , including @entity378 , who was cheering on a friend when the festive atmosphere turned into a " terrifying hell			0
" she suffered minor injuries			0
" i personally will never participate in an event of this nature in a city in fear that something like this could happen again , " she said			0
" i keep replaying the moments of terror over and over in my head and am just still in utter shock			0
