two @entity2 fraternities that threatened they would not sign a new safety agreement with the school have now " reluctantly " signed under pressure , each organization said			1
signing the new agreement means they will abide by new rules the university instated following a tense discussion over sexual assault and binge drinking at fraternities , sparked by a now - discredited article in @entity18 magazine depicting a gang rape at one fraternity house			1
in the article , a then - first - year named @entity21 described a rape by seven members of @entity25 at @entity2 in september 2012			1
but @entity27 police have since said that there is no indication that @entity21 was raped at the fraternity house			0
two days after the article came out in november , but before it was widely criticized for factual errors , @entity2 suspended all fraternities and sororities , allowing them to reopen social activities in january only under the new terms			1
those new safety measures include having security at parties , sober brothers , keys to each room , monitors at the stairs and eliminating pre-mixed drinks			2
but @entity45 and @entity46 released statements on their national fraternity letterhead stating they would not sign the new agreement			1
late friday , up against the deadline , they relented			0
" it is extraordinarily disappointing to see a university of this caliber sacrifice the ideals of freedom of association and due process on the altar of public opinion , " the chapters said in a joint statement			0
" @entity2 has made it clear in writing today that our organizations will remain suspended if we do not sign the new @entity65 immediately and have rejected our requests for an extension to continue discussing our concerns			1
" all of the university 's 31 @entity70 organizations have now signed the agreement			0
@entity25 , the fraternity slammed in the article , was the first to sign , the university said			2
@entity45 and @entity46 said that they will keep fighting the new rules			2
" the fact that our chapters are signing the [ agreement ] does not alleviate the coercion , duress or other wrongdoing of the @entity2 through this entire process			1
given the @entity2 's poor handling of this matter , we are now exploring the right to pursue any legal remedies			2
" while police have seemingly cleared @entity25 , they have not ended their investigation			0
they have also not said if they believe @entity21 may have been raped elsewhere			0
@entity18 apologized for the inaccuracies in the article , which was written by freelance journalist @entity95 , and launched an investigation of its own			0
the magazine editor acknowledged that the writer did n't contact some of the witnesses , and none of the accused .			0

@entity45 and @entity46 had refused to sign @entity2 agreement
new rules for safety at social events arose from a now - discredited article *alleging* a 2012 rape on campus
the *holdout* fraternities say @entity2 pressured them into signing and " rejected our requests for an extension "
fraternities : signing " does not alleviate the coercion , duress or other wrongdoing of the @entity2 through this entire process "
