@entity0 , @entity1 -- each one bears his own scar			1
this close - knit band of paramedics and ambulance drivers risk their lives saving others on the front lines of @entity1 's wars			1
@entity12 has a shrapnel wound to the arm			1
but that 's not the one that cuts the deepest			1
when we find him , he 's washing the blood off a stretcher in his ambulance			1
that 's the blood of 24 - year - old @entity25 , who was reciting the @entity26 when a missile from an @entity29 drone struck him monday			1
@entity12 and his colleagues scraped together the unconscious and broken @entity25			1
he tells @entity2 how he and his colleagues struggled to plug the holes in the man 's body with gauze to stop him from bleeding to death -- all while the ambulance races toward @entity1 's main hospital , @entity39			1
it 's back at the ambulance depot that we catch up with @entity12 and more than a dozen of his colleagues			1
it 's here where the tragic cycle begins again			1
it all starts with a phone call -- the emergency number in @entity1 is one , zero , one			1
at the ambulance dispatch center located in @entity51 in @entity0 , workers from the @entity55 @entity54 monitor phones , maps and computers while they wait for the inevitable			1
a board illuminated with red numbers tallies 193 dead and 1,481 injured as of tuesday afternoon			1
a job that requires a lot of risk the head of emergency services in @entity1 , dr. @entity65 , directs the nearest ambulance to the latest @entity29 airstrike			1
the fight between the @entity29 military and @entity1 militants began over a week ago			1
it 's not the first time			1
@entity65 has a deep , personal understanding of the importance of a quick response			1
in the december 2008 to january 2009 war between @entity29 and @entity77 , a war that was code - named " @entity79 , " shrapnel injured @entity65 's then 10 - year - old son			1
" time is a matter of life or death , " says the doctor			2
but he 's also acutely aware that every dispatch puts his paramedics in harm 's way			2
in @entity79 , he says he had more than 30 paramedics killed and almost all of his ambulances destroyed			1
in 2012 's conflict , he says , one paramedic was killed and 7 were injured			1
this time around , he says , he 's been lucky : only 15 paramedics have been injured			2
back at the ambulance depot , exhausted shift manager @entity97 takes incoming calls			1
paramedics work 24 - hours on , 24 - hours off			2
it puts a strain on their nerves			2
" everything is bad in the war			2
we do not like war , " says @entity97			2
" we want this war to stop			2
" the phone rings once again , when suddenly the building shutters and windows rattle			2
a large bomb just exploded nearby			2
on the lookout for a second explosion a controlled panic grips the station as ambulance after ambulance races toward the rising plume of black smoke			1
they stop short of the crater			2
experience has taught them that there could be a second bomb			2
paramedics and firefighters wait in the periphery until they get the all clear			2
this time nobody was injured			2
they return to base , where @entity12 and other paramedics sit with a feast of rice , lamb , dates and juice			0
@entity139 is just beginning to fall and the ambulance men are getting ready to break their fast			1
this is the @entity144 holy month of @entity145 , during which the faithful abstain from eating or drinking between sunrise to sunset			0
they joke around about being tempted to break it too early ; something frowned upon			0
the levity is needed to dispel the day 's morbid encounters			0
@entity155 affects each man a different way			0
but they say it 's the emotional scars that are the hardest to bear			0
" the anger boils inside us as the pressure grows , knowing our actions are a matter of life or death			0
" says 39 - year - old @entity168 , the station chief of @entity170 ambulance station			1
" unfortunately , we carry those emotions home and fight with our families			0
" 39 - year - old @entity174 talks about how the 20 to 30 trips a day can be dangerous			0
he recalls once when he " had finished dropping off a victim and was driving past a police station while on our way back to our station			0
@entity180 started raining down on the police and the shock wave tossed our car like a toy			0
" another call haunts him , too			0
" we heard two kids selling ice cream were hit in @entity190 neighborhood , " he says			0
" the only thing we could do for them was to collect the pieces of their bodies			0
" false hope and a realization then there is 50 - year - old @entity199			0
there 's not much this paramedic of 17 years and father of two has n't seen			0
but even this stoic man has trouble talking about his worst encounter			0
he arrived on scene of a smoldering car hit by a bomb			0
" we saw kids meticulously collecting body parts and trying to aid the injured , " says @entity199			0
" they felt it was their duty to help			0
" but late monday it seemed like their nightmare was about to be over			0
the room erupts into cheering and song as the radio announces that the @entity221 government has proposed a cease - fire between @entity29 and @entity1 militants for the following day			1
relief spreads across their faces with knowledge that they may have survived another war			0
by the following day , they realized that would n't be the case			0
the militants rejected the cease - fire call by releasing a barrage of rockets			0
and @entity29 resumed airstrikes on this coastal strip			0
the fighting was about to get worse and the scars were about to cut a whole lot deeper			0
@entity12 got an update about his wounded patient 's condition -- the young man hit in a drone strike			1
he did n't make it			0
he died at the hospital			0
how did this happen ? @entity248 , @entity247 , @entity1 and @entity249 all in flames trapped in war : ' this is tyranny '			1
