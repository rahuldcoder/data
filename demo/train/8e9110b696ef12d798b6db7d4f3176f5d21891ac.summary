-- can a secular , @entity2 insider make a religious movie @entity4 can fully , warmly embrace and -- wait for it -- actually learn from ? we 'll find out for sure on march 28 when the movie " @entity8 " opens in theaters nationwide			1
but , at first glance the answer is -- no. @entity12 , eager to appeal to the religious crowd , arranged screenings of the movie before its release			2
officially , some competing versions of the film " tested poorly			0
" sounds to me like audiences hated most of what they saw , although it 's not clear exactly what version of the film they hated			2
critics " lucky " enough to see early versions of the movie were sworn to secrecy			0
but , we do know their reaction prompted @entity12 to not only recut the movie several times , but to take the extraordinary step of schmoozing the president of the @entity36 group by agreeing to issue this disclaimer : " the film is inspired by the story of @entity8			1
while artistic license has been taken , we believe that this film is true to the essence , values , and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide			1
the biblical story of @entity8 can be found in the book of @entity50			1
" even the actor who portrays @entity8 , @entity52 , tweeted : " @entity53 , sorry that i have caused havoc in your social media world			2
seriously though , # @entity8 the movie will fascinate you			2
" see , that 's the thing			0
the director , a self - described atheist , is @entity62 , who produced the movie " @entity64			0
" he is way more interested -- and i mean way , way more interested -- in making @entity8 " fascinating " than " true to the @entity67 , " telling the @entity68 , " ' @entity8 ' is the least biblical biblical film ever made			2
i do n't give a f --- about the test scores ( early negative audience reaction to " @entity8 " )			1
my films are outside the scores			0
" put that in your pipe and smoke it ! it 's not that religious audiences dislike artistic license , they just hate it when @entity2 exploits a sacred story to promote a secular agenda			1
@entity85 , blogger and author of the book " @entity88 , " sparked a firestorm when he reviewed an early script of " @entity8			2
" @entity85 's article was titled : " @entity62 's @entity8 : environmentalist @entity92			1
" it promptly went viral			0
he says @entity62 , at least early on , turned a @entity67 story into " environmental paganism			0
" " it 's not that ( @entity98 ) are intolerant , but look , you 're playing with their sacred story			1
" @entity85 says the story of @entity8 was not about " @entity103 destroying the @entity104 because man was destroying the @entity104 , " it was about @entity103 destroying the @entity104 because of " man 's sinfulness			1
" @entity108 , who produced the wildly successful " @entity109 , " agrees			0
" you know one thing is -- it 's not just any book , correct ? it 's a sacred text			1
it 's a sacred text that millions of people have willingly died for			1
it 's not anything to mess around with			0
you 've got to be faithful to a sacred text like this			1
" @entity2 has been making movies about the @entity67 since the silent era			1
" @entity125 " and " @entity126 " were huge hits			0
did they stick to the sacred script ? no. and , you guessed it , some biblical scholars were not pleased			2
" @entity2 has an agenda and that 's to sell films and make it exciting , not necessarily to convey historical accuracy nor to convey theological values , " says rabbi @entity133 , executive vice president for the @entity134			1
even @entity143 's popular " @entity142 , " which portrayed the @entity145 enslavement in @entity146 , " gave a skewed , simplistic and primitive notion of religion			0
it almost had no value , " @entity133 says			0
seriously ? no value ? with all due respect , rabbi well , if we 're in danger of becoming a nonreligious country -- according to @entity154 , just 58 % of millennials believe in @entity103 -- why not attract young people to a movie that , at least , entertains them with stories inspired by the @entity67 ? movies unlike the hit film " @entity109 , " which while successful , arguably did not attract the @entity163 crowd			1
@entity164 , a religious scholar who wrote the book - and - soon - to - be - movie , " @entity166 " says , " ' @entity109 ' is a movie made by @entity98 for @entity98			0
non-christians will not go see ' @entity109 ' -- because it 's a terrible movie			0
" @entity164 is eager to see " @entity8 , " and , no , it does n't bother him in the least if @entity62 takes liberties with his portrayal of @entity8			1
he says the story of @entity8 in the @entity67 is barely forty verses long			1
" if you wanted to make a biblically based @entity8 story it would be 10 minutes long			1
... if you 're going to approach this topic , you have no choice but to expand on it , to make things up , to create a narrative out of it			0
" the most interesting aspects of the @entity8 story , he says , come after the floodwaters recede			1
" @entity8 gets drunk and lies naked in front of his son			2
go and check it out			0
" i 'm pretty sure @entity62 wo n't include that scene in his movie , but what if he did ? dr. @entity195 , provost and biblical scholar at the @entity197 , says there is no harm in interpreting the @entity67 in a secular , @entity2 kind of way			1
" the whole point of interpretation , whether it 's in the form of a painting or a film , is to stimulate discussion of issues authors raise and do n't always resolve			2
that 's true throughout the @entity67			0
" @entity212 , the pastor of the @entity214 megachurch in @entity215 , is on board			0
" you know , to be honest with you , i think unfortunately , a lot of @entity98 are known for what they are against , not what they are for			0
and so i think i 'm going to go see the ' @entity8 ' movie			2
i 'm actually looking forward to it because at least it creates conversation			0
" @entity227 , pastor @entity212 , amen			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity231 : will @entity4 embrace @entity2 version of " @entity8 " story ? probably not
*detractors* say story should stick to sacred text . director says that 's not his goal
she says many religious movies take artistic license ; why is that so wrong ?
@entity231 : with belief in @entity103 declining , is n't it at least good to stoke conversation ?
