-- as former governors , we were honored to serve the people of our respective states			0
while we represent different political parties , we are united in our belief that government has stopped working for the @entity9 people -- and that real reform of the electoral process is needed to get it back on track			1
as we look at our politics today , we are deeply troubled by the corrosive role that special interest money has come to play in determining who runs for office and who wins , and its influence over what policy decisions that are made in the legislative process			2
policymakers in our nation 's capital seem incapable of addressing our most pressing challenges , and the hyper - partisanship of recent times is only made worse by the fact @entity30 is dependent on the funders , not the voters			2
indeed , surveys consistently indicate large majorities of @entity9 agree that wealthy special interests have too much sway over the political system			0
and if you look at where campaign contributions come from , they 're right			0
in the last national election cycle , less than 1 % of the population was responsible for providing the vast majority of campaign funds , with 0.1 % of citizens contributing $ 2,500 or more in the last election and accounting for fully 67 % of total itemized donations			0
opinion : why @entity49 is corrupt we know of only one way to fundamentally change our broken pay - to - play system : public funding of elections			1
the concept is straightforward - put ownership of our public elections in the hands of voters , not special - interest donors , and the politicians who are elected will be accountable to them			2
while the need for campaign reform on the national level may be painfully self - evident , there is little sign of attention or movement from either end of @entity70			2
there is a significant opportunity for success in @entity74 , however , as a many lawmakers and governor @entity76 support the enactment of a campaign finance reform package that includes a system of public funding of elections			1
legislation based on the very successful small donor matching fund system that has been in operation in @entity84 for 25 years has passed the @entity85 , and now it is up to the @entity87 to follow suit			1
the @entity84 system is voluntary , giving a candidate the option of opting in , and it enjoys strong public support , encouraging political competition while greatly increasing the participation of small donors and curtailing the influence of special interests in city government			1
in addition , three states offer candidates for public office to compete in this way -- @entity104 , @entity105 , and @entity106			0
qualified citizens from all walks of life are able to serve , and the relationship between money and politics is greatly reduced			0
in @entity115 , public funding of elections is available to candidates for @entity76 , allowing candidates who qualify with a greater ability to run for office and get their ideas before voters			1
as a result of federal court decisions that equate political expenditures with the exercise of the first amendment , participation in public funding of elections systems must be voluntary in order to meet constitutional muster			1
the current campaign finance system will not be wholly replaced , but public funding of elections allows candidates without access to large donors and special - interest backing to compete against those candidates who do , as the practical experience in @entity84 and the states that have full public funding of elections strongly demonstrate			1
@entity84 's campaign finance system is built for the big donor -- not the average voter			2
individuals can contribute up to $ 60,800 to a single candidate , more than 10 times the limit to presidential candidates			0
the end result is that the vast majority of citizens who ca n't afford to make big donations feel shut out and disconnected from those that represent them			0
in addition to small donor public financing , lowering contribution limits will enhance the participation of citizens in @entity84 's political system			1
the public supports this fundamental reform of our political system strongly , both nationally and in @entity74			2
a recent public opinion survey indicated that 80 % of independents , 75 % of @entity169 and 68 % of @entity170 support a small donor matching system of public funding of elections			1
voters need to hold their elected officials accountable , letting them know that supporting and participating in a reformed campaign finance system is a voting issue			0
campaign finance reform in @entity74 will not only improve how @entity178 works , it has national implications			0
@entity84 can lead the way , providing a beacon to the nation			0
a son of @entity84 , president @entity183 proposed a system of public funding of elections in 1905			1
this is in keeping with the grand tradition of innovation that @entity84 have led in the past , and enacting campaign finance reform with a small donor match as its centerpiece will continue that tradition			1
making our political system work for the @entity9 people is a cause that political leaders across the spectrum can and should get behind			0
we urge the @entity200 and @entity76 to work enact campaign finance reform now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 and @entity205 .			2

@entity204 , @entity205 : government has stopped working for the people
@entity204 , @entity205 : real reform of the electoral process is needed to get it back on track
