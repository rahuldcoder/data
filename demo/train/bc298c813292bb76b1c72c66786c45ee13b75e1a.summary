-- when i was 48 , i was working at @entity2 , at the pinnacle of my career and raising the family we had waited for so long to start			1
the last thing i was ready for was being told i had @entity8 's			1
there we were , being warned that our lives were changing forever			1
@entity11 , my wife , did n't blink an eye			1
when we spoke of the disease , we were always positive and stayed strong			1
in hindsight , i realize how scared both of us silently were			1
my daily activities did n't change			1
i worked , as all coaches do , extremely long days , but looming in the back of my mind was the disease and its progression			2
to thwart the development i was able to stay active , something i had always been ; however , i started to notice small changes , and the inability on some days to complete the simple tasks i had always done			2
that would come and go ; it was n't consistent			2
one day i was able to change a light bulb and the next time i would try , my hands would fail me			2
afraid to admit the decline was beginning , i never mentioned it to @entity11 , but i know she was watching , waiting to step in			2
@entity8 's did n't stop his space walk @entity11 started to notice my good days and bad days , and i would see her instinctively change our plans and schedule			1
she and the kids would jump in and help me the same way that my players had each others ' backs on the field			2
i fondly remember the loving moments of my two girls helping me button my shirt in the morning , though those moments were bittersweet			1
should n't i be helping them ? my newfound clumsiness was beginning to be the elephant in the room , and the locker room was where it decided to expose itself			1
we had just lost a well - fought game and had to catch the team plane			2
i had spent all of my energy on the field , and there was nothing left my body would give me			0
with my hands unable to steady themselves , i could n't button my shirt			1
a task so simple , mastered at age 5 , was now gone			0
my weaknesses were completely exposed , and there i was , unable to get dressed on my own			1
one of my college players , @entity74 ( now the @entity75 ' starting quarterback ) , noticed			0
he came over and helped me in silence , the way @entity11 or the girls would			0
i did n't really realize that my players had watched this painful process i was going through			0
players were always a part of our family , but here i realized that now i was a part of theirs			0
this moment was the turning point in my life and changed how i was going to address my condition			1
@entity92 driver races to stop diabetes my pride was out the window			0
i was hoping to make a difference in my players ' lives , and now they were watching this unfold			0
would they still respect me ? would i still have a job ? all those fears that i had pushed to the back came flooding to the surface			0
i was afraid to tell @entity11 , afraid that she would think less of me as her husband , less of me as a parent			0
instead , everyone dug in and helped secure my dignity in their own ways			0
all the years of preaching perseverance was paying off			0
my disease continues to progress despite the fight we rally			0
i can not count the things i 've lost			0
that list is extensive , but i prefer to take the lead from another coach , the legendary @entity119 -- " i 've learned that something constructive comes from every defeat " -- and now , i am blessed with the things that i have gained			1
my path may have changed course from where i started , but i am grateful that it has not hit a dead end .			0
