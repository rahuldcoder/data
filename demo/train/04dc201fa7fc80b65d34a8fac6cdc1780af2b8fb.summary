an environmental advocacy group backed by hedge fund tycoon @entity1 is set to unleash a seven - state , $ 100 million offensive against @entity5 " science deniers " this year , a no - holds - barred campaign - style push from the green billionaire that could help decide which party controls the @entity9 and key statehouses come november			1
the @entity1 - backed outside group , @entity11 , has billed itself as a progressive , pro-environment counterbalance to the wealthy oil and gas industry -- as well as the primary foil to the pro-business @entity16 brothers and their well - funded conservative donor network			1
the outfit , launched last year by the @entity20 billionaire , has already pledged to spend heavily this midterm year in @entity22 to assist the @entity24 @entity9 nominee @entity23 , and in @entity26 , where gov. @entity25 is facing a difficult re-election fight against @entity29 @entity28			1
@entity1 's 2014 map now includes @entity9 races in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 as well as governor 's races in @entity37 and @entity38 , home to two of the most endangered @entity5 governors in the country , @entity40 and @entity43			1
" this is the year , in our view , that we are able to demonstrate that you can use climate , you can do it well , you can do it in a smart way , to win political races , " said @entity44 , the longtime @entity24 consultant advising @entity1			1
@entity44 and @entity11 political strategist @entity52 revealed their 2014 strategy wednesday in a briefing with reporters in @entity57			0
' @entity58 ' vs. ' anti-science ' absent from their list of 2014 targets : must - win @entity9 races for @entity63 in conservative - leaning states such as @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
that 's because @entity63 on those ballots have expressed support for the @entity73 , the coal industry , offshore drilling or hydraulic fracturing -- all nonstarter issues for environmentalists			2
instead , @entity44 said the 501 ( c ) 4 group will play in races that feature a stark choice between " pro-climate action " candidates -- all @entity63 -- and " anti-science " @entity5 who have questioned the veracity of climate change or supported the interests of the oil and gas industry			1
@entity5 candidates in the @entity11 cross hairs -- @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity90 in @entity32 , @entity91 in @entity33 and @entity92 in @entity34 -- hew closely to the " @entity5 troglodyte brand , " @entity44 argued			2
" they are anti-immigrant , anti-women , anti-science , " he said			2
" it 's a tough brand to win elections around			2
" the group said that climate can be successfully used as a wedge issue -- @entity44 framed it as a moral clash between " right and wrong " -- to boost turnout among @entity24 voting groups that tend not to show up in midterm election years , specifically young voters , @entity106 and african - americans			2
as in the @entity113 governor 's race last year -- when @entity1 spent nearly $ 8 million on a campaign to disqualify @entity5 nominee @entity115 with a combination of tv , mail and field operations -- the efforts will extend beyond the tv airwaves and include what they call " nano - targeting " to tailor messaging to discrete voting groups			1
" we are not some super pac that 's going to come in , throw up some ads and leave , " @entity44 said			2
" you can come into these states and really run a total campaign			0
" focusing on hyper - local issues @entity44 said the effort , which is budgeted at around $ 100 million but could grow , will focus attention on hyper - local issues -- such as drought in @entity22 or flood insurance costs in @entity26 -- that could influence voter perceptions in key pockets of each state			2
pollution - related health concerns such as asthma and clean drinking water hit home for lower - income voters , he said			0
it was n't lost on reporters that the @entity11 map featured multiple states that figure prominently in presidential races -- @entity22 , @entity33 and @entity26 among them			2
@entity44 said that was by design			0
" almost all of these states align with being really important presidential states either in the primary process or the general election , " he said , promising that @entity1 will be active throughout the 2016 campaign			1
when the 2016 presidential primary campaigns lurch into overdrive next year , @entity11 will continue to call attention to turnout - driving local issues -- and on attacking @entity5 candidates			0
@entity1 has already funded an ad in @entity26 attacking sen. @entity161 , one of many possible @entity5 @entity163 aspirants , as a tool of oil lobbyists			1
" we look forward to a conversation with the @entity171 of the world , " @entity44 said of the group 's 2016 plans , without revealing specifics			1
the outside air cover should come as welcome news to @entity24 candidates in their target states who are drowning in a flood of tv ads from conservative groups such as the @entity16 - endorsed @entity181			0
but the campaign may put some @entity63 in a bind			0
in @entity34 , for instance , @entity44 said @entity11 will attack @entity92 by showcasing his support for hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , and the adverse health effects of natural gas extraction on suburban communities			0
but the strategy could force @entity24 sen. @entity191 to take a definitive stand on a divisive state issue that pits the business community against environmentalists , an important slice of the @entity24 base			0
meanwhile , the state 's @entity198 governor , @entity198 , has been cautiously supportive of the gas industry as a revenue and jobs creator			0
charges of hypocrisy as the founder of the hedge fund @entity205 , @entity1 made part of his fortune from investments in fossil fuels , including foreign coal investments , which has prompted charges of hypocrisy from the @entity16 - affiliated groups he 's fond of condemning			1
" @entity1 's investments at @entity205 have lined his pockets with millions of dollars from the foreign coal industry , " said @entity213 , a spokesman for @entity214 , the @entity16 - backed political network			1
" now he wants to burden the @entity220 people with new energy regulations to protect his current green energy investments			0
he 's already attempting to buy the votes of @entity63 on @entity73 , which will cost @entity220 thousands of good - paying jobs			0
surely the media will call him out on the hypocrisy of his claims			0
" @entity44 said @entity1 ordered his investments be diverted from coal and tar sands when he stepped down from @entity205 in 2012 but was not aware if he had investments in other energy sectors			1
but the primary difference between @entity1 and conservative mega-donors , @entity44 said , is that @entity1 is not personally profiting from his political efforts			1
" he is giving all the money away , " he said			0
" he does n't have stand to gain some economic benefit by spending money that translates into his own personal economics			0
" @entity44 added , " we are spending a drop in the big oil bucket as compared to the fossil fuel industry , especially the @entity16 brothers			0
all @entity1 is trying to do is try to balance and level the playing field			1
we are never going to have as much money as the other side			0

billionaire 's environmental group is targeting @entity9 , governors ' races
focus is on races with contrast between pro-environment vs. " anti-science " candidates
*critics* accuse @entity1 of hypocrisy , saying he made his money on fossil fuels
