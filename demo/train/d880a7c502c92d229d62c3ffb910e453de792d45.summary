an online threat made by one of the killers of @entity5 soldier @entity4 could have tipped off security agencies and perhaps prevented his murder , lawmakers said tuesday , but @entity5 authorities were never alerted to it			1
the brutal may 2013 assault , in which @entity11 and @entity12 hit soldier @entity4 with a car , then hacked him to death with a meat cleaver and knives , shocked the nation			1
the men , both @entity21 converts , were handed down lengthy prison sentences this year			0
a parliamentary committee investigating the killing concluded in its report that despite carrying out seven probes into the pair , the @entity5 security and intelligence agencies could not have stopped the attack based on what they knew			1
sir @entity33 , chairman of the @entity34 , said only one thing could have changed that : an online exchange that came to light after @entity4 's death			1
but , he said , it was " highly unlikely " that the agencies could have discovered it , and the company involved did not alert them to it			1
while there were errors and delays in the seven investigations into the two men , @entity33 said , none of them was significant enough to have made a difference to the outcome			0
prime minister @entity55 , addressing @entity54 on tuesday , said that he shared the committee 's concerns about terrorists ' use of the @entity60 and that the government was doing all it could to combat this			1
" we expect the @entity60 companies to do all they can , too , " he said			0
" their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem			0
it is their social responsibility to act on this			0
and we expect them to live up to it			0
" ' safe haven for terrorists ' in the december 2012 exchange , between @entity12 and an extremist overseas , @entity12 " expressed his intent to murder a soldier in the most graphic and emotive manner , " @entity33 said			0
" this was highly significant			0
had @entity83 had access to this exchange at the time , @entity12 would have become a top priority			0
there is then a significant possibility that @entity83 would have been able to prevent the attack			0
" but the only party that had access was the company hosting the exchange , he said , and it does not regard itself as under any obligation to ensure that it identifies such threats or reports them to authorities			2
" we find this unacceptable : however unintentionally , they are providing a safe haven for terrorists , " he said			0
@entity33 had stern words for online companies in relation to their cooperation with law enforcement agencies			2
" none of the major @entity110 companies we approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems , largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content , " he said			0
nor do they consider themselves obliged to comply with @entity5 warrants , he said -- meaning that even if @entity83 had sought information before the attack , the internet company might not have responded			1
" they appear to accept no responsibility for the services they provide , " he concluded			0
how @entity128 hate narrative inspired killers higher threat level the government has started to take action , through a law passed this year and the appointment of a special envoy on intelligence and data sharing , @entity33 said			0
" however , the problem is acute : until it is resolved the @entity5 public are exposed to a higher level of threat , " he said			2
however , @entity142 , brother of @entity11 , in a statement released by @entity144 , a @entity146 - led human rights advocacy group in @entity147 , accused the committee of trying to justify the expansion of the government 's spying powers			1
far from posting extremist material , his brother had almost no online presence at all , he said			2
" it seems opportunistic that such a report will allow the expansion of a policy that is proving unpopular in all spheres of @entity5 society , " @entity142 said			1
" it is sinister , to say the least , that emergency government policy will be drafted to allow the security services easier access to our social media and internet activities			2
" all this , he said , will only further alienate young @entity146 , make it harder to track " lone wolf " attackers as they abandon social media , and restrict people 's freedom of expression			0
@entity5 home secretary @entity177 said monday that a new counter-terrorism and security bill to be introduced in @entity54 on wednesday would include measures to help prevent radicalization , improve access to communications data and boost authorities ' ability to act against those who go abroad to fight with terror groups			1
intrusive techniques @entity33 said the report , following an 18 - month investigation , was the most detailed the nine - member , cross-party committee had ever published			2
the lawmakers inspected hundreds of highly classified documents and questioned ministers , the heads of the three agencies concerned and senior officers from the @entity199 , he said			0
of the two suspects , @entity11 -- the older of the two -- was a high priority for two operations by officers from @entity83 , the domestic @entity5 security and intelligence agency , but none of their efforts revealed any evidence of attack planning , @entity33 said			1
however , @entity12 was never more than a low - level subject of interest and the agencies had no intelligence to warrant more intrusive investigations			2
@entity33 defended the agencies ' actions , saying , " to put these investigations into perspective , it should be borne in mind that at any one time @entity83 is investigating several thousand individuals who are linked to @entity21 extremist activities in the @entity5			1
" but the @entity5 security and intelligence agencies also have lessons to learn , he said			1
urgent steps are needed to ensure that anti-radicalization programs work better , particularly given the number of young @entity5 men and women who have traveled to @entity231 and @entity232 in recent months to join extremist groups			2
also , he said , the response by @entity5 's overseas intelligence agency when @entity11 was arrested in @entity236 for suspicion of trying to join a terrorist organization was " inadequate			1
" ' @entity238 ' @entity11 and @entity12 , both in their 20s , were convicted of murder in december of last year			2
cell phone footage replayed at the trial showed @entity11 , still clutching a cleaver in his bloody hands , ranting that the killing was " @entity238 , a tooth for a tooth " for @entity5 soldiers killing @entity146 overseas			1
@entity11 will spend life in prison , while @entity12 received a sentence of at least 45 years			0
@entity4 , who had served in @entity253 and was off duty when he was killed at the age of 25 , left behind a wife and a young son .			1
