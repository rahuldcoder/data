-- @entity1 is a sport where fine margins separate success and failure , with teams going to extreme lengths to squeeze fractions of a second out of their precision - engineered racing machines			0
as a result , constructors jealously guard the secrets behind the design of their car			0
if those details were to fall into the hands of a rival team , it could dent a potential world championship charge			0
with that in mind , the @entity24 team pursued @entity29 wind tunnel manufacturer @entity27 for £ 15 million ( $ 23.6 million ) , eventually reduced to £ 13 million ( $ 20 million ) , after claiming aspects of their 2009 car design had been replicated by a rival team			1
what followed was a @entity37 @entity36 case involving @entity24 , @entity27 , and @entity1 marque @entity38 -- now known as @entity39			1
2012 @entity1 teams and drivers @entity27 initially launched a claim against @entity24 , run by team principal @entity43 , for unpaid funds			2
the case was complicated when , shortly after their split from @entity24 , @entity27 signed a contract to work on @entity38 ' 2010 car			2
a statement issued by @entity27 's legal representatives on wednesday said the company had been ordered to pay € 25,000 ( $ 39,500 ) in damages after work conducted during their contract with @entity24 had been used on @entity38 ' 2010 car			1
the statement read : " the @entity57 mr justice @entity56 held that @entity27 's @entity59 designers had misused certain of @entity24 's confidential information as a means of taking a ' short cut ' to produce a wind tunnel model which could begin to be used for testing as soon as possible			1
" he further held that a small number of the relevant wind tunnel model components had found their way as full size components into the car which @entity70 ( then racing under the name of @entity38 ) had raced at the beginning of the 2010 season			2
" it was a victory for @entity24 , but an expensive one			0
despite ruling @entity27 had incorrectly used intellectual property , the judge also said @entity24 must pay € 846,230 ( $ 1.3 million ) in unpaid fees			1
it was also decreed that @entity24 's claim of " systematic copying " by @entity38 , in particular chief technical officer @entity80 , was unfounded			0
@entity24 were unavailable for comment but a statement was issued on their official website			0
it said @entity24 will report the case to @entity1 's global governing body , the @entity86 , while continuing a criminal case against @entity39 team principal @entity88 , @entity80 and @entity27 owner @entity89			1
" the @entity37 @entity36 judgment , in respect of the illegal copying , will now be referred for the consideration of @entity1 's governing body , " read the statement			2
" the @entity29 criminal case against @entity80 , @entity88 and @entity96 remains ongoing			0

an @entity29 design company has been ordered by a @entity37 court to pay @entity24 $ 39,500
@entity27 used the team 's intellectual property while designing the @entity103 , now @entity39
@entity24 told to pay $ 1.3 million in unpaid fees to wind tunnel manufacturer @entity27
the marque intend to refer the *incident* to *motorsport* 's global governing body
