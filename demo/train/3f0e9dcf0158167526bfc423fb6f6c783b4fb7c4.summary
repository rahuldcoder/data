@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 district court judge declined friday to release the findings from authorities ' search of accused gunman @entity8 's family home because a federal investigation is still ongoing and a grand jury is preparing an indictment			1
@entity8 , 22 , is accused of shooting @entity4 rep. @entity13 , @entity14 , and 18 other people on january 8 , six of them fatally			1
an indictment could be ready by march 9 , when two @entity14 media outlets seeking the results of search warrants could renew their request , judge @entity17 said			2
in another matter relating to @entity8 , @entity17 said he would not make a ruling on a defense request to withhold two new mug shots of @entity8 taken by the @entity27 after his arrest in the mass shootings in @entity30 , @entity14			1
@entity8 , who is being held by authorities in @entity14 , did not appear in court friday			2
the marshals service attempt to release the two mug shots was based on a 6th @entity36 ruling , and the judge said he would let media outlets in the 6th @entity36 region -- @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 -- seek the release of the two mug shots			1
@entity17 was assigned to the @entity8 case by the 9th @entity36 , where he 's based , after @entity14 federal judges recused themselves from the case because their state 's chief federal judge was allegedly killed by @entity8			1
the 9th @entity36 region includes @entity1 and @entity14			0
@entity8 's public defenders sought to bar the release of the mug shots after the @entity27 planned to release them on february 7 under @entity54 requests made by 15 individuals , four of them within the @entity56 , according to court records and the judge			1
but the judge commented that the mug shots of @entity8 do n't appear to jeopardize his right to a fair trial			1
" i do not see a serious threat to his ability to get a fair trial if the two mug shots are released , " @entity17 said			2
federal prosecutors and @entity8 's public defender have opposed requests to make public the photos , asserting @entity8 's privacy rights and his 6th amendment guarantee for a fair trial			1
the mug shot of a smirking @entity8 that has widely appeared in the media was one taken by @entity76 , @entity14 , authorities after the shootings			1
federal prosecutors also opposed publicly disclosing the inventory of their search of @entity8 's house after the shooting , arguing in court papers that the media does n't have a right to search warrant materials until a formal indictment against @entity8 is made			1
but @entity88 , an attorney for two @entity14 media outlets seeking the search warrant results , said federal officials have already released selective details of the search and added that the @entity94 and federal law provide " a strong presumptive right of public access " to the records			2
but @entity88 's arguments failed to convince the judge			0
" i think his rulings were very understandable based on the information we heard for the first time ... namely there is still an investigation , " @entity88 said after friday 's hearing			0
the publishing company for the @entity111 newspaper and the @entity113 television station @entity112 were seeking to make public the results -- or returns -- of at least two search warrants executed in the @entity8 case , one issued by a @entity76 judge on the day of the shootings and another issued january 12			1
@entity8 is accused of shooting @entity13 in the head at a " @entity121 on your corner " event on january 8 at a @entity30 grocery store and then shooting 18 other people , six of them fatally			1
the dead included @entity13 staffer @entity128 and @entity4 district judge @entity130			0
@entity13 is recovering in a @entity132 rehabilitation hospital			0
@entity8 is charged with one count of attempting to assassinate @entity13 and two counts of attempted murder in the shootings of @entity13 staffers @entity137 and @entity139			2
@entity8 had also faced two murder charges in the deaths of @entity130 and @entity142 , but in a procedural maneuver last week , prosecutors temporarily dropped those two charges and plan to bring them back under a superseding indictment that is expected to include other charges as well			0
prosecutors intend to present a superseding indictment containing the murder charges at the next status hearing in the case on march 9 , said @entity153 , a spokesman for the @entity4 attorney 's office in @entity113			0
the federal government will prosecute @entity8 before state prosecutors pursue a criminal case against him , federal and state prosecutors said this month			0
friday 's hearing was held in @entity0 because presiding judge @entity17 and @entity8 's federal public defender , @entity161 , are based in the city			1
@entity17 is a 2003 @entity164 appointee serving in the @entity165 for @entity1 in @entity0			0
last month , @entity17 entered not guilty pleas on behalf of @entity8 , who declined to tell the court his plea during an arraignment			0
at that hearing , prosecutors said they had turned over hours of videos taken off @entity8 's home computer to the defense			2
two federal judicial sources told @entity2 last month they expect @entity8 's attorneys to ask that any trial be moved out of @entity14 , possibly to @entity0 , but the @entity179 indicated it would oppose a move			1
the sources said they expect the defense to make a formal motion in coming weeks to move court proceedings to a neighboring jurisdiction because of pretrial publicity			0
earlier last month , federal sources said that whether to support an out - of - state change of venue , a move that has happened rarely in recent years , appeared to be an ongoing point of disagreement within the @entity179			0
a trial also could be held in @entity14 outside @entity30 , those sources said			2
there are federal courthouses in @entity113 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
a final decision will be made by @entity199 , the new chief judge of the federal courts in @entity14			2
the 1994 @entity202 appointee to the federal bench has taken over for @entity130			0
federal sources said @entity199 -- if asked to move the trial -- would consult with officials of the @entity207 , the federal judicial region that comprises nine western states .			0
