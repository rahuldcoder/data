-- @entity2 immigration to the @entity3 has dropped sharply since 2005 , but the flow of migrants returning to @entity2 remains steady , according to a study released wednesday by the @entity7			1
plaques mark the @entity3 - @entity2 border near @entity10 , @entity11			1
immigration from @entity2 to the @entity3 slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008 , according to the analysis , based on national population surveys in the @entity3 and @entity2 , as well as @entity17 apprehension figures			1
the @entity2 survey estimated that 1 million @entity2 left for the @entity3 in a 12 - month period beginning in 2006			1
three years later , that number decreased to 636,000			0
" the size of the drop has been quite remarkable in such a small span of time , " @entity20 , senior demographer at the @entity7 and author of the study , told @entity0			2
the recession and enhanced border enforcement are factors that may explain the decrease in apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants in the @entity3 , according a @entity34 bulletin released last month			1
but if diminished job prospects in the @entity3 have kept would - be immigrants in @entity2 , employment worries have n't increased the number of @entity2 migrants leaving the @entity3 , the study found			1
an estimated 433,000 @entity2 migrants returned home between 2008 and 2009 , a number not significantly different than the 479,000 who returned three years earlier , @entity20 said			0
while the number of @entity2 migrants entering the @entity3 remains greater than the number returning , the study shows that the gap is closing to the point of nearing a balance between migrant inflows and outflows			1
" my guess is you have to go back at least 40 years or 50 years to see that , " @entity20 said			0
it is too early to tell , however , if either trend " points to a fundamental change in @entity3 - @entity2 immigration patterns or is a short - term response to heightened border enforcement , the weakened @entity3 economy or other forces , " the study states			1
the economic downturn has certainly affected work opportunities for immigrants in the @entity3 , said @entity69 , a day laborer who does construction and yard work in @entity73 area			1
" there are weeks where i have three days of work and the other four without work , " the @entity75 , @entity2 , native told @entity0			0
despite the reduced availability for work , @entity69 plans on staying put because the economic downturn is global			0
" i think things are more difficult there ( in @entity2 ) , " he said			0
the two trends found in the @entity7 study should not be surprising , @entity84 , a professor at @entity85 and an expert on immigration , told @entity0			1
for those in @entity2 , it remains expensive and risky to be smuggled into the @entity3 , especially in a weak economy , he said			2
" things are worse in @entity2 than they are here , " @entity84 said			2
" the job you have here is better than what you have there			0
if you go back , what do you go back to ? " another reason that @entity2 living in the @entity3 might stay is that they feel at home , he said			2
despite the stereotype of the @entity3 as an anti-immigrant destination , " at local levels , there is very little harassment , " @entity84 said			0
" by and large , people are accepting of immigrants			0
" another day laborer in @entity113 , who declined to give his name , said that the current economic crunch left him without the resources to return to his native @entity117 , @entity2 , even if he wanted			2
but even during these tough times , he is content			0
" it 's simple , we like living here in the @entity3 , " he said .			0
