-- the @entity1 , one of the world 's rarest species of freshwater dolphins , have been found in surprisingly large numbers deep in the waterlogged jungles of @entity8			1
the @entity1 is considered to be one of the world 's rarest species of freshwater dolphin			1
conservationists thought the @entity1 had dwindled in number to just a few hundred , but they have now counted almost 6,000 of them in the @entity17 mangrove forests and the adjacent waters of the @entity19			1
the forests of the @entity17 -- @entity21 for " beautiful forest " -- lie at the delta of the @entity24 and two other rivers on the @entity19			0
until now , little mammal research had taken place in the area			0
" every time we had done a study to look into the population ( elsewhere ) , they came out critically endangered , " said @entity29 of the @entity31 - based @entity30 , who led the study			0
" it was a very pleasant surprise and a shock to find that @entity8 supports such a large number ( of dolphins )			1
" the discovery is noteworthy because scientists do not know how many @entity1 dolphins remain			2
the next step , they say , is to ensure the mammal 's survival			2
one rare dolphin species -- the @entity50 , or baiji -- is extinct			1
another , the @entity52 , is critically endangered			0
some of the threats affecting the @entity1 are man - made			0
the construction of dams has reduced the flow of fresh water in many parts of @entity8			1
and the population is dwindling because the dolphins sometimes get caught in fishermen 's nets			1
the dolphin , which has a large , rounded head , can grow up to 8 feet in length and is related to the orca , or killer whale			0
it is found in large rivers , estuaries and freshwater lagoons in south and southeast @entity73			1
in @entity75 , the dolphins help herd schools of fish toward fishermen 's boats and nets			2
in @entity8 , fishermen hold them in high regard , @entity29 said			2
" there is no market for dolphin products , " he said			0
" in a country like @entity8 , with protein deficiency and where food is scarce , there is a real cultural prohibition against harming them			2
it gives us hope because it means fishermen are very receptive to working with us			0
" the results of the study were shared wednesday at a conference for marine mammal protected areas in @entity102 , and published in the winter issue of the @entity104			0
conservationists are now working with the @entity8 government to establish a protected area for the dolphins			1
" there are so many bad news ( stories ) coming out of the conservation community that this is a real sort of positive story , " @entity29 said .			0
