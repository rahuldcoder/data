the logistics of putting @entity2 on trial are as staggering as the carnage he allegedly committed in a crowded movie theater in @entity7 , @entity8 , in july 2012 when 12 people were killed and 58 others injured in gunfire			1
consider this : some 9,000 potential jurors are being summoned , and the jury selection that began tuesday could last until may or june when the trial would finally start			1
judge @entity16 told the first pool of potential jurors tuesday that if chosen for the jury , they can not read , watch or hear anything about the case			1
" this will require great effort on your part , " the judge said three times			1
also in the courtroom was @entity2 , whose face remained expressionless			2
he faced forward toward the judge 's bench the entire time without looking around or at the potential jurors in the room			1
@entity2 , who colored his hair red and told police he was " @entity38 " upon arrest after the mass killing , is now a different picture			2
in court tuesday , he had a clean haircut , trimmed beard , eyeglasses , gray sport coat , tan slacks and blue - and - white - striped dress shirt			1
here are five questions and answers about the approaching trial : how big and long will the trial be ? in all , @entity53 residents stand a 1 - in - 50 chance of receiving a summons , court spokesman @entity51 said			1
the enormous pool of potential jurors , designed to ensure a fair trial for @entity2 , is being called one of the largest in @entity61 history , legal analysts say			1
" i 've never heard of that many people , " @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity62 said			2
" it just shows how these high - profile cases impose such tremendous costs on the community			1
" @entity69 law professor @entity68 said those who support the death penalty are also more hostile to the insanity defense			0
" the public overestimates the frequency and success of the insanity plea , and misunderstands the consequences			0
so this hostility toward the defendant 's insanity plea will be a major challenge during voir dire , " which is the questioning of potential jurors , @entity78 said			1
@entity2 , a one - time neuroscience doctoral student , faces 166 counts , including murder and attempted murder charges			1
now 27 , he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity			0
if convicted of the most serious charges , he could face a death sentence			0
the trial could last four months			0
if there 's a conviction , the death penalty phase could last an additional month			1
in sum , court proceedings could last until november -- near @entity97 , according to @entity51			0
what is the impact of such a potential pool ? the court is casting such a wide net for jurors that it has unwittingly summoned 12 potential witnesses in the case			1
even one employee in the prosecutor 's office received a summons			1
judge @entity16 has already excused those individuals from the jury summonses			1
with the removal of 12 possible witnesses from the jury pool , the number of potential witnesses receiving a summons could now be as high as 43 , though prosecutors acknowledged in court papers " that it is likely two individuals could have the same names and not be the same person as the endorsed prosecution witnesses in this case			1
" the judge said " the court appreciates this information " but added that prosecutors should file another notice if such a conflict arises during jury selection			1
the potential conflicts do n't end there			2
additionally , four potential jurors are related to the prosecutor 's staff : two husbands , a father and an uncle			1
another potential juror is a best friend of a prosecution staff member			1
a wife and a former colleague of prosecution witnesses are also potential jurors , prosecutors say			1
. but the judge declined immediately to excuse those seven potential jurors			1
" because neither party asks the court to take any action with respect to these individuals , the court refrains from doing so at this time , " the judge said			2
what do the victims ' families say about all this ? district attorney @entity164 spoke with relatives of 60 victims who died or were injured			2
after consulting the families , he announced the prosecution will seek the death penalty for @entity2			0
" in this case , for @entity2 , justice is death , " @entity164 said in court			0
prosecutors have charged in court that @entity2 " intended to kill them all , " referring to patrons in the crowded movie theater watching the midnight release of the @entity181 film " @entity182			0
" @entity2 was heavily armed and " dressed head - to - toe in protective gear , " authorities said			2
he wore black contact lenses to conceal his eyes			0
his @entity188 jammed during the massacre , and police arrested him in the parking lot			0
meanwhile , @entity195 and @entity196 , parents of son @entity193 who was among those killed , continue a campaign exhorting news outlets to focus on victims and not even mention suspects ' names in mass shootings			0
@entity203 died while protecting his girlfriend from bullets			0
their plea to media is now called the # @entity211 : " stop rewarding mass murderers with the media attention they crave , " their @entity207 page says			0
what does @entity2 ' family say ? @entity217 and @entity2 have n't given any interviews about their son , but in december , they issued a public letter stating that " we have spent every moment for more than two years thinking about " the victims and their families			0
before the mass killing , their son " never harmed anyone and he had no criminal history , " the parents said			0
" we have read postings on the internet that have likened him to a monster			0
he is not a monster			0
he is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness , " they wrote			0
the parents want life imprisonment without parole for their son in exchange for a guilty plea , but the prosecutor has rejected such an offer from @entity2 ' attorneys			2
@entity2 ' family decried the need for a trial , saying it would cause additional trauma and " force everyone to relive those horrible moments in time			0
" " we believe that the death penalty is morally wrong , especially when the condemned is mentally ill , " the parents said			0
" the focus should be on the injured and their healing , " they added , referring to the theater victims			0
read the statement ( @entity257 ) what happened to the movie theater ? @entity7 's @entity261 cinema complex reopened in january 2013			2
elected officials and community members joined victims and their relatives at a remembrance ceremony timed with the theater 's reopening , which featured a screening of " @entity270			1
" but relatives of nine people killed in the gunfire criticized the remembrance ceremony as a publicity stunt by @entity275 , which runs the cinema			2
those families called the event " disgusting " and " wholly offensive to the memory of our loved ones			0
" but @entity281 , @entity275 's chief executive officer , which is facing lawsuits from several victims ' families and survivors , noted how " recovery is an ongoing process			2
" @entity0 's @entity288 contributed from @entity289 .			2

" this will require great effort on your part , " judge tells potential jurors of work ahead
there 's a 1 - in - 50 chance of receiving a jury summons in @entity53 , @entity8
jury summonses unwittingly sent to potential witnesses , relatives of prosecutor 's staff
