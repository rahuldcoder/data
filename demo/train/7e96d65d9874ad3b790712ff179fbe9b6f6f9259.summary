@entity0 , @entity1 -- you think it 's wild being a fan when a basketball - obsessed state encounters the biggest rivalry meeting in its history ? try being a politician			1
hours after the @entity13 punched its ticket to a @entity16 meeting against the @entity17 , @entity1 governor @entity12 's office was asked for a reaction			1
that was on sunday night , but it took until monday morning before it came			2
let 's just say the game plan from the @entity25 governor was conservative : " the best thing about this game is that a team from @entity1 will play for the national title			1
" ( @entity30 plays @entity31 in the other semifinal ) imagine the high - fives among the staff for walking that non-committal tightrope			0
others in the state have been less cautious			0
in a state defined by its basketball loyalties perhaps even more strongly than its political allegiances , the jump circle and political circle sometimes merge			0
@entity43 and @entity44 are @entity1 @entity25 who sit on the same side of the aisle in @entity48 , but will be on decidedly different sides of this rivalry			0
" the teams are both so good , i 'm sure that whoever prevails , it will be the experience of the teams ' seasoned upperclassmen that leads the way , " said @entity43 , whose district includes @entity0			0
@entity59 has only one seasoned upperclassman who plays regularly			1
@entity44 , whose district includes @entity61 , issued his own subtle jab , saying , " i think it 's great that everyone in @entity1 can be a part of the @entity67 ' journey to another championship			1
that 's not exactly a part that @entity0 fans will relish playing			1
when it comes to basketball , @entity59 is both a red ( @entity0 ) and a blue ( @entity1 ) state			1
the state 's most iconic architectural features , the @entity78 at @entity79 , home of the @entity80 illustrate the split			1
one is lit red , the other blue , for the entire week			0
@entity83 on @entity1 - @entity0 the latest poll conducted by the @entity85 found that about 65 percent of the state 's largest city identified themselves as @entity0 fans			1
out in the state , that number was 91 percent who backed @entity59 hoops			1
but wherever they are this week , there is conflict			0
on tuesday , in a dialysis clinic in @entity98 , @entity1 , police were called when two patients got into a fistfight over the game			1
@entity102 , 69 , was actually hooked up to a machine when he heard @entity104 , 72 and a @entity0 fan , " start to run his mouth , " @entity102 said			1
@entity104 said he was talking to another fan when @entity102 , " told me to shut up and gave me the finger			1
" so , dialysis machine or no dialysis machine , @entity104 went over and hit @entity102 -- and this longtime rivalry added another chapter to its lore			0
the rivalry , of course , has roots that run much deeper than sports			0
@entity0 , the state 's largest city , has always had a contentious relationship with the rural rest of the state			2
and basketball has played a major role in the identity of this state , has always been a point of pride for a population often on the lower rungs of the economic ladder			0
for much of their basketball histories , the teams did not play			0
legendary @entity59 coach @entity135 did n't believe in playing the smaller state schools			1
an example of @entity135 's influence : he once raised his hands in practice and said , " lord , please send me a man who is worth a damn ! " at that moment , then - governor ( and once commissioner of baseball ) @entity145 entered the gym			2
when @entity44 laughed , @entity135 told him he did n't care if he was the governor , if he could n't be quiet , he 'd have to leave			0
the @entity13 called the shots , and these teams did not play for 24 years until the @entity149 threw them together in a 1983 regional game dubbed " @entity151 , " by fans in the state			1
before that , all @entity154 could do was argue over which team was better			0
someone manufactured a board game with dice and player cards that could be used to simulate a contest			2
but resentment seemed to fester			0
in a vintage 1983 video before the @entity149 , @entity59 coach @entity163 tried to end an on - camera interview when he was asked about why the @entity67 would n't play the @entity166			1
@entity0 's @entity167 , young and confident , took great pleasure in baiting @entity1 and its fans			2
once @entity0 won that contest , the teams agreed to a yearly series , even as the state legislature was moving to force them to play			0
but none of the subsequent meetings has had as much at stake as saturday 's game -- a trip to the national championship			1
@entity180 : inside the @entity16 the rivalry between the coaches -- @entity183 at @entity0 and @entity184 at @entity1 -- only intensifies matters			0
@entity183 coached @entity59 to a national championship in 1996 and his name hangs in the rafters at @entity1 's @entity189 , while @entity184 is seeking his first national title			1
the two men have been polite this week			0
it 's unlikely their state will follow suit			2
it 's hard to describe to those outside the state how this rivalry is woven into its very fabric			2
a handful of weddings have been rescheduled			0
people wear @entity203 or @entity205 t - shirts under their clothes to church			0
businesses will close early on saturday			2
one local high school @entity209 had to reschedule its ceremonies because inductees were going to miss it to watch the game			2
early in the week , on @entity217 , a man claiming to be a @entity59 fan offered his wife in exchange for a @entity16 ticket			1
it might 've been a joke			0
it 's testament to the particular brand of @entity149 in this state that no one is really sure			2
from the statehouses to the coffee houses , time is going to stop on saturday night , and one fan base is going to dread going back to work on monday morning .			1

saturday 's game pits the @entity17 against the @entity13
@entity13 is the top seed in the *tournament*
one @entity59 fan *reportedly* offered his wife in exchange for a ticket
