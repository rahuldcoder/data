@entity0 , @entity1 -- hundreds of men and boys kneeled on the floor of a packed mosque for friday prayers , but the solemn religious rite quickly turned into a furious rain - soaked rally denouncing @entity1 's president , @entity11			1
before completing their prayers , the congregation murmured words of condolences for a resident of this small opposition - held village , @entity19			1
activists say @entity19 was killed friday morning by a sniper in the nearby city of @entity23 , an account @entity2 could not independently confirm			1
the remembrance of their neighbor caused the faithful to jump to their feet and erupt with the chant " @entity29 , " which means @entity30 is great			0
they repeated their full - throated chants as they marched from the mosque to the village square in a pounding , freezing rainstorm			1
they unfurled banners , waved the opposition green , black and white flag , and conducted a ritual of defiance that has been repeated weekly in this opposition enclave for months			1
" our first demonstration was on april 1st , " @entity44 told @entity2			0
" i have never missed a single demonstration since			0
" the 19 - year - old @entity44 led the latest demonstration in @entity0 , which has been experimenting with self - rule			1
he stood on a rooftop with a microphone , dressed in a scarf and fingerless gloves knit with the colors of the opposition flag , and sang verses insulting the @entity1 president			2
" this is a tool for us to show the world that we need support , " he said			0
" during the week when i 'm talking to the guys ( opposition activists ) over the internet , i think about what to chant on friday			1
" this week , @entity44 introduced new lyrics to protest songs			0
he replaced the word " hurriye , " which means freedom , which made up the chorus of a popular @entity1 protest song , with the word " harbiye , " which means ' war			0
' " we were peaceful for ten months but now there is no other solution			2
we will fight , even with knives , " said 21 - year - old university student who only wanted his first name @entity78 published , for security reasons			1
wearing an opposition scarf around his forehead , @entity78 had little positive to say about the @entity84 's non-binding resolution endorsing an @entity86 plan for @entity11 to step down			2
" we did n't watch real action from the @entity88 and all the world actually			0
they are just speeches , they do not help us , " he said			0
one of the protest organizers had kinder words for the @entity88 resolution			0
" it sends a strong message to @entity100 and to @entity101 and @entity102 that the world is against the @entity11 regime , " said @entity95 , who leads the local opposition council 's public relations committee			2
@entity95 said he was well aware that the latest diplomatic broadside against @entity100 would do little protect this small , defiant community should the @entity1 military mount an all - out assault			2
just a few kilometers away , within sight of @entity0 , the @entity1 government flag flies in the heart of the city of @entity23 , the capital of @entity23 province			1
opposition fighters have raised the rebel flag just a few hundred yards from the government banner , which is also visible in the city center			0
heavy machine gun fire from @entity23 periodically echoes across the countryside , and tracer bullets can be seen arcing out of the city at night			0
@entity0 residents say the @entity1 army maintains a base about five minutes away from their village 's central square			1
leaders of the rebellion in @entity0 say the army doubled the number of tanks at that base over the last 24 hours			1
that deployment raised fears of a possible imminent attack on this opposition enclave .			0

@entity0 is an opposition - held village
friday demonstrations have *unfolded* for months
one man says , ' we will fight , even with knives '
