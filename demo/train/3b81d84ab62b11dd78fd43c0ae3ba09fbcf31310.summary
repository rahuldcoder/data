@entity16 , of @entity17 's in @entity4 where the piece will go under the hammer on may 2 , said " @entity5 " was " the second most famous work of art in the world , after the ' @entity23			1
' " copies of the painting have appeared on everything from postcards and umbrellas to mousemats			0
the image inspired @entity32 's " @entity5 " film franchise , and was referenced in posters for the " @entity35 " movies , starring @entity36			1
" it has a double life , " @entity16 told @entity1			0
" it is a key image in the history of modern art , but on the other hand , it has also become a cornerstone of popular culture : we all know it from the films and the cartoons , the parodies , the pastiches and the toys			0
" what is fascinating for me is that while everybody knows ' @entity5 ' -- it is one of the most recognizable paintings anywhere -- relatively few people have actually seen the original			1
what we know are the cartoons and the parodies			0
" @entity16 , head of @entity62 and @entity63 at the auction house , said the picture 's status as a high - profile target for thieves had only boosted its popularity			0
" of the four versions , three are in public collections in @entity72 , and of those , two have been stolen in the past 20 years , " he said			2
" happily in each case the work was recovered , but that status as ' the world 's most stolen work of art ' has only added to its celebrity			2
" the thefts got ' @entity5 ' onto the cover of newspapers and on television around the world , so it became more and more famous			1
" when the @entity86 of @entity13 had its version stolen in 1994 , visitor numbers actually went up -- people came from around the world to look at the nail and the empty piece of wall where ' @entity5 ' was supposed to hang			1
" the picture -- a vivid pastel , produced in 1895 -- is owned by @entity95 , a member of the @entity97 shipping dynasty			1
his father @entity98 was a friend and neighbor of @entity6 , and amassed a large collection of the artist 's work			2
@entity97 is selling " @entity5 " to fund the construction of a museum and arts center , @entity106 , at @entity107 , @entity13 , in which he plans to display the rest of his paintings			1
the new venue is set to open next year , the 150th anniversary of @entity6 's birth			0
" i have lived with this work all my life , and its power and energy have only increased with time , " said @entity97			2

" @entity17 's says it expects huge interest in the piece , which it says has the potential to draw visitors from around the world to any collection which stumps up the cash to buy it			2
" the opportunity for a museum or a private collector to buy one of the great icons of art history is unlikely to be repeated any time soon , " said @entity16			0
" we know there is a lot of demand , and very little supply			0
it has truly global appeal , and could go anywhere			0
