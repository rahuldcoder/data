@entity0 -- when @entity3 emerged from his @entity0 home after @entity5 churned through the city in august , he could n't believe what he saw			1
nearly all of his neighbors had poured out into the streets to help each other clean up			0
it was a completely different environment than the one he 'd seen seven years ago , after @entity14 struck			1
" people started cleaning up their yards and helping neighbors that had gone away , " @entity3 said			0
" it was this silent but perfectly coordinated and synchronized effort			0
" this is what made him and his wife , who was expecting their second child , to cancel a trip they booked to @entity28 in order to escape the stress of the @entity5 aftermath			0
@entity3 says it 's the same sentiment that has brought people from all over the county to @entity0 in the years following @entity14 and has helped spur the city 's entrepreneurial movement			1
he moved his company , @entity37 , a travel - and - entertainment booking engine , back to @entity0 in january 2008 after relocating to @entity39			2
the move back to @entity0 caused him to lose almost all of his employees in @entity39 and forced him to establish a new staff			1
perhaps surprisingly , it would also prove to be a good business decision			0
" the new people that i hired were here because they wanted to be , " @entity3 said			0
" they wanted not just the company to be successful , but they wanted the company to help the city be successful			0
" an influx of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship has spiked in @entity0 , a city that suffered a population exodus and struggled to get back on its feet after @entity14 's destruction			1
the @entity58 @entity57 says that 427 of every 100,000 adults in the city started a business between 2008 and 2010 -- the most recent period for which data is available -- compared to a national rate of 333 of every 100,000 during that time			0
it is now one of the the fastest - growing cities in @entity68 , according to the @entity69			0
@entity70 recently called @entity0 one of the biggest brain magnets in the country , praising its " communal camaraderie and business incubators that have helped many of the startups get off the ground			1
" " i 've practiced in @entity0 for almost 40 years and i 'm more excited about the future of the city today , than i ever have been , " said @entity79 , owner of @entity80 and a veteran entrepreneur			1
" i 've invested a lot of my life in this community and it 's an exciting time for us			0
" this past may , @entity79 developed @entity88 , a shared workspace for local startups in a historic downtown building			0
the space is filled with 20 - something entrepreneurs in a range of fields , from tech and fashion to art and music			2
it 's currently at 65 % occupancy , and @entity102 expects it to be almost 85 % full by the end of the year			0
he said he 's observed a progression of new startups in the city in recent years -- and the catalyst for this entrepreneurial spark was @entity14			1
" what @entity14 did is move a whole new generation of young people that did n't have ties to the community , that were n't complacent , that were aggressive , that were entrepreneurial , that wanted to make a difference , socially and financially , " he said			1
@entity117 runs @entity118 , his mobile - application development company , from @entity88			0
after spending nine years in the tech industry in @entity121 , he decided to start his own company			2
@entity117 was in the process of moving to @entity39 when he heard about @entity124 , a program that brought 25 professionals from all over the country for an inside look at the entrepreneurial community in @entity0			1
@entity117 , a @entity130 native , asked city business insiders whether @entity0 could be a viable home for his company			1
" i had three key questions : is there a tech scene here ? is it sustainable ? and if i were to open a business here , would i be able to survive ? " @entity117 said			0
" and the answer was yes , absolutely			0
everybody i talked to told me , yes			0
" so he changed his articles of incorporation from the state of @entity39 to @entity130 and moved to @entity0 in june			2
@entity117 now meets with a new startup every week and networks with other web developers through groups like @entity149 and gnocode , which connect people in the city 's emerging tech scene			1
he also started his own weekly meetup , @entity155 , to help local developers make apps for @entity159 's mobile operating system			0
unique challenges still , entrepreneurs face hurdles launching and growing tech companies in @entity0 , which has traditionally lacked the startup culture now thriving in @entity165 , @entity166 ; @entity39 and other cities			1
@entity0 does not have a deep pool of developers , venture capitalists and other tech talent			1
" as companies start to scale , they need high - level management to help grow , " said @entity172 , co-founder of the @entity173 , a nonprofit that nurtures @entity0 entrepreneurs			1
" while we 're seeing people with profile start to move to @entity0 , we need more of them			1
" on the surface , @entity172 said , @entity0 would seem to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other cities			2
" we do n't have any @entity186 companies , we do n't have tremendous wealth , " he said			0
" but there 's something special here that 's making this work			0
" @entity172 sees the city as a laboratory of innovation and change			0
" i think that this is a moment in time and history where we 're right in the middle of a renaissance period , where the next generation of economic and civic leadership is being nurtured and cultivated here in @entity0 , " @entity172 said			1
entrepreneurs here say that community engagement is what makes @entity0 different			1
it 's why @entity209 chose @entity0 as home to her startup			2
a @entity214 native and @entity216 graduate , @entity212 moved to @entity0 in 2008 and taught at a charter school for one year before launching @entity218 , software that provides a centralized location for teachers to record their students ' progress			2
@entity0 has the largest proportion of students -- almost 80 % -- attending charter schools of any city in the nation			1
@entity209 believes the entrepreneurial spirit in @entity0 is unique			2
" the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem in @entity0 understands that when one rises , we all rise			2
and so as a community , business leaders here are very committed to each other 's success , because it 's all part of @entity0 redefining itself			2

entrepreneurship has spiked in @entity0 in the seven years since @entity14
a new breed of tech startups are taking root in the *rebuilding* city
entrepreneurs say @entity0 ' community spirit helps them succeed
city *resident* : " what @entity14 did is move a whole new generation of young people "
