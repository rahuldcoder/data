@entity0 -- the issues of abortion and illegal immigration will be in the spotlight over the next week , but all eyes will be on @entity7 on monday for a major player to announce his political plans			1
@entity10 or @entity0 for @entity11 ? will @entity7 gov. @entity11 run for re-election next year for an unprecedented fourth full term in office ? we should find out monday , when @entity11 is expected to make his intentions known at an event in @entity18 in front of friends and supporters			1
@entity11 to announce political future monday @entity11 was originally planning to announce his plans by the end of june but delayed his decision after he called the state legislature into a special session to try to once again pass a controversial bill that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy			1
the bill was sidetracked by a filibuster a week and a half ago by @entity34 state sen. @entity33 that grabbed national headlines			2
the conventional wisdom is that @entity11 is leaning against another term in @entity10 , as @entity7 attorney general @entity38 , a fellow @entity39 , gears up for running			1
and if @entity11 does n't run for re-election in 2014 , the thought is that he would make another bid for the @entity43 , in 2016			1
can @entity11 overcome his last presidential run ? but note that @entity11 has bucked conventional wisdom in the past			1
abortion battle resumes in @entity7 @entity7 state lawmakers on monday will resume that special session called by @entity11 , with a state senate committee holding a hearing on the abortion measure and the full @entity53 convening the next day			1
in the state house , @entity39 have already passed the bill through committee			2
it heads to the full chamber tuesday			0
large demonstrations on both sides of the issue are planned starting monday			2
@entity11 blames abortion rights activists for ' absolute anarchy ' the push in @entity7 comes after other states have passed such bans in recent years , including @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
@entity73 has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 18 weeks , and @entity77 has the tightest restriction in the country at six weeks , when a fetal heartbeat can be detected			0
and another one heats up in @entity82 the abortion issue will also be front and center in @entity82 , when state lawmakers return to @entity87 this week			1
the state @entity53 just passed a series of anti-abortion amendments that were tacked onto a bill that would ban @entity93 law			2
the measures do n't include a 20 - week provision but would place increased standards on abortion clinics and limit health care coverage for abortions			2
@entity82 joins states legislating against abortion the action now moves back to the state house , which has passed the sharia law bill without the abortion restrictions			1
meanwhile , @entity106 gov. @entity106 has expressed concerns about how the @entity39 - dominated state @entity53 rushed the passage of the anti-abortion amendments but has not indicated whether he would sign the bill			2
@entity111 has a decision to make on the federal level , sen. @entity111 is considering a request by anti-abortion groups to sponsor a bill in the @entity53 that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks , an adviser to the @entity119 @entity39 confirmed to @entity1 on wednesday			1
" i can tell you that the pro-life groups are asking senator @entity111 to sponsor the bill in the @entity53			0
he 's on a family vacation this week and will decide when he returns to @entity0 next week , " said the adviser , who asked for anonymity to speak more freely			0
anti-abortion groups push @entity111 on 20 - week ban bill @entity128 , president of the @entity129 , said her organization has been leading efforts to recruit @entity111 to sponsor the bill in the @entity53			0
" he wants to , and that 's good news , " she told @entity1 on tuesday			0
@entity129 describes itself as a group " dedicated to electing candidates and pursuing polices that will reduce and ultimately end abortion			0
" other anti-abortion groups are also urging @entity111 to sponsor the bill			0
if he does , it would give the measure added media attention , as @entity111 is one of the @entity39 's biggest stars and is considered a possible 2016 @entity39 presidential contender			0
but conservatives have criticized the first - term senator in the past couple of months for his big push for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform package that includes a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country			1
the @entity39 - controlled @entity43 passed a similar late - term abortion ban bill last month , with only six @entity39 voting against the measure and six @entity34 voting for it			2
the bill prohibits most abortions for women beyond their 20th week of pregnancy			0
while the original @entity43 bill included an exception for cases in which the health of the mother is in danger , republicans got strong pushback for not including exceptions for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest			0
@entity39 leaders later added new language to include those exceptions			0
the measure is expected to go nowhere in the @entity34 - controlled @entity53 , and the @entity43 has threatened a veto on the legislation			0
@entity180 returns with immigration fight waiting with the @entity53 passing a bipartisan immigration reform bill a week and a half ago , the spotlight has shifted to the @entity39 - dominated @entity43			1
@entity43 @entity39 meet behind closed doors wednesday to discuss their next steps			0
@entity39 leaders in the @entity43 say the @entity53 bill , which includes an eventual pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants , is a nonstarter in their chamber			0
house speaker @entity193 insists that lawmakers will craft their own bill or series of bills , separate from the @entity53 legislation			0
immigration reform looks doubtful in @entity43 as lawmakers quarrel the @entity53 bill , which passed 68 - 32 , included a last - minute , bipartisan amendment , which called for tougher border security measures , to make the overall legislation more acceptable to @entity39			1
@entity204 : @entity53 immigration bill would cut undocumented flow 33 - 50 % a bipartisan group is also working on a package in the @entity43 , though its proposals differ sharply from the @entity53 measure by making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get on a path to citizenship			2
the same day that @entity43 @entity39 powwow , former president @entity215 speaks about immigration at his recently opened presidential library in @entity7			1
the title of the event : " @entity221			0
" the former @entity39 president tried but failed to pass immigration reform during his second term in the @entity43 , thanks in part to opposition from members of @entity180 from his own party			1
@entity215 's new mission : helping those who have the least @entity1 's @entity232 contributed to this report .			2
