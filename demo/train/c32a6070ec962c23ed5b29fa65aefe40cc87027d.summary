the video of @entity1 deriding the 47 % of @entity2 " who are dependent upon government " re-ignited a debate about social class in @entity2 this week , exactly one year after the @entity8 movement first took to the streets to protest rising inequality			1
at a $ 50,000 - a - plate fundraiser , @entity1 scoffed at that 47 % " who pay no income tax " and " believe they are victims			1
" @entity1 's comments bothered many @entity2 because he seemed to be attacking some of the most vulnerable members of our society			1
aside from whether they actually " believe they are victims , " research has consistently shown that people lower on the social totem pole suffer significantly worse mental and physical health than those better off , including higher rates of heart disease , depression , suicide , several forms of cancer and death			2
yet a new line of psychological research suggests there 's another victim of inequality : the rich themselves			2
in fact , @entity1 's comments could make him the poster child for this research			2
opinion : it 's not all over for @entity1 in a series of studies , researchers have found that attaining high social status impairs key social and emotional skills			1
for instance , a 2010 study published in @entity51 found that people of higher socioeconomic status were worse at reading other people 's emotions , a skill known as " empathic accuracy , " a basic part of empathy			0
in a follow - up experiment , the researchers -- including @entity61 , my colleague at @entity64 's @entity63 -- made people feel higher or lower on the social ladder			2
regardless of their actual socioeconomic status , people temporarily made to feel upper class had a harder time reading other people 's emotions ; people made to feel lower class showed better empathy			0
this suggests that there 's something about the experience of high status that hurts our ability to connect with others emotionally			0
other studies have suggested that high status makes people less compassionate , less generous and less interested in connecting with others in general			0
here 's why the people at that $ 50,000 - a - plate dinner should care about this research : the skills that seem to be impaired by elevated status are the same skills that research has strongly linked to leading a happy , meaningful life			1
so as the super rich in this country assume an ever - loftier status above the 47 % ( or the 99 % ) , they risk depleting their own reserves of happiness			1
" being compassionate , having empathic accuracy , being trusting and cooperative -- these are keys to social connection and , in turn , happiness , " says @entity64 post-doctoral researcher @entity102 , the lead author of a study that found that people of higher socioeconomic status were less willing to share money with a stranger or make charitable donations			2
( however , when they were made to feel lower status , they became more generous ; the opposite was true for people made to feel high status -- they became stingier			0
) opinion : @entity1 better off as a @entity122 ? indeed , perhaps the dominant finding to emerge from positive psychology research over the past decade is that our happiness ( and health ) is largely determined by the quality and quantity of our social connections			1
perhaps that 's why " pro-social " behaviors and emotions -- compassion , empathy , altruism -- have been so strongly linked to happiness			1
consider : research by @entity140 , a leading happiness researcher , has consistently found that people report feeling happier after doing nice things for others			0
several neuroscience studies have found that giving to others activates pleasure regions of the brain			0
research by psychologists @entity151 and @entity152 has even suggested that spending money on others makes you happier than spending on yourself			0
and a @entity157 study published last year , led by @entity158 , found that after people supported others compassionately for just five to 15 minutes every day for a week , the compassionate people reported significant gains in happiness and self - esteem six months later			0
these findings suggest an explanation for why , once @entity2 attain an annual income of $ 75,000 , more money does n't seem to bring more happiness : beyond that point , perhaps our elevated sense of status brings with it the harmful social and emotional effects that undercut the joys of more money			1
sure enough , one recent study found that people who were wealthier , or were just temporarily made to feel wealthier , were worse at savoring everyday pleasures , a key to happiness , according to prior research			2
the research linking wealth and empathy certainly suggests one reason why @entity1 has seemed to demonstrate callousness and trouble connecting with voters on the campaign trail , with his comments about the 47 % being just the latest example			1
in light of this research , the video of @entity1 carries another troubling implication : that inequality may be self - perpetuating , making the rich less likely to feel compassion for the poor , thereby increasing the economic gap between them			1
opinion : @entity1 , @entity2 are not moochers but we probably do n't need to read too much research to appreciate how this empathy gap is bad for @entity1 's happiness			1
just look at a new @entity209 poll , which shows that he trails president @entity211 by 8 percentage points , and 43 points in the area of " connects well with ordinary @entity2			0
" follow @entity215 on @entity216			0
join the conversation on @entity218 .			0

@entity220 : @entity1 47 % comment bothered many as attack on most vulnerable
but , he says , research shows wealthy like @entity1 have impaired social emotional skills
more money linked to less *generosity* , empathy , few social connections , less happiness
marsh : inequality may be self - perpetuating ; rich less likely to feel compassion for poor
