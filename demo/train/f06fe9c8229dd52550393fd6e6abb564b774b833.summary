-- " @entity2 " fans are still reeling from last night 's epic and bloody season finale			1
spoiler alert ! we saw the returns of @entity8 ( @entity9 ) and @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , as well as possibly the resurrection of @entity13 ( @entity14 )			2
but the most disturbing twists were @entity16 ( @entity17 ) stabbing @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , and @entity20 ( @entity21 ) getting shot in the head by @entity23 ( @entity24 )			2
@entity1 talked to @entity25 about the finale and whether or not @entity20 survived the gunshot wound			1
what did you think when you read the season finale script ? well i mean , i knew ahead of time that it was coming			1
it 's always a scary place as an actor to go there			1
i do n't know what their plans are for next season			1
i know that @entity43 has said there are " big plans , " but i do n't know what that really means , and things can always change			1
i 'm not for sure , but i trust him completely			2
at the end of the day , it 's hard to see how i 'm coming back , seeing as half of my head was just blown off			1
they may figure something out			2
i mean it 's @entity2			1
there 's all this crazy stuff			1
but i 'm excited either way			2
if it does all end , i 've had the most amazing time of my life			1
in your mind , is @entity20 dead ? well i mean half my head is missing			2
i 'm just gon na keep saying that			0
you know , it 's " @entity2			1
" i feel like anything is possible			1
if anything , it is the golden hour though			0
if she is able to be saved , it 's like she 's got 20 seconds			1
it 's not a lot of time			1
i 'm curious to see what they 're going to do with all of it			0
i hope i 'm back			0
but again half my head is missing [ laughs ]			0
maybe @entity20 will just wear a lot of hats ? yeah i mean yeah she can wear a lot of hats			0
put some gauze on it			0
but people are going crazy ! [ @entity96 ] it was crazy ! are people approaching you ? well my phone has been blowing up			0
i talked to @entity17 and his phone was blowing up			0
he was like , " people are about to start a riot over you			0
" i think that 's so sweet to know that people out there are really upset and some people are like , " i 'm not watching the show anymore ! " i 'm like , c'mon guys			1
but it 's not over			1
it ai n't over til the fat lady sings			1
i 'm just gon na take it one day at a time			1
as i said , i have n't seen any scripts from next season , but i know that i 'm involved -- i just do n't know in what way			1
are you signed on for a season 5 ? yeah			0
it 's out there that @entity43 has already said that he has big plans for @entity20			1
i do n't know exactly what they have in store for me and how long that will be			1
and if i did know , i 'm just not going to say			0
[ @entity96 ] but again -- half the head is missing			0
the cool part is people are talking			0
and that 's the question is : is she dead or is she not ? because people can survive head wounds			1
but we have people on the show that can make things happen -- you know what i mean ? i do n't know what 's going to happen the first episode of next season			1
i 'm just as excited and curious you are			0
i hope it 's good			2
i hope i stick around for a while			0
[ @entity96 ] was it emotional shooting that scene on the kitchen floor ? it was emotional			0
i think we all went out afterwards -- me , @entity24 and @entity153 -- just to sort of have a little celebration			0
but it was very very emotional			0
i do n't think there was a dry eye when we shot that scene			2
it 's very clear the relationship when @entity20 goes , " i would die for you			2
" basically , i would take a bullet for you			0
that 's not necessarily a best friend -- she 's like my sister			2
i think it was so amazing to see that			2
to see her walk in and go , " oh , uh - uh			0
" that goes to show you how much love @entity20 has			2
@entity153 in that moment i think played it so beautifully , and it was hard for me because i was like , " okay , play dead			0
