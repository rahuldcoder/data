( @entity4 ) -- miles from the main roads , in rural @entity8 , soccer balls bounce unevenly			1
playing fields are arid , lush , weedy , sandy — any flattish space will do			0
goalposts might be made of gathered mahogany or driftwood			0
some feet are bare , others shod in fraying sneakers , boots , rubber sandals			0
yet children kick and chase handmade , lopsided balls with skill and abandon , competing for pride and joy — for the sheer pleasure of playing			1
has the " beautiful game " ever been lovelier ? @entity30 does n't think so			1
in 2010 , when the @entity33 came to @entity8 for the first time , the @entity32 - based photographer set out to see what soccer looked like far from the bright lights and big stadiums			1
what she found — over seven months , ten countries , and 12,500 miles — was a grassroots game where passion trumped poverty , a do - it - yourself ethic prospered , and one ball could " bring happiness to an entire village			1
" in the 30 - odd soccer - loving localities she visited , in countries from @entity8 to @entity50 , balls are spun into being with whatever 's at hand : rag or sock , tire or bark , plastic bag or inflated condom			1
each might last days or months on a field of gravel or hard earth			0
wherever @entity63 went , she swapped the store - bought balls she kept in her car for these " ingenious little jewels , " most of which were made by children			2
