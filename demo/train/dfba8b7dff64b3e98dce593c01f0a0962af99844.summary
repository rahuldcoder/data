-- if you 've been weighing buying a new @entity3 or @entity4 but are holding out for one of @entity7 's rare discounts , @entity1 is your chance			1
as it 's done in recent years , @entity7 is holding a " one - day shopping event " for the day after @entity9			1
a page on @entity7 's site invites @entity1 shoppers to visit its online store ; it 's not clear whether the same deals will be offered at the company 's retail stores as well			2
@entity7 's promotional copy touts " @entity4 , @entity19 and @entity3 gifts			1
" conspicuously absent is any mention of deals on the new @entity22 , which starts at $ 199 ( with two - year wireless - carrier contract ) and will probably not be discounted			0
in typically cryptic fashion , the company is n't offering specifics on its seasonal markdowns			0
but the blog @entity29 published what it claims are some leaked details : modest discounts of $ 101 on @entity3 , $ 41 - $ 61 on @entity4 ( depending on storage capacity ) and $ 21 - $ 41 on @entity19			1
those would be in line with the @entity1 deals @entity7 offered last year , although the company only marked its @entity4 down by $ 41			1
@entity29 also says some accessories , such as @entity4 covers , will be discounted friday			2
there was no mention of any deals on @entity42			0
an @entity7 spokesman declined to comment wednesday on the report or on potential discounts			0
even at a briefly discounted price of $ 458 , the cheapest @entity4 has new competition this holiday season from smaller , less expensive tablets like @entity50 's @entity49 ( $ 199 ) and @entity52 's @entity51 ( $ 249 )			1
@entity53 also has slashed the price of its 7 - inch @entity56 tablet from $ 499 to about $ 200 , depending on the retailer			0
some observers also had expected @entity1 to mark the debut of @entity7 's huge new retail store inside @entity62 's iconic @entity61			2
but according to tech - news blog @entity65 , a @entity0 content partner , construction workers at the site do n't expect the store to open until december .			0
