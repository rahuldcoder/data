-- a @entity2 appeals court ruled it was too early to consider a motion to release a black teenager who allegedly took part in beating up a white classmate in @entity7 , @entity2 , last year			1
@entity8 , 17 , is accused with five others of severely beating @entity7 in a school fight			1
the tuesday ruling is the latest turn in the racially charged saga of a group known as the @entity7 -- six black teens initially charged with attempted murder after they allegedly knocked out classmate @entity7 and stomped him during a school fight			1
five of the teens were charged as adults			2
civil rights groups and other organizations have marshaled thousands of people to march on @entity7 on thursday , a day originally slated for 17 - year - old @entity8 's sentencing hearing on battery and conspiracy convictions			1
however , a district judge earlier this month tossed out @entity8 's conviction for conspiracy to commit second - degree battery , saying the matter should have been handled in the juvenile court			1
on friday , the 3rd @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity2 , did the same with @entity8 's battery conviction			2
a three - judge panel ruled tuesday , however , that it would not consider a motion to free @entity8 from prison			1
" the motion for release from custody , filed by the defendant in this court , is premature , " the panel ruled without setting a date for considering the motion			1
the future of @entity8 's case is up to the district attorney , who must decide whether to refile the charges in juvenile court , @entity8 's attorney @entity46 said last week			1
charges against four of the teens -- @entity8 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 -- have been reduced to battery and conspiracy			1
@entity54 and @entity53 have not gone to trial			0
@entity55 has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial is scheduled for november 26			0
@entity61 and an unidentified juvenile remain charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder			0
advocates of the @entity7 say the story began well before the december 4 beating			1
they say it began in september when three white students decided to hang nooses from a tree on campus			1
in september 2006 , a black student asked the vice principal if he and some friends could sit under an oak tree where white students typically congregated			1
told by the vice principal they could sit wherever they pleased , the student and his pals sat under the sprawling branches of the shade tree in the campus courtyard			2
the next day , students arrived at school to find three nooses hanging from those branches			0
according to @entity92 in nearby @entity93 , the school 's principal recommended expulsion for those behind the nooses			0
instead , the newspaper reported , a school district committee suspended three white students for three days for hanging the nooses , a gesture written off as a " prank			1
the district attorney was summoned to address the student body			0
off - campus fights were reported			0
on november 30 , someone torched the school 's main academic building			0
the arson remains unsolved , but many suspect it was linked to the discord			0
four days after the arson , several students jumped @entity7 , knocking him unconscious before stomping and kicking him			2
parents of the @entity7 say they heard @entity7 was hurling racial epithets			0
@entity7 's parents insist he did nothing to provoke the beating			2
@entity7 was taken to a hospital with injuries to both eyes and ears as well as cuts			0
his right eye had blood clots , said his mother , @entity125			0
he was treated and released that day			0
bails for the @entity7 were set at between $ 70,000 and $ 138,000			2
all but @entity8 posted bond			0
the judge has refused to lower his $ 90,000 bail , citing @entity8 's criminal record , which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them			2

thousands expected to march in @entity7 on thursday to *protest* charges
appeals court does not set a date for hearing a motion to release @entity8
