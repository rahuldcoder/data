-- it appears that the police now have a device that can read license plates and check if a car is unregistered , uninsured or stolen			0
we already know that the @entity7 can dip into your @entity9 page and @entity12 searches			0
and it seems that almost every store we go into these days wants your home phone number and zip code as part of any transaction			0
so when @entity20 -- now cooling his heels in @entity22 -- revealed the extent to which the @entity7 is spying on @entity24 , collecting data on phone calls we make , it 's not as if we should have been surprised			1
we live in a world that @entity29 predicted in " 1984			1
" and that realization has caused sales of the 1949 , dystopian novel to spike dramatically upward recently -- a 9,000 % increase at one point on @entity35			1
comparisons between @entity29 's novel about a tightly controlled totalitarian future ruled by the ubiquitous @entity39 and today are , in fact , quite apt. here are a few of the most obvious ones			1
@entity46 -- in the novel , nearly all public and private places have large tv screens that broadcast government propaganda , news and approved entertainment			0
but they are also two - way monitors that spy on citizens ' private lives			0
today websites like @entity9 track our likes and dislikes , and governments and private individuals hack into our computers and find out what they want to know			1
then there are the ever - present surveillance cameras that spy on the average person as they go about their daily routine			1
the endless war -- in @entity29 's book , there 's a global war that has been going on seemingly forever , and as the book 's hero , @entity73 , realizes , the enemy keeps changing			1
one week we 're at war with @entity76 and buddies with @entity78			1
the next week , it 's just the opposite			2
there seems little to distinguish the two adversaries , and they are used primarily to keep the populace of @entity78 , where @entity73 lives , in a constant state of fear , thereby making dissent unthinkable -- or punishable			2
today we have the so - called war on terror , with no end in sight , a generalized societal fear , suspension of certain civil liberties , and an ill - defined enemy who could be anywhere , and anything			1
doublethink -- @entity29 's novel defines this as the act of accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct			1
it was exemplified by some of the key slogans used by the repressive government in the book : war is peace , @entity108 is @entity111 , @entity107 is strength			2
it has also been particularly useful to the activists who have been hard at work introducing legislation regulating abortion clinics			0
the claim is that these laws are only to protect women 's health , but by forcing clinics to close because of stringent regulations , they are effectively shutting women off not only from abortion , but other health services			2
@entity126 -- the fictional , stripped down @entity128 language , used to limit free thought			0
@entity131 , @entity130 serious ? that 's so fubar			2
memory hole -- this is the machine used in the book to alter or disappear incriminating or embarrassing documents			0
paper shredders had been invented , but were hardly used when @entity29 wrote his book , and the concept of wiping out a hard drive was years in the future			1
but the memory hole foretold both technologies			0
@entity144 -- this was an organization set up to take the pleasure out of sex , and to make sure that it was a mechanical function used for procreation only			0
organizations that promote abstinence - only sex education , or want to ban artificial birth control , are the modern versions of this			2
so what 's it all mean ? in 1984 , @entity73 , after an intense round of " behavior modification " -- read : torture -- learns to love @entity39 , and the harsh world he was born into			1
jump forward to today , and it seems we 've willingly given up all sorts of freedoms , and much of our right to privacy			2
fears of terrorism have a lot to do with this , but dizzying advances in technology , and the ubiquity of social media , play a big part			0
there are those who say that if you do n't have anything to hide , you have nothing to be afraid of			0
but the fact is , when a government agency can monitor everyone 's phone calls , we have all become suspects			1
this is one of the most frightening aspects of our modern society			0
and even more frightening is the fact that we have gone so far down the road , there is probably no turning back			0
unless you spend your life in a wilderness cabin , totally off the grid , there is simply no way the government wo n't have information about you stored away somewhere			0
what this means , unfortunately , is that we are all @entity73			0
and @entity39 is the modern surveillance state			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			1

@entity205 : we live in age where authorities , companies collect information about us
he says after @entity20 spying *revelations* , sales of @entity29 's " 1984 " spiked
he says elements like " doublethink " and " endless war " have *parallels* today
@entity205 : in a modern surveillance state , we 're all suspects
