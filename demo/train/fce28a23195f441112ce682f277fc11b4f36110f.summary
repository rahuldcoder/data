-- @entity1 suggested in a statement tuesday that he will not accept @entity4 's proposal to move him and " @entity5 , " which he 's hosted for seven months , to 12:05 a.m. et. @entity4 has proposed moving " @entity5 " from its traditional 11:35 p.m. slot so that the show 's former host , @entity7 , could host a half - hour show then			1
" my staff and i have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of ' @entity5			1
' but i can not participate in what i honestly believe is its destruction , " @entity1 said			1
" some people will make the argument that with dvrs and the @entity21 a time slot does n't matter			0
but with the @entity5 , i believe nothing could matter more			1
" there has been speculation about my going to another network but , to set the record straight , i currently have no other offer and honestly have no idea what happens next			0
my hope is that @entity4 and i can resolve this quickly so that my staff , crew , and i can do a show we can be proud of , for a company that values our work			1
" @entity39 's full statement after @entity7 left " @entity5 " last year -- as part of an agreement reached six years ago giving it to @entity1 -- he began hosting " the @entity44 " for @entity4 in the fall , airing at 10 p.m. et. but ratings for the 10 p.m. show were low , and on sunday , @entity4 announced that it was taking @entity7 out of the prime - time slot because the show " did n't meet affiliates ' needs " despite performing at acceptable levels for the network			1
the last show will air february 11 to make way for the @entity55 , which airs starting february 12			0
@entity56 , chairman of @entity57 , said the plan was for @entity7 to host a new , half - hour show at 11:35 p.m. et , followed by " tonight " with @entity1 at 12:05 a.m. and @entity61 's " @entity62 " show moving to 1 a.m. as of sunday , @entity4 was still negotiating with the three hosts over the proposed lineup			1
@entity65 : share your view on the late - night shakeup @entity1 , in his statement tuesday , said the plan was n't acceptable			1
" for 60 years the ' @entity5 ' has aired immediately following the late local news			2
i sincerely believe that delaying ' @entity5 ' into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what i consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting , " @entity1 said			1
" ' @entity5 ' at 12:05 simply is n't ' @entity5			2
' " also , if i accept this move i will be knocking the ' @entity62 ' show , which i inherited from @entity80 and passed on to @entity61 , out of its long - held time slot			0
that would hurt the other @entity4 franchise that i love , and it would be unfair to @entity61			1
" @entity86 's president of entertainment , @entity85 , told reporters on monday that his network may be interested in @entity1 should he leave " tonight			1
" " i love him , " @entity85 said at the @entity91 press tour in @entity92 , @entity93			0
" it 's a very compatible fit for our brand			0
he is one of the few guys in the planet who has demonstrated he can do one of these shows every night			0
" in monologues on their respective shows on monday , @entity7 and @entity1 had zingers about the looming shakeup			2
" @entity4 said the show performed exactly as they expected it would and then canceled us			2
do n't confuse this [ with ] when we were on at late night and performed better than expected and they canceled us			0
that was totally different , " @entity7 quipped			0
@entity1 had the following to say on his show monday : -- " good evening , i 'm @entity1 , the new host of ' @entity115 with @entity116			2
' " -- " this weekend no one was seriously hurt , but a 6.5 earthquake hit @entity93			0
the earthquake was so powerful that it knocked @entity7 's show from 10:00 to 11:35			0
" -- " on the positive side , i have learned a valuable lesson from all this : never sign a contract that ends with the word ' not			0
