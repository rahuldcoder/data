hankering to see some happy feet ? @entity1 is far from your only option			0
from the windswept beaches of @entity6 at @entity8 's tip to sunny @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11 , @entity12 , penguin colonies exist in many strikingly beautiful destinations in the @entity14			1
there 's no denying it : penguins are among the most charismatic creatures			1
their notorious curiosity , waddling gait and comical body language seldom fail to charm			0
but these flightless sea birds have evolved over 15 million years to become strong , nimble swimmers that often migrate long distances in pursuit of fish following seasonal ocean currents			0
7 prime spots for wildlife viewing today , most of the 18 species of penguins are in decline because of climate change , habitat destruction , pollution and overfishing -- in fact , more than half are considered endangered			1
you can support their survival by visiting carefully managed colonies where tour operators respect penguin habitat and educate visitors about conservation efforts			1
november through march -- when it 's the warmest in the @entity14 -- is prime time for viewing many penguin species			1
during the warm season , they spend more time on shore to breed , nest and raise their young			1
check out these amazing penguin spots : @entity6 ( @entity60 and @entity61 ) @entity62 , @entity60 , the southernmost city in the world , boasts several tour operators offering day cruises to view penguins and other marine life			1
but only one , @entity69 , gives visitors the chance to walk among the penguins			1
@entity69 runs two six - hour tours daily from the port of @entity62			1
tours are limited to 20 people , so be sure to make reservations well in advance			1
a 90 - minute minivan ride takes visitors through @entity82 forests and along secluded pebbly coves before arriving at @entity84 , a charming family - owned farm and marine center			0
from there , visitors transfer to a boat for a short ride to @entity91 , a research station that monitors the 3,000 pairs of @entity95 penguins and a small colony of gentoo penguins that nest here between september and april			2
visitors will spend up to an hour observing the very vocal @entity95 penguins , which bellow and strut along the beach by the hundreds			2
the tour guide will instruct you to maintain a safe distance from the birds , but be prepared for them to approach you as penguins can be extremely curious			2
after a few minutes on the beach , you 'll be led up a bluff to see their nesting ground , where the birds often return to the same mate and same nest year after year			0
back at @entity84 , you 'll have time to grab a hot drink at the tea room or explore the farm 's on - site marine research center			0
there is also a guest house and camp sites ; contact @entity121 directly if you want to extend your visit to this peaceful haven			0
otherwise , @entity62 offers a wide range of accommodation options , from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels perched on glacial mountainsides overlooking the city			0
@entity69 , @entity130 $ 95 for a six - hour tour ( 50 % discount for children under 12 ) , plus $ 13 entry fee to @entity84 @entity134 , @entity12 since the 1920s , tourists have flocked to @entity134 to witness the smallest penguin species , known as little penguins or fairy penguins , return to shore each evening to feed their young after a long day of fishing			1
only 12 inches tall and weighing less than 3 pounds , the little penguin is found only in @entity12 and @entity143			1
for decades , the penguins on @entity134 were largely unprotected from the throngs of sightseers , but today most visitors observe the evening penguin " parade " from elevated boardwalks and viewing platforms to minimize disturbances to the birds			1
for those who want a more up - close - and - personal experience , a limited number of tickets are available each day for small group , ranger - guided tours where you can walk among penguins on a secluded beach			1
the ticket price helps support conservation work on the island , including habitat restoration and research focusing on how penguins are affected by climate change , development and invasive species			1
@entity134 is a 90 - minute drive from @entity11 , but plan on spending at least a couple of days here to enjoy all its wildlife , including koalas , wallabies , elusive anteaters , seals and whales			0
@entity182 , prices start at @entity130 $ 23 for evening viewing from a platform , $ 46 for close - up viewing and $ 82.50 for a private , ranger - guided ecoadventure in a part of the penguin colony that 's closed to the general public			1
@entity9 , @entity10 the southern tip of @entity10 offers numerous opportunities to view the @entity192 penguin , previously known as the jackass penguin because of its distinctive donkey - like bray			2
@entity192 penguins have declined by 80 % in the past 50 years because of pollution , development , climate change and irresponsible tourism activities			2
the @entity202 colony , about 24 miles from @entity9 , was only established in 1983 , but it 's now an important habitat for the endangered bird			0
as its name suggests , the beach is strewn with granite boulders , which create an impressive backdrop for photographing the penguins			2
today , boardwalk viewing areas help protect the birds from excessive human contact , although you may encounter penguins while swimming and should take care not to approach them if possible			1
a ride on the wild side in @entity220 @entity202 is part of @entity222 , situated at the convergence of the @entity225 and @entity226 oceans on the @entity227			2
hiking , mountain biking , wind sailing and wildlife viewing are just a few of the activities here that offer impressive views of @entity9 and the surrounding countryside			2
the nearby village of @entity239 , with its historic cottages and cobblestone streets , provides numerous accommodation and dining options			0
@entity222 , visitors to the park pay a daily conservation fee of @entity130 $ 5.30 per adult and $ 2.50 per child			2
@entity248 , @entity143 even in a country known for its dramatic scenery and amazing wildlife , the @entity248 stands out			0
located on @entity143 's @entity253 , the peninsula was born of volcanic eruptions that created steep mountains and rugged sea cliffs			0
it 's a hot spot for marine wildlife viewing -- seals , sea lions , elephant seals and , of course , penguins			1
here it 's possible to see both the little penguin and the rare yellow - eyed penguin			2
a number of tour operators on the peninsula are committed to environmental education and sustainable ecotourism			0
@entity272 offers naturalist - led tours as well as lodging that emphasize sustainability and support penguin habitat restoration and conservation			1
another option is @entity280 , a conservation reserve on a private farm			2
visitors begin the tour by learning about penguin conservation efforts before proceeding to a series of trenches and observation huts			1
from these vantage points , they are treated to up - close views of a yellow - eyed penguin colony while minimizing disturbances to the birds , which live in coastal forests and have suffered significant habitat loss from logging			2
@entity272 , a sunrise tour of a yellow - eyed penguin colony , maximum six people , runs @entity130 $ 75 per person			2
nature packages , which include two nights at a @entity304 cottage , sunrise penguin tour and a daylong tour of the @entity248 , run $ 540 per person			0
note that tour priority is given to those staying at the cottage			0
@entity310 , penguin tours run throughout the day			1
@entity312 is u.s. $ 41 for adults and $ 10 for children			0
budget accommodations are available at the @entity316 for u.s. $ 22 adults , $ 8.50 children @entity318 , @entity319 it comes as a surprise to most travelers that a trip to the @entity318 could include the chance to see penguins			1
but in fact , the islands are home to the only penguin that lives in a tropical climate			0
unlike other species that migrate according to the season , endangered @entity318 penguins live here year - round , especially in the colder waters of the western islands such as @entity336			1
almost any tour of the @entity318 includes the chance to see an incredible variety of wildlife , but some operators specifically offer penguin tours			1
more likely than not you 'll be observing the birds from a boat , but if the tour includes snorkeling in an area frequented by penguins , there 's a chance that you could end up swimming with the birds			0
@entity352 , a member of the @entity354 , is one tour operator that offers the chance to see penguins at close range			0
however , since the @entity359 restricts tourists to specific areas and may limit access depending on conditions , it 's best to contact tour operators directly to confirm that you 'll be able to see penguins on your trip			0
talk through the options carefully with the booking agent to make sure your expectations will be met			0
@entity373 , four to 15 - day @entity318 cruising tours with an @entity372 - speaking guide , start at around u.s. $ 3,000 up to about $ 6,000 , including the flight from @entity375 to the @entity318			0
ask to speak to a @entity318 expert and tell them you are interested in seeing penguins so they can find an appropriate tour during your travel dates			0
avoid holiday travel unless you book a year or more in advance -- tours around @entity386 and @entity387 fill up fast .			0
