-- why did @entity1 , one of the greatest historians of modern times , remain a @entity4 after the end of the @entity6 , and defend communism into the 21st century ? to be a man of @entity1 's generation was to have experienced the collapse of capitalism in the @entity12 , to be a jew of @entity1 's generation was to have seen the rise of @entity16 and @entity17			1
in those years of the 1930s , the years when @entity1 was a brilliant youth , was to face what seemed to be a binary choice , to be with the @entity21 or against them			1
and no one seemed to be more against the @entity21 than the communists			2
@entity1 joined the @entity24 as a very young man , and was loyal , in his way , to the end			1
@entity28 also offered , as perhaps no non-religious ideas do today , a sense of community			1
to belong to the @entity24 was to have a sense of conspiracy , a loyalty to friends who had suffered and would suffer more , and a collective sense that the struggle was not in vain , for a more glorious world could and would come			2
like religion for @entity42 , who repeat that " things happen for a reason , " communism offered a logic of pain and progress			2
every arrest , every sentence to a concentration camp , every execution was not just a moment of horror , but further proof of capitalism 's decadence and weakness			1
the story was that communism could consolidate a generation because it transcended any generation			2
the motor of history was changes in means of production			2
as the basic structure of the economy changed , the traditional feudal order in the countryside gave way to capitalism in the cities			2
once industry was built and working classes become massive , the people would claim the fruits of their own labor , and the factories and the cities would be shared by all			0
private property took the place of original sin : with the revolution , that stain would be removed , and we would return to our original nature , and we would be good and peaceful as well as prosperous			0
the story had a logic , but it also required an element of faith			0
the faith and the logic had to work together , and in a mind such as @entity1 's , one of the great minds of the 20th century , logic could keep faith in the shadows			1
but it was always present , and perhaps in the end it was dominant			0
communists could be great historians ( fascists could not ) , because communism provides history with a plot			0
but because communism in the 20th century was not just an idea but a political reality , its story slowly transformed from one of prophecy to one of retrospective editing			0
the @entity6 , to borrow @entity114 's term , " really existed , " and its policies of mass killing were widely known : the deliberate starvation of millions of @entity131 in 1933 , the mass shootings of peasants and ethnic minorities in 1937 and 1938 , the alliance with @entity17 in 1939 , the executions of @entity124 prisoners of war in 1940 , the postwar domination of eastern @entity117 , the crushing of reform movements in @entity120 and @entity121 , and all the rest			1
in @entity1 's extraordinary history of the modern world , the last part is the weakest , in part because he must face this problem of a @entity6 that itself poses a problem for a communist scheme of history			1
it did not bring what communism promised , and then it came to an end			0
but the idea that history is a grand story with a wonderful conclusion did not			0
over the course of the @entity152 , we in the @entity150 , and especially in @entity42 , came to think of history as having a plot , just one which happened to be the reverse of the communist one			0
private property must stay , not be abolished			0
the state must shrink , not grow			1
the rich are not villains , but heroes			0
capitalism does not bring its own collapse , but expanding stability			0
if we followed these simple prescriptions , then a utopia would await us as well			0
the end of the @entity6 was understood by many of us not as an end to ideology , but as proof that our ideology was the better one			1
just why @entity1 thought as he did , wrote as he did , and lived as he did is a matter that is beyond the judgement of any one of his colleagues , and there are people far better equipped than i to judge			1
but i would like to advance one simple thought			0
@entity1 was certainly loyal to the memory of old comrades , and he was certainly sentimental about his own youthful past			1
in his old age , i suppose without any kind of certainty , he found himself in a historical moment , our own , which still seemed like an age of ideology , with his own ideology in the weaker position			0
and he was a fighter			0
as he edited the past according to his own ideology , warping history in a way that can only be troubling , he was defending a @entity6 state that no longer existed , and ideas which seemed dead			1
but wrong as it was , it did embody certain virtues			1
there is something to be said , after all , for defending the weak , even today , especially today			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

historian @entity1 stayed loyal to @entity209 until his death at *95*
@entity207 says @entity1 's beliefs formed as a jew living in 1930s
@entity207 : @entity1 defended @entity6 state that no longer exists , and other dead ideas
wrong as was , @entity207 writes , it did embody certain virtues that are valid today
