" yes , i identify as black or @entity2 , but i am not a @entity3 , " said a 25 - year - old teacher from @entity1			1
on monday , when @entity4 took the day off from work to report for jury selection , she was not prepared for what she called an offensive and disgusting experience			0
the juror information card all prospective jurors have to fill out included a race category that included , " @entity2 , @entity2 , or @entity13			1
" " are you kidding me ? what year is this ? " @entity4 thought when she read the form			0
when @entity4 looked around , no one else in the room was apparently concerned by this , she told @entity20 on friday			0
since the words " black , @entity2 , or @entity13 " appeared as a part of a single category , @entity4 crossed out the word " @entity3 " and wrote next to it , " offensive ! it 's 2014 ! " she then snapped a picture of the form and posted it on her @entity30 page			1
@entity4 returned the form to a court employee , hoping for some sort of reaction , but there was none , she said			0
with grandparents from @entity37 who lived through the @entity39 laws of racial segregation , @entity4 said she is especially offended by the contemporary use of the word " @entity3			1
" it is outdated and has a negative connotation , @entity4 said			0
" i do n't think it was malicious , " said @entity44 , a professor of history at @entity46			0
" @entity3 " has been used from the late 1900s all the way to the @entity49 and beyond , @entity44 explained			2
there were times when the word was used to describe educated and empowered african - americans , he said			0
there have been various terms that have been embraced by different generations of african - americans , @entity44 said , and " @entity3 " was one of them			2
the term lost popularity with the arrival of the baby boomers and the black pride movement , according to @entity44			2
" i believe there are many black people who still prefer that term , " said @entity44			2
" it is a generational issue			0
" it would be a problem if the word " @entity3 " appeared on the form by itself , he said friday			2
race categories for @entity1 courts come from the @entity75 , according to @entity76 , a spokeswoman for the @entity77			1
the courts are required to collect demographic information about prospective jurors , per @entity80			2
as of september 13 , 2010 , every person who appears for jury service in any city in @entity1 must complete a scannable data card , which includes specification of race , according to the statute			1
however , the statute only uses the word " black " when referring to blacks or african - americans			0
according to a 2010 blog post by then director of the @entity75 , @entity94 , the word " @entity3 " was used in the 2000 census as a result of research in the late 1990s that showed approximately 56,000 people wrote in the word " @entity3 " under the " some other race " category			1
more than half of these individuals were under the age of 45 in 2000			0
in the 2010 census , many respondents found the use of the word " @entity3 " outdated and offensive , according to a press release by the bureau			2
@entity94 apologized to those who were offended			0
" i am confident that the intent of my colleagues in using the same wording as @entity117 was to make sure as many people as possible saw words that matched their self - identities			0
full inclusiveness was the goal , " @entity94 wrote			0
following the negative feedback , the @entity75 conducted research on race and @entity127 origin using what it called the @entity129 , according to the press release			1
the study found that removing the term " @entity3 " does not have an impact on data quality and therefore recommended removing the term for future data collection			1
the @entity75 , which follows the @entity137 for definitions of race and ethnicity , discontinued use of the word " @entity3 " at the beginning of 2014 , according to a press release			1
@entity1 courts will be following suit and discontinuing the use of the word soon , according to @entity76			1
" collecting demographic data is really important ; however , they may have had a technical hiccup in their choice of language , " said analyst @entity148 of the @entity149			0
not all states collect demographic information from prospective juror , @entity148 told @entity20			1
it is a good thing that @entity1 courts do this in order to ensure a fair cross-section of the community , he explained			1
the @entity149 created its own form for prospective jurors , which does not include the word " @entity3			1
" according to @entity76 , this is the first time officials have heard of anyone being offended as a result of the race categories on juror information cards			2
