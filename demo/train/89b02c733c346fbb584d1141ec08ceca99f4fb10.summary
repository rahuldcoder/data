a fisherman convicted of throwing evidence of an illegal catch overboard received strong support from the @entity4 wednesday , with a number of justices dramatically calling the criminal prosecution a case of government overreach			1
federal prosecutors used a law typically applied to corporate records to convict commercial angler @entity13 of getting rid of three illegally caught grouper			1
the question is whether the congressional law against obstructing an investigation into business practices is too vague			1
it was passed in the aftermath of @entity22 and other big accounting scandals of that kind			0
an especially spirited hour of oral arguments had the high court wondering whether the @entity29 administration went too far in going after a " little fish " like @entity13			1
" he could have gotten 20 years , " thundered justice @entity31 , visibly concerned			0
" what kind of a sensible prosecution is that ? " but justice @entity36 suggested , " the fact that this is about any matter within the jurisdiction of any agency in the @entity41 shows that it 's really not just about corporate fraud , that @entity44 had a broader set of things in mind , " which she said " suggests breadth			0
" retired justice @entity49 was among those attending the public session in the courtroom , where all parties smartly avoided using any bad fish - related puns			2
the actual legal language in dispute involves efforts to conceal , cover up , falsify , or make a false entry in any record , document , or " tangible object			0
" it is known as the " shredding provision , " referring to the destruction of paper and electronic evidence			2
it applies to " the investigation or proper administration or any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency " of the @entity41			2
@entity13 , 62 , owns the @entity75 , a commercial fishing vessel moored near @entity77 , @entity78			1
it was operating in the @entity80 in 2007 when state officers working with the @entity82 boarded the vessel			0
inspectors discovered 72 undersized red grouper and told the skipper to leave his catch there and head back to shore so agents could seize it			0
when the @entity75 @entity75 arrived at port days later , @entity13 says a government inspector counted only 69 fish that were below the 20 - inch minimum harvesting size			1
the captain still claims the deputy originally miscounted the fish			2
prosecutors alleged @entity13 had ordered his crew to throw the smaller fish overboard , and charged him with destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation			1
a jury eventually convicted the @entity107 man and he spent 30 days in federal prison , avoiding a possible two - decade sentence			1
the @entity110 said @entity13 does not dispute now that he " directed the destruction or concealment of the fish " and officials will argue that the law used to prosecute him does apply , since it " encompasses all physical evidence " that might be deliberately tampered or destroyed			1
in the broader sense , the @entity29 administration says the so - called 2002 @entity121 law has widely been used to go after obstruction of justice , including " human bodies , bloodstains , guns , drugs , cars , and automobiles -- in order to cover up offenses ranging from terrorism and the unreasonable use of lethal police force , to violations of environmental and workplace - safety laws			0
" @entity13 says the conviction has hurt him economically and wonders why the government was so insistent they " have a pound flesh " by prosecuting him for what he called a simple civil infraction			1
his lawyer , a federal public defender named @entity143 , warned the bench that " the breadth of the statute regarding any federal matter is an extraordinary thing that the @entity41 people will be walking on eggshells for if this court were to not limit			2
" that met some mild resistance from some on the bench , who offered various hypotheticals about which " tangible objects " could be used to prosecute for obstruction			0
would a typewriter , portable electronic device , or a knife with the owner 's name inscribed be included ? " i understand the argument that you make has considerable force about over criminalizing , but it seems to me that the test you suggest has almost more problems with vagueness , more problems with determining what its boundaries are , than the government 's test , " said justice @entity164			0
" what sense does it make to say you can be indicted under ( this provision ) if you destroy a letter that the victim that you have murdered has sent you , but you ca n't be indicted under ( the provision ) if you destroy the murder weapon ? " asked justice @entity178			0
as another example , " a letter is shredded			0
it 's a letter from the victim to the later - turned - out - to - be murderer			0
does that come under ( the provision ) ? " on the other side of the debate , many on the court saved their rhetorical firepower for the @entity110 's lawyer @entity199 , who at times struggled to assure the court that the federal government would not prosecute every fish destruction case			1
" but the point is that you could , and the point is that once you can , every time you get somebody who is throwing fish overboard , you can go to him and say : look , if we prosecute you , you 're facing 20 years , so why do n't you plead to a year , or something like that , " said chief justice @entity210			1
" it 's an extraordinary leverage that the broadest interpretation of this statute would give federal prosecutors			2
" justice @entity218 cautioned that if a line could n't be drawn , " it seems to me that the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is a real one			0
" justice @entity224 said the government was " asking the court to swallow something that is pretty hard to swallow			0
" do you deny that this statute , as you read it , is capable of being applied to really trivial matters , and yet each of those would carry a potential penalty of 20 years , and then you go further and say that it is the policy of the @entity110 that this has to be applied in every one of those crazy little cases ? " he asked			0
" perhaps @entity44 should have called this the @entity241 , " @entity164 said , prompting laughter in the courtroom			0
the justices will not retry the facts -- some of which remain in dispute -- but only will consider whether the law was properly applied			2
in the coming days , the court will privately vote on the outcome , and a written ruling is expected within the next few months			1
several on the bench made reference to a case last term in which the high court unanimously vacated the criminal conviction of a @entity260 woman for violating an international treaty on the use of chemical weapons			2
@entity264 sought revenge on a romantic rival by sprinkling non-lethal amounts of chemical powders on her onetime friend 's mailbox and doorknob			0
all nine justices said the federal government was overzealous in pursuing what normally would be a simple assault charge handled in state court			1
in the current dispute , a number of legal and political advocacy groups have rallied to @entity13 ' cause , saying " misuse " of government discretion to use criminal law rather than civil law to handle a range of regulatory enforcement is hurting the justice system			1
the case is @entity13 v. @entity41 ( 13 - 7451 ) .			1
