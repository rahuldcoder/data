@entity1 gov. @entity0 said monday night that former @entity4 gov. @entity3 's steps toward a run for the 2016 @entity7 presidential nomination would have no bearing on his own decision about whether to jump into the race , a decision he will make later this year			1
@entity3 's announcement last week that he was " actively exploring " a run was a blow to @entity0 's ambitions because the two men will be competing for many of the same donors as they test their viability as candidates			1
but @entity3 will be leaning on a far deeper network of financial supporters that came together to back the winning presidential campaigns of his father , @entity26 , and his brother , @entity28			1
many of those donors were intrigued by @entity0 before the @entity30 scandal broke earlier this year			1
during an hour - long interview with @entity32 on @entity33 , @entity0 said his decision would be based solely on three factors			1
" is it right for me ? is it right for my family ? is it right for the country ... if i answer ' yes ' to all three of those things then i will run			0
if i do n't answer ' yes ' to all three then i wo n't , " he said			0
@entity32 pressed him on how much a run by @entity3 would affect his plans			1
" it 's not one of the three questions , " @entity0 said with a faint smile			1
he did not elaborate on his thoughts or make any comments sizing up @entity3 as competition			1
@entity0 , who has faced many questions about his temperament as he has moved on to the national stage , also waved off questions about whether his brusque and sometimes confrontational manner would wear well over time			1
@entity32 noted that @entity0 's demeanor has in many ways been " his calling card " and how he gets " stuff done , " but asked whether he would modulate his behavior to appear more " presidential			1
" " no , " @entity0 responded with characteristic bluntness			2
" why would i ? it 's who i am			2
" " if people want somebody different , then if i ever ran for president , they 'd vote for somebody different , " he said			0
" i do n't intend to become a phony to win an election			0
" related : poll : @entity80 not ready for ' @entity82 ' president @entity0 added that members of the public rarely ask him about those traits , and argued that the subject is an obsession of reporters			2
in a recent incident where he told a heckler to " sit down and shut up , " he noted that many news outlets only ran that sentence without showing him let the man " yell , go on , block the cameras with his signs , speak over me , get booed by the crowd			0
" the governor said he told the man that he would talk to him later -- a part , he said , that often gets edited out of the footage -- but that he stood by his direction to the heckler to sit down and shut up			2
" i do n't regret that for one second and i would n't change that part of myself , " he said			0
" what you all do , " he said , referring to the media , " is to take that small part and say ' look at him , all someone had to do was stand up and something , and bang , he says sit down and shut up			0
' " " people like to watch that , " he said			0
he joked that his sometime unpredictable demeanor was one reason why people were tuning in to monday night 's hour - long interview			2
" i do n't think they 've seen me punch you yet , " he said to @entity32			0
" but they live in hope			0
