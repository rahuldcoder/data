-- for many girls in @entity2 , the simple act of walking to school can be a life - threatening journey			1
" you close the door behind you , and you enter a war zone , " said @entity6 , an @entity7 - based author and scholar who was raised in @entity2			1
there were at least 185 documented attacks on schools and hospitals in @entity2 last year , according to the @entity16 , and the majority of those attacks were attributed to armed groups opposed to educating females			1
but " the walk from home to school is -- and has always been -- the most dangerous part , " @entity6 said			2
" you are told to stay covered , keep your head down and walk quickly ... and stare at your toes			0
" the life of a schoolgirl in @entity2 is a far cry from reading , writing and arithmetic			1
some girls have been maimed by acid attacks			1
others have had their drinking water poisoned or been targeted by bombers who think females should be forbidden from school -- as they were during the @entity40 's rule			2
" it is unfathomable that anyone would want to hurt them			0
but that is the reality , " said @entity44 , a documentary filmmaker who recently traveled to @entity2 to work on a feature film about girls ' education			1
amid the violence , however , there is promise : in a country where just 6 % of women 25 and older have received any formal education , millions of girls are at long last enrolling in school			1
ten years ago , fewer than a million @entity2 children attended school , according to @entity60			1
today , more than 8.2 million children are going to schools like the one founded by @entity63 , one of the @entity64			1
@entity63 and her team at the @entity66 are providing a free education to about 350 girls in rural @entity2			1
" most of the ( local ) men and women are illiterate , " @entity63 said			0
" most of our students are the first generation of girls to get educated			2
" who should be @entity77 ? cast your vote the obstacles facing @entity2 girls are both " herculean and heartbreaking , " @entity44 said			1
while she was filming at one school , there was an attack at another school nearby that killed 100 children			2
that very same day , @entity44 watched as young students embraced their opportunities to learn			0
" to see these girls walking to school , delighted to be learning and spending time together in the classroom , writing their own names for the first time , reading their first words -- i felt hope for the future , " @entity44 said			1
" not in a naive way but with the realization that if it 's working here , it can work other places , too			0
" although the violence against @entity2 schoolgirls has dominated news headlines recently , reports from humanitarian groups like @entity60 , @entity106 and @entity107 say that a great deal of progress has been made			1
" the overall education of girls in @entity2 is a great success story , " said @entity110 , spokeswoman for @entity107 in @entity2			1
" basically , you did n't have girls educated in 2001			1
and now we have 3 million girls in school			1
" @entity110 says there 's still much work to be done , however , because there are approximately 4 million children in @entity2 -- most of them girls -- who are not enrolled in school			1
one major area of focus is the number of female teachers			0
" in @entity2 culture , parents do n't consider it appropriate for girls to be educated by a man , " @entity110 said			1
" there is a high dropout rate of young girls after the early grades because there are not enough female teachers			1
so the secret of getting and keeping girls in school is to get more female teachers			1
" only 31 % of all teachers in @entity2 are female , @entity110 said , and a disproportionate amount of those women are in urban areas			1
the lack of infrastructure in rural areas also makes it even more difficult for girls to get an education there			1
" there are 400 rural districts			0
in 200 of them , there are no female teachers or girls ' schools , " @entity110 said			1
" when i am talking to parents , they are favorable to girls ' education			1
but the schools and teachers need to be close and safe			2
" to improve those rural numbers , @entity107 has implemented high school training programs so girls can become teachers right after graduation			1
another obstacle to girls ' education is early marriage			1
the legal age for marriage is 16 in @entity2 , but there have been many reports about girls being forced to marry well before that			1
@entity44 and her production crew met a 12 - year - old student named @entity182 whose marriage had been arranged by her brother , the oldest man in her family			2
" the way kids in @entity7 might trade baseball cards on the playground , these boys traded their sisters : ' my sister will marry you ; your sister will marry me , ' " @entity44 said			0
" now it is @entity197 's fiance and her fiance 's father who dictate her life			0
" among the first decrees : no more school			2
" knowing this is often the case , @entity63 goes to the homes of some of her young students and asks for permission to delay marriage			0
in some cases , she 's had success			0
in others , she has seen students forced to withdraw from school			2
" my heart breaks for them , " @entity63 said			0
" hopefully , things will change			0
many fathers and grandfathers are proud to see their girls learning , so there are positive signs			0
" still , across an already greatly divided country , old gender biases are hard to undo			0
" you can have these huge kinds of variations and attitudes about education within the same family , " @entity6 said			0
" i met a young female math teacher whose own family was split greatly on the topics of education			0
she told me her own cousin was very proud that he never sent his daughters to school			0
he thought it was the worst thing you could do			0
" in some cases , physical and emotional abuse keep girls out of the classroom			0
many young women are accustomed to being hit and working as virtual slaves at home			0
@entity63 recalls asking a young student a question and seeing the child put her hand in front of her face , afraid she would be struck			0
" she and her sister had burn marks and scars on their bodies , " said @entity63 , who stepped in to provide clothes and food for the children and threaten the girl 's aunt with arrest			0
according to the @entity16 , violence against women has been persistent in @entity2 due to women 's low status and the country 's long exposure to hostilities and conflict			2
gender discrimination can also be traced to a combination of factors , including poverty , local tradition and the effects of war			0
but female students still have high aspirations			0
in a recent @entity106 survey ( @entity281 ) , more than 70 % of the girls interviewed said they want to continue their education			2
" once they enter the classroom , they are so involved being a student and trying to learn as much as they can , " @entity63 said			0
" they want to learn			0
they want to get educated			0
" advocates like @entity63 and @entity107 agree that if true change is to come in @entity2 , it 's crucial to educate this next generation			2
@entity2 has one the highest proportions of school - age children in the world : about one - fifth @entity2 are between the ages of 7 and 12			1
@entity110 said that 57 % of all @entity2 are children			2
" they form the future @entity2 that some in the international community are afraid of and others might want to ignore , " she said			2
" but it is paramount to look at these children and get the best education for them			0
" these children are the @entity2 we are looking at in 10 or 15 years			2

millions of @entity2 girls are now getting the education that their mothers could n't
but as a result , the girls and their schools are often targets for violent attacks
girls ' education is also *hamstrung* by arranged marriages at an early age
@entity64 @entity324 founded a school that teaches @entity2 girls for free
