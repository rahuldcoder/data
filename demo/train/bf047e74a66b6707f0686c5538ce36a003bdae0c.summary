there is an old saying among soldiers and correspondents who cover them that when two people drink from the same canteen in some desert , jungle or other war zone they have a bond for life			2
this came to me in the middle of the night last night as i failed to make sleep come hours after learning that my friend and long - time colleague @entity16 had lost his life			1
@entity19 took him in a car crash in @entity22			1
@entity16 and i had drunk from the same canteen more than once during the 48 years we had known each other , 38 of those working together at @entity27			1
once , in @entity28 i think it was , we were talking over an adult beverage or two in the shank of an evening about dangerous assignments , a subject about which @entity16 was experienced and expert			1
with a piercing look and a hint of that slightly off - center smile he sometimes had , he said something along the lines of , " more correspondents are injured getting out of the shower and more are killed in automobile accidents than probably anywhere else			2
" the irony of that memory mixed with how death took him is painful and lingers			2
i 've been trying for a long while to come up with an adequate way to describe how devastating @entity16 's loss is to those of us who knew him , to @entity27 and to quality journalism			1
but words are failing me			2
he was one of the best writers ever to work in television journalism			1
he was a master of expressing so much with so few words , perfectly chosen and ordered			2
but @entity16 's words were more than just pretty or evocative			1
they were not there to stand on their own ceremony			2
they were chosen to convey information , important information , and lots of it			2
@entity16 could and often did write like a poet , but his every fiber was that of a journalist			1
he was old school , in the style of @entity75 : notepad , shoe - leather , play no favorites , pull no punches and go where the action is			0
to look at @entity16 's roll call of overseas postings is to see the embodiment of a foreign correspondent			1
from @entity85 to @entity86 to his specialty , the @entity88 , @entity16 thrived on difficult and dangerous assignments			1
his bravery was matched only by his unwavering professionalism			0
and yet , even here @entity16 's story is incomplete			1
he did n't just witness history , he strived to understand it			0
yes , he was fearless when bullets were flying , but he also never blinked when staring down a despot or thug in an interview			0
he knew when he was being lied to or toyed with , and rather than shirk from the challenge , he would embrace it and become more determined to expose the truth , or as close to the truth as possible			0
@entity16 was sophisticated , one of the few genuine " scholar correspondents " in television			1
he was extremely well read , urbane and poised			0
he also had a good sense of humor and sometimes was downright funny			0
there was no issue he could n't cover , no story he could n't tell			0
television is of course a visual medium , but with a @entity16 piece , if you closed your eyes and just listened , that was often enough			1
his words and his voice had that power			0
it was a privilege to know him , an honor to have worked with him			0
my deepest condolences go to his widow @entity124 , and their beloved daughter , @entity125 , herself a very accomplished journalist			0
i also mourn with the rest of the @entity27 family			0
@entity16 was the very best of that network 's news traditions			1
he had unbounded curiosity and uncommon compassion			0
he searched out stories that he felt were important , and then brought them to light with an elegance and intuition that will be sorely missed everywhere that good journalism is valued			2
and within the " @entity140 " offices , his absence will be felt especially keenly : the twinkle in his eye , the joke , the story , just @entity16 being @entity16 , all of that gone in an instant			1
now , only memories remain			0
that and the example he set			0
may you continue to inspire those of us left behind			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1
