-- in a @entity3 hospital , a two - year - old girl is fighting for her life after a teenager brought her there three weeks ago , unconscious with severe head injuries and bruises , fractured arms and human bite marks covering her tiny body			1
all of @entity11 began following her ordeal through newspapers and television			2
doctors operated on the toddler , opened up her airways and placed her on a ventilator			0
they named her @entity19 , which means sky			1
her condition remains critical , said dr. @entity23 of the @entity11 @entity24			0
no one knows whether she will survive or if she does , whether she will live with permanent brain damage			0
but that 's just the tip of the story			0
with each day , it becomes more sordid			0
once police began investigating @entity19 's back story , they unearthed a suspected ring of human trafficking			1
the details sparked new outrage among authorities and the public alike , who say the case raises a host of questions about child abandonment , exploitation and the poor treatment of girls and women in the world 's second most populous nation			2
" this has turned out to be one of the biggest sex rackets involving minors and child prostitution and sale of women for marriage , " said @entity51 , head of @entity11 's @entity52			0
" this shows this is a classic case where the magnitude of trafficking has come to light			1
" @entity11 came to know of @entity19 after a distraught teenage girl , only 14 , brought the baby to the hospital , claiming to be her mother			1
on the night of january 17 , the baby just kept crying and crying , the teenager told the @entity52 in @entity3			1
angered by the tantrum , the girl slapped the baby three or four times -- and bit her			2
a while later , she said , the baby slipped on a wet bathroom floor and fell on her face			0
the girl tied a bandage around the baby 's head but the wound began to swell			2
the next day , when the baby did not wake up , the girl took her to the hospital			1
the doctors said @entity19 was bruised the color of eggplant and beets			1
she was in a coma			0
they did not believe the girl 's story			2
nor that she was @entity95 's biological mother			0
" my personal opinion would be that it does n't look like a simple case of falling down , " said dr. @entity96 , a neurosurgeon at the hospital			1
she was referred to a juvenile center for counseling and police launched an investigation			2
@entity105 deputy police commissioner @entity104 formed five teams to fan out across @entity11 to track down @entity19 's real family			1
what police learned in the subsequent weeks was shocking			2
the teenage girl ran away from home last june to escape abuse from her alcoholic father			1
the father failed to pay rent , his landlady told @entity0 's sister network @entity119			0
a neighbor described him beating his daughter so hard that her red welts were readily visible			0
" i have seen with my own eyes how her father used to beat her up with a stick , " @entity123 told @entity119			0
but her escape led the teenager to more trouble			0
she told authorities two people , @entity134 and @entity135 , forced her into a life of prostitution ; that @entity134 allegedly raped her first for three days before he found her customers , according @entity119			1
months later , the girl met a man named @entity141 and the two began living together in a @entity3 slum			1
police suspect he , too , was sexually abusing the girl			1
the girl told authorities that @entity141 brought @entity19 home in november			1
it 's unclear whether the baby was abused then but on that january night , @entity19 almost died			1
" once victim hurting another victim because there is no sense of hope , sense of survival they can see for themselves , " psychiatrist @entity151 told @entity119			0
in the western state of @entity162 , police eventually tracked down @entity163 , 22 , the woman believed to be @entity19 's biological mother			1
she had been abandoned by her first husband and sold off in marriage when she was 16 to a young man from a @entity170 village , @entity104 said			0
she was valued at $ 6,000 , according to @entity171			0
@entity163 left her three children behind			0
" the family life was very disturbed , " @entity104 said			2
" she was convinced that she would not be able to raise @entity19 on her own			1
" while @entity163 's youngest fought for her life in the hospital , police found her other daughter in the state of @entity180 , many miles from @entity3 and @entity162			1
her son 's whereabouts are still not known			0
police scored a breakthrough in the case friday when they were able to nab @entity141 , the man they believe is central to the possible trafficking ring			1
he was caught absconding at the @entity3 train station , @entity104 said at a news conference			1
in all , police have arrested 10 people so far who are believed to have profited greatly from their crimes			1
no one knows how many babies were abandoned , how many women were married off for a price or how many girls were forced to sell their bodies			0
the case prompted @entity11 's home ministry to review police reports and consider action and reignited national debate on a serious problem in @entity11			2
a 2011 @entity207 danger poll ranked @entity11 as the fourth most dangerous place on earth for women , behind @entity211 , @entity212 and neighboring @entity213			0
the survey said 100 million women and girls are involved in prostitution and 50 million are " missing " in the last century because of female feticide and infanticide			0
almost 45 % of girls are married off before they reach adulthood			0
prasad of the @entity52 called the problem " huge			2
" he said @entity11 needs more comprehensive laws on the books and stronger enforcement			0
this sort of thing happens all too often , @entity51 said , and sadly , flies under the radar of a majority of @entity11 's 1.2 billion people			2
but now , a hapless child fighting very publicly for her life has thrust an ugly side of @entity11 society into the national spotlight .			2
