@entity0 -- the opening scenes to a massive highway project dubbed " @entity5 " have so far been free of traffic jams , officials said saturday			1
the construction project is shutting down this weekend a mountainous 10 - mile section of a @entity0 highway that 's one of the nation 's busiest freeways			1
motorists have been told to stay home to avoid massive gridlock			0
" so far , ' @entity5 ' is an excellent sequel , " @entity0 fire capt. @entity16 said			1
" @entity5 " repeats last year 's closure of the same section of @entity19 , which had been expected to be so apocalyptic that @entity0 residents labeled the weekend shutdown " @entity5			1
" the theatrical play on words captures @entity0 ' love affair with the automobile -- and its dread of common traffic jams -- but last year 's evacuation of the highway went smoothly , causing no paralysis			1
the drama is heightened by how the closed portion of the 405 overlaps the @entity33 of the @entity34 -- one of only two major highways over the range			1
no major traffic jams had been reported by saturday evening			0
a mile - long backup near the south end of the project had been cleared by midday			0
@entity43 , spokeswoman for the @entity44 , said residents so far had heeded warnings to stay home or in their communities			2
officials continued to advocate the use of public transportation			0
because last year 's closure went well , officials were concerned this year about ultra-gridlock out of a fear that motorists may get behind the wheel this weekend out of excessive confidence and complacency			1
" the risk factors that caused transportation , law enforcement and emergency response agencies heartburn during last year 's i - 405 freeway closure have not changed , " said @entity60			1
the 405 , as it 's locally called , connects suburban @entity67 with @entity68			2
it also stretches into the well - to - do neighborhoods of west @entity0 , such as @entity71 and @entity72			0
specifically , the 405 was closed between @entity73 and @entity74 101			2
crews were taking down a portion of the @entity78 bridge to make room for a wider roadway			0
the bridge is being reconstructed			0
road crews will continue this weekend 's shutdown of the 405 until monday morning , and the reconstruction is expected to finish on time , said @entity60 , an executive director of the @entity86			1
the highway construction project this weekend will complete a carpool lane system over the mountain pass to create a continuous carpool lane of almost 73 miles in each direction between @entity93 and @entity94 's @entity67 -- the longest in the world , officials said			1
highway reconstruction will continue until 2013 , when the overall $ 1.34 billion project is scheduled for completion , officials said			0
improvements include new bridges and ramps , officials said			0
@entity44 maintenance crews were taking advantage of the closure to pack in extensive maintenance , according to wonder			2
the list included cleaned culverts , removal of debris , tree trimming , striping and the application of rubber sealant on the roadway			0
