@entity1 , @entity0 -- new technology devised by a @entity6 firm , @entity3 is turning sessions at the gym into clean renewable electricity			1
the @entity3 device snaps on to the front of all major brands of indoor cycling equipment			1
it 's a workout that hopes to work out some of our energy problems and offers a glimpse of what could be achieved if we all do our bit for the environment			0
the first devices were recently installed on seventeen bicycles at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity6			0
the energy generated is fed straight into the club 's electricity control cabinet where a grid - tie inverter pumps energy back on to the grid			2
the new venture is the brainchild of founder and ceo of @entity3 , @entity36			2
it was during recovery from a shoulder injury that @entity36 -- a former partner at management consultants , @entity40 -- first had the idea to create a machine than could harness human power			0
" i realized that there has got to be a way to take the energy that i was expending trying to rehabilitate my shoulder to create something useable , " @entity36 told @entity2			0
enlisting the help of an engineer , @entity36 has spent the past 18 months perfecting the machine and has created a highly adaptable device which snaps on around the wheel of the bicycle			1
" we did n't want people to have to purchase new cycling equipment			1
so we 've made it so it fits on to all major brands of cycling equipment , " @entity36 said			1
" a wire runs out from the bottom of each bike and connects to an electrical control cabinet			0
" so far , @entity36 has received positive feedback from gym members who have used the equipment , and with the help of an interactive carbon calculator people can measure how much energy they are generating from their workout			1
the output from a single workout is only enough to power a light bulb or a laptop for about an hour and saves between two to six ounces of @entity76			0
but power generation starts to stack up as more people get in the saddle			0
@entity3 estimate that a group of around 20 bikes used throughout a year has the potential to create 3,600 kilowatt hours of electricity			1
that , they say , equates to lighting 72 homes for a month			0
@entity36 says that there are around 36,000 health clubs in the @entity88 alone , so the potential is there for the equipment to make a worthwhile impact on carbon emissions			1
" if every club had one , " he said , " then that would create a substantial amount of energy			0
" @entity3 say that their technology can easily be attached to most other types of cardio equipment			2
so if pedal power is n't your thing , you can use a cross trainer or a step machine to burn away those calorie and carbon ounces			0
along with health clubs , @entity36 is hoping that the corporate and university markets will prove lucrative for the company			1
he says that orders are already starting to roll in from all parts of the @entity88			2
in 2009 , @entity36 plans to take his @entity3 to the @entity117 market .			2
