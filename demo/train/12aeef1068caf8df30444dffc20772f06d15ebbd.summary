@entity0 -- chasing stories on soccer star @entity4 for rival papers put a strain on the relationship between former newspaper chief @entity8 and @entity10 spin doctor @entity9 , a court heard wednesday			1
@entity11 , @entity9 and five others are on trial facing phone hacking charges , including conspiracy to intercept the voice mails of high - profile figures in @entity18			1
@entity11 , the former chief executive of @entity22 's @entity18 newspaper arm , @entity23 , and onetime editor of the @entity25 and @entity27 newspapers , has denied having a long - running affair with @entity9 but said they were close			1
continuing her defense testimony wednesday , @entity11 told the court how her personal relationship with @entity9 affected their professional relationship when she was editor of @entity27 and he was editor of sister paper -- yet fierce rival -- @entity25			1
@entity9 became editor of the @entity25 after @entity11			1
" it was our own fault complicating the friendship , " @entity11 told @entity0 's @entity38 court , saying they had previously been good at keeping a " @entity39 " between the two newspapers			1
she said their professional relationship became especially strained in april 2004 when the @entity25 broke a story about an alleged affair by @entity4			0
it had put out a " spoof " edition on a saturday evening , and @entity27 would not know about the story until it reached newsstands			0
other newspapers such as @entity54 and @entity55 , however , learned about the story before @entity11 , who said : " i was not best pleased about that situation			1
" she told the jury she knew @entity4 and his wife , @entity60 , socially and would occasionally go out to dinner with them to try to encourage the sports star to write for the paper			0
" @entity9 would have known that i had a direct line to the @entity4 , " she said			1
when asked if she would have hesitated in stealing the story , she replied , " no , probably not			0

the prosecution said the affair ran from 1998 to 2004 -- during some of which time both @entity11 and @entity9 were married to others -- and it revealed the level of trust between the defendants			1
testifying in her defense friday , @entity11 said there were periods of physical intimacy at that time , including from 2003 to 2005 , when her marriage to actor @entity91 was breaking up , and again briefly in 2006			1
@entity11 also told the court wednesday about how she learned while on vacation in @entity95 in 2006 that police had raided the @entity25 offices and royal editor @entity98 had been arrested , accused of intercepting voice mails of members of the royal household			1
she described initial confusion about the allegations , saying she almost certainly would have called @entity9 , who was then editor of the @entity25 , to find out what was going on			2
" it was a huge news story if nothing else , " she said			2
private investigator @entity108 was also arrested on phone hacking charges			1
@entity11 said there was a " certain amount of grumpiness " from the @entity27 team in reaction to the allegations at the @entity25			2
" they ( the @entity27 team ) felt they were cheating by intercepting voice mails , " she said			0
@entity11 said police later told her that @entity108 had hacked her own phone for 18 months			1
she said she was " pretty shocked " about being hacked and " certainly surprised " because she had a personal pin code and thought it would be secure			0
in a raid on @entity108 's house , police found notebooks with reference to @entity91 , @entity11 ' former husband			2
she said she met with police because " being a journalist by nature , " she wanted to find out as much as possible about how the investigation into the @entity25 was going			0
they gave her no indication at that stage they were investigating any wrongdoing at the @entity25 during her editorship , @entity11 said			2
she told the court she later agreed with senior management at @entity27 not to pursue a case against @entity108 over the hacking of her phone			2
@entity108 and @entity98 were jailed after pleading guilty to phone hacking in 2007			1
a job offer and ' a delicate situation ' @entity11 told the court she believed a line had been drawn under the phone hacking scandal after @entity98 and @entity108 were sentenced			1
she had lunch with @entity98 shortly after his release from prison in april 2007 and offered him a job because he was taking @entity23 to an employment tribunal over his dismissal while he was in prison			0
she told the court he was alleging that other people at @entity23 knew he was accessing voice mails , that others knew about the practice and were involved in it			0
@entity11 said she had " a very sound belief that there was no foundation to these allegations			2
" " it was a delicate situation			0
@entity98 was angry he had been dismissed			0
he felt he had been unfairly treated by the company , " she said			0
@entity98 did not take up the job offer			0
@entity173 of missing schoolgirl 's voice mails on tuesday , @entity11 denied ever having approved the practice of phone hacking while editor of the @entity25			1

but asked by her defense attorney if she was ever asked to sanction the practice while editor of the @entity25 , from 2000 to 2003 , she said : " no. " questioning focused tuesday on the @entity25 's actions in the case of 13 - year - old @entity187 , a @entity18 schoolgirl who went missing and was later found murdered in 2002			0
the @entity25 was closed down in july 2011 amid public outrage over allegations that its employees hacked the young girl 's voice mail messages while she was missing			0
@entity11 said the first time she heard the newspaper had accessed @entity198 's voice mails was on july 4 , 2011 , and she was shocked			2
she was on vacation during the week that the @entity25 hacked @entity198 's phone , she testified , and it was not brought to her attention			0
her then - deputy , @entity9 , was editing the paper that week , she said			2
last week , @entity11 was cleared of one of two charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office , at the judge 's direction			1
