-- what is @entity3 's legacy ? the eulogies have focused on his decision to pull @entity7 settlers out of @entity8 in 2005 under the so - called " disengagement plan			1
" @entity11 @entity10 ban ki - moon praised @entity14 's " political courage and determination			1
" @entity16 secretary of state @entity15 said @entity14 " surprised many in his pursuit of peace			2
" the reality is that @entity14 's withdrawal from @entity8 portended no courage to change his pro-settlement , virulently anti-palestinian policies			1
since the 1970s , when he planned and helped establish 64 @entity27 settlements , @entity14 had earned his moniker as " the father of the settlements			2
" his evacuation of 21 settlements in @entity8 and four in the @entity27 seemed surprising , indeed			0
but the removal of settlers must be seen in the context that overall during @entity14 's term as @entity7 's prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , the number of @entity7 settlers in the @entity27 , including @entity38 and the @entity39 , increased from roughly 388,000 to 461,000			1
@entity14 's legacy is deeply disturbing			1
he went to his grave without facing justice for terrible things he did			0
his death is a grim reminder that impunity for human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law has plagued @entity7 and the @entity54 for far too long			1
it mattered little to @entity14 that @entity7 's transfer of its civilians into @entity54 territories wasâ € ” and isâ € ” a grave breach of the @entity60 and a potential war crime			1
it mattered even less that the settlement regime and @entity7 's military rule in these areas subjects @entity54 to severe discrimination and a mountain of restrictions that makes life miserable			0
part and parcel of this settlement expansion plan was @entity14 's construction of the @entity7 separation barrier , which today stands as a monument to human rights violations			1
@entity14 's government approved its construction in 2002 , ostensibly to prevent @entity54 attacks that killed 640 @entity7 civilians during his term			1
but the real motivation for the barrier , as countless studies have documented , was to build a wall around the @entity7 settlements , deep into the @entity27 , cutting off thousands of @entity54 from the rest of the @entity27			0
worse , he avoided prosecution for the killings of civilians in which he was implicated : a fact that deserves not eulogy , but infamy			1
@entity98 and @entity15 could n't very well mention it , but history will remember @entity14 for his role in the massacres of civilians by @entity105 militias in the @entity106 in @entity105 in 1982			1
from september 16 to 18 , the militias killed at least 700 people , and perhaps more than 2,000 , including infants , children , pregnant women and the elderly , some of whose bodies were found to have been mutilated			0
@entity14 , as @entity7 's defense minister in 1982 , had overall responsibility for the @entity116 , which controlled the area of the camps			2
according to a document prepared by his office , @entity14 's instructions on september 15 , the day before the massacres began , included : " for the operation in the camps the @entity124 should be sent in			1
" in february 1983 , the @entity127 , @entity7 's official commission of inquiry investigating the events , found that @entity14 bore " personal responsibility " for the massacre			2
there was a " serious consideration ... that the @entity124 were liable to commit atrocities , " the commission reported , but " from ( @entity14 ) himself , we know that this consideration did not concern him in the least			0
" his " disregard of the danger of a massacre " was " impossible to justify , " the commission found , and recommended his dismissal as defense minister			0
although he did resign as defense minister , in a glaring example of gross impunity for crimes against @entity54 , @entity14 remained in the @entity7 cabinet as a minister without portfolio and later became prime minister , serving until his stroke in january 2006			2
similarly , @entity153 , the @entity124 leader the @entity127 named as responsible for directing the militias , also escaped prosecution and served as a @entity105 cabinet minister until being killed by a car bomb in 2002			0
the massacres constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity			0
yet @entity7 justice authorities did not conduct a criminal investigation to determine whether @entity14 and other @entity7 military officials bore criminal responsibility			0
@entity7 also made sure that no one else could bring @entity14 to justice , either			0
in 2001 , survivors from @entity169 and @entity170 brought a case in @entity172 requesting @entity14 be prosecuted under @entity172 's " universal jurisdiction " law			2
political pressure from the @entity16 and @entity7 -- it " was like nothing i have ever seen , " said a colleague who closely followed the issue at the time -- led @entity172 's parliament to amend the law in april 2003 , and to repeal it in august			0
@entity172 's highest court dropped the case against @entity14 that september			2
many in @entity7 are now highlighting @entity14 's record as a warrior and bold political leader			1
but it is worth pausing to consider his record as a man who brought devastation and destruction to the lives of thousands of @entity54 , without ever facing justice for his crimes , and whose policies undermined efforts to achieve peace between @entity7 and the @entity54			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity204 : while eulogies praise @entity3 , his legacy is actually disturbing
@entity202 : @entity14 's pro-settlement , virulently @entity210 policies were *harmful*
she says he avoided prosecution for the killings of civilians in which he was implicated
@entity202 : his death is a grim reminder that impunity for human rights abuses still occurs
