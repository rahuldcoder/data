it 's late in @entity1 on a dark night , moonless or with heavy clouds			1
suddenly the silence is broken by sonic booms , followed by the sound of jets roaring overhead			0
flying in tight formation , @entity8 fighter planes drop bunker - busting bombs on a nuclear enrichment plant built into the side of a mountain			1
@entity1 pilots race for their own jets to fight back , but by the time they take to the sky , it 's too late			1
the @entity8 jets streak away			2
that , at least , is what @entity8 would like to happen if it decides to attack @entity1 in an effort to prevent it from acquiring the ability to make nuclear weapons			1
but would it be as easy for @entity8 to destroy @entity1 's nuclear sites as it was for the jewish state to strike an @entity30 reactor in 1981 or a suspected one in @entity32 five years ago ? experts inside and outside @entity8 say no. they envision a much more complicated attack , one that would involve more than 100 planes -- from fighters to refueling tankers -- flying hundreds of miles to bomb up to eight targets around @entity1			1
possible site of @entity1 explosive tests identified , think tank says @entity8 hit one target each in @entity30 and @entity32 , but @entity1 's nuclear assets are spread over multiple sites in different parts of the country			1
one is buried under concrete			0
another is dug into a mountain			0
surface - to - air missiles and electronic warfare systems protect them all			2
they also are significantly farther away from @entity8 than the targets in @entity30 or @entity32			1
and they may not be the only sites @entity8 would need to destroy to achieve its goal			2
bombing @entity1 nuclear facilities would be " very complicated , " said @entity62 , deputy director of @entity8 's @entity63			1
" it is a very large - scale operation , much greater than the one carried out in @entity30 30 years ago , " said @entity62 , a former colonel who served with an intelligence research division in the @entity8 military			1
@entity8 would most likely attack @entity1 with fighters jets -- the @entity70 and the @entity71 -- rather than missiles fired from submarines , @entity62 and other experts said			1
" in order to create proper damage to the nuclear plants , you need extremely accurate weapons , " @entity62 said			2
" i do n't know that the missiles are accurate enough			0
" according to the @entity80 - based defense analysis group @entity79 , @entity8 has one squadron -- about 25 planes -- of @entity84 jets , which are similar to the @entity86 fighters of the @entity87			1
@entity8 calls its version of the fighter @entity89 , or @entity91			2
it has four squadrons of @entity93 , the @entity8 version of the @entity95 @entity71			2
the @entity8 jet is known as the @entity97 , or @entity98			2
the @entity8 fighters lack the range to reach most of the likely targets in @entity1 , so @entity8 would also need to put tanker aircraft into the sky , said @entity104 of the @entity105 in @entity80			1
@entity8 has at least seven @entity107 tankers that it could use for airborne refueling , @entity104 said			2
it also has at least four @entity110 tankers , versions of the giant @entity113 aircraft , but is not likely to use them because their slow speed means the jets would need to slow down to link with them , wasting fuel , he said			0
the strike aircraft would carry bunker - busting @entity122 bombs -- 5,000 - pound bombs to " go after hardened and buried sites , " @entity104 said			0
each @entity84 could carry up to three bunker - busters , he said , depending on whether they are configured to carry the maximum number of bombs or the largest possible amount of fuel			0
the @entity95 military has an even larger bunker - buster , the 30,000 - pound @entity131 , but there 's " no indication the @entity8 have requested that weapon " or that @entity8 has the @entity135 or b - 52 bombers needed to deliver it , @entity104 said			1
like other experts , he based his analysis on the assumption that if @entity8 mounted an attack , it would do so without @entity95 help			1
there would be at least four primary targets , said @entity144 , a nuclear expert at @entity147 and @entity148 nuclear enrichment plants , the @entity150 uranium conversion facility , and the @entity152 nuclear complex			0
@entity150 and @entity152 are above ground and are " relatively vulnerable to aerial attack , " she said			0
but @entity147 , in the center of the country , is buried under 33 feet of earth and 6 feet of concrete , @entity144 said , making it " very hard to penetrate			0
" @entity148 , near the holy city of @entity161 , is " even more difficult " because it is deeply buried in a mountain , she said			0
dropping a bunker - busting bomb on @entity148 actually might make it less vulnerable , @entity144 said , since collapsing the entrance without destroying the facility would protect it from further bombing			0
" it 's questionable whether @entity8 is capable of destroying it in an air - launched attack , " she said			1
" just getting @entity147 and @entity152 without getting @entity148 would n't be worth the risk , " she argued , since @entity148 is enriching uranium to higher levels than the other sites			0
all four targets are protected by @entity177 and @entity179 surface - to - air missile batteries , said @entity144 's colleague , @entity180 , a specialist in land - based air defense			1
@entity8 would have at least two secondary targets as well , @entity144 predicted -- the @entity184 and @entity185 missile bases in the west , " to prevent a retaliatory missile attack " on @entity8			1
it also could try to strike the controversial @entity189 military base east of @entity190 , which inspectors with the @entity191 have been trying to visit , @entity144 said			0
@entity8 also might target the @entity193 military base , which suffered a mysterious explosion in november			0
that would bring the number of potential targets to eight			0
@entity1 's single declared civilian nuclear reactor probably is safe , @entity144 said			1
an attack on the @entity201 reactor would risk spreading nuclear contamination , and could mean killing @entity204 personnel at the @entity204 - built facility , infuriating @entity206			2
@entity8 has three potential routes of attack , according to @entity209 's and other experts , assuming its fighters do not fly all the way around the @entity213			1
@entity209 's says the @entity8 @entity87 does not have enough refueling capacity to travel that distance			2
the northern route would go through @entity217 , with which @entity8 has tense relations			0
the southern route would go through @entity221 , which fears its rival @entity1 getting a bomb but is openly hostile toward @entity8			1
the central route is the shortest			0
it runs through @entity225 and @entity30			0
@entity225 and @entity8 are at peace , but there 's no guarantee @entity225 would formally give @entity8 permission to fly over its territory			2
@entity30 air defenses , meanwhile , " can not prevent violations of sovereignty , " said @entity232 of @entity233 's			0
that makes it the " most likely location for air refueling			0
" @entity8 will need to decide what altitude its planes would fly at on the way in			2
flying higher would protect them from the defenses of the countries they fly over , but will expose them sooner to @entity1 radar			0
" you 're going to be in the cockpit three hours - plus before you get to the target unless you go the central route , " said @entity104 , the @entity105 ' senior fellow for military aerospace in @entity80			0
he doubts the @entity1 would be able to detect them coming that far away			0
" i do n't imagine them having two hours ' notice			0
the @entity8 will be desperate to give them as little notice as possible			0
" they will try to ensure their aircraft remain below their radar as long as possible , " he said			0
" if you 're in an @entity8 fast jet you do n't want it to be anything like a fair fight			0
" @entity104 noted the @entity8 military 's success in attacking a suspected nuclear site in @entity32 in 2007			1
" the @entity8 , with a mix of electronic warfare and electronic attack , degraded @entity32 air defenses to the point where they did n't see the strike package coming in , " he said			1
" can the @entity8 pull off tactical surprise the way they did with the @entity32 in 2007 ? going after three or four strike targets is much harder , " he said			2
@entity1 's air force has @entity95 - made @entity275 acquired under the shah 's regime , which ended in 1979 , @entity104 said , as well as @entity204 - made mig - 29s			1
on paper , they are not a match for the @entity8 planes			1
" @entity8 remains the pre-eminent air force in the region -- well - equipped , and they have trained long and hard , " he said			1
" the @entity1 are at an obvious disadvantage in terms of the age and quality of the equipment they have , but they also train hard and will be motivated , " @entity104 said			1
" i would be surprised if the @entity8 are underestimating the @entity1			1

an @entity8 attack on @entity1 would involve more than 100 planes , experts say
they would need to hit as many as eight well - protected @entity1 targets
experts : @entity8 's air force is *superior* on paper , but the @entity1 train hard
@entity8 has vowed not to let @entity1 get nuclear weapons
