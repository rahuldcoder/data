there are few issues that preoccupy new parents more than this : is my baby growing normally ? when the percentiles seem off - kilter , we worry -- but experts say there 's rarely reason for concern			1
a growth chart can be used to monitor where a child 's height and weight falls in relation to national averages			1
for starters , healthy kids come in a wide range of shapes and sizes , and they do n't grow at a steady rate , either			1
your child can look very different from your friends ' kids -- or from his own siblings at the same age -- and still be completely normal			1
what influences growth at birth : a baby 's size when he 's born is based partly on genetics			2
firstborns tend to be smaller than subsequent children because the uterus is smaller and tighter in first - time moms			1
boys are larger than girls , and multiples , boys and girls , are smaller than average			1
some environmental factors that can influence a newborn 's size : the mother 's weight -- very heavy women tend to have larger babies weight gain during pregnancy -- a very low gain ( under ten pounds ) usually means a smaller baby whether or not @entity60 smokes or drinks a lot of caffeine -- both of which can limit an unborn baby 's growth a mom 's chronic illness -- diabetics , for instance , often have very large babies			1
during the first two years : a baby 's growth is based on a combination of her birth size and the size she 's genetically programmed to be : a small newborn who 's going to be a big child will grow faster in the first two years than a big baby who 's going to be a small child			1
parenting.com : baby milestones @entity82 's son , @entity81 , was 23 inches long when he was born -- the average newborn is just 20 inches -- and his pediatrician joked that he might be seven feet tall as an adult			2
" but based on my height and my husband 's , the doctor did n't think that would happen , " says the @entity87 mom			0
sure enough , by the time @entity81 was 3 , his growth had slowed and his height was just average for his age			1
parenting.com : toddler milestones during childhood : both weight gain and increases in height come in short bursts of what can seem like rapid growth -- which is why kids can sometimes look almost chubby one month but lean the next			2
the duration of a growth spurt , as well as how much a child grows during one , differs from child to child ( and from spurt to spurt in the same child )			1
but it 's not uncommon to see a visible difference in a very short time : at age 10 , my son @entity115 once outgrew a pair of dress pants in less than a week			0
no one knows what causes a kid to shoot up one month and not another , but there does seem to be a seasonal pattern			0
" although we do n't have a good explanation for it , children seem to grow fastest in the summer and slowest in the fall , " says @entity125 , @entity126 , associate professor of pediatrics at @entity128 in @entity87			1
doctors do know what triggers growth in the first place : it 's the human growth hormone , a chemical produced in bursts throughout the day but released largely during sleep			2
that 's why it 's important for kids to get the shut - eye they need throughout childhood and adolescence			2
during puberty : after infancy , the tween and teen years are the period of most rapid change			0
for girls , the growth spurt begins between 10 and 11 and lasts until around 15 ; for boys , it starts about two years later and lasts until age 17 or so			2
girls typically stop growing about three years after they 've had their first period , but boys continue to grow throughout their teens			2
parenting.com : ages , stages hot spots ways to keep track until 2002 , the growth chart -- the tool doctors use to make sure kids are growing normally -- was based exclusively on norms for bottle - fed @entity171 children			1
since breastfed babies tend to be smaller , as do @entity175 and @entity177 - @entity176 babies , the chart now includes averages for all ethnic groups , as well as for breastfed infants			1
in addition , the new charts track body mass index , which helps pediatricians know when a child is at risk of obesity			2
parenting.com : guide to childhood obesity most growth disorders are diagnosed by pediatricians , not parents , but sometimes a child who is n't growing normally can slip through the cracks			1
according to a study in the @entity198 , about 70 percent of all kids are measured inaccurately at their checkups			0
( measurements tend to be off by about half an inch			0
) so watch carefully as your child is being measured			0
and feel free to pitch in , if needed , to hold a wiggly baby still , which will help make sure the measurement is accurate			0
double - check to see if the nurse records this information on the correct chart for your child 's age and sex , too			1
my son @entity115 was once briefly in the 110th percentile for height ; then the nurse realized she 'd charted him on the curve for girls , not boys			0
parenting.com : height calculator by comparing your child 's current place on the chart with earlier recordings , your doctor will be able to see if he 's growing normally			1
signs that something may be amiss : his height seems off , given the height of his parents or siblings			0
he 's nowhere near the averages he drops 20 percentile points or more from one year to the next			0
he 's gaining weight much more rapidly than he 's gaining height			0
puberty comes very early or very late			0
in such cases , your doctor may suggest a specialist			0
most of the time , though , you just need to wait for the next growth spurt			0
and then you , like me , may find yourself buying your child another new pair of dress - up pants			1
