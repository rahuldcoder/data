@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 , look out			0
your traditional video game console business model may be in danger			1
@entity10 video games like the " @entity12 " series may soon be available on a new system			2
it 's too early to tell how much danger , of course , but a start - up called @entity18 announced a brand - new game distribution system monday night that , if it works as planned , could change the games game forever			1
@entity18 , which was started by @entity22 founder @entity21 and former @entity24 ceo @entity23 , is aiming to launch a system -- seven years in the works -- that will digitally distribute first - run , @entity30 games from publishers like @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , and others , all at the same time as those titles are released into retail channels			1
the system is designed to allow players to stream on - demand games at the highest quality onto any @entity45 - based @entity44 or pc running xp or @entity48 , regardless of how powerful the computer			2
the system will also stream games directly to a tv via a small plug - in device , and players can use a custom wireless controller as well as @entity57 headsets in conjunction with it			2
based here in @entity0 , @entity18 timed its formal unveiling to this week 's @entity62 , where it will be showcasing the technology and 16 initial games it will launch with			1
the service is currently in a closed beta , but is expected to go into a public beta this summer , and to launch this winter			1
according to @entity21 , @entity18 's technology will make it possible to stream the games in such a manner -- high quality , no matter what kind of system the user has -- by virtue of a series of patented and patent - pending compression technologies			1
and instead of requiring users to download the games , @entity18 will host them all and stream them from a series of the highest - end servers			1
users will have only to download a 1mb plug - in to get the service up and running			2
@entity18 is hoping to capture a significant portion of the video game market share			1
in february , the industry posted one of its strongest months ever , with total sales of $ 1.47 billion , up 10 percent from a year ago			0
and in february , the @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 accounted for total sales of 1.42 million units			0
an intended benefit of this infrastructure , @entity21 and @entity23 explained , is that users will be able to play streamed games via @entity18 with no lag , so long as their internet connections meet minimum thresholds			1
for standard - definition play , that would mean a minimum 1.5 mbps connection , and for high - def , 5 mbps			0
that 's obviously an essential feature , as it 's hard to imagine anyone paying for a service like @entity18 , no matter what games are on offer , if the user experience is inadequate			1
but the company promises that as long as users have the requisite minimum hardware , operating systems , and internet connections , they should be able to have seamless play			0
the upshot of this infrastructure model , @entity21 said , is that @entity18 is somewhat future - proof , meaning that players wo n't have to upgrade anything to keep on playing games on the system years into the future			1
instead , the upgrades will happen on the back - end , with the company regularly boosting the power of the servers it uses to host and stream the games			2
and while demos always have to be taken with a grain of salt , @entity2 did see a real - time presentation of @entity18 on at least two different computers and on a hd tv			1
game play was as smooth and lag - free as advertised so far , @entity18 has yet to make its business model public , but what seems likely is some form of subscription service , where players will pay a monthly access fee and then pay additional costs , depending on whether they want to play games once , or buy them for permanent play			1
the company also said that it will probably offer free trials of some or all of the games it offers , allowing consumers to decide whether they want to buy			0
@entity18 recognizes that some players may use those trials as a way of deciding whether to buy such games from traditional retail stores , but @entity21 and @entity23 suggested that as long as people are interacting with the @entity18 system , they 'll be happy			1
it 's clear that @entity18 is modeling its system at least somewhat after @entity4 's hit @entity167 service			1
so fans of multiplayer games wo n't be on their own			0
rather , they 'll have full access to multiplayer features of games built for them			0
and another interesting social feature is one that will allow users to digitally watch others play games in real time			2
the company thinks that users will find it exciting to watch the best players in action , even if they themselves are only kibitzing			0
@entity21 said that the concept of spectating in online game systems is , in and of itself , not new , but that @entity18 presents the first time players will be able to look in on what others are playing without owning the games themselves			1
another social feature in the @entity167 mold is what are called " brag clips			0
" these are essentially 15 - second replays of game action that players can share with friends if they want to show off their prowess			0
this is possible , @entity21 said , because @entity18 is continually recording the last 15 seconds of action			0
all told , @entity23 said , @entity18 offers a full suite of standard social features including friends , clans , rankings , leader boards , tournaments and more			0
from the outset , @entity18 is n't partnering with any of the first - party publishers -- @entity4 , @entity3 , and @entity5 , meaning that franchises like " @entity210 " or " @entity211 " wo n't be available			1
and that makes sense , since those companies are hardly likely to want to sign up with a company whose very technology may obviate their longstanding business models			0
that means , @entity21 and @entity23 acknowledged , that many players who sign up for @entity18 's service will still maintain their consoles , and continue to buy games for them			1
at least for the rest of the current generation of machines , they said			0
but come the next generation , all bets are off , they said			0
and for the nine -- to date -- third - party publishers who have committed to being involved , @entity23 said , @entity18 presents a much more efficient and profitable distribution model than the standard retail structure			1
that 's because the system is all digital , cutting down on physical distribution costs , and because it is designed to eradicate piracy and second - hand sales , both of which are banes of the publishers ' existence			1
indeed , @entity23 said that @entity18 has gotten strong commitments of titles from the nine publishers			2
that means , added @entity21 , that the planned launch this winter could be accompanied by the most titles of any new gaming system launch in history			2
in addition , @entity23 said publishers are eager for the kind of raw data that @entity18 can provide about players ' usage of the games , including whether they like or dislike games , how much they play , how they play and so on			2
that data is hard for publishers to collect with traditional consoles , he argued			0
clearly , @entity18 has set an ambitious goal : dethroning the console makers as the game industry 's kings			2
and as is always the case with brand - new and publicly unavailable technology , it is far too early to know whether the company or the service can live up to that goal			0
but if its demo is any indication , @entity18 is definitely onto something , and given that the company has been in stealth mode for so many years , it 's possible that the console makers will be caught off guard			0
