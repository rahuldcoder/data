@entity0 -- a judge 's claim that she was ordered to always rule in the @entity7 's favor in cases against civilian mariners can not be substantiated , the @entity3 inspector general concluded tuesday			1
the inspector general also concluded that the judge 's two - year delay in coming forward with the allegation casts doubt on her veracity			1
inspector general @entity16 's 53 - page report is a nearly complete victory for the @entity7 's administrative law judge program , which hears cases brought against merchant mariners , and a repudiation of retired administrative law judge @entity22 , who claimed the system was rigged in the @entity7 's favor			1
@entity22 , a judge from july 2004 until march 2007 , said in a court affidavit and later testified before @entity26 that chief administrative law judge @entity27 specifically told her in 2005 that she should always rule for the @entity7			1
@entity22 also said comments by fellow judges buttressed her belief that the @entity7 should prevail on all cases			2
" i was specifically told that i should always rule for the @entity7 and that it i ever found myself faced with a circumstance when i just absolutely , positively could not find anyway to rule in favor of the @entity7 on any issue , that i should rule against them , but word it delicately and just apologize for it as much as i could , " she said			1
but the @entity3 inspector @entity42 concluded tuesday that , " there is no evidence supporting ... @entity22 's claim except her own statement			2
" @entity22 's brief employment at the @entity7 " was rife with conflict " and there was a " growing distrust " between her and colleagues , the report says			2
" these factors likely contributed to ... @entity22 's belief that ( her boss ) and others were engaging in misconduct and pressuring her to rule against mariners , " it says			0
@entity22 's allegations roiled the administrative law judge 's office of the @entity7 and sparked an investigation by the @entity67 into the @entity7 's judicial system			1
the newspaper reported that mariners prevailed only 14 times out of about 6,300 charges brought over eight years			0
most of the cases were settled or resulted in guilty pleas without reaching a courtroom , and some were dismissed , but overall @entity7 prosecutors had a 97 percent success rate , the @entity67 reported			0
the @entity16 report , parts of which are redacted , apparently does not address the numerical findings of the @entity67 @entity22 said it was at an april 8 , 2005 , meeting that @entity27 told her to always rule in favor of the @entity7			1
@entity27 dismissed all but one colleague from the room before making the remark , she said			0
@entity22 cited several other reasons she believed she was to have a @entity95 bias			0
in one instance , she said , a fellow judge commented about one of his cases , saying , " if i ruled that way , the chief judge would have my job			0
" in yet another instance , @entity22 alleged , @entity27 and others engaged in improper conversations about pending cases			0
but the inspector general 's office said it could not substantiate any of @entity22 's allegations			1
both @entity27 and the senior staff member present at the 2005 meeting said @entity27 " did not say anything that could reasonably be construed as directing @entity115 to rule in favor of the @entity7 , " the inspector general 's report said			1
" instead , they assert that ( @entity118 ) only instructed her to follow @entity7 's regulations			2
" the staffer called @entity22 's allegation " a flat lie			0
" @entity22 first made her allegation two months after she retired in an affidavit in support of a mariner in a $ 15 million lawsuit against @entity7 employees			0
" the timing and manner in which @entity22 made her allegations also undermine the gravity of the allegations , " the report says .			0

a judge claimed she was told to always rule for the @entity7 in cases
she served in the @entity7 's administrative law judge program
an inspector general 's report found her claim can not be substantiated
