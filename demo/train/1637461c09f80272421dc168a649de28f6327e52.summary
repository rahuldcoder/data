@entity0 , @entity1 -- last week @entity3 released a letter calling on @entity5 to take down the names of civilians identified as having collaborated with the @entity8 and with @entity10 forces			1
in our view making the names of @entity14 civilians public could put them at risk of reprisals from the @entity18 or other insurgent forces in @entity14			1
some news reports and some pundits portrayed our statement as an unequivocal condemnation of @entity5 , but this is not the case			2
@entity3 supports the continued existence and work of @entity5 , and we are ready to take part in any discussion about the problems inherent in managing and disclosing vast amounts of critical information			1
but we also believe that to continue their work , @entity5 and other websites likely to publish documents from whistle - blowers need to ensure that the information disclosed does not pose an avoidable threat to the security of civilians			1
pointing that out does not amount to , for example , support for the @entity45 's request that @entity5 remove all documents from its website or a call for outright censorship			1
in fact , @entity5 has published useful information , and we hope it can continue to serve journalists and the wider public			2
we have spoken out strongly against the @entity45 's request that @entity5 remove all documents from its website and against the detention of the alleged source of the leaks , @entity59			1
we 've also criticized proposed amendments to the federal shield law that would exclude whistle - blowing sites such as @entity5 from any legal protection of sources			1
we are not disputing the importance of the @entity67			0
indeed , it is more important than ever that there be an outlet for information governments want to keep secret			0
too often , government departments and agencies resort without justification to declaring documents classified or secret to conceal information that is of public interest			0
exaggerated and at times unsubstantiated safety concerns have been used to block important information from being made public in the past			0
the @entity45 , the @entity83 and @entity84 administrations are no strangers to these tactics			0
whistle - blowing sites deserve , and have , our support			1
however , the case of the war logs illustrates the difficulties that will arise when dealing with the sheer mass of information that may become available			0
even the largest news organizations in the world would be overwhelmed , and -- for the moment at least -- @entity5 does not command resources of that scope			2
@entity99 , the @entity5 editor - in - chief , has said that by reviewing the document classification system and certain parts of the material , his organization was able to identify and withhold 15,000 documents that possibly contain the names of innocent informers , and that is commendable			1
it does not change the fact that releasing so many documents without being able go through the large majority of them is problematic			0
whistle - blowing websites need to deal with this issue if they want to avoid giving the authorities an excuse to muzzle them			1
we should note though , that through the good offices of the @entity121 , @entity5 requested the help of the @entity84 @entity123 in vetting the material , a request the @entity123 denied			2
it is not beyond imagining that rather than cooperate in an attempt to protect its informers and collaborators , the @entity127 government chose instead to keep all its tactical options open in its campaign against @entity5			2
indeed , adm. @entity135 , chairman of the @entity136 , was quick to say @entity5 would have blood on its hands , although he brought no evidence of that			0
@entity5 staff is under considerable pressure from @entity144 governments , and alleged surveillance and rumors of extraditions have exacerbated a climate of apprehension within its day - to - day operations			2
it can not be easy working under such conditions			0
but if the media is to demand a high level of transparency in public affairs , they must also demonstrate a high level of responsibility			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0
