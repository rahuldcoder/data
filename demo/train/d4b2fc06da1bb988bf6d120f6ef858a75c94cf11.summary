-- capt. @entity1 still has trouble sleeping			1
the night after executing a spectacular belly landing in @entity5 , the veteran pilot tossed and turned until 4 a.m. the phone kept ringing , he told @entity5 media , and he kept reliving the chilling moments when his crew and passengers came close to a disaster			1
now basking in his nation 's adoration and fielding countless interview requests , @entity1 is resting even less , he said with a weary smile			1
@entity1 , who has worked for @entity17 for 20 years , was at the controls of a @entity19 767 en route from @entity20 , @entity21 , to @entity22 on tuesday when he realized there was a problem with the landing gear			1
when the second attempt to open it failed , he knew that everyone on board -- 220 passengers and 11 crew -- was in danger			0
" i 've maybe flown this plane 500 times , and the landing gear deployed every time , " @entity1 said during a news conference in @entity22 on wednesday			1
" i never had any trouble flying @entity19			2
" aware of comparisons to the 2009 " @entity39 , " when capt. @entity40 landed a plane in @entity43 's @entity42 after a flock of geese damaged both of the aircraft 's engines , @entity1 pointed out that his situation was less dire			1
both of his engines were working fine and there was time to prepare			0
after notifying @entity22 's airport that there might be an emergency landing , the crew had time to perform checks and various functions , @entity1 said			1
they circled the city to burn off excess fuel			0
while the crew reviewed the procedure in the cockpit , the flight attendants prepared the cabin , instructing passengers that they would have to evacuate as soon as the plane stopped on the ground			2
the autopilot helped the crew guide the plane until about two minutes before landing , @entity1 said			1
that 's when he took manual control			0
" we rested the plane on three points : two engines plus the rear portion of the fuselage , " @entity1 said			2
" we tried to do it delicately , and we were successful			0
" there was less noise during the belly landing than a normal touch down , which shocked @entity1			1
it was just quiet , he recalled			0
@entity1 , who has been dubbed the @entity5 version of @entity40 , was praised by the original " miracle " pilot			1
" the captain and the crew obviously did a great job , " @entity40 told @entity0			0
" it definitely requires skill to do this well , and from all reports and from watching the video , it looked like it was done very , very well			0
" but for @entity1 , there were still tense moments ahead			2
" when the plane stopped on the runway , i was n't sure whether everyone was safe , because smoke appeared , " he recalled			0
( @entity105 had blown the smoke caused by the friction of the landing toward the cockpit			0
) " i finally felt full relief only when the purser reported that the cabin was empty			1
" everyone got out safe and unhurt			0
like @entity40 , @entity1 is now grappling with sudden fame and the gratitude of hundreds of families			2
he 's a @entity117 star , with several fan pages established in his honor			0
one page has more than 33,000 followers leaving messages of praise and adulation			0
but @entity1 insists it 's too much to call him a national hero			1
" i am convinced that all of us who work for @entity17 would do the exact same thing , and it would end in the same way , because we train for such situations on simulators , " he said			2
@entity1 is fully prepared to return to his duties as pilot , he said			1
in fact , his schedule -- prepared before the incident -- has him flying to @entity139 , @entity140 , on saturday			0
he 's not sure whether the commission investigating the emergency landing will let him go			2
@entity1 's wife and two adult children beamed when they were interviewed by @entity5 media on thursday			1
@entity146 found out about her husband 's troubled flight on television while the plane was still circling @entity22 and raced to the airport to watch the emergency landing , she told the program @entity154			2
but she had to turn back when authorities closed off many streets leading to the airport as a safety precaution			0
when she got back home , the plane had already landed			0
" i knew the landing would be successful because i could n't imagine otherwise , " @entity1 's wife said .			1
