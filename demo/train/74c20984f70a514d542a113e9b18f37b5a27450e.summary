-- in the past week , there has been a spate of news stories about the level of @entity6 's involvement in @entity7 in the years when he ran the organizing committee for the @entity9			1
what is this controversy all about ? @entity6 contends that he ceased actively managing @entity7 in february 1999 when he joined the @entity13 organization			1
as a candidate for president , he filed a @entity16 with the @entity17 stating that " mr. @entity6 retired from @entity7 on february 11 , 1999 , to head the @entity18			1
since february 11 , 1999 , mr. @entity6 has not had any active role with any @entity7 entity and has not been involved in the operations of any @entity7 entity in any way			1
" as we learned last week , documents filed with the @entity25 contradict this statement			1
some of these documents were @entity29 reports , required to be filed pursuant to the @entity30 whenever any person or group acquires 5 % or more of the stock of any public company			0
the purpose of such reports is to notify the securities markets of a possible change in control of a public company			0
for example , a @entity29 for @entity41 , filed may 2 , 2000 , covers the acquisition of 32.7 % of the shares of @entity41 by @entity45 and related entities			0
@entity45 ( @entity47 ) was one of many investment vehicles managed by @entity7 ( @entity50 )			2
the @entity51 represents that @entity6 is chief executive officer , president and managing director of @entity47 and his principal occupation is " managing director of @entity56 " similarly , a @entity29 for @entity57 , filed november 22 , 1999 , by various @entity7 entities and @entity6 as an individual states that @entity6 is " the sole shareholder , chairman , chief executive officer and president of @entity50 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 " elsewhere in this document , @entity6 is described as " sole stockholder , sole director , chief executive officer , managing director , chairman and president of @entity50			1
" a proxy statement for 2000 filed by @entity57 several months later indicates that the @entity7 entities , together with @entity6 , owned more than 11 % of the shares of @entity57 and that @entity6 had the power to vote and dispose of these shares			1
at the next annual meeting , a @entity7 representative was nominated to the @entity57 board			2
the contradictory representations in the @entity17 and @entity25 filings are at best evasive and at worst a violation of federal law			2
a federal statute -- 18 u.s.c. ยง 1001 -- provides that anyone who " in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive , legislative , or judicial branch of the @entity91 , knowingly and willfully -- ( 1 ) falsifies , conceals , or covers up by any trick , scheme , or device a material fact ; ( 2 ) makes any materially false , fictitious , or fraudulent statement or representation " shall be fined or imprisoned			0
violations of federal securities laws , including the making of false statements in a @entity29 filing , are independently punishable under the securities laws			0
although prosecutions for false statements in 13d filings are not common , @entity107 , the junk bond king , was prosecuted by @entity108 , and went to jail for aiding and abetting a false @entity29 filing by @entity111			0
( this was a plea bargain in a complex and controversial case , involving charges of numerous securities law violations			0
) @entity6 is not now claiming his 13d filings were inaccurate or false , but he is claiming that although he was chief executive officer , managing director , chairman and president of @entity7 , he was not really there , but in @entity120 managing the @entity13			1
nevertheless , he was earning more than $ 100,000 in salary from @entity7			1
since he will not release his income tax returns for 1999 - 2002 , we have no idea how high this salary really was			2
if @entity6 was not " involved " in the operations of @entity7 , why was he being paid ? as sole shareholder , why did he keep himself on as ceo ? also , at least with respect to the @entity57 deal , he invested as an individual along with the @entity7 entities			1
why is @entity6 's story about his relationship to @entity7 and its investment activities at odds with the documents his firm filed ? @entity7 is a private equity firm			1
it acts principally by forming investment partnerships such as @entity45 to buy and sell operating companies			0
when @entity141 was headed by @entity6 , it invested in numerous distressed companies and attempted to turn them around and then sell them at a profit			2
these deals were financed by highly leveraged junk bonds			0
excessive leverage by investment banks and others led to the 2008 financial meltdown from which we have yet to recover , but many investors reaped large profits from these leveraged deals			0
also , partners in private equity companies such as @entity7 were taxed at advantageous rates called " carried interest			2
" we do not know how much money @entity6 made on @entity7 deals because he will not make full disclosure of his finances			1
some portfolio companies were resold by @entity7 entities at a substantial profit ; others failed			2
that is the nature of private equity investment			0
some of these companies were engaged in businesses or business practices that @entity6 now finds politically inconvenient , so he is attempting to absolve himself of responsibility for these deals			1
but the ceo , sole director and sole shareholder of an entity is legally responsible , and should be held accountable , for any wrongdoing or questionable activities of the company he heads			0
if @entity6 wants the @entity182 public to judge him by his business successes , we also need to judge him by his business failures and see the entire record of his financial dealings			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity6 says he ceased managing @entity7 when he took over @entity13 in 1999
@entity189 says @entity6 *signed* @entity25 documents saying he was @entity7 ceo after 1999
she asks why did he continue in that role and why did he get a salary if he had left the job ?
failure to *reveal* finances means we do *n't* know how much he made on @entity7 deals , she says
