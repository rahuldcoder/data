@entity0 was the sort of radicalized individual who makes @entity5 counterterrorism officials very apprehensive : someone who was determined , trained , living legally in @entity7 or the @entity8 and operating alone			1
one of dozens ( perhaps hundreds ) of militants either unknown to authorities or suspected of plotting a terrorist attack but whose real intentions and movements are difficult to track			2
@entity0 was shot dead at the end of a lengthy siege on thursday ; he had been hunted by police in connection with the killings of seven people in the past 10 days			0
he had twice visited the @entity25 - @entity24 border area , in 2010 and 2011 , @entity22 officials said wednesday			1
and after the standoff began in @entity27 , he claimed to have been trained by @entity28 , they say			2
suspect holds police at bay @entity33 prosecutor @entity32 said wednesday , " he has traveled to @entity25 without using the networks known by @entity22 and foreign intelligence services , which means he went there by his own means and without going through facilitators known by intelligences services , and without going through countries usually monitored			1
" but @entity0 had appeared on the security services ' radar , according to @entity32			0
during his first trip to @entity25 , " @entity25 police checked his id during a traffic stop , and as a result he was handed over to the @entity48 , who then put him on board the first plane heading to @entity22 , " @entity32 said			1
( a senior @entity8 official gave a different account , saying @entity25 forces had actually handed him over to @entity22 troops , who had him repatriated			1
) @entity0 had been under surveillance by @entity22 intelligence for years , according to interior minister @entity60			1
even so , he was apparently able to visit the @entity25 - @entity24 region a second time and then accumulate weapons after returning home , including an uzi machine pistol and an assault rifle , plan a series of attacks in @entity27 and @entity69 , and force the @entity22 government to step up security precautions nationwide			1
the jihadist trail @entity22 authorities believe that between 20 and 30 @entity22 nationals are tied to jihadist groups in the @entity25 - @entity24 border area			1
however , one @entity22 intelligence estimate in 2010 put the potential number as high as 200 or 250			1
in 2008 , a group of militants traveled from @entity22 to @entity24 's tribal areas , where they joined @entity28 , including @entity82 , a @entity22 citizen of @entity84 descent			1
@entity82 was killed in fighting in the border region			0
who is @entity0 ? in fall 2010 , another militant returning from the region and suspected of meeting with @entity28 operatives was arrested on suspicion of plotting a terrorist attack in @entity22			1
@entity22 's growing @entity24 diaspora has added to concerns about travel flows to @entity24			2
@entity22 intelligence services have invested heavily in keeping tabs on nationals who have made the trip recently			1
in april 2011 , two @entity22 nationals were arrested in @entity100 , @entity24 , after meeting with @entity101 , an @entity102 @entity28 - linked operative			1
the two -- one of whom was of @entity24 descent , and one of whom was a convert to @entity109 -- met @entity101 so he could transport them for training in @entity111 , according to @entity24 intelligence officials			0
radicalization in @entity7 what is unclear is when and how @entity0 was radicalized , whether online or through membership of a radical @entity117 group in @entity7			0
@entity60 said wednesday that @entity0 became radicalized amid a small salafist group in @entity27 and had connections to a group called @entity121 ( " @entity122 " )			0
but there is no evidence that any of its members was involved in or aware of his plans			0
@entity121 was outlawed in january by the @entity22 government , which alleged that it was a terrorist organization training members " for armed combat			1
" for its part , the group said its mission was to fight @entity134 and has said it will contest the government 's decision			0
but its website used militant language such as calling for " soldiers " to defend @entity141 women			0
and while there is no evidence that @entity121 has been involved in acts of violence , it has certainly promoted the threatening rhetoric of others , glorifying @entity150 - @entity8 cleric @entity149 , who was killed last year			0
one member suggested that the right - wing @entity153 politician @entity152 deserved a " bullet in the forehead			0
" @entity152 has campaigned against permitting minarets on mosques in @entity153			0
@entity121 also seems to be tied to a group called the @entity160 sur internet , which campaigns to have islamophobic material removed from websites			0
@entity121 appears to have been strongest in @entity33 and the central @entity22 city of @entity164 , where several of its members were arrested in 2010 after invading a @entity168 's restaurant and shouting anti-semitic slogans			2
the group has also protested a @entity22 law banning women from wearing a full veil in public places and posted a number of well - produced videos of its protests in @entity22 cities			2
its outlook appears very similar to other radical @entity117 groups in @entity7 , such as @entity182 in @entity183 and @entity184 , as well as @entity141 in the @entity8			0
videos purportedly produced jointly by @entity184 and @entity121 have been uploaded to @entity186 in the past month			0
@entity109 radicalization increased in @entity22 in the 2000s , fueled by growing militancy in social media , the role of @entity22 troops in @entity25 , and the @entity194 issue			2
bleak socioeconomic prospects in the suburbs of @entity22 cities where many @entity22 @entity195 of @entity197 descent live , the rise of the far right in @entity22 and the government 's ban on the niqab ( full veil ) has added to the sense of grievance felt by some young @entity22 muslims			2
unlike in the @entity8 or @entity183 , @entity22 laws restricted the ability of @entity22 radical groups to freely proselytize , but according to some analysts , the lack of a public pressure valve may have itself been dangerous			1
before his death , @entity215 tried to tap into the grievances of @entity195 living in @entity22			1
in an october 2010 audio recording attributed to @entity215 , he attacked the @entity22 ban on the niqab			2
" the equation is very clear and simple : as you kill , you will be killed ; as you take others hostages , you will be taken hostages ; as you waste our security , we will ... waste your security , " @entity215 said			0
that message , and similar audio and video postings from the likes of @entity149 , resonate with a fringe of marginalized young @entity141 men living in the poorer quartiers of @entity22 cities , with little prospect of work and regular confrontations with police			1
according to @entity22 officials , @entity0 had a series of convictions for petty crime and had been turned down for army service			1
@entity28 changing gears @entity28 propaganda and recruitment efforts have shifted emphasis in recent years , from spectacular attacks on the scale of 9/11 to " do - it - yourself " attacks that require less training and planning			0
in june 2011 , the group 's media production arm as @entity256 released a video titled " @entity258 , " encouraging followers to carry out acts of individual terrorism in the @entity262			2
in the recording , @entity264 - born @entity28 spokesman @entity263 said it was easy for @entity8 @entity28 sympathizers to go to a gun show and purchase an automatic assault rifle without having to submit to a background check			0
@entity28 's @entity150 branch has been especially vocal in encouraging lone acts of terrorism			0
its @entity274 - language magazine @entity273 has a section dedicated to helping terrorist sympathizers in the @entity262 carry out attacks , including bomb - making recipes			1
according to authorities , one such formula , " how to make a bomb in @entity284 , " has been downloaded by individuals plotting terrorist attacks in both the @entity8 and the @entity183 .			0

@entity22 shooting suspect was type of person who worries counterterror officials
he was determined , trained , living legally in the @entity262 and operating alone
@entity22 officials believe many @entity22 nationals are tied to terrorist groups
