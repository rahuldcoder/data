-- lawyers for @entity2 , the @entity3 man charged with murder in the death of teenager @entity6 , said monday that they are appealing a judge 's decision not to step aside in the controversial case			1
in a one - sentence order issued august 1 , @entity11 circuit judge @entity10 said that defense lawyers ' july request that he recuse himself was " legally insufficient			1
" the same team announced monday on a website they 've set up that they 'd since filed a petition for writ of prohibition asking @entity3 's fifth district appeals court to try to remove @entity10 from the case			0
the office of lawyer @entity24 later confirmed to @entity0 that the appeal was filed monday			0
" right now , of course , he is still the trial judge on the case , ( and ) we 're still moving forward with whatever we have to do or need to do , " @entity24 said of @entity10 on monday , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity26			0
" but the appellate court will handle what 's called this extraordinary writ as quickly as they can			0
" judge in @entity2 case says he wo n't step aside on april 20 , weeks after the february 26 shooting and nine days after charges were issued , @entity10 set a $ 150,000 bond for @entity2			1
but the judge revoked that bond in june , after learning that @entity2 and his wife , @entity40 , had misrepresented their financial situation during a court hearing , including failing to disclose more than $ 150,000 in donations from the public			1
in his order last month , @entity10 said that the new $ 1 million bail order was not a punishment but an amount that assured the court that @entity2 would not abscond			0
in his ruling , @entity10 wrote about the first bond hearing and noted an undisclosed second passport kept in @entity2 's safe deposit box			1
" notably , together with the passport , the money only had to be hidden for a short time for him to leave the country if the defendant made a quick decision to flee , " the judge said			0
" it is entirely reasonable for this court to find that , but for the requirement that he be placed on electronic monitoring , the defendant and his wife would have fled the @entity68 with at least $ 130,000 of other people 's money			0
" @entity10 wrote that the defendant 's plans to flee were " thwarted			0
" days later , the defense team filed a motion in circuit court saying @entity2 can not get a fair trial because @entity10 used " gratuitous , disparaging " language in his second bail order			1
@entity3 prosecutors mistakenly release confidential @entity2 case documents " mr. @entity2 has lost faith in the objectivity of this court and has a reasonable , well - founded fear that he will not receive a fair trial by this court , " his lawyers said in the document			2
@entity2 's attorneys particularly took issue with two of the judge 's comments : " under any definition , the defendant has flouted the system , " citing the definition of flout , and " the defendant has tried to manipulate the system when he has been presented the opportunity to do so			2
" the 28 - year - old @entity2 is free after posting the more recent $ 1 million bond			2
he 's charged with second - degree murder in the death of @entity6 , an unarmed 17 - year - old black teen who was shot and killed while walking through @entity105 , @entity3 , neighborhood			1
@entity2 says he shot @entity6 in self - defense during a struggle , but prosecutors say he ignored a 911 dispatcher 's advice not to follow the teen			1
@entity2 's wife pleads not guilty on perjury charge @entity0 's @entity114 contributed to this report .			2
