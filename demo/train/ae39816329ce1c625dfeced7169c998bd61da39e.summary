-- after back - to - back stomach clutching renditions of " not gon ' cry " and " i 'm going down " at the @entity4 in @entity5 sunday night , @entity6 pulled off an @entity8 - worthy seminar on affirmation with " @entity10 " to close out the three - day fest , which celebrates black music and african - american culture			1
the synth - heavy number pierced to the core of the capacity @entity18 crowd			2
as @entity6 danced around in a shimmering black mini-dress , the audience took over the number and launched into a sing - along that reached up to the fifth level of the arena			1
earlier , @entity6 told @entity0 , " i do n't think fans come here to hear you talk about your new album			2
they come to hold their stomachs when you sing that song that you love so much			2
that 's what [ the festival ] is about			2
you got ta give the people what they want			0
photos : 2011 @entity4 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity6 , @entity40 and more if @entity6 's set was packaged as faith and forgiveness , then saturday night 's headliner , @entity38 , was essentially id decked out in a sporty white blazer			1
the @entity46 arrived through the air via a cable - enabled lift before he got off and had a @entity51 - inspired moment and walked through the crowd to reach the stage for " power			1
" riffing off recent performances , @entity38 's show was a mix of his @entity59 set ( in three acts ) and his vma performance ( red suit ) but with a nod to the @entity4 crowd , as he finished with a stirring musical testimony to his mother , " @entity67			1
" photos : the @entity69 performances from @entity59 2011 " it feels so good to be back home , " ' @entity38 told the audience -- not unlike @entity6 , preaching the power of healing			1
" when i say home , i mean my people			0
i been around the world			0
i got into a little trouble			0
a little controversy here and there			0
but before i go any further in the show , i wan na thank you for coming out and still supporting me			0
" friday night headliner @entity39 and @entity86 ( friday 's penultimate performer ) had an unofficial generational game of one - upmanship			1
@entity86 commandeered the stage for what felt like an eternity , though in actuality it was much closer to two hours , still , surely more than his allotment			0
the former @entity96 singer ran through a series of his old cohort 's hits , from " @entity101 " to " @entity100			0
" @entity102 , as he 's been dubbed by @entity103 , cut into @entity39 's constituency when he launched into " @entity105			1
" the song not only shares the title with one of @entity39 's tracks , but the swooping song is best known ( at least to the younger set ) as @entity86 's dedication to @entity103 and his wife when the couple renewed their vows			1
@entity86 smiled , preened and pranced as the audience swayed from side to side			0
a rejuvenated @entity39 , however , proved it 's still a younger man 's game			2
he also arrived from the sky like @entity38 , but once he landed ( equipped with a helmet ) , the pre-july 4th fireworks started			1
" @entity126 " and " @entity127 " thundered throughout the dome			0
shrieks echoed as leather - clad @entity130 slithered between dancers during " @entity132 " and " @entity133			2
" but , much like @entity6 noted , the crowd wanted nostalgia and @entity39 offered it in heaps with a three - song @entity138 medley			1
it was a true " @entity141 " moment			0
