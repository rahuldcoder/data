@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are over 15,000 @entity4 in the world but none like the one at 328 15th @entity7 in @entity0			1
officially the coffee shop is called " 15th @entity12 " but the store and a similar sister location have earned another name : " the @entity4			1
" at first glance the coffee shops in the mega-chain 's hometown of @entity0 do not even look like @entity4			1
the ubiquitous smiling mermaid logo has apparently swum away , there are no baristas in trademark green smocks either and not a tall , grande or venti sized beverage in sight			1
the only hint that the store is owned by the coffee giant and not a local java seller is the " inspired by @entity4 " lettering across the front door inside , pages from @entity34 's dialogues decorate an entire wall , sweeteners sit on a bathtub converted into a table , beer and wine are for sale and employees dole out customized drip coffees along with advice on which are the best beans			1
at every turn , the message seems to be here " it 's about the coffee			0
" after first checking that her @entity4 rewards card would actually work at the location , customer @entity50 said she liked the store precisely because it did n't seem like -- well -- such a @entity4			2
" i really liked the ambience , its not as loud as most of your @entity4			2
it just feels more @entity58 , " @entity56 said			0
" you get to the point where you walk down the street and on every corner or on every other corner there 's a @entity4			2
so i think this is a way to have a presence without it being that thumb in your face presence			0
" if customers enjoy the " stealth " @entity4 experience without linking it immediately to the coffee giant that 's fine with the creators of the concept , said @entity75 , @entity4 ' president of global development			1
" these are learning environments for us to be innovative and push the envelope , @entity4 customers worldwide have come to expect a certain amount of offerings and timing in our stores we wanted to change things up here but did n't want to disappoint any of our customers , " @entity75			1
like many retailers , 2009 was not a great year for @entity4			0
the company closed hundreds of their stores amidst the economic downturn and battled the perception that their business was based on what critics complained was overpriced coffee according to @entity75 the " stealth " stores are not a departure from the brand but an effort to get back to the basics of the successful product that launched the company from a small single location coffee shop to a worldwide phenomenon			1
" it 's rooted at the very core of @entity4 , we are an innovative company , " @entity75 said			1
" we most continue to be that , and stay relevant as we continue to move forward and grow			0
" @entity75 said @entity4 is closely watching the ideas that come out of the new stores and may eventually adopt some of those innovations company - wide			2
@entity0 - based blogger @entity112 writes about all things @entity4 on her web site @entity115 and says the new stores are an attempt by the chain to go back to " the early ' 90s where you went into the stores and @entity4 was about the coffee			1
you smelled the smell of coffee in the stores , there was n't the sound of blenders going every two seconds			0
" but small coffee shop owner @entity129 says it 's getting the small details right that 's tricky , especially for a company like @entity4 that thinks on a global scale			2
at the one location of his store @entity136 , @entity129 roasts his own coffee , chats with customers and picks out furniture that he admits resembles a mismatched living room set			0
as simple as the coffeehouse is , @entity129 says his place is genuine			0
" it 's an artificially created experience , " @entity129 says of @entity4 version of the personal coffee experience			0
" a @entity146 with a nice fa√ßade			0
i love that they want to learn but on the other hand its like how do you learn to be a @entity152 monk ? its a way of life -- you ca n't			0

not every @entity4 features a mermaid or baristas in green smocks
there are some " stealth " @entity4 shops *sprouting* up
the door of one such shop in @entity0 says it was " inspired by @entity4 "
@entity168 *executive* : stores are " learning environments for us to be innovative "
