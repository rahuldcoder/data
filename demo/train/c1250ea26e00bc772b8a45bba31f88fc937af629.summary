-- this is n't the first time critics have called @entity4 gov. @entity3 a bully			1
but now the man many consider a @entity8 presidential frontrunner is on the defensive , scrambling to distance himself from an erupting political scandal that threatens to tarnish his image well before the 2016 elections			2
e-mails that surfaced wednesday suggest top @entity3 appointees orchestrated traffic jams on the @entity16 as part of a political vendetta to punish a local mayor who would n't support him at the polls			1
lane closures around approaches to the country 's busiest bridge snarled traffic for days in september in @entity26 , @entity4 -- a problem the governor and his administration had originally blamed on a mishandled traffic study			1
in response to the e-mail firestorm , @entity3 said wednesday that he was misled by staff			1
he called the conduct outrageous and said he knew nothing about it			2
" this behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way , " he said , " and people will be held responsible for their actions			0
" even if he had nothing to do with the traffic snarls , the allegations could have serious consequences for @entity3 , analysts said			1
" there 's something about this that 's so petty and so vindictive and it feeds into this narrative that he 's a bully			1
... he 's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he does n't run a shop like that , " said @entity0 senior political analyst @entity56 , a former adviser to several @entity58 presidents			1
it 's a defining moment for @entity3 , @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity65 said			1
and how he deals with the situation in the next two days -- from whether he fires anyone to what he says -- will be key			0
" if he handles it decisively and then he sits down and calmly answers questions and does n't berate the reporters who ask them , then he has a chance to be a leader who dealt with a crisis and he moves on , " @entity65 said			1
" but if that perception starts to stick in , that 's not a presidential temperament			1
and that 's bad for him nationally in his perspective			2
it 's bad for him as he starts his new term in @entity4			1
and it 's bad for him with the audience he needs to care about most politically long - term at the moment , and that 's the @entity8 base that he wants to make him their nominee			2
" does this mean @entity3 's presidential ambitions are dashed ? " not necessarily , " @entity100 historian @entity99 wrote in an opinion piece for @entity0			1
" he 's a resourceful politician and it 's still many months before campaigning starts in earnest			1
but now his opponents have a stick to beat him with			2
best of all , it 's an anti-government stick			2
if @entity8 stand for anything right now , it 's opposing the ability of government to mess with the individual 's life -- and here we have a classic example of politicians taking revenge on each other at the expense of the average citizen			2
" political commentators from both sides of the aisle immediately recognized the potential for credibility questions , particularly around @entity3 's explanations in recent months about the traffic jams in @entity26 and previous comments rejecting suggestions of political mischief			1
" he 's already cemented a narrative as something of a bully , " said @entity132 , a @entity8 political strategist and @entity135 " host			1
" if this was happening in his administration , i do n't think it would shocking			0
" but , she said , if it " turns out he 's lying about what he knew or whether he ordered it -- that 's going to be the worst , the most damaging			2
because his authenticity is his calling card			0
" it 's important to ask how much @entity3 knew , @entity56 said , but the reality might be more complicated			1
" sometimes the boss does not order something , " @entity56 said , describing the @entity154 during the @entity155			2
" i do n't know whether @entity158 ordered @entity155 , but i can guarantee you that people who carried out @entity155 thought that 's what he would have wanted			0
there 's an environment in which you find yourself sometimes on staff when things do n't have to be said			0
" ' time for some traffic problems ' the correspondence , subpoenaed by @entity169 investigating the matter and spiced with tough @entity4 political talk and expletives , is the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the move was orchestrated because @entity26 's mayor , a @entity177 , did n't endorse @entity3 's re-election			1
mayor @entity179 said the traffic mess created serious hardships for commuters and other residents , and impacted public safety in his community			0
the exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed , causing heavy traffic backups between september 9 and 13 , two months before @entity190			0
" time for some traffic problems in @entity26 , " @entity191 , @entity3 's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs , said in an e-mail to @entity194 , then the highest - level appointee representing the state at the @entity196 and @entity4 , which operates the bridge connecting the two states			1
" got it , " @entity194 replied			0
in another message about school buses with students onboard caught in the traffic jams , @entity194 writes , " they are the children of @entity206 voters , " apparently referring to @entity206 , @entity3 's @entity169 opponent in last november 's gubernatorial election			1
those cited in the series of e-mails and text messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications			0
@entity194 , who has left his job , is expected to appear at a legislative hearing on thursday			0
read the e-mails @entity169 @entity218 deputy speaker @entity217 said the e-mails call into question the integrity of the governor 's office			2
@entity3 , he said , " has a lot of explaining to do			2
" " i do not believe the governor called the @entity196 and said , ' close some lanes			0
' but i did say i hold him responsible for the atmosphere			0
now finding that that atmosphere existed in his own office is what i find really troubling , " @entity217 said			0
@entity3 's name did not appear in the e-mails , he added			1
emergency services disrupted @entity179 told @entity0 's " @entity237 " the e-mails suggested that political motives behind the lane closures have led him to believe that @entity3 is more clued - in than he 's admitted			1
" i 'm rooting that the highest elected official in the state of @entity4 is n't involved			0
but i 'm beginning to question my judgment , " @entity179 said			0
the mayor raised the issue of public safety being compromised			0
a letter by his emergency services coordinator , @entity245 , on september 10 obtained by @entity0 cited " new traffic patterns " around the bridge 's toll plaza that were backing up traffic in @entity26			0
" this new traffic pattern is causing unnecessary delays for emergency services to arrive on scene for medical emergencies , " @entity245 said , citing one case in which paramedics rushing to aid an unconscious elderly woman suffering a heart attack were held up and had to meet the ambulance transporting the victim at the hospital instead of at the scene			0
details surrounding the woman 's death have n't been released			0
but the situation could deepen @entity3 's political woes , @entity56 said			1
" if a woman died here , " @entity56 said , " he 's in deep , deep trouble			1
" other documents raise questions , too controversy tarnishes @entity3 's image -- opinion @entity169 swarm @entity3 is now campaigning for fellow @entity8 governors as chairman of the @entity280 and is seen as prime political target for national @entity169			1
they rarely attacked him during his re-election campaign but are now becoming more aggressive with the bridge controversy unfolding			0
" these revelations are troubling for any public official , but they also indicate what we 've come to expect from governor @entity3 - when people oppose him , he exacts retribution			2
when people question him , he belittles and snidely jokes			0
and when anyone dares to look into his administration , he bullies and attacks , " said rep. @entity294 , the @entity295 chair , in a statement			0
a source close to @entity3 said " there will probably be some sacrificial firing and that 'll be it			2
" @entity0 's @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , and @entity310 contributed to this report			0
