@entity2 , @entity3 -- " have you been to @entity1 yet ? " my friend asked eagerly over the phone			1
it was my third week as a resident of @entity2 , and i could no longer claim the pure shock of moving to a city so sprawling , so overwhelming , as the reason i had yet to explore its most interesting neighborhoods			1
but i had to answer " no. " in a city as vast as @entity2 , @entity1 seemed especially impenetrable , a huge warren of restaurants , markets , strip malls and residences			1
as much as i knew that it held a treasure trove of food , culture and nightlife , i was intimidated to even get started			0
now , almost a year later , @entity1 is one of my favorite things about living in @entity2			1
it 's like having an entire other city within a city , a gloriously foreign one at that			2
there are places in @entity1 where you look around and swear you are in @entity34			1
and yet , it 's also 100 % @entity2 : a strange , sprawling melting pot full of hidden delights			1
here are eight things to know about @entity1 , things that i hope will help make discovering this neighborhood a little less daunting			1
15 things to do around @entity2 it 's big @entity1 is west of downtown and south of @entity45 and is considered part of the @entity48 district			1
its borders are somewhat amorphous and have shifted over time , but the neighborhood 's generally accepted area is around 3 square miles and has one of the densest populations in @entity2			1
in the 1920s and ' 30s it was very much a swinging spot for @entity45 celebrities , and was the location of the @entity58 , which hosted the @entity59 in the ' 30s and ' 40s ( and was also the site of the @entity62 assassination )			0
though the ambassador was torn down in 2005 , you can still see some remnants of that old glamor in other buildings scattered among the newer strip malls and construction			0
the ever - changing flavor of @entity2 's @entity1 the neighborhood has seen turmoil heavy @entity74 settlement in the area cemented the neighborhood as @entity1 in the 1970s , when many @entity76 immigrated to @entity3			1
in 1992 @entity1 bore the brunt of much of the violence and looting that happened during the @entity2 riots , and many @entity81 fled to the suburbs after the riots			1
but renewed development in the early 2000s , plus a new subway line with stations in the neighborhood , led to a revitalization of the area			2
most of the residents are @entity91 this is a tri-lingual neighborhood : wherever you go , you will hear @entity74 , @entity95 and @entity96 , and often times a mashup of all three			0
this blend of cultures has led to some of @entity2 's most recognized food , such as @entity104 's @entity103 tacos , the original @entity74 taco truck			1
@entity104 , who is @entity74 but grew up surrounded by @entity2 's @entity91 influences , channels a completely authentic experience of @entity110 's melting pot. while @entity2 has the nation 's largest @entity74 population and @entity81 make up the largest nationality in the neighborhood ( 22 % , according to demographic analysis ) most of the residents of @entity1 are @entity91 : 58 %			1
but you can also find @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and all manner of @entity124 residents , businesses and eateries in the area			1
@entity1 never sleeps twenty - four - hour restaurants are just the beginning			2
@entity1 is home to more nightlife than many other entire cities can claim , from dive bars to high - end cocktail speakeasies , from karaoke clubs to establishments that must be a business of some sort , on the second level of a strip mall with a sign in @entity74 and people coming and going at 4 a.m. there 's a lot of mystery here , but also a lot on full display			1
a few spots to get you started : in the dive bar category there 's @entity152 bar ( 3377 @entity153 ) with all you can drink beer and soju for $ 21.99			0
@entity156 ( 239 s. @entity157 ) is a new speakeasy where you have to try different doorknobs from the foyer to get in			0
inside , it 's all @entity161 meets 1920s @entity45 glam			0
the tucked - away spot is fronted by @entity164 , a walk - up restaurant serving international snacks late			0
@entity1 is said to have the highest concentration of restaurants and nightclubs in @entity3			2
my @entity1 nightlife of choice ? karaoke			2
most karaoke clubs here have private rooms , so you and your friends can sing your hearts out without having to deal with a bunch of drunk strangers ' off - key wailings			0
try @entity184 ( 3240 @entity153 , suite 401 ) , a swank club with private rooms and songs in @entity74 , @entity188 and @entity96			0
if strangers ' off - key wailings is what you 're in the mood for , you can hit up @entity192 ( 3440 @entity153 ) , a more @entity124 karaoke dive bar that 's good for sloppy fun			2
there is a lot of good food here @entity1 is home to some of the country 's best @entity74 barbecue ( check out @entity202 's and @entity203 for high quality meat as well as fantastic banchan , or small side dishes served with rice ) , but there 's so , so much more to explore			1
soup , porridge , raw fish salads , stews -- every @entity74 specialty you can imagine exists in this neighborhood			0
it 's hard to even begin to list favorites -- every @entity218 has a @entity1 hole in the wall they want to rave to you about			2
the fun is in getting out there and finding your own personal must - try dish			0
korean food is n't all that 's on the menu @entity1 is home to more than just @entity74 -- for instance , @entity229 , one of the city 's best @entity231 restaurants , lives in the heart of @entity1			1
expect amazing moles , live music on weekends , a ton of families sharing huge platters of grilled meats , and fun fruity tropical mezcal cocktails			0
@entity243 , a newer craft beer bar , finds its home in an odd building behind one of @entity1 's strip malls and serves killer bar food along with one of the best beer selections in the city			1
and the rest of the neighborhood 's diverse population means tremendous eateries are tucked throughout			2
for more on the neighborhood 's food , check out some of @entity259 's recent culinary stops in the gallery above and tune in for " @entity262 " on sunday at 9 p.m. et. $ 15 spa day ? yes , please @entity74 spas are a lovely and affordable way to pamper yourself , and @entity1 has a whole slew of options			1

stinky , spicy souvenirs abound there are some amazing kimchi purveyors in @entity1 , stores that sell jars of fermented cabbage and other delicious banchan			0
seek out artisan producers like the folks at @entity295 ( 1010 s. @entity296 ) where owners have been making kimchi for 35 years			0
