-- @entity1 and @entity2 have been dating for six years , and though they do n't see each other regularly , they value their relationship			1
a decade ago , when they did n't even know each other , @entity1 and @entity2 were diagnosed with schizophrenia ; from that moment their love lives became a more complex issue than most people have to deal with			1
@entity2 describes herself as an introverted woman			2
she is 42 years old and was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 33			1
" i did n't take care of myself			1
i did n't want to shower and i was not wearing clothes for my age , " she remembers			1
" i was very depressed			2
my dad was concerned and decided to take me to a doctor			2
" @entity1 , 46 , says he passed out while he was working back in 2000			1
he did n't realize that from that moment he was going to start experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia , a mental disorder suffered by approximately 1.5 million @entity23			1
" i began to have delusion of persecution			2
i was very stressed , " he says			2
" this led me to be a person that was very hard to deal with			2
i used to think that people knew what i was going to say , that people could read my mind			2
i was living in a permanent state of stress , i was paranoiac and it was horrible			2
" the couple met in a therapy group			2
@entity2 says she is happy now that she has someone to talk with			0
" i do n't have a lot of people to talk with about my personal issues because they do n't believe me or they do n't want to help me with my deliriums , " she says			1
@entity1 was married when he was diagnosed			1
he says his wife did n't know " how to understand " that he was suffering from a mental disorder and that is why she decided to leave him			1
she does n't allow @entity1 to stay in touch with his kids			1
" my oldest daughter is now 19			0
the other two were really young the last time i saw them , " he says			0
" they do n't recognize me			1
a year ago my ex-wife allowed me to meet with my daughter -- she told me she was going to college to be a psychologist			0
i kissed her and hugged her , but she told me she needed time to understand this situation			1
since then , she has n't answered my letters or phone calls			1
" @entity59 , a psychologist and researcher at the @entity61 in @entity23 explains that schizophrenia is a degenerative chronic disease that alters human senses ; this leads the patient to suffer delusion of persecution , to hear voices or even think that water tastes like acid			1
it prevents the patient from having a clear perception of what is real and what is not , she says			0
for @entity1 , the main reason to get better is to recover his children			1
however , he knows that to achieve this , he will need to become financially stable again , in order to help support his children			0
" i lost everything because of the schizophrenia , " he says			1
@entity59 says that in some cases family members are not aware of what a patient is going through after the diagnosis of a mental disorder , and that leads them to leave them			1
" the family stigmatizes their sick relative because they are also suffering a social stigma ; they feel pushed back and do the same to their loved one			0
having a relationship while you are handling with that negative interaction of the rejection , it could be very difficult			0
" according to the @entity61 of @entity23 , 28 % of the @entity23 population has suffered from some type of mental disorder , such as emotional disorders or anxiety			1
the @entity102 in @entity23 made by the @entity103 to prevent discrimination in 2010 showed that 20 % of people with disabilities are discriminated against			0
for another patient , @entity108 , who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1996 , discrimination was a complex difficulty during her rehabilitation			1
she and her husband worked in the same company , but when @entity108 started to show symptoms such as deliriums and hallucinations , the husband 's co-workers started to joke about it , making him feel bad			0
he felt pressure to quit his job			0
after the couple left their jobs , their relationship ended because of their financial struggles			0
in 1994 she moved with her 4 - year - old son to her mother 's house			0
" in 1990 , i started to hear voices everywhere			0
i tried to run away , i closed doors and windows in my house to avoid hearing them , but it was useless			0
i heard laughs and people gossiping about me while walking in the street			0
i heard them even on the tv and on the radio , " @entity108 remembers			0
the stress due to a lack of job security exaggerated her disease , she adds			2
five years after she separated from her husband , her son confessed that his father was already living with another family			0
@entity108 did not feel angry			0
" i felt good for him , he found happiness , something he did n't have with me			2
" during a job interview -- a couple of years after she started her treatment -- she met her current partner			0
" we see each other a few times , not very often because he has a family , " she says			0
" we keep our relation secret ; my son does n't know about it and thinks he is only a friend of mine			2
" as part of her rehabilitation therapy , @entity108 attends a radio show called @entity171 every week			0
it is hosted by people who previously had a mental disease and is produced by the psychologist @entity175			1
it airs from @entity177 in @entity178			0
@entity175 describes the radio show as a space for dialogue , which offers a safe environment in which people suffering from a mental disorder can express themselves			1
in three years , @entity175 says , relationships with a partner have been a recurrent topic of discussion among the participants			0
" the issues with love ... ( are ) deeply human			2
to listen to what they think about love is a great way to get closer to them and to understand that we are not living in distant worlds , that there are bridges that can help us go from one world to another			2
" " we are lonely people , " @entity108 affirms			0
she is ready to find a man who has n't suffered from any mental disorder and is willing to commit			1
this is not the case for another patient , @entity207 , 42 ; he admits to being comfortable without a girlfriend			1
since he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , eight years ago , he has become more social because of the workshops he has gone to as part of his rehabilitation process			2
" because of the disease , i became unfriendly and shy , " he says			2
" in my life i have made few friends , the majority in my childhood			0
when i was sick i felt like a monster			0
i did n't understand what my physical constitution was			1
" @entity207 has n't been able to understand what happened to the 15 years of his life before he was diagnosed with a mental disorder at the age of 34			1
@entity225 made him think he could communicate telepathically with his ancestors and he was feeling that everything was an aggression against him			0
he says he already has overcome that phase			0
now @entity207 compares himself with the movie " @entity237 " ( " @entity238 " ) , in which a man wakes up after 20 years in coma , without understanding that his country , his family and his world have changed			1
" i 've never been in a romantic relationship			0
it is difficult to be in a relationship with someone with a mental disease ; you have a lot of issues , " @entity207 says			1
" i ca n't be with a person like me			1
i would like to be with someone that did n't have a mental disorder			1
