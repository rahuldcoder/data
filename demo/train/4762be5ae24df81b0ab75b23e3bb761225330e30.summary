-- @entity2 's immigration plan could be a breakthrough moment for conservatives			1
it could be a new kind of signal from conservatives that we are not bound in an absolutist straitjacket when it comes to immigration reform			0
first and foremost , @entity13 's solution to illegal immigration is not amnesty			1
his plan would create a narrow and demanding path to legality , not to full citizenship			0
according to his " 21st century contract with @entity20 , " solving @entity20 's immigration problem would begin with full control of the border by january 1 , 2014			1
all government resources necessary would be made available for this , including " round - the - clock drone flights " and " multi-layer , strategic fencing in urban areas			0
" additionally , @entity13 's plan would reform the legal visa system , offer incentives for the best brains in the world to come to @entity20 ( with @entity37 skilled work visas ) , develop a legal guest - worker program run by corporations outside of the government , and make @entity42 the official language of government			1
a majority of conservatives agree with these reforms			0
where they differ right now is on @entity13 's plan for legality for the illegal immigrants already in the country			1
@entity13 's call for a " humane " immigration policy in last tuesday 's @entity0 debate sounded too much like amnesty to many conservatives			1
but a closer look at @entity13 's plan might change minds			1
@entity13 's immigration plan would only grant legality , not full citizenship , to anyone who has entered the country illegally should they meet stringent requirements			1
anyone with a criminal record would be ineligible and subject to deportation , as well as those who entered the country recently and have no commercial or family ties to the @entity20			0
only those who can sustain themselves without government assistance ( @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , etc. ) and pay for their own private health insurance would be eligible to stay			0
an independent , local " citizen 's review " board would grant legal status based on the requirements above as well as the immigrant 's standing in his or her community			0
should they be permitted to stay , they will still be subject to a $ 5,000 penalty			0
@entity13 's plan is strict and nuanced			1
but more importantly , it could be a sign of a new conservative philosophy			1
as he said in the debate , " i do not believe that the people of the @entity20 are going to take people who have been here a quarter century , who have children and grandchildren , who are members of the community , who may have done something 25 years ago , separate them from their families , and expel them			0
" some of @entity13 's fellow @entity106 presidential contenders seized on this statement and used it against him			2
@entity110 called his plan amnesty and said it would give 11 million illegal immigrants a free pass			2
campaigning in @entity117 after the @entity0 debate , gov. @entity116 was also quick to call @entity13 's plan amnesty			1
other prominent conservatives , like @entity117 's rep. @entity121 , bristled at @entity13 's plan , saying it would be another magnet or incentive for illegal immigrants to enter the country and set up a family			2
now that @entity13 is a legitimate frontrunner in the @entity106 presidential race his plan will be fully vetted , as it should be			2
there are some legitimate concerns			0
how big is this group of illegal immigrants we 're talking about ? if @entity13 's plan would legalize 1 million , and the actual problem is 10 - 15 million , it 's not much of a solution			2
how can an illegal immigrant have stayed here 25 years legally without having broken additional laws such as filing taxes with a false social security number or receiving welfare without being eligible ? another question : why not just focus on enforcement first ? once it is achieved , @entity20 would be much more open to additional reforms and possible accommodations			0
despite these serious and consequential objections , @entity13 has the nation 's attention right now and should use this moment to offer a full , detailed explanation of his immigration plan to the @entity20 people			1
it is not a perfect , comprehensive plan , but it 's a starting point and moves the conversation in the right direction			2
conservatives have long been victim to the liberal argument that they would mass deport all illegal immigrants			0
@entity13 offers a serious alternative that needs to be debated			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168			0

@entity2 's immigration plan has been attacked as " amnesty "
@entity173 says the plan is nuanced and strict and *deserves* study
he says it *emphasizes* border security and *attracting* skilled workers
@entity168 : @entity13 plan could be a breakthrough for conservative philosophy on immigration
