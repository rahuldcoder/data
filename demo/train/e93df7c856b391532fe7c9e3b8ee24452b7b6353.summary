-- imagine a bicycle that was more than a means to get you to work in the morning , but a personal assistant to boot			1
it could shield you from oncoming traffic , look up weather conditions in advance , anticipate the road ahead and make adjustments to your journey			1
imagine it could also double as smog filter , fit compactly on your bookshelf , and even fly			1
okay , so your bicycle wo n't be able to do all those things at once , but hey , any one of those features makes for a pretty cool ride			2
want to know what the future will bring ? read on to see how tomorrow 's bicycles might look			0
the smog muncher as a mode of transportation , bikes are about as environmentally friendly as it gets			2
the @entity29 based @entity28 and @entity30 , however , has upped cycling 's already soaring ecological ante with its concept for an air - purifying bike			1
it has a carbon monoxide and dust filter mounted at the front and the theory is that with the help of a lithium - ion battery , the aluminum frame would use electricity to generate oxygen from an onboard water tank			1
at the moment , the idea exists solely as artistic renderings ( the company has yet to make a prototype , though one is supposedly in the works )			0
still , the idea shows potential , as evidenced by the fact that it recently won a @entity54			0
" @entity56 " speeder according to @entity59 's many depictions of the future , we should all be making our travels via flying car or hover board			0
while the present - day is irksomely @entity66 - bound , there was recently a modest nod to the world we 've been promised for decades by the entertainment industry			2
@entity71 - based engineering company @entity70 has created a flying " hover bike " that looks like it was plucked from the set of @entity56			2
the " @entity77 bike " floats with the help of ducted fans , and is fairly low - altitude ( soaring up to a maximum 15 feet -- 4.6 meters )			1
read more : the 18 propeller helicopter the current version is only a proof - of - concept used for development , but @entity70 says it is now working now on a production version			1
alas , it is unlikely the bike will ever be available for popular consumption , but will likely be limited to agricultural and humanitarian uses			0
the smartest bike in the room first conceived at @entity92 's @entity91 , the @entity90 is a wireless device that turns any ordinary bike into an electronic hybrid			1
the wheel captures energy when the rider is going over easy terrain ( i.e. downhill ) and stores it in a battery pack			2
conversely , the saved energy is used to give riders an electronic push when traversing difficult landscapes			0
the device has a sensor which learns the rider 's individual style , and also anticipates aspects of the ride ahead , including road conditions and carbon monoxide levels			2
riders are also able to control the wheel with their smartphones ; they can lock and unlock it , track usage statistics ( including calories burned and elevation climbed ) and select a level of motor assistance			2
@entity122 brought the wheel to the market last month , and has started taking pre-orders for $ 799			0
laser footprint in the last few years , the number of cyclists on the road has skyrocketed , which is great for many reasons			1
unfortunately , the amount of cyclist casualties has risen dramatically as well			0
to combat the problem , a physics student from @entity135 , in @entity136 , invented @entity138 , a front - mounted lamp that projects a green laser image five meters in front of a bicycle to let other road users know it is coming			1
the aim is to help prevent vehicles from turning across a cyclist 's path by increasing his or her " footprint " on the road			1
watch this : @entity154 's road racers bike in a box forget what engineering experts say , according to @entity160 manufacturer firm @entity159 , putting together a bike is about as complicated as making lunch			1
this month , the company has just started international shipments of the world 's first flat - pack , self - assembly bicycles			0
" if you can make a sandwich , you can make a @entity170 , " or so goes the company motto			0
at â ‚ ¬ 799.00 ( $ 1,086 ) , the price may seem a bit steep for a bike you build yourself , but then again , all the materials are locally and responsibly sourced , and each bike is tested for weatherproofing for six weeks in a climate control room at an independent wood research institute			0
the bike comes delivered in a compact box bearing 19 parts made from a combination of beech plywood and aluminum			0
supposedly , it can be constructed in as little as 45 minutes .			0
