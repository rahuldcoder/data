ok , at this point , who does n't have a music streaming service ? according to a new report , @entity3 will be entering the crowded field this summer , joining such rivals as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 in trying to find new , profitable ways for digital users to get their tunes			1
the company plans to make on - demand music streaming available as part of its prime service by june or july , according to @entity18 , which cited five unnamed music - industry sources in its report			1
@entity21 will , at least initially , restrict its music offerings to songs and albums that are at least 6 months old , according to the report			2
even with a $ 20 price increase in march that bumped its annual cost to $ 99 , many users already considered @entity21 one of the @entity31 's best bargains			0
for $ 8.25 per month , members get two - day shipping on many purchases and the ability to borrow kindle books and watch streaming movies and tv shows for free			1
before march , the price of @entity21 had n't changed since it debuted nine years ago			0
free music streaming would be one more reason for people to sign up and , perhaps more important to @entity3 , would keep them in the company 's corner of the @entity46 , where spending money is always just a click away			1
the move comes as consumer tastes are veering sharply in the direction of streaming as opposed to outright purchases			0
digital music sales were down roughly 13 % in the first quarter of this month , according to @entity56			0
meanwhile , revenues for subscription streaming services were up 51 % in 2013			0
the market is led by @entity60 , the internet radio service that 's the most popular music - streaming platform in the @entity62 , and @entity63 , an on - demand service that has a large following in @entity66			1
but web heavyweights are muscling into their turf as well			0
@entity69 , @entity8 's @entity70 and @entity9 's @entity71 all offer free streaming or monthly subscription plans			1
and this week , @entity9 confirmed plans to buy @entity75 and @entity76			0
much of the focus has been on @entity9 's pickup of the trendy headphones that millions already use with their ipods and iphones			0
but @entity9 also gets a music - streaming service that , although it has only about 500,000 users so far , has been praised by critics for a suggestion engine that combines a complex algorithm with human curation			1
@entity3 did not immediately respond to messages seeing comment for this report			2
opinion : a remedy for @entity3 - @entity95 fight ?			2

@entity3 will offer free music - streaming on its prime service , report says
service would be available by next month but limited to older songs
@entity3 would join @entity9 , @entity7 , others in crowded streaming - music field
