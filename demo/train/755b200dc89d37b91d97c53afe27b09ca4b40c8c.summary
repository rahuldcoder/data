i think of myself as an " impatient optimist			0
" there are times , however , when it 's harder to muster the optimism , and the impatience takes over			2
that 's how i felt when i read about the hundreds of @entity9 schoolgirls kidnapped by the extremist group @entity10 to be married off or sold into slavery			1
it 's difficult to pinpoint the worst aspect of this atrocity			2
and it 's pitiful that this is nothing new			2
treating women as spoils or weapons of war has been a common practice for thousands of years			0
@entity10 has sought to justify its actions as consistent with @entity24 teachings , and this is an insult			1
many influential voices in the @entity28 world have rebuked the group 's actions			1
( to cite just one example , @entity31 of the @entity33 - based @entity32 , one of @entity35 's most prestigious theological institutions , said the kidnappings " completely contradict @entity35 and its principles of tolerance			0
" ) it 's frustrating that the @entity9 government , despite an intensifying effort to find the girls , has been unable to locate them			1
and it 's horrifying that hundreds of girls , their parents and thousands of their relatives are living each passing moment in escalating fear -- with no idea whether they 'll ever see each other again			1
my heart breaks for these mothers and fathers			0
but perhaps the most awful part of the story is that @entity10 stands against a better future for ordinary @entity9			1
@entity10 is committed to the idea that women are the property of husbands and mere instruments of reproduction			1
they are particularly opposed to the idea that girls ought to be educated , which is why they target schools			0
in fact , when girls are educated and free to pursue their passions , they contribute more to a thriving society			0
when women have a voice , they raise it to demand a life that is greater than what they 've been told they have a right to expect			0
and these demands change the future for everyone			0
@entity9 has a population of 170 million			2
its economy is the largest on the @entity91 continent			0
the future holds nearly boundless promise , as represented , in part , by the fact that the @entity96 is meeting in @entity97 right now			0
but if the country 's 85 million women and girls do n't have the opportunity to seize their potential , then neither will @entity9			1
there are countless examples of places around the world where women and girls are gaining power and autonomy , where the future looks brighter because women and girls are slowly wiping away the old gender norms			2
the impressive outpouring of support for the girls -- both within @entity9 communities and around the world -- is an encouraging sign that most people want the version of the future that empowered women and girls will create , not the version that @entity10 is trying to impose			1
it does n't help the @entity9 schoolgirls now , but thinking about the women and girls everywhere who are strong and getting stronger is one way to maintain some of the optimism that must go along with our collective impatience			1
