below is an excerpt from @entity4 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity3 's new book , " @entity5 : the doctors and @entity7 that are @entity8 " published by @entity9 , an imprint of @entity11			0
the following is from chapter two : a heart - stopping moment : " @entity5 : the doctors and @entity7 that are @entity16 , " just hit store shelves			1
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child waxed warm			2
-- 2 @entity28 4:34 , @entity29 @entity30 was driving home , an hour after finishing his run as a school bus driver in @entity34 , @entity35			1
he told me he does n't remember why he did n't come straight home from work that day			2
he thinks that maybe he went for a jog			0
a trim fifty - nine years old , @entity30 enjoyed a two - or three - mile run several days a week			1
maybe he was looking for a cheaper gas station than the one on his usual route or was just trying to avoid taking his @entity43 over a nasty set of new speed bumps			0
whatever the reason , whatever route he wandered , it brought @entity30 not to the usual entrance of his townhome complex , but the back driveway			1
the change in routine may have saved his life			1
@entity55 , a @entity56 driver , was making deliveries that wednesday afternoon , when he heard a terrible engine noise			1
thinking the sound was underneath his own hood , he pulled over			2
hopping out , @entity61 immediately realized that it was coming from a @entity43 almost directly across the street			0
it was an accident scene			2
the small silver car was piled up against a palm tree , the engine revving at top speed			2
the only thing keeping it in place was a stucco wall a few feet from the tree ; the car was wedged between the two			2
racing over , @entity61 could see that the driver had his eyes closed and seemed to be unconscious			2
the driver 's foot was wedged against the accelerator			2
ignoring the chance that the car might break free and crush him , @entity61 reached across the slumped body and turned off the ignition			2
he dragged @entity30 out of the car and laid him on the ground			1
after dialing 911 , @entity61 started cpr the way he 'd learned during an @entity89 training exercise just two months before			2
as he listened to the ambulance siren , racing up the road from @entity92 154 barely a mile away , @entity61 began to pump hard on @entity30 ' chest			1
studies show that when a bystander jumps in , the chances of survival in a cardiac arrest case increase exponentially			1
even though it may not seem like you are accomplishing much , simply pushing the heart and circulating the blood can make a tremendous difference			1
@entity30 had that going for him , but he was also fortunate to have collapsed in @entity34			1
paramedics there are at the forefront of a revolution in emergency care			0
with a few simple measures -- going against the grain of the medical establishment -- they have found that they can radically improve the odds of surviving a cardiac arrest			1
the fire engine pulled up with a screech , and a brawny firefighter named @entity117 jumped to the curb			2
as fellow firefighters scrambled down , @entity117 thumped an urgent rhythm on @entity30 ' chest , two hundred compressions over two minutes , before a medic stepped in and delivered an electric shock from the paddles of a defibrillator			1
win a signed copy of dr. @entity3 's book then came another two hundred compressions , then shock , two hundred compressions , then shock			0
finally , after six hundred thumps and three defibrillator shocks , a weak pulse returned			0
@entity30 was back from the dead			1
at no point was mouth - to - mouth resuscitation performed , and at no point did @entity30 get a breath			1
surprisingly , that may be the real reason he survived			0
in reality , survival from cardiac arrest outside the hospital is rare			1
until very recently , @entity35 was in line with the rest of the country -- only about 2 percent of the victims pulled through without long - term damage			1
but in 2005 , cities around @entity35 began doing something new			0
it went against the guidelines of the @entity155 and the teaching practices of major medical schools and hospitals			0
this new method did n't look like the cpr that had been taught in every @entity161 , firehouse , school , and church ever since the 1970s			0
in short , it was a radical experiment			0
the experiment sprang from two lines of thinking : animal studies aimed at modifying cpr technique and a public health effort to train more people in cpr			0
if your heart gives out while you 're walking down the street , the number - one thing that can save your life is to have a bystander who is not only trained in @entity160 , but willing to help			1
unfortunately , such help is rare			0
published studies put the rate of bystander cpr at around 20 percent			0
if you dig deep , the number really has nothing to do with the lack of desire			0
instead , study after study shows people are apprehensive about putting their mouth on someone else 's and maybe catching an infection from someone who 's on the ground dying			0
now , the reluctance can be overcome			0
in @entity198 , which has run massive training programs and public education campaigns since the 1970s , the rate of cpr assistance from bystanders is close to 50 percent			0
that one fact gets much of the credit for the city 's high survival rate from cardiac arrest			1
in recent years , a driving goal of the @entity207 has been to encourage more members of the public to jump in and help			0
but how ? there was simply no getting around mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			1

while driving home , @entity30 went into cardiac arrest and crashed his car
@entity56 driver @entity55 saw the accident , pulled @entity30 out and began cpr
cpr without mouth - to - mouth resuscitation may have saved @entity30 life
pushing the heart and circulating the blood can make a tremendous difference
