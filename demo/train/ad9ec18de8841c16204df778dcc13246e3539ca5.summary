-- there had to be something special about @entity3			1
here was a woman , after all , who managed to be a close friend of @entity7 and @entity8 , then a friend ( perhaps less close and more briefly ) of @entity10 and @entity11 , and then a very close ( " lots of love " ) friend of @entity15 and @entity16			2
given the personality differences between those involved , and given their political differences , it is at least surprising that any one person could be cosy with them all			2
and for one woman to overcome the jealousy and suspicion of @entity11 towards a former chum of @entity26 , and then of @entity27 towards a former chum of @entity11 and @entity26 , is nothing short of remarkable			2
looking back , it is hard to avoid the conclusion either that this woman was so powerful that politicians felt they had no choice but to clasp her to their bosoms , or that she was so amazingly nice and such utterly marvelous company that anybody would want her at their dinner table			1
giving evidence to @entity43 's inquiry on her relations with politicians , @entity40 did her very best to show us her amazingly nice and marvelous side -- even in the teeth of some pretty niggling questions from @entity49			1
demure and tidy beneath the famous mop of hair , she was polite and well - spoken , and always -- @entity53 - like -- controlled			2
but she also strove to appear warm , helpful and honorable			1
where @entity54 tried to provoke , she smiled			2
when he pushed her towards a corner , she became engagingly baffled by his perversity			2
her friendships were just normal , she implied			0
how often did she send text messages to the prime minister ? " i would text mr @entity27 , on occasion -- like a lot of people			0
" like you and me , perhaps			0
her persistent forgetfulness about almost anything substantive was , her expression implied , normal too			0
who remembers this kind of stuff ? as for influencing politicians , everything she did , she suggested , was driven by her loyalty not to @entity76 but to @entity77 's millions of readers , whom she could not or would not distinguish from " the nation " or " the country			1
" she acted " for the paper and for the readership , " and insofar as she had power it was as a kind of embodiment of her readers			0
so when she ( or @entity77 ) did something tough , as they did more than once to @entity92 , she wanted us to know that it was done for high - minded reasons , and with pain in her heart			0
notably when @entity77 dumped @entity11 on the morning after his annual party conference speech in 2009 , the timing was not , she said , designed to maximize damage , but to allow @entity11 a final opportunity to impress @entity77 readers in the speech			0
she also told us she tried to ring @entity11 just ahead of publication to warn him , as a " general courtesy " and because it was " the right thing to do			0
" when @entity77 published a story about the health of the @entity113 ' son , it was all done in the nicest possible way , and if the couple had had reservations she would have spiked it			0
all of this @entity54 greeted with an air of skepticism , but @entity40 's message was clear : " look at me			1
" what could be more natural than the @entity121 , @entity113 and @entity122 all falling in turn for such charms ? maybe you would too			0
mince pies and mulled wine in your @entity129 retreat ? invite @entity3			1
girls ' slumber party at @entity132 ? invite @entity3			1
but of course it ca n't be natural , as @entity43 himself stepped in to remind us			0
in one of his several pertinent interventions he spoke to @entity40 of " relationships you have been careful to develop for professional reasons , and doubtless coincidentally for personal reasons , over the years			1
" those words " doubtless coincidentally " carry a vast weight			0
even if @entity3 were @entity147 and @entity148 rolled into one , nobody could seriously believe that the professional and the personal reasons for her friendships with political leaders just happened to coincide			1
and @entity40 is nothing like @entity147 or @entity148			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156			1

evidence given by @entity159 *executive* @entity3 at media inquiry *highlighted* relations with politicians
@entity156 : through her evidence @entity40 strove to appear warm , helpful and honorable
it seemed to @entity156 that some of her comments and evidence were greeted with skepticism by legal counsel
