a series of revelations about the @entity3 's surveillance programs sparked outrage among many this week , including the expected privacy activists and civil libertarians			1
but there seems to be a gap between the roiling anger online and the attitudes of other people , especially younger ones , who think it 's just not that big a deal			1
it 's the rare issue that crosses party lines in terms of outrage , apathy and even ignorance			0
when interviewing people about the topic in downtown @entity25 , we found a number of people of all ages who had not heard the news , and more than one who asked what the @entity3 was			1
the rest had various reasons for not being terribly concerned			0
official : damage assessment over @entity38 intelligence - gathering leaks privacy is already dead when the news broke on wednesday , a number of people responded online by saying an extensive government surveillance program was n't surprising and just confirmed what they already knew			1
the lack of shock was n't limited to savvy technologists who have been following reports from organizations like the @entity51 , or @entity51 , that cover possible monitoring going back to 2007			1
many people already assumed that information online was easily accessible by corporations and the government			1
a survey conducted by the @entity58 just days before the @entity3 news broke found that 85 % of @entity38 already believed their phone calls , e-mails and online activity were being monitored			1
@entity63 from @entity64 , @entity65 , said he knew when he started using the internet that his information was n't going to be private , but still lamented that privacy no longer exists			0
" i do n't like it , but what can i do about it ? " he said			0
" i 'm just glad that we have as much freedom as we do			0
" @entity66 laughs about being spied on ok sacrificing privacy for security a national joint survey conducted in april by @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 found that 40 % of respondents were willing to give up some of their civil liberties for increased security			1
that survey was conducted after the @entity85 and before news of the @entity3 programs was public			1
" out of sight , out of mind , " is how @entity88 , 28 , responded to the news			2
the @entity93 resident said he would rather not know about the program , and thought its being public would make it easier for criminals to circumvent the government 's security programs			1
a @entity102 account @ _ nothingtohide quickly sprung up and started retweeting one of the more common reactions : people are n't worried about the @entity3 monitoring their calls or online activity because they believe they have no crimes or information to hide from the government			1
" if the government wants to look at my phone records to keep me safe ... so be it			2
i do n't have anything to hide , " tweeted @entity113			0
" @entity116 war only fought by intelligence gathering			0
we criticize those entrusted to keep us safe & scream when they fail to do so , " reads a tweet from @entity119			0
nearly half of @entity38 say the government would never abuse such an extensive trove of data			2
the @entity58 poll found that 48 % of @entity38 trust the government " some " or a " great deal " with their private data			2
@entity131 , president of the civil liberties group @entity132 , thinks the all or nothing view is flawed			1
" in a constitutional democracy like the @entity38 , the goal is to find the balance between security and liberty , not to sacrifice liberty for security , " she said			2
" i think that simply giving up on our privacy throws off the balance in a democracy between a government and its citizens			2
" how does it affect me ? nothing i can do recent surveys have shown that @entity38 in their teens and twenties share more of their lives online and are less concerned about digital privacy than older web users			0
for people who are not worried about the government seeing their personal communications , the revelations lack an immediate impact on their lives and there 's no urgent push to take action			1
" i think that at the moment , people may not feel the impact , but the fact that we have a secret agency that can access most of our digital lives -- i think that the loss will be felt over time , " @entity170 said			2
even people who disagree with the program might not think they can do anything about it			2
users still do n't know how the government is getting the information and what role the major @entity66 companies played in the snooping			0
there have been vehement , similar denials from the @entity184 of @entity185 and @entity186			0
these companies rightfully fear the accusations could damage their businesses , as people move to other web services that might be more secure			0
@entity170 recommended people who are concerned start by contacting their representatives in @entity194			1
" we are citizens in a democracy , " she said			0
" we can demand from our elected officials greater transparency			0
" opinion : the great privacy debate			0

some people are reacting to @entity3 news with *resignation* and lack of concern
many consider the monitoring by the government a necessary trade - off for increased security
for those who are upset and want to act , civil liberties activists recommend contacting @entity194
