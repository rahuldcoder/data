-- a @entity2 fact - finding team has found " massive evidence " that the highest levels of the @entity6 government are responsible for war crimes in the nation 's long - running civil war , the @entity2 's human rights chief said monday			1
@entity11 did n't name president @entity12 , but she said the evidence collected by the @entity2 @entity14 on @entity6 implicates the regime 's top man			0
the panel 's members have " outlined their view that the facts point to the commission of very serious crimes , war crimes , crimes against humanity , " @entity11 , the @entity2 high commissioner for human rights , told reporters in @entity19 , @entity20			1
" they point to the fact that the evidence indicates responsibility at the highest level of government , including the head of state			0
" still , @entity11 declined to say whether @entity12 was named in a list of suspects that the panel produced			0
the list is confidential -- not to be released until the matter goes from the fact - finding stage to a formal international investigation -- and even she has not read it , she said			0
@entity11 said the evidence also shows that rebels have committed war crimes and pointed to the fact that the majority of deaths -- more than 100,000 since the civil war began in 2011 -- are from unlawful attacks with conventional weapons , not from chemical weapons , which have gotten much of the attention in recent months			1
a joint @entity57 - @entity2 team charged with overseeing the destruction of @entity6 's chemical weapons began inspecting sites in october			2
the @entity62 resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid- 2014 for @entity6 to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences			2
the goal is to move the most dangerous chemicals out of the country as quickly as possible , said @entity70 , head of the joint team			0
but the presence of chemical weapons inspectors has not stopped the influx of conventional weapons into @entity6 's civil war			1
as recently as september , @entity78 officials confirmed that they sent artillery described as light weapons , some anti-tank weapons and ammunition to @entity6 rebels , and @entity84 has long supplied arms to the @entity6 's government			1
@entity11 called on @entity2 member states to refer the report to the @entity89 , a move that might be blocked by the @entity62 , where @entity84 and @entity91 have so far blocked efforts that could punish the @entity12 regime .			0

report accuses " the highest levels of @entity6 's government " of war crimes
rebels are also implicated in the commission of war crimes , report says
war crimes in @entity6 are " very serious crimes *...* crimes against humanity "
the majority of people have been *killed* by conventional weapons , not chemical ones
