-- abandoned workshops and empty warehouses are getting a new lease of life in @entity5			1
spaces that once housed production lines are now becoming creative hotspots for artists , designers and musicians living in a city that holds the title of @entity14 for 2014			1
this urban regeneration might be most true in one of @entity5 's oldest suburbs : @entity18			1
visitors to the area can see the busy harbor to the north and the majestic @entity23 to the south			0
but most people wandering around the area are n't here for the views -- with its craft stores , art markets , theaters and award - winning restaurants , this is a hot address for young urbanites			0
based here is also the @entity36 , a converted building that has now become a hive of retail activity			0
" when we started we knew we had made the best decision to be based in @entity18 specifically , " says @entity39 , a founding partner of @entity40 , a well - known local pottery collective located at the @entity42 " after two or three years we realized we 've got to maximize on whatever we do and we 've had a lot of customers coming from overseas to see our work			1
" @entity18 is also home to an old brewery that has now been turned into an office hub , mostly catering for small advertising and film production firms			1
" buildings in the area really lend themselves to being converted , " says @entity53 , one of the architects involved in the redesign of the @entity56			0
" @entity18 used to have a lot of clothing workshops and factories , so the high ceilings and generous spaces really work for the artistic community			1
" economic benefits this sector is an important component of @entity69 's economy			1
the visual arts contribute nearly $ 90 million to the country 's gdp and provide employment to almost 18,000 people , according to the @entity75			1
but the craft sector is even more significant when it comes to generating income			0
the sector contributes about $ 985 million annually to gdp and employs approximately 38,000 people			1
@entity69 's government is trying to build on these areas with its @entity83			2
minister of arts and culture @entity84 has announced a number of partnerships with local community leaders and artists in a bid to stimulate creativity in communities and help beautify areas			2
overall , the program is projected to create 5,000 short - term jobs between 2013 and 2015			0
one person who is well - aware of the economic potential @entity69 design has to offer is @entity98			2
the company she started with her husband , " source , " is all about finding local designers and getting them started in the global market			0
" our design industry is ready , " says @entity98 , who 's also the founder of the @entity105 -- a stable of local talent creating design art and investment pieces			0
" a cool market , but in a commercial environment			0
" design legacy her goal is to stimulate the industry and the majority of the work is happening in @entity18			2
the regeneration of the area is one of the reasons that the @entity124 has crowed @entity5 the @entity14 -- a title the city will hold until the end of the year			1
past title holders that have received recognition for driving urban development through design include @entity134 's capital city @entity132 and @entity135 in @entity136			0
@entity5 is the first city on the @entity69 continent to have been given the title , which was first bestowed on @entity139 in @entity140 in 2008			1
but has the title led to real benefits for the city ? " there has been a fantastic response , " says @entity53			0
" there has been an uplifting of the city as people are really making public spaces better			0
" but there is a sense that the real benefits wo n't be immediately obvious			0
" i think this is far more intrinsic and deeper than anybody anticipates and it 's only going to be in years to come that we really see the critical impact that world design capital has had on @entity5 , " says @entity98			2
" it 's all very well to want the proof right here and right now but for a young industry , we 're really are doing the best we can and the legacy that 's going to be left behind after the year is over			0
" this longer - term perspective is also on the mind of @entity167 , ceo of @entity168 -- the body which implements the requirements of the @entity14 organization			2
" there has been added impetus in 2014 for @entity69 policy - makers to talk about design , " she says			1
" @entity177 , provincial and national government agencies are convening on design issues and the @entity14 title has really accelerated those conversations			2
" as the end of 2014 comes into sight , and with it the close of @entity5 's reign as @entity14 , citizens will hope the year in the spotlight will have a lasting impact on the city 's public spaces			1
