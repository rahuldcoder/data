@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has outlived two husbands , her two children and decades of bygone immigration laws			1
at 101 , @entity3 will become a @entity8 citizen on the 101st anniversary of her crossing into the @entity8 from @entity11			1
the naturalization ceremony will take place tuesday afternoon in a federal courtroom in @entity0 , @entity1 , according to the @entity16 's @entity15			1
@entity3 described the feeling of becoming a citizen with one word : " @entity20 , " @entity21 for " free			1
" and then in a feisty @entity21 voice that makes it hard to believe she 's only 4 - foot - 7 , she explained why becoming a citizen at this late stage of her life is so important			2
" i want to spend the rest of my days in this life living legally in the @entity8 , " @entity3 told @entity2 this week			1
" i was raised here , and i want to die here			2
" @entity3 also said she feels @entity8 in every way but knows that technically she 's not an @entity8 , at least not yet			1
@entity33 's path to citizenship is a tale that captures the unusual way of life on the @entity11 border			2
on october 12 , 1909 , @entity3 was just a baby in her mother 's arms crossing the @entity41 on a ferry boat from @entity43 , @entity11 , into @entity0 , @entity1			1
in those days , crossing the border was a simple routine			2
there were no border patrol agents , and checkpoints focused on customs and trade issues , according to @entity50 , a history professor at the @entity51 at @entity0 specializing in @entity8 - @entity11 border relations			1
" we were on the fringe back in those days , " said @entity50			2
" it was n't hard to cross the border			2
there was nobody looking to round people up and send them back to @entity11			2
" @entity3 and her single mother settled into a quiet life in @entity0			1
her mother earned money washing clothes , but she never met her father			0
@entity3 dropped out of school after third grade			1
" i did n't want to go anymore , " @entity3 said			1
so then she started helping her mother sift through the growing piles of laundry that needed to be washed and folded			0
@entity3 married her first husband at 16 ; he died five years later			1
shortly after , she married her second husband and had two children			0
in 1940 , @entity73 passed the @entity74 , which made it a federal crime to advocate overthrowing the government			2
but the law also required noncitizens already in the country to register with the government			0
@entity3 did so along with millions of others in the @entity8			1
just before the start of @entity74 , @entity3 received a " certificate of lawful entry " card from the @entity8 government issued to her on april 4 , 1941			1
she never imagined that little document would make it possible for her to become a @entity8 citizen			0
she figured it came with an expiration date			0
for decades , @entity3 did n't really know what her legal status was in the @entity8			1
she feared asking too many questions might get her deported			0
she crossed the border routinely to visit family in @entity11			2
border agents rarely asked for any documentation and when they did , she simply called herself a @entity8 citizen			0
then in 2008 , the @entity8 started requiring everyone to show a passport when crossing the border			0
@entity3 knew she could n't take anymore chances ; it was time to find out once and for all where she stood			1
@entity3 's niece , @entity102 , took her to the @entity15 office in @entity0 , and that 's where they met @entity107 , a 29 - year veteran of the government agency			1
" i fell in love with her			0
she 's real feisty , " @entity110 told @entity2			0
when @entity110 tried finding @entity33 's name in the computer system , she could n't find it			0
" if you came to us before we entered the computer age , we did n't have your records , " said @entity110			0
so @entity3 pulled out that 69 - year - old " lawful entry " card			1
her niece says she took care of that little piece of paper for decades			0
" the permit is perfectly cared for , " said @entity102			0
" she 's a perfect lady			0
" with that document , government officials were able to find her @entity128 documents in the archives in @entity130			0
" we would never have been able to establish her registration status without that document , " said @entity131 , a public affairs officer with the @entity15			0
" it would have been hard to prove			0
" the paperwork is all squared away			0
@entity3 passed the citizenship exam and now 101 years after that short ferry ride across the @entity41 with her mother , @entity33 is set to become a citizen of the @entity8			1
it will be an emotional day for @entity3 's family , but they 've never seen her cry and they wonder if this will be the day they 'll see a tear			1
" quien sabe ? " said @entity3			2
" who knows ? "			0

@entity3 still had 69 - year - old " lawful entry " card given to her in 1941
in 1908 , @entity3 was a baby when she crossed the @entity41 into @entity0 , @entity1
naturalization ceremony will take place tuesday in a federal courtroom in @entity0
