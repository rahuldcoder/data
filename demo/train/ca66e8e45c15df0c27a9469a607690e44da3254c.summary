@entity0 -- president @entity2 challenged @entity3 to join him in taking on " our generation 's task " to ignite the growth of a " rising , thriving middle class , " using the first @entity10 address of his second term to prod @entity13 to compromise on the major challenges facing the nation			1
" it is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities , you can get ahead , no matter where you come from , what you look like , or who you love , " @entity2 said tuesday night , sounding familiar themes from his re-election campaign last year			2
the president emphasized economic growth and job creation , and insisted that his proposals would not increase the nation 's deficit , though the @entity34 offered no price tag on his initiatives			2
he also made an emotional plea for @entity3 to hold votes on controversial proposals for tougher gun laws after the @entity42 , @entity43 , shootings in december that killed 20 schoolchildren			1
at the same time , @entity2 called for legislators to work together for the good of the nation , saying @entity51 " expect us to put the nation 's interests before party			1
" " they do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can , " he said			0
" for they know that @entity51 moves forward only when we do so together , and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all			0
" 5 things we learned it was his fourth @entity10 address and seventh speech to a joint sitting of @entity3 , and analysts considered it a crucial moment for setting the tone for the political dialogue after four years of partisan division and congressional dysfunction			1
in the @entity13 response , sen. @entity72 of @entity73 signaled little acceptance of what @entity2 proposed , repeating longstanding @entity13 criticism of what he described as job - killing , growth - snuffing bigger government			1
" presidents in both parties -- from @entity86 to @entity87 -- have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle - class prosperity , " said @entity72 , a tea party favorite considered the a rising star in the @entity13			1
" but president @entity2 ? he believes it 's the cause of our problems			1
" according to @entity72 , the president 's solution " to virtually every problem we face is for @entity0 to tax more , borrow more and spend more			1
" @entity1 @entity98 : @entity72 says @entity99 needs a check up with both sides sticking to deeply entrenched positions , the night of competing messages signaled continued partisan division and political showdowns in @entity0 over the federal budget and further steps to reduce the deficit and national debt			1
" in many ways , what we heard tonight is the same old , same old argument , " noted @entity1 chief political analyst @entity110			0
former house speaker @entity115 told @entity1 that @entity72 helped himself as a @entity13 leader , while @entity117 , the former @entity118 governor of @entity119 , accused the @entity73 senator of missing an opportunity to appeal to the political center because he overstated @entity13 talking points			1
to @entity1 senior political analyst @entity124 , @entity72 emerged as an attractive figure on the @entity51 political stage but was short on specifics			2
opinion : @entity2 dares @entity3 to get the job done " i do n't think they won the arguments tonight , " @entity124 said of @entity13			1
the government faces deep spending cuts mandated by a previous agreement between @entity2 and @entity3 to raise the federal debt ceiling , and @entity2 renewed his call on tuesday night for a comprehensive deficit - reduction plan that includes new tax revenue coupled with spending cuts			2
taking aim at the bitter partisanship of his first term , @entity2 said " let 's set party interests aside , and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future			1
" " and let 's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors , " he continued to applause , mainly from @entity118			0
" the greatest nation on @entity158 can not keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next			0
we ca n't do it			0
let 's agree , right here , right now , to keep the people 's government open , and pay our bills on time , and always uphold the full faith and credit of the @entity51			0
" in a jab at congressional republicans who seek to shrink deficits and the size of government through deep spending cuts , saying " deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan			0
" @entity72 's response blamed @entity2 for weakening @entity51 stability and potential by continued deficit spending and failing to take on needed reforms to entitlement programs such as @entity185 and @entity186			1
" the real cause of our debt is that our government has been spending $ 1 trillion more than it takes in every year			0
that 's why we need a balanced budget amendment , " he said , accusing @entity191 of wanting to leave @entity186 unchanged so that it goes bankrupt			0
opinion : in 2013 , democracy talks back about @entity10 however , @entity2 called for " modest " reforms to @entity186 in his speech , repeating proposals already raised in previous deficit - reduction negotiations that @entity13 consider insufficient			1
after arriving to loud cheers and prolonged applause on a night of political pomp and ceremony , @entity2 began the speech on a positive note , saying the nation was on sound footing to move forward			2
" together , we have cleared away the rubble of crisis , and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger , " he said			2
the president continued his push for @entity3 to act on politically volatile issues such as immigration reform			0
other measures in the speech included a paycheck fairness act intended to make it easier for women to fight salary discrimination without losing their jobs , and new proposals to develop alternative energy hubs in the country , and help people refinance their mortgages at today 's lower interest rates			0

@entity1 @entity98 : illegal border crossings at lowest levels in 40 years @entity2 mentioned @entity236 's latest underground nuclear test , which the @entity237 labeled " provocative " and " extremely regrettable			2
" with victims of gun violence in the audience at the @entity241 , including former @entity51 rep. @entity242 , @entity2 continued his push for tighter gun laws opposed by the influential @entity245 and legislators from both parties			1
he mentioned 15 - year - old @entity248 , the @entity250 girl killed by gun violence after returning home from taking part in inauguration activities in @entity0 , saying she was shot a mile from his home in the city			1
the girl 's parents were guests of first lady @entity191 at the address			0
also attending was former rock star @entity260 , a vocal critic of @entity2 and any efforts to strengthen gun controls in @entity51			2

listing gun violence victims -- @entity279 's parents , @entity242 , the families of the @entity42 schoolchildren and others killed in mass shootings , @entity2 said " they deserve a vote " as the audience cheered loudly			1
in his response , @entity72 sounded the @entity245 line that " unconstitutionally undermining the @entity286 rights of law - abiding @entity51 is not the way to " reduce gun violence in the country			1
on foreign policy , @entity2 announced that this time next year , another 34,000 @entity51 troops will have returned home from @entity295			2
the move will reduce by more than half the current force level of 66,000 troops in @entity295			0

one thing @entity2 did n't mention tuesday night was new regulations on carbon emissions for existing power plants a senior administration official said			2
environmentalists hoped the president 's pledge in his recent inaugural address for increased steps in response to climate change would include expanding tougher standards in place for new power plants to those already in existence			1
@entity1 @entity98 : wind energy breezes into the record books at the same time , the president promised executive action on climate change if @entity3 fails to address what he called a litany of evidence that the nation and the world face increasing impacts such as more frequent and powerful storms , wildfires and drought			0
one new measure from the president will be an executive order signed tuesday to address the country 's most basic cybersecurity needs			0
the order will make it easier for private companies in control of our nation 's critical infrastructure to share information about cyber attacks with the government			0
in return , the @entity354 will share " sanitized " classified information with companies about attacks believed to be occurring or that are about to take place			0
@entity3 has failed so far to pass any of the dozens of cybersecurity bills aimed at meaningfully securing critical infrastructure from an online criminals			0
@entity1 @entity98 : @entity2 on fuel economy -- your mileage may vary @entity72 is a tea party favorite being promoted as the new face of the @entity13 due to his @entity371 heritage and strong communications skills			1

@entity72 is leading an effort by some republicans to shift party policy on immigration reform by accepting the concept backed by @entity2 and @entity118 that the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants should have a path to legal status			1
