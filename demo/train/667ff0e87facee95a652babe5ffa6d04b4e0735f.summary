-- who says college kids have all the fun ? i 've spent spring breaks hunting for the " perfect " @entity6 on a @entity8 beach , watching major leaguers at spring training games , along with my little leaguers , and exploring the @entity12 with a couple of young hikers who were thrilled to become @entity15			1
so , if you think spring break is only for college kids , think again			1
while more college students opt to do volunteer work on their breaks ( and you can certainly find a family volunteer project , too ) families have discovered that it is easier -- and often cheaper -- to get away in the spring than in the summer when camps and summer jobs -- not to mention work schedules and peak travel season perils -- wreak havoc with family vacation planning			1
that 's why despite the recession you can expect to see parents and kids racing down ski slopes all around the country			1
in @entity39 , try a smaller , less expensive area like @entity41			1
@entity43 's @entity42 - at - @entity44 offers deep family discounts			1
kids can ski two days here for $ 30 and you get half - off a second kids ' ski lessons			1
or choose instead to cheer on your favorite teams at spring training games in @entity54 and @entity55			1
look for deals like at the @entity57 , which is close to @entity59 's @entity58			1
here you 'll save 25 percent on the best rate and get a " @entity61 , " which includes a baseball for signing , a box of @entity65 and a lot more			2
( the kids will love this ! ) in @entity55 , the historic @entity69 offers an overnight spring training escape package starting at just $ 219 , plus resort credits , while the @entity72 , a hip downtown property , promises the chance to mingle with the players at practice , suite accommodations , signed baseball gear and buy - one - get - one tickets -- as long as you can afford $ 1,000 per night			1
throughout march and april , look for deals in @entity81 like those at @entity84 's @entity83			1
@entity83 offers up to 35 percent off the room rate , which starts at just $ 260/night for a one - bedroom suite			2
or try the @entity87 ( look for kids up to 15 free deals available now at @entity90 as long as you book by march 1			1
) if sailing is more your style , share dinner with grandparents on mega cruise ships while happily comparing notes at what a great deal you scored			0
" in past years , many of these ships and categories would be sold out by now , " according to @entity103 from @entity104			0
she notes that while prices are up from last year , they still remain 10 percent lower than 2008 with especially good deals on the ultra deluxe liners			0
" there is great availability right now as consumers are waiting until the last minute to book , " she adds			0
you certainly do n't have to bust the budget either			0
take a short cruise , for example , from a port near your home ( @entity118 is launching @entity120 - themed cruises from @entity121 in late april ) or head to a ski resort touting free nights and lift tickets ( @entity126 , for example , in @entity128 gives two lift tickets for every room booked )			2
take the train ( kids travel at a deep discount on @entity134 ) and explore a nearby city			2
go with one child if the others have to stay home			0
go solo if your significant other ca n't get away			0
use the opportunity to try something new			2
learn to scuba dive or snowboard , explore a museum devoted to sport like the @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 , where basketball was first invented , or music ( the @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity152 , ) or spies ( the @entity154 in @entity155 )			1
so many families come to @entity157 for spring break -- 2.6 million visitors in march and april -- that you 'll see more kids here than at any other time of year , except summer			1
and it wo n't be nearly as hot			0
( check out the new @entity165 program and new @entity166 offers on everything from @entity169 attractions to accommodations and restaurants )			0
buy three nights and get two more free , including a week 's unlimited admission to @entity175 ' two parks where the much anticipated " @entity176 of @entity177 " will open later this spring -- less than $ 800 for two adults and two parents			1
you may even score free admission to see the mouse himself at @entity169 , if your family spends a day volunteering			0
look for hotel packages in @entity157 and elsewhere , especially for families			2
in honor of @entity191 in @entity157 , @entity54 's , first anniversary , for example , guests can score an upgrade to a two - bedroom villa , a $ 250 resort credit , lazy river tubes , mini golf and more			2
or you can avoid hotels entirely			0
one friend checks www.craigslist.com for apartment rentals in cities where she wants to visit and proposes what she 'd like to pay , typically scoring a deal -- at half the going rate , she boasted			0
also try sites like www.vrbo.com and www.homeaway.com where you can also negotiate directly with a homeowner or check out www.perfectfamilyvacation.com for good deals on digs in resort locales with multi-bedrooms			0
@entity215 has more than 100 hotels for under $ 100 per night			0
hotels are where the values are this spring with rates down 10 percent or more in destinations like @entity157 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity54 and @entity224 / @entity225 , reports @entity215 's @entity226			1
last spring break -- my daughter @entity230 's last before she went away to college -- i let her lead the way straight to @entity234 's @entity233 , about an hour from @entity235			1
we holed up in the @entity237 , a small , quaint hotel , and skied every day , traversing glaciers , viewing the @entity239 and stopping at traditional wooden huts for hearty lunches of homemade sausage and apple strudel			0
@entity230 , an avid skier , was thrilled by the mountains and by the fact that she could drink legally			0
i was thrilled to have her all to myself for a few days			0
" good bonding time , " she told me			0
exactly what a spring break should be -- wherever you go .			2
