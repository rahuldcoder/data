-- it 's often described as the game no team wants to play in			2
this was certainly the case for @entity6 saturday as the @entity8 hosts suffered further embarrassment after the @entity10 triumphed 3 - 0 in the third place playoff match in @entity12			1
chaotic defending helped the @entity15 race into an early lead with @entity17 scoring a penalty before @entity19 added a second soon after			1
@entity6 spent much of the second period looking for a way back into the game but despite a couple of dangerous looking free - kicks and a solid claim for a penalty of their own never looked like clawing back the deficit			1
a late strike by @entity29 added further gloss to the scoreline and piled even more misery on the @entity8 hosts			1
it 's a result that will doubtless further fuel the debate as to how the world 's most successful football nation overhauls the structure of its game after a calamitous end to its first home @entity8 in 64 years			1
as in tuesday 's 7 - 1 shellacking at the hands of @entity43 , a glaring lack of quality and organization shone through in the @entity47			1
@entity6 was once more out - maneuvered and out - thought by their well drilled opponents			1
@entity15 coach @entity51 takes a pride -- which he 's not shy of telling everyone about -- in preparing for every eventuality during a match , although he gave the impression that this fixture was not much of a concern to him ahead of the game			1
" there is only one award that counts and that is becoming world champions , " he had told reporters after losing to @entity62 in midweek			1
here , @entity67 made two changes to the side which started that semifinal			0
@entity71 came in for @entity72 in midfield and @entity74 replaced @entity75 who injured a hamstring in the warm - up			2
@entity6 too altered its personnel			1
captain @entity79 was restored to the center of defense after his suspension while @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 all came in to the side			0
it would make little difference			0
the shortcomings so ruthlessly exposed by @entity90 and co. in @entity92 were clear for all to see right from the off			0
@entity94 burst clear of the @entity6 defense in the first minute and was pulled back by @entity79 as he approached the box			1
the referee had little option despite contact beginning outside the area and pointed to the spot			0
he arguably should have sent @entity79 off for denying a clear goal - scoring opportunity but instead flashed only a yellow card , much to the frustration of @entity94			2
@entity105 stepped up and blasted the ball high beyond @entity107 in the @entity6 goal			1
@entity6 immediately began to press high looking to force a mistake that would let them back into the game , but in doing so left themselves exposed at the back			1
it was a tactic that when combined with yet more suicidal defending from @entity115 would lead to the @entity15 doubling their advantage after 17 minutes			1
a weak headed clearance from the former @entity119 defender fell at the feet of @entity121 who had what seemed like an age to take two touches to set himself before firing the ball beyond @entity107 with his third touch			0
@entity130 fans would have been forgiven for fearing the worst at this stage			0
but the five times world champions composed themselves as the match progressed			2
they had a penalty claim of their own turned down midway through the second half after @entity19 appeared to clear out @entity138 in the area			0
@entity141 's neat finish in the 90th minute , meanwhile , was one of the few clear shots on goal the @entity10 had in the second half			1
still , the gulf in class was obvious throughout and not what the world has come to expect from the land of @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			0
@entity156 and @entity79 aside , @entity6 have looked little more than average throughout the tournament , drawing on good fortune and favorable refereeing decisions to make it past decent but limited teams like @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
a physically robust approach , meanwhile , was deployed against more skilful teams like @entity168 and @entity169			0
as a result , few sides have committed as many fouls as @entity6			1
this is a particularly galling statistic for the once renowned samba kings , emphasizing the negative , spoiling nature of much of their play over the last four weeks			0
gone are the days , for now at least , of ball - playing midfielders who could flummox opponents and onlookers alike with their skill , style and mastery of the ball			2
instead , powerful players like @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity191 graft in the midfield engine room for the vintage of 2014			0
more technically adept talent like @entity195 , @entity196 and even @entity197 have been squeezed out of the team and the squad as a result			0
there might be plenty of muscle in this @entity6 side but at times the hosts also have seemed like a collective nervous wreck			2
tears have been shed during the playing of the anthem before games and after penalty shootouts			0
for the @entity10 , change is also afoot			2
@entity67 will depart to manage @entity214 team @entity213 and @entity215 will arrive to plot the path to the @entity217 in @entity218 2016			0
another group of fine young @entity15 players have made their tournament debuts in @entity6 as the old stagers like @entity105 , @entity94 , @entity223 and @entity75 have possibly played their last @entity8			1
the likes of @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity121 and @entity228 have all equipped themselves well			0
@entity19 , who is the son of the @entity15 assistant coach @entity229 , in particular looked mature and composed in both defense and attack before being carried off injured late on while @entity228 was again calm at the back			2
if only the future looked as rosy for @entity6			2
coach @entity234 will find out whether he will keep his job as coach as the post-mortem begins			0
" it is up to the president to decide , " @entity234 told reporters after the match , referring to the head of the @entity241			2
" we will hand in a final report and then leave it to him to analyze what needs to be done			0
" meanwhile , many of the players who performed so miserably in the latter stages will likely not play for their national team again			0
and yet , despite all this , the most painful result could be yet to come			0
@entity62 will face @entity43 sunday in the @entity253 in @entity254 to decide who will win this most entertaining of tournaments			1
should @entity6 's great @entity258 rivals triumph , this @entity8 could quite possibly top the famous @entity259 of 1950 in the annals of @entity130 sporting disasters .			1
