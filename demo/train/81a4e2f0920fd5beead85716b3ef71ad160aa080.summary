-- the @entity2 @entity1 has denied an appeal by @entity4 to block an $ 18 billion judgment against it in an @entity8 court			1
the high court gave no explanation behind its decision not to consider the appeal from the oil giant			0
the case , @entity4 v. @entity14 , stems from a 2011 injunction against enforcement of any judgments against the company related to lawsuits in @entity8			2
a judge initially granted the injunction , but in january of this year an appeals court reversed the lower court 's finding , removing the injunction			0
what the @entity1 announced on tuesday was that it would not consider @entity4 's appeal to reinstate the injunction			2
an @entity8 court had ruled that @entity4 must pay $ 8.6 billion in damages relating to a pollution lawsuit , an amount that increased to $ 18 billion because @entity4 did not apologize			1
in @entity8 , @entity4 has appealed to the country 's @entity35 , and in the @entity2 it sought to reinstate the injunction against enforcement of the @entity8 ruling			1
@entity4 noted the @entity1 ruling was not based on the merits of the case , and does not undo findings by another court that " fraud and bias have tainted the @entity8 proceedings and judgment			1
" " while @entity4 is disappointed that the court denied the petition , @entity4 will continue to defend against the plaintiffs ' lawyers ' attempts to enforce the fraudulent @entity8 judgment , " the company said on a blog it devotes to the case			1
@entity4 's legal fight in @entity8 involves litigation that goes back 19 years between residents of @entity8 's @entity61 and @entity62 , which was later purchased by @entity4			1
the pollution case stems from claims that the company had a detrimental impact on @entity67 communities where it operated			0
the company alleges that reports and evidence against it were fraudulent , and that bribes and corruption led to the original decision against it			0
that case , @entity76 v. @entity4 , was originally filed in @entity78 in 1993 on behalf of 30,000 inhabitants of @entity8 's @entity61			1
the suit was eventually transferred to the @entity8 court and @entity8 jurisdiction			2
the lawsuit alleges that @entity62 used a variety of substandard production practices in @entity8 that resulted in pollution that decimated several indigenous groups in the area , according to a fact sheet provided by the @entity90			0
according to the group , @entity62 dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into @entity90 waterways , abandoned more than 900 waste pits , burned millions of cubic meters of gases with no controls and spilled more than 17 million gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures			0
cancer and other health problems were reported at higher rates in the area , the group says			0
@entity4 says @entity62 was partnered with an @entity8 oil company when it operated in @entity8 , and that it spent $ 40 million on remediation efforts to clean up roughly one - third of the sites in which it worked -- an amount reflective of its 37 % share of the oil - producing consortium with @entity112			2
it says its cleanup efforts were certified and approved by the @entity8 government and blames @entity112 for any ongoing pollution at sites where it was the sole operator , according to documents on the @entity4 website regarding the lawsuit and its history of operations in the @entity124 country .			0
