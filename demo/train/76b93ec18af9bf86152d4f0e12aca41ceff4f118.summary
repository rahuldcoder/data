@entity1 , @entity0 -- a picture of an overweight woman lying naked on a couch , painted by @entity7 artist @entity6 , set a record tuesday night for the most money paid for a painting by a living artist			1
" @entity12 " depicts @entity12 lying on a worn - out couch			1
the 1995 life - size work , " @entity12 , " fetched $ 33.6 million during bidding at @entity17 's auction house in @entity18			1
the previous record was for " @entity20 , " a painting by @entity22 that sold for $ 23.5 million , said @entity23 , a spokesman for @entity17			1
" @entity12 " depicts @entity12 , a manager of a government - run job center in @entity1 , lying on her side on a worn - out couch with nothing to hide her folds of flesh			2
@entity17 's calls it a " bold and imposing example of the stark power of @entity6 's realism , " depicting " the forceful and undeniable physical presence of people and things			1
" @entity12 , 51 , said she was initially embarrassed to pose naked for the artist , but they soon grew comfortable in the studio -- so comfortable , in fact , that she confessed to falling asleep while posing			2
" i did n't mind if he noticed , " she said			0
the painting challenges modern notions of beauty and elicits a reaction from everyone who sees it			0
that may have been precisely the aim of @entity6 , who told @entity1 's @entity52 in 2002 that he wanted his paintings to " astonish , disturb , seduce , convince			2
" though some regard the painting as shocking -- ugly , even -- that is also the appeal for collectors , said @entity59 , editor of @entity60 in @entity1			0
" there 's a reaction against art that 's regarded as too pretty , " he said			0
@entity59 said he thinks a more conventionally beautiful painting would not be able to fetch such a large amount			0
" it 's the sort of thing that everyone immediately wants to voice an opinion about , " he said of the painting			0
" it challenges conventional taste ... and people do find that rather exciting and interesting to talk about			0
" collectors may also view this as a rare chance to buy something by a prolific artist painted at the peak of his work , he said			0
@entity6 , 85 , has been described as @entity7 's greatest living realist painter			1
he is the grandson of psychoanalyst @entity83 and came to @entity1 from @entity84 when he was a child			0
with @entity12 , @entity6 said he was " very aware of all kinds of spectacular things to do with her size , like amazing craters and things one 's never seen before , " according to the 2002 interview with the @entity52			1
he added , " i have perhaps a predilection towards people of unusual or strange proportions , which i do n't want to over-indulge			0
" @entity6 painted the portrait of @entity12 over nine months in 1995			1
@entity12 said she posed for eight hours a day , two or three days a week			2
she had been introduced to the artist through a mutual friend , @entity100 performance artist @entity99 , who also posed for @entity6			2
it was @entity99 's idea for @entity12 to pose for @entity6 , so he arranged a meeting			1
@entity12 knew the meeting was more of an interview for the job of @entity6 's muse , and she did n't find out until later -- through @entity99 -- that she 'd gotten the job , she said			1
" @entity6 just said to @entity99 , ' oh , tell @entity12 she can start next week , ' " @entity12 said			1
@entity12 still works full - time at the job center in @entity1 's @entity111 and calls her newfound fame " a bit bizarre			1
" she laughs as she describes how she now has to arrange her schedule to accommodate media interviews			0
she said she 's excited to find out how much the painting will sell for , but knowing that it could set a record is " a bit scary			2
" " it 's hard to put your head around it , really , " she said			0
" but it 's all good			0
