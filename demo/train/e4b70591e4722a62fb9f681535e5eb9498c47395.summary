@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's familiarity with guns , his marijuana use , and fights he may have been in can not be brought up in @entity9 's murder trial , the judge overseeing the case ruled tuesday			1
at the hearing two weeks before the scheduled start of the trial , judge @entity12 handed a series of victories to the prosecution when she barred the defense from introducing some information about @entity4			1
defense attorneys argued that some of the evidence could prove crucial in backing up @entity9 's claim of self - defense , depending on what the prosecution argues			1
certain evidence could ultimately be raised during the trial , however , if it is proven relevant and admissible based on what the prosecution presents , the judge decided			1
follow a live blog of tuesday 's hearing at @entity35 @entity36 left the door open on one issue involving marijuana			0
defense attorneys say toxicology tests show @entity4 had enough @entity42 -- the key active ingredient in marijuana -- in his system to indicate he may have smoked the drug a couple of hours before the shooting			2
@entity36 barred any mention of this from opening statements but said she will rule later on whether it will be admissible after she hears defense experts ' testimony about the marijuana use			0
marijuana use in general can come up during jury selection , the judge said			0
the attorneys also can not bring up @entity4 's text messages			1
the defense argued that texts from the day of the shooting show the teen was " hostile			0
" the judge also agreed to block previous text messages from @entity4 about drugs and a gun			1
@entity9 , who is out on bail , did not appear at the hearing			2
he 's charged with second - degree murder in the february 26 , 2012 , shooting			2
he was a neighborhood watch volunteer when he called 911 reporting " a suspicious person " in the neighborhood , who turned out to be 17 - year - old @entity4			2
the shooting put a national spotlight on @entity9 's hometown of @entity0 , @entity1 , and sparked fresh debates about race relations and gun laws			1
the decision not to bring charges against @entity9 led to the dismissal of the town 's police chief and the appointment of a special prosecutor , who accused the homeowner of unjustly profiling and killing @entity4			1
defense : state did n't turn over some evidence @entity36 did agree to one key request from the defense : to hold a hearing on whether the state failed to turn over some evidence			0
the defense called @entity98 , a former employee of the state attorney 's office , who said the prosecution did not turn over certain photos -- including one of a firearm in someone 's hand -- as well as some deleted text messages			1
@entity36 agreed to subpoena the state it investigator who allegedly issued a report about the photos and text messages			0
but she denied a defense request for a delay in the start of the trial , setting the start of jury selection for june 10			1
@entity36 also granted the prosecution 's motion to bar evidence about why it took so long to arrest @entity9			1
she denied a defense motion asking that the jury be taken to the crime scene and called it " disingenuous " in light of another defense motion requesting anonymity for the jury			0
the jurors will remain anonymous and will be referred to by their numbers only , she said			0
@entity36 set a hearing for friday on whether the media will be allowed to show their faces			0
gun , drug texts feature in new evidence judge to rule on screaming heard in 911 calls defense attorneys also raised questions tuesday about an analysis that suggests @entity4 might be heard screaming in the background of a 911 call just before the shooting			1
voice identification experts hired by the prosecution say that they do n't know for certain whose voice it is and that there is n't enough sound to make a conclusive determination			0
one analyst , @entity152 , said he believes @entity4 can be heard saying the word " stop			2
" @entity152 told the @entity154 that he believes the voice is @entity4 , but another analyst told the @entity154 that no determination can be made			2
defense attorneys said tuesday that in a deposition on friday , @entity152 said he had not completed his report and would need another two weeks			0
the defense does not want @entity152 's analysis admitted			0
judge @entity36 ruled that in a hearing at the end of next week , the science being used for voice identification will be discussed , and she will determine whether it is admissible at trial			2
if she approves the science as admissible , there 's still another barrier for either side to present witnesses using that science			0
once the trial begins , when either side wants to call a witness who conducted such an analysis , the judge will consider whether the scientist 's qualifications give him or her adequate expertise to weigh in			1
@entity9 will not seek ' stand your ground ' hearing no gold teeth while defense attorneys had argued in court papers that they may want other details about @entity4 admitted -- including an assertion that he had removable gold tooth caps -- they agreed tuesday that they do n't expect it to become relevant at trial			1
@entity36 ruled there will be no such mention in the trial			0
@entity200 , an attorney for @entity4 's family , previously lashed out against the defense for trying to get such details admitted			1
" is the defense trying to prove @entity4 deserved to be killed by @entity9 because ( of ) the way he looked ? " @entity200 asked in a statement			1
" if so , this stereotypical and closed - minded thinking is the same mindset that caused @entity9 to get out of his car and pursue @entity4 , an unarmed kid who he did n't know			1
" @entity9 's brother : drop murder charge after the hearing , @entity212 , brother of @entity9 , called on the state to drop the second - degree murder charge			1
" @entity9 lived in a community plagued by crime and was the first to come forward to help his neighbors , " he said			2
" @entity9 is a good , decent and honest man			2
it is now my honor to advocate for him			0
@entity9 is in the fight of his life quite literally			2
as the oldest son , the only right thing for me to do is deliver him back to our parents			0
the only right way to do it is by relying on truth			0
we are not a wealthy family but we are rich in honor			0
" authorities initially " did their job when they refused to charge someone with a crime who had committed no crime , " @entity212 said			0
" in this country , you do n't charge someone with any crime solely to assuage the concerns of misinformed masses			0
" @entity247 , another attorney for the @entity4 family , praised tuesday 's hearing			1
" without question , today was a very important day in this case , " he said			1
" what was rather clear : all of the bad information put out by the defense team will not be evidence in this case , " @entity247 added			2
