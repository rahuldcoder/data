-- a few months ago , after drinking scorpion shots with @entity4 ' ceo @entity3 , he gave me a tour of the @entity7 , a formerly blighted neighborhood in @entity9 being revitalized			1
@entity3 and others are investing $ 350 million to help turn the desert town into the smartest city in the world			0
sound ambitious ? it is			0
@entity3 's interest in cities strikes many people as a curiosity , given his track record at @entity4			1
talk to him ( especially over scorpion shots ) , and you find out it 's actually the reverse			0
" every time the size of a city doubles , innovation per person increases , but when a company gets bigger , innovation per person goes down			1
why is that ? " he asked			0
" in a city , " he explained , " people and businesses are self - organizing			0
we 're trying to do the same thing at @entity4			1
" part of that goal involves moving @entity4 to holacracy -- an organizational system that throws out all job descriptions , job titles , management ( as we know it ) , and the organization chart , and starts over			1
since @entity4 ' announced this move , people have wondered whether holacracy is just another fad or something to be taken seriously			1
let 's take a closer look at holacracy			0
( full disclosure : i endorsed @entity3 's book " @entity55 , " and he wrote the preface for my book , " tribal leadership			0
" he 's spoken to my @entity61 classes , and i 've spoken at several @entity4 events			1
) you should care about holacracy because it tries to fix many things we all hate about companies , including : 1			1
the organization chart on the wall has nothing to do with how people do their jobs			0
the title you have probably does n't reflect what you do , unless you own the company			1
your manager knows nothing about what you do much of the time , and yet makes decisions that determine your success			0
traditional management creates " my life sucks " cultures			0
if any of these problems sound familiar , then you and @entity3 ( and many of us in the leadership world ) are on the same page , so far at least			0
@entity92 was pioneered by @entity93 and outlined in his upcoming book , " @entity92 : @entity95			1
" the basic building block is a role , which is a breakdown of the organization 's work			2
roles work together in " circles " that self - organize			2
circles can spawn sub-circles , and connect with other circles with " links " â € ” roles that form conduits between circles			0
people " energize " roles , and one person can energize multiple roles			2
circles have regular governance meetings in which people talk about roles , accountabilities , authority and policies			0
if this description ( which i ran by @entity93 word - for - word ) sounds like he 's been reading the rules of @entity123 translated into computer code by way of @entity126 , you 're not far off			0
@entity92 is complex , and designed to be so			1
it is hard to implement			0
to date , @entity4 is by far the largest adopter of holacracy			1
when it works , holacracy is amazing , so it 's no wonder business leaders are paying attention			0
@entity133 , author of " @entity134 " and founder of a consulting and training company that runs on holacracy , told me that after a tough adjustment period : " the company becomes much like a well - tuned machine that , to some degree , is self - correcting			2
you do n't have to spend a lot of time going through channels to get things handled			2
" so , will it work at @entity4 ? probably			1
@entity92 requires a great culture , and people who value egalitarianism			1
it 's not communism ( despite what some critics are saying ) , but it does throw out conventional ideas of power and hierarchy			2
it helps if people are grounded in customer service , can tolerate weirdness , and can take a leap of faith into the unknown			0
if this description is n't your company , then holacracy will not be a great fit			2
@entity92 is not coming to a company near you , at least not in its current form			1
few have the value set of @entity4 and very few have great cultures			1
it remains to be seen whether it can scale to a company of @entity4 ' size			1
the real story here is that there are many new organizational forms out there , holacracy being one			2
most emphasize ownership thinking , agile methods and great cultures			0
like cell phones in the 1980s , these new organizational models are big , bulky and hard to use			2
many do n't work at all			0
but over time , some of them will become sleek , easy to use , more powerful , and even elegant			0
@entity92 may just surprise us			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

@entity4 is trying out holacacy , an organizational system that does away with hierarchy
@entity203 : @entity92 tries to fix many things we all hate about companies
he says as a company gets larger , innovation per person tends to go down
@entity197 : @entity92 might just work at @entity4 because of its unique culture
