@entity0 , @entity1 -- when my neighbor @entity4 got on a @entity0 ferry tuesday , she did something she 'd never done before with her three young children : she put on life preservers			1
" i wanted to show them how to get one out and put one on , " said @entity4 , whose three children -- @entity14 , 10 , @entity15 , 9 , and 7 - year - old @entity16 -- are playmates with my son 4 - year - old son , @entity19 , in @entity20 , a small village of a few dozen families on @entity0 , one of hundreds of islands that make up @entity1			1
our village was awoken by the sound of helicopters monday night , as searchlights trained on the sea until the sunlight broke the next morning on a capsized boat just a few hundred meters offshore			0
the ferry collision that left at least 38 dead -- including five children -- is not an abstraction for those who live on @entity0 , but a tragedy that puts the spotlight on an elemental part of our lives and the economic livelihood of @entity1 : the busy waterways and the boats that connect the city			1
the fortunes of @entity1 were built on its deep - water ports , and its seas are still among the hardest working waters in the world			1
the city had the third highest container ship traffic in the world in 2008 , according to the @entity56			2
about 135,600 passengers take local ferry services daily across @entity60 from @entity61 to @entity62 and outlying islands such as @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity0 , government records say			1
it 's common for the ferries to stop and pivot around cargo - carrying behemoths that churn through the @entity70 , buffeting the ferry with big waves before we continue on our way			1
as a daily commuter it 's now a wonder to me that tragedies like monday 's collision do n't happen more often given the volume of traffic			1
@entity1 seas are like " @entity85 at rush hour ... it 's an extremely complicated harbor , " retired marine accident investigator @entity83 told @entity2			1
@entity0 life " the ferry from @entity1 to @entity0 must be one of the most delightful commuter runs in the world , " a 2000 @entity90 piece on tourist spots in @entity1 reads			1
the roughly 5,000 residents of @entity0 -- about one third of them expatriates , according to the government -- are drawn to the largely rural island for the peaceful counterpoint it offers to working among the skyscrapers in this bustling city of 7 million			1
there are no cars and no residences higher than three stories on the island			0
we prefer birdsong at dawn rather than jackhammers , and charting our life according to the ferry schedule is the price we pay ( that , and the occasional exotic pest , such as the @entity119 cobra that found its way into my home two years ago )			2
but life on @entity0 is defined by the ferries			2
about two - thirds of the island departs each day on ferries to attend school and work , according to government statistics			2
the ferries create a strange familiarity , people i think of as " ferry phantoms " -- strangers whose faces you know only from sharing the @entity0 ferries -- and yet when your paths cross in the city , your instinct is to wave hello			1
the ferries are a great equalizer : i once shared a ferry ride with @entity0 's most famous son , @entity146 , the star of movie blockbuster " @entity149 , " who grew up on the island and frequently comes back for charity events			1
no matter your wealth , job or status , the ferry is your only ride here			0
so the degrees of separation from the tragedy are few to @entity0 residents			0
the ships involved are known to us			0
there is n't a resident of @entity164 , the largest town on this island , who has n't ridden the @entity167 , the catamaran vessel operated by the @entity1 and @entity169			2
the @entity0 , the ship that sank , was a common sight among the vessels that take workers daily to the @entity1 electric power plant on the island			1
inside a few hours , a parent from my son 's preschool had posted a second - hand account on @entity180 describing " a sudden crash " and water flushing through a " big hole " in the boat			0
" there was panic , " the message said			0
my friend and bandmate @entity188 was on the @entity167 when it hit , throwing him to the floor			0
the boat listed as it took on water and when he looked out , he said the prow of the @entity0 moved up into the air " like the @entity197			2
" more : survivors recount chaos , horror of ferry collision questions remain the questions we have are the same as many , asking how it happened and grumblings about whether the ferry companies are doing enough to protect our safety			0
when my neighbor , @entity211 , gave her children a life jacket demonstration , she was admonished by the ferry staff , she said			0
the crews of both boats have since been arrested and @entity1 chief executive @entity218 has promised a thorough investigation			0
but for the families on @entity0 , the unease continues			0
my 4 - year - old son is asking about the ferry crash , and on tuesday implored me not to get onto the boat to go to work			0
this morning , as the families of @entity228 gathered at the ferry pier at 6:50 a.m. local time for the commute to work and school , eyes kept moving to the spot offshore where yesterday the wreck of the @entity0 stood dramatically out of the water			2
but for us , the memory of the 38 souls who lost their lives will be forever etched on that patch of sea -- a reminder of the daily trust we place in the hands of those who carry us across the water , and the horrible consequences when that trust is misplaced .			0

the tragic boat collision that *killed* 38 people has *rocked* the island *community* of @entity0
the island is home to about 5,000 people a half hour ferry ride from @entity61
the waters around @entity1 have some of the busiest boat traffic in the world
ferries carry 135,600 people each day around @entity1 's major islands
