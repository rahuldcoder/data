-- throughout high school , @entity1 felt ashamed about being overweight			1
it was n't just his hefty size that depressed him , but the distance he felt growing between him and some of his closest friends			2
over four years , he watched as his friends steadily left him out of conversations , gave him the cold shoulder at school , and then started excluding him altogether from their friday night outings around @entity14 , @entity15			2
he was crushed , spending many evenings alone , feeling rejected			2
standing at 5 feet 7 inches , @entity1 hit his peak weight at 405 pounds when he was 19			1
" i would go home and ask my mom why this was happening to me , but i knew it was because of my weight , " he said			1
" when i would go out with my mom to pick up groceries or shopping , i would wait in the car because i was so embarrassed			2
" when he started @entity26 , he continued to struggle with those feelings			2
" i was having suicidal thoughts because of my weight			1
i even wrote a letter about it that my mom found , and she broke down crying , " he said			1
" i was tired of everything , tired of people laughing at me , tired of being overweight , tired of being treated differently , " he said			1
" i thought about committing suicide , but i did n't want to leave my mother by herself			2
" after discovering the letter in his bedroom , his mom said she knew something had to change			2
" i saw how depressed he was getting , and that 's what hurt me the most , " said his mother , @entity39			1
but she was not going to let him struggle on his own			2
she had recently lost more than 100 pounds after a scare from her cardiologist who said she was on the verge of having a heart attack because of her weight			1
that experience made her believe her son could lose the weight , too			1
" he was a junk - aholic , as i was			2
he had a sweet tooth			2
he was a snacker -- cakes , cookies , soda , chips , " she said			2
she was convinced that all her son needed was some guidance about moderation			0
but @entity1 just wanted the weight off			1
he came to her after many tearful nights and asked if he could get gastric bypass surgery			1
" i needed a change , " he said			0
as an employee at @entity71 's call center , his mother knew about the school 's wellness program @entity72 , which offers a 12 - month weight - loss program for employees and their family members			1
she wanted her son to lose weight , but she also wanted him to try natural methods before committing to surgery			1
so she made him a proposition : enroll in the program and try to lose weight naturally for the first few months			1
if that method failed , they would consider surgery			1
when he started in the program in july 2011 , his goal was to lose 40 pounds to qualify for gastric bypass surgery			1
at the start of the program , he was paired with a coach and a dietitian			0
@entity92 , a registered nurse and dietitian , helped him devise a plan to meet his weight - loss goals , which included cutting back on sweetened beverages , eating more fruits and vegetables , and being mindful of portion sizes			1
he regimented his diet , eating three meals a day and two healthy snacks in between his meals			0
@entity92 also encouraged @entity1 to get a gym membership			1
@entity1 had never worked out			1
he had played a few pickup games of basketball in middle school , but it was never strenuous			0
he was nervous and excited for the new experience , but a part of him was sure it was n't going to work			0
he held on to the hope that if he lost just a few pounds , it would be enough to convince his mom that he could do the gastric bypass surgery			1
as @entity1 started working out on the elliptical machine , walking on the treadmill and eating smaller portions , he saw big changes quickly			1
in the first week , he lost seven pounds			1
after a few weeks , he started walking 45 to 50 minutes every day on the treadmill with the incline set to high , at a speed that was almost a jog			0
after three months , he had dropped 40 pounds , and the urge to have surgery also dissipated			1
he was now spending two hours a day at the gym			0
" he became a changed person , " @entity92 said			0
he was like , ' i can do this			0
' i think that is so important for people , to have that confidence that they can succeed			0
" the salty and sweet snacks were traded in for healthy meals such as grilled chicken and brown rice for lunch and mostly grilled vegetables for dinner			0
@entity1 re-evaluated the way he approached food , choosing items such as whole grains and lean proteins to sustain his workouts , not high - calorie sweets to satisfy his cravings			1
" he just had to go to someone who could say , ' you can eat what you want , but in moderation , ' " his mother said			0
after completing the program in december 2012 , @entity1 was down to 280 pounds -- a loss of 125 pounds			1
but he wanted to be leaner			0
he started lifting weights on his own			0
whenever he came across a piece of gym equipment he was unsure about , he asked a gym staff member to show him how to use it			0
he discovered he liked lifting weights			0
" i liked the leg press			0
i never tried it , and i learned it works out your hamstrings and quads			0
when i starting incorporating it into my workouts , i saw improvements in my thighs , " he said			0
the added resistance helped him drop another 100 pounds within a year			1
in two years , he had managed to bring his weight down to 180 pounds , exceeding all his weight - loss expectations			1
now , happy with his weight , he continues to work out every day			1
he focuses on building muscle , not losing weight			1
he does cardio for 15 to 20 minutes and then puts energy toward sculpting his muscles by lifting weights and changing his fitness routine			0
the 23 - year - old even has a job that requires him to be fit			0
he works at a @entity184 warehouse and is on his feet lifting heavy boxes several hours a day			0
" if i did n't lose weight , i would n't be able to do this job , " he said			2
" there are people who work with me who look like they are fit , but they ca n't lift like i can			0
it really makes me want to keep staying in shape			0
" and his social life ? it took a dramatic turn for the better			0
he has new friends , and a few old ones who stuck by him while he was struggling with his weight			2
they get together weekly as a group and hang out			0
sometimes , he even runs into old classmates who shunned him when he was overweight			2
" now they ( say ) they are proud of me for losing weight , and that i am an inspiration , " he said			2
after losing 225 pounds , he said the biggest lesson he learned was not to lose sight of who he was under all that weight			1
" your life will change , but you do n't have to change , " he said			0
" you can look at things differently , but do n't change who you are just because you changed physically			0
... remember who was there for you and who stayed with you			0

at 405 pounds , @entity1 says he was *extremely* lonely
tired of being overweight , he considered gastric bypass surgery
he lost the weight naturally and says he 's found happiness
