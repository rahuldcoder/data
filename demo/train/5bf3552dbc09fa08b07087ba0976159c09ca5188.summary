-- the winter storm system that walloped the @entity2 moved east friday night , bringing with it not just snow but powerful winds -- all of which made travel perilous and last - minute @entity9 shopping more complicated across several states			1
earlier this week , blizzard - like conditions left many locales white less than a week before the holiday			1
many communities in central @entity16 , for instance , got about a foot of snow , and the city of @entity20 , @entity21 , got 15.2 inches wednesday and thursday , according to the @entity22			1
this much snow generally is n't expected as the system moves east , hitting @entity25 , @entity26 and upstate @entity27			1
but that does n't mean there have n't been -- and wo n't still be -- plenty of headaches			0
@entity31 is hardly foreign to these areas			0
but the addition of strong winds , especially in mountainous areas and along the @entity36 , makes staying on snow - slickened roads even harder			2
" it 's scary , " @entity38 told @entity0 affiliate @entity39 , soon after her car slid into a ditch friday in western @entity25			2
" i guess i was just driving too fast , and you should slow down a lot sooner			0
" the lone blizzard warning , in effect friday night through 6 p.m. saturday , was for parts of northern @entity49 and north - central @entity50			1
the @entity22 predicts 8 to 12 inches of snow and sustained winds of up to 35 mph , with gusts blowing up to 60 mph			2
" strong winds will cause blowing and drifting of snow with blizzard conditions expected at times with visibilities of one quarter mile or less ( and ) wind chill temperatures in the single digits ... also possible , " the agency 's forecast said			1
" downed trees and power lines could result from the strongest gusts on saturday			0
" more populated areas -- many of which , such as @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity26 , were seeing snow around 9 p.m. friday -- are also expected to be hit hard			1
the latter two cities are among those facing a winter storm warning through 7 p.m. saturday			2
the weather service 's forecast calls for 5 to 7 inches of snow , with 10 inches possible in spots , plus regular winds approaching 30 mph and up to 45 - mph gusts by @entity71			2
a similar warning applies to western @entity26 , where 5 to 9 inches of light to moderate snow -- some of it " heavier , lake - enhanced snow " -- and gusts as strong as 40 mph are expected			1
even more snow , between 10 to 18 inches , is forecast farther south in @entity26 and in northern @entity50 , with 50 - mph gusts possible			1
" a winter storm warning means that snow will make travel dangerous , " the weather service said			1
" if you must venture out at all , use extreme caution			0
" these advisories follow severe weather farther west that caused major problems earlier this week			0
while the city itself was largely spared of snow , @entity104 's two airports -- @entity105 and @entity106 -- were clogged with travelers due to flight cancellations			0
blinding snow is blamed for a 30 - car pileup on @entity111 near @entity112 , @entity16 , that killed two people , said @entity115 sgt. @entity114			0
it was one of close to 100 weather - related accidents reported around the state by thursday morning , according to @entity114			0
@entity0 's @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
