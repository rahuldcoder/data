@entity0 , @entity1 -- in 17 years working at @entity2 i 've worked on countless breaking news stories , from earthquakes and hurricanes to the 2011 tsunami that devastated @entity8			1
but nothing prepared me for what i 've seen in the past few days in my own country -- the @entity1			1
as @entity12 weaved its destructive path across the east of the country more than a week ago , i was drafted in to help with our coverage as the network scrambled into action			1
it had only been nine months since i 'd left my newsroom job in the @entity23 to join our corporate offices in @entity25 , but i quickly found myself in the city of @entity0 , one of the hardest hit areas , with my @entity2 colleagues			1
i am not used to being in the field , so to deal with this difficult assignment in my own backyard , i had to shut down			1
offering all they have we wasted no time			1
we walked to a village nearby where we met @entity36			1
he was gathered with two of his friends in a shack , not far from the city 's battered airport			1
@entity36 looked at me with a smile and asked , " have you eaten yet ? come eat ! " i was astonished that his first words to me were to find out if i was hungry -- despite all that was happening around us			1
@entity36 and his friends were squatting under a few pieces of overlapping corrugated metal sheets reinforced only by broken tree trunks and pieces of wood			1
they had little to offer as they 'd lost everything			2
a bowl of rice and a pot of boiled noodles was all they could muster on their makeshift table			2
but that 's @entity1 hospitality			1
even at our lowest moments we offer all that we have			2
@entity36 proceeded to tell us his story			2
he was very matter of fact			2
" my wife and daughter died in the storm , " he said			1
he pointed behind to where their remains still lay			2
in a gentle tone he added , " i just want to know where their bodies will be taken so i can light a candle for them			2
that was his only request			2
@entity36 looked at me again and smiled			2
he repeated his invitation , " come eat ! " when it started to rain again i looked around me			2
there was not a single house left standing			0
there was nowhere to seek shelter			0
the entire area was completely flattened and littered with debris and the occasional body of another tragic victim			0
i could n't imagine how people managed to survive day after day , night after night			0
people lined up in droves at the airport to get out of typhoon - ravaged @entity0			0
one woman told me , " i have nothing left here			0
there is nothing left here			0
" but others chose to stay behind			1
some did not have a choice			0
' @entity105 ' shock many of those we talked to said they thought it was just another storm -- the usual heavy rainfall and strong winds they were so used to			1
but it was the unexpected storm surge that destroyed and killed			1
some called it a tsunami			0
one woman told us the water went as high as a five - meter tree			0
whispering in short phrases , she described how the water rose quickly and swept her four - month - old baby and her three - year - old from her arms			0
i 'm a mother too and thought about my own children			0
i could not wait to hold them in my arms			0
everyone had a story to tell : the little girl who waited patiently with her mother at the airport , the young mother who lost her husband , six children , mother and siblings			0
and then there was the man who wanted to end his life because his beloved wife and two daughters died in the storm			1
courage but amid the widespread grief and despair , it was the extraordinary courage of my fellow @entity1 in @entity0 that struck me most			1
on our final day in @entity0 , i saw a group of people walking back to town			0
a man looked up to the sky and asked out loud , " how much longer ? how much longer ? " i wished i had an answer for him			0
there was little i could do , little that i could give			0
i only had some cereal bars and crackers in my backpack that i gave away to people at the airport before i got on a plane back to @entity164			0
i eventually arrived back in the capital to numerous emails , texts , and messages on my cellphone and on my @entity171 page from family and friends			0
i was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support , their willingness to help			0
i was seeing first - hand how my fellow @entity1 were coming together before my eyes -- organizing and volunteering			1
i have lived overseas for almost two decades but my return to the @entity1 allowed me to witness @entity1 at their worst and best			1
the @entity1 spirit is alive among us			1
@entity183 's desperate bid to find family amphibious ships join relief effort golfer @entity187 loses eight relatives			0

an expat @entity1 , @entity190 returned to her *native* land after @entity12
" to deal with this difficult assignment in my own backyard , i had to shut down . "
she was struck by the *resilience* of her countrymen despite the *challenges*
many chose not to heed *warnings* to *evacuate* , thinking the storm would not be as severe
