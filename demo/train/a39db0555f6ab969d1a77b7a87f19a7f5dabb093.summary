@entity0 -- the @entity2 is " running out of time " to win the war in @entity9 , and sending in more troops will not guarantee victory , the chairman of the @entity5 , adm. @entity4 , warned @entity6 on wednesday			1
adm. @entity4 tells a congressional committee wednesday that the war in @entity9 is winnable			1
at the same hearing , defense secretary @entity12 said the conflict in @entity15 has entered the " endgame " but said that the situation there remains fragile and that @entity2 decisions in the coming months " will be critical to regional stability and our national security interests in the years to come			1
" @entity4 's and @entity12 ' remarks to the @entity24 came a day after president @entity25 announced troop reductions in @entity15 and the deployment of 4,500 additional troops in @entity9			1
@entity4 said he is convinced the @entity9 war can be won but said the @entity2 urgently needs to improve its nation - building initiatives and its cross-border strategy with @entity31			1
" we ca n't kill our way to victory , and no armed force anywhere -- no matter how good -- can deliver these keys alone			1
it requires teamwork and cooperation , " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 appeared before the @entity24 panel a day before the seventh anniversary of the september 11 attacks , which prompted the @entity2 - led invasion of @entity9			1
militants have re-established their presence in @entity9 after @entity2 and @entity48 troops entered the country in october 2001 and ousted the @entity51 government , which was harboring @entity52 , the terrorist group behind the september 11 attacks			1
and @entity4 said these militants have grown " bolder			1
" cross-border attacks into @entity9 by militants in @entity31 's tribal region are a problem , and the @entity2 has deployed predator drones to attack targets in @entity31			1
last week , @entity2 troops entered @entity31 , a move that prompted condemnation from @entity61			0
@entity4 stressed that @entity9 ca n't be referenced without " speaking of @entity31 , " where , he said , the militant groups collaborate and communicate better , launch more sophisticated attacks , employ foreign fighters and use civilians as human shields			1
" in my view , these two nations are inextricably linked in a common insurgency that crosses the border between them , " he said , adding that he plans " to commission a new , more comprehensive strategy for the region , one that covers both sides of the border			0
" i have pressed hard on my counterparts in @entity31 to do more against extremists and to let us do more to help them , " he said			0
the conflict is exacerbated , he said , by the " poor and struggling @entity9 economy " as well as the drug trade and " significant political uncertainty in @entity31			2
" these factors present a " complex , difficult struggle			0
" @entity4 said that he has urged the " growth and training " of @entity9 forces and that @entity2 military officials recommend the deployment of a @entity90 battalion this fall and another @entity92 unit early next year , which @entity25 announced tuesday			1
@entity25 also announced that about 8,000 @entity2 troops soon will be coming home from @entity15 , and @entity12 told the committee wednesday that the " continuing drawdown is possible because of the success in reducing violence and building @entity15 security capacity			1
" the @entity2 probably will remain in @entity15 for years in roles that will change and become more limited over time , he said			2
" even with fewer @entity2 troops in @entity15 , the positive trends of the last year have held and in some cases steadily continued in the right direction , " @entity12 said			2
" our casualties have been greatly reduced -- even though one is too many -- and overall violence is down			0
" rep. @entity112 , @entity113 , the committee 's chairman , asked whether @entity15 remains the higher priority			2
the defense secretary said he does n't think importance can be conveyed in a " mathematical equation			1
" " i would say success in @entity15 means we are steadily reducing our commitment -- our level of commitment and resources , particularly manpower -- for that theater , " @entity12 said			2
" at the same time we are able , under those circumstances , to increase our level of commitment and resources to @entity9			2
" @entity4 said both conflicts are high priorities			2
as for @entity9 , the imminent deployments are not enough for now , but they represent " a good start , " @entity4 said			1
there are more than 30,000 @entity2 troops under coalition and @entity137 commands in @entity9			2
" frankly , i judge the risk of not sending them too great a risk to ignore			0
my expectation is that they will need to perform both the training mission and combat and combat support missions simultaneously until such time that we can provide additional troops			0
i can not at this point say when that might be , " he said			0
he said he 's confident that @entity9 security forces can be trained and developed			0
" in fact , they are on track to reach a total end strength of 162,000 troops by 2010			0
the @entity90 conducting their training are doing a phenomenal job , " he said			0
at the same time , @entity4 warned " that no amount of troops in no amount of time can ever achieve all the objectives we seek			0
" until @entity9 security forces gain the backing of local leaders to improve security , " we will only be as much as a crutch , and a temporary one at that , " the admiral said			0
" we can hunt down and kill extremists as they cross over the border from @entity31 , as i watched us do during a daylong trip to the @entity175 in july			0
but until we work more closely with the @entity31 government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate , the enemy will only keep coming , " he said			0
@entity4 also said roads , schools and courts can be built and repaired , but that work is not enough , either			0
@entity9 needs more experts in commerce , agriculture , jurisprudence and education			0
the nation also needs " foreign investment , alternative crops , sound governance and the rule of law			1
" until then , @entity4 said , these institutions " will remain but empty shells			0
