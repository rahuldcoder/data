as @entity4 prepares to try two children as adults in an attempted murder case allegedly inspired by the mythical @entity8 , the prosecution of two preteens in adult court challenges our faith in the juvenile justice system			1
the entire juvenile justice system is premised upon one bedrock principle			1
it 's an immutable fact that our parents and forebears have known for millennia , and it 's something that science is increasingly backing up : juveniles are different			1
they say the darndest things			1
i believe children are our future ; teach them well and let them see the way			1
show them all the beauty -- well , everything @entity31 said in that song , you get the point			1
the point is , this is why we have a juvenile justice system in the first place			1
not only are children developmentally different , but even the @entity39 has long recognized that they are also constitutionally different			1
as recognized by justice @entity42 in a recent court opinion , a child 's immaturity leads to recklessness , impulsiveness , and risky behavior			1
children are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures both from lousy family members and from ne'er - do - well peers			1
they have limited control over their environment and lack the capacity to extricate themselves from bad situations			1
the flipside to all this is that because a child 's character is not as fixed as an adult 's , bad behavior is not necessarily indicative of irretrievable depravity			1
children are redeemable because they may simply " grow out " of their bad behavior			1
the bottom line , according to the court , is that these differences diminish the traditional penological justifications for harsh punishment of juveniles -- even when they commit the most horrific crimes			2
the juvenile justice system is different because kids are different			2
modern science agrees , providing biological explanations for juvenile delinquency : " the most noteworthy features of adolescent brain development relate to changes occurring within the brain 's frontal lobes -- in particular the prefrontal cortex -- and in the connections between the prefrontal cortex and other brain structures			2
these areas and interconnections are critical to ' executive ' functions such as planning , motivation , judgment , and decisionmaking , including the evaluation of future consequences , the weighing of risk and reward , the perception and control of emotions , and the processing and inhibition of impulses , " the @entity86 , the @entity87 and the @entity88 wrote in a friend - of - the - court brief filed with the @entity39 in 2012			1
this research -- plus our firmly entrenched notions about juvenile responsibility -- have informed the operation of our juvenile justice system since its inception			2
instead of punishment and incarceration , the juvenile system focuses on treatment and rehabilitation			2
at least that 's the theory			2
but how is it executed ? typically , a juvenile court can send a child to a secure educational facility instead of prison , and juvenile courts generally lose jurisdiction over children at a statutory age -- usually anywhere from 21 to 25			1
their juvenile records are customarily sealed and not public like adult criminal records			2
the idea is this : once you are an adult , you get a fresh start			2
after all , your childish behavior is now behind you			0
unless -- well , unless what you did was really , really , really bad			0
in that case ? you 're going to prison at @entity141 with the rest of the adults			0
although all states differ , the general rule is this : juvenile court has jurisdiction over a child unless he or she is alleged to have committed something awful , like murder or attempted murder , and then the case is automatically ( or at the discretion of the court or prosecutor ) placed in adult court , where the child is subject to adult penalties			0
but what happened to all that " prefrontal cortex " talk and the @entity39 , and " children are fundamentally different " ? apparently , children are different -- but if they really make us angry , they can go be different in prison			1
we treat children according to their developmental culpability , with a colossal exception : if the consequences of their behavior are really serious , we instead deal with them according to the outcome -- even though the biological genesis of that behavior remains exactly the same			1
if a child punches an adult , the child may land in juvenile court			0
if a child punches an adult , and that adult falls and dies , then the child might be in adult court			0
same root causes of bad behavior , different judicial outcome			0
the neurology remains the same in all cases , but we inconsistently demand disparate treatment			0
why the judicial hypocrisy ? it 's as if society is saying it acknowledges all the science about adolescent brain development and is fine with it as long as we 're talking about crimes like spray - painting cars , smoking pot , or a fistfight at school			0
but for those most egregious crimes like murder , the scientific mumbo jumbo goes out the window			0
when kids kill , society wants retribution			0
maybe it 's just legislative recognition of what we ultimately believe : sure , child development has as a general rule that kids are redeemable , but there are exceptions to every rule			0
some kids are just bad to the bone -- they are trouble , and they will always be trouble			0
and if your mind just wandered to a specific kid in your neighborhood , maybe you agree with that concept			0
but there 's probably one notable exception : your own kid			0
your little snowflake is really a good kid and would never do anything wrong			0
when it comes to the juvenile system , we should address the inconsistency ; it borders on hypocrisy			0
if we agree the juvenile mind is less culpable , we should treat it that way , without exception .			0
