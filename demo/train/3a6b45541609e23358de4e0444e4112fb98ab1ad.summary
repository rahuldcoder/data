editor 's note : saturday marks one year since @entity3 ' defeat of @entity4 in the fierce struggle for control of @entity7			1
@entity9 correspondent @entity8 has been covering the region for over 15 years			1
he reports from @entity7 on daily life and reality over the past year in this fractious land			1
@entity9 's @entity8 reports on the past year in @entity7 , where people are safer but out of food , gas , and patience			1
@entity18 , @entity7 ( @entity9 ) -- " if you take pictures , i 'll kill you ! i 'll kill you ! " screamed a masked @entity4 gunman , pointing his @entity23 assault rifle at my cameraman , @entity24			1
" calm down ! calm down ! " i shouted back at him , turning to @entity24 to tell him to put the camera down			0
@entity24 and i had ducked into a fruit and vegetable shop in @entity18			0
we had been covering the funeral of a @entity4 gunman killed in a clash with @entity3 rivals when our third gunbattle of the day had broken out			1
the gunman left , much to everyone 's relief , and i put my small video camera on the floor and pressed the button to record the constant roar of machine gun fire , which went on for more than half an hour			2
earlier in the day , @entity24 and i were on a street corner videotaping @entity3 militiamen when a jeep full of @entity4 irregulars opened fire , just down the street from an elementary school			1
as guns blazed , schoolchildren ran for cover			0
i watched as shopkeeper @entity55 slammed shut the doors of his grocery store , the expression on his face one of fear and utter exasperation			2
" i 'm going home , " he told me			0
it 's never been this bad			2
" it was violence like this , which we witnessed on december 2006 , that reached a climax in the second week of june 2007			2
when it ended on june 14 , 2007 , with @entity3 roundly defeating @entity4 , @entity7 went quiet			1
and quiet -- relative quiet , that is -- has been @entity3 ' biggest accomplishment since			1
no longer do you worry about being kidnapped			0
gunbattles , though they can happen , are much less common			2
after last june 's takeover ( or coup d'etat , as @entity4 supporters call it ) , @entity3 quickly imposed law and order , tried to reacquaint @entity7 's drivers with long - forgotten traffic regulations , launched a municipal cleanup campaign , and forced the release of kidnapped @entity84 journalist @entity83 , who had been held in captivity for almost six months			1
chaos - weary @entity86 applauded all of these initiatives			1
but the honeymoon ended quickly as reality sank in			0
since @entity3 won parliamentary elections in january 2006 , and even more so since last year 's takeover , @entity91 has tightened its siege of @entity7			1
@entity91 has restricted supplies of gasoline , diesel and electricity to @entity7 , limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip , and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in @entity7 to export anything to the outside world			0
@entity91 officials say these measures are intended to pressure @entity3 , which is on the @entity111 government list of terrorist groups , to stop its members and other factions from firing mortars and rockets into @entity91			1
@entity117 reports that 1,500 @entity119 rockets were fired into @entity91 from @entity7 in 2007 , and 2,383 in the past six years			2
as a result , almost all of @entity7 's factories have shut down and thousands of workers have lost their jobs			1
between 70 and 80 percent of the population is dependent on food supplied by the @entity128 @entity127 , set up after more than 700,000 @entity129 became refugees after the war that resulted in @entity91 's creation in 1948			2
life in @entity7 , never easy , in the last year has become a grinding daily struggle to make ends meet			0
for the vast majority of @entity86 , it means they must spend much of their time trying to secure basic commodities			1
such as cooking gas , which comes from @entity91			1
in the past , when supplies were plentiful , it was sold from the back of trucks and donkey carts			0
when there are supplies , people flock to a few distribution centers			0
one is a hot , crowded compound north of @entity18 , where the stench of gas is so strong you shudder with fear that someone will light a cigarette and the whole place will go up in flames			1
people have to wait for their cooking gas for hours some claim days , in the hot sun. there i met a woman who identified herself as @entity164 ( the mother of @entity165 ) , who at 2 p.m. told me she had been waiting since 5 a.m. she said she had run out of cooking gas three days before			1
typical of so many people here , she blamed both main @entity129 factions for her woes			0
" @entity3 has n't done anything for us , nor has @entity4 , " she said			1
" all those people want is to sit comfortably on their thrones			0
" in @entity18 , long lines of immobile cars and trucks wind around the block from gas stations , their owners waiting , surprisingly patiently , for supplies to arrive			0
the only other option is to go in search of black market gasoline , much of it smuggled through tunnels from @entity186			0
it goes for more than $ 10 a liter , which comes close to almost $ 50 a gallon			0
it is now common for families to divide up responsibilities for the day			0
one family member will go in search of cooking gas , another will join the line for gasoline or diesel , another for whatever else is in short supply			2
to get around the shortages , some motorists mix their fuel with cooking oil , a practice that is n't particularly good for the motor			1
many people complain that it 's unhealthy -- but it works			0
others , like electrical engineer @entity213 , are thinking completely outside the box			0
@entity213 has invented an electric car , which he is more than happy to show off			0
he 's already received dozens of orders from motorists weary of the search for fuel			2
beyond material concerns , there are worries here that @entity3 has a barely concealed hardline @entity224 agenda , and one often hears complaints that the group is intolerant of any form of dissent or criticism			2
one man who can testify to that is @entity232 , the most senior @entity4 leader to remain in @entity7 after most fled to safety in @entity234			2
@entity232 is from the @entity4 old school , a grizzled veteran of the group 's wars in @entity239			1
he told me earlier this year @entity3 security officials showed up at his home late at night , bound his hands , put a blindfold on him and dragged him to their headquarters , where they shaved his head and cut off his moustache , then released him without apology or explanation			1
he makes no excuses for @entity4 's dismal track record of corruption and mismanagement when it ran @entity7 , but says the crisis that began with @entity3 ' rise to power is nothing short of a catastrophe			1
" our people has been transformed , " he said , " into a desperate people , who must search for food , for the minimum of survival			0
it 's as if we returned to 1948 , dependent on gifts and assistance and relief			0
" despite all the difficulties of life under @entity3 , despite all the grumbling , the men who run @entity7 are as confident today as they were a year ago that they will weather the crisis and emerge stronger			1
last wednesday i went to see @entity273 , a senior adviser to @entity3 prime minister @entity274			2
" whatever the @entity91 think , " said the @entity111 - educated @entity273 , " whatever pressure they put on us , it 's not going to make us buckle or give concessions			0
" this is part of the @entity129 struggle for more than 60 years living in the refugee camps , " he said			0
" we do n't always enjoy a good life			0
it 's the toughness and the suffering [ that ] are part of the struggle			0
" others here do n't quite see it that way , like a man i met in @entity7 's old market who would only identify himself as @entity292			2
i asked him if he was better off today than a year ago			0
he laughed , cursed @entity91 , @entity3 , @entity4 , the @entity111 , the @entity293 and the rest of the world , then made the following suggestion : " let them open a market in @entity7 so we can sell some of our children [ in order to ] feed the rest			1

@entity8 describes violence , gunbattles , fear before @entity3
reports on encounters with assault rifles , children running from *gunfire* last year
now , it 's safer but @entity86 desperate for gas , cooking fuel , jobs
