@entity0 -- president @entity2 outlined his final version of a health care bill wednesday and urged @entity5 to bring the plan to a conclusive vote within the next few weeks			1
the president said his nearly $ 1 trillion proposal is a compromise plan that combines the best ideas of both @entity12 and @entity13			2
he asked @entity5 to " finish its work " and end what has become a yearlong vitriolic legislative showdown over his top domestic priority			0
" everything there is to say about health care has been said , and just about everybody has said it , " he said			1
" now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health care so that it works , not just for the insurance companies , but for @entity29 's families and @entity29 's businesses			1
" he also came out in support of a controversial legislative maneuver known as reconciliation , which would allow changes to the health care bill to be passed by the @entity36 with only 51 votes -- a bare legislative majority			1
the bill " deserves the same kind of up - or - down vote " that was used to pass president @entity43 's signature tax cuts and welfare reform in the 1990s , @entity2 said at the @entity39			1
" at stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem , but our ability to solve any problem , " he said			0
" the @entity29 people want to know if it 's still possible for @entity0 to look out for their interests and their future			0
they are waiting for us to act			0
" he said he does n't " know how this plays politically , " but knows that " it 's right			0
" @entity13 have repeatedly said @entity2 's proposal amounts to a government takeover of the private health care system that will do little to control spiraling medical inflation			1
in recent weeks , they have reiterated their calls for the president to scrap his plan and start over			1
@entity67 leaders also fiercely oppose the use of reconciliation , saying it was never meant to be used for such a major policy change			1
" i am disappointed that @entity12 are moving ahead with the nuclear option , " said @entity72 rep. @entity71 , the top @entity73 on the @entity74			0
" @entity77 social policy changes should have bipartisan support and the support of the @entity29 people			2
but as bad as the process for moving this bill is , the policy and its impact is far worse			2
" multiple @entity86 sources have told @entity1 that the emerging consensus plan is for the @entity88 to pass the @entity36 bill and send it to @entity2			2
a package of changes that mirror the president 's plan would then be passed through both chambers under reconciliation rules			2
@entity12 increasingly brought up the prospect of using reconciliation after losing their 60 - vote , filibuster - proof @entity36 majority in january , when @entity67 sen. @entity99 won the @entity36 seat previously held by the late sen. @entity101 , a @entity102			2
observers note , however , that it remains unclear exactly which health care provisions can be approved under reconciliation , which is reserved for legislation pertaining to the budget			1
if enacted , the president 's sweeping compromise plan would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity113 and @entity114 more than four decades ago			1
the @entity39 says it would extend coverage to 31 million @entity29			0
among other things , @entity2 's plan would expand @entity113 prescription drug coverage , increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate increases by health insurance companies			1
it increases the threshold -- relative to the @entity36 bill passed in december -- under which a tax on high - end health insurance plans would kick in			0
the president 's proposal also includes significant reductions in @entity113 spending , in part through changes in payments made under the @entity139 program			0
it does not , however , include a government - run public health insurance option -- an idea strongly backed by @entity12 but fiercely opposed by @entity13 and key @entity86 moderates			0
it also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the @entity36 bill worked in by sen. @entity148 , a @entity149 @entity102 , that exempts that state from paying increased @entity114 expenses			0
administration officials say @entity2 's measure would cut the deficit by $ 100 billion over the next 10 years			2
they estimate the total cost of the bill to be $ 950 billion in the next decade			0
@entity2 extended a final bipartisan olive branch to @entity67 leaders tuesday , saying in a letter that he is willing to consider several of their ideas in a compromise plan			1
among other things , the president said he is willing to commit $ 50 million to fund state initiatives designed to reduce medical malpractice costs			0
he backed undercover investigations of health care providers receiving @entity113 , @entity114 , and other federal programs			1
the president also backed @entity114 reimbursement increases to doctors in certain states , and supported language ensuring certain high - deductible health plans can be offered in the health exchange			2
the president said his decision to consider the @entity67 ideas was a result of last week 's health care summit			1
@entity67 leaders , however , have said they are unsatisfied with @entity2 's concessions			1
" the only thing that will be bipartisan about this proposal will be the opposition to it , " promised senate minority leader @entity184 , @entity185			0
" the @entity29 people are not for this			0
" @entity192 predicted that " every election in @entity29 this fall will be a referendum on this issue			0

new : " now is the time to make a decision " about health care reform , president says
new : @entity2 backs reconciliation , controversial tactic that requires only 51 votes
but @entity67 says reconciliation never meant to be used for such a major policy change
@entity67 leaders have reiterated calls for president to scrap his plan , start over
