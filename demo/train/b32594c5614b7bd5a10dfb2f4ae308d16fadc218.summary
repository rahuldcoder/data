@entity0 -- the leader of @entity0 's leftist @entity3 , @entity4 , announced tuesday that he has asked @entity0 's @entity5 for a recount of the ballots cast in sunday 's presidential election			1
@entity4 's demand came the day after he said the vote had been " plagued by irregularities			1
" election authorities have projected @entity4 as the runner - up in the vote			1
@entity0 's presumed president - elect , @entity15 , said monday it was time for his country to leave behind the political rancor of campaign season			1
political tensions flare after @entity22 presidential vote the @entity5 , known by its @entity25 acronym @entity23 , says it expects the final count results sunday			1
that 's when each of the approximately 143,000 polling stations are supposed to have finished counting votes and signed an " act " detailing the number of votes			2
wednesday marks the beginning of the district count , in which each of the 300 electoral districts will scrutinize the acts			2
ballots will be recounted in cases where : -- the difference between the first and second place candidate is 1 % or less ; -- the number of annulled votes is greater than the difference between the first and second place candidates			2
@entity47 , international coordinator of information for @entity23 , said she expects the law to mandate recounts in 19 districts , representing about a third of the total ballots cast			2
@entity4 must wait until sunday to formally submit any application for a recount to the @entity56			1
any candidate can challenge , but @entity59 candidate @entity58 has already conceded			0
the @entity3 candidate 's declarations echoed comments he made in 2006 , when election authorities said the leftist candidate narrowly lost the presidential race to @entity66			1
@entity4 claimed election fraud and never conceded , referring to himself afterward as " the legitimate president of @entity0			1
" at the time , his supporters protested nationwide			1
in @entity0 , they staged sit - ins and blockades			1
in 2006 , official results showed him losing by about 240,000 votes ( or about 0.6 % )			1
he led marches and demonstrations and refused to concede ; a partial recount was held			0
@entity66 was not declared president - elect until two months after the july election			1
@entity4 did not accept that decision			1
a brawl broke out in the legislature before @entity66 was scheduled to take the oath on december 1 ; @entity66 sneaked in and out a back door to take the oath and gave the traditional speech not in @entity87 , but at another location			1
on monday , @entity4 had called on his supporters to wait for the official results			1
the @entity5 's verification of individual poll results begins wednesday			1
but in an op - ed article published in tuesday editions of the @entity94 , @entity15 made it clear that he thinks the election is over and he has won			1
" achieving our country 's full potential is my mission as @entity0 's next president , " he wrote			1
earlier , @entity15 told @entity1 en @entity102 he was ready to work across party lines to build a better @entity0			0
" we have to be constructive and put aside our differences , which are only for competitions and electoral contests , " @entity15 said monday			0
" yesterday i indicated that ( after ) this tense and divisive atmosphere , which is natural in all democratic contests , we have to turn the page and move on to enter another chapter , another moment in our political lives , with a willingness and spirit that are constructive and purposeful			1
" a quick count based on samples from polling stations throughout the country gave @entity15 the lead , with between 37.93 % and 38.55 % of votes , the @entity5 said late sunday			2
on monday , the presumed president - elect said he had been receiving congratulatory phone calls and messages from world leaders , including @entity127 president @entity126			1
@entity15 said he was unfazed by the fact that more than 50 % of @entity22 had not voted for him			0
opinion : is @entity15 good news for @entity0 ? " we , fortunately , live in democratic conditions with three predominant political forces , and this makes it very hard for any party to have an absolute majority , " he told @entity1 en @entity102			2
the projected victory for @entity15 marks a triumphant return to power for the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , which lost its grip on @entity0 's presidency to the conservative @entity59 in 2000			0
the @entity5 's projections raised two key questions rooted in @entity0 's complicated political past : has the @entity140 , a political party that critics accuse of being authoritarian and corrupt , changed its approach ? and will supporters of @entity4 protest election results as they have in the past ? @entity15 said sunday night that he was looking forward , not back			1
" we are a new generation			0
there is no return to the past			0
my government will have its vision based in the future , " he told reporters			0
on the local level , there may not be many differences between today 's @entity140 and the political party that dominated @entity0 for decades , said @entity166 , director of the @entity167 at the @entity168			2
" what 's changed on the national stage is that @entity22 citizens have different expectations for their federal government that are going to force the @entity140 to govern in a different way than it did 20 years ago , " he said			0
for much of the @entity140 's rule , the political party controlled not only the presidency , but also national and state legislatures and local governments across the country			1
now , in the country 's @entity182 , a preliminary tally monday showed the @entity140 winning only 33 of 128 seats			2
in the @entity185 , the @entity140 had secured more seats than any other party , according to the preliminary tally			0
but opposition parties combined held a majority of seats			0
" then , the @entity140 was really a party that included all of @entity0 , that had a broad patronage network and tolerated little dissent outside of the party , " @entity166 said			0
" and the @entity140 today is going to have to deal with opposition parties that have tasted power , an active citizenry that expects to be involved in major policies decisions , and a very vigilant press that will report on everything that happens			0
" weeks before sunday 's vote , criticisms of @entity15 and concerns about the @entity140 's possible return to power fueled a student movement that staged demonstrations throughout the country			2
on monday , outraged students from the group marched in @entity0			0
they carried signs that said , " @entity0 without @entity140 " and " @entity0 voted , and @entity15 did not win			0
" analysts : @entity22 vote leaves more questions than it answers but while critics slam @entity15 , the charismatic 45 - year - old former governor galvanized fervent support among residents of his home state and party loyalists nationwide			2
the @entity222 , @entity224 / @entity223 and @entity225 firms said their exit poll results projected a win for @entity15 , with more than 40 % of voters saying they cast ballots for the @entity140 candidate			2
@entity15 's campaign platform included plans to stop the rise in food prices , promote energy reform , give social security to all @entity22 and reduce violence nationwide			0
" he is obviously prepared			0
there was obviously a dirty war against him , " said @entity238 , 58 , as she prepared to cast a ballot for @entity15 at a @entity0 elementary school on sunday			0
critics lamenting the possible return of the @entity140 to power are n't thinking straight , she said			0
" that 's all in the past , " @entity247 said			0
" what 's important is that he is young and has all the ability to represent us			0

@entity4 also challenged the 2006 election results
@entity66 was not declared president - elect until 2 months after the 2006 election
the presumed president - elect says it is time for the country to leave behind political rancor
