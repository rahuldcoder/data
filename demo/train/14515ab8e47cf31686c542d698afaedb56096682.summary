-- no , not all men channel frustration over romantic rejection into a killing spree			1
but yes , all women experience harassment , discrimination or worse at some point in their lives			2
that 's the message at the core of an ongoing @entity12 conversation that emerged after a rampage last week that left six students from the @entity15 , @entity15 , dead and wounded 13 others			1
@entity17 , who apparently shot and killed himself , left behind a robust digital footprint detailing his plan to " destroy everything i can not have , " blaming the " cruelness of women " for leading to his " day of retribution			2
" his comments inspired @entity12 users to tweet the hashtag # @entity27 : they shared examples of what " women must fear " even if " not all men " engage in those behaviors , according to the person believed to have created the hashtag saturday			1
the person did not respond to @entity0 's request for comment			2
the hashtag -- a response to the " not all men " defense sometimes used to deflect feminist arguments -- spread quickly on @entity12 , zeroing in on the subtle and explicit signals that a woman 's worth is based on her availability to men			1
by tuesday morning , # @entity49 had been tweeted more than 1 million times			1
expanding the conversation # @entity27 is the latest @entity12 hashtag to draw attention to violence against women in a global conversation that has spread from social media to college campuses and into the @entity59			1
while most feminist - driven @entity12 campaigns preach to the choir , # @entity27 has succeeded in drawing the mainstream -- including men -- into the conversation , feminist writer and political analyst @entity60 said			1
more unique is the conversation 's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men , @entity60 said , pointing to tweets from men as evidence			2
there was backlash to the hashtag 's sentiment , too			0
some challenged the idea that misogyny was behind @entity17 's killing spree , while others argued against the broader idea that most women face gender - based harassment			1
but those tweeting # @entity27 interpreted backlash as evidence to prove their points			1
# @entity27 's forebears include # everydaysexism , which evolved from the website @entity93			1
in 2011 , the site launched as a place for people to share stories of gender - based harassment			1
today , # everdaysexism exists as a continuous feed of examples of street harassment , and as an occasional rallying cry around petitions			1
it has been tweeted more than 520,000 times in the past year , according to social web search engine @entity107			0
earlier this year , @entity60 started # rapecultureiswhen in response to a @entity111 op - ed calling for an end to " rape culture hysteria			2
" the hashtag highlighted examples of victim blaming and was tweeted more than 67,000 times			0
with more than 1.2 million tweets so far , # @entity27 has far outpaced both hashtags , according to @entity107			1
it has drawn comments from celebrities such as @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
celebrity boost aside , # @entity27 's universal appeal springs from " bottom - up " personal stories instead of a single omniscient voice in an op - ed , @entity60 said			1
" it 's not somebody on high saying this is a problem in society and everyone should fix it , " she said			0
" it 's people talking about real experiences , and each experience is validated by the next			2
" more than internet slacktivism even though # @entity27 grew as a counterpoint to the " not all men " argument , it 's effective because it stands on its own , feminist media critic @entity143 said			1
in fact , @entity17 's killing spree shows that men can also be victims of hostility toward women : four men were among those killed , including his two roommates , " the biggest nerds i had ever seen , " @entity17 said			1
@entity17 left behind a 137 - page " manifesto " in which he wrote , " i 've wanted love , affection , adoration			2
you think i 'm unworthy of it			0
that 's a crime that can never be forgiven			0
" " i do n't know what you do n't see in me			0
i 'm the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me , the supreme gentleman , " @entity17 said in a @entity167 video posted the day of the killings			2
@entity143 said his words echoed sentiments voiced by men 's rights activists in online forums and social media platforms , especially @entity12			2
those murmurs rarely turn deadly , she said , but @entity17 's actions represent every woman 's worst fears			1
" it 's been a collective trigger for women			0
it 's an extreme case of something we see and experience regularly as part of our lives , but it 's shocking and jarring and scary to see it taken to these lengths , " said @entity143 , who founded the women 's network @entity185			0
despite its grim origins , # @entity27 advanced conversation around issues that dominate feminist circles , feminist writer @entity193 said			1
the hashtag sparked more discussion about rape in @entity202 and @entity203 , and college campus sex assault in the @entity205			0
the hashtag also forced discussion of the intersection of mental illness and misogyny in violence against women , especially in mass shootings , which are overwhelmingly perpetrated by white men			0
" i do n't know how anyone can look at this information and not see how densely matrixed all these factors and events are , " @entity193 said			0
" we keep seeing this pattern repeated and people seem to think misogyny or mental illness are exclusive or need to be prioritized			0
" while there 's no tangible outcome to the hashtag 's spread , those involved said it 's far from the typical slacktivism			0
it created a virtual space for women to share their stories , @entity193 said			0
" while there 's a lot of harm that can happen online , the @entity234 ( has been ) so fundamentally transformative for women and feminists , " she said			0
" women who were isolated in their experiences by culture and their families for the first time can exceed those boundaries			0
