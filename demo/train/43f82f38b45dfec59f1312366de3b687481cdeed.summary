-- the football world had n't seen anything quite like it before			0
on tuesday night the @entity5 giants of @entity6 took on @entity7 in @entity8 in what should have been an empty stadium			1
a pitch invasion by @entity6 's notoriously boisterous fans during a friendly in july had forced the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) to ban the male supporters from attending two games as punishment			1
instead as many as 43,000 women and children took advantage of free tickets to fill the stands with songs , banners and passion every bit as intense as their male compatriots			0
" this atmosphere was one of the kind and historic in the sense of @entity5 football as well as international football , " @entity6 's vice-president @entity28 told @entity0 's @entity29			1
" the women of @entity6 sports club have shown us what they can do for their club , what they can do for @entity5 football and i think this was an event that was exemplary for sports			1
" @entity6 won last year 's @entity5 championship but a cloud has hung over the club since allegations of match fixing came to light during the summer			1
several of @entity5 's highest profile football figures have been arrested during the investigations which lead to the @entity14 withdrawing @entity6 from this year 's @entity54 group stage draw			1
tuesday night 's match was going to be another night of shame for @entity5 football , until the @entity14 allowed children under 12 and an accompanying adult to attend 24 hours before kick off			1
by the next morning thousands of women in @entity6 shirts lined up for tickets and images were beamed across the globe of what was surely the highest female attendance at a men 's match in world football			2
it was a good news story for @entity6 just when @entity5 football needed it			1
" tuesday night we had 43,000 fans in the stadium , " @entity28 told @entity0			2
" as you know the club is going through some troubled times with allegations of match fixing ... the fans have gone beyond the call of duty to embrace the club and fight for the rights of the club			2
" according to @entity6 has long pursued a more family - friendly approach and regularly attract up to 8,000 women , around 20 per cent of the crowd			0
" lot of songs , a lot of chanting and solidarity , " @entity28 replied when asked how the atmosphere differed to a typical match day			2
" a man has less patience waiting in line for tickets			0
coming to the stadium of course men are lot more loud and more synchronized but the women were a lot more passionate and a lot more encouraging			0
" but the crowd was not rewarded with the victory that their efforts demanded			0
the match ended 1 - 1 but for @entity103 the effects will last long after the final whistle			0
" i think it 's important for @entity5 because we [ were ] a candidate to host the @entity117 , @entity115 , @entity109 and these committees are all sensitive to the abilities of the organizing host country to fill the stadiums [ and ] in this direction it was a big positive			0
" " we 're disappointed we could n't send the ladies home with a victory			0

as many as 43,000 mostly female fans watch @entity6 play @entity7 in @entity8
male fans had been banned because of a pitch invasion last july
