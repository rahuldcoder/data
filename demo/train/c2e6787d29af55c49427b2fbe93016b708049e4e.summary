@entity20 ' idea to start a cuddling business materialized back in january 2013			2
she came across a photo on @entity23 of a man offering free hugs , and a newly divorced @entity20 thought to herself that she would definitely pay someone for a hug right at that moment			0
" just because i do n't have someone in my life does n't mean i do n't deserve affection and touch , " she said			2
the thought of cuddling a stranger on @entity3 might seem creepy , but @entity20 said the problem lies with people 's perception			1
" in our culture , cuddling is connected with romantic relationships			1
platonic touch is such a taboo thing , " she said			1
" there are a lot of moms who give a lot of touch , but they never really take			2
so they come into ( my business ) and get touch from me			2
" @entity53 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity54 , co-authored a study on the effects of cuddling in a relationship after sex			2
she said there is research to suggest that cuddling , which is commonly associated with romantic relationships , can also be found in platonic relationships as well			1
" it was n't always a sexual thing , " @entity53 said			0
touch is a way for people to feel closer to one another , she said			2
" people have a need to belong and connect to others and affection is one way we may do this			0
" one reason platonic touch in a professional setting can be appealing to some is because it can be less intimidating than a romantic encounter , @entity53 said			1
" there are fewer risks of rejection			0
" the idea of being hugged and not judged pulled @entity12 in			0
she was experiencing feelings of unworthiness and loneliness when she entered @entity20 ' @entity10 storefront more than a year ago			0
the math tutor drove an hour from her home in @entity93 to find out what platonic cuddling meant			1
after her first session with @entity20 , @entity12 felt like she was on a runner 's high			0
" after i see her , i am pretty high for a couple of days			0
i am seriously addicted to it , " @entity12 said			0
" i think about if i have a ding in my car and i have a $ 500 deductible , that $ 500 could give me 500 minutes of cuddling			2
" the hour - long cuddle sessions she has with @entity20 once a week have boosted @entity12 's confidence			0
she 's more open about wanting affection now			0
she routinely requests hugs from her family and friends and even cuddles with her sister			2
@entity12 thinks the @entity7 is the perfect way to introduce the benefits of touch not only to those who are single , but to people in relationships			1
" there are couples out there where one person is more affectionate than the other			0
maybe if they can bring their partner to the convention to show them cuddling is normal , " @entity12 said			1
@entity20 sees 2015 as the year of the cuddle and hopes people will start to see the positives of platonic touch			1
" i think we all struggle with the concept of being good enough , " @entity20 said			0
" people think ' i have to lose 50 pounds so i can start dating			0
' no you do n't , you are good enough right now			0
