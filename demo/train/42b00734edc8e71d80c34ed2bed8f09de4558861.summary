-- you knew it was coming : flu season 's back , and there 's no telling how mild or wild it will be ( remember swine flu ? )			1
" the severity of each season is unpredictable , " confirms dr. @entity7 , an epidemic intelligence service officer at the @entity8 ( @entity8 )			1
same goes for ye olde common cold , which also strikes this time of year			2
but thanks to scientists who are constantly working to learn the best ways to fight germs and build a better flu shot , it 's gotten easier than ever to protect yourself			1
follow their advice , and this could be the year you do n't get sick			2
get a flu shot ( pronto ! ) flu season runs from october to may , so if you have n't gotten jabbed , now 's the time			1
" the vaccine takes anywhere from two to four weeks to take effect , and it lasts for at least six months , so if you get it now , you 'll be primed for the flu 's peak in january or february , " says @entity30 , an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at @entity33 in @entity34			1
the @entity8 recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated			2
about 200,000 people are hospitalized with flu - related complications each year , and thousands die			1
in fact , as many as 18,000 people in the @entity47 are estimated to have lost their lives to the @entity51 epidemic of 2009			2
@entity0 : 10 ways you increase your flu risk ( without realizing it ) women may be more likely than men to end up in the hospital with severe flu symptoms , notes @entity60 , an assistant professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at @entity33 who researches sex differences in infectious disease			1
that 's because women 's bodies mount higher immune responses to germs			2
a quick refresher on how the shot works : every year , @entity8 scientists figure out which strains of influenza are most likely to run rampant based on data from the previous flu season , then put dead forms of those strains into the vaccine			1
when you get the shot , your immune system produces targeted antibodies to beat those specific viruses -- that way you 'll be pre-equipped to fight off the live germs if you come in contact with them in the real world			1
the vaccine is at least 60 % effective -- no , not 100 % , but " even if you do get the flu after being vaccinated , your symptoms will likely be less severe because of the partial immunity you 've built up , " says dr. @entity96 , a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at @entity98			1
you might have a sore arm or redness after getting the shot , but that 's your immune system 's response to the vaccine ; you ca n't actually get the flu from the vaccine			1
( note : the shot can cause a reaction in people allergic to eggs , so if that 's you , talk to your doc before getting it			1
) to avoid soreness altogether , ask for @entity114 , the needle - free nasal spray vaccine ( unless you 're pregnant , over 50 , or have a chronic condition like asthma -- the spray is n't yet approved for those folks )			0
@entity0 : what ails you : @entity121 , flu or something else ? stay away from sickies the flu gets passed around primarily when infected people sneeze , cough , or just talk , sending tiny , virus - filled water droplets out of their mouths and noses and into yours , from as far as six to 10 feet away			1
so if a co-worker shows up complaining about aches and pains , or you notice someone wheezing next to you on the bus or in line at @entity137 , you should stay at least 10 feet away , if possible -- " 15 feet if the person 's really sick , " says @entity138 , director of clinical microbiology and immunology at @entity141 in @entity142			0
switch seats on public transportation or at the movies if you have to			0
( and if you 're that coughing , sneezing person -- stay the heck home , for the sake of those around you			0
) @entity152 supplements no help for colds , flu although you probably wo n't get influenza from pressing an elevator button or using a keyboard that a sick person has handled , you could catch a cold , since that virus is mainly passed around by touch			1
so it 's smart to clean shared telephones and laptops with a disinfecting wipe			0
also , like @entity166 said , wash your hands ! soap up or use an alcohol - based sanitizer , especially before you eat or touch your eyes , nose , or face , and after you 've been in the bathroom			0
if you 've got a sick child or spouse at home , you ca n't exactly banish ' em to the backyard			0
just wash your hands more than usual and avoid kissing and sharing drinks or utensils with family members ; they can shed live viruses for five days after symptoms are gone			0
@entity0 : how to stop a cold in its tracks sleep in this weekend you always hear that rest is important when you 're under the weather , but research shows that it really could make the difference between who gets sick and who does n't			1
in a study from @entity195 , people who got eight or more hours of sleep were less likely to come down with a cold than those who 'd snoozed for fewer than seven hours , even when a live virus was placed directly in their nose			2
( suddenly , staying up late to catch up on @entity199 does n't sound quite as tempting			0
) even if you do n't have time for a nap , doing some meditation could really help to ward off colds and flu : in a new study from the @entity207 , people who took an eight - week course in mindfulness meditation were about 30 % less likely to get sick than non-ommers			2
no need to take a class ; simply sit still and focus on your inhales and exhales for several minutes every day			0
@entity0 : superfoods that fight colds eat to boost your immunity what you put in your mouth can make a huge difference in how well your body fights off cold and flu germs			2
step one : cut back on fatty foods and eat more of the stuff that boosts your immune response , like fruit and vegetables , experts advise			0
federal guidelines recommend that we get five to nine servings of fruit and veggies a day			0
at the very least , have one at every meal or snack -- " especially orange , yellow - orange , and deep green produce , which are highest in the symptom - beating antioxidants you need now : vitamin c , @entity243 , and beta - carotene , " says dr. @entity245 , a @entity246 internist , @entity249 diet and fitness expert and author of @entity251			0
@entity152 is another nutrient to amp up on : one recent @entity254 study found that being deficient may leave us particularly vulnerable to colds and flu			2
because it 's tough to get enough from sunlight ( which triggers the body to create it ) or food , " i put my patients on 1,000 @entity263 a day , " @entity245 says			0
@entity0 : 7 healthy chicken soup recipes most important , eat a well - balanced diet that 's not lacking in any nutrient , including calories			0
" flu season -- or any season ! -- is no time to go on a crash diet , " @entity245 says			1
" severely limiting calories can decrease your body 's defenses			0
" pass the sweet potatoes ! @entity276 2011			0

@entity121 and flu season runs from october through may
your best means of protection is getting a flu shot
eating well and getting plenty of sleep can also help
