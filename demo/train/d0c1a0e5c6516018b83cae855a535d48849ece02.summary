-- the tragic fate of @entity2 , believed shot down by a missile in eastern @entity4 , killing all 298 on board , has cast a new light on the series of gambles @entity10 president @entity9 embarked on in late february			1
at that time , @entity9 sent military intelligence troops in unmarked uniforms to take control of the southern @entity4 peninsula of @entity15			1
three weeks later , @entity10 annexed the region			1
as @entity10 - speaking @entity4 farther north in @entity18 and @entity19 stormed administrative buildings , demanding independence from @entity22 , @entity10 intelligence officers started slipping across the border to help organize the militias			1
in subsequent months , @entity25 supplied the separatist guerrillas with artillery , tanks and anti-aircraft weapons			0
@entity9 's goal appeared to be to pressure @entity4 's leaders to negotiate with the @entity10 - backed rebels and offer constitutional autonomy to the country 's eastern regions			1
intimidated by the superiority of the @entity10 army , @entity22 -- it seemed -- would have to buckle under			2
this strategy was failing even before the @entity41 tragedy			0
soon after his election last may , @entity4 's new president , @entity42 , launched a determined military campaign to crush the separatist guerrillas			1
although he might have been willing to negotiate with @entity9 , he showed no inclination to talk to the swashbuckling @entity10 desperadoes on the ground			1
the success @entity42 's operation was having explains why recently @entity25 reportedly supplied its proxies with at least one radar - guided @entity53 missile system that could destroy @entity4 military planes flying at high altitudes			2
such missiles also had the range to hit the commercial airliners that continued to cross the conflict zone			0
while the facts about who shot down @entity64 can only be settled by a full investigation , @entity4 's government has said it has " compelling evidence " that a @entity10 - supplied battery , manned by @entity10 operatives , fired the missile			1
' @entity70 ' for @entity9 suddenly , the risks inherent in @entity9 's gamble are glaringly obvious			2
by supplying weapons to the rebel militias , with their strange mix of intelligence agents , local thugs and trigger - happy @entity10 volunteers , @entity9 made himself a hostage to their brutish blundering			1
on saturday , some of these " freedom fighters , " apparently drunk , were said to be manhandling the corpses , while barring @entity86 observers from the crash site			0
all must now await the results of the international investigation			0
if it concludes that the plane was shot down by rebels using a @entity10 - supplied missile -- or , worse still , by @entity10 themselves -- the pressure on @entity9 will become intense			1
the @entity95 , led by president @entity96 , will demand that he cut off support to the rebels once and for all and seal the border			1
if @entity9 does not do so , tougher economic penalties are almost certain			2
already , the latest round of @entity103 sanctions , announced on july 17 , surprised observers by their severity			0
they targeted the third and fourth largest @entity10 banks -- @entity107 and @entity108 -- as well as the energy companies @entity109 and @entity111 , which are associated with the @entity9 cronies @entity112 and @entity113			1
@entity9 will , thus , have two options , both dangerous for his regime			1
he could reject the conclusions of the international investigation and stand by the separatists			1
this would result in serious damage to the @entity10 economy from sanctions that might now target whole sectors such as banking or energy			2
such measures would send the economy -- already forecast by the @entity127 to grow just 0.2 % this year -- into a painful recession			0
at the same time , the @entity129 would find itself more internationally isolated than at any time since the end of the @entity131			0
not just the @entity103 and @entity132 , but many other countries that were previously friendly or neutral would start to treat @entity9 as a pariah			1
and @entity9 would have to worry that his @entity135 s across the border might commit some new atrocity , provoking the world into even tougher countermeasures			2
opinion : how @entity142 disaster backs @entity10 's @entity9 into a corner @entity9 's second option would be to accept the report 's conclusions and cut off supply lines to the rebels			1
but that could create significant problems for him at home			0
to those informed about the conflict by @entity10 state - controlled television , such a turnaround would be bewildering			2
a relentless barrage of propaganda has convinced many @entity10 that their co-ethnics in @entity18 and @entity19 are being massacred by troops commanded by a fascist regime in @entity22			1
for @entity9 to bow to international pressure and abandon his former charges would look like cowardice			1
such a betrayal could quickly squelch the @entity167 euphoria			0
from the start , the @entity129 's strategy in @entity4 has aimed in part at consolidating domestic support			1
as the economy stagnates , @entity9 has sought to replace growth and prosperity as a basis for popularity with @entity178 nationalism and conservative values			2
in the past , xenophobic nationalists have been among the least favorable toward @entity9			0
his current astronomical ratings -- 86 % in the latest @entity183 poll -- suggest at least some temporary success in winning them over			0
were he to abandon the @entity187 insurgents , @entity9 could kiss such support goodbye			2
moreover , were he to admit that @entity10 - backed rebels fired the missile , the credibility of @entity10 state - controlled television would suffer			2
the main channels have pushed a variety of conspiracy theories , including one in which the @entity4 military shot down the plane , mistaking it for the jet flying @entity9 home from the @entity203 summit in @entity204			1
should @entity9 disavow such theories and endorse the @entity208 version , his propagandists would look like liars			0
it remains possible that the investigation will fail to reach any strong conclusions , leaving @entity9 some wiggle room			0
but at this point interpretations completely exonerating @entity10 are few and far between			0
" war , " wrote @entity215 , " is the province of chance			0
" the danger that a covert military operation could get out of hand should have been clear all along			0
for 14 years , @entity9 proceeded cautiously in international affairs , weighing expected costs and benefits before taking action			1
his decision to invade @entity15 was so uncharacteristically risky -- with such large potential costs and short - lived benefits -- that it took many observers by surprise			0
now , unless some new unexpected event turns up to rescue him , @entity9 faces an unappealing dilemma			0
either way , the risks are high			0
having gambled his way into trouble , he now has little choice but to roll the dice again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			0

@entity241 : @entity9 took a big risk when he annexed @entity15 , backed @entity4 separatists
he says the @entity10 president made himself hostage to brutish action of separatists
now @entity9 will either have to side with @entity95 or reject international *consensus*
@entity241 : @entity9 could make his regime a pariah or could lose support internally
