-- a 9 - year - old girl accidentally killed a shooting instructor with an @entity3 on monday , authorities in @entity5 said , and now the world is asking itself an absolutely absurd question : should a fourth - grader be legally allowed to shoot an @entity3 ? the only answer to that question is : hell fricking no -- it should be against the law			1
understand , i love shooting guns and so do my kids			1
my favorite gun is a 12 - gauge over / under shotgun			2
our teenage daughters prefer a .22 because it 's easier to aim and control			2
other than hooking a large brown trout , there 's nothing more thrilling in my book than pulling the trigger on a shotgun and managing to hit a target			2
kids and guns : what 's your parenting style ? but this is not a shotgun			1
this is a fully automatic machine gun developed by the @entity38 army			0
it is capable of firing 600 to 650 bullets a minute			0
as this @entity3 pumps out 10 bullets a second , the kickback is substantial			1
it is designed to be fired by a soldier during war , not a fourth - grader on vacation			0
it 's too powerful , it 's too big and it 's too deadly			0
many adult novices ca n't control that weapon			0
the @entity54 , @entity55 , said the full video of the incident was , as one might imagine , " ghastly			0
" this , of course , is n't the little girl 's fault ; was it even her idea to shoot an @entity3 in the first place ? it 's the instructor and the parents who are to blame -- i mean , what could possibly go wrong if you hand an @entity3 with the selector on fully automatic mode to a 9 - year - old ? for anyone who asks " what were they thinking ? " the answer is : they were n't			1
that 's why the law needs to change -- to protect kids from adult stupidity			1
this all seems particularly senseless to me because just two weeks ago on our own family vacation , we introduced our own 9 - year - old to the joys of target shooting and the responsibility of gun safety			0
here 's a photo of our son , supervised by instructors and with my father behind him on his first day at the range			1
he 's sitting down , so he can absorb any kick			0
he 's got on safety glasses and sound protection			0
the gun is resting against a table and the strap of the gun has been put around a railing on the table to hold it down			1
why do you take these precautions ? because when you introduce kids to the sport of shooting guns , you are taking on a great responsibility			1
this 9 - year - old girl is n't the only child to kill someone with an @entity3			1
an 8 - year - old boy in @entity118 killed himself a few years ago when he fired an @entity3 at a gun show , while supervised by his own father			1
the gun kicked up on the boy , and he shot himself in the head			0
the laws did n't change in @entity118 , and i 'm sure the @entity125 will see to it that they do n't change in @entity5			0
@entity5 laws require a person to be at least 21 years old to carry a firearm , but the laws do not apply on private property or if the minor is accompanied by a parent or certified instructor			1
kids ca n't drive until they 're 16 , vote , chew tobacco or smoke until they 're 18 , or drink until they 're 21			2
no child should have access to firing a fully automatic weapon until the age of 18			2
and gun ranges should know better than to hand one to a novice shooter passing through on vacation , let alone one as young as 9			0
the tragedy took place at @entity149 and burgers , where the website states " at our range , you can shoot full auto on our machine guns			2
let ' em rip ! " just because you can does n't mean you should .			0

@entity159 : gun instructor 's death raises absurd question : should kids fire @entity3 ?
she says of course not ! if kids learn about guns , should be in controlled safe *environment*
@entity171 : what parent would put such a gun in a kid 's hands and how could gun range allow it ?
she says giving kids under 18 access to a *submachine* gun should be illegal
