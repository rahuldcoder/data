-- glance at @entity7 's complex life story and it 's hard not to be reminded of the lyrics to @entity10 's classic song : " it 's a @entity12 " --- " blood 's thicker than the mud , it 's a family affair			1
" to start with there is the boxer 's relationship with his father , which has such a degree of bad blood that even psychoanalyst @entity19 might have trouble exploring the demons that have been unleashed between father and son			1
in may , the pair were professionally reunited for the first time in 13 years as @entity26 worked the corner during his son 's successful welterweight title defense against @entity30			1
the intervening years had been characterized by bitter rows and public slanging matches as the @entity33 fell out to such extent that @entity26 once told reporters he did not even know the names of two of his grandchildren			0
but as the man nicknamed " money " returned to the ring for the first time since serving a two - month jail term for a domestic violence conviction , he enlisted the help of his father			1
the official reason for his return two months ago was that the five - division world champion 's regular trainer -- @entity26 's brother @entity51 -- was too debilitated by diabetes to be relied upon			1
@entity53 had last taken charge of @entity26 's corner in 2000 prior to being booted out of his son 's house , and life , shortly after			2
defensive nous a notable feature of @entity63 's unanimous points decision over @entity30 , the @entity64 's interim champion while @entity7 was in prison , became the fact that he had tightened up his defense -- a product of his father 's work , the fighter says			1
" my dad is a remarkable trainer , a defensive wizard , " the man with the 44 - 0 record told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			2
" my dad brings everything			0
it all started with my father			2
what 's been installed in me from the beginning is the less you get hit , the longer you last in the sport			1
" @entity26 knows about the importance of avoiding major injury all too well			0
he has frequently recounted how he was shot in the leg by @entity85 -- the later brother of @entity63 's mother -- in 1978 " i got shot early in my career with a 20 gauge shotgun , " @entity26 has said			1
" and i was holding my son when i got shot			0
@entity26 was one at the time			2
" @entity26 was holding his son during the shooting incident to ensure he was not hit in the face or upper body - a move that he believes saved his life			2
" i was n't going to put that baby down , " @entity26 told the @entity97 in 2012			0
" i did n't want to die			0
it was n't about putting my son in the line of fire			0
i knew [ @entity85 ] would n't shoot the baby			0
so he took the gun off my face , lowered it to my leg and bam ! " @entity63 's defensive skills are such that he has long been known as " @entity7 " because of the fact he has boxed his many bouts so well his face has been largely unblemished			1
" it was basically for not taking any punishment , " said @entity63 " you know , i ca n't be over the age of 30 calling myself ' @entity7 '			1
" his fight against @entity30 was the first of a six - part deal with @entity116 , with every bout worth at least $ 32m to a sportsman named as the highest earner by @entity120 for 2012			2
when he signed the 30 - month deal in february , the 36 - year - old @entity7 said it would be his last as a professional fighter and that he would be retiring when the contract ended			1
but he seems to have had a change of heart given comments he made on monday while promoting his next fight -- against 22 - year - old @entity129 sensation @entity128 in september			2
" after my five more fights , guess what ? i think after ( getting to ) 49 - 0 we may stay in this sport a little longer , " @entity7 told a crowd some 5,000 strong at the @entity133 in @entity134			1
there has been speculation that @entity7 's decision to recall his father reveals a desire to finally bury the hatchet , with the 60 - year - old suffering from the lung disease sarcoidosis			1
when asked by @entity0 what he had learnt from his time in jail , a sentence earned after he assaulted his former partner @entity149 -- the mother of two of his children -- in 2010 , @entity7 gave the following reply			1
" never take anything for granted			0
as far as ... you could see a person here today and gone tomorrow			0
so never take anything for granted , " he said			0
family harmony @entity7 learnt his boxing skills from his father , a former fighter who was stopped by @entity160 in 10 rounds in 1978 , until @entity26 was given a five - and - a - half - year jail term for drug trafficking when his son was 16			1
it meant he was absent for the bronze medal his son won at the @entity167 in @entity168 and the start of his professional career later that year			0
@entity26 trained his son upon his release from prison in 1998 but the pair fell out soon after , with their last fight taking place in 2000 as the then junior lightweight champion defended his title			0
@entity26 's uncle @entity51 -- who won two titles himself in the 1990s -- took charge but there is little lost between the siblings , even if @entity185 may be trying to change this in what may prove to be his toughest fight so far			0
" he figures he can ( bring us together ) by having us in the corner together , " @entity51 told @entity189 in april			0
" that 's the only thing i can think of			0
all this time , @entity26 's been with me , the whole time he 's boxed			2
so for it to be something else , it 's something that he 's trying to mend			0
" and recent comments from @entity63 do nothing to dispel the notion that a man whose career is built upon effective violence is trying to bring harmony to a warring boxing dynasty			1
" the arguments we had in the past or the differences my dad and my uncle had in the pastâ € ” that 's the past , " @entity7 , who is often labeled the world 's best pound - to - pound boxer , said in may			1
" that 's why we call it the past because we try to leave that in the past and focus on the future and the future should be bright			0
