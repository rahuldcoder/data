-- perhaps it is fate -- or is it destiny ? @entity4 has been writing his own scripts for years , but the latest episode in the journey of the " @entity8 " could be something of a blockbuster			0
take a moment and picture the scene			0
the @entity14 arch , the trophy he considers his own , the city in which it so painfully eluded him and perhaps most importantly , the team which still mocks him by calling him ' the translator '			0
@entity14 -- @entity24 final -- @entity25 -- @entity26 versus @entity27			1
it 's a cast of which @entity29 would be proud			0
it has all the makings of a classic , but can the man who has already won @entity34 's greatest prize with @entity35 and @entity36 repeat the feat ? with his silver hair glistening beneath the floodlights , his hands in his pockets and that film star stare , @entity4 watched on as his @entity26 side dismissed @entity45 side @entity44 3 - 0 in the first leg of its @entity24 quarterfinal wednesday			1
only a miracle in @entity49 , something of @entity52 proportions , will now see @entity44 prevent @entity4 in his quest to become the first man to win @entity34 's greatest prize with three different clubs			1
and how sweet the triumph should the @entity58 coach end his time at the @entity61 by delivering the @entity62 known as " @entity63 "			0
yes , the tenth @entity24 is the one @entity26 so badly craves and for @entity4 , it would provide the perfect parting gift at the end of a season where he is widely expected to take his leave			1
embroiled in a spat with the @entity70 press , rumors of a split in the squad and his team 13 points off arch rival @entity27 at the top of @entity78 , this has been a turbulent year for @entity4			1
but this is a man who thrives under pressure , the man who enjoys employing the siege mentality , which he so famously instilled in his @entity86 side			2
that he never managed to win the @entity24 while in west @entity25 will remain a blot on his otherwise flawless copy book			2
but with @entity4 expected to leave @entity26 in the summer and @entity86 set to appoint a new manager at the end of the season , there are questions as to whether his return to @entity25 may extend beyond the 2013 @entity24 final			1
another @entity24 triumph would make him almost irresistible -- even to @entity86 owner @entity97			0
not since 2002 has @entity26 ruled @entity34 and while @entity27 and @entity99 remains its biggest rivals , the @entity4 factor can not be easily discounted			1
what is for certain is that there will be more testing nights ahead for this @entity26 team with a place in the semifinals all but assured			1
just nine minutes had elapsed when @entity107 's sumptuous through ball released @entity109 , who calmly fired home his ninth goal of the competition and 45th of the season			1
that strike might have dented the confidence of some teams , but @entity44 refused to bow and instead threatened to respond almost immediately			1
@entity116 , the man who inspired @entity86 to @entity24 success last season , curled just wide from the edge of the penalty area as the @entity45 side threatened an equalizer			2
uninhibited by the surroundings of the @entity124 and the presence of @entity109 , @entity44 appeared determined to take the game to its host			1
but while its intention was honorable , the naivety was plain for all to see as @entity26 used its pace and power to counter at every opportunity			2
@entity133 plundered a second on 29 minutes after the visiting defense had failed to clear @entity137 's right - wing cross			0
substitute @entity138 added a third after coming on as substitute to all but seal his side 's place in the last four with 17 minutes remaining			0
" if we score one more goal , they have to score five , " @entity4 told @entity142 following the victory			0
" the football i saw was very good , i saw a lot of incredible things - but @entity49 is a difficult place to play and they have players with a lot of experience , with great character and personality			0
" they will fight hard against us , but we will take it very seriously , its the only way to get through			0
" in the night 's other game , @entity160 escaped with a goalless draw at @entity163 after holding @entity164			1
the @entity70 club , which is making its debut in the @entity24 , extended its unbeaten home record in @entity34 competition to 14 matches			2
but it could have been quite different had the @entity170 not wasted a whole host of chances with @entity173 and @entity174 both failing to convert opportunities			1
and it was almost punished when @entity177 's rasping drive forced @entity164 keeper @entity178 into an impressive stop			2
" it 's a positive result because if we score there it will make it difficult for them , " @entity160 winger @entity180 told @entity181			2
" we have the same chance as they do of going through and we 'll try to repeat what we did tonight , playing a serious game and trying to grab the odd goal , " he added			0
" we came up against what we were expecting , which was a great team that plays football very well but we also had our chances			0
they made us suffer but we were expecting that			0
" @entity164 coach @entity199 insists he is more than happy with his side 's position going into next week 's second leg			1
he told reporters : " i can live with this 0 - 0			1
we did everything well from the first kick to the final whistle but it 's a higher level			0
" we know what we have to do in the return match			0

@entity26 *cruises* to 3 - 0 win over @entity44
@entity109 on target for @entity70 side in first leg victory
@entity160 and @entity164 finish goalless in opening game
@entity170 side wasted a number of *glorious* chances
