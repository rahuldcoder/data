-- " you 've got to save your best leadership for home			2
" these are the words of retired @entity6 commander lt. general @entity5 at a recent speaking event on leadership in the 21st century			2
two nights ago , i found my two most active roles in life -- family man and journalist -- intersecting in a crisis			1
it was 3 p.m. on tuesday afternoon when my wife alerted me			1
i was enjoying my afternoon off , comfortable in the warmth of our home , watching the snow from a rare winter storm blanket our deck and backyard			1
my wife , who is a fifth - grade school teacher in @entity25 , @entity26 , received word that her school was shutting down because of the inclement weather			1
" honey i 've got the kids			2
i 'm on my way home , " she said after school was dismissed early , and parents were rushing to get their children			2
as a journalist , i recognized that a news story was breaking before me			1
my wife 's normal 20 - minute daily commute was about to turn into an ordeal that would last nearly 24 hours			1
and i soon discovered that skills honed over years in the newsroom , were my best tools for assisting my wife and children			1
more than three hours later , she still had n't moved very far			2
we stayed in constant contact as she inched along the 6 - mile stretch of state highway leading her home			1
from the news , i soon realized this was no ordinary traffic jam			1
my family was stuck in gridlocked traffic caused by a one - two - punch of bad weather and poor government planning			1
@entity59 approached and my wife told me she had n't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m. the half - tank of gas she started with that afternoon had dwindled , and temperatures were well - below freezing			1
the kids had n't eaten			0
there was no restroom in sight			0
i felt hopeless and helpless			0
i called @entity68 and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles			1
i wanted to know how my family was going to be helped			1
they told me , " we do n't know sir			0
we 're trying , but we are out - manned now			1
" filled with adrenalin , i just could n't sit idle with my family stranded			1
i called local authorities and was told the same thing			0
by this time , i was so angry , i could n't think straight			0
i texted a friend who suggested prayer and texted me a bible verse to read , @entity81 4:1 - 14			1
i took to social media to help me cope with the situation and people reacted with posts of support			0
i stayed in touch with my wife a minimum of once per hour and at times twice per hour			1
on @entity90 , i posted : " more than 14 and a half hours , my wife and kids remain stranded in car stuck in traffic because of snow			1
been on phone w / state police repeatedly who agree w / me			0
all prayers are welcome as i 'm praying for the safe return of many of my friends in similar situations too			0
" my wife later told me she cried only once , around 5 a.m. , not knowing when she was going to be able to get the children home			1
she imagined having to wait for days , maybe until the snow and ice melted			1
it was so , so cold and she could n't keep the engine running all night for fear of running out of gas			0
that 's also about when i lost it , i told her -- about 5 a.m. at one point an act of kindness gave her hope : a truck driver knocked on the window in the middle of the night offering water and a blanket			0
she huddled the girls together in the front seat to keep them warm			0
" i did n't let the girls see me cry , " she said			0
i felt so guilty about it all			0
why did n't i fill up the car with gas ? why did n't i get the oil changed ? how could i drop the ball on my family ? i thought about @entity134 , who i have come to admire even more since hearing him talk about leadership and life lessons			1
i decided it was time to take action			0
i called the @entity68 and local authorities one more time			0
they could offer me very little			0
i told them if police could n't get my family , it was time for me to try			1
the state patrol dispatcher advised me to stay off the roads			2
it was now 20 hours into the ordeal			0
at day - break , i told my wife , " i am coming to get you			1
" she said she did n't think i could get to her			0
i said , " do n't worry about that			0
against advice of the local and state authorities , i 'm going to try			0
" i posted a message on @entity90 letting folks know what i was going to do and asked for prayers			0
the reaction came pouring in			0
i called my neighbor @entity158 , retired military and current investigator with a local district attorney 's office			0
taking me in his four - wheel - drive truck , @entity158 expertly traversed the thick ice on bridges passing hundreds of stranded vehicles along the way			2
i was laser focused on the mission : find my wife and kids and extricate them			2
i trudged up an ice - covered northbound lane of highway , as @entity177 's pickup made a zig - zag between hundreds of stranded vehicles to get to a safe stop			2
i grabbed each of my daughters , and carried them one by one across the median strip to the warmth of @entity177 's truck			2
then i escorted my wife into @entity177 's vehicle			2
i moved my wife 's car into the median and left it there not knowing or caring when the traffic would start to move			1
i was leading my family home .			2

@entity195 is both father and @entity3 journalist
he was frustrated when his wife and daughters were *trapped* in snow - bound traffic
using journalist training and *inspiration* from heroe , he took to the roads to rescue family
