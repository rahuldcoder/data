-- it 's home to a sound system from @entity3 and an elephant slide from @entity5			0
it 's where you 'll find an outdoor @entity10 boxing ring , exercise gear from @entity13 beach , lampposts from the @entity15 and swing benches from @entity17			1
this is @entity19 , an urban park and cycling gateway that sprawls through @entity22 , a bohemian neighborhood of @entity23 that 's become one of the most ethnically diverse parts of @entity26			1
a far cry from the @entity29 and traditional waterfront buildings of @entity32 canal , this willfully eclectic venue might be considered the world 's most surreal public space			1
stretching along a half - mile - long cycle route , @entity19 is a colorful exercise in community building born from a collaboration between residents and some of @entity41 's most experimental architects			1
i start my exploration of @entity19 's three distinctive zones with a slice of @entity46			1
at the top of the zone known as @entity49 stands a 14 - meter - tall pole with a giant " donut " and a neon sign			0
it hails from a restaurant in @entity55 and looks like something conjured in a dream by a salivating @entity58			0
@entity60 highway setting when viewed from a distance , the doughnut sign and shiny logos from the car dealerships across the road create the perfect tableau for an @entity60 highway setting			0
heading south into the park , i 'm greeted by a large cast iron bull , a tribute to the famous @entity72 sherry trademark			2
next up is a basketball court that sits in a bowl - shaped concrete structure			0
the court is modeled on @entity77 's @entity76 , a venue once used by the militant @entity80 group to launch assaults on @entity83 's presidential palace , and which now serves as the training facility for the country 's national basketball teams			1
then there are all the smaller objects , which i initially walk straight past but which @entity19 's smartphone app guides me to via an interactive map			1
there are trash cans from the @entity95 seaside resort of @entity96 , drains from @entity97 , a manhole cover from @entity99 and seven different types of bike racks from across @entity41			0
it 's a multicultural onslaught			0
some of the objects in @entity19 are originals while others are replicas designed so that they comply with @entity26 regulations for playground materials and public spaces			1
the items were chosen after canvassing local ideas online and at community meetings			1
residents were n't required to pick objects from their place of birth -- some were inspired by treasured vacation spots -- but the idiosyncratic output reflects the diversity of a neighborhood made up of people from 60 nationalities			2
world expo @entity19 is a collaboration between the artist group @entity126 , @entity128 - based landscape architects @entity126 and @entity26 architects @entity130 - @entity130			1
@entity131 has masterminded some of the most ambitious and left field ideas in @entity23 , including a public swimming pool in the harbor and a plan to turn an incinerator into a ski slope			1
" with @entity19 , we had to find a way of utilizing the diversity in the local population , " says @entity139 of @entity130 - @entity130			1
" rather than just have the same @entity23 bench you will see in any other park , why not involve the local residents to source the best items from across the globe and almost create a world expo ? " a good example stands at the end of the @entity153 -- it 's a grassy mound with a small patch of naked , reddish soil			1
the soil comes from different towns of the @entity159 territories and was brought here by two young @entity23 women who traveled to the @entity162			2
i stand near the soil and use the smartphone app to watch a film about how the women used their hands , rocks and small plastic bags to gather the material			0
" when we travel as @entity159 , " says one of the the women , @entity179 , in the video , " we gather soil so you can take a piece of @entity176 back home to @entity26			0
" on this breezy morning , a group of schoolkids have gathered on top of the mound on an assignment to plot park objects on a world map as they explore the area			1
when their teacher gives them the go - ahead , they scamper down a slope covered in zebra - striped asphalt			0
the stripes lead to the asphalt - covered @entity196 , the second part of @entity19			2
local residents were initially irked when they found out grassy areas of the park would be paved over , but the @entity196 is the most visually exciting aspect of the project			2
judging by the crowds who gather here and take photos , it 's also one of the most engaging			0
other items here include a @entity211 fountain , chess tables from @entity213 and a giant plastic octopus from @entity215 that doubles as a slide			0
" the fountain on the @entity196 works incredibly because it 's star - shaped , " says @entity139			0
" when parents are watching their kids play in the water or sliding down the octopus , the parents are seated across from each other , so they end up talking together rather than just sitting in a circle looking away			0
" bulls and @entity10 boxing the final part of @entity19 is the @entity228 , complete with neon signs for a @entity231 hotel and a beauty shop in @entity233			1
it 's the most bustling part of @entity19 and takes the park right down to @entity22 's busiest street			1
teenage boys play - fight in the @entity10 boxing ring while daycare children sway on the @entity17 - inspired swing benches			1
@entity241 of the adjacent building have been painted red to match the color of the surface , but some the purple - tinted patches on the ground have faded			0
the area is due to be refurbised next year to enhance the color scheme and to make the surface more slip - resistant for pedestrians and cyclists			0
not all of @entity19 is resistant to wear , tear and the effects of time			2
some objects , such as the lone steel bull , feel incongruous and random			0
however , when seen as a whole , this strange bubble of world exposition and local community is a cohesive experience			1
there have been honors for @entity19 , including a nomination for the prestigious 2013 @entity266 architecture prize			2
its real triumph , however , lies in its ability to engage people in its surreal world , whether they 're chess players deep in contemplation on the @entity196 , moody teenage students having gym lesson at the @entity13 " muscle beach " or toddlers sliding down an octopus from @entity215 or an elephant from @entity5			2
@entity280 is a freelance journalist and author based in @entity23 who writes about all aspects of @entity284 culture			2
he previously spent six years in @entity285 working for the @entity286 .			0

@entity23 urban space is surreal , eclectic *mix* of objects from all over the world
