@entity1 , @entity0 -- almost 50 percent of the world 's primates are in danger of extinction , according to a report from an international conservation group that cites habitat destruction and hunting as the two greatest threats			1
the golden - headed lion tamarin has been brought back from the edge of extinction			2
the situation is especially dire in @entity16 , where the report says more than 70 percent of monkeys , apes , and other primates are classified as vulnerable , endangered , or critically endangered			1
" we 've raised concerns for years about primates being in peril , but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined , " said @entity21 , president of @entity22 and chairman of the @entity24			1
" tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause , but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas , even where the habitat is still quite intact , " he said			0
the report from @entity22 , issued at this week 's @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , looked at the world 's 634 kinds of primates , mankind 's closest relatives			1
@entity22 funded the review along with the @entity47 , @entity49 's @entity48 , and the @entity50 - based @entity24 , or @entity51			0
the report found that about 90 percent of primate species in @entity54 and @entity55 were at risk of extinction			1
populations of gibbons , leaf monkeys , langurs and other species had dwindled , the report said , because of " rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional @entity68 medicine and pets			1
" @entity70 , deputy head of the @entity71 , called the situation in southeast @entity16 terrifying			1
" to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is , quite frankly , unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date , " he said in a news release			0
great apes like gorillas and bonobos still faced challenges in @entity87 , the report said , but it was the smaller primates -- such as the red colobus monkey , with its striking white , black and rust - colored coat -- that could die out first			2
in @entity87 , 11 of the 13 kinds of red colobus monkeys assessed in the report were listed as critically endangered or endangered , and two may already be extinct , the report said			0
@entity99 's red colobus has not been seen in 25 years , and despite occasional sightings , no primatologist has recorded a living miss @entity103 's red colobus since 1978 , the report says			2
primates are important to the health of their surrounding ecosystems , the report 's authors say , supporting a wide range of plant and animal life in the world 's tropical forests			1
healthy forests , in turn , provide vital resources for local human populations			0
reforestation is crucial to restoring primate populations because it restores their habitat , the report said			2
it cites the cases of the black lion tamarin and golden lion tamarin in @entity127 , which were downgraded from critically endangered to endangered after three decades of conservation efforts			0
" if you have forests , you can save primates , " said @entity129 , a scientist with @entity22 and the deputy chair of the @entity24			0
" the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates , but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change			0

situation is especially dire in @entity16 , where 70 percent of primates threatened
