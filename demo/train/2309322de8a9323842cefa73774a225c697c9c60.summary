-- in the crowded slums of @entity3 , @entity4 , untreated sewage mingles with the chaotic network of pipes that deliver water to the city			1
those who ca n't afford a local borehole or a private vendor know better than to take their chances with the taps -- most preferring to go thirsty instead			2
that 's according to @entity15 , a @entity3 microbiologist and inventor who has lived in the city all his life			1
but now @entity15 thinks he 's found a solution -- one that not only tackles the slums ' sanitation issues , but creates free , clean energy in the process			1
" with a cheap retrofit , household septic tanks -- the source of the sewage -- can be converted into biogas generators , " said @entity15 , 29 , whose concept has earned him a @entity28 fellowship , a @entity29 and growing international acclaim			1
" the idea of turning waste into energy has been around for centuries			2
my innovation is simply applying the chemistry in a practical way by using the resources we already have , " he explained			2
in most homes in @entity3 , toilet waste is stored in rudimentary septic tanks beneath the ground			1
here it decomposes into a poisonous compound , before being sucked out by a tanker that deposits it all in a nearby lagoon			0
" unfortunately , the system of water pipes is very disorganized , and they often pass through the same place where the sewage is dumped , " said @entity15			1
" and it 's not uncommon for poorly constructed septic tanks to leak directly into the drainage system			1
" but rather than attempt a wholesale overhaul of @entity4 's waste system , @entity15 's approach makes use of the existing septic tanks -- equipping them with new waste entry pipes that remove oxygen from the decaying process			1
as he explained : " when excreta decompose with oxygen , it creates a useless , incombustible mixture that carries disease			0
but without oxygen , the germs die and the mixture produces a combustible gas			0
" this biogas -- a mix of carbon dioxide and methane -- can be stored in an adjacent underground chamber and used to power cooking stoves , heat homes or even generate electricity			1
opinion : tackling climate change still a luxury in developing world " converting waste into biogas is a win - win strategy , " said @entity91 , founding director of the @entity92 , an organization that champions local energy innovations around the world			1
" what makes it so elegant is that it resolves a life - threatening sanitation issue -- by treating harmful , waterborne germs -- while simultaneously creating a much - needed source of carbon - free energy , " she said			2
@entity91 added that recent figures from the @entity105 say 1.4 billion people worldwide have no access to electricity , while 2.7 billion still prepare food on grossly inefficient and carbon - hungry open fires			0
" we have seen similar projects in places like @entity114 and @entity115 -- where everything from domestic garbage to animal waste has been used to produce energy with great success ... clearly this is the time to embrace domestically produced biogas , especially in the developing world			2
" it 's a view shared by the @entity124 ( @entity124 )			0
@entity125 is program officer for sustainable consumption and production at @entity124 's regional office for @entity129			0
he says that in areas where there is " little funding , capacity or infrastructure " for complex waste management , " we see the production of biogas as having great potential			2
" at present , @entity125 says the gas is regularly produced in just a handful of @entity129 nations			0
" in @entity146 , for instance , the prisons have been fitted with large biogas generators , so that they are almost entirely self - powering , " he said			1
but , although @entity15 's retrofitted biogas generator is relatively cheap to build -- requiring only low - tech materials such as plastic pipes , cement and sand -- and despite all the recognition it 's attracted , only a prototype has been installed so far			1
yet @entity15 conservatively estimates that the average street in @entity3 could produce 1,720 liters of biogas a day -- enough for an engine - powered water pump to serve the daily domestic needs of at least 50 families			1
so what 's the hold - up ? " biogas generators tend to be constructed in situ , " said @entity91 , " and while the materials are relatively cheap , they 're not mass - produced like solar panels or wind - turbines so , at present , it 's difficult to scale - up			1
" @entity15 has a different take , however			0
for him , it 's not an issue of resources or need , but attitude			0
" although i 've been filmed by government tv and won these awards , no politician has approached me to build anything			0
in @entity4 there is a lot of talk but very little walk , " he lamented			0
there is also a problem of credibility , he said			0
in @entity15 's experience , the hardest place to be taken seriously as a @entity4 inventor is in @entity4 itself			2
" it is a new concept for many @entity4 , " he said			0
" there 's still this feeling that unless an idea or a piece of new technology comes from the @entity198 , then it 's not glamorous ... it 's not valid			0

microbiologist says he has simple solution to sanitation problems in @entity3
conversion of septic tanks to biogas generators treats sewage and generates power
despite recognition , inventor says there are still cultural and political *barriers* to development
