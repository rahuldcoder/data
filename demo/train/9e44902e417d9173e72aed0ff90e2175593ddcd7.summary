-- @entity1 attended his brother - in - law 's funeral along with his daughter , @entity4 , six years ago			1
he never dreamed it would be the last day of his daughter 's life			2
" it 's so tragic , just not something you would never , ever expect , " said @entity1			2
instead of going home to the @entity15 suburb of @entity16 after the funeral , @entity11 , 18 , spent the night with her cousins			1
that night , she made a deadly decision			0
she took an @entity19 -- a single prescription pill -- that her cousin offered to her while drinking			1
she went to sleep that night and never woke up			0
she died of respiratory depression -- she simply stopped breathing			1
the @entity19 that @entity4 took belonged to her uncle , who had died of cancer			1
while taking one pill and dying is rare , dying accidentally after using painkillers inappropriately is common			1
according to the @entity29 , one person dies from a drug overdose every 19 minutes			0
about 28,754 @entity31 died after accidentally overdosing on legal or illegal drugs in 2009 , according to the @entity29 ; about half of those deaths involved prescription painkillers			1
those numbers are significant enough to make prescription drugs one of the leading causes of accidental death in this county			1
it 's a statistic that has led some experts to call prescription drug abuse an epidemic			1
@entity46 : let 's end the prescription drug death epidemic " if you asked any guy on the street what the leading cause of accidental death is , they would guess gunshot or car accident , " said @entity49 , co-founder of the @entity50 , a nonprofit organization advocating for improvements in substance abuse policies			2
" they would never imagine it 's pharmaceutical opioids ( painkillers )			2
" @entity65 -- the president and ceo of @entity67 , which represents and lobbies on behalf of drug manufacturers -- said @entity31 's problem with prescription drugs is unacceptable			2
but he insisted the drugs are safe when used as recommended			0
" the problem we 're dealing with with prescription drug abuse is having to balance those patients ( who abuse prescription drugs ) and those millions of patients that benefit from these medicines because they have a need that they and their physicians have recognized , " @entity65 said			1
@entity11 was on the road to recovery after a 2002 diagnosis of thyroid cancer and undergoing three surgeries to fight it			1
she and her cousin had done " a bit of drinking " the night she died , @entity1 said			1
but he is sure that had she not taken the @entity19 , she would still be alive today			0
" i 've never tried to make it sound like @entity4 is innocent , " @entity1 said			0
" what i want people to understand about @entity4 's tragedy is how easily this can happen , how dangerous these drugs are			0
" ' you play @entity99 roulette ' the prescription painkiller @entity11 took is a respiratory depressant that slows breathing			1
that in combination with the alcohol , another respiratory depressant , overwhelmed her brain , which stopped giving her heart and lungs the signal to keep functioning			0
" in many ways , you play @entity99 roulette , " said @entity112 , a senior researcher for the @entity50 , who added that adolescents and young adults are particularly at risk because they feel invincible			0
" you have no idea the ( respiratory ) consequences of any one group of substances , and then you put all that together and the risks go up exponentially			0
" it 's not just an issue among teenagers			0
in fact , rates of accidental overdose among teens , while still a major public health problem , are actually going down			0
this problem spans many demographics			0
@entity46 : the truth about prescription medication addiction in fact , males in their 40s and 50s who start off with a prescription for back pain and die from an accidental overdose several years later are dying in significant numbers			1
" could you imagine , a worker that popped their back , and we started to put them on ( pain ) medication and three years later they were dead ? " dr. @entity152 , the chief of pain medicine at the @entity154 , told @entity0			1
" the devastation began for @entity157 when he got a prescription for nerve pain radiating through his leg and back			1
it started when he was 28			0
for the next nine years , the @entity165 man endured the pain			1
it was not until 2005 , when @entity157 was 37 , that a doctor prescribed hydrocodone to address his pain , along with clonazepam , a benzodiazepine and anti-anxiety medication , to relieve his injury - related anxiety			1
family members said it was the first time in nearly a decade @entity157 felt relief from the life - altering pain he endured			1
but that relief was short - lived			0
in a journal entry , @entity157 said of the drugs , " at first they were a lifeline			1
now they are a noose around my neck			0
" it is a common sentiment , and a common scenario , according to @entity190 , who says @entity157 's case is far too common -- a person genuinely needs opioids but becomes addicted to the relief they provide			1
" the person that is on them for legitimate reasons and the kid who experiments with them seem very different , but the outcome is the same , " said @entity190			0
" and they are very difficult to get off of			0
i think we probably need to do a better job of pain management in this country			2
" by 2009 , @entity157 had sunk into dependence and , eventually , into addiction			1
at the advice of his family , he enrolled in two addiction treatment programs and seemingly had a handle on his addiction			2
but in july of 2011 , just 45 days after completing the final stage of his rehabilitation , @entity157 relapsed and died at 43			1
@entity157 still had outstanding prescriptions for hydrocodone and clonazepam at the time of his death , and empty prescription bottles were in his house when the police arrived			1
his official cause of death was mixed drug toxicity caused by opiates and benzodiazepines			0
a medical investigator said there was no way to tell what @entity157 ingested immediately before his death			1
like @entity11 , @entity157 stopped breathing in his sleep			1
@entity46 : more is not always better in medicine experts : better communication needed accidental prescription drug overdoses is " the only epidemic that i know that has been recognized by the @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity29 and the @entity245 , " @entity49 said			1
@entity190 and @entity49 believe the key to combating accidental deaths related to prescription drugs is creating a better dialogue among doctors , patients and pharmacies			1
" when someone is given prednisone , a steroid commonly used to treat inflammatory diseases , they are given very specific instructions , " said @entity190			0
" they are very direct about what will happen if the patient misuses it			0
you do n't see that with pain medication			2
" maybe if we did a better job with how we communicate the effects of prescription medications when you do n't take them the way they are prescribed or if you mix other substances with them , maybe we would n't have the number of people who are in crisis , " she added			2
after co-founding the @entity50 , @entity49 worked as the deputy director of the @entity280 for the @entity282 administration			0
one of his main tasks was combating the epidemic of prescription drug abuse			2
@entity49 says he believes everyone throughout the supply chain of opioids needs to take greater responsibility			0
this means pharmaceutical companies would carefully monitor and control the supply they produce , he said			0
doctors would be more rigorous with patient screening -- including , possibly , urinalysis exams before issuing or extending a prescription			1
patients would be more careful about the storing and disposal of their medications along with how they take them			2
and , most importantly , pharmacies would keep a watchful eye on all of the substances each of their customers takes , he said			2
" you do n't want to stop the use of opioids , because that would be stupid , but you need better management , " he said			0
" information exchange is the main thing ; pharmacies have to know what everyone is getting prescribed			2
" meanwhile , people such as @entity1 are left to deal with the aftermath of prescription drug abuse			2
after his daughter 's death , @entity1 began researching what he could do to prevent a similar tragedy from striking another household			0
in 2007 , @entity1 joined forces with other bereaved families to create advocates for the @entity328 , a group dedicated to advancing the dialogue around prescription drugs and the legislation concerning them			1
" it 's just so frustrating when you 're operating in an arena where there 's always a presumption of guilt , " @entity1 said			0
" this is n't about ( @entity4 ) being guilty or what kind of person she was			0
it happens that she was the most wonderful person i 've ever known			0
it 's really about how we can address this problem			0
