@entity0 , @entity1 -- during the summer months , in the arid , subtropical coastal plains of the @entity1 , temperatures rise to 40 celsius plus -- while average rainfall is a desolate four inches a year			1
and yet , in the years since the discovery of vast oil reserves in the late 1950s , a forest of skyscrapers , luxury apartments , verdant green gardens and golf courses has risen from the sand			0
it 's been made possible only with recourse to unimaginably large amounts of water			2
indeed , at 550 liters a day , @entity1 consume more per head of population than anyone else on earth			1
" it just evaporates very , very quickly , " explains @entity23 , ceo of the @entity24			0
" then when you add the lifestyle requirements -- the giant swimming pools ; the cooling systems ; the big gardens that need irrigating four times a day ... it goes some way to explain why the water consumption is so high			1
" with scarce native freshwater supplies , @entity23 says the oil - rich nation spends hundreds of million of dollars a year purifying coastal seawater			2
for a country that , according to @entity41 , boasted over $ 74 billion crude - oil export revenue in 2010 , the financial burden may seem relatively light			2
but the cost to the climate , says @entity23 , is certainly not			0
" desalination requires a lot of power ... we estimate that about four tonnes of carbon are emitted per million gallons of freshwater produced here , " he says , with reference to the energy - intensive process of removing salt from seawater ( see factbox )			1
to put that figure in context , @entity23 says that the energy required to pump freshwater from underground ( which , he says , is the most common source of drinking water in the @entity65 ) typically produces just over 1.5 tonnes of co2 per million gallons			0
read related : from polluter to protector : the @entity1 's ' @entity70 ' while large - scale desalination is not uncommon in those parts of the world where natural water resources are scarce -- such as @entity75 and @entity76 -- the @entity1 is by some margin , according to @entity23 , the industry 's most active player			1
in fact , 50 % of all the world 's desalination takes place in the @entity83			2
the @entity85 desalination plant in @entity0 has a freshwater generation capacity of 492 million liters a day , making it the biggest single producer on the planet , according to @entity23 , who notes that it " totally dwarfs anything found in the @entity65			1
" for dr @entity92 , of the @entity93 , this spells trouble for the future			0
" if we do n't conserve our water ... i fear about our resources in the future for the next generation , " he says			0
however , standing in one of the country 's 30 solar plants -- overlooked by sand dunes on all sides , @entity92 tells @entity2 that he hopes that solar technology may eventually offer a viable alternative energy source to power the @entity1 's huge desalination needs			1
" there are no carbon emissions while using photovoltaic cells to produce electricity -- then ( we can ) use electricity to operate desalination plants to produce freshwater , " he predicts			1
but on this point @entity23 is not convinced : " at the moment , solar panels are not fit for purpose in the @entity1 ... the dust and the sand in the atmosphere prevent ( sun ) rays from hitting the panels efficiently ... and the high temperatures also reduce performance , " he says			0
" for me , solar is not the answer			0
" instead , @entity23 believes that the most practical solution is for the desalination process to become more energy efficient , in conjunction with an effort by the @entity1 themselves to curb their " lavish " water consumption habits			1
" there is almost no regulation concerning water or power use , no minimum standards for water - consuming appliances ... and very few energy requirements for buildings , " he laments			0
" whatever we do , from now on it has to be cost - effective , lean and clean			0

@entity1 consumes 550 liters of water per head each day -- more than any other country
with no fresh water supplies , it depends on carbon - intensive desalination process
