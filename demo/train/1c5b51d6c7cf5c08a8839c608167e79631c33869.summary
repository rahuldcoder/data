it 's hard not to wonder how one can elbow into the art market for a piece of the pie			1
for those outside of the @entity3 art scene , entering the market can be intimidating			1
with reports surfacing in recent years on forgery , fraud , and money laundering , the art game seems even harder to play			1
" the art market is not very transparent , " admits @entity18 , founder of online art gallery @entity20			1
but he , and several other experts we spoke to , offer some insight on how to see clearly inside the @entity3 art market , with tips on the hottest works to buy right now			1
dig deep " @entity3 art is a jungle , " says @entity18			1
navigating the wild terrain requires patience and passion , especially if the buyer is unfamiliar with @entity3 history and culture			1
start at regional art fairs , such as @entity37 @entity36 , or @entity38 , where a lot of artists can be seen all at once			1
if you find yourself thinking about a work long after you 've seen it , approach the gallery and go deeper			0
look at many works from the artist 's entire career			0
" some collectors never buy without meeting with the artist , " says @entity18			1
when it comes to valuating the works , there are plenty of online resources			0
websites like @entity56 , artprice.net , and artvalue.com offer information about an artist 's auction records and previous owners			0
it also pays to see who is your competitor			1
if institutional investors , museums , art funds , or other private collectors are also buying this artist , that 's a plus			1
calligraphy , photography , but not @entity72 when looking for undervalued @entity3 art as an investment , start with ink and brush paintings made by artists born after the 1970s			1
" contemporary ink paintings are a good buy			1
some are very , very affordable , " says @entity82 's @entity81 art expert @entity80 - seen @entity83			1
" also @entity81 have always valued traditional calligraphy			0
you can find good works from $ 10,000 to $ 1 million			0
" @entity18 on the other hand suggests @entity3 video art and photography , both offering a small number of good contemporary artists , but with a great potential to grow in value and interest			1
he also points out that the days of kitsch art with @entity98 imagery are over			1
contemporary artists , such as @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102 were born after the @entity103 and do not focus overtly on politics as their predecessors did			0
" they are not what you would typically think of as ' @entity3 , ' " says @entity18			1
it 's a gamble if you can afford it , entering the market at the higher end will likely bring a larger return on your investment			1
@entity18 says it is quite rare not to make a profit on blue chips works that go for more than $ 1 million , like @entity118 or @entity119			2
buying more affordable pieces , around the $ 10,000 mark , has the potential for the largest return , but it 's risky			0
" unless you have inside information , it 's like buying a lottery ticket , " says @entity18			0
at the end of the day , do n't be too speculative			0
" i would not recommend a client to buy a young artist who suddenly became super famous			2
it 's too high risk			2
prices can fall quickly again			0
start with a mid-range artist			0
it 's more value proof , " says art world lawyer @entity136			2
auction dos and don'ts " the art market is not very transparent			2
the secondary art market ( auctions ) is even less so , " says @entity18			2
auction first - timers must set a budget and a theme for themselves			2
after the bidding starts , best sit on your hands when the budgeted price is surpassed			0
@entity82 's @entity153 warns against impulse buying , which she calls " a serious mistake			0
" for more experienced buyers though , she recommends being ruthless : " spend beyond your means , reach as far as you can get , and always go for the better piece			0
otherwise you 'll regret it			0
" protect your interests " the art world has by tradition been based on gentlemen 's agreements , " says @entity136 , he founded the company @entity167			2
" but the market has become more international and includes more money today than before , so it 's important to protect your interests			0
" at the very least , request a certificate of authenticity when purchasing a work , and have it signed by the artist			0
if you are buying from a third party or reseller , it is also a good idea to ask for a proof of purchase from the artist , or gallery representing the artist			0
keep all e-mail , receipts and details that can prove a legitimate transaction for when you want to resell the art in the future			2
sometimes your gut feeling will also tell you when you 're being lured into an unreliable sale			0
" for me it 's very important that the gallery manager likes art , " says @entity136			2
" if they immediately start talking about art as an investment , it 's a big turn - off			1
" golden rule although everybody interviewed for this article offered different advice , all agreed on this : to make a good art investment you have to enjoy art. " do you want the piece of art on your wall ? if not , do n't buy it , " says @entity136			1
" it does n't matter if you know much about art or not , you must enjoy it			2
otherwise it 's like collecting wine without drinking it			0

new to @entity3 art ? remember the mantra : ***research*** , ***research*** , ***research***
blue - chip always pays , so buy high , sell high -- if you can afford it
*maoist* kitsch is so over , be adventurous and look for new media , video , and photography
