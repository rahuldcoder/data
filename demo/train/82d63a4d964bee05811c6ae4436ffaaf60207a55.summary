@entity1 , @entity0 -- as @entity4 took to the sodden track of last week 's @entity6 in nuerburgring he went where one @entity4 had been before , his father @entity8			1
@entity9 ( left ) gets a pep talk from his world championship - winning father at this year 's @entity13 @entity4 junior 's first grand prix -- and possibly last for some time , now that @entity16 ' vacated @entity18 seat has gone to @entity19 -- will be talked about for years to come			1
his decision to run on extreme wet tires on lap three saw him leading the race by 33 seconds before the race was suspended for the second time			2
and , although his race ended with hydraulic failure , and future drives in @entity28 are by no means certain , he joins the rare club of drivers who have led a grand prix on their first race			1
it was at @entity36 that his father @entity8 raced his last @entity28 grand prix			1
never a contender -- he scored only two points from 47 starts -- he was nevertheless a popular driver with the home crowd			0
sadly , eleven days after the @entity42 at @entity36 , @entity4 was killed driving a @entity43 956 at a @entity45 event in @entity46 , @entity47			1
@entity8 's brothers @entity48 and @entity50 were also racing drivers ; @entity48 entered seven grands prix in the 1989 season but did not pre-qualify , so did n't race			2
" my father did his last @entity28 race at the @entity36 and now i 'm doing my first , " said @entity4 last sunday , " that is something special			1
" underneath his @entity18 overalls , @entity4 wore a chain around his neck , as he always does when racing			2
on it was the wedding ring belonging to the father who died when @entity4 when only five years old -- a good luck talisman given to him by his mother			1
@entity28 1 's history has many such tales of sons following fathers into racing careers -- and in some cases the second generation drivers lost their fathers at an early age			1
fatalities have been so rare in @entity28 in the last two decades that it 's easy to forget quite how dangerous an activity it once was			1
@entity47 @entity78 had celebrated his eleventh birthday a month before his father @entity80 , the legendary @entity81 driver , died in practice before the @entity83 at @entity84			0
such was his status in @entity47 , that his remains were returned to his homeland aboard a jet of the @entity89 , on the request of the government			0
knowing the dangers inherent in the sport , @entity78 junior entered @entity28 in 1996			2
he started his first race from pole position and just missed out on the top step of the podium to his @entity100 team - mate , @entity99			0
in his next season @entity78 junior achieved what his father rightly should have done , he won the @entity104			0
@entity99 too was the son of a racing legend			0
@entity106 was champion in 1962 and 1968			0
with the dashing demeanor , and pencil moustache , of a @entity110 flying ace , he projected an image of the true sporting brit			0
but , behind the scenes , he was a tempestuous man who could be both vain and reckless			0
@entity106 died in 1975 , when @entity99 was 15			0
it is often assumed that the sons of famous drivers who follow their fathers into the sport are drifted into their seats on a wave of nepotism and inheritance			0
not true of @entity99 , who had to work as a motorcycle courier in @entity1 to pay for his start in motor racing			0
@entity106 did n't die racing			0
he died trying to land a @entity129 airplane in fog			0
the plane was not properly registered or insured and @entity99 died along with his five passengers ( including @entity133 , who was racing for @entity99 's @entity28 team at the time )			1
the families of the bereaved had no choice but to sue the estate of @entity106 for compensation			0
another @entity28 champion to sire a racing son was @entity144 @entity143			1
he won the 1978 world championship for @entity146 and also having a successful career in the @entity144 oval circuits in both @entity149 and @entity150			0
his son @entity151 entered @entity28 in 1993 , paired with @entity152 at @entity153			1
but , despite his success in @entity149 , @entity143 junior failed to make an impression in @entity28 and was replaced , after just 13 races , by @entity158			2
he would be the last @entity144 to compete in @entity28 until the appearance of @entity160 in 2006			2
the current @entity28 grid contains one @entity28 - sibling and one f1 - offspring			2
@entity165 , of course , is brother to seven - times world @entity151 ( and living proof that driving talent is n't necessarily inherited )			0
and @entity100 driver @entity9 is the son of @entity169 , the @entity170 driver who won the world championship for @entity100 in 1982			2
three - time world champion @entity173 's son , @entity174 raced for @entity173 and @entity175 in 1990 and 1994 without ever scoring points			1
and two - time champion @entity178 's son @entity177 raced for three seasons in the early 1990s , scoring a total of 12 championship points			1
are there other sons - of - champions waiting in the wings ? @entity186 , son of @entity187 the 1979 world champion , tested for @entity189 in 2001 but was fired			1
he now races in the @entity192 series and looks an unlikely @entity28 contender			2
1992 world champion @entity194 has supported the racing careers of sons @entity197 and @entity198 , who have both raced in single - seat racing formulae but , again , without looking obvious @entity28 contenders ( though @entity198 is only 19 )			1
and four - time world champion @entity202 's son @entity201 has had some success in the feeder formulae but , at 25 , is considered old compared with young blood such as @entity206 and @entity207			1
@entity209 , son of three - time championship winner , @entity208 is a test driver for @entity212			0
