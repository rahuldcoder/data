@entity0 -- the @entity2 has rejected an appeal over a federal law banning felons from having bulletproof vests or body armor			1
the 7 - 2 decision on monday not to intervene was a reaffirmation of congressional authority over a wide range of commerce			1
the order was one of several hundred pending appeals the court summarily disposed of by the court			2
by refusing to accept the case for review , the justices let stand the conviction of @entity22 , a @entity23 man who was stopped by police in 2005 on suspicion of selling cocaine			2
officers then discovered he was wearing a bulletproof vest			0
that in itself did not violate state law , but because @entity22 was an ex-felon -- convicted of armed robbery in 1999 -- and the vest was manufactured in @entity34 , he was convicted under federal law			1
he was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison			0
@entity37 had passed the law in 2002 in response to a series of high - profile shootings involving police , including bank robbers wearing body armor			1
@entity22 's lawyers argued owning such equipment had nothing to do with interstate commerce , and that @entity37 had no power to intervene			1
" the federal power claimed is the authority to regulate anything -- from possession of french fries to the local theft of a @entity59 's kiss , " his lawyers told the high court			0
opponents of the sweeping health care reform law promoted by president @entity62 have made similar arguments , saying constitutional authority by the government has been improperly exceeded			1
in particular , nearly a dozen states and private groups have challenged a provision of the law requiring @entity70 to have some form of health insurance by 2014 or pay a tax penalty			1
justices @entity74 and @entity76 strongly dissented from the court 's refusal to intervene in the @entity22 case			1
" today , the court tacitly accepts the nullification of our recent @entity84 jurisprudence , " wrote @entity74 in a seven - page dissent			1
the court 's failure to step in " threatens the proper limits on @entity37 's commerce power and may allow @entity37 to exercise police powers that our constitution reserves to the states , " he said			0
the case is @entity22 v. @entity70 ( 09 - 1555 )			1
in other pending cases : the justices let stand the criminal conviction of an @entity100 man who was found guilty despite votes from two jurors to acquit him			1
at issue was whether the @entity104 requires a unanimous jury verdict to convict a person of a felony			1
@entity100 and @entity108 alone among states allow criminal convictions by non-unanimous verdicts in some crimes			1
@entity113 was convicted by a 10 - 2 jury vote in 2008 for unauthorized use of a vehicle -- borrowing a friend 's car and not bringing it back			1
he served 13 months behind bars			0
the case is @entity113 v. @entity100 ( 10 - 344 )			1
the justices rejected for a second time the appeal of an outspoken figure in the " birther " movement involving whether president @entity62 is in fact a @entity70 citizen			1
attorney @entity127 has been challenging a $ 20,000 fine imposed by a federal judge who determined the @entity34 attorney had filed a frivolous lawsuit			0
@entity127 had represented capt. @entity131 , an @entity132 physician from @entity133 , @entity134 , who protested her pending deployment to @entity137			0
@entity127 had argued in court the deployment was illegal because @entity62 had no authority to act as commander in chief because he was unconstitutionally serving as president			0
a motion for a restraining order was ultimately rejected by judge @entity145			1
according to court records , @entity127 then filed for a rehearing , and publicly labeled the ruling an " act of treason			0
" @entity131 later said that second motion , which also was rejected , was filed without her consent			2
@entity152 then ruled the lawyer had filed " frivolous " litigation , had abused the civil judicial process , and fined her			0
the high court in august had rejected a similar motion for relief from @entity127			2
the justices had also dismissed earlier , unrelated lawsuits from individuals questioning @entity62 's citizenship			0
state birth certificate records show he was born august 4 , 1961 , in @entity165 , @entity166			0
his mother is a native of @entity168 ; his father was born in @entity170			0
among the claims of various " birther " movement organizers are that the president was born in @entity170 or @entity174 ; that his birth certificate is a forgery ; and that he had dual @entity70 - @entity178 citizenship at birth because of his father 's @entity170 heritage and therefore is not a " natural born " citizen , as is required to be eligible for president under the @entity70 @entity104			1
the case is @entity127 v. @entity185 ( 10 - 541 )			2
and the high court said no to the claims of a @entity189 inmate who wanted to grow his hair long behind bars , for what he said were a necessary part of his religious rights			0
@entity195 , a 66 - year - old practitioner of @entity189 shaminism , also claimed @entity198 corrections officials denied him the right to wear a colored headband and to use a pipe in his cell as part of his tribal ceremonies			2
at issue was whether a prison grooming rule violated a federal law protecting the rights of prisoners to religious practice			2
the inmate claims corrections staff has harassed him about his religion , confiscating his medicine bag , religious medallion , and quartz crystal			0
according to @entity195 , an altercation with a guard four years ago resulted him being denied the right to conduct pipe ceremonies in his cell , or being allowed to have musical instruments			0
the opinion says it does allow the man to wear a plain white headband			0
@entity195 is serving a 99 - year prison term for robbery , rape , kidnapping and attempted escape			2
the @entity231 native says in his legal filings he is " @entity233 and @entity234 ( shaman ) of the @entity236			0
" lower federal courts have had differing views over the level of deference owed by prison officials to inmate religious practices that conflict with grooming rules			0
the @entity62 administration had recommend the court turn aside the appeal , which it did without comment			2
the case is @entity195 v. @entity250 ( 09 - 1353			2

@entity74 and @entity76 dissent from rejection of appeal on felons owning body armor
the @entity2 turns aside a challenge to a law allowing less - than - unanimous guilty verdicts
another appeal from a " birther " also is rejected
