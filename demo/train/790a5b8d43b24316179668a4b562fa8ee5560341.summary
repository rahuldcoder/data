@entity0 -- murder and justice have always been hallmarks of the " @entity5 " stable of tv shows , but never before have the fictional @entity8 crimes guided the show 's detectives and attorneys to the @entity0 -- until now			1
" @entity5 : @entity13 " co-star @entity12 says the show 's intent is to " shine light in the dark places			2

@entity52 - nominated actor @entity12 , who plays detective @entity53 on the show , explained that the intent behind the issues raised on the program has always been to " shine light in the dark places that no one wants to go or talk about because there 's usually a lot of shame and denial about it			2
" @entity12 described how the @entity0 episode " really does kind of revolve around child soldiers , how they 've been brainwashed , the horrible journeys that they 've had to endure and how they can be assimilated back and be productive			1
and i think in this particular episode , we 're trying to carry on with whatever clout we may possess			0
we have the medium to shine the light out there and tell this story			0
" considering the " ripped - from - the - headlines " and complicated themes regarding conflict in @entity80 and the @entity47 , " @entity22 " writers and actors relied on @entity83 co-founder @entity82 as a consultant throughout the filming			2
the @entity83 is an advocacy group committed to preventing genocide , crimes against humanity and other atrocities in six historically tumultuous @entity80 nations			1
@entity82 explained that he perceived the episode as " one where reality dovetailed quite neatly with fiction , and hopefully more people will understand now what is happening in real life with president @entity97 and @entity98 , and then the accountability for war crimes because they saw it on ' @entity5			0
' " on march 4 , the @entity47 indicted @entity98 's president , @entity97 , with war crimes and crimes against humanity			0
this was the first time such charges have been leveled against a sitting head of state			0

@entity122 , director of the @entity0 's outreach initiative , elaborated : " we 're starting a program where we 're going to say to filmmakers , people who produce television series , that we are essentially open for business			1

we 'll make it happen			0
" in addition to the " @entity5 " film shoot , the @entity0 has hosted two other high - profile events in march through the initiative			1

topics included abortion , suicide bombings and post-conflict resolution			0
@entity140 summed up the purpose of the occasion , saying , " much like the fictional ships and planets in the ' @entity154 ' universe , the @entity0 is an imperfect place , but the fight for justice , equality and understanding remains fundamental to both			2

i have a great job , but really all i want to do is actually work in the @entity0 i 'm pretty excited to be here			0
