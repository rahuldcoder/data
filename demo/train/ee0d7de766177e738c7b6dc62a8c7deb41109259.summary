the next time you find yourself facing some questionable drinking water , look for some cilantro			1
at least that 's what a team of @entity6 and @entity7 researchers made up of undergraduate students suggest			0
the research team , lead by @entity12 of @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , along with colleagues from the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity7 , have been studying the region of @entity20 near @entity21 to identify cheaper ways to filter water			1
@entity21 has long dumped its waste water in the valley , and the contaminated water is then used by regional farmers to irrigate crops			1
once in the edible foods , heavy metals such as lead and nickel can make their way to consumers , where they can contribute to neurological and other health problems			1
" the organic toxins we can take care of pretty easily with a number of different methods , but the only way to really get rid of those heavy metals is to treat them with filtering agents like activated charcoal ( like what 's found in a @entity50 filter ) , but those types of materials are kind of expensive , " says @entity12			1
" they are a little expensive for us to use , but they are very expensive to the people living in that region			0
" @entity57 : hazardous haze after testing various samples of plants from cacti to flowers , the researchers determined that cilantro is the most prevalent and powerful so - called bioabsorbant material in the area			1
@entity67 is the scientific term for using organic materials often found in plants , that when dried , could replace the charcoal currently used in filters			0
the team suspects that the outer wall structure of the tiny cells that make up the plant are ideal for capturing metals			2
other plants , like dandelions and parsley may also provide similar bioabsorbant capabilities			0
@entity12 says ground - up cilantro can be inserted into a tube into which water is passed through			2
the cilantro allows the water to trickle out but absorbs metals , leaving cleaner drinking water			2
dried cilantro can also be placed into tea bags that are placed in a pitcher of water for a few minutes to suck out the heavy metals			1
" it 's something they already have down there , it takes minimal processing , and it 's just a matter of them taking the plants and drying them out on a rock in the sun for a couple of days , " says @entity12			0
because cilantro is n't an essential crop , using it as a purifier wo n't take away from people 's food needs in the region , and the relative ease with which the plant grows also makes it a realistic option for cleansing water			2
@entity57 : pollution in utero so far , the researchers reported success in removing lead and nickel with their cilantro filters , and are studying how well the herb can removed other heavy metals found in the @entity20 water such as arsenic and mercury			1
" we are hoping we can look at how cilantro absorbs those metals , and see if those metals work in some kind of synergy when they come into contact with the biomass , " says @entity12			0
" we need to look at mixtures of metals to see if cilantro evenly pulls all the metals out			0
" how much cilantro would it take to effective make contaminated water drinkable ? @entity12 says a handful of cilantro will nearly cleanse a pitcher full of highly contaminated water of its lead content			2
the researchers are presented their findings at the national meeting of the @entity150			0
