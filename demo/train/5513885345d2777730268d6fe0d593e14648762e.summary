-- when the world 's leading marathon runners bid to win @entity5 gold on sunday , they would do well to draw inspiration from one of the greatest athletes in the history of track and field			1
the 42 - kilometer race through the streets of @entity14 will mark the 60th anniversary of @entity17 's triumph at the @entity18 , which completed a triple which is unlikely to ever be repeated			1
the 29 - year - old @entity20 had already won the 5,000 and 10,000 meter golds and , remarkably , was running the marathon for the very first time			1
in a host country with a reputation for long - distance running -- @entity29 's former gold medal winners @entity27 and @entity30 had lit the @entity31 in 1952 -- @entity17 's amazing feat had added resonance , and the crowd chanted his name in unison as he ran into the stadium in splendid isolation			1
the winning time of two hours 23 minutes and two seconds was also his third world record of the @entity18 in just over a week			0
the closest any athlete has come to match @entity17 's triple was indeed a @entity43 , @entity44 , who won the 5,000 - 10,000 double at the @entity45 in @entity46 and finished fifth in the marathon			1
for modern - day distance runners , despite their advanced training techniques , the notion of running the @entity18 ' three longest running events in a little over a week would be out of the question -- especially with the men 's marathon coming just a day after the 5,000m at @entity56			1
golden couple @entity17 died in 2000 , aged 78 , but is still survived by his widow @entity58 , who also won the javelin event at the @entity18 , just minutes after her husband had burst clear of three rivals to take a dramatic 5,000m final			1
they were truly the golden couple of athletics , but had first met in their native @entity66 as both started to make their mark in their chosen sport			0
" i knew him before all the awards			0
and he always said it 's good we married because it was only after that that he won any of his medals , " @entity58 told @entity0			1
she still works actively to ensure @entity17 's legacy is never forgotten -- and supported @entity80 , who organized a special week of races to mark the 60th anniversary			1
" i wanted to call it ' @entity84 ' but i was n't allowed to use the word @entity84			2
so instead i called it ' @entity17 's @entity87 ' even though it 's over eight days , because in those eight days he won his medals , " @entity80 said			1
@entity17 was not a pretty runner , he ran with a tortured style , his head lolling from side to side , but he was a trendsetter , the first to really push the limits in training			2
he famously donned army boots to run in the winter snow and added weights for extra resistance			0
" it is at the borders of pain and suffering that the men are separated from the boys , " he once said			0
grueling sessions the harder he trained , the more success came -- and @entity17 was no man for half measures			2
by legend his most grueling session was to run 400 meters -- one lap of a conventional running track -- 100 times , all at speed			0
nearly a marathon on sprint efforts , so it was no wonder when he eventually ran the distance competitively he took it in his stride , asking the pre-race favorite , @entity120 of @entity121 , if they were running fast enough as they contested the lead			0
after bursting clear of @entity120 , the incredible @entity17 had energy enough to chat with journalists who were following the race by car			2
@entity58 put his ability to train and compete so ferociously down to his upbringing , taking up an apprenticeship at 14 after failing to make the academic grades to continue his studies			2
" he had a hard youth			0
he was working for the @entity136 shoe company and it was really hard , their training			0
and their philosophy was , ' when there is a barrier do n't go around it , go over it			0
' so this is the philosophy which characterizes @entity17 -- hard work and when you have a goal , solve it , do it , " she said			2
@entity151 was to prove the peak of his achievements , and by the time of the next @entity5 in @entity155 in 1956 other athletes , copying his training techniques and refining them , had come on the scene			2
@entity17 , nursing an injury , came sixth in the marathon behind his longtime rival and friend @entity162 of @entity163			1
eventual retirement he retired from competition the following year , but he continued to be involved in track and field , playing the generous host when visitors came to @entity170 to compete in races or to seek advice			0
@entity174 @entity173 , who broke 17 world records in the 1960s but never won a gold medal in a major championship , stayed with @entity17 and @entity58 and was treated to more than their legendary hospitality			1
@entity17 took him to the airport and as they said goodbye , pushed a parceled gift into @entity173 's hand			1
when he later opened it , @entity173 was dumbfounded -- it was one of @entity17 's golds from @entity151			1
this generosity of spirit and consideration for his fellow man extended to @entity17 's political beliefs			1
he was an outspoken supporter of the @entity192 , as the @entity20 government of @entity194 demanded freedoms while still a client state of the @entity197			0
after @entity197 tanks brought a bloody end to the reforms in 1968 , @entity17 was eventually stripped of his position as a colonel in the @entity20 army			1
as @entity58 recalled it was not an immediate demotion , because with the @entity206 taking place , @entity17 was in the media spotlight			1
national hero " right around the @entity84 he was a national hero , it was not possible for the government to punish him			2
but later during the @entity197 occupation he was working as a dustbinman			0
he got his punishment , " she said			0
after the @entity216 came down , @entity17 was reinstated to his former eminence by @entity20 president @entity218 in 1990			1
he lived out his days in the modest apartment he shared in @entity170 with his wife , suffering in his later years during a long period of ill health			2
in 1998 they celebrated their golden anniversary ; @entity17 asked @entity58 to marry him during the 1948 @entity56 where he had won gold in the 10,000 and silver over 5,000			1
by coincidence they shared the same birthday , september 19 , 1922 and his proposal was unique and typical of the man			0
" so , we were both born on the same day , " he told her			0
' " what if , by chance , we were also to get married on the same day ? ' " loved by millions , @entity17 sadly passed away at the turn of the century			0
his funeral in the @entity20 capital was attended by many leading figures from the world of sport			0
in his memory , the @entity241 commissioned a statue of @entity17 in the grounds of the @entity245 in @entity246 , @entity247			0
he is the only athlete to be so honored , and he surely deserved it .			0

@entity17 won three gold medals at 1952 @entity84 in @entity151
legendary @entity20 claimed the 5,000m , 10,000m and marathon treble
his wife @entity58 also won javelin gold in @entity151
