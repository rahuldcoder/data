-- @entity1 became the first @entity3 golfer in 43 years to win the @entity4 on sunday as @entity5 failed to conjure up a 43rd birthday present for himself			1
the @entity7 finished as runner - up at the tournament for the sixth time , while the 32 - year - old @entity11 ended his long wait for a major title as he triumphed by two shots after a tense final round in @entity16			1
@entity5 needed to birdie the last hole to force a playoff -- which no - one had managed during the final round -- but he ended up dropping a shot and tying for second with @entity23 's @entity22			1
@entity24 , who moved to @entity26 from @entity27 as a five - year - old , launched himself onto the golf scene when he finished fourth at the 1998 @entity30 as the leading amateur			0
however , he missed the cut in his first 21 tournaments as a professional and took time to find his way after losing his father and mentor @entity36 to cancer in 2002			0
" you saw me look to the heavens , with it being @entity42 -- i was just trying to remember my dad , " @entity11 told reporters			0
he became the second first - time major winner this season , following @entity23 @entity48 's victory at april 's masters , as he made up a two - shot deficit on @entity5 going into the final round			1
@entity5 made a terrible start , with two double - bogeys either side of a birdie within his opening five holes , and @entity11 had a share of the lead with day at the halfway stage			2
@entity5 regained the lead with a superb eagle at the par - four 10th , but @entity11 bounced back from a bogey with birdies at 12 and 13 before dropping back to level with his rival			1
however , @entity5 paid for a poor shot at 15 as he dropped back to two over and @entity11 responded with pars at 17 and 18 -- the latter chipping from off the green with a three - wood to give himself a tap - in for an even par round of 70			2
that left @entity5 needing to produce the kind of putting heroics that @entity11 displayed against him in last year 's decisive singles match at the @entity78 at @entity79 , but the left - hander will have to wait another year to win his national tournament -- having also been bridesmaid in 1999 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 and 2009			1
" very heartbreaking , " @entity5 said			0
" this is probably the toughest for me			0
" world no. 1 @entity83 endured his worst performance at the @entity4 since turning professional as he closed with 74 to be 13 over for the tournament -- his highest score when making the halfway cut			2
" there 's always a lesson to be learned in every tournament whether you win or lose , " said @entity83 , who had been seeking his fourth @entity4 win and 15th major overall			1
" i 'll look back at the things i did right and the things i did wrong			0
i did a lot of things right			0
unfortunately i did a few things wrong as well			0
