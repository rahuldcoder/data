now , as @entity9 lies in a hospital bed in @entity11 , @entity12 , the shock and outrage among her countrymen have given way to a new sentiment : what will the government do about this ? while the @entity1 news media debate how the country should respond to the attack , thousands of people nationwide have joined in rallies in support of the wounded 14 - year - old			1
@entity9 : global symbol , but still just a kid the shooting has prompted an unusually strong and united reaction of disgust and anger among many @entity1 , analysts say			1
" there is a groundswell of sympathy for her and also a very strong demand for the @entity1 state to do something about this issue , " said @entity34 , director of policy and programs at the @entity37 , a @entity1 research organization			0
much of the discontent is directed toward the @entity1 @entity4 , the extremist group that has claimed responsibility for the shooting and said it will seek to kill @entity9 if she recovers from her injuries			1
" this has created a very bad feeling for the @entity4 , " said @entity50 , an executive with a paper manufacturing company in the city of @entity53			0
@entity50 said he was " crying and weeping " after hearing of the attack on @entity9 , who had defied extremists in the northwestern @entity0 by insisting on the right of girls to go to school			1
@entity1 foreign minister @entity61 , the first woman to hold that job , said sunday that she thinks the shooting marked a " turning point " in the ferocity of how @entity1 goes after @entity4 offenders and extremist groups			1
" @entity1 , at the diplomatic , political and every level , has been asking ... to take this matter seriously , to not let them ( the @entity4 ) have a safe haven , " she said			1
meanwhile , police in @entity11 said " two well - wishers " were stopped when they came to the hospital overnight wanting to see the girl			0
no arrests were made , contrary to earlier reports from the hospital			0
hospital director @entity78 said the intruders were " probably people being over-curious , " but he added that the hospital is taking no chances and that tight security is in place			0
standing with @entity9 : teen inspires others to fight for education at a rally organized by the powerful @entity90 political party in @entity91 , thousands of people gathered , some waving flags and banners with messages of support for @entity9			2
" our prayers are with you , " read one			0
another said , " @entity9 -- ( an ) attack on you is an attack on education and progress			1
" social activist @entity105 said : " if @entity4 is a mindset , then @entity9 is a mindset , too			1
it 's a mindset of educated and empowered women			0
" another of those at the rally , @entity113 , said people " do n't want the @entity4 anymore in @entity1 , and after the @entity9 incident , it is time for people to stand up			1
" " the message is right here ... all these people			0
they are condemning the act of the @entity4 , " added student @entity121			0
the @entity4 , who operate in northwestern @entity1 along the border with @entity126 , have fallen foul of @entity1 public opinion in the past , notably in 2009 , when a video emerged of the flogging of a teenage girl in the @entity0			1
the video provoked appalled reactions in @entity1 at the time , but " the scale of protests for @entity9 are bigger , " said the @entity37 's @entity134			1
" even the right - wing mainstream media have expressed outrage			0
" the @entity4 became increasingly unpopular among @entity1 in 2009 as the military carried out an offensive against members of the group in northwestern areas			2
but the military operations failed to root them out altogether , and their continued influence in the region was demonstrated last week by the gun attack on @entity9 and two other girls as they were being driven home from school			1
the two other girls were less severely wounded than @entity9			2

the 16 - year - old girl is in the 10th grade			1
but despite the injury to her arm and the terror of the attack , @entity165 said she does not regret studying and hopes to continue			0
" girls ' education here is more important than boys ' because boys can have any jobs they want to but girls can not , " she said			0
" i want to tell all the girls to continue their mission to get an education			2
" interior minister @entity179 , visiting the three girls ' school in the town of @entity183 on tuesday , said the name would be changed from " @entity185 " to " @entity186			1
" a task force will be established to protect all girls ' schools in the region that are under threat of militants , he told reporters			0
" i am not only grieved , the whole nation is grieved , " he said			0
the hunt for those responsible has made " considerable progress , " @entity179 added , although he gave few details of the investigation			0

police chief @entity202 of the @entity0 said that 60 suspects are being detained , interrogated or investigated			2
" we have sufficient evidence to find the culprits , " the chief said			1
" soon we will catch them			0
" politicians and commentators in @entity1 have slammed the attack			2
but the condemnation of the @entity4 has not been as universal			0

the cricket star - turned - politician @entity220 , who visited @entity9 in a hospital in @entity223 last week , has drawn criticism for not condemning the @entity4 outright for the attack			1
@entity50 " showed a lot of concern but could n't resist bringing in the issue of the drone strikes as a cause for this attack , which was a bit of a deflection , " said @entity134 , referring to the drone attacks carried out by the @entity227 in northwestern @entity1 that have generated resentment in the country			2
certain commentators have also begun to question the official version of events , suggesting that the attack on @entity9 may be used as a pretext by the government for military action against the @entity4 in the restive tribal region of @entity245			1
@entity246 : millions face @entity9 's fight " the @entity9 incident is the @entity255 's latest attempt to divide public opinion and incite conflict in @entity1 society , " @entity249 , a contributor to the @entity1 daily @entity251 , wrote in a column tuesday			1

however , she faces reconstructive surgery and there is " still a long way to go , " said @entity78 , of the @entity270 in @entity11			0
her family is not yet in @entity12 to be by her bedside , but the @entity1 high commissioner is making arrangements on that front , he said			2
in the meantime , the 14 - year - old appears to be " every bit as strong as we had been led to believe , " @entity78 said , adding that the consultant leading her care " is impressed by her resilience and her strength			1
