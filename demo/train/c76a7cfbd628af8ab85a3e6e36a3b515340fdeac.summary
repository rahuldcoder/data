-- the brand name @entity2 no longer exists and its former founder @entity3 has left @entity4 after being freed from jail , but a landmark ruling in the @entity7 released monday ensures their legacy will live on during a sensitive period of time for @entity12			1
@entity2 was one of @entity4 's oil giants through the 1990s and until the early 2000s , when its assets were expropriated by the state after a political battle with @entity3			1
now the @entity21 , in what is considered a landmark judgment , has ordered payment of damages to its former shareholders , totaling $ 50 billion and including interest and fees for violation of a treaty covering @entity4 's energy assets			1
this case goes back to 2005 and strikes at the heart of @entity12 's tactics to strip @entity2 and @entity34 under charges of tax evasion			1
the three judge panel called the @entity39 's move " equivalent of expropriation of claimants ' investments			0
" those claimants , representing @entity44 or @entity45 , include former @entity2 ceo @entity46 and four others who were seeking damages of up to $ 114 billion			2
the main asset of @entity2 , known as @entity50 , was auctioned in late 2004 for just $ 9.3 billion and purchased by state - run @entity51 , which is now run by @entity12 confidant @entity52			1
the @entity4 president has big plans for @entity51 to be one of the top energy players in the world			1
it now has an enterprise value of $ 115 billion , but that is just a start with agreements signed with @entity63 , @entity64 of @entity65 and its largest shareholder @entity66 , which has a 20 % stake in the group			2
@entity51 holds the position that it did not participate in the arbitrations and therefore is not bound by the rulings			0
in a statement it said , " @entity51 believes that all of its purchases of former @entity2 assets , and all other actions taken by it with respect to @entity2 were entirely lawful and proper applicable law			1
" the response from @entity4 's foreign minister @entity81 during a press conference monday was equally unforgiving about the actions taken			2
" the process is not over ; appellations are allowed , " @entity81 said			0
" the @entity4 side , as well as agencies representing @entity4 in this trial will use all available legal possibilities to defend their stance			0
" this ruling comes as @entity91 faces intense scrutiny for its support of the ongoing fight by @entity96 rebels in eastern @entity97			0
another round of @entity100 economic sanctions are pending after @entity101 proceeded to tighten the noose earlier this month			0
@entity3 was not part of this case , but an attorney who represented the former oligarch during his trial on charges by the @entity4 state said the ruling serves as a partial vindication for his former client			2
according to @entity117 , " this is a very important decision to be read by all those who lose assets to autocrats			0
" the arbitrators , he said , had " very heroically " cut through " mistruths " to find in favor of the claimants			0
this ruling could not only influence @entity125 - led sanctions on @entity91 , but could potentially strain talks to find common ground between @entity4 , @entity97 and the @entity100 over future gas supplies into @entity129			1

a court decision awards $ 50 billion to now - *defunct* @entity4 oil giant @entity2 ' former shareholders
the case has been *rumbling* for almost a decade , after @entity2 assets were expropriate by the state
the *win* is seen as a blow to @entity4 president @entity12 , whose relations with the @entity125 are strained
