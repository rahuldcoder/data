-- a lockdown at @entity4 was lifted monday afternoon , hours after someone anonymously told a 911 dispatcher that his roommate was coming to the southern @entity9 university to shoot people , authorities in @entity2 said			1
no gunfire and no injuries were reported			1
most of @entity4 's schools already were out for @entity15 , but some students and staff remained , and the school sent e-mails and texts asking them to stay in locked rooms or offices			2
at least one person subsequently reported seeing somebody with a weapon on or near campus , though police were trying to determine whether the sighting was of an investigating police officer , @entity2 police chief @entity23 said monday afternoon			1
" nobody has been hurt			0
nobody has been apprehended with a gun			0
but in this day in age , when there is a call , it behooves us to overreact and not underreact , " said @entity23			1
" though it is starting to tilt in the direction of an innocent mistake , it started with a purposeful and malicious call , " the police chief told reporters			1
" and the @entity2 police are going to track down the person who made that call			2
we 're going to find the person who made that call , and we 're going to put handcuffs on the person who made that call , " he said			0
the shelter - in - place order slowed officers ' room - to - room searches of dorms and other buildings , because the people inside often were n't immediately opening doors for the police , not trusting that the police had come to check , according to @entity2 police officer @entity56			1
many of the doors , he said , did n't have did n't have peepholes , so officers were taking their time persuading the occupants			0
