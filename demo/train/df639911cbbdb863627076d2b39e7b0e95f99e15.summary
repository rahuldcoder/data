-- the @entity1 is putting federal money behind the development of small - scale nuclear reactors that supporters say are cheaper , safer and easier to build , though the design still needs federal approval			1
the first award under a $ 452 million program to boost the development of small modular reactors will go to a consortium led by @entity13 and the @entity14 , the @entity15 utility that already operates three commercial nuclear plants			1
the reactors will be about a third the size of those now used in nuclear power plants , with the @entity13 design generating about 180 megawatts of electricity -- enough to power almost 200,000 homes			1
however , industry skeptics say the economics and the safety of the concept remain untested			0
the total amount of the award has yet to be calculated , but the government will pay up to half the project cost and will work with the companies to get the new reactors licensed and operating within 10 years , the @entity1 said			1
" restarting the nation 's nuclear industry and advancing small modular reactor technologies will help create new jobs and export opportunities for @entity44 workers and businesses , and ensure we continue to take an all - of - the - above approach to @entity44 energy production , " energy secretary @entity35 said in a statement announcing tuesday 's decision			1
unlike current designs , the units -- shorthanded as @entity50 -- are designed to be installed underground instead of being located inside towering concrete buildings			1
they could run longer on the same nuclear fuel , and additional reactors could be added in a " plug and play " fashion , said @entity58 of the @entity59 , the industry 's trade association			2
" you do n't have to build a 1,000 - or 1,500 - megawatt power plant and hope that demand catches up , " said @entity58 , the @entity59 's senior director of policy development			0
" you can build chunks of power to more closely meet your demand curve			0
" nuclear plants provide about 20 % of the @entity44 electric power supply , but most of the 104 operating reactors date back to the 1960s and ' 70s			1
the @entity75 administration has supported the construction of the first new reactors since the 1979 partial meltdown at @entity81 's @entity80 plant , providing $ 8 billion in federal support for two nuclear power plants in @entity84			1
the industry and the @entity1 say that would make @entity88 a good choice for small utilities			1
but the designs are still under review by the @entity92 , whose approval is the worldwide " gold seal , " @entity58 said			2
the @entity92 launched a widespread review of @entity44 nuclear safety after the meltdowns at @entity101 's @entity100 nuclear power plant in 2011 caused by that nation 's devastating tsunami			2
@entity104 said safety and security recommendations issued after that disaster -- and after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks on @entity109 and @entity110 -- are being included " from the ground up			0
" @entity101 's nuclear fight intensifies placing the reactors underground would make them less vulnerable to the shaking from earthquakes , and the surrounding earth would absorb much of the heat released if an accident occurred , @entity104 said			2
the new designs are " orders of magnitude safer " than existing plants , " and we believe those plants are safe , " he said			2
but @entity125 , a nuclear expert at the @entity127 , said the advantages touted by the industry -- smaller facilities and fewer workers -- could be " invitations to disaster			0
" " what @entity100 has shown us is that existing nuclear power plants do n't have the personnel or resources to cope with severe emergencies , " said @entity125 , a physicist and senior scientist with the watchdog group			0
in addition , the modular design could make it more difficult to inspect and maintain key components , many of which would be located within the pressure vessel at the heart of the reactor , he said			1
@entity125 also questioned claims that about the cost advantages of the smaller reactors , noting that the boom in natural gas is squeezing even established nuclear utilities			0
" the @entity88 are without a doubt going to be more expensive than even large reactors , " he said			0
" their economics are only getting worse			0
" @entity104 acknowledged that some design issues " cut both ways , " and that the first companies to adopt the new technology will incur higher costs			0
but he said the experience of other industries , such as aerospace or the @entity44 nuclear submarine program , shows costs can drop significantly over the life of a program			2
" it 's important to understand that these designs are in the early stage -- at best 20 % to 30 % complete , " he said .			0
