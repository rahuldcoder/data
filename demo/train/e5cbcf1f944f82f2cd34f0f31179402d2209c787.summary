-- after being stricken with cancer , @entity1 dedicated his life to helping children in his native @entity5			1
in 2007 , he started a nonprofit youth soccer program called @entity7 , which stands for @entity9 du @entity8 ( foundation of @entity10 )			1
the program provides free equipment , coaching and food to hundreds of children from @entity5 's poorest slums			1
its aim is to teach the children to become responsible citizens			1
@entity0 asked @entity1 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity21 of 2011			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity21 ? @entity1 : i was getting home -- coming from a visit to an orphanage in @entity29 -- when i received the call			1
wow ! i was moved , very touched			0
i admit that i had difficulty believing it at the time			0
i am so happy for the foundation , so happy for the kids			0
i consider this as a blessing			0
i must also confess that i stress just a little thinking about all the things this implies : the media , the interviews , the photos			0
i am not used to all this press or all this attention around me , but if it is to help the children even better , i shall become used to it			2
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to @entity7 ? @entity1 : this recognition means a lot to us , here in @entity5 and internationally			1
it helps to bring awareness about the conditions our underprivileged kids live in			0
i think more people realize there is a lot to do , but a lot can be done by any of us			0
i thank @entity65 who , probably through me , wanted to touch these children , to give them new opportunities and offer them a better future			2
this is taking ( us to ) a scale about which i did not even dare to dream			0
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity21 ? @entity1 : we used to dream about a lot of improvements , more help we could bring to the kids or about helping even more kids ; there are so many of them who need it			1
some of our goals are to buy a field we would be able to use anytime we want ; to have an academy where we can help even better the kids who are talented in soccer and would love to become professional players ; to expand our program and have more girls ; to have a school with art , painting , music , so when the kids finish the program they have something in their hand ; and to have a real and solid structure with an adequate administration who will make sure that @entity7 ' work continues even if i am not here anymore			2
for sure , this money will help us to start making these dreams -- or some of them -- come true			2
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity1 : it is important to us that people understand that a lot of what they see , a lot of the results they can see on tv , are made mostly out of love			1
some months , i do n't even know how i will pay some of my coaches , because the financial donations i received this particular month were not enough			0
but still they will come , and still we will continue to support the kids , to listen to them and to play with them			0
this is @entity7 , and this is what all organizations working with these underprivileged kids should be about : love			0
love first , then comes the money			2
