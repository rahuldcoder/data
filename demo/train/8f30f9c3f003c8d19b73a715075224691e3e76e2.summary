-- yep , folks , we finally met the mother : monday night 's " @entity7 " revealed actress @entity4 as the show 's titular — and , until now , extremely elusive — character			1
the unveiling took place in the final few seconds of the season 8 finale , as @entity4 's yet - unnamed character simply walked up to a @entity13 ticket booth to purchase one ticket to the fictional @entity15 , presumably to go play in the band at the impending nuptials between @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and @entity20 ( @entity21 )			1
the show did n't exactly spell out the reveal ( casual fans could have missed it ) , but there was one key to knowing the doe - eyed girl was the mother : the bright yellow umbrella she was holding			1
that 's the linchpin accessory the show 's narrator and father @entity32 ( @entity33 ) previously set up as the woman 's signature — and identifying — item			1
@entity0 was on set for the filming of the game - changing scene , and scored an exclusive interview with co-creators @entity41 and @entity43			2
the pair revealed , among many other things , that we likely would have met the mother in may 2013 no matter what : the original plan was for the show to end after just eight seasons ( meaning it would have been over ... now ) , with the mother briefly introduced in the series finale			1
only after @entity7 was extended to nine seasons did bays and @entity43 make the decision to reveal the mother before the final season — in tonight 's episode			1
( though it seems @entity32 wo n't be coming face - to - face with her until much later next season			2
) @entity0 : ' @entity7 ' recap one ticket to @entity15 while the scene answered the biggest burning question — who was the woman at the center of the saga that @entity32 has been reliving for his kids ( and viewers ) since the show first launched in 2005 ? — it left us with many , many more : why do this now ? why did n't they cast a big , big star ? why was n't the mother actually @entity20 ? how was the long - awaited casting kept secret from the show 's incredibly rabid followers ? read on as @entity41 and @entity43 break down the mother of all reveals			1
@entity0 : it 's already been announced that next season will be your last			2
with another year to go , why introduce the mother now ? @entity41 : one of our hard and fast rules [ when we thought we were doing eight seasons ] was that we did n't want to meet her until the very end			1
we felt like , now that we 're doing another year , let 's find an interesting new twist			2
@entity43 : we 've talked here and there about letting the audience see the mother before @entity32			1
would that be fascinating or let some air out of the balloon ? we were scared of it for a long time , but this past season , it came up , and it just fit in so well			2
ultimately we view it like we 've been honing in on this mother mystery for so long			1
in season one , it was like a shot of planet earth from outer space			2
and we 've honed in and honed in and honed in , and we look at season nine as like now we 're down to @entity113 street view			2
we 've gone from a super-wide shot to super-microscopic - tight , and it just felt right to see the mother 's face and to give the audience that gift and that knowledge			1
there was something exciting about getting a little bit of her before @entity32 ever does			2
there was something that we felt like this audience who has stuck with us for all of these years we wanted to reward them with that			2
@entity0 : ' @entity7 ' casting poll bays : and to give ourselves the gift of having something			1
we did n't want to do season 9 unless we had something that just got us really excited to write it			2
this concept got us very excited to write it and lent itself to a lot of great ideas that came out			2
the tipping point was when you have enough ideas that you 're going to be bummed if you do n't get to try these ideas , that 's when it became worth it for us to do season 9 , and part of that is revealing the mother			1
the idea of getting to know her , getting to know where she 's coming from , it became too tantalizing to pass up			2
we always liked the poetic ending of you never really get to know her , you just see her face or something			2
@entity0 : truly , this is pay - off for the fans			0
@entity43 : the thing we 're proud about in this series , we were able to pack some real surprises into the conventional sitcom form			1
a lot of viewers have given up on meeting the mother prior to the final episode			1
there are a lot of people who think that 's true			0
i think this will count as a genuine surprise for a lot of people			0
a lot of people think , " oh , they got another year ; we 're never going to see her face this year			0
" i think the way that the season ends , i 'm hoping it will blow some people 's minds and surprise them and make them want to tune in and see what the hell we 're going to do with that			0
@entity0 : there was n't a peep out there about this happening			0
was the surprise element crucial to how you wanted this to roll out on screen ? bays : it 's an intended thing			0
and partly , it 's a fun way to do it			0
it will be fun to see people 's reactions			0
there 's something about as far as how as our experience as the audience is reflected in @entity32 's experience as a single guy , i like the idea of you never know when it 's going to happen , and when it does happen , it just happens and there she is			0
i think it 's a way to put the audience in @entity32 's shoes a little bit even though he does n't actually meet her in this episode			0
@entity0 : how did you keep the whole thing a secret ? @entity43 : in the script we called the character " definitely not the mother , " so it was very good code			1
we got very @entity227 and intense about it : we really did n't put it on paper ; we never emailed the outline or the script			0
we literally just kept it on hard copies of paper that we messengered back and forth to people and then got the copies back and destroyed [ them ]			0
bays : we had like a whole fake title			0
the script that we auditioned her from was titled " @entity242			0
" @entity43 : something no one in @entity244 would ever actually read			0
bays : all the extras from the scene with the mother are staff from @entity7			1
@entity0 : ' @entity7 ' renewed for final season @entity0 : how did it feel to finally have @entity4 on set and see it all play out ? @entity43 : she just had to walk and say one line , but we were all freaking out and losing our minds			1
all she said was , " one ticket to @entity261 , please			0
" it was a very surreal moment			0
it was a moment we pictured for a lot of years , and ultimately it was great			0
@entity0 : it seems like people thought the mother would be a big star			1
did you ever consider going that route ? @entity43 : we did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be , where it 's like , " oh , it 's @entity281 and i think blank of @entity281 ...			1
" you 're waiting years to meet this woman , and it 's like , " oh , he 's in love with @entity286 just like the rest of @entity288 is			0
" the whole idea is that @entity32 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience			0
" @entity4 is she 's a fantastic actress and she 's been in [ @entity292 musica ] once , and it 's a @entity294 - nominated , wonderful musical but she has n't done a ton of big tv parts or bigger film parts			1
it seems so much more interesting and so much more ted to find someone special and unique and new , someone that we have n't seen before and the whole idea is that @entity32 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience			0
bays : i do n't think it ever occurred to us			0
honestly , exhibit a for us in the discussions was @entity21			0
in the pilot of our show , @entity32 sees [ @entity21 ' ] @entity20 for the first time and — without naming names — the part of @entity20 was offered to a pretty famous actress and she turned it down and then we ended up going with @entity21 , who was our first choice from the beginning			1
thank @entity317 we did for a million reasons but among those is the fact that when @entity32 's seeing her for the first time , @entity288 's seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive			1
@entity0 : was there ever a moment when you thought about trying to make @entity20 the mother ? bays : no. we 've heard that question a lot			1
what always made the show interesting to us is that @entity32 meets the perfect woman , and it 's [ still ] not his final love story			1
