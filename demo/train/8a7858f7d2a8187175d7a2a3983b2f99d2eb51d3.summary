@entity0 -- there is an increasing threat of homegrown terror stemming from segments of a deeply isolated and alienated @entity10 - @entity9 community , a @entity3 committee hearing concluded wednesday			1
sen. @entity11 says a number of @entity10 - @entity9 support terrorist groups			1
the hearing , conducted by the @entity16 and @entity15 , focused on the attempted recruitment of young @entity10 - @entity9 men by @entity19 , " a violent and brutal extremist ( @entity10 ) group " with significant ties to @entity23 , according to the @entity24			1
" over the last two years , individuals from the @entity10 community in the @entity9 , including @entity9 citizens , have left for @entity10 to support and in some cases fight on behalf of @entity19 , " noted the committee 's chairman , sen. @entity11 , i - @entity27			2
@entity19 -- also known as the @entity33 -- was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the @entity9 government in march 2008			0
the hearing highlighted the case of @entity38 , a 27 - year - old @entity39 who had been radicalized by @entity19 in his adopted home state of @entity42 before traveling to @entity10 and blowing up himself and 29 others in october			2
the idea that @entity38 was radicalized in the @entity9 raised red flags throughout the @entity9 intelligence community			0
the incident -- the first suicide bombing by a naturalized @entity9 citizen -- was the " most significant case of homegrown @entity9 terrorism recruiting based on violent @entity53 ideology , " @entity11 said			1
" the dangers brought to light by these revelations is clear : radicalized individuals trained in terrorist tactics and in possession of @entity9 passports can clearly pose a threat to the security of our country , " said sen. @entity54 , @entity55			0
segments of the @entity10 - @entity9 community have been made vulnerable to recruitment by @entity19 because of a particularly tumultuous adjustment to @entity9 life , noted @entity72 , deputy director for intelligence at the @entity74			1
" despite significant efforts to facilitate their settlement into @entity9 communities , many @entity10 immigrants face isolation , " @entity72 said			0
" the ( tough ) adjustment to @entity9 society has reinforced their greater insularity compared to other more integrated recent immigrant communities and has aggravated the challenges of assimilation for their children , " he said			0
@entity10 began arriving in the @entity9 in significant numbers following the @entity9 intervention in @entity10 's humanitarian crisis in 1992 , @entity72 said			0
the @entity10 - @entity9 population is now concentrated in clusters primarily in @entity93 , @entity42 ; @entity94 , @entity95 ; @entity96 , @entity0 ; and @entity97 , @entity98			1
the potential recruitment of young @entity10 - @entity9 men has been made possible by " a number of factors that come together when a dynamic , influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men , " @entity72 said			1
many refugees , he said , " lack structure and definition in their lives " and are " torn between their parents ' traditional tribal and clan identities and the new cultures and traditions offered by @entity9 society			0
" @entity72 pointed out that there was no evidence of a radicalization of the entire @entity10 - @entity9 community , now believed to number between 70,000 and 200,000 people			1
in fact , he said , the @entity10 - @entity9 community has been victimized by a " small group of extremists who are essentially terrorizing their own community , who are recruiting and radicalizing young people within that community			1
" " we do n't have radicalized communities			0
we have radicalized clusters of ( young ) people , " emphasized @entity134 , a director of the @entity136 's national security branch			0
the potential terrorist indoctrination and recruitment was a consequence of these clusters , @entity72 said , and is the product of " the refugee experience of fleeing a war - torn country combined with isolation , perceived discrimination , marginalization and frustrated expectations			2
" local criminal familial and clan dynamics make some members of this community more susceptible to ( this ) sort of extremist influence " of groups such as @entity19 , he said			0
@entity72 said there is a serious concern about individuals being indoctrinated by @entity23 and @entity19 while in @entity10 and then returning to the @entity9 " with the intention to conduct attacks			2
