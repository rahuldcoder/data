@entity0 -- in the years leading up to 2011 , several celebrities , royals and politicians had claimed to have had their phones hacked by @entity6			1
the paper 's royal editor and a private investigator had even been convicted of intercepting phone messages and spent time in prison			0
the story was covered on the inside pages of selected newspapers but failed to really capture the @entity17 public 's attention			0
that all changed in july of that year when the @entity19 reported that police suspected the cellphone of murdered teenager @entity22 had been hacked by @entity6 and that messages had been deleted to free up space for new voicemail			1
the allegations sparked outrage : amid condemnation from politicians on all sides of the spectrum , the paper 's boss @entity27 closed down the 168 - year - old tabloid newspaper and paid @entity37 's parents and charities more than $ 4 million in compensation			1
at a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations , @entity27 declared : " this is the most humble day of my life			0
" timeline of phone - hacking scandal when @entity48 's parents appeared at the @entity49 set up by the government to investigate press ethics , they gave a raw assessment of the false hope that the deletion of messages had raised in the days after their daughter 's disappearance in march 2002			1
" i rang her phone , " recalled @entity37			2
" it clicked through on to her voicemail , so i heard her voice and it was just like , ' she 's picked up her voicemail , she 's alive			2
' " tragically , those hopes were dashed and six months later @entity48 's body was found in woodland in @entity68 in southern @entity69			1
although it was suspected that the deletion of the messages hampered the police investigation , the truth may have been more prosaic : later that year a lawyer acting for the country 's biggest force , the @entity73 , said there was no evidence @entity6 had been responsible for deleting the messages			1
the @entity19 issued a clarification , but the damage had been done to @entity6 and @entity27 's reputation			1
whatever took place , the fact remains that it took police nine years to bring nightclub bouncer @entity88 to justice			2
in june 2011 he was found guilty of murdering @entity22 and sentenced to life imprisonment			1
during the trial the jury was told @entity88 had previously murdered two other women and attempted to kill a fourth			2
so who was the girl whose murder in a quiet suburb of southwest @entity0 led to the closure of the @entity17 's top - selling paper , suspicions of collusion between police officers and journalists , and at one time even threatened to topple @entity27 from the media group he had led for half a century ? the scandal also led to charges being brought against several @entity27 employees , including two of prime minister @entity111 's friends			1
press dishes it out , but can it take it ? despite her extraordinary legacy , by most accounts @entity22 , who was known as @entity48 , was a normal , bright 13 - year - old schoolgirl who had a good relationship with her parents and elder sister @entity122			1
her friends testified during @entity88 's trial in @entity0 that she had a sunny personality and was her normal self on the day of her disappearance			1
" she was one of the funniest people i had ever met , " @entity128 said in a statement			0
" she would always be trying to make people laugh , joking and smiling			0
" she was one of those sort of people that when she was happy she was exceptionally happy , an infectious personality			0
if she was sad about something she would be particularly sad and get upset			0
she valued her friendships and family a lot			0
" @entity128 , who was one of the last people to see @entity48 alive , said she ate chips with her friend in a @entity143 © in @entity144 after school			2
" we parted and i gave her a hug and asked if she would be alright walking home on her own and she said , ' yeah , i 'll be absolutely fine			0
' " i then turned around and shouted back at her ' i would not tell anyone what we had been talking about			0
' " @entity128 added that they had been discussing a boy whom @entity48 fancied			2
after the friends parted , @entity48 started to walk to her home nearby , but was snatched by @entity88 as she walked along a road			1
@entity48 's sister also told the court she knew instinctively something was wrong when she returned home to find the house empty			1
she said : " i knew @entity48 would n't go out without telling @entity162 or @entity163			2
i rang @entity48 's mobile			2
it was switched off so i left a message on her answer phone telling her to come home because @entity163 was really annoyed			0
" i was worried because @entity48 would always ring to tell us she was going to be late			0
it was so unusual for her not to be home on time			0
i knew instinctively something bad had happened to @entity48 and that she had been abducted			0
" @entity48 's disappearance sparked a nationwide search involving more than 100 police officers and a reconstruction of her last movements on the tv program " @entity185			1
" detectives from @entity188 police however suggested she had not been taken by force and had run away			0
some friends indeed portrayed a different side to @entity48 , suggesting she had been " distressed " at the time of disappearance , after finding bondage pornography belonging to her father @entity193			1
police initially considered him a suspect , but later apologized			0
in a statement read to the court , @entity198 said : " @entity48 told me some pornographic magazines had been found in her @entity163 's drawer			1
" at the time @entity48 was a bit upset about it , not much for herself but her mum			0
i know that @entity48 did see them and there was more than one of them			0
" during the trial @entity88 's lawyers used this testimony , along with a " goodbye " note that @entity48 had written to her parents and a poem in which she said " i hate myself , " to paint a picture of the teenager as unhappy and distressed			1
his tactics caused great distress to the family , but the jury failed to believe his plea of innocence			0
@entity225 , the author of a book on @entity227 , " @entity228 , " told @entity1 that in the wake of the 2011 trial , during which the @entity232 were pilloried by the tabloids over the pornography revelations , the family grew to loathe the press			2
it was in this atmosphere that the revelation was made about the hacking of @entity48 's phone , which became , according to @entity225 , " the defining moment from which @entity6 could not recover			1
" " i do n't think it 's as simple as the fact that @entity22 's phone was hacked and that led to the end of the @entity6			1
i think there are more layers to the story than that , and we may never know what actually happened			0

police said in 2011 that @entity22 's voicemail hacked by @entity6
@entity37 was 13 - year - old murdered by @entity88 in southwest @entity0
@entity48 described in court as funny and bright girl with normal family life
but she was troubled to have discovered her father 's pornography recently
