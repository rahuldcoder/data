@entity1 , @entity0 -- handsome , articulate and lightning fast -- @entity5 's @entity4 can now add two more words to his list of qualities : very rich			1
@entity4 will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future			2
the @entity13 is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to @entity17 -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in @entity20 , experts say			1
on sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion , easily winning the @entity24 @entity23 in @entity25			0
the 23 - year - old signed a five - year contract with @entity5 worth an estimated $ 140m in january			0
it leaves him lagging along way behind @entity31 's @entity30 , who is paid an estimated $ 50m a year for driving , but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall			1
@entity35 , chief executive of the @entity36 and @entity37 and @entity39 ' chairman , said @entity4 was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air			2
he had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season			0
" he is young , mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers , film stars -- and a lot more articulate than @entity30 , " @entity35 said			2
" he is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing , much like @entity17 in golf			0
he is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best , much like @entity54			2
" @entity55 , @entity56 's managing director , said @entity4 was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term			1
his performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of " young turks " -- @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 -- who had great potential			0
@entity55 said in terms of the media @entity4 's performance , friendliness , @entity0 speaking background and professionalism were key assets			1
if he could maintain these he would earn more than @entity54 -- the sport 's first billionaire driver			1
indeed , @entity54 set an example which @entity4 would be wise to follow			1
he was the first driver to win personal sponsors after @entity31 allowed him to sign a $ 10m annual deal with a @entity80 bank to place its logo on his cap			2
the @entity80 also actively pursued the development of his own retail range , which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $ 30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner			0
@entity55 said @entity54 's manager , @entity88 , was very good			1
" @entity54 was a nice guy but not very charming			2
however , he was very professional and you knew he would turn up , " @entity55 said			0
@entity35 agreed @entity4 would earn considerably more than @entity54 , and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers			1
however , there were pitfalls			0
@entity4 had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to @entity98 to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax , @entity35 said			2
" he said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month			0
" @entity35 said appearing arrogant , being caught out by the tabloid press , endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value			0
" the big danger with someone like @entity4 is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion			1
there is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value			0
" @entity55 said @entity4 needed to develop his " life - time brand "			1
while @entity30 may not be a media darling he had developed an " @entity30 " image , which was just as important in the long term			2
@entity0 footballer @entity120 , whose performance had dropped off , had successfully developed a life - time brand that would out last his playing career			1
@entity55 said @entity4 's one weakness may be his father , @entity125			1
" his dad is his manager			0
your brand positioning is as an individual ... having your dad around too much could affect your brand			0
" @entity55 said @entity4 would have to be wary of bad press , but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel			1
" i think that is part of the glamour ... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

experts say @entity4 is set to earn more than @entity54
@entity120 's " life - time brand " provides valuable lessons
a little bit of *scandal* is good for the bank balance
@entity30 's " @entity30 " persona allows sponsors to find perfect match
