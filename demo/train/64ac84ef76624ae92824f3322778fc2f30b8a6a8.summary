-- friday 's verdict came swiftly , the evidence robust , the policing stellar			0
but the legacy of the young woman who was killed ca n't just be five convictions and laws improved on paper -- it must be to end the violent culture of sexual entitlement that led to her death			1
the death penalty will not stop assaults on women			2
only two things can bring that change : certain justice , brought by nuts and bolts improvements to the criminal justice system , and mass public education			1
a @entity25 study this week uncovered this difficult truth -- one in four men surveyed in the @entity28 admitted to raping a woman			2
almost three - quarters of these men did it because they believed the woman did n't have the right to say no. unless this attitude of sexual entitlement is dissolved , the violence will go on , the police will continue to register a fraction of sexual assault complaints ( encouraged by police commissioners who blamed increased rape on " promiscuity " ) , marital rape will continue to be legal , doctors will see no reason to stop using the " two finger test " ( to show a woman is used to having sex -- a practice linked to lower convictions , easy sentences )			1
so , the good news is there is a way to do it , and we know it can work			0
public education has proven to be effective when it is evidence - based , well - targeted and resourced			1
success stories show that education campaigns can limit the misogyny and patriarchy that fuel attacks			1
huge education and awareness drives have slashed hiv infection rates in this country and across the world			2
here in @entity70 , the " @entity69 " campaign reached more than 240 million people in five years -- its spread made possible by funding and support from the central government			1
evaluations of the campaign found a three-fold jump in awareness of the law against domestic violence , the willingness to discuss domestic violence jumped by 70 % , and the campaign helped stop domestic violence in many homes			1
and @entity70 has shown it can conquer seemingly insurmountable problems -- take polio , for example			1
in 2009 , this country still accounted for over half the world 's polio cases , but after two years of intensified public education to overcome fear and perform widespread vaccinations , only one single case was reported in 2011			1
only the central government has the reach and resources to lead such a campaign			2
it needs to commit serious money to end this epidemic of violence			0
that means an investment of at least 50 rupees a year for every @entity70 citizen in a mass public education campaign -- to reach every corner of our country			1
although this seems a lot , it 's small when you consider the rewards , and much of this cost could be covered via partnerships with private media			0
second , the government must show that this campaign is here to stay : a full - scale media and outreach barrage should last at least four years , while education programs in schools and other grassroots education efforts should be permanently instituted			2
@entity70 's done it before , we are a country free from the scourge of polio and @entity130 was beaten back not only through drugs , but largely through mass awareness			1
then , it was supported by the @entity134 -- now it should be done for women 's equality			0
third , the prime minister must establish a responsible body with the best brains and the power to oversee this project -- drawing from the advertising industry , the most powerful ambassadors from our film industries and cricket , and the most committed campaigners in government , the women 's movement and other non-profits			0
to state the obvious , there is no dearth of talent in @entity70 to do this brilliantly , and such a high profile will make the campaign popular and visible , as well as accountable			2
and finally , the government must establish goals and targets for the reduction of sexual harassment and assault , so that progress is carefully monitored and policies are adapted and improved based on results			0
only the government has the power to lead something this ambitious , because of the funding and scale such a project requires			0
in the past few months , thousands have been on the streets across the country and more than a million people have backed @entity174 's call for the @entity70 government to launch this public education campaign			1
just this week , thousands have written directly to minister of communications shri @entity178 calling for fast action			0
there is a huge mandate for action			0
the good news is that @entity183 has already promised publicly -- in response to a question i put to him on a tv panel -- that he would back a public education campaign to help realize women 's freedoms			1
it is time for him to put forward a timetable and a fully costed plan			0
the trial that ended friday brought some justice			0
but more than 24,000 women and children raped last year are struggling through a slow , often misogynist criminal justice system			0
real justice will only be served though , when millions of women like that young therapist are able to work , play , loiter or go out for a walk alone in the middle of the night if they like , their freedoms intact			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

the sentencing of the @entity215 gang rapists wo n't stop sexual violence , writes @entity211
she says challenging attitudes of sexual entitlement among men will be key
she is calling for a massive public education campaign to address the problem
@entity227 public campaigns have had success in @entity70 *tackling* polio and @entity130
