join @entity0 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity2 at 11:10 a.m. wednesday			1
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you			0
@entity0 says that whether candidates wear a flag lapel pin should n't be a political issue			1
( @entity2 ) -- when is the last time you watched a mindless movie that had no redeeming value for you intellectually , but all it did was make you laugh ? that perfectly describes the raging debate among voters and the rabid television and radio talk show hosts who love to yell and scream from the top of their lungs , " i 'm an @entity22 , and by golly , you better show as much appreciation for this country as i do ! " but once you finish listening to these high - minded bloviators -- and yes , that includes the voters who have bought into this nonsensical issue -- ask yourself : does it really have anything to do with anything ? i 've watched this debate reach the levels of absurdity this year because journalists and commentators have raised the question to sen. @entity41 , " why do n't you wear a flag lapel pin ? " i really got a kick out of that one during the @entity45 debate last month because not one person on stage -- sens. @entity48 and @entity41 , along with moderators @entity50 and @entity52 -- bothered to accessorize their attire with a flag lapel pin			1
sen. @entity55 has been traveling the globe as the presumptive @entity58 presidential nominee , and this former @entity60 pilot often does n't wear a flag lapel pin			1
it has become sort of like bird watching as i 've surveyed elected officials on the local and national levels and looked them over like a hen - pecked mother or a foaming - at - the - mouth military drill sergeant , studying their attire and deeming them insufficiently @entity22 because of their lack of decency and respect by refusing to adorn themselves appropriately with a lapel pin			1
so , after listening to radio callers and the folks that e-mail various tv shows , maybe we ought to expand this need to express our @entity81 even further			0
should n't we insist that our politicians all begin to sport red , white and blue socks in order to feel good knowing that they are walking as @entity22 ? how about asking officeholders to sport the @entity22 colors as undergarments to show that their undying love for the country is so important , they want the flag pressed against their skin ? there have been times when the candidates -- especially @entity55 , who has beaten back skin cancer -- have worn hats on the campaign trail			1
i want to know , datgummit , why the people running for the highest office in the land did n't cover their head with an @entity22 flag baseball cap to express to the nation their love and affection for the @entity22 of @entity106 since it is clear that our nation is paralyzed and so not able to close our borders , feed the homeless , develop businesses in the inner cities and save people from having their homes taken by foreclosure due to ruthless mortgage companies , all because some folks do n't wear a flag lapel pin , we need to lead a national movement to demand that @entity120 and the states make requiring officeholders to wear a flag lapel pin the 28th amendment to the @entity22 @entity125			1
see , if it is so important , then take it all the way			2
do n't make it optional			2
do n't leave it up to someone to choose to wear a flag lapel pin			1
let 's really show those politicians that nothing is more important to us than seeing them with the @entity22 flag on our chest			1
that 's what zealots do			0
they take something so simple , so personal , so voluntary , and absolutely lose their mind , trying to force someone else to do as them , and everyone else be damned			0
folks , the first year i ever cast a ballot for political office was in 1988			0
and in the last 20 years , whether it was mayoral , school board , city council , or a statewide , congressional or presidential campaign , the thought of what was on a politician 's lapel never entered into the equation as to whether they are worthy of office			2
those who will criticize me will say , " well , @entity0 , if it 's no big deal , then why not wear one ? " and the reply is the same : " if it 's no big deal , then why do you make it a big deal ? " let me tell you something : when i 'm on the golf course and i slip my wedding ring into my golf bag , the rev. @entity171 is still my wife			2
when we shoot hoops and i remove my @entity178 ring from my right hand , i still love my school			0
the fact that i can no longer wear my 1987 class ring from @entity184 's @entity183 does n't mean i do n't cherish the crimson and gold			0
and i may not be able to fit into the shirt i pledged in , but i will be a member of @entity188 until the day i die			0
i am an unapologetic @entity189 , but you wo n't see a cross dangling from my neck or a @entity194 charm bracelet on my wrist			0
why ? because my love of @entity197 is in my heart			0
this debate is useless , tiresome and distracting			1
why ? because if there are members of @entity120 who wear a flag lapel pin but refuse to shore up our borders , do n't do enough to stop the flow of drugs into our neighborhoods , or do n't help to eradicate the gaps between the haves and have nots , then are they truly fighting for the concerns of @entity22 , or playing on the emotions of people by what 's on their lapel ? we 're better than that			1
we 're smarter than that			0
it 's time that we make decisions based on substance , which is what we say we actually care about			1
but maybe we 're just lying to ourselves about that , too			0

@entity0 says flag lapel pin debate is useless , tiresome and distracting
he asks : if those pins are so important , why should n't *underwear* , hats be , too ?
decisions about candidates should be based on substance , he says
he says topics such as secure borders , drug fight , *economy* are real issues
