-- a fresh round of clues arrived this week from two @entity4 lawmakers who are regularly asked about their desire to pursue their party 's nomination in 2016			0
while each cited different reasons , both sen. @entity10 of @entity11 and sen. @entity12 of @entity13 say they 're now more interested in running			1
@entity10 says the current @entity15 gridlock is limiting his ability to advocate for the kind of policies he sees as critical for moving @entity19 forward and that the @entity20 might be a better place for that			1
" i 'll have to make a decision in 2016 either way , because i 'm up for re-election in the @entity15			1
and for me it 's not going to be about the position , it 's going to be about where can i best advocate for a 21st century reform agenda that allows us to usher in another @entity19 century , " @entity10 told @entity33 ' " @entity32			0
" " the decision i have to make is can i best do that as a senator , or can i best do that as running and hopefully winning a presidency , " he said			0
" and that 's a question i 'll have more clarity on after this mid-term , because i can promise you this : the one place where i will not be able to do that from is a @entity15 that is still run by [ majority leader ] @entity46 that allows no votes on anything of substance or importance			0
" @entity12 , however , says that in addition to midterm election outcomes , events outside of @entity52 are playing into his decision			1
in an interview with @entity57 , @entity12 again denounced president @entity59 's foreign policy and said he thinks voters want the @entity19 to play a more prominent role in world affairs			1
" the @entity19 people in 2014 and also november 2016 are going to be looking for leaders who want to work to restore @entity19 's leadership in the world , " @entity12 said			0
one factor @entity12 said is impacting his decision to seek higher office : the debate in the @entity4 on how deeply the @entity19 should be enmeshed in global crises			2
" it increases my interest in doing everything i can to change the direction we 're on , " @entity12 said			2
on some issues , @entity76 and @entity77 sound a lot alike @entity0 's @entity80 contributed to this report .			0
