-- seven - time world champion @entity1 has continued to pillory @entity3 's tires , complaining that they are like driving on " raw eggs			1
" the @entity7 driver blamed the quicker degradation of the @entity11 manufacturer 's products for the scenario which has seen four race winners in as many starts this season , and much closer competition between the drivers			1
" i just think that they 're playing a much too big effect because they are so peaky and so special that they do n't put our cars or ourselves to the limit , " he told @entity0 ahead of this weekend 's @entity18			2
" we drive like on raw eggs and i do n't want to stress the tires at all			2
otherwise you just overdo it and you go nowhere			0
" the 43 - year - old @entity30 has been a vocal critic of @entity3 , calling on the company to rethink its approach after several drivers struggled with tire degradation during last month 's @entity36			1
he was backed by @entity38 boss @entity37 , whose drivers also struggled with the tires			1
@entity41 suffered a puncture with three laps remaining , retiring on the penultimate lap , while @entity45 finished down in eighth and lost his championship lead to race winner @entity47			0
@entity3 replaced @entity48 as @entity50 's sole tire supplier in 2011 , winning a three - year contract			1
@entity48 had been the sole provider from 2007 - 2010 , after @entity52 pulled out			1
however , @entity3 has argued it should be congratulated for such an open , unpredictable season			1
the manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing , with director @entity57 saying : " we are pushing the limits			2
" it 's a very , very aggressive approach that we took			2
it 's what we were asked to do			2
we were asked to bring challenges to the teams and this is what we 've done			0
" @entity1 's teammate @entity66 , however , had a very different view on the tires			1
the 26 - year - old @entity30 , who won the @entity70 last month for his first victory in 111 attempts , took a positive spin on the unpredictability			0
" i find it a big challenge for us drivers and an interesting challenge			0
it 's different but very interesting , " he told @entity0			0
" this tire management , getting the most out of it , understanding when to push , when to take it easy			0
it 's so on a knife 's edge with the tires that it 's good and it 's great for racing			2
it 's great , it 's mixed everything up , lots of overtaking , lots of things happening , fantastic for everybody			1
" while @entity66 is sixth in the drivers ' rankings , @entity1 is languishing in 18th as he seeks his first podium placing since coming out of retirement in 2010			1
however , the former @entity104 star is proud to see younger compatriots such as @entity66 , @entity106 of @entity107 and @entity109 's @entity108 with him on the 24 - strong grid this season , and he reserved special praise for @entity114 's double world champion @entity47			1
" being good friends , particularly with @entity47 , sort of makes it even more special because he grew up on my go - kart track , " @entity1 said			1
" we know each other from childhood			0
his childhood mainly -- i was a little bit grown up by that stage			0
and seeing him do well makes me proud			0
" the @entity7 cars have been a lot more competitive this season , and @entity1 hopes they can transform their improved pace with more consistent race results			1
" we have got one win under our belt			0
got a bit unlucky in that race -- could have been a one - two without a doubt -- but it proves that we made a huge step because we have to consider where we come from , " he said			0
" last year was n't really what we were looking for			0
starting the @entity142 new generation we had media success and finally we managed a victory , and i 'm pretty sure we can have other good races this year being on the podium , and maybe even being on top of the podium			0
