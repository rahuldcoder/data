-- you probably know him best from season 11 of " @entity4			2
" but trainer @entity5 is more than just a temporary @entity7 replacement			1
the martial arts expert has a background in biomedical science and uses his knowledge of @entity13 and @entity14 fitness disciplines to train celebrities from @entity17 supermodels @entity18 and @entity19 to rap artist q - @entity20 when he 's not sweating with a-listers , @entity5 is traveling abroad to teach his favorite workout , capoeira			1
this mix of martial arts and dance was created by slaves in @entity29 and uses participants ' body weight to tone and strengthen			1
" it 's different -- that 's why i like it , " @entity5 says			1
" you know , it 's like i can out - swagger in capoeira			1
having swagger lifting ? uh , kind of			2
but i can really put my signature and personality and my stance on my capoeira			1
you 're going to know you 're doing it with @entity5			1
" @entity5 's also a judge on the online reality show " @entity49 , " where contestants compete to be the next big celebrity fitness trainer			1
he took a break on set to speak with @entity0 about the show , the art of motivation and our biggest nutrition downfall			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : why did you join " @entity61 " ? @entity5 : i think the fitness industry needs something like this			1
i think this is a great way to motivate ( new trainers ) and get them inspired and actually learn how to better themselves , not only as a personality but also as a business and a marketable commodity			2
truck driver dances off 97 pounds @entity0 : is there anything on the show that you 've really been shocked by or impressed by ? @entity5 : definitely shocked			1
i think there 's definitely been more newbies coming in that really have no clue about what they have to offer			1
what we 're judging is on five categories : the concept , marketability , user base , personality and star power			2
and a lot of people come in and do not have a concept			2
they do n't have any idea what the brand is , or they do n't have a name chosen out for it			2
that , to me , is pretty shocking			2
if you 're going to step up in the auditioning process for a show like this and want to get chosen as the next fitness star with a $ 150,000 grand prize , you 've got to really come in with a clear ( idea )			1
so it 's been a little frustrating			1
@entity0 : @entity107 is april 7 , and the theme this year is hypertension			2
what can people do to prevent high blood pressure ? @entity5 : foods that are high in sodium or salt are some of the things that you really have to control			1
anything that 's packaged , especially meats , are generally going to be higher in sodium			1
so you really should try to eat fresh foods			0
it may take a little more time to prepare the foods , but you 're guaranteed to have a lot less sodium			0
i generally , with my clients , try to stick under 1,000 ( milligrams ) a day			0
if you look at some ingredients , let 's say on a ramen noodle thing , it 's got 1,000 ( milligrams ) just in one serving			1
so you 've got to read food labels			0
something that a lot of people do n't realize too is ( that ) sugar can retain a lot of water in the body , and that can affect your blood pressure			0
worst fast - food meals for sodium @entity0 : what are some of the biggest traps for sodium ? @entity5 : if you really want to be low - sodium , you have to prepare your food			1
@entity152 is one of the flavors that makes food taste good -- salt , sugar and fat			0
so it 's a natural thing for all chefs and cooks to add salt , because it enhances the flavor of the food			1
if you go out to eat , i guarantee you 're going to be eating a lot of salted foods that you are going to have no idea			0
how are you going to read a food label on a plate of food that 's handed to you at a diner ? you ca n't			1
the new restaurant fat traps @entity0 : you were all about tough love on " @entity4			0
" is that still your style ? @entity5 : put it this way : i think when it comes to love , you 've got to give love and you got ta give tough love			1
so my philosophy is if somebody does a great job , you have to commend them , give them a fist bump , congratulate them			0
they gave you a good effort and it 's positive reinforcement			1
but if they 're slacking , i am definitely going to call them out on it			0
i 'm going to be their accountability , in their ear until they stop doing it			0
@entity0 : high - intensity interval training is all the rage			0
what is it about @entity209 sessions that really work ? @entity5 : when you do these types of intense workouts , they cause a big metabolic disturbance in your body			1
think of race car driving -- there 's the normal race car and then they have the little nitrous oxide switch that turns on the turbo			1
you do n't need ( the turbo ) when you 're taking , like , a @entity225 class			0
but now think about doing sprints on a hill			0
you can not do those for an hour like you can in a @entity225 class because the intensity is too high			0
you 're not doing aerobic training , you 're doing anaerobic training			0
in anaerobic training , the body tends to have to call on the nitrous oxide because the intensity is so hard it needs the extra boost			0
( that ) causes a big disturbance in the system			0
as a result , when you 're trying to get your metabolism back to normal , it does n't happen for free			0
it takes energy to do that , and it takes calories			0
and that 's what you want			1
you want to be burning calories after you work out			0
the problem becomes for most people -- it 's not pleasant , it 's painful			1
you have to have the pain tolerance to be able to deal with that , which a lot of people do not			0
@entity0 : what 's the biggest weight loss or fitness obstacle you see people encounter ? @entity5 : really , no. 1 is diet			1
most people want to think it 's a fitness thing or a nutrition regimen , and i 'm like , it 's a mental and emotional thing			1
we are in a society where we 're exposed to food so much of the time , and what people do n't realize is that food is a drug			0
chemicals make up drugs ; chemicals make up food			0
food is the most over-prescribed drug we have today			0
food is a lot of people 's therapy -- when we say comfort food , we really mean that			1
it 's releasing dopamine and serotonin in your brain that makes you feel good			2
and as you ( indulge ) more and more and more , it can become a little bit addictive			0
after you do that for too long , it can no longer be a choice -- you really change the physical structure of your brain and it 's going to be harder to quit			2
( but ) the food addiction is only part of it			0
the emotional issues are the deeper thing , and if you do n't fix that , it 's just not going to work			2
journaling helps woman lose half her body weight @entity0 : how do you get clients over mental barriers ? @entity5 : i think what i try to do with everyone is build self - confidence and accountability			1
you want people to be self - motivating , in a sense			0
if you can build accountability and confidence in people , the little switch will go on inside of them			0
they 're going to show up on time			2
their diet is going to change			0
but how you do that -- that is the art form			0
that 's the emotional intelligence you have to have			2
you have to ask the right questions			0
these are the intangibles you ca n't necessarily teach trainers or motivators			0
@entity328 champ : your mind matters more @entity0 : what 's your weakness ? you have to have at least one			2
@entity5 : peanut butter -- i ca n't even buy peanut butter anymore			1
i had to switch to powdered peanut butter because it 's less calories , but that 's definitely one of my big vices			2
@entity0 : any last piece of advice for our readers ? @entity5 : if i could give one tip for people -- it 's not an exercise or nutrition regimen			1
it 's to walk your talk and believe in yourself , because at the end of the day , the dumbbell and diet do n't get you in shape			2
it 's your accountability to your word .			2
