( @entity4 ) -- just about every zombie movie i can think of is set , for the most part , in tightly defined spaces where groups of survivors huddle to fend off the flesh - hungry hordes outside			2
" @entity15 , " which may be the most entertaining and accomplished zombie thriller since @entity17 's " @entity16 " ( 1979 ) , has touches of that suspenseful high - tension claustrophobia			1
yet it 's a very different sort of zombie feast ( far more than , say , " @entity20 " )			2
it 's vast and sprawling and spectacular ; it 's the first truly globalized orgy of the undead			0
box office preview : ' @entity27 ' eyes a monstrous debut ; ' @entity15 ' hopes to go viral the director , @entity28 , is a filmmaker whose work i 've never particularly liked ( he made the genteel " @entity33 , " the overblown " @entity34 , " and the @entity31 dud " @entity32 " )			1
here , though , working from the 2006 @entity36 novel " @entity15 : an @entity40 of the @entity41 , " he shows a new audacity and flair			1
" @entity15 " is epically scaled , but it 's not a messy , noisy , @entity46 - bogus , throw - everything - at - the - audience sort of blockbuster			1
it 's thrillingly controlled , and it builds in impact			0
the film opens with music that 's meant to remind you of @entity52 , the chilling theme music from " @entity53 , " and that 's followed by a collage of actual tv news snippets cleverly edited together to suggest a world already tilting toward the abyss			0
in @entity60 , where @entity15 ( @entity68 ) , his wife ( @entity63 ) and their two daughters ( @entity66 and @entity67 ) are driving from their suburban home toward the center of town , we 're plunged into the first disquieting evidence of the zombie virus , the warning signs of breakdown : giant traffic jams , a street - corner explosion , cops whizzing by , and , finally , a zombie — or is it just an angry , desperate civilian ? — crashing up against the windshield			1
@entity68 : from ' @entity83 ' to ' @entity15 ' when people in " @entity15 " get bitten and turn into rabid undead freaks , the conversion happens frighteningly quickly , without a lot of fuss			1
they lie on the ground for a moment , then get all twitchy , as if they 're receiving an electroshock treatment , and their eyes bulge up to the heavens in rage			0
@entity96 , a former @entity97 investigator , spends most of the film traveling around the world , searching for the origins of the virus ( and a possible cure ) , yet metaphorically speaking , we 're already cued to see what has brought about this onslaught			1
" @entity15 " is rooted in the current mood of economic panic and terrorist fear and impending chaos			1
it presents the zombie army as a culmination of what it 's going to look like if and when the bottom falls out of our society			2
an early scene set in @entity117 , where @entity96 looks over the dusty remains of @entity119 , has a hushed creepiness , but " @entity15 " finds its own unique atmosphere of large - scale disorder after @entity96 arrives in @entity123 , where the @entity124 have erected a wall around the city to keep the zombies out			1
the wall does n't work			0
as the zombies — and there are thousands of them — shimmy up the side of it , in a squirmy hill of bodies that spill over the top of the edifice , the action hits a raw nerve of peril , a feeling that nothing can keep them out			0
' bad teacher 2 ' in development with @entity145 " @entity15 " lifts some of its vérité - apocalypse mood , as well as the terrifying speed with which the zombies move , from @entity151 's " @entity150 " ( 2003 )			2
yet this is a much more varied and surprising movie , built around a soberly commanding performance by @entity68 as the family man who must leave his wife and daughters on a @entity97 command ship as he hops from one trouble spot to the next			1
as @entity96 , @entity68 is cool , fearless , tense , compassionate and brutally tough ( at one point , he chops off the hand of a soldier to save her from going zombie )			1
he 's feral grace under pressure			0
the stakes for survival keep getting raised			0
a zombie attack aboard an airplane has a nightmarish this - is - really happening intensity ( though it does give the film a semi-preposterous moment , when the plane starts to go down )			0
then @entity68 arrives at a @entity172 facility , where he must brave sterile white corridors dotted with zombies to get inside a lab vault			2
the film lets us linger for a bit on what the zombies look like — one 's a gnashing @entity182 clone , one clicks its teeth in close - up like a demented gopher — and the story 's blend of terror and ingenuity attains an intoxicating , jittery finesse			0
" @entity15 " turns the prospect of the end of our world into something tumultuous and horrifying and , at the same time , exciting			2
it 's scary good fun			1
