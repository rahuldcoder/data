-- there is a new level of intensity in the courting of the @entity6 vote , and it culminated last week in two @entity7 , one with gov. @entity8 and one with president @entity9			1
but before i get to that , there 's the issue of the secretly recorded videotape of @entity8 's remarks at a fundraiser earlier this year , where he was caught on camera saying it would have been helpful if he were @entity6			1
this election cycle , we have seen political operatives perfect the art of feigned outrage			0
after the video was released , @entity24 pounced on the remark , calling it offensive and insulting			2
the question regarding @entity8 possibly having @entity30 heritage has come up before			1
@entity8 's father was born in a colony of @entity34 mormons in @entity35 and soon after , the family moved back to the @entity34			1
in @entity8 's last interview with @entity7 , in january , the network 's co-anchor , @entity37 -- who is fiercely proud of his @entity30 descent -- told @entity8 that under the @entity41 , he could claim @entity30 citizenship			1
@entity37 asked @entity8 why he was n't embracing his @entity30 roots when he could be the first @entity6 president			1
@entity8 answered then with a similar answer to the one on the video			1
he gave a brief description of the circumstances of his father 's birth , but then explained that neither he nor his dad was @entity30 or had any claim to @entity6 heritage			1
he finished by quipping , " i do n't think people would think i was being honest with them if i said i was @entity54			0
but i would appreciate it if you 'd get that word out			0
" i saw nothing wrong with @entity8 's answer			1
when he tries to be , it often comes across as awkward			0
but his remark was not offensive			0
what would be insulting is if he used his father 's @entity30 birth to try to pass himself off as what he is not , solely for political purposes			1
and he is right : being @entity6 would probably help him improve his @entity6 support , which is around 26 % , according to the most recent @entity71 poll			1
it might give him a better understanding of our culture and idiosyncrasies			2
it would help to be able to say some words in @entity79 when campaigning in swing states like @entity81 , @entity35 and @entity82			0
even then , @entity8 would not win the @entity6 vote , but it could at least marginally improve his numbers			1
now , back to the @entity85 : the @entity86 did not choose minority moderators			0
so @entity7 organized its own forums with both candidates			1
they were n't debates , but pointed and relevant questions were asked			0
i was at both forums			0
at the forum with @entity8 , a rowdy and wildly supportive crowd clapped , whooped and hollered at practically every word he said			1
when the moderators asked questions the audience members did n't like , they booed			0
@entity8 got a lot of help from this audience			1
it gave him energy and unconditional support and reinforcement			0
the next day , the @entity9 crowd was starkly different			2
it was solemn and eerily quiet			0
that turned the conversation somber at times			0
@entity9 supporters accuse the @entity8 campaign of packing the room with supporters			1
that 's what campaigns are supposed to do			2
both were given the same number of tickets			0
the @entity8 campaign out - organized and outsmarted @entity122			1
@entity9 gave @entity7 an hour ; @entity8 gave it only 35 minutes			1
this was an unfortunate decision			0
for most of the interview , @entity8 surpassed expectations and made a good showing			1
he got a real grilling over his immigration positions			2
this would have happened no matter how short the interview			2
@entity8 said things during the primary that have come back to haunt him			1
his tone has now changed			0
he 's gone from talking about self - deportation to saying there will be no massive rounding up and deportations of undocumented people			2
now , instead of promising to veto the @entity140 , he invokes sen. @entity142 's plan			2
he is still not giving much detail on the thornier immigration questions			2
he talks about fixing legal immigration but does n't say how he is going to address the 11 million undocumented people already here			2
it 's a mystery to me what he plans to do with the young undocumented students currently covered by the @entity9 administration 's deferred action directive , which halts their deportation			1
his campaign tells me his answer could not be any clearer			2
i have a law degree and still can not decipher his words			0
apparently , neither can the experienced journalists who keep asking him the same question over and over again hoping for a real answer			2
in a @entity162 interview , he was asked four separate times if he planned to revoke or keep the @entity9 directive , which will last for an initial period of two years			1
during the @entity167 , co-anchor @entity166 tried unsuccessfully three times to get him to give a " yes " or " no " to the same question			2
all we got was an unpresidential display of a candidate dancing , prancing and pirouetting around an issue			0
it was the low moment in an otherwise successful interview for @entity8			1
next it was @entity9 's turn to get grilled about immigration			1
he was held accountable for promises he made four years ago			0
perhaps the most poignant moment came when @entity9 was asked what he considered his biggest failure			0
with sad resignation , @entity9 said it was not having passed immigration reform			0
@entity186 ended the point by telling @entity9 , " so i think the answer is , yes , with many excuses , but you actually broke your promise			0
" ouch ! this was a rare moment of humility			0
in a way , it felt cathartic that after years of making excuses , he finally took responsibility and admitted he failed			0
it revealed @entity9 's vulnerability on the issue			0
i would not be surprised to see that exchange turned into a 30 - second @entity79 ad by the @entity8 campaign			1
here is what mattered most : both candidates recognized the @entity6 vote is crucial and deserves attention			1
it is to the advantage of hispanics not to be taken for granted by one party and ignored by the other			0
hispanics will realize their political power only if courted and engaged by both sides			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : there is a new level of intensity in candidates ' courting of latino vote
she says @entity8 's joke about wishing he were @entity6 makes sense , was not insulting
she says he was able to get *enthusiastic* crowd for @entity7 interview , made good showing
@entity241 : @entity8 would not give straight answer on immigration or deferred action directive
