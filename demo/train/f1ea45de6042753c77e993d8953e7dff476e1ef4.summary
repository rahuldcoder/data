-- @entity1 -- the award - winning mystery writer whose snappy dialogue , misfit characters and laconic sense of humor produced such popular works as " @entity8 , " " @entity9 , " " @entity10 " and " @entity11 " -- has died , according to his literary agent , @entity12			1
the cause of death was not given , but @entity1 had suffered a stroke two weeks ago			1
according to his website , the author died at his home in @entity19 , @entity20			2
@entity1 's succinct writing style -- he favored brief exchanges of dialogue leavened with wit and a keen sense of person and place -- made him a favorite of @entity29 , which turned several @entity1 novels and stories into films and tv programs			1
( the newest @entity1 adaptation , the film " @entity38 , " based on his novel " @entity36 , " will premiere at the @entity37 next month			1
) he was also incredibly prolific			2
at the time of his death , he was at work on his 46th novel			2
grit on wry : a dinner with @entity1 and @entity45 his style went down easy but could be hard to imitate			1
the writers on the tv show " justified , " based on a @entity1 character , wore wristbands with the initials " @entity52 " stamped on them , for " what would @entity53 ? " informed of this , he described it as " flattering			1
" " i have a picture of all them and they 're at their desk and they all have a different book of mine and each one is reading to get my sound , " he told @entity0 last year			0
" that 's very flattering , i 'll tell you			0
" @entity1 was born in @entity68 but raised in @entity20 , where his father worked for @entity70			1
after college , @entity1 went to work for a local advertising agency , where he spent his days writing copy about cars and trucks			1
his nights , however , were devoted to his own work : mainly westerns in the 1950s			1
two of his stories , " @entity82 " and " @entity83 , " were turned into movies			0
but @entity1 kept his advertising job until 1961 , rising at 5 a.m. to write before heading off to work			1
despite his output -- and more movies , including " @entity9 " with @entity89 -- he said he did n't find his style until reading @entity92 ' classic 1970 crime novel , " @entity93			2
" @entity95 ' book , which was turned into a 1973 movie , was almost all dialogue , much of it profane			2
" i read it and i changed my style somewhat , " he told @entity0			0
i started to use expletives where they belonged			0
i started to open my scenes with dialogue			2
" he also spent time with @entity105 homicide detectives , where he continued to hone his ear			0
@entity1 made his mark on film all this came just in time			1
he 'd written one crime novel , " @entity111 , " in 1966			2
despite @entity1 's bona fides , it was rejected 84 times and did n't see the light of day until being made into a 1969 movie			1
the new style gave his books new life -- and new fans			0
when the movies wanted crime stories with offbeat characters and settings , they knew to turn to @entity1			1
" @entity8 " was made into a 1995 film starring @entity127 and @entity128 ; " @entity129 , " a 1992 novel , was turned into @entity132 's 1997 film " @entity133			0
" " @entity11 , " which was made into a 1999 @entity137 film , helped rejuvenate @entity135 's movie career			0
in @entity1 's stories , characters move from scene to scene , cracking wise while they do stupid , violent things			1
he thinks most crooks are dumb , and that dumb is funny			0
he likes a good caper and the violence seems to be almost incidental , more like an occupational hazard			0
the plots feature clever twists ; the narrative style is so spare it reads like haiku			1
the simple beauty of it all can put a bullet through your heart			0
he created some of popular fiction 's most memorable tough guys : trigger - happy federal marshal @entity160 , streetwise @entity29 wannabe @entity161 and smooth talking bank robber @entity162			0
a look inside @entity1 's 45th novel , ' @entity160 ' in recent years , literary types took notice			1
last year , the @entity167 awarded @entity1 the 2012 medal for @entity169 to @entity171 letters in recognition of his fiction			1
" for over five decades , @entity1 's westerns , crime novels , serialized novels , and stories have enthralled generations of readers , " the foundation said in a statement			1
@entity1 also received an @entity183 honor from the @entity184 and a @entity185 , among other distinctions			2
but to @entity1 , writing was just what he did			1
" i do n't have a trade , " he told @entity0			0
" i do n't teach or anything			0
i just love to make up characters and gradually build up a story around them			0
" for example , he said , the " @entity11 " character @entity194 , later the lead of a tv series , was inspired by a newspaper photograph of a shotgun - toting @entity200 marshal			0
writing is rewriting , the old saying goes , and @entity1 -- who wrote first drafts by hand -- would do three pages to get " one clean , typed page with every word in place			1
" the key , he said , was to know when to stop			0
@entity211 advice from the man who wrote a book called " @entity214			2
" " i do n't want it to sound like writing , " he said			2
" leave out the parts people tend to skip			0
" people we 've lost in 2013 @entity0 's @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report			0

he has racked up many awards and won *widespread* *praise* for his work
