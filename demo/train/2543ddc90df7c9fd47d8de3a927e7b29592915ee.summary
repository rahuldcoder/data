when last week he claimedâ € ” in a slam of president @entity8 € ” that president @entity9 cut his vacation short and " immediately went back to the @entity11 " after the @entity12 mistakenly shot down a @entity14 flight in 1983			1
the facts , of course , are nothing like that , and we will get to that in a moment			0
@entity22 is not the only @entity24 figurehead using a rewrite of @entity9 history to attack the president , who opted not to cancel fundraising events the day @entity29 was shot down by the @entity31 rebels			1
hosts on @entity33 also did some editing to the @entity9 narrative			2
and this past weekend on @entity0 's @entity38 , @entity37 chair @entity36 said @entity9 " rallied the world community " with his remarks on the 1983 disaster , without mentioning that half a week had gone by before he delivered them			1
opinion : who will speak for the @entity46 victims ? it is true that , given @entity50 's involvement with supplying the rebels with weapons and the @entity54 ' frosty relationship with @entity55 , the post-crash optics were not good for president @entity56			1
and @entity56 supporters may blame all his administration 's troubles on @entity24 obstructionism and some veiled racism , but the @entity11 's inability to get ahead of the message has also contributed to his dismal 42 % job approval rating			1
( @entity56 , next time , just visit the border			2
) but @entity9 as a role model ? not if you look at the facts : not only did president @entity9 not rush back to @entity69 after the @entity14 disaster , but , according to his press secretary , he went horseback riding later that same day			1
in fact , @entity9 had to be coerced by his inner circle to cut short what had already been a 25 - day vacation in @entity77			2
he did not deliver his much talked about speech in which he condemned the @entity12 for its actions until four days later			0
the fact is that @entity22 's error is no error at all ; it emerged from an airbrushed history that reflects a persistent viewpoint : for many republicans , president @entity9 did no wrong			1
as a result , @entity56 's missteps , real or not , are magnified , distorted			1
it 's like comparing an attractive woman to a photoshopped image of a model			0
in this case , the model who has been nipped , tucked and repackaged is the @entity94			0
consider for example , in 1982 , two years after @entity9 took office , the unemployment rate soared to 9.7 % , the highest since the @entity98			2
it was 9.6 % in 1983 , the year of his 25 - day vacation			0
in january of that year , his approval rating was 35 %			0
in case you were wondering , @entity56 's lowest was 40 %			1
considering how often @entity56 is criticized for his more than 140 rounds of golf , i do n't think i need to tell you what would be said about him if he had taken a month off while the country was dealing with the highest unemployment rate in more than 40 years			1
or if he was approaching anywhere near the 436 vacation days @entity9 tallied in his two terms			2
in fact , @entity9 once joked , " it 's true hard work never killed anyone , but i figure why take the chance ? " i ca n't imagine president @entity56 , who @entity24 openly call lazy , getting away with that			1
i do n't love president @entity9 , but i do n't hate him either			2
opinion : @entity50 's big blunder as with everyone else who has held that office , there are things you can point to that @entity9 did exceptionally well and things i 'm sure he would have liked to have done over			2
there were blemishes : @entity132 and a @entity134 scandal in which millions of federal dollars were criminally funneled to big contributors to @entity24 campaigns , including @entity9 's			1
and @entity9 failed to publicly address the @entity138 crisis until may 1987 , six years after the first cases had appeared			2
thousands died on his watch			0
@entity9 never balanced the budget			0
in fact , he signed the biggest peacetime tax increase in history			0
we can debate why and compare his rationale with that of @entity56 's , but to pretend he did n't do it is ludicrous			1
we become better by learning from mistakes			0
but first we must acknowledge they exist , which is why the continual lionization of @entity9 does the country a disservice			0
rewriting and sugarcoating his history may provide this current brand of @entity24 with a feel - good narrative , and regular , ready - made ways to slam the current president , but it does n't help us learn from the past			1
this week president @entity56 is scheduled to sign an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against @entity166 employees			0
some may be surprised , but @entity9 himself denounced employment discrimination against gays and lesbians more than 30 years ago while governor of @entity77			0
this is all part of his legacy as well			0
@entity2 made a boneheaded error			0
but the biggest error many republicans like him make is scrubbing away @entity9 's errors just so they can throw mud at @entity56			1
it turns their admiration for the @entity94 's " character " into worship of a caricature .			0

@entity185 : some in @entity24 slam @entity56 over @entity46 *reaction* , say @entity9 did better with 1983 @entity189 crash
@entity185 : @entity9 went horseback riding , took 4 days to comment . it 's all part of @entity9 *revisionism*
@entity56 's record *constantly* set against airbrushed *version* of poor @entity9 record , he says
@entity185 : @entity9 had high *jobless* rate , scandals , hiked taxes . we do n't learn from faked history
