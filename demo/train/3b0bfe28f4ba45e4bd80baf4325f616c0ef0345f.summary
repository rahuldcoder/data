@entity0 -- when @entity2 closed out the @entity3 on sunday night by slapping director @entity4 squarely on the backside , that pretty much said it all			1
it was @entity7 in a @entity8			0
yes , the opening routine by @entity2 and @entity10 was very funny ; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners ; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording , the program moved briskly enough			1
but did the orchestra need to follow @entity4 's win of her long - deserved best director prize , for " the @entity23 , " by playing the old @entity25 song " @entity26 " ? when @entity28 and @entity29 arrived on stage to present the @entity32 award , did they have to be intro - ed with " @entity33 " ? and in addition to being groped by @entity2 , did @entity4 have to be so muscled - in - on by her fellow producers when she was picking up the best picture award for her film , " the @entity23 " ? ' the @entity23 ' wins six @entity3 maybe that wacky @entity38 had a point : the producer of " @entity41 " -- which had just won the @entity3 for best documentary short -- barreled on stage , saying " let the woman speak ! " and commandeering the mike from her director , @entity45			1
she provided a classic moment of @entity3 craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes			1
@entity38 seemed boorish , sure			0
but that does n't necessarily make her wrong			2
the @entity54 certainly faced a dilemma this year : vote for the future , or make up for the past			0
years from now , it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that " @entity67 , " one of the biggest movies ever -- and , more importantly , the one that indicates where movies are going -- did n't win the top prize when @entity65 had a chance to bestow it			1
instead , the @entity3 gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize			1
what helped make it all so complicated was not that there 's been a long , long history of overlooked genius female directors that the @entity3 had to atone for			1
the sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct			0
predictably , @entity4 did n't have to be as good as the boys , she had to be better			0
but earning your oscars and actually getting them are two different things			0
fortunately for @entity4 , she had history on her side last night			0
the billions being made by " avatar " will probably be some consolation , but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy , which is what the @entity54 voters like			0
in fact , the big - hearted , sentimental acceptance by best actor @entity99 ( " @entity103 " ) , and the rather elegant , funny remarks by best actress @entity101 ( " @entity102 " ) , are exactly what we all want @entity3 night to be			2
that , and a few good jokes , which is what @entity10 and @entity2 provided , arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring @entity112 that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer @entity113 and the notorious @entity116 / @entity115 musical overture of 1989			1
looking back on @entity3 's ' train wreck ' nothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night , although there were a few moments of bad choices , bad manners and a strategy that was , at best , elusive			2
for all the changing characters and categories on oscar - watchers ' betting pool ballots , there are certain things we bet on no matter what : one , that the show will be interminable ; two , that it will last at least until midnight ( et ) no matter how they try to contain it ; and , three , that there will be moments in the show itself that , although planned by seemingly sane individuals , will be inexplicable , if not grotesque			0
last night did not disappoint			0
while someone like poor @entity149 got drowned out by the orchestra ( after he and @entity145 won best live action short for " @entity147 " ) , the show 's producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable , unspeakable interpretive dance number , this one devoted to the evening 's musical scores			0
more painful , at least to this viewer 's eyes , was an overlong salute to the late director @entity162 , featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players , a few of whom -- @entity167 , for instance , and @entity169 -- looked positively shell shocked			1
the only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category : the @entity178 " @entity177 , " beat out the favored " @entity179 , " thus continuing the @entity3 tradition of giving the foreign - film prize to something few have even seen ( a foreign - film @entity3 does n't do much good , one should remember , for a movie that 's already opened and closed )			1
the other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer @entity182 accepted her " @entity183 " @entity3			2
" i 've already got two of these , " she said , before dissing her coworkers and , by extension , the @entity54 in toto			0
@entity191 dismissal is not a quality @entity3 tolerates very well and it 's not likely ms. @entity182 will be back , unlike @entity10 and @entity2 , who were the funniest @entity3 hosts ever , proving there 's power in numbers , the sum often can be more than the parts , and that it 's always good to have an extra pair of hands , as long as they stay off @entity4 's butt			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity3 had to atone for history of overlooked female directors , says ***critic*** @entity204
@entity10 , @entity2 were the funniest @entity3 hosts ever , says ***critic***
@entity204 : it will look profoundly shortsighted that " @entity67 " did n't win best picture
salute to the late director @entity162 was " overlong , " ***critic*** says
