-- @entity1 , a glasses - free @entity2 handheld video game system , arrives march 27 for $ 249.99			1
@entity3 hopes it will make the strongest case yet for @entity2 special effects affordability and relevance			2
but calling it a gaming console may be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the @entity11 public			1
gaming , it turns out , might be among the least of the system 's capabilities			0
the device will also deliver an array of other fully - connected entertainment experiences , according to @entity3 president @entity19 at the 2011 @entity20			0
from 3 - d movies to tv shows , digital music to augmented reality applications , the company is clearly assigning tremendous importance to non-gaming applications			2
though they wo n't say it directly , @entity3 clearly plans to make the system a trojan horse for the larger world of @entity2 multimedia			1
this should scare the competition			0
it 's an infinitely more practical , and reasonably priced , @entity2 argument than a $ 1500 + hdtv that tethers you to your couch			0
if @entity3 can make this portable device as common and trusted for @entity2 entertainment as smartphones are for e-mail or web surfing , it may single - handedly deliver the breakthrough that carries this technology to mainstream prominence			1
yes , the system will play @entity2 versions of premium game franchises like " @entity51 " and " @entity52 , " says @entity19			1
yes , in the wake of increasing pressure from tens of thousands of readily available free and 99 - cent apps , it will redouble efforts to justify $ 39.99 average software prices by offering " premium experiences you ca n't get anywhere else			0
" but with free @entity71 hotspot availability , @entity64 movie streaming and the ability to create , download and physically interact with @entity2 content among its arsenal of tricks , the company may have yet to play its trump card			0
the system lacks 3g/4g high - speed connectivity , and @entity3 is known for ardently policing material licensed for sale or distribution -- virtually or otherwise -- for its consoles			2
but by letting users view , download and generate a variety of @entity2 material , the system could prove to be the most cost - effective and practical on - demand @entity2 content portal on the market			2
should @entity3 decide to enable sharing of user - generated content or enable the three - camera device for high - speed cellular connectivity and casual videoconferencing , the scope of this potential power play becomes even larger			0
while a dedicated stand - alone gaming system such as the @entity1 ca n't rival smartphones or tablet pcs for sheer ubiquity , consider this : if 3 - d technology takes off the way manufacturers hope , @entity3 's new device may give them an instant entr√©e into entirely new areas of entertainment , a leg up in the race to legitimize @entity2 content and a secret weapon in the war to reclaim the territory recently ceded to @entity113 and its growing gaming focus .			1

@entity1 may be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated , says @entity116
@entity116 : @entity3 wo n't say directly , but system is portal for loads of @entity2 multimedia
the system will play 3 - d versions of premium game franchises like " @entity51 "
