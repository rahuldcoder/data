@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 began his " town hall " event at @entity6 's offices on wednesday with an anecdote			1
" i hate to tell stories about @entity9 , " @entity3 said , referring to @entity6 ceo @entity9 , who was moderating the session			1
as if the two former @entity13 students were old friends , @entity3 then launched into a brief retelling of a dinner party he atttended in february with the 26 - year - old computer whiz and about a dozen other tech - industry elites			1
there , @entity9 sat to the president 's immediate right			1
" i 'm the guy who got @entity9 to wear a jacket and tie , " @entity3 said , referring to @entity9 , who abandoned his usual t - shirt and hoodie ensemble that day			1
" halfway through dinner , he 's starting to sweat a bit			2
it 's really uncomfortable for him			0
i helped him out of his jacket			0
" in fact , if you want @entity9 , we can take our jackets off			2
" and so , like @entity3 has often done during less - formal speeches , the president on wednesday removed his coat			1
@entity9 followed , revealing a dress shirt and black tie			2
( @entity40 , he did wear sneakers			0
) " yeah , you 're a lot better at this than me , " @entity9 joked			0
that kicked off a very cordial hour - long conversation and seemed to loosen up the sometimes chilly technology prodigy			0

" sorry , i 'm kind of nervous , " he said after a flub in his introduction			0
for @entity3 , wednesday was a chance to connect with both @entity53 influencers and young people in one poke			1

" we do n't want them starting @entity73 in @entity74 , or starting @entity73 in @entity75			0
we want them here , " he said			0
to the youthful audience of @entity6 employees , he provided advice and stirred his familiar call for change			0
" @entity82 , part of what makes for a healthy democracy , what is a good politics , is when you have citizens who are informed , who are engaged			0
and what @entity6 allows us to do is make sure this is n't just a one - way conversation , " @entity3 said			1
for @entity6 , the meeting was an opportunity to validate itself in the eyes of @entity96 , where it 's ramped up lobbying efforts recently			1
that 's important for most companies growing at the rate and size @entity6 is			2
@entity9 has already proven himself to 500 million people who use the service and to wealthy investors			0
the @entity6 founder is worth $ 13.5 billion , according to data from @entity108			2
that fact provided an opening for another ribbing from @entity3 , when discussing the president 's proposal for ending tax cuts for the wealthy			1
" people like me and you , @entity9 , ( should be ) paying a little more in taxes , " @entity3 said			1
" i know you 're ok with that			0
" despite the president 's plan to take more of @entity9 's money , the young billionaire praised @entity3 's efforts in education reform			1
" i think that the race to the @entity129 stuff that you guys have done is one of the most under - appreciated and most important things that your administration has done , " @entity9 told the president			2
for his part , @entity9 announced in september that he would donate $ 100 million to @entity136 , @entity137 , public schools			0
@entity3 has commended @entity6 in past speeches , including in his @entity140 in january			1
he placed @entity9 's creation in a pantheon of great @entity144 ingenuity success stories , beside the inventors of the light bulb and the airplane			2
" we 're the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices ; the nation of @entity155 and the @entity156 ; of @entity158 and @entity6 , " @entity3 said in that speech			1
" in @entity144 , innovation does n't just change our lives			0
it is how we make our living			0
" @entity6 indicated in statements leading up to wednesday 's event that this was not an endorsement for the president			1
likewise , @entity169 press secretary @entity168 told reporters on the flight over here that the event was not meant to be a promotion for @entity6			2
" this is not about endorsing a specific company , " @entity168 said			0
" it 's about accepting an invitation for a forum to speak to the @entity144 people			0
" people traveling on @entity182 watched " @entity183 , " the controversial movie about the founding of @entity6 , @entity168 said			0
@entity6 did , however , offer a gift to @entity3 at the end of the event			1
