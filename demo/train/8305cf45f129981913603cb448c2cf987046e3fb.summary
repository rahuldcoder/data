one video shows more than 100 prisoners paraded across the desert in their underwear , then lying face down as militants unleash a hailstorm of bullets into their bodies			2
other images show crucifixions and public executions in towns overrun by terrorists			0
and recent footage showing the beheading of a second @entity17 journalist proves that @entity18 wants the world to know how brutal it can be			1
the insurgents are experts at using footage of their crimes as propaganda to terrify those who disagree with their radicalism and to threaten foreign leaders			0
the visuals are as much a part of @entity18 ' terrorism as its bloody march across the @entity30 and @entity31			1
in the video of @entity17 @entity35 's decapitation , the executioner has a stern warning for the @entity17 president : " i 'm back , @entity41 , and i 'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the @entity43 , " the man says in the video , released just days after fellow journalist @entity40 was beheaded			1
" just as your missiles continue to strike our people , our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people			1
" even a 7 - year - old child was photographed holding a severed head			2
the picture was reportedly taken in @entity53 , the @entity18 stronghold in @entity31 , where the boy 's @entity55 father had taken his family to join the fight			1
more decapitations publicized beheadings had actually stopped in years past a decade ago , @entity61 -- the terror group that spawned @entity18 -- made headlines with a series of decapitations , including those of @entity17 @entity66 and @entity67			1
@entity69 official @entity68 criticized the gruesome antics , and the decapitations stopped			0
but @entity61 has since disowned @entity18 , and @entity68 has not condemned @entity40 's execution			1
that means the beheadings could continue			1
but it 's not just @entity76 captives who fall victim			0
last week , a @entity79 man was executed in front of a mosque in @entity82 in a video called " a message written in blood , " notes @entity86 , @entity87 researcher at the @entity88			0
but because that message " was directed at the president of @entity92 , this particular piece of propaganda did not receive widespread coverage in the international media , " @entity86 wrote in a piece for @entity90			2
" they have shown their willingness to kill anyone in their path -- not just @entity17 , not just @entity104 , but @entity30 of all faiths , of all sects , " @entity98 spokeswoman @entity97 said			0
" they 've shown their complete barbarism in doing that			0
" the media 's role @entity86 said the media has a responsibility to treat @entity18 propaganda carefully			1
" every time a still or clip from an @entity18 video is shown , the group gets what it wants : the oxygen of publicity , " he wrote			1
" of course , it is necessary that people the world over are aware of the atrocities occurring at the hands of @entity18 , but journalists must be careful not to do the jihadists ' job for them			1
" the decision on whether to publicize parts of the recent beheading videos have even divided journalists			2
international broadcaster @entity133 said it had decided not to show any images of @entity35 from the video -- a more conservative position than other tv networks			0
" we suggest all media do the same , " @entity133 's public relations account said via @entity139 , using the hashtag # @entity140			2
and while the video has been blocked from various video sharing platforms , they have also reappeared as many times , @entity88 senior researcher @entity143 wrote			0
she said that kind of trend " once again emphasizes that the new frontline for counter-terrorist practitioners is online extremism			0
" glossy recruitment tools part of the problem is the radicals are extremely tech - and media savvy			1
" we are way behind			0
they are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies , social media , when it comes to video production qualities , and in disseminating their propaganda over the @entity169 , " said @entity164 , a former jihadi and author of " radical : my journey out of @entity171			1
" some videos used by the terrorists rival the production quality of @entity176 films			1
one hourlong video shows a collection of bombings , executions , kidnappings and beheadings			2
as one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky , two men in the background of the video chuckle			0
the recruitment tactics can be both blatant and subtle			0
for about $ 10 , supporters can buy a shirt with @entity18 ' logo and phrases such as , " we are all @entity18 " and " @entity196 , until the @entity197			1
" and it may be no accident that a militant with a @entity202 accent fronted the video of @entity40 's death			0
that kind of tactic could inspire more foreign jihadists , a former @entity18 fighter told @entity90			2
" it is possible that the goal was to project the image that a @entity212 , or a @entity76 person , executed an @entity17 so that they can showcase their @entity76 members and appeal to others outside @entity31 and make them feel that they belong to the same cause			0
" @entity218 : where do jihadis come from ?			0

@entity18 militants are getting *increasingly* tech - and media savvy
