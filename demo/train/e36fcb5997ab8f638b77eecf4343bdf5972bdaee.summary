-- after an unexpected loss in the @entity4 primary , former house majority leader @entity1 resigned from @entity5 and nabbed the brass ring : a lucrative vice chairmanship at boutique investment firm @entity8 , along with a slot on its board of directors			1
the ex-representative for @entity13 's 7th @entity12 will be making at least $ 1.6 million next year in addition to a hefty signing bonus			2
the revolving door to @entity17 is a fact of political life in @entity20 and wo n't change anytime soon			1
that 's still no excuse for ignoring it			0
according to the @entity24 , at least a dozen lawmakers have left public office since 2007 to work for @entity17 firms with a lobbying presence in @entity20 -- often heading up their @entity20 operations , as @entity1 will be doing			1
but if the only result is that former congressional members are handsomely rewarded for their expertise , then what 's the harm ? the problem is that they 're not hired for their expertise in finance ; they may not even know much of anything about investment banking or finance			2
they 're hired to influence legislation by making introductions and giving the kind of insider advice that nobody , not even the best - connected @entity49 , have			0
people like @entity1 are not technically lobbyists , but they are expected to use their knowledge as former insiders to strategize for their new employers about how to navigate @entity5 and who they need to lobby in order to pass , kill or -- as is most typical -- stall legislation			1
in short , they can help devise the plan to shepherd their new employer 's agenda through @entity62			0
what @entity1 will do for @entity8 merits scrutiny because the ability to hire a marquee name like @entity1 means that his new bosses and shareholders have a substantial leg up , not just on the competition , but on civil servants whose job it is to produce policy that serves the public rather than private interest			1
of course , the perspectives of companies like @entity8 are legitimate and useful and should never be censored			0
companies providing more information to policymakers is ideal , as long as it 's not deceptive or misleading			0
@entity82 's take on @entity1 : we told you so however , members of @entity5 are continually pitched by the special interests on which they depend on to fund their re-election efforts			1
they receive expert opinions polished and shaped for their easy adoption from the very people who are supplying their campaign cash			2
both sides have serious conflicts of interest			0
if members of @entity5 want to know how positions favored by various interests would affect their district , state or the national interest , they have to do their own due diligence by hunting down a source for credible , expert , unbiased research or produce it themselves			2
they may not hear from their constituents , especially on arcane issues that pit one industry against another			2
in addition , they face time pressures , reduced committee and office budgets as well as limited staff and resources			0
so it should be no surprise that @entity5 is an easy mark for a former member to not only navigate but exploit			0
@entity17 bosses expect that former @entity20 movers and shakers on their payroll will offer access and a shortcut to success , if not outright deliver , on their clients ' agendas			1
what people like @entity1 could do is end up serving themselves and their employer at the risk of doing a huge disservice to their former constituents			1
if the money outweighs all other concerns , the broader public interest rarely wins			0
elected officials and the staff that help them keep up with complex issues are largely driven , we hope and expect , by a desire to make a difference in the world			0
the revolving door lures them away from the public service to work on behalf of elite interests that are elite , in part , because they 're already investing big money to play the @entity153			1
let 's hope in his new role , @entity1 is merely the well - paid vip shown off to impress clients , and not also required to put his thumb on the scale on their behalf .			1
