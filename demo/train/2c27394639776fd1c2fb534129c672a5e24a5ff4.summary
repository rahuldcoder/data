no troops to @entity1 , but other options are being considered			2
that was president @entity5 's message friday in response to the lightning advance by @entity9 militant fighters in @entity1 that could threaten the government of @entity13 prime minister @entity12			1
in a statement delivered from the @entity15 , @entity5 said the @entity17 " will not be sending @entity17 troops back into combat in @entity1 , " but that he would be reviewing a range of other options in coming days			1
" this is not going to happen overnight , " the president said , adding that unless @entity1 fixes its internal political problems , short - term military help from the @entity17 wo n't make much difference			1
critics blame @entity5 for @entity1 crisis pressure for the @entity17 to provide military support to @entity1 's struggling government has increased , with conservative republicans blaming @entity5 for creating a security vacuum in 2011 by pulling out @entity17 troops			1
@entity34 critics also say that @entity5 's unwillingness to provide significant military backing to opposition forces in @entity39 's civil war has contributed to the ability of the @entity41 in @entity1 and @entity39 , or @entity42 , to attack in @entity1			1
@entity5 , however , resists getting drawn into another military engagement there after the ending the nine - year conflict started by his predecessor			2
now the conflict threatens to widen			0
@entity48 officials denied reports friday that some of its elite forces were in @entity1 to help bolster @entity12 , a fellow @entity13			0
@entity39 connection taking questions from reporters after his statement , @entity5 acknowledged that the @entity39 civil war has been spilling over into @entity1 " for some time now , " adding that the regional conflict " is going to be a long - term problem			1
" perhaps sensitive to the criticism over the @entity39 link , @entity5 and other government officials referred to the @entity9 militant group by the acronym @entity42 , which stands for @entity42			0
the president called on @entity1 's neighbors to help out , too , but made clear the only guarantee of success involved political reforms by @entity12 that promoted cooperation with @entity71			2
" in the absence of this type of political effort , short - term military action , including any assistance we might provide wo n't succeed , " @entity5 said			1
@entity5 also blamed @entity1 's political dysfunction for the failure of its troops to fight off the @entity42 advance from the north to within about 60 miles of @entity83 on friday			1
he noted the @entity17 has given plenty of aid and training to @entity1 forces -- including $ 15 billion for items such as @entity89 , assault rifles and helicopters , not to mention another $ 1 billion in arms now in a 30 - day review period in @entity94			1
" the fact that they are not willing to stand and fight and defend their posts against admittedly hardened terrorists , but not terrorists who are overwhelming in numbers , indicates that there is a problem with morale , a problem in terms of commitment , and ultimately that is rooted in the political problems that have plagued the country for a very long time , " @entity5 said			0
@entity9 divisions @entity112 , a former senior @entity113 official in the @entity115 administration , told @entity116 that " it 's up to @entity12 to change policy on how he treats with , how he deals with the @entity9 community			0
" " i 'm skeptical , because right now he 's in a fight for his life , " @entity112 said			0
underlying the @entity17 concern is the potential threat of an @entity42 - controlled stronghold in the region that could serve as a staging ground for terrorist activity against @entity17 interests			0
@entity42 fighters already have seized @entity1 's second - largest city , @entity133 , while gaining control of large parts of the country 's north			0
@entity112 warned the conflict could result in @entity1 dividing into three pieces -- a @entity9 - controlled north , a @entity9 - controlled south and a @entity143 region			0
@entity144 , a former @entity145 official who is @entity116 's national security analyst , said @entity42 could " sow chaos through the @entity148 , " and was " definitely " a threat to the @entity17			0
surprising speed the speed of the deterioration of the situation in @entity1 surprised even @entity17 officials closely monitoring the country , a @entity17 official closely involved with military decision - making told @entity116 's @entity157			1
" we 've been watching the intelligence continually and the fractures in @entity1 that have grown as a result of the underlying political environment and lack of inclusive governance , " the @entity17 official said			1
" if anything was surprising , it 's only the speed at which the situation continued to deteriorate over the past few days and the apparent ease at which the ( @entity1 security forces ) abandoned their units and positions			2
" meanwhile , a @entity17 counterterrorism official noted the intelligence community had warned of a growing @entity42 threat to @entity133 and @entity83			0
the official told @entity116 that the group , consisting of a few thousand fighters , " could n't have moved as rapidly as it has without the support of some @entity179 groups and sympathetic tribes			0
" " as long as the support of these @entity9 elements holds , @entity42 looks well - positioned to keep the territory it has captured , absent a major counteroffensive , " the official said , using the same acronym for the group as @entity5			2
the @entity193 is preparing options for @entity5 to consider that would halt the momentum of the @entity42 advance , @entity192 spokesman rear adm. @entity191 told reporters			0
preparations ? a @entity17 official told @entity116 on friday that the @entity17 plans to move the aircraft carrier @entity202 into the @entity203 to provide @entity5 with options for possible airstrikes			1
calls for @entity17 airstrikes have increased in @entity208 , but @entity17 military planners trying to find a way to help @entity1 fend off the militant fighters are worried that such attacks could prove futile , several officials told @entity116			1
among other complications , @entity17 officials do n't have good intelligence about where militants are			1
even if they did , the militants do n't have the type of targets -- command and control centers , air defense sites , military bases -- that lend themselves to aerial attacks , the officials said on condition of not being identified			1
they also noted that @entity42 fighters may be spread out inside population centers , which means airstrikes could risk civilian casualties and property destruction at the hands of the @entity17 military			2
so even if @entity5 decides on airstrikes , the @entity17 does n't currently have targets to hit , administration sources told @entity116 's @entity236			1
figuring out what to go after will take time			0
the president appeared to allude to such challenges when he said : " we want to make sure that we 've gathered all the intelligence that 's necessary so that if , in fact , i do direct an order , any actions there ( are ) targeted , they 're precise , and they 're going to have an effect			0
" @entity250 strikes ' not easy ' @entity34 sen. @entity251 of @entity252 , a war veteran and critic of @entity5 administration policy in @entity1 , also spoke to this point friday , telling @entity116 that air strikes " are certainly something that should be considered , but i would point out that air strikes are not easy			1
" " you just do n't say , ' hey , let 's go hit something , ' " said @entity251 , who lost to @entity5 in the 2008 presidential election			2
" it requires coordination , it requires intelligence ; it requires a whole lot of things			0
" one @entity17 official told @entity116 that short of sending ground troops , options under consideration included increasing @entity17 surveillance flights over @entity42 areas and potential airstrikes			0
at the @entity193 , @entity191 said the @entity17 already had intensified its intelligence support in @entity1 at the request of @entity12 's government			1
however , @entity278 , the @entity17 ambassador to @entity1 from 2010 to 2012 who is now a fellow at the @entity279 , characterized @entity1 's military as " ill - trained , badly led and not particularly competent			1
" " they clearly can not fire and maneuver , " said @entity278 , a @entity281 veteran			0
@entity251 called for @entity5 to fire his national security team , saying the decision to withdraw all @entity17 troops from @entity1 created a predictable vacuum that led to the current crisis			1
to @entity251 , a residual force of @entity17 troops should have remained in @entity1 to provide stability , " the same kind of residual force that we have now in @entity291 , that we have in @entity292 , we have in @entity293			1
" " that does n't mean we 're in combat			0
it means we are there as a stabilizing force , " he said , adding that the @entity42 advance represents " an existential threat " to @entity17			0
he linked the @entity1 situation to the administration 's reluctance to strongly support opposition forces in @entity39 's civil war , a policy he called " one of the causative factors " for the @entity1 crisis			0
secretary of state @entity314 , however , cited differences in @entity17 relations and obligations with @entity1 compared to @entity39			2
the @entity1 war that began with the 2003 invasion to oust @entity320 eventually led to elections that brought @entity12 to power , followed by the 2011 departure of @entity17 forces			2
" in @entity1 , there is a government that we have been deeply involved in , that we support , that we have a military relationship with , that we have an ongoing memorandum of understanding regarding the military relationship which has invited us , asked us for help , " he said			2
who is the @entity42 ? 5 predictions revisited : @entity1 's troubles are years in the making recording : @entity42 promises more fighting in more @entity1 cities			0

sources : @entity17 does n't even have airstrike targets , should @entity5 ok them
president @entity5 says a decision on military help will take days
@entity1 militants look positioned to hold onto gains
