-- moms everywhere like to ask their unmarried daughters dreaded questions like : why are you still single ? are you married yet ? anyone catch your eye ? especially around @entity7			1
sure , we 've seen @entity9 agonize over the issue , watched @entity12 ' awkwardness around it , heard @entity15 's lamentations au @entity16 , and we 've even heard from the lovable @entity20 vis - a - vis her @entity19 - @entity18 perspective			0
but , we have n't heard the modern @entity23 woman 's story			1
being an unmarried @entity23 woman in her childbearing years is like being a manicurist with a hand tremor : very odd and rather tricky			1
she is expected to marry early and marry well			2
@entity23 mothers , then , are in a deep crisis			1
they immigrated to the @entity18 with the hopes that their daughters would get a good education and fulfill the @entity32			2
but they never considered that , along with having all that modernity , their daughters would , like the rest of @entity18 's young , empowered women , be so " late " in marriage			1
granted , @entity23 moms are not alone in their hopes			1
but still , some of them seem particularly affected			0
what shall they do ? well , first , they might accept that their daughters have not just a " double consciousness , " as @entity45 termed it , but rather infinite consciousnesses , complicating their very blackness			0
if an upper middle - class girl has one or more @entity23 parents , for example , she has likely schooled in the @entity18 or @entity52 -- maybe even a generation after her own parents have			1
and she has likely spent a fair amount of time in @entity56 via @entity57 , a common lifestyle practice for those of formerly colonized @entity23 countries			1
if she has lived down @entity61 , say in @entity62 , for some time , she has likely acquired a @entity64 twang for survival sake			0
if she has taken up a neuroscience residency in @entity69 ( which , of course , she must , if she is @entity23 ) , she might now sound like @entity71 's sister			1
and the minute she wins an accolade in some not - so - diverse department ( which , of course , she must , being @entity23 ) , she 'll be labeled the " first @entity75 " to have done so			1
in short , she is global			0
if she is living in a melting pot like @entity77 , she is global on steroids			0
naturally , global girls outgrow such local traditions as arranged marriages , dowry and bride price , which have not been exclusive to @entity23 tradition ( see the @entity85 period drama , " @entity86 " ) but have certainly lingered longer in homes of @entity23 descent			1
@entity23 moms need to accept that globalism has allowed their daughters to know the world better , and as a result , seek partnerships more wisely			1
this process of self - determination takes a tad longer to form than setting up an arranged marriage			0
thankfully , my mom , educated in @entity18 , a @entity77 and rather global , has not been as insistent on marriage with me			1
but it seems like only yesterday her older sister , my aunt , warned about the dangers of waiting too long , or being too educated , to be married			2
really , if you 've watched @entity105 's blunt character , @entity106 , in " @entity86 , " you have watched my aunt			0
despite being an accomplished woman who acquired a ph.d. later in life , she praised my graceful exit from my doctoral program			0
i 'd just turned 21 when i 'd chosen a rather eccentric doctoral study			0
in her words : " what man would marry a 20 - something - year - old ph.d. - holder ? " it would be too intimidating to men			2
" i 'd do better to tone it down a bit , " she suggested			0
which brings me to my second plea to @entity23 moms			1
if you want your daughter to be as happy or happier than you have been in marriage , it makes no sense that she should dumb down the colorfulness of her character , the boldness of her spirit and the fire that made her the " first african - american " this or that in order to appease those who are potentially intimidated by her			2
if you 'd never match a conservative @entity140 with a flagrant porn star , it 's not clear why today 's educated woman should edit herself in hopes of attracting a feeble idiot			2
yes , she 'd be married , but then she 'd live only to repress herself for someone else 's ego -- and what kind of message would that be for the children ? you see , dear @entity23 moms , global girls need global boys			1
we can sit and try to make sense of why one kind of match would work or not work for a global girl , but we must concede that love is messy and unpredictable			2
love is not like your daughter 's medical career with a blueprint to follow , or like a gps map that can calculate the distance between @entity168 and @entity169			0
yesterday 's woman wanted marriage			2
today 's woman wants love -- and marriage , if it turns out that way			1
@entity177 's character in the tv series " scandal " spoke quite unapologetically for today 's woman when she said : " i could probably give all this up , and live in a country house and have babies and be normal			0
but i do n't want to			0
i 'm not built for it			0
i do n't want normal and easy ... and simple			0
i want ... painful , difficult ... devastating ... life - changing ... extraordinary love			0
" @entity187 love ? sometimes , dear @entity23 moms , that process is just a little more complicated than marrying your cousin like in the 18th century			1
so , you 'll just have to be patient			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity194 : moms everywhere like to ask their daughters why they *'re* not married
@entity194 : being an unmarried @entity23 woman is tricky and odd
she says when women are more educated and global , they do n't just settle and marry
@entity194 : modern @entity23 women want love and marriage , and not " intimidated " men
