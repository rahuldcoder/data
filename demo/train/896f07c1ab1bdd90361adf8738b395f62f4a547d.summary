-- who do you think you are , @entity3 ? all this complaining and demanding you have been doing lately is making you look even more mouthy and angry than usual			2
it was bad enough that you exploded over the casting of @entity7 as @entity8 in the upcoming @entity10 movie , but then you went and started a petition to recast " @entity12 " because @entity13 and @entity14 just did n't do it for you			1
backlash much ? now there are screeches about the cast of this season 's " @entity18			1
" the target of ire this time around is mostly " @entity22 " star @entity21 who has been labeled a " ringer " because he happens to know how to dance thanks to his role as " @entity25 " in the aforementioned tv movies and film as well as some time spent on @entity28			2
fans not happy with ' @entity12 ' casting to be fair , fellow " dwts " contestant and " @entity40 " star @entity39 has also been targeted for knowing how to dance , though it 's almost surely not because of her starring role in the now cult classic " showgirls			1
" " it 's not fair ! " stage producer @entity41 told @entity43			2
" they have the muscle memory about the ways to do this			2
i think it 's dishonest that ( the show does n't ) level the playing field			0
" could it be that fans are now drunk with power after their successes ? over the years campaigns from the distraught have saved television shows like " @entity59 , " " @entity60 , " " @entity61 " and " @entity62			1
" these days folks can also vote with their dollars and make things happen			1
really missing " @entity68 " and wish there was a reunion movie ? kickstarter to the rescue and it is happening			0
according to that company , 10 % of the films at @entity72 last year were @entity69 funded			0
is there a movie you want to see not playing in your town ? you can always hop on @entity79 and make a showing happen			0
couple this with the power of social media , which , because it allows users to share their opinions freely and have massive interaction with others , apparently heightens the sense of influence and power			0
before you know it there 's a recipe for rebellion			0
no place is this more obvious than over on the " @entity12 " @entity98 page			1
to say people are unhappy over this @entity12 / @entity12 casting would be an understatement			1
' @entity12 ' : before @entity13 and @entity14 , was there @entity103 ? " no chance , " wrote @entity98 user @entity104 about @entity13 's casting			1
" he does not have the right face ... he looks like he belongs in movies like @entity109 or 300 , not as @entity12 , and he looks a hell of a lot older than 27 ( the character 's age when the book begins ) , just saying ! " " they are not right for it , " wrote @entity115 of @entity13 and @entity14 's casting			1
" period , will not be watching the movie			0
" there are already calls for a boycott of " @entity12 " before a scene has even been filmed			1
the furor caused the film 's producer , @entity124 , to feel the need to explain how casting works			2
' " there is a lot that goes into casting that is n't just looks , " the @entity128 reported @entity124 as saying			2
" talent , availability , their desire to do it , chemistry with the other actor , etc. so if your favorite was n't cast , then it is most likely due to something on that list			0
keep that in mind while hating and keep perspective			0
" so can you please dial it back a bit , @entity3 , and perhaps pick and choose your battles ? after all , there are brand new " @entity152 " judges to be criticized and @entity151 is sure to twerk again			0
you know , the important stuff .			0

fans are *roaring* even *louder* and more often these days
" @entity18 " is the latest to suffer backlash
" @entity12 " casting continues to press *buttons*
