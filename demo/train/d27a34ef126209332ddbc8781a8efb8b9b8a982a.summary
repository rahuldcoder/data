add @entity0 and @entity1 to the rapidly growing list of states to have their same - sex marriage bans tossed out in definitive fashion			1
a ruling by a federal appeals court tuesday adds further momentum -- and a degree of inevitably -- to the idea of a civil marriage for gays and lesbians becoming a reality in a majority of @entity18 states			0
three judges from the 9th @entity20 in @entity21 concluded the bans in the two western states violated the equal protection rights of same - sex couples to legally marry			1
" the lessons of our constitutional history are clear : inclusion strengthens , rather than weakens , our most important institutions , " said the judges			0
" when same - sex couples are married , just as when opposite - sex couples are married , they serve as models of loving commitment to all			1
" the decision comes after the @entity38 on monday let stand rulings striking down bans in five states and affecting similar laws in six others			2
that means that in coming weeks , 32 states could allow same - sex marriage , an increase of 13 states since the beginning of the month			1
@entity50 and @entity51 announced tuesday they would order county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples			1
the decisions affecting @entity1 and @entity0 become the fourth such federal appeals court action to strike down voter - approved bans			2
state senator pops the question after @entity0 's gay marriage ban falls one of the original @entity1 plaintiffs cheered the decision			2
" it means so much for the courts to recognize our family and say that we must be treated equally , " said @entity64 , who wed @entity65 in @entity66 in 2011			2
their home state does not recognize their legal union			0
" our son will be able to grow up in a world where the state treats his family the same as other families			0
today 's ruling means that we can finally have the same legal protections as other married couples and the security of knowing that our family is legally secure			1
" but advocates on both sides of the issue are waiting to see what a federal appeals court in @entity88 will decide on bans in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
oral arguments by a judicial panel in august by the @entity97 suggested those bans may be upheld , in contrast to a nationwide trend over the past 15 months			0
a ruling there is expected any day			0
a potential " circuit split " may prove the impetus for the @entity18 @entity38 to ultimately decide whether same - sex couples nationwide have a constitutional right to tie the knot			1
by refusing to get involved now , the justices this week let stand appeals court rulings that immediately opened up the right to those in @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity51 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
because neighboring states are covered by the appeals court 's jurisdiction , same - sex marriage could be extended in coming weeks to @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity115 and @entity124			1
the high court 's deliberate move to stand off to the side may indicate its natural instincts to go slowly -- to allow hot - button issues like his one to develop on their own , without interference from nine unelected justices			0
but the individual members of the bench may have also done some internal head counting and concluded with a shaky 5 - 4 conservative - liberal divide -- and moderate - conservative @entity138 the potential swing vote -- the final outcome was too uncertain to put same - sex marriage on the docket now			1
the cases in the 9th @entity145 's decision are @entity146 v. @entity147 ( 12 - 17668 ) in @entity0 and @entity148 v. @entity149 ( 14 - 35420 ) in @entity1 .			0

@entity20 says same - sex marriage bans violate equal protection rights
@entity154 says she feels like her family can feel " legally secure "
decision is part of a trend *overturning* bans , but another circuit may soon uphold them
if circuit courts issue different decisions , the @entity38 may get back in the *mix*
