-- @entity2 's high commissioner to @entity3 has blamed criticism of his country 's human rights record on a " proxy propaganda war " being carried out by those who funded the nation 's " terrorist conflict			1
" the prime ministers of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 have withdrawn from the @entity15 , or @entity15 , beginning in @entity16 on friday , amid concerns about the rights situation in @entity2 after its 26 - year civil war with separatist @entity21 rebels			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity23 for the " @entity27 " show on the eve of the summit , @entity22 said he was unsurprised by the criticism			0
" one has to understand that there 's a tremendous influence from those who funded the terrorist conflict who are now carrying out , really , a proxy propaganda war			1
" what we realize is that over the years -- as people realize the wonderful reconciliation , rehabilitation and reconstruction program that we are carrying out in @entity2 -- that gradually that proxy propaganda war will lose its currency and , in that context , i think it 's entirely right and fitting that we should host the @entity15 , " he said			1
" there 's a huge dichotomy of disjuncture between what is said abroad in terms of criticism and lack of rights and the freedom and the justice and equality that people are experiencing here			2
" the @entity15 is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the @entity60			0
its charter focuses on developing " free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the @entity15			0
" heads of member governments meet every two years			0
international investigation asked about calls for an independent , international investigation into alleged war crimes -- a call repeated by @entity60 foreign secretary @entity75 when he met his @entity2 counterpart on the sidelines of the meeting this week -- @entity22 responded : " we do n't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years			2
we have perfectly educated people and i think we 're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry			0
" @entity22 said the leaders not attending the conference represent three of the five countries that are home to @entity2 's largest , wealthiest and strongest diaspora communities			1
" each country , each leader has their domestic political considerations			0
after all , they 're politicians , " he said			0
he described @entity3 opposition leader @entity97 's call for @entity2 to be stripped of its chairmanship of the @entity15 as " extremely silly " and uninformed , saying his country had made " enormous progress " since its war ended in may 2009			1
" we cherish the principles of democracy and development -- the twin pillars of the @entity15 , " @entity22 said			0
" we are a very decent , very human group of people			0
we 've had a terrible conflict with the terrorists -- finally the people of @entity2 are free			0
" civilian deaths as many as 70,000 people were killed in @entity2 's war and in its final stage , which lasted from september 2008 to may 2009 , the @entity2 army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting			1
a @entity119 report in 2011 said the government used " large - scale and widespread shelling " that left a large number of civilians dead			0
the number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day , and @entity119 figures greatly differ from those in reports from @entity2 's government and various nongovernmental organizations			1

on october 7 , @entity12 prime minister @entity143 announced that he would not go to this week 's meeting and that @entity145 -- the parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs and for international human rights -- would attend in his place			1
@entity12 is " deeply concerned " about the situation in @entity2 and believes that the government has failed to uphold the @entity15 's core values , he said			1
" the absence of accountability for the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian standards during and after the civil war is unacceptable , " @entity143 said			1
" @entity12 noted with concern the impeachment of the @entity2 chief justice earlier this year and we remain disturbed by ongoing reports of intimidation and incarceration of political leaders and journalists , harassment of minorities , reported disappearances , and allegations of extra judicial killings			2
" on november 12 , the prime minister of mauritius , @entity172 , told lawmakers that he would not be attending the summit , sending his minister of foreign affairs instead			0
a government statement said @entity172 told the country 's parliament that he had been monitoring human rights in @entity2 and was gravely concerned about violations there			1
" @entity13 has never been and will never be indifferent to the human rights violation anywhere in the world , including @entity2 , " he said			1

external affairs minister @entity193 was chosen to represent @entity14 instead			0
@entity193 told @entity0 's @entity23 on " @entity27 " thursday that a number of factors may have influenced the decision to stay away , including coming elections and economic issues			0
" and of course there were competing sentiments in the country about some outstanding issues with @entity2 , particularly on the rehabilitation and reconstruction that 's imperative after the end of the war , " he said			2
" we have urged the government of @entity2 to take steps forward towards real and meaningful devolution and accountability			0
" he said @entity14 continues to urge speedier action but said : " we ca n't see an alternative to engagement , particularly if it 's a matter that concerns a friendly country in the neighborhood of @entity14			2
" the @entity2 website says that @entity133 " expressed satisfaction over @entity14 external affairs minister @entity193 attending the @entity15 summit			1
when an @entity14 reporter stated that prime minister @entity191 has skipped the conference in acceding to demands made by @entity224 , the president said that he has not informed this to him and pointed out that the @entity14 prime minister did not even attend the previous summit in @entity230 two years ago			2
" ' must be accountability ' @entity60 prime minister @entity232 , who is attending the summit , issued a statement thursday saying he sees it as " an opportunity to raise our concerns clearly and directly , and to focus the eyes of the world on @entity2			0
" " together we must say clearly to the government of @entity2 -- our hosts -- that there must be accountability for the past and respect for human rights today , " he said			1
" four years on from the end of the civil war and defeat of the ' @entity253 , ' a brutal terrorist organization , there has been nowhere near enough improvement			0
we need to see more progress : genuine freedom of expression and the media , an end to the intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders , action to stamp out torture , demilitarization of the north and reconciliation between communities			2
