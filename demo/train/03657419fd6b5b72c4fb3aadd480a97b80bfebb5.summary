editor 's note : @entity2 is @entity3 and professor of law , policy and society at @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity9 has written 17 books , including a forthcoming volume , " @entity12 on campus : from @entity14			1
" @entity2 says a " person of interest " has n't been implicated in a crime -- at least not yet			1
( @entity17 ) -- the intense public interest surrounding the september 8th disappearance of 24 - year - old @entity28 graduate student @entity26 has , since the discovery of her body last sunday inside a wall of the laboratory building where she had been working , shifted over to a male lab technician who was described by @entity31 @entity30 as a " person of interest			1
" in a formal court of law , the distinction between suspect and " person of interest " is as fundamental as the assumption of innocence prior to evidence of guilt			1
in the informal court of public opinion , however , the distinction is so badly blurred that the good name and reputation of truly innocent people have often been ruined			2
many @entity48 will recall the name of @entity50 , who police and many news organizations called a person of interest following the @entity55 bombing			1
he was completely innocent and settled out - of - court with several news outlets for defamation of character			2
[ @entity1 's note : @entity17 settled with @entity50 for an undisclosed amount but maintained its coverage was fair and accurate			0
] as a security guard stationed near the explosion site , @entity50 was in the right place to uncover evidence but in the wrong place for appearing above suspicion			0
similarly , a @entity68 , @entity70 man , once described in the local media as a " person of interest " in an ongoing investigation of the @entity75 serial killing spree , was later awarded $ 30,000 as settlement for his lawsuit against three area news organizations			1
the historical timeline related to the scarlet " i " ( for interest ) does not extend very far			0
it is hard to imagine sgt. @entity85 of the old but classic dragnet tv drama saying to his partner , " this fella seems like a person of interest			1
" but , of course , just - the - facts - ma'am @entity85 would n't have speculated about possible investigative leads , at least not to the media			0
curiosity about the now often - used designation involves more than just the fact that " person of interest " was not part of law enforcement vernacular a few decades ago			1
it is more that the thick blue line that distanced the cops and their investigations from the press as agents for an insatiable public has eroded in an age of instantaneous information , satellite - broadcasted -- and @entity106 replayed -- press briefings , and crime - oriented cable news programs			0
police investigators have long differentiated suspects from subjects			0
suspects may include those arrested for a crime or a person still at large for whom an arrest warrant has been issued			0
in either case , there is probable cause to pursue criminal prosecution			0
in contrast , a subject is someone who warrants investigation by virtue of his / her relationship to a victim or proximity / access to a crime scene but who has not , at least so far , been implicated in the crime			0
that is , the subject designation leads to a police investigation , while the suspect designation results from one			0
often times , the list of subjects in a continuing investigation can be extensive , but rarely is that true of the list of suspects			0
the subject - suspect distinction may have worked fine in the days before the press was all over police investigators like flies at a picnic			0
to avoid confusion from the sound - alike terms suspect and subject , the alternative phrase " person of interest " has become increasingly commonplace -- a creation for the media , if not by the media			1
unfortunately , even without the linguistic similarity , the important distinction between person of interest and suspect is too often lost on most @entity48			1
the arrest of @entity161 in connection with the murder of ms. @entity164 may officially signal a move from interest to suspicion			2
however , the recklessness of publicly naming persons of interest , even if it eventually leads to an arrest , does not serve the interests of justice			2
while it is hardly necessary to return to the " just the facts " days of close - lipped cops , a moratorium on releasing and publicizing the identities of persons of interest before and until they become persons of suspicion may be the wisest and fairest approach			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : " person of interest " is a relatively new term
he says term describes someone who is n't officially a suspect at this point
@entity9 : some prominent persons of interest have been proved innocent
he says identity of persons of interest should be *withheld*
