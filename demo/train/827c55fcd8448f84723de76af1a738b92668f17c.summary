-- the new version of @entity3 's mobile operating system , @entity2 7 , was released september 18 to mostly positive reviews			1
it was the biggest change to @entity6 since it was introduced six years ago , overhauled to add a slate of new features and a more streamlined , flat , abstract look			0
but nobody 's perfect , right ? it 's not unusual for new operating systems to have some glitches in their earliest days			1
nobody 's talking about anything cataclysmic this time , like the @entity16 fiasco on @entity2 that led ceo @entity17 to issue a rare apology -- and which some say led to the ouster of @entity3 senior vice president @entity21			1
but a couple of weeks into its existence , @entity22 has prompted a handful of complaints from users			2
here are five of the most frequently heard , along with tips for how to fix , or at least bypass , them			2
@entity32 failing @entity3 says it 's aware of an issue that 's causing texts sent through its @entity32 app not to go through for some users			1
on various @entity3 - oriented message boards , @entity6 7 users were complaining that they 'd send a message which appeared to work fine , only to later see the dreaded red exclamation point that means it was n't actually sent			1
" we are aware of an issue that affects a fraction of a percent of our @entity32 users , and we will have a fix available in an upcoming software update , " @entity3 said in a statement e-mailed to media outlets			1
" in the meantime , we encourage any users having problems to reference our troubleshooting documents or contact @entity53 to help resolve their issue			2
we apologize for any inconvenience this causes impacted users			2
" the fix ? until the update rolls out , some users say they 've been able to get rid of the problem by turning their phone off and back on			2
animation flu some folks say they 're already sick of @entity22			2
@entity66 and @entity67 users , or at least a few of them , say they 're getting symptoms similar to motion sickness while looking at @entity22 animations			1
on the new system , images zoom in and out when users switch between apps			1
as @entity76 explains , the brain gets unsettled when the eyes try to focus on images that do n't match up -- for example , when you 're on a rocking ship or moving car and trying to read a stationary item , like a book			0
the fix ? @entity2 7 users can go to " settings , " then " general " and then " accessibility			2
" click on " @entity90 " to make the zooming go away			0
battery drain this one has been mostly reported by users of older phones like the @entity96			0
simply , they say @entity22 seems to drain their batteries faster than @entity2 did			0
one factor may be that @entity22 expands the ability to run apps in the background while focusing on another task			0
the fix ? again , go to " settings " and " general , " but then choose " @entity107			0
" from there , you can choose which apps you 'll allow to run in the background and which you wo n't			0
there are also general battery - saving steps , like dimming your screen and making sure things like @entity118 and @entity119 are switched off if you 're not using them			0
certain apps log you out this one might take care of itself over time			0
when @entity3 updates its operating system , apps that rely on parts of it ( like @entity128 ) must update as well			1
until they do , they sometimes kick users out			0
on @entity3 message boards , users were mentioning apps like @entity135 and @entity136 as frequent offenders			1
the fix ? some developers may have already tweaked their products , and other fixes are probably on the way			0
but if you 're still having problems , you can go to " settings , " " general " and " @entity107 " again			0
turn off any apps you 're having problems with			0
lock screen bypass this one has already been addressed in an @entity22 update from @entity3 just days after the new operating system rolled out			1
for the first few days , iphones and @entity67 apparently were vulnerable in one particular instance			1
if users were running the @entity128 app and had @entity157 activated on their lock screens , there were a few steps someone could take to unlock their phones			1
but the @entity166 update , released on september 26 , " fixes bugs that could allow someone to bypass the lock screen passcode , " according to @entity3			1
are you encountering issues with @entity22 ? if so , have you found a way to fix them ? let us know in the comments .			0

@entity32 not working for some users of @entity3 's new mobile system
