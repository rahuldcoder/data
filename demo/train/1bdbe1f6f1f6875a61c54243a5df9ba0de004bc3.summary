-- as often as we talk about " getting away from it all , " it 's rare to find a retreat that drops us in another era			2
most accommodations assume guests need soft sheets , @entity9 and a certain predictability to feel at home			2
yet for many travelers , ease and convenience take a backseat to authenticity , and the best place to stay is the one that will startle you out of your everyday life			1
that 's why at some destinations , the absence of electricity and running water are selling points			2
elsewhere , bygone eras are carefully conjured to create a sense of living history			2
8 hotels still fresh at 100 try staying in one of these five spots if you 're looking for a dramatic perspective shift : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 in the @entity39 , timeworn sharecroppers ' shacks once dotted the landscape			1
but as farm workers , both black and white , left the region in search of better jobs , shacks were left derelict and often destroyed			1
enter the @entity34 in @entity35			2
owners @entity46 , @entity47 and a few other locals opened the now 38 - room inn in 1998 in part to preserve an endangered piece of history			1
they were inspired with the idea after one set up his own shack on the former @entity56 , located three miles from the crossroads of @entity58 and 61 , where legend has it blues musician @entity60 sold his soul to the devil for his guitar - playing skills			1
passing tourists from as far away as @entity66 and @entity67 began inquiring about renting the shack			1
" i said , you know , we could have a nice little business here , but we need more shacks , " recalls @entity46 , whose own grandfathers grew up in migrant shacks			2
soon they were transporting shacks from up to 30 miles away , most built between the 1920s and the 1950s			2
as the supply dwindled , @entity46 and @entity47 began buying and " funking up " eco shacks made with structurally insulated panels			2
they also fixed up rooms ( or " bins " ) in the plantation 's one - time cotton gin			1
no one 's pretending a stay at the @entity34 resembles the harsh lives sharecroppers endured			1
bins and shacks come with air conditioning , plumbing and even internet access , but do n't expect sheet thread - count specs and wake - up calls			1
the ethos is rooted instead in " a down - home feel , " says @entity46 , whose target market encompasses blues enthusiasts , artists and those interested in history and the civil rights movement			1
the area 's musical heritage is a key part of the @entity34 experience			2
the inn hosts a harmonica workshop three times a year and recently held its first blues guitar and bass camp			1
such modern - day legends as @entity112 and @entity113 have been known to spend the night			1
@entity34 is open year round			0
rooms vary in style , size and price , but most are $ 65 - $ 80 per night with a two - night minimum stay on weekends			1
you must be 25 years or older to rent a room			1
