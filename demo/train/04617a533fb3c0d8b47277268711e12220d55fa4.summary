@entity0 -- roughly half of all @entity3 now think the @entity4 was behind the @entity6 decision to target conservative political groups , according to a recent @entity1 / @entity9 poll , a growing belief at odds with information recently provided to @entity1 by congressional investigators			1
the information includes a full transcript of the may 21 deposition of @entity16 , a high - ranking @entity6 official placed on administrative leave as a result of her role in the scandal			1
@entity16 was questioned extensively by investigators from the @entity22 , which is chaired by one of the administration 's fiercest congressional critics , @entity27 @entity26 rep. @entity23			1
the transcript of @entity16 's deposition , examined by @entity1 this week , shows an agency plagued more by bureaucratic ineptitude than partisan political scheming			1
@entity6 agents are revealed as politically tone deaf and blind to what was being done , or not done , in different offices that presumably should have been in closer contact			2
" @entity38 was not something they were interested in , " @entity16 told investigators			1
" because they are so apolitical , they are not as sensitive as we would like them to be as to how things might appear			0
" @entity16 is a top official at the @entity6 division responsible for reviewing applications for tax - exempt status			1
some critics argue the division intentionally intimidated and harassed tea party and other conservative groups , often delaying the processing of their applications for months or years			0
an inspector general 's report released last month found that an @entity6 unit in @entity56 had used criteria that included conservative labels such as " tea party " to target certain groups for extra questioning			2
@entity6 rules prevent groups engaged in excessive political activity from becoming tax exempt , but the agency has struggled to develop clear guidelines on the matter			2
the targeting began in 2010 and ended last year when senior @entity6 officials learned of it , according to the report			2
@entity72 : ' who is going to jail ' over @entity6 scandal last month , 37 % of the public thought the @entity4 was tied to the @entity6 controversy			1
now , 47 % say the @entity4 was directing the @entity6 , according to the latest @entity1 / @entity9 survey			2
@entity79 are sensitive to the charge , which some analysts contend has contributed to a recent drop in president @entity84 's approval ratings			0
@entity86 rep. @entity85 , the top @entity87 on @entity23 's panel , released the full transcript on tuesday of the deposition of a self - described " conservative @entity26 " @entity6 manager who has denied any administration involvement in the scandal			1
the manager also insisted that the initial decision to flag tea party groups for additional scrutiny originated with lower level @entity6 staff in @entity56 , not upper management in @entity0 or elsewhere			0
" this interview transcript provides a detailed first - hand account of how these practices first originated , and it debunks conspiracy theories about how the @entity6 first started reviewing these cases , " @entity85 said			1
" releasing this transcript serves the best interest of @entity107 and the @entity3 people by ensuring that there is an accurate and fair picture of the management challenges facing the @entity6			1
" @entity84 : @entity6 actions " intolerable and inexcusable " the move by @entity85 drew a sharp rebuke from @entity23 , who has also released certain elements of the investigation at different points			1
" i am deeply disappointed that ranking member @entity85 has decided to broadly disseminate and post online a 205 page transcript that will serve as a roadmap for @entity6 officials to navigate investigative interviews with @entity107 , " @entity23 said			1
" americans who think @entity107 should investigate @entity6 misconduct should be outraged by mr. @entity85 ' efforts to obstruct needed oversight			1
" @entity23 and @entity85 have both promised in appearances on @entity1 's " @entity127 " to release transcripts of all of the depositions conducted in the investigation			1
for her part , @entity16 told investigators from two @entity4 committees that questions about certain applications often remained unanswered because @entity6 agents were simply " waiting for guidance " from @entity0 that was never provided			1
meanwhile , agency leaders in @entity0 remained unaware that applicants were not receiving final answers			0
@entity16 was under the impression that the " tea party " label was internal @entity6 shorthand for all cases regarding groups involved in campaign politics			2
" it was really just an efficient way to refer to this issue , " @entity16 told investigators , noting that the first case identified with political campaign activity related to an application from a tea party group			2
" it 's like calling soda ' @entity159 ' or you know , tissue ' @entity156			0
' they knew what they meant , and the issue was campaign intervention			0
" applications for tax - exempt status " was an area that did not get a great deal of attention ... outside the @entity6 , " @entity16 added			2
" it 's only been in recent years that it 's something that has gotten , you know , more media attention and congressional attention			0
" many @entity6 employees have been with the agency " for decades " and " were used to a world where how they talked about things internally was not something that would be public or that anyone would be interested in , " @entity16 said			1
" so i do n't think they thought much about how it would appear to others			0
they knew what they meant , and that was sort of good enough for them			0
" @entity16 insisted she never took part in any discussion about targeting conservatives			0
she also noted other cases in recent years involved a denial of tax - exempt status for liberal groups , an assertion challenged by critics			0
" i had no indication that we were not being balanced in what we were doing , " she said			0
@entity16 noted that she was personally involved in a review of roughly 40 cases in the fall of 2010 , an acknowledgment undercutting claims that the @entity56 office was solely to blame for the debacle			0
roughly half of the cases involved groups with the words " tea party " in the name			0
@entity212 and other conservative activists are planning to hold a rally on @entity215 on wednesday to protest the @entity6 actions .			0

deposition of @entity6 official @entity16 shows no political motivation behind @entity6 scandal
@entity16 : " @entity38 was not something they were interested in "
@entity16 's assertion is at odds with belief of growing number of @entity3
reps . @entity23 and @entity85 argue over release of deposition transcripts
