it was supposed to be the end of an era , the end of a generation			0
had it not been for a post , then perhaps the world would be looking at a different future			0
football is nothing but fickle			0
the headline will be @entity1 's 4 - 0 annihilation of @entity15 , swatting aside the critics and doubters in the only way that this great team know how			1
had the ball deflected off the post and spun the other way , the chilling inquest into @entity1 's fall of grace would have already begun			1
the biggest of games , the smallest of margins			0
trailing 2 - 0 from the first leg , @entity1 was in a supposed crisis , its crown as @entity33 's dominant force precariously balanced			1
@entity34 defeats to arch rival @entity35 in domestic competition and the anemic display at @entity38 just three weeks ago had stoked the fires			0
but on this occasion , it was not just at the @entity42 where black smoke rose across @entity45 skies , but also in @entity15 , as its @entity47 dream went up in flames			1
it could have been a different story -- but history is written by the victors and @entity1 were victorious by a considerable distance			1
without coach @entity54 , who is still undergoing cancer treatment , question marks had emerged about the ability of the club to make it through to its sixth consecutive quarterfinal			0
and perhaps , but for a post and a roll of the ball , those questions would have been answered quite differently			0
maybe the opportunity fell to the wrong man			0
at just 18 , @entity66 cut an unlikely cast member for the role of hero			0
without a goal to his name since his move to @entity15 at the end of last season , it was he who was given the golden opportunity to bring @entity1 to its knees with just seven minutes of the opening period remaining			1
already trailing to @entity81 's fifth minute strike , @entity66 took advantage of an error by @entity84 before gliding towards goal			1
this was the moment that @entity15 had waited for and while @entity66 hit his effort hard and true , it crashed against the post and away to safety			1
an away goal then would have given even @entity1 a mountain to climb with a minimum of four goals needed to progress			1
whether @entity1 's world would have crumbled had that ball nestled in the far corner will never be known , but had it done so , then @entity15 would have at least given itself a chance			1
that @entity1 recorded four anyway will not help @entity66 sleep any better			1
there is little room for " what if ? " in sport however and @entity1 left little to chance as it went on to produce a mesmeric performance			2
only last week , a @entity107 jeweler created a 25 kilogram solid $ 5.25 million gold statue of @entity81 's left foot , although the price may well rise following his latest exploits			2
his early strike , a sumptuous effort following a delightful pass from @entity115 , was his 57th in the @entity47 , placing him second behind @entity116 in the all - time top scorers of @entity33 's elite competition			2
his 58th came less than 100 seconds after @entity66 had threatened to send shockwaves throughout @entity33			0
this time , albeit with a suspicion of offside , @entity81 unleashed an unstoppable drive from 20 - yards after @entity124 had gift wrapped possession to the @entity1 man			1
the halftime whistle brought some solace for @entity15 , but it only delayed the inevitable			2
if there were any statisticians in the @entity15 dressing room then they may have known that @entity1 had won both of its previous games during a papal conclave			1
but not even a prayer was going to help the @entity45 side out of this			2
just 10 minutes of the second period had elapsed when @entity142 's dreadful error allowed @entity115 's pass to skip into the path of @entity145 , who curled an exquisite effort into the far corner			2
@entity15 threatened sporadically and a wonderful block from @entity149 denied @entity150 as @entity1 began to look nervous for the first time in the contest			1
but @entity153 soon laid any worries to rest , racing onto @entity157 's pass deep into stoppage time before slotting the ball past @entity160			0
for @entity162 , the result was a relief			0
" if there was anyone not sure about @entity81 then this was the perfect response as he took charge of the game with two goals and showed again that he is an extraordinary player , out of this world , " he told reporters			2
" before we were n't so poor and now we are not so great and i would n't describe ourselves as favorites for the competition			0
" at any stage of the game until the final goal we could have gone out if we had conceded and i would have said the same that we played well and were composed			0
" crisis ? what crisis			0
@entity181 provided by @entity182 in the night 's other game , @entity183 booked its place in the last eight with a dramatic 3 - 2 win over @entity182 in @entity188 to progress 4 - 3 on aggregate			1
following a 1 - 1 draw in the first leg , @entity182 looked set to progress when @entity192 prodded home from close - range			1
but @entity183 , boasting the likes of @entity196 and @entity197 , was soon level thanks to a stunning 25 - yard drive from former @entity182 player @entity200			1
@entity201 then grabbed his eighth goal of the competition to put @entity183 ahead and put himself top of the @entity47 goalscoring charts			2
@entity206 smashed an effort against the crossbar with 63 minutes gone before @entity209 leveled soon after			0
but with @entity182 pushing up for a winner , @entity210 raced through to score and seal his side 's place in the quarterfinals for the first time in 12 years			1
" we showed we deserve to be in the quarter - finals , but it was a close game and both teams had their chances , " said @entity200			2
" perhaps we had a bit of luck at the end , but i 'll take that			0
" we responded well to fight back after conceding the early goal			0

@entity1 crushed @entity15 4 - 0 to progress 4 - 2 on aggregate
@entity81 scored twice with @entity145 and @entity149 also on target
@entity183 claimed a 3 - 2 win at @entity188 side @entity182
@entity234 team through to quarterfinals 4 - 3 on aggregate
