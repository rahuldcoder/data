@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 announced friday it will deny the @entity5 's petition asking it to prohibit the use of bisphenol a , commonly known as @entity8 , in products manufactured in the @entity10			1
however , the federal agency stressed the announcement is not a final safety determination and it continues to support research examining the safety of @entity8			1
in 2008 , the council submitted a petition asking the @entity3 to regulate the use of @entity8 in human food and food packaging			2
the @entity3 had been silent since the petition was filed more than 41 months ago			0
the council finally , last december , sued the administration to get some form of action			0
friday 's announcement is a response to that suit			0
@entity8 is a chemical used in many consumer products , including clear and hard plastics called polycarbonate used in water and soda bottles , as well as in the resin linings of food and beverage cans and containers of infant formula			1
the @entity39 responded by saying it believes the @entity3 " made the wrong call			0
" " bpa is a toxic chemical that has no place in our food supply , " said a statement from dr. @entity42 , a senior scientist in the council 's public health program			0
" the agency has failed to protect our health and safety in the face of scientific studies that continue to raise disturbing questions about the long - term effects of @entity8 exposures , especially in fetuses , babies and young children , " the statement said			1
" the @entity3 is out of step with scientific and medical research			0
this illustrates the need for a major overhaul of how the government protects us against dangerous chemicals			0
" the @entity39 says the @entity3 's approval of @entity8 for use in packaging food " results in human exposure " to the chemical and is " dangerous to those who use the products			1
" it says studies have linked @entity8 exposure to a number of dangerous side effects , including defects in newborns , harm to the central nervous system , increased rates of prostate and breast cancer , and metabolic changes in the body that lead to obesity and insulin resistance , which are the main causes of diabetes			2
in a separate news release , the council noted a group of 38 scientific experts recently published a statement saying the evidence of adverse effects of low doses of @entity8 from laboratory experiments on mice " is a great cause for concern with regard to the potential for similar adverse effects in humans			2
" the @entity3 , which has been getting pressure regarding bpa exposure from other food safety groups as well the @entity39 , is working to remove the chemical from baby bottles and sippy cups , steps already taken by some states , such as @entity116			1
many food manufacturers have removed or are considering removing @entity8 from their packaging			0
@entity119 recently announced it would be taking @entity8 out of its cans			0
also , a growing body of research looking at subtle effects of low levels of @entity8 exposure has led the @entity126 at the @entity127 and the @entity3 to announce it has " some concern " about the potential effects of @entity8 " on the brain , behavior , and prostate gland in fetuses , infants and young children			2
" however , in the @entity3 announcement friday the agency noted that , in response to the petition , while evidence from some studies have raised questions as to whether @entity8 may be associated with a variety of health effects , there remain serious questions about these studies , particularly as they relate to humans and the public health impact of @entity8			1
the agency also stressed that it " has been studying and continues to study the effects of bpa and will make any necessary changes to @entity8 's status based on the science			1
" it said the agency " is working toward completion of another updated safety review on @entity8 this year to include all relevant studies and publications			2

the @entity3 says the decision does not represent a final safety determination
the @entity5 pressed the agency to respond to its request for a *ban*
the agency says there are serious questions about studies showing @entity8 's effects
@entity8 is a chemical used in bottles , cans and other containers
