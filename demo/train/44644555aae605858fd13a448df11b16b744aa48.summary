@entity0 , @entity1 -- at dawn , two women rise after sleeping on mats outside an @entity1 hospital			1
they 've waited all night for a chance to see their newborn babies , whom the hospital is holding until the medical bills are paid in full			2
" holding babies until payment is common in @entity1 , " said @entity12 , a midwife who founded birthing clinics in @entity14 and the island of @entity0			1
at this particular hospital in @entity0 , mothers who do n't pay are allowed in twice a day to feed their baby and change their baby 's diaper			1
those fortunate enough to find the money may take their babies home			2
others might relinquish their parental rights and place their babies up for adoption , @entity12 explained			1
" you worry , ' will i be able to deliver this baby safely into the world ? ' but you should n't have to worry , ' how will i pay for it ? ' " said @entity12 , 54			1
" @entity37 , " or " @entity38 " as she is called by the locals , is working to change that with her @entity35 ( @entity34 ) health clinics			2
these birthing sanctuaries offer free prenatal care , birthing services and medical aid to anyone who needs it			1
and the needs are vast in @entity1			1
the average family earns the equivalent of $ 8 a day , according to the @entity50 , but a normal hospital delivery without complications costs around $ 70			2
a caesarian section can cost more than $ 700			0
@entity12 believes @entity1 's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs , which many women can not meet			1
in turn , their lives and the lives of their babies are at risk			0
according to the @entity67 , three out of five women giving birth in @entity66 do so without a skilled birth attendant on hand			2
" the situation is bad ... babies are unattended , deliveries have become commercialized , and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they ca n't afford proper care , " @entity12 said			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity80 working as a midwife in @entity1 was not something @entity12 , a @entity83 citizen and author of many books related to infant and maternal health , planned for her life			1
but after several personal tragedies , her life shifted in a new direction			0
" in the span of a year , i lost my best friend and one of the midwives who delivered my child , " said @entity12 , who has eight children			1
" my sister also died as a complication of her third pregnancy , and so did her baby			2
i was crushed , just crushed			0
" but i decided not to get angry			0
i decided to become part of the solution			0
if i could help even one family prevent the loss of a mother or a child , i would do that			0
i would dedicate my life to it			0
" @entity12 and her husband , @entity111 , sold their home in @entity115 and moved the family to @entity0 to " reinvent their lives			1
" for @entity12 , there was no second - guessing the destination			1
raised in the @entity122 while her father was stationed in @entity1 with the @entity83 military , she says she " always felt happiest in @entity66			1
" once in @entity0 , @entity12 volunteered to help local midwives deliver babies in various homes			1
and as the demand for her services grew , she decided to receive formal midwife certification			0
in 2003 , with help from the @entity134 community and donations from friends across the globe , @entity12 and her husband opened the first @entity35 clinic			1
at the clinic , there are midwives , nurses , housekeepers , a doctor and a chef			0
a short time later , after the massive tsunami in 2004 , a smaller , sister location was built in @entity14 to care for displaced survivors			2
combined , the two clinics have facilitated the birth of more than 5,000 babies			2
some @entity1 celebrities and expatriates choose @entity35 to birth their children , and they often give donations			1
but @entity12 says 80 % of the families served by the clinics can barely pay anything			1
" @entity161 or prostitute , everyone gets treated ( like a ) vip at @entity35 ... with kindness and respect , " she said			0
" it 's something to see a family come year after year , every time their mango tree gives fruit , and give a few mangoes to the staff to say thank you			0
" no one gets rich being a midwife			0
the riches that you experience are the deeper values			0
" part of these riches , @entity12 said , is the knowledge that so many people rely on the clinics , two of the few 24 - hour businesses in @entity14 and @entity0			1
" everyone knows us , " she said			0
" for expecting couples who do n't have a phone to call us for help or for a ride , it 's common for them to hop on their motorcycles in the night to get to the clinic , where they know someone will be there waiting			2
and if they have a special request for me , i 'll get a call , i 'll get up and i 'll go do the delivery			2
" the love and attention is appreciated by the new mothers , who do n't have alternatives for safe , accessible care			1
" i had my first born ... in a different clinic , " said gusti " @entity210 " ketut @entity207 , a 31 - year - old who came to @entity12 for the birth of her second child in february			1
" there 's a big difference between that experience and ( @entity35 )			0
here , i feel comfortable			0
@entity38 is very kind , very motherly			0
" i do not have money , and i tell my friends to also come here			0
i wish there were more people like her to lift up the suffering of the poor people			0
" @entity12 hopes that @entity207 's experience can become the standard practice worldwide			1
" does the world have a responsibility to all pregnant women , to each new baby ? yes , " @entity12 said			1
" each baby , each adult deserves a clean , healthy , loving environment			2
... those things are basic			0
those are a human right			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity235 website at @entity236 and see how to help			0
@entity2 's @entity237 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 opened free birthing clinics in @entity1 , where many families ca n't afford care
hospitals there will often hold newborns until the mothers can pay for the delivery
@entity12 : the world has a responsibility to all pregnant women and each new baby
