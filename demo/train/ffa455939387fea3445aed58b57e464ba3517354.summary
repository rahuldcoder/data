@entity0 , @entity1 -- last weekend , another large piece of " space junk " tumbled to @entity5 , perhaps in @entity6			1
many people -- if they noted the event at all -- probably worried about being hit on the head , even though the odds are overwhelmingly against such a catastrophe ( trillions to one )			0
but for thousands of astrophysicists around the world , the @entity15 @entity14 satellite ( " rosat " ) was no mere rubbish ; it was an old and important friend			2
launched in 1990 , a few months after the better known @entity21 , @entity16 provided images of the sky in @entity24 ( very short wavelength light ) , as opposed to the red - green - blue light visible with @entity21 , meaning it could see the most energetic phenomena in the @entity28			1
@entity16 had better image quality than any x-ray satellite had before , an improvement comparable to the superiority of @entity21 imaging compared to ground - based telescopes			1
a few thousand astronomers worldwide used @entity16 to study the universe , discovering where black holes are growing , when massive clusters of galaxies formed , and how neutron stars and black holes in our @entity42 behave			1
i used @entity16 to study the wildly varying emission from " jets " of energetic particles emanating from the central black holes in distant galaxies			1
these particles are far more energetic than those produced in man - made terrestrial accelerators like the @entity53			0
others made exquisite images of the remnants of stellar explosions ( " supernova remnants " like @entity59 ) or mapped the hot gases held by gravity in the space between dense clusters of galaxies or indeed to image the entire sky			1
one totally unexpected discovery was that comets -- cold balls of ice heated by the @entity70 as they whiz past -- are strong x-ray emitters , thanks to the interaction of energetic particles from the @entity70 with the gaseous material around the comet			0
the same physics explains x-ray light seen from the dark side of the moon , which otherwise shadows the bright all sky x-ray glow from growing black holes			2
dr. @entity84 , the recently appointed @entity85 in @entity86 , began his career working on the @entity16 project			2
his planning kept the satellite working long after two gyros failed early in the mission , and he developed as a scientist using @entity16 to make very deep pictures of the x-ray sky , so he found the satellite 's demise an especially poignant moment			1
" we recently moved to @entity86 from @entity15 , " he said , " and while unpacking the family 's shipping container " he found his miniature @entity16 model			1
it now sits on his desk at the institute , next to a piece of the spare detector housing			0
" i definitely felt an emotional attachment to this project , " he admitted			0
astrophysicists in the @entity111 and beyond made excellent use of @entity16 's capabilities , finding some 110,000 new x-ray sources ( galaxies , stars , comets , etc. ) and making x-ray observations an integral part of every astronomer 's toolkit			1
the project had spinoff value as well : techniques used to manufacture @entity16 's mirror surfaces were later applied to making ordinary optical lenses			2
your bifocals might have been made using @entity16 technology			0
it may be " space junk " to some , but its benefits are riding on a lot of noses			1
twenty years ago , experts in @entity15 , the @entity111 and the @entity137 collaborated to build and launch the @entity16 satellite			1
these days , international collaboration in x-ray astronomy has become the norm , with the @entity143 and @entity144 space agencies as major partners with @entity146			0
transcending political boundaries , decisions about what a satellite observes are based on scientific merit , not national origin			0
@entity146 scientist dr. @entity153 ( no relation to the @entity156 character ) helped decide the annual program of @entity16 observations			0
each year , scientists would submit hundreds of proposals outlining their plans for the telescope , which were then ranked competitively			0
only a small fraction were approved			0
for every scientist granted precious @entity16 observing time , the re-entry last weekend had to sting			2
dr. @entity153 was definitely chagrined to hear @entity16 referred to as " space junk " in news stories			1
" that was really depressing , " he said , " when it was such a huge scientific success			0
" but he was n't worried about falling debris landing on inhabited places , even though , like the @entity177 satellite a few weeks earlier , big pieces of @entity16 ( the glass mirrors ) were expected to hit the ground before burning up completely			2
most of the @entity5 's surface is covered by oceans and most of @entity5 's land masses are unoccupied , so the odds of falling space debris causing damage are miniscule -- which is why space agencies do not go to the expense of planning controlled re-entries			0
dr. @entity84 estimates that space debris as large as @entity16 falls to @entity5 every few weeks , almost all of it unreported and unnoticed			1
last weekend , somewhere on @entity5 , the @entity16 re-entry must have made beautiful " shooting stars " streaking across the sky			1
but the fact that there are no eyewitness reports underscores the fact that most of the planet -- especially our oceans -- is uninhabited			0
so the @entity16 fall from the heavens may not have been witnessed , but the satellite certainly is remembered			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0

last weekend a large piece of " space junk " tumbled to earth
@entity210 , an astronomer , says it was the remains of a valuable *research* satellite
the satellite 's x-ray images of the sky enabled views of high - energy phenomena
