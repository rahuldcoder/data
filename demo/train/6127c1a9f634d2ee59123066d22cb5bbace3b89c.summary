@entity0 , @entity1 -- i sat on my friend 's couch trying my best not to laugh			1
he was an associate pastor of the church i was attending , and he had taken it upon himself to introduce me to the ex-gay movement			2
i was in the early stages of coming out , and let 's just say he was n't very happy for me			1
on this particular night , my friend and spiritual adviser decided to show me a video featuring the keynote speaker at an ex-gay conference in one final attempt to " save my soul			0
" @entity21 accomplished -- just not in the way he had hoped			0
that 's because when the guy on the tape opened his mouth , i thought @entity28 from " @entity29 " had taken the stage			1
now normally , i 'm not one who generally buys into stereotypes , but when he said he could n't wait to get home to make love to his wife , i had a difficult time keeping a straight face			0
it was then i knew it was better for me to join my brethren outside of the closet than soullessly antagonize them from inside , like the dude on tv			0
seems like there 's always a dude on tv , does n't it ? you know , the anti-gay activist who is secretly involved in an apparent pro-gay activity ? last week , it was discovered a former board member of the @entity54 , @entity53 , recently hired a gay male escort to carry his luggage around @entity57			1
the escort says @entity53 wanted him to give him erotic massages			1
( @entity53 denies he is gay )			1
but @entity53 ' story is very similar to that of pastor @entity63 , whose story was like sen. @entity65 's , whose story was like gov. @entity67 's , whose story was like ... well , you get the picture			1
it 's as if being anti-gay is the new coming out			1
when i was younger , i used to jokingly dismiss the salacious " gotcha " moments @entity53 , who recently resigned from the board of the @entity76 , now finds himself in			1
but when you consider the political , judicial and economic influence that he and those of his ilk have , and how they use that influence to selfishly impede social progress , derail justice and vilify an entire group of people , you understand why @entity89 named his documentary chronicling the double lives of folks like @entity63 and @entity93			0
" when you really think about it , anger -- not laughter -- should be the reaction			0
in the black community , one of the worst things another black person can call you is an @entity103			1
based on the 1852 novel " @entity112 , " the name is given to black people who consciously turn their back on or undermine their own community in an attempt to appease and gain acceptance from the white community			1
one of my favorite rap groups , @entity114 , summed it up on their 1991 song " @entity119 " this way : " @entity120 ' the race / blowin ' up the whole @entity122 ' some of them lookin ' / just like you			0
" the gay and lesbian community has plenty of @entity127 trying to blow us up from inside , but what we do n't have is our own word or phrase to identify them			1
some call them " closet cases , " but there is a difference between someone who is unwilling to live openly and honestly , and someone who takes that a step further and hurts those who do			2
people in the closet warrant a level of sympathy because we all know how difficult it can be to embrace one 's truth			2
and i do not believe in outing people who are simply living in hiding			0
but i do believe in revealing the identities of these gay @entity127			2
people like @entity53 , a @entity152 minister who was paid to testify against gay adoption and travel the globe preaching that therapy can " cure " gay people , do not deserve the same sympathy given to those who are afraid of losing their jobs			1
not when they consciously morph from being victims of homophobia to attack dogs eating their young			0
some of my @entity165 friends suggested calling folks like @entity53 and @entity167 , " a play on infamous 1970s anti-gay figurehead @entity169			1
but she was never accused of soliciting sex from a same - sex police officer in an airport bathroom like sen. @entity175 was			0
a few on @entity177 thought " @entity178 " could work			0
@entity179 was a prominent lawyer who joined sen. @entity180 in targeting gays during the @entity183 scare of the 1950s			0
despite being gay himself , he continued to oppose gay rights until his aids - related death in 1986			2
that 's a good option , but the truth is , i really do not like linking this viral form of self - hate to warm and fuzzy names like " @entity167 " and " @entity178			2
" i do n't want to call them anything that appears cute and harmless , because they are not			2
and they are more than just late - night punch lines			0
they are extremely dangerous individuals who are instrumental in the manipulation of religion , the legislating of discrimination and the overturning of equality			0
sorry if i do n't sound very forgiving , but i 've never been big on coddling those who wish to use my neck as a stepladder			0
i prefer to see them as they are : the enemy within			2
i hope we all stop laughing at ( and covering for ) them -- and start calling them all out for what they truly are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 : there 's a long list of anti-gay activists caught involved in pro-gay activity
@entity54 's @entity53 hired a gay male escort for @entity57 trip
@entity219 : blacks call someone who undermines their own community an " @entity103 "
@entity234 community needs a name for similar *hypocrites* , he says ; they are the enemy within
