@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 has reached back 13.2 billion years -- farther than ever before in time and space -- to reveal a " primordial population " of galaxies never seen before			1
" the deeper @entity2 looks into space , the farther back in time it looks , because light takes billions of years to cross the observable universe , " the @entity8 said in a statement released tuesday			1
" this makes @entity2 a powerful ' time machine ' that allows astronomers to see galaxies as they were 13 billion years ago -- just 600 million to 800 million years after the @entity20 , " the institute said in a statement released tuesday			1
the existence of these newly found galaxies pushes back the time when galaxies began to form to before 500 - 600 million years after the @entity20 , the institute said			1
" these galaxies could have roots stretching into an earlier population of stars			1
there must be a substantial component of galaxies beyond @entity2 's detection limit , " according to @entity34 of the @entity35 in @entity36 , who was quoted in the release			1
members of the @entity40 are meeting this week in @entity0 to review the data and images retrieved by @entity2 's new infrared @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , which was installed in may , institute spokesman @entity38 told @entity1			2
some of the images were shared with the public in september			0
the camera , @entity38 said , is far superior to the previous camera , which could only see galaxies about 900 million years after the @entity20 -- the cosmic explosion that is theorized to mark the origin of the universe			2
but it is reaching its limits , he said			2
a more powerful instrument , the @entity54 , is planned for launch in 2014			2
it will allow astronomers to study the detailed nature of early galaxies and discover many more even farther away			2
from the current cache of images , astronomers can see for the first time that " galaxies grew from small , bright clusters of stars to the big spiral cities of stars today , " @entity38 said			1
the small galaxies show up as ultra-blue in color			1
he likened the @entity2 results to " looking through a scrapbook of baby pictures			0
" according to the institute , " the deep observations also demonstrate the progressive buildup of galaxies and provide further support for the hierarchical model of galaxy assembly , where small objects ... merge to form bigger objects over a smooth and steady but dramatic process of collision and agglomeration			0
it 's like streams merging into tributaries and then into a bay			0
" the camera was pointed at a section of sky known as the @entity93 , which was initially surveyed in visible light in 2004 , and showed a dark sky filled with more than 10,000 galaxies			0
the @entity43 instrument repeated the exercise in august for infrared light			0
some mosaics were formed with the images from both surveys			0
according to @entity38 , the archive from @entity2 contains more than 500,000 pictures that can be accessed by the world 's 6,000 astronomers			0
the data from the @entity93 have been analyzed by at least five international teams of astronomers , he said .			0

findings show galaxies grew from small , bright clusters of stars to big spirals of today
@entity2 functions as a type of time machine , looking at early formation of universe
@entity2 reaching its limits ; more powerful *telescope* to be launched in 2014 .
