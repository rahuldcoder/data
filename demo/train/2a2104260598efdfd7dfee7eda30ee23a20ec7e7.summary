-- a " sleeping " @entity1 woke up in time to beat @entity2 at the @entity3 and keep alive her chances of reaching a fourth consecutive hard - court grand slam final			1
@entity1 dropped the first set against the former world no. 1 and struggled to put the @entity8 away but eventually prevailed 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 in a hard - hitting fourth - round encounter that was pushed back to tuesday because of rain			1
it was the second straight match the world @entity12 -- she , too , is a former no. 1 -- needed to stage a comeback following a sluggish start			2
@entity18 's @entity17 won their tiebreak in the first set in the third round			1
men 's no. 1 @entity23 had no such troubles , routing @entity27 @entity26 in about one hour , 20 minutes			2
@entity1 struck a mere four winners in the first set against @entity2 , combined with nine unforced errors			1
@entity2 certainly was n't asleep , crushing 17 winners			2
" @entity34 came out firing and played amazing in the first set , and i felt like i was a little out of place , " @entity1 said in an interview on court			2
" i was sleeping but she was ripping winners and serving great so i really had to wake up in the second set and fight for the points			0
" in the second set i was more determined , more focused and taking the opportunities			0
" her numbers were n't that much better in the second set but @entity2 cooled thanks in part to @entity1 changing the pace at times with a drop shot			1
in a seesaw third set -- there were four straight breaks at one stage -- @entity1 blew two match points serving at 5 - 3 only to be let off the hook when @entity2 dumped a backhand on a fourth match point			1
although @entity2 put up a brave fight , she ultimately slumped to 3 - 20 against top - two opposition			2
" the match points were pretty bad , " @entity1 , who lost last year 's final to @entity60 , said			1
" i did n't really go for my shots			0
i kept waiting for a mistake			0
" she played really great			0
especially in the tough moments i felt she was raising her game			0
i had to stay tough as well			0
" @entity1 meets pal @entity68 in the quarterfinals having captured two of their four previous encounters			1
three of the matches have gone the distance			0
former @entity76 winner @entity75 of @entity77 achieved a first @entity3 semifinal by overcoming tricky @entity80 @entity79 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 2 and there was more drama in the men 's fourth round as @entity80 's @entity85 outlasted fellow veteran @entity86 of @entity87			1
@entity85 , previously a semifinalist in @entity89 , upended the 2001 champion 6 - 3 3 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 4 7 - 5 in four hours			2
having blown a 5 - 2 lead in the fourth , @entity86 broke @entity85 to get back on serve in the fifth			0
@entity85 subsequently broke at 5 - 5 and served out the match			0
@entity85 next confronts @entity23 , a 6 - 3 6 - 0 6 - 0 winner over a seemingly weakened @entity26			0
