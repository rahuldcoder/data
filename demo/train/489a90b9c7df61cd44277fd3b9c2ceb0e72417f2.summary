-- it took five tries and almost 15 years , but there is no question that @entity6 's successful launch of a satellite into orbit on december 11 is a major technological achievement			1
it is not , however , a serious military threat to the @entity12 or other nations			1
@entity6 still has a long way to go before they can turn the orbiting of a baby satellite , reportedly tumbling out of control , into the ability to threaten others at long distance with a nuclear weapon			1
if the past is any guide , @entity6 's launch of an @entity25 rocket will have international security repercussions far out of proportion to its military capability			1
@entity6 's first attempt in launching a satellite in april 1998 under @entity33 failed , but it triggered a panic in the @entity35 of elaborate anti-missile weapons seized on the launch as proof that dictators of small , undeterrable countries could soon attack the @entity12 with nuclear - armed intercontinental ballistic missiles			1
read more : why did @entity6 launch a rocket ? at the time , a commission chaired by @entity44 made headlines with its warning that " a nation with a well - developed , scud - based ballistic missile infrastructure would be able to achieve first flight of a long - range missile , up to and including intercontinental ballistic missile range ( greater than 5,500 kilometers ) , within about five years of deciding to do so			1
" @entity6 and @entity52 had @entity54 - based missile infrastructures : they were clearly trying to do so			1
fifteen years later , they have not come close to succeeding			0
but the warning achieved its purpose : missile defense programs and budgets soared and have never come down			0
our nation today spends about $ 10 billion a year on such programs , even though the threat never developed as predicted			0
we can expect similar warnings now that @entity66 has done what his father never could			0
and this is the really tragic news			0
success raises stakes for @entity12 missile defense system governments meeting in emergency session in @entity75 and @entity76 will have to produce more than statements of condemnation			1
they will likely support more anti-missile programs			0
the @entity12 , feeling the pressure from them and from defense hawks at home , may increase efforts to field more of the systems it is developing			1
we deploy about 30 ground - based interceptors in silos in @entity91 and @entity92			0
these systems have some ability to hit a long - range rocket , like the @entity25 should it be turned into a missile and aimed at the @entity12 some in @entity97 will no doubt demand that we deploy more			2
we are fielding interceptors at sea aboard @entity102 - class destroyers and cruisers that have some capability against short - range missiles , with plans to grow the program to longer - range missiles and deploy them in @entity110			0
the @entity111 just recently approved arms sales to @entity113 to help that nation upgrade its @entity102 anti-missile system			0
pressures will mount to deploy more capable anti-missile systems in @entity118			0
read more : @entity6 silences doubters , raises fears with rocket launch @entity122 and @entity123 will almost certainly react to these deployments , believing that they are aimed at them , not @entity6 or @entity52			1
this will chill efforts to negotiate reductions in @entity131 stockpiles of nuclear weapons			0
how can we reduce , they will ask , if the @entity12 is racing to ring us with new weapons ? there is no reason for this cycle of action and reaction			2
there is no threat that warrants the panicked deployment of untested and unreliable anti-missile weapons			0
as my colleague and @entity6 expert @entity145 notes , " a successful launch was only a matter of time , and it shows a level of technical sophistication that was always there			1
we need to take @entity6 seriously but not make it more than it really is			2
" i pointed out in 2009 , after @entity6 's third failed attempt , that the nation was a long way from having a nuclear - armed icbm			1
that is still true after this successful launch			1
@entity6 would have to achieve three additional breakthroughs			2
first , it would have to demonstrate the reliability of its launcher			0
the first four tests failed			0
will the next ? sometimes , you really do have to be a rocket scientist to answer questions like this			0
the one i consult is @entity172 of the @entity173			0
he writes , " from past launches , we knew that @entity6 has been able to build or buy working components for a rocket			2
the main difficulty is getting all the parts to work together and at the same time , given the enormous complexity of rockets			0
even with this success , @entity6 has no confidence in the reliability of the rocket , which undermines its utility for military purposes			1
" second , it will have to develop a nuclear warhead small enough and reliable enough to fit on a missile			0
@entity6 ( unlike @entity52 ) has twice tested nuclear devices , but these are believed to be too large and heavy for use in a warhead			2
@entity6 would need several more nuclear tests to achieve this capability			2
read more : @entity122 's reaction third , as @entity6 's long history demonstrates , it is very hard to get something up into space -- and it is just as hard to bring it safely down			1
@entity6 will have to develop and test a re-entry vehicle that can survive the temperatures , pressures and vibration of coming back into the @entity205 's atmosphere and the accuracy to land where targeted			1
it is a long journey from initial satellite launch to an icbm			2
@entity52 first launched a low - @entity205 orbit - satellite in 2009 , the same feat @entity6 has now duplicated , but @entity52 does not now , nor is it likely to have anytime soon , an icbm			1
a new study from the @entity216 concludes that contrary to predictions in the late 1990s that @entity52 or @entity6 or both would have icbms by 2015 , " it is increasingly uncertain whether @entity52 will be able to achieve an icbm capability by 2015			2
" so , the lessons are : do n't underestimate @entity6			1
do n't count on this regime disappearing anytime soon			2
do n't start an arms race that undermines your greater strategic stability goals			1
we need to take a deep breath and work with our allies to get @entity6 back to the bargaining table and off the test ranges			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			0

@entity234 : @entity6 's successful launch of a satellite is a major feat
@entity234 says it is not a serious military threat to the @entity12 or other nations
he says launch will have *disproportionate* international security repercussions
@entity234 : do n't underestimate the regime , but do n't panic and start an arms race
