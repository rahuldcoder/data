the naked celebrities seem to be everywhere lately			1
last week , hackers allegedly stole nude photos from actress @entity3 and then plastered them all over the @entity4			1
before then it was the rapper @entity5 , who wrote on her blog that her @entity9 account was hacked in august when naked photos of her showed up there			1
in march , @entity12 of " @entity13 " underwent a similar ordeal after photos were reportedly stolen from her @entity17 account			2
finally , in december , police in @entity19 alleged two young men had used computer - hacking skills to get access to the e-mail accounts and photos of more than 50 celebrities , according to @entity27 's @entity26 , including the likes of @entity29 and ke $ ha			1
in the wake of all this juicy @entity34 hoopla , people have started to assume these photo leaks are the newest front in the so - called " hacktivist " wars , as waged by big - name hacking rings such as @entity40 and @entity41			1
those groups have claimed responsibility for taking down bank and government websites			2
but security experts said connections between celeb hacks and groups such as @entity40 are thin or nonexistent			1
such groups " would feel this kind of thing is beneath them , " said @entity50 , a senior technology consultant at @entity51 , a computer security company			1
" it 's obviously to gain media exposure , right ? " said @entity58 , a hacker turned security consultant and author of " @entity62			2
" " it 's like everyone is trying to one - up @entity40 and one - up @entity41			1
so somehow celebrities are becoming a target			2
" the celebrity hacks are n't sophisticated , he said			2
he added : " it 's not surprising to me			2
it 's , like , old news			2
" the first real case of a celebrity attack was in 2005 when hackers logged into @entity75 's phone and stole photos of her , said @entity77 , chief research officer at @entity78 , another computer security company			1
those hackers reportedly were able to break into @entity81 's phone by correctly guessing the not - so - secret answer to her security question , which was " tinkerbell , " the name of her pet @entity86			1
the real issue here , the researchers said , is the prevalence , and accessibility of , nude photos			2
if celebrities did n't take and store nude photos of themselves on their phones or on computers , they would n't be stolen and published online			1
" everyone has a camera on them all the time , so the tendency to send something kinky to that hot guy you 're trying to date might be too great , " said @entity50 , who , coincidentally enough , writes a blog called " @entity98 " for @entity51			0
his advice : " if you see someone pointing a camera at you and you 're not wearing any clothes , go and hide behind the wardrobe			0
" who is behind the recent string of stolen celebrity photos -- and how exactly they got them -- remains unclear			1
the @entity118 office in @entity119 has opened an investigation into the incidents of computer hacking but declined to elaborate on the cases involved			2
some people have pointed to a supposedly new hacker ring called @entity126 , which operates a @entity9 feed to discuss these sorts of incidents			0
on monday , the group wrote that it did n't have anything to do with the @entity3 photos : " we did not leak the @entity134 , we would have released it here first ! so stop the speculating ! " the group wrote			1
" i do n't think there 's a clear link " between the celebrity hacks and hacking groups such as @entity40 and @entity41 , said @entity77 , " but obviously these groups are amoebas , and they change shape and they 're so different from each other			1
" their motives are also unclear			1
as a teenager , @entity58 said he used to make a game out of hunting down celebrity phone numbers and then calling them			0
( he remembers saying this to @entity152 , whose number he found : " hey , @entity154 , oh hi			0
i just wanted to let you know i 'm a really big fan of your show			0
i wo n't call you again -- do n't worry			0
" and then he hung up )			0
he sees the celebrity photo stealing as an extension of this sort of pranksterism			0
the hackers are likely out for money , said @entity50 , since these photos could be sold to tabloid or adult websites			1
or celebs could be leaking the photos to get attention			0
" i think we have to consider that as a possibility , " he said			0
flip that argument around , and you 'll notice hackers have become a popular scapegoat for celebrities and politicians who spill information by accident			1
remember former @entity185 rep. @entity184 ? when nude photos of the @entity189 congressman surfaced on @entity9 , " he initially blamed a hacker , " @entity50 said			0
" it was n't so much the picture of him in his pants that did him in			0
it was more the cover - up			0
" @entity184 later admitted to sending the photos himself and resigned			0
if one thing 's clear , it 's that this kind of celebrity hack is n't going away soon			1
" it 's going to escalate , " @entity77 said			0
" after people saw what happened to @entity3 , you can damn well bet there are people out there who are trying to do the same thing to other pretty actresses			0
" well , at least until the pretty actresses stop taking nude photos .			0

hackers have been stealing and posting photos of naked celebrities
it 's unclear who is behind the attacks and what their motives are
experts say these attacks are " beneath " big - name hacking groups such as @entity40
the attacks are n't especially new , but they appear to be escalating
