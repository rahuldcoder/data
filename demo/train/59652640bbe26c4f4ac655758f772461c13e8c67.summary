@entity0 remains unconscious in a @entity3 hospital following his horrific crash at october 's @entity6 @entity5 , but the @entity8 driver has begun a program of rehabilitation therapy , according to a statement released by his family on tuesday			1
@entity0 , who suffered a head injury while driving for the now defunct @entity15 team , skidded off the track in wet conditions and collided with a recovery vehicle			1
the @entity3 sustained a " diffuse axonal injury " which causes widespread tearing of nerve fibers across the whole of the brain , according to @entity20 brain charity , @entity21			1
he returned to @entity3 last month and was treated at the intensive care unit of @entity28 ( @entity29 ) before moving on to the rehabilitation center			2
" as we reach the conclusion of a difficult year for our family , we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a further update regarding @entity0 ' medical situation , per our pledge to communicate continued information , when appropriate , to his many fans , " said the driver 's parents , @entity42 and @entity43 in a statement			1
" it was a significant and very comforting step for us to be able to bring @entity0 home to @entity3 last month , to continue his rehabilitation surrounded by his family and friends			1
this is very important for @entity0 and also for us			2
" @entity0 ' neurological status remains unchanged ; he is unconscious but able to breathe unaided			1
whilst there is no significant information to report , we take a great deal of comfort from the fact that @entity0 continues to fight , as we knew he would , and this has enabled the medical professionals caring for him to commence the planned , but very painstaking , program of rehabilitation therapy			2
" @entity0 's parents say they will continue to provide updates of their son 's progress and thanked the public for their ongoing support			2
the statement added : " as we reflect on the events of the past few months , we would like to acknowledge once again the overwhelming warmth and affection shown towards our son			0
these continue to be challenging times for our family , but the knowledge that he has touched the lives of so many people all around the world has helped us through			0
" earlier this month , the @entity79 published a report which stated that @entity0 " did not slow sufficiently to avoid losing control " during his crash at the @entity84			0
@entity0 's @entity15 team folded in november after administrators failed to find fresh investment			0
in the days after the crash , @entity15 moved to address accusations that @entity0 had not reduced his speed and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so			0
" the @entity93 is shocked and angered by these allegations , " said the statement issued in october			0
" at a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital , and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for @entity0 and his family , it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of @entity0 ' accident			1
" regarding point 1 , @entity0 did slow down under the double waved yellow flags			0
that is an irrefutable fact , as proven by the telemetry data , which the team has provided to the @entity79			0
" regarding point 2 , an audio copy of the full radio transmission between @entity0 and the team , and a written transcript , were provided to the @entity79			0
" it is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to @entity0 ' accident did the team urge @entity0 to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so			0
" the update on the @entity3 driver 's condition comes a day after the first anniversary of @entity130 's skiing accident			1
the seven - time world champion is continuing his recovery from the severe head injuries sustained in a crash at the @entity3 ski resort of @entity136 on 29th december last year			1
@entity130 spent nine months in hospital in @entity3 following emergency brain surgery but was moved to the family home near @entity141 in @entity142 in september to continue his rehabilitation			1
while the @entity147 's family declined to give an update on his condition , @entity8 drivers and fans expressed their continuing support for the stricken driver on social media .			2
