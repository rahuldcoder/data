-- @entity2 president @entity1 has warned that the eurozone crisis could have a dire effect on emerging markets if it continues in 2012			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity6 at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity1 discussed the @entity2 's assessment that the coming year could be as bad for emerging markets as 2008 if the eurozone crisis worsened			1
" if there 's a more serious breakdown in the eurozone ... then developing countries have to be prepared , " he said			0
" they have to pre-fund some of their own bonds , they have to look at the trade side , they have to look at the banking side			0
" he said that while developing countries had provided about two - thirds of growth globally over the past five years , " we 're all in this boat together and so if @entity25 really stumbles and fails it 's going to hurt everybody			0
" the @entity2 is trying to shield emerging markets by making $ 27 billion available over next two years , specifically in central and eastern @entity25			1
while each emerging market would weather the crisis differently , he said , " the closer you are to @entity25 , the more you 're going to be at risk			1
" he said the issues underlying @entity25 's crisis were yet be resolved			2
" @entity25 has sort of stumbled up to each crisis , put together a package , managed to get through the crisis , and it 's bought time but it has n't fundamentally addressed the problem			1
" solving the crisis now required " paying attention to the politics of reform , not just the economics of the balance sheet			0
my belief is @entity49 and others need to hold out some carrots if these countries sustain the political support , " he said			0
" it 's really now in my view a question of @entity57 and @entity58			2
@entity60 and @entity61 and others , they 're going to cause waves and issues but they 're much smaller pieces of the problem			0

@entity2 president @entity1 warns the euro crisis has put emerging markets at risk
markets closest to @entity25 will be most at risk , he says
he sees the future of the eurozone as resting on @entity58 and @entity57
