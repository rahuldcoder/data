-- @entity1 may have wanted to just blend in when she started her freshman year recently at @entity3 , but it seems not everyone has the same idea			1
" @entity7 " actress @entity1 is an incoming freshman at @entity3 in @entity8			1
the actress , best known for her role as @entity11 in the " @entity7 " films , showed up last week at the @entity14 school in @entity15 , @entity8 , where new students were treated to orientation activities before the official start of classes on wednesday			1
@entity1 was photographed looking very relaxed in jean shorts and a white t - shirt , but reports are that her introduction to academia has been less than low - key , with much excitement being stirred by her presence			2
the blog @entity29 reported that while the @entity36 actress visited the campus on friday with her mother and her boyfriend , @entity40 , @entity41 user @ cupcakenar sent out the following tweet : " my dad made @entity1 mad by taking a photo of her going inside the financial aid office at @entity3			1
she was with her mom & boyfriend			0
" celebrities furthering their education are not new , but with the advent of social networking sites , stars ' every move can be tracked and reported			0
when actor @entity52 apparently fell asleep during a lecture at @entity54 in @entity55 earlier this year , a photo snapped by a classmate made the rounds online and prompted many a tweet			2
@entity52 , who has appeared in films such as " @entity60 " and the critically acclaimed " milk , " was reported to be taking classes at @entity54 and @entity63 while also writing a book			0
@entity65 were on high alert when @entity67 began attending classes at @entity63 in 2004			0
photos appeared constantly of the tiny twosome -- often with bodyguards in tow -- on their way to and from class after they moved from @entity75 to @entity55 for school			0
stars such as @entity78 , who enrolled in @entity54 , and @entity79 , who attended @entity80 , have tried to be as under the radar as possible while pursuing their education			1
according to a 2003 article about @entity79 in the university 's @entity86 newspaper , the " @entity83 " actress lived on campus her freshman and sophomore years while pursuing a degree in psychology			2
@entity79 told the college publication that she was able to enjoy her time as a student , despite her celebrity status			0
" at the beginning of college i was talking to people who were actors who had gone to college , and i heard awful stories about people getting 200 visitors a year knocking on their dorm room , or having awful stalker issues , " @entity79 said			0
" but i 've not been bothered once , and that 's also thanks to the police here , who have been really wonderful			0
" @entity1 also has been quoted as saying she just wants to be treated as a regular student			0
" i do hope that it will be only a short time before i am known as @entity1 the student from the @entity36 , rather than @entity1 who starred in the ' @entity7 ' films , " @entity1 said			1
the " @entity7 " actress is n't the only famous student taking her seat at an @entity14 school this year			2
the @entity117 reported that actress @entity118 has enrolled in @entity80 's @entity119 's @entity121 program and asked officials to take additional measures to ensure her privacy			1
the paper reported that school officials complied , including having the registrar put a privacy block on @entity118 's file to prevent information about the actress from being made public and arranging to have @entity80 police present during the program 's coffee breaks			1
in speaking with the @entity117 , @entity3 's director of communications @entity135 declined to confirm that @entity1 was a student there , but he did say the school might take extra precautions to protect a young wizard			1
'' we do whatever we need to do to ensure safety and privacy , and that applies pretty much to all students , " @entity135 said .			0
