-- after months of protest , sudden and dramatic events have swept across @entity3 , boosting some and diminishing others			1
with questions swirling about where the president is , who 's in charge and what will happen next , to say there 's uncertainty about the future of this country of 44.5 million is an enormous understatement			1
but some early winners and losers seem to be emerging from the chaos that shook @entity20 last week as security forces and protesters battled to a bloody standstill that left dozens dead and earned the rebuke of @entity26 powers			0
losers president @entity28 : his own party abandoned him as lawmakers voted unanimously to oust him from office			0
he 's facing criminal charges stemming from the deadly crackdown on protesters last week			0
@entity35 : @entity35 officials were mostly sidelined last week as @entity38 foreign ministers negotiated the peace deal that ended the violence			1
@entity3 's opposition appears to be steering the country toward @entity38			1
but @entity43 still retains some bargaining chips : supply lines that provide most of @entity3 's natural gas , a huge naval base in the autonomous @entity49 republic of @entity50 and heavy @entity35 influence on culture , language and business in eastern @entity3			1
@entity3 : this hotbed of @entity57 sentiment has n't seen the sort of rabble - rousing that 's upended much of the rest of the country			1
but that does n't mean the people who live here are n't thinking about it , reports @entity0 's @entity66			0
" certainly , there are a lot of pro-russians in the east of the country who are very afraid of what might happen next , who are afraid that their culture , their heritage are in danger , who feel that the @entity35 language -- which has always had a special status here in @entity3 -- might be in danger of becoming marginalized as well , " he reported monday from @entity67			1
winners @entity86 : the former revolutionary leader and prime minister , freed from prison after the peace deal was signed , has clearly gained in the past few days			2
she had been imprisoned since 2007 on what @entity26 observers and many @entity49 felt were politically motivated charges related to a gas deal with @entity35 provider @entity95			2
she took a position of honor on the @entity99 stage saturday , setting herself up as a possible presidential candidate			0
" today , @entity3 has finished with this terrible dictator , " she told protesters saturday after her release			2
" there 'll be no @entity3 but the @entity49 you want			2
and i 'm the guarantor of that @entity3			0
" @entity3 's opposition : they took over @entity20 's @entity99 for months , held their own against much more heavily armed security forces and then flooded across @entity20 to take control when those security forces vanished in the wake of the peace deal			1
still , the mood in @entity20 was somber as protesters honored those killed in last week 's fighting			0
" this is a lesson for our country and a lesson that will help us to prevent this from happening ever in this country again , " one protester said			0
@entity126 : @entity38 is riding high in the wake of the peace deal largely brokered by foreign ministers from @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 who traveled to @entity20 to help solve the crisis			0
it 's unclear what 's next for the @entity126 and @entity3 , which until late last year were discussing a trade deal that focused on economic modernization in return for long - term aid			1
but @entity126 foreign affairs chief @entity139 was in @entity20 on monday to talk .			0

@entity3 's sudden political *transformation* helps some , hurts others
looking shaky : @entity3 's missing president , @entity35 and its allies in the country 's east
looking up : opposition icon @entity86 , the protest *movement* and the @entity126
