-- as the new school year approaches , president @entity1 has been traveling around talking about the high cost of education			0
in a speech given on august 22 in @entity6 , @entity7 , he laid out a plan to rein in the costs , describing affordable and accessible education as " @entity12 's highest priority			0
" but the education system is n't broken -- it 's " fixed			0
" if we 're serious about tackling the issue of affordable education and student debt , we need to strike at the root of the problem -- the influence of money in politics			1
private corporations like @entity24 -- which own 15 % or $ 162.5 billion dollars of total student debt -- rake in private - island - purchasing profits while students suffer			1
it 's impossible to be on a college campus -- especially a state university -- and not notice the impact of the student debt crisis			1
the debt weighs on our students			1
it is as if you could see it in their slumping postures and staggering gaits as they haul boulders and lug chains from class to class			0
approximately 37 million students currently hold debt , averaging $ 27,500 per person and totaling over $ 1.1 trillion			1
saddled with debt , students are giving up on the idea of the @entity53			1
you know , like the idea that you and your buddy can open up a small ice cream shop in an old gas station and grow it into a multimillion dollar business that cares for the community and delights the world			0
the truth is , if @entity65 and i had had $ 27,000 of debt in 1978 , we would never have taken the risk of opening our first scoop shop			0
more likely than not , we would have been underemployed and buried in back payments			0
in @entity6 , he said : " the idea used to be that here in @entity74 anybody could make it			0
... and , unfortunately , what 's happened is it 's gotten tougher for a lot of folks			0
so we 've got to reverse these trends			0
" but while @entity1 talks about creating policies that will benefit the middle class , corporations like @entity24 are dedicated to preserving the status quo by showering @entity86 with cash			1
according to the @entity88 , @entity24 has donated over $ 1.26 million to federal candidates and parties in the last four election cycles and bankrolled $ 1.93 million dollars lobbying @entity92 in the first half 2013			1
during that time , @entity92 crafted a student loan bill that tied interest rates to financial markets , which president @entity1 signed it into law in august			1
while in the short term , the bill prevented interest rates from doubling , students are more vulnerable in face of an adjustable interest rate that could top 8.5 %			1
corporations like @entity24 borrow at dirt cheap interest rates ( subsidized between .23 % and .34 % ) from the @entity106 banks			1
in contrast , undergraduate students borrow at an adjustable 3.85 % and graduate students borrow at an adjustable 5.4 %			2
that 's a sweetheart deal for @entity24 which raked in $ 2.5 billion in interest payments from student loans last year , but a terrible deal for students			1
in a letter to @entity24 's ceo , sen. @entity115 wrote : " while @entity24 is finding unique ways to profit from government programs , its borrowers are paying interest rates that are far in excess of the low cost of funds supported by the @entity74 taxpayers			2
" it 's time to dam the deluge of cash and corporate influence in @entity12 once and for all			0
whether you 're a college student , a debt holder , a parent or simply someone concerned about the future of our country , you can help			2
there is a stampede rumbling across the country to amend the @entity142 to declare : 1 ) money is not free speech ; and 2 ) corporation are not people			0
at @entity148 , we 're helping to build that movement by legally stamping messages like " not to be used for @entity151 " on our nation 's currency to spread the word and get money out of politics			2
every bill is seen by 875 people , so the more stamped bills that enter circulation , the more movement will grow			0
thanks to the leadership by groups like @entity166 , move to amend , @entity167 , @entity168 for people and @entity170 , 16 states have passed referendums calling on @entity92 to take action and over 150 members of @entity92 support the amendment strategy			2
as the new school semester begins , pick up a stamp and help take back our campus and take back @entity92			2
this is our future and our fight to win			0
