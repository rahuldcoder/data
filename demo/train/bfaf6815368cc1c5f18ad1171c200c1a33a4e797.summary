-- he wears more eyeliner than @entity3 , his voluminous locks put @entity5 's poof to shame and one can only guess how long it takes him to get into his skinny jeans -- though there 's a good chance he 'd tell you if you asked			1
so are the pants and the eyeliner to blame for the fact that it 's been nearly impossible to avoid @entity14 this summer ? between interviews for his new film " @entity17 " and red - carpet appearances with his fianc√©e @entity19 , @entity14 has certainly been making the rounds			1
and judging by " @entity23 's " respectable box - office run , @entity21 are not getting tired of this @entity25 comedian any time soon			1
" he 's completely electric and always on , " says @entity26 , a senior editor at @entity27			1
" it 's like non-stop with the jokes			1
it 's one of the most amazing things i 've ever witnessed			1
... he takes chances and that 's what makes a great comedian			1
" one of those chances was @entity40 -- the supporting but momentous character in 2008 's " @entity41			1
" the role , which was originally written to be to be a writer who looked more like @entity44 than @entity45 , was changed to a @entity14 - like rock star following the comedian 's authentic audition			1
cut to two years later and @entity14 is carrying his first big @entity50 film , " @entity17			0
" the road - trip comedy has performed similarly to " @entity41 , " earning an estimated $ 17.4 million its opening weekend and a respectable $ 36.5 million to date			1
" the truth is as funny as ' @entity41 ' and ' @entity23 ' have been , it 's the tip of the iceberg for him , " says @entity53 news movies editor @entity52			1
" no one has truly captured how funny @entity14 is in person			0
he can host @entity53 's [ @entity59 ] twice in suitably unpredictable fashion , he can riff on any subject , and yes he can act			2
" but there was n't an immediate embrace of @entity14 , says @entity52			0
the @entity25 press were all over @entity14 in 2008 when he resigned from the @entity65 after making a lewd phone call to actor @entity67 during his radio show			0
" it 's taken @entity21 audiences a little while to catch up , but to those in the know , @entity14 is something special -- an erudite improv master who can go blue or highbrow depending on his unpredictable mood , " @entity52 says			2
whether it 's the remarks about former president @entity80 or the fact that he repeatedly poked fun at the @entity83 for wearing purity rings , it took @entity21 some time to get used to @entity14 's humor , says @entity86 , who created the @entity87 in 2005 after watching @entity14 on " @entity88 " in the @entity25 " all he wants to do is make people laugh , " says @entity89 , who lives in @entity90 , @entity91			2
@entity89 has met brand several times since starting the site			2
" to see a comedian who 's quite stylish instead of the dorky or angry comedian that 's so typical			2
... he 's a nice looker , which always adds to the liking of someone , " she says laughing			2
@entity14 's " @entity23 " cast - mate @entity103 told @entity0 that people might be surprised to know just how professional brand truly is			1
" he 's a hard worker and it 's important to him to be funny , " she says			2
we 're finally beginning to appreciate @entity14 's honesty and accept him as the great comedian , actor and rock star he is , @entity26 says			2
" there 's a bit of pain in @entity14 , " he says			0
" it allows him to make jokes about real - life situations			0
... most of us do turn some of the tragedies in our lives into humor			0
" @entity14 channeled his past when he reprised his role as @entity40 in " @entity23 " and when writing his book , " @entity126 : a memoir of @entity128 , drugs and stand - up , " released in the @entity25 in 2007 and the @entity21 in 2009			1
his memoir , which details his rough childhood and past with drug and alcohol abuse , quickly became a best - seller in @entity25			1
" there 's something kind of endearing about him			0
there 's an honesty and an innocence that people respond to , " @entity26 says			0
@entity89 says she often receives e-mails from recovering drug addicts thanking @entity14 for being an inspiration to them			0
" they just kind of resonate with him for being so frank and honest , " she says			0
but how is the honesty that originally turned people off suddenly the very thing that 's making us fans ? " he has a quality about him that i think we can sort of praise and like in our rock stars , but in our comedians , we say , ' hey , he 's not @entity159			0
what the hell ? ' he 's pretty unique , " @entity26 says			0
so what 's next for brand ? a lot , actually : he 'll star with @entity165 in " @entity166 " and " @entity167 , " play the voice of the @entity169 in " @entity170 , " and play a con - man / priest in " @entity173			1
" in addition , his second memoir called " @entity176 : this time it 's @entity180 , " is due out in early 2011 in the @entity21 , and he continues to do stand - up comedy			1
" i ca n't wait to see @entity14 stretch and prove he 's got true range outside of the provocateur he clearly can play with his eyes closed , " @entity52 says			0
@entity26 says @entity14 has nowhere to go but up			0
" he is the peacock of peacocks			0
there 's no one strutting around like he is			0

brand 's role in " @entity41 " was written for him
" @entity126 , " released in 2009 , quickly became a best - seller
brand will soon appear in " @entity166 , " " @entity167 , " " @entity170 " and " @entity173 "
