-- @entity1 did n't pussyfoot around			1
she got @entity2 to confess in the first minute			1
it was a curiously unemotional moment , the prosecutor leading the witness through what seemed like well - rehearsed paces in a businesslike fashion			0
@entity2 said he was sorry for all the years of lying , but he sounded like he was reading a shopping list			1
he may have been wearing a lavender shirt that complemented @entity1 's violet dress , but the disgraced cycling champion was anything but colorful			1
on her cable channel thursday night , @entity1 wisely began with a series of yes - or - no questions that brought a decade of deception to an end			1
did @entity2 take banned substances ? yes			1
in winning all seven @entity23 titles ? yes			0
if you changed the channel then , you did n't miss much			0
watch : why the media fell for the @entity28 girlfriend hoax it was the most eagerly anticipated interview since @entity30 sat down with @entity31 ( except there was no sex , lies and audiotape , just lies )			0
but the event had an anticlimactic feel			0
@entity37 came the leak ( to the @entity39 ) that @entity2 was considering coming clean			1
then came the leak ( to @entity41 ) that he planned to confess to @entity1			2
then came the leak ( to the @entity43 ) that he had in fact told @entity1 he 'd been a doper			2
so all that remained to be seen were what words @entity2 would use and what demeanor he would display			2
watch : @entity50 apologizes to @entity51 ( finally ) he just did n't seem contrite			2
" you brazenly and deliberately denied everything you 've just admitted to me , " @entity1 said			1
" you called other people liars			0
@entity2 did n't so much engage in the interview as endure it			1
he admitted he could not have won those @entity23 titles without doping			0
he said he did n't think he 'd get caught			0
but he never quite explained the audacious , elaborate and endless lying			0
" the story was so perfect for so long , " @entity2 said			2
that 's right , perfectly untrue			0
when @entity1 forced him to watch a videotaped deposition in which he lied about doping , @entity2 appeared halting and detached			1
he later said he was embarrassed but did n't appear so			0
she could not get the man to open up			0
watch : @entity67 's @entity66 : will it come back to haunt her ? @entity2 said he did n't feel he was cheating at the time ; he was leveling the playing field			1
it was as though he was talking about someone else			0
even when @entity2 acknowledged having been a bully , there was no flicker of soul - searching			1
maybe he does n't have a soul to search			2
the sit - down , part two of which airs friday night , was a test for both of them			2
@entity2 's task was to generate enough public sympathy to allow him to salvage a once - glittering career that he single - handedly ruined			1
@entity1 's challenge was to reclaim a bit of the cultural spotlight that she once owned before abandoning her syndicated stardom for the cable netherworld			1
you 've got to say this			0
everyone wanted the @entity2 interview			1
he could have gone to " @entity96 " or the " today " show or " @entity98			0
" but @entity1 landed him			2
she is still seen as having the requisite mix of toughness and empathy to be able to deal with stars who have misbehaved , though @entity2 's misconduct is on a different level than your stereotypical celebrity in rehab			1
watch : is the press demanding that @entity110 party more ? @entity111 , the @entity112 television critic , argues that the landscape has changed			0
by the time @entity1 gave up her show , he says , " the media had fragmented on one front , making it harder for tv to serve as pop culture 's big revival tent for the ritual of confession , forgiveness and rebirth			1
" maybe he 's right			0
i do n't forgive @entity2 , who lied to me in two interviews			1
and i suspect most of @entity126 wo n't , either			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity129 .			2

@entity2 admitted using *performance* *enhancing* drugs in interview
@entity129 says the cyclist failed *key* test of appealing for public 's sympathy
he did n't seem contrite , did n't show any sign of soul - searching over cheating
@entity129 : @entity1 showed her ability to land a big interview and to reclaim stardom
