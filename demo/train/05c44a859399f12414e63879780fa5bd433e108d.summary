but after speaking with her mother tuesday , she decided to waive the complaint			0
if @entity12 wishes to dismiss the lawsuit , it should " be done of her own free will and not due to the extreme pressure of her parents and the media , " @entity109 wrote in court documents			1
@entity35 's case attracted national attention , which @entity22 noted would likely continue to affect @entity12			2
