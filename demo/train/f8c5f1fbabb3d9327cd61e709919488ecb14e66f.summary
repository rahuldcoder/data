marijuana smokers now have a new place to put on their bucket lists : @entity4 , which on tuesday became the third state to officially ok marijuana use			1
following @entity9 's lead , voters passed the @entity11 ballot measure in november			1
legalization became official on tuesday , which means that now " the use of marijuana ( is ) legal for persons 21 years of age or older			1
" there are limits to this law , as there are in similar ones in other states			0
people still ca n't legally have more than 1 ounce of marijuana on them			1
nor can they harvest more than 4 ounces in their home			0
and consuming marijuana in public and driving while high are no - nos. then there 's the fact that the law is n't fully implemented yet			1
the regulatory structure allowing for entrepreneurs to set up shops like those found in @entity9 is still in the works , so right now no one can legally make a living selling the drug			2
not to mention that , under federal law , marijuana is classified as a @entity43 narcotic			1
that makes its use a federal crime			0
is weed legal in your state ? still , as in many states , there seems to be movement in @entity54 on that front			2
@entity57 attorney general @entity56 told @entity0 in october he is " cautiously optimistic " on the subject of marijuana legalization			0
@entity56 said the @entity60 is focused on marijuana distribution to minors , interstate trafficking and drug violence , not incarcerating " low level people who are simply there for possessory offenses			0
" in the absence -- some might say in defiance -- of any sweeping federal change on marijuana , some states have taken the initiative			2
twenty - three states still prohibit cannabis outright			0
but the rest of them have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession			0
@entity9 became the first to go one step further in legalizing pot , followed by @entity54			1
and now there 's one more in @entity4 .			0

@entity4 joins @entity9 , @entity54 in legalizing marijuana use
having 1 ounce or less of pot is now ok , but you ca n't do it in public or if you *'re* under 21
marijuana is still an *illegal* narcotic under federal law
