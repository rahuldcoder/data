-- the parents of a 10 - year - old @entity3 girl waiting for a lung transplant say they have asked @entity6 secretary @entity5 to change the rules that keep children under 12 from being prioritized for donated adult organs			1
attorneys for the family of @entity12 , a 10 - year - old @entity13 girl with cystic fibrosis , have sent a formal letter to @entity5 , requesting that she " set aside " what they 're referring to as the " under 12 rule " that , they say , is preventing @entity12 from getting priority on the adult waiting list for lung transplants			1
@entity12 could die within weeks without a transplant			1
she has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated			0
adult lungs are far more available than lungs from children , and doctors believe modified adult lungs might save the girl 's life			1
" this is in the scope of ( @entity5 ' ) ability to change this law for all of the children rather than let her wait and die , " @entity33 told @entity0 's " @entity38 " monday			2
with just weeks left , @entity12 fights the system for life - saving pair of lungs @entity12 's parents and attorneys are arguing that the rule is making it all but impossible for her to receive a lung , since children 's lungs are so rare			1
as it currently sits , every adult on the list -- regardless of the severity of their illness -- would first have to turn down a pair of lungs before it could be offered to someone under 12			0
in the letter , attorney @entity57 of @entity58 in @entity13 , called the rule " discrimination			0
" " the under 12 rule is unfair , arbitrary and capricious , inconsistent with the statute and regulations , and stands in the way of @entity12 potentially receiving a set of lungs that she needs to live , " @entity57 wrote			1
" it violates her rights under the @entity70 and @entity71 of the @entity72			0
" @entity57 also argues that the @entity12 family is not asking for the secretary to intervene " in favor of @entity12 to ensure that she receives a set of donated lungs			2
" " they are only asking that you exercise your authority to direct that an inflexible policy ... be set aside so that medical professionals can exercise their judgment and @entity12 can be considered for a set of donated adult lungs under the same requirement that apply to persons aged 12 and over			1
" dying girl 's plight sparks fight over organ transplants several lawmakers also urged @entity5 to act			0
@entity3 @entity93 sen. @entity93 and rep. @entity94 co-signed a letter to the secretary saying in part , " you have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for @entity12 and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs			2
" they asked that @entity5 " direct @entity105 ( the @entity106 ) to conduct an experimental variance " and that an example in @entity12 's case would " help better inform the medical community 's understanding of how these transplants work in pediatric settings			1
" @entity3 sen. @entity114 , a @entity115 , wrote a separate letter to @entity5 , requesting her " immediate attention to several crucial questions " and would like answers no later than wednesday			0
the questions include whether it would be possible for @entity121 to suspend the current system while @entity5 ' requested review of the policy for children 's lung transplants is carried out			2
@entity12 is at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her six - state region			2
@entity5 has previously told the family that she does n't have the authority to intervene in a particular case , but she also called for the policy review			0
any change could take up to two years			0
