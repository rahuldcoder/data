-- @entity2 's misfiring start to the @entity4 season continued on saturday with a 2 - 1 loss to @entity6 at @entity7			1
the disappointing league result comes off the back of another lackluster display in the @entity11 in midweek which saw @entity14 's side squander a 2 - 0 lead against @entity16 to eventually draw the match 2 - 2			2
on saturday , it was @entity2 who found themselves two goals down after @entity6 's @entity22 midfielder @entity21 opened the scoring in the 21st minute before @entity24 netted again with 15 minutes remaining			1
the @entity27 striker 's sixth goal in as many league games ultimately sank @entity2 who managed to pull one back through @entity30 but could n't find an equalizer			1
" we had a lot of chances to score but it is difficult to win if you do n't take them , " @entity2 boss , @entity14 said			1
" i do n't think it was a fault of our team for the performance in the first half , it was more about the intensity of @entity6 and you must credit them for that			0
we are just starting the season , we have 80 points left to play for			1
" we will continue fighting because there is no title being handed out at the moment			0
" the win keeps @entity6 in fourth place with 16 points , one point behind @entity2 who failed to make up ground on league leaders @entity61			1
@entity63 's side will extend their advantage to eight points over @entity2 if they beat @entity66 at @entity67 on sunday			1
elsewhere , there were wins for @entity70 who rise to second place thanks to a 1 - 0 win over @entity74			2
@entity76 's side kept the winning habit with their sixth victory in seven league matches and now have 19 points from nine matches			1
@entity82 scored a brace to give @entity84 all three points against @entity86 -- the @entity86 have now conceded 10 goals in two matches after shipping eight last weekend			2
the win gave @entity90 a first league win in four matches and lifts the @entity93 up to fifth with @entity95 one place behind following a 2 - 0 win at @entity97			1
@entity98 could only draw 0 - 0 at home to @entity100 -- a result which sees @entity103 ' side slip to seventh in the table			0
@entity105 and @entity106 also shared the points in a 2 - 2 draw at the @entity109			2
@entity111 slump continues @entity111 's nightmare start to the @entity114 season continued with a fourth straight league defeat on saturday against @entity116			1
@entity118 's 62nd - minute winner consigned @entity120 's team to a third home defeat of the league season and a sixth loss in all			1
their spectacular lack of league victories -- the latest defeat leaves @entity111 hovering above the relegation places in 15th -- is in stark contrast to the club 's @entity11 form where they are riding high in @entity132 with three wins from three matches			2
compare that to a league run that has yielded one point in the last six games			2
" we ca n't do more , but we can do things better , @entity120 said following the latest setback			0
" we are n't in a good situation in the @entity114 and that 's something we have n't come to terms with until now			0
we 'll continue to fight , the opponent made a lot out of little , we made nothing out of a lot			0
" there was little to lift the gloom at @entity152 either as their manager @entity153 was shown the door on saturday following friday 's 1 - 0 loss to @entity156			0
@entity152 are without a win this season and are currently anchored to the foot of the table with four points from nine matches			1
the club has appointed under - 23 coach @entity164 as caretaker manager until a full time replacement can be found			0
there was joy , however , for @entity169 who claimed all three points in a 5 - 4 win at @entity173			2
@entity174 and @entity175 both scored braces as the visitors leapfrogged @entity111 into 14th place			0
there were also wins for @entity180 who rise to ninth and @entity183 who move up to 11th			0
at the business end , @entity185 move up to second after a 1 - 0 win over @entity188 while @entity190 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity191 lifts @entity193 's side to fourth			0
@entity194 will go six points clear at the top of the table if they beat @entity198 on sunday			0
