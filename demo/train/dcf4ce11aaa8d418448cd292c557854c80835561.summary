-- a bright red cross marked the cover of a manifesto purportedly written by the suspect in last week 's terror attacks in @entity6			1
nearly 6,000 miles away , @entity8 police seized white robes emblazoned with the same symbol in a series of raids aimed at cracking down on one of the country 's newest drug cartels			1
the @entity16 -- warriors during the medieval holy wars known as the @entity19 -- wore the cross insignia as they went into battle			1
its red color represented the blood of christian martyrs			0
the recent modern - day interpretations of the crusaders ' ancient cause would n't sit well with the original @entity16 , according to @entity29 historian and novelist @entity28			1
" they 'd have been horrified			0
... they were very devout people , " said @entity28 , who detailed the knights ' history in his book " the @entity16			1
" the knights began in the 12th century as a religious order fighting @entity38 and protecting @entity40 pilgrims to the @entity41			1
they mostly came from @entity42 and took strict vows of poverty , @entity28 said			0
but over time , their organization amassed significant wealth and property , drawing ire from citizens and royalty alike			0
amid accusations of heresy and devil - worship from @entity56 's king , the pope dissolved the order in 1312 , @entity28 said			2
the group 's last leader was burned at the stake , but the story of the @entity16 lives on , portrayed in films and popular fiction such as " the @entity64			1
" now authorities are investigating @entity6 attack suspect @entity67 's purported manifesto , which claims that another group using the @entity16 name intends to carry out " shock attacks " across @entity42 in a campaign to fight @entity71 and " cultural @entity72			1
" authorities accuse @entity67 of killing at least 76 people when he set off a car bomb outside government buildings in @entity77 last friday , then ambushed an island political youth retreat			0
@entity67 's lawyer told reporters that his client was " a little bit surprised " that he was able to pull off the bombing and shooting rampage , for which authorities say he has claimed responsibility			2
separately , @entity8 officials blame members of a new criminal organization that use the @entity16 name for extorting business owners , decapitating and dismembering kidnapping victims and setting vehicles ablaze to block roads during shootouts with police			1
the original @entity16 ' noble ideals and dramatic demise give them " an aura of glamour and mystery , " said @entity101 , an associate professor of ancient and medieval history at @entity103			1
@entity101 and other historians argue that most fictional accounts of the group focus on unsubstantiated myths and conspiracy theories and that recent reappearances of the @entity16 name in @entity6 and @entity8 are just the latest attempts to manipulate their legacy			1
" the drug gang and the murderer are trying to cloak the horror of their acts with the glamour and ideals of this religious order , " @entity101 said			1
striving to be ' the perfect knight ' the rambling , 1,500 - page account that constitutes @entity67 's purported manifesto includes excerpts from a @entity125 entry about the @entity16 and pictures of sword - wielding medieval knights wearing cloaks and armor			1
@entity0 has not independently confirmed that @entity67 is the author of the manifesto , which bears his name and says it is intended to be circulated among sympathizers			2
the writer rails against @entity38 and their growing presence in @entity42 , and calls for a @entity137 civil war to overthrow governments , end multiculturalism and execute " cultural marxists			2
" the author also makes numerous references to what he describes as a new incarnation of the @entity16 , which he says was " re-founded as a pan-european nationalist military order " during an april 2002 meeting in @entity147			2
the manifesto details necessary steps to become a " @entity150 , " including pledging a @entity16 oath			1
" any candidate prepared to walk this road must be willing to forfeit his materialistic ambitions and embrace voluntary poverty and martyrdom , " @entity67 writes			0
" you are operating as a jury , judge and executioner on behalf of all free @entity137			0
... there are situations in which cruelty is necessary , and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a betrayal of the people whom you wish to protect , " he continues			0
in a diary - like log of events leading up to last week 's attacks , the manifesto 's author says he is trying to set an example			2
" i am one of many destroyers of cultural @entity72 and as such ; a hero of @entity42 , a savior of our people and of @entity180 -- by default			0
... the @entity182 i have always strived to be , " he writes			0
@entity101 , the historian at @entity103 , said such assertions show a clear misunderstanding of the @entity16			1
they confronted @entity71 on the battlefield and @entity71 returned the favor			0
they did not , to the best of my knowledge , ever engage in massacres of unarmed combatants , " he said			0
" they were not terrorists and would n't have approved of it			0
" ' they want to demonstrate that they 're courageous ' the new @entity8 cartel known as the @entity16 announced its presence earlier this year			1
banners hung in prominent locations -- and photographed by local media -- vowed to protect residents of the @entity8 state of @entity207			2
" our commitment to society will be to preserve order and prevent robbery , kidnapping and extortion , and protect the state from interventions by rival organizations , " the signs said			0
for months , authorities and analysts said they suspected the @entity16 had split from one of the nation 's most notorious criminal organizations , @entity223 -- a cartel known for its mix of ruthless violence and religious ideology			1
@entity8 's government said @entity223 's founder , @entity229 , was killed in clashes with authorities last year			1
in a dossier released as they announced his death in december , officials described @entity235 as a " spiritual leader " who used religion to strengthen his stronghold			0
the government file said @entity235 dubbed himself the " savior of the people " and outlined the cartel 's philosophy in a " bible " provided to new recruits			2
the discovery earlier this month of the white robes with red crosses and handbooks outlining a code for the @entity16 showed further evidence of a connection with @entity223 , authorities said			2
" presumably they were indoctrinating their members , " @entity8 federal police spokesman @entity256 told @entity257			2
for the splinter group , choosing the @entity16 name was no accident , said @entity263 , a professor of government at the @entity265			1
" they want to demonstrate that they 're courageous and valiant , but at the same time they are generous , " said @entity263 , who studies @entity8 's organized crime syndicates			1
he said the alleged leader of the @entity16 , a former lieutenant of @entity223 known as " @entity274 " -- the teacher -- " has the same kind of religious inspiration " as @entity235			1
while some of the cartels ' leaders may believe in its ideology , @entity263 says others have a more pragmatic approach , using religion as a " recruiting device			0
" " now you 're at one with the @entity285 , even as you decapitate people and carve ( messages ) into the bodies of your opponents , " he said			0
promoting peace , fighting a ' social cancer ' another group that uses the @entity16 name has been waging its own campaign to distance itself from the @entity8 drug gang and the @entity6 attacks			1
the international @entity40 nonprofit known as @entity297 issued a statement saying their group is not and has never been affiliated in any way with @entity67			2
" @entity304 's message is one of love , understanding and tolerance of all peoples of the world , " the organization said in a statement			0
" how @entity67 so misunderstood and corrupted @entity304 's message is beyond reason or belief			0
" the organization 's @entity8 chapter also issued a statement saying it has no connection to the drug gang , which it referred to as a " social cancer			1
" the statement lambasted the criminal group for committing acts that are " full of shame , dishonor and totally contrary to the principles of the order			2
" @entity327 , the grand commander of @entity297 , said the organization 's more than 6,000 members around the world regularly support charitable projects , such as helping fund reconstruction of a @entity38 mosque and a @entity40 church in @entity335 following mudslides there			0
" obviously it 's very distressing for me and for all of our members to see our name bandied about by the drug cartel and this deranged person in @entity6 , " he said			1
" unfortunately , we do not have exclusive rights to the words ' @entity16			2
' those words have been in the public domain for almost 1,000 years			0
" members can join @entity297 only by invitation , @entity349 said , but the organization has no particular church affiliation , and provides humanitarian aid to anyone in need , regardless of race or creed			0
" we have no political or religious agenda , " he said			0
" our agenda is basically all about bringing about peace , reconciliation and understanding			0
" journalist @entity363 , @entity364 and @entity366 's @entity365 contributed to this report .			0
