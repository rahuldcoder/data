" @entity117 also noted that @entity6 had failed to disclose the e-mails to the @entity103 lawyers despite a legal requirement to do so			2

" he 's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever , " @entity6 told @entity1 two months later to refute reports @entity5 's health was threatening the concerts			1
the @entity50 story , however , said the e-mails indicated major doubts about @entity5 's ability to perform			1

" @entity5 is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time , " one e-mail from the show 's music director read , the paper reported			2
