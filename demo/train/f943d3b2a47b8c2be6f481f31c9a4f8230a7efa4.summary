@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was only a matter of time before someone shrunk the dazzling computer wizardry used to pilot a fighter jet into a device the size of an @entity10			1
we 're not there just yet , but aviation engineers have unveiled a semi-working prototype they say will soon allow pilots to carry cockpit technology in their flight suit			1
the aviation warrior , created by @entity21 defense contractor @entity19 , was among a raft of new aircraft gadgets on display at the @entity25 's @entity0 that appear to be adapting technology popularized by phones and tablet computer devices to fly modern jets			1
@entity2 was given a first glimpse of @entity19 's revolutionary system on the sidelines of the event			1
if it proves successful , it could mean the difference between life and death for a pilot downed behind enemy lines			1

this powers a heads - up display on the pilot 's helmet and a small screen on their wrist			2
using these , a pilot can view full - color terrain maps and virtual images of the landscape around them on displays that adjust as they move their heads			1
their helmets also relay surround - sound audio alerts , giving directional warnings of incoming missiles			2
already an advance on current in - cockpit systems , the warrior technology will enable pilots to navigate through " brown out " conditions when dust or bad weather obscure land and hazardous buildings			1
it will also pinpoint enemy and friendly positions			2
but whereas existing equipment must be left behind if the aircraft goes down and the pilot becomes separated -- now they can take the technology on the hoof			2
" all the information they would typically have in a cockpit , with this new system they have it on their person , so when they leave the aircraft , they still have it with them , " @entity84 , president of @entity85 , told @entity2			0
infographic : up in the air : aviation industry in numbers theoretically , the warrior system could have been utilized in situations such as the notorious @entity104 incident during the 1990s @entity106 conflict			2
@entity21 @entity108 pilot @entity107 spent six days on the run from @entity111 patrols , eating grass and grubs to survive , after ejecting over @entity111 territory in june 1995			0
his ordeal was loosely adapted into the @entity117 movie " @entity119 , " starring @entity118			0
" instead of the hide and seek of previous conflicts , particularly the @entity123 , where a pilot would hunker down and wait for rescue , they now know how to get ( to ) safety , " said @entity84			0
the warrior system 's wrist display uses the same " pinch - to - zoom " touch screens found on @entity10 -- something its manufacturers believe will make it popular with pilots			1
touch screens are becoming increasingly popular in cockpits , replacing the enormous banks of complicated dials and switches used to control some modern aircraft			0
@entity143 aerospace company @entity142 used @entity0 to unveil a programmable touch screen that allows pilots to customize and upgrade controls			0
so far , investment in the experimental warrior system is relatively small			0
the @entity21 military has awarded @entity19 a $ 4.7 million research and development contract			1
but if rolled out across helicopter and fixed - wing fleets , it could prove big business			0
watch : three ceos in a cockpit @entity84 refuses to discuss warrior 's battery life -- an issue that blights user of many modern smart phones fitted with satellite tracking and other power - draining apps -- saying only that it meets military operational requirements			1
he also declines to reveal its price , but @entity168 's chief engineer @entity167 insists its use of commercially - available components makes it relatively low cost			0
" we 're using off - the - shelf items that are cheap and simple to upgrade , " he said			0
added @entity84 : " it 's about leveraging what 's commercially available			0
we 're introducing this in an austere environment and we 're acutely aware of that			0

*future* military tech may *include* the ability to pilot a fighter jet using an *iphone* - sized device
@entity19 displayed new aircraft gadgets this week *including* the " aviation warrior "
" aviation warrior " tech will allow downed pilots to navigate enemy terrain after leaving their aircraft
