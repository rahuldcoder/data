-- they say football can take over your life and now @entity7 @entity6 side @entity5 have taken that adage to its extremes			2
@entity5 fans have long filled @entity7 's leading football arenas with the chant " @entity13 lang , @entity14 und @entity16 lang " ( " a lifelong blue and white " ) but now , the club has ensured that such devotion can officially last a lifetime -- and beyond			1
for devotees of the side lying second in the @entity6 and currently topping their @entity23 group can , from next month onwards , be laid to rest in a cemetery specifically made for @entity5 fans -- one which lies in sight of the team 's @entity28 home in @entity30			1
" you can start your life with @entity5 by getting baptized , you can get married at the stadium and now you can be buried at the @entity5 cemetery , " @entity5 's public relations officer @entity31 told @entity0			1
" the @entity5 cemetery is a unique project and as far as we know there is nothing comparable in @entity39			2
" the rising fortunes of the @entity41 have been assisted in recent years by signings of the caliber of former @entity45 star @entity44 and current @entity47 striker @entity46 , with @entity5 having achieved four second - place finishes in the @entity6 since the turn of the century and reached the last four of the @entity23 in 2011			1
off the pitch , the club has also been growing			0
three years ago , @entity5 opened a delivery room in the maternity wing of a hospital close to the @entity28 , so that newborns can enter the world in a room with blue and white coloring and where @entity5 logos and images adorn the walls			1
with the club also providing baptisms and weddings , the introduction of the cemetery project -- which is known as the @entity65 -- takes the array of services offered by the club into the afterlife as well			2
however , adverse weather conditions have delayed the opening of the historic cemetery -- which features 1,904 plots in commemoration of the year the club was founded -- until the middle of december but fans are already snapping up the limited places			1
given that the team with seven championship crowns ( albeit with the last dating back to 1958 ) has long been one of @entity7 's most popular sides , plots at a stadium - shaped cemetery -- which will be bedecked in blue - and - white flowers surrounding a tiny rectangular " pitch " featuring two goals and a floral @entity5 emblem -- may not last long with over 100 having already been taken			1
this is despite a cost of $ 6,639 ( 5,406 euros ) , a price which does not benefit the @entity6 club itself but which does guarantee 25 years of grave maintenance , as provided by a company headed up by local real estate agent , and former @entity5 trialist , @entity103			2
with no current plans to extend the one - off project beyond the 1,904 graves available , the @entity5 cemetery -- which lies within the city 's larger @entity107 - @entity106 cemetery -- will have a certain exclusivity , and one family have already decided to move a late relative 's remains from his initial resting place to this new home			1
plots to have already gone include number 04 , for obvious reasons , and number 215 which has been allocated to a fan who wanted it in memory of @entity5 's leading @entity39 triumph in 1997 , with the club winning the now - defunct @entity127 on 21 may -- or 21/5			1
" for a normal person , i think this decision is insane -- but not for me			0
i have supported @entity5 for almost 26 years now so for me , it 's just an additional way of showing my support			2
either you are a really huge fan or just a fair - weather fan -- i am a really huge supporter , i love my club and think it 's a good idea , " @entity136 , who is just 34 , told @entity0			0
" you pay for the care , so no one needs to care for the grave , and for me , it 's like a pioneering project as well , so i am really proud of it			0
@entity5 is part of the culture in @entity30 because after the mines were closed in our city , there has been a lot of unemployment			0
" without @entity5 , there would n't be anything here and the opinion of many people , not just myself , is that the city lives from the club			2
" when asked whether he had made provision for any future family members , the unmarried sales manager laughed freely before admitting it was a topic he had given little thought to			0
" these are questions i have n't thought about yet but i do have a girlfriend			0
i told her i had bought her a grave but she looked surprised -- as she is not a football fan , she does n't really get it , " replied @entity136 , who says he was attracted by the " unique " nature of the offer			0
" one of my married friends also wants to buy a plot and i think his wife will understand as she knows that when she married , she married @entity5 as well			0
otherwise , i am not sure the marriage would work as being a die - hard supporter , which includes traveling the country , takes up a lot of time			0
" despite the high cost , @entity136 is convinced a number of @entity5 fans are so devoted to the club that many will soon embark on setting funds aside to buy a plot in future			1
meanwhile , @entity191 -- whose wife runs a cemetery garden business -- says the idea came to him after noticing a mix of @entity5 pennants , flags , season tickets , player photos and blue - and - white flowers were already decorating hundreds of gravestones in the western city of @entity30			0
" the feedback has been very good , not just in terms of the number of graves already taken up , which we did n't expect to be so high , but also in terms of the fan and media interest too -- and it has n't only come from @entity5 followers either , but other supporters too , " says @entity191 , 39			2
" there has been some criticism though , with some people feeling it is not @entity218 to designate an area of the cemetery for people of a certain , and smaller , group			0
but on the whole , people like the idea			0
" helpfully for @entity103 , @entity226 - @entity225 , a retired pastor and @entity5 fan himself , has countered the protests by saying that dozens of supporters had been requesting a special final home with links to the club for a number of years			1
@entity5 are not the first football club to open a cemetery for their fans , with @entity238 's @entity237 having created one with 3,000 plots in 2007 while @entity242 's @entity241 have entered the market in different fashion , offering fans a @entity246 which effectively serves as a life insurance policy .			1

@entity5 to open stadium shaped cemetery for club 's fans from next month
@entity5 founded in the year 1904 and the cemetery will contain that number of graves
@entity5 now provides a birthing room , baptisms , marriages and now a final resting place
@entity237 of @entity238 opened a similar *ceremony* five years ago
