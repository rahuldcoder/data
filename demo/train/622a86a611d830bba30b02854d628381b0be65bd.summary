with all the health setbacks he has endured , @entity0 is used to comebacks			2
he made another one friday at the exhibition @entity5 in @entity6 but it did n't last long , as the 14 - time grand slam champion was crushed by @entity9 6 - 2 6 - 0 in the semifinals			1
while @entity0 most certainly would have wanted to put up a better showing , he 'll probably just be happy -- for the moment -- that he has physically recovered from the appendix surgery that forced him to skip the year - end @entity14 in @entity15 last november			1
he 'll have a little over two weeks to find his game before the start of the year 's first grand slam , the @entity19 , and he vows to make progress			1
next week the @entity21 -- who suffered a back injury in last year 's @entity19 final and skipped last year 's @entity24 with a wrist complaint -- competes at the @entity26 in nearby @entity27			1
" there are only small things i need to adjust , " @entity0 , who has competed in just three @entity14 tournaments since @entity29 , was quoted as saying by the @entity30			0
" 6 - 2 6 - 0 is too much -- i had a lot of chances to have a closer result , " he added			1
" i have to improve , that 's obvious , and i 'm going to improve			0
this match helps me and the defeat does not affect me too much			0
" i felt i was dominating the points a lot of times , but i am missing competitive spirit			0
i am going to keep working hard			0
" @entity9 , too , knows what it 's like to return from injuries			2
the two - time grand slam winner from @entity47 underwent back surgery late in 2013 and never really found his form in 2014 , achieving one grand slam semifinal			1
his body is feeling better , though			0
the off - season has certainly been eventful for @entity9			2
he cut ties with his co-coach and good friend @entity55 and longtime fitness trainer @entity56			0
in happier news , however , he announced his engagement to girlfriend @entity59			0
@entity9 faces a rematch with world no. 1 @entity62 -- @entity9 's pal and victim in both of his successes in grand slam finals -- on saturday			1
@entity62 ousted @entity68 's @entity67 6 - 1 6 - 2 in the other semifinal			1
it was @entity67 who upended the @entity72 en route to the @entity19 title in 2014 , breaking up the dominance of the @entity76 .			2

@entity9 routs @entity0 6 - 2 6 - 0 at the @entity5 exhibition tournament
the semifinal in @entity6 marked @entity0 's comeback from appendix surgery
the 14 - time grand slam winner also suffered back and wrist injuries in 2014
@entity9 meets @entity62 in saturday 's final after the @entity72 beat @entity67
