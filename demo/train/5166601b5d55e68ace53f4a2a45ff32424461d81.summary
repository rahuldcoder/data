-- @entity1 is looking to take over a good chunk of the @entity3 -- if not the entire @entity5 world			1
at least , that 's the message the terrorist movement is sending in its @entity9 online magazine , @entity8			1
in @entity8 's first issue , which debuted in early july , the magazine declared that a " new era has arrived " for @entity5			0
photographs in the webzine of @entity1 militants in @entity17 armored vehicles rolling through @entity18 seemed to buttress that claim			1
graphic photos of dead soldiers from @entity18 forces litter the pages of each of the issues of @entity8 , and articles detail skirmishes across @entity18 and @entity28			1
each issue of the magazine -- there have been four so far , appearing at roughly monthly intervals -- starts with a foreword that contains an inspirational message for readers , before diving into longer pieces that extol the virtues of @entity1 and provide updates on the group 's military campaign			1
@entity1 members fervently believe that they have established a true " caliphate " in the areas that they control , a supposed distant echo of the perfect @entity46 rule of the @entity47 and his immediate successors in the seventh century			2
overall , the magazine is quite religious in tone			0
excerpts from rulings by @entity5 scholars are included in every issue , as are religious rationales for the actions of @entity1			2
in the most recent issue , an @entity1 writer reasoned that capturing women from the @entity60 , an @entity18 minority group , to use as sex slaves was acceptable under @entity1 ' version of @entity65 law , since the @entity60 are polytheists , a great heresy in @entity46			1
showing some convoluted logic , the @entity1 writer also asserted that enslaving @entity60 women is a good way to stop adultery , since a man having sex with a concubine is legal under @entity1 ' interpretation of @entity46 law , but sexual relations outside of marriage with free women are forbidden			2
the magazines are also , unsurprisingly , highly sectarian , repeatedly showing images of @entity83 shrines and tombs that have been blown up by @entity1 , a organization made up of members of the @entity88 sect			1
@entity1 believes these sites to be idolatrous			0
@entity91 soldiers -- who are generally @entity83 -- are referred to as " apostates " and graphic photos of their executions by @entity1 fighters are a staple of the magazine			1
other articles aim to reassure readers that @entity1 , which in june renamed itself the @entity100 , is an actual state that provides social services and reconstructs critical infrastructure			2
the magazine asserts that administrators govern towns after the main @entity1 fighting force moves on and the most recent issue of @entity8 includes photos with captions showing " services for @entity5 , " including street cleaning , electricity repairs , care homes for the elderly and cancer treatment centers for children			2
the first issue of @entity8 even had a sort of classified ad for " all @entity5 doctors , engineers , scholars , and specialists " to come and join @entity1			0
the most recent installment of @entity8 asserts that two new wilayat , or provinces , had been established in the region where the @entity28 - @entity18 border had once been			1
the magazine describes the new provinces as a successful step in " eliminating any remaining traces of the kufri , nationalistic borders			0
" pictures of a military parade celebrating the announcement accompany the article , along with pictures of a well - staffed checkpoint , a bustling marketplace , and @entity1 police patrolling the area			0
in many ways @entity8 is not a new phenomenon			0
@entity150 's @entity149 during the 1980s @entity147 war against the @entity148 produced a similar magazine , @entity151 , which was widely available around the @entity5 world , was translated into many languages and was principally a fund - raising and recruiting tool designed to encourage young @entity5 men to travel to @entity147 and neighboring @entity157 to support the @entity147 jihad			0
more recently , @entity159 from its headquarters in @entity161 has been publishing @entity162 , another well - produced online magazine			1
@entity162 , published for the past four years , clearly served as something of a model for @entity8			0
both are well laid out and feature graphics and photos prominently			0
the @entity8 feature titled " in the @entity171 , " where a helpful quote from an official or analyst from the @entity175 is included , is a direct copy of an @entity162 feature			0
@entity177 's most recent issue features a portion of @entity17 secretary of defense @entity180 's testimony before the @entity182 in which he discussed how much of a threat @entity1 is to the @entity17			0
but the two webzines share few similarities beyond that			0
@entity162 was very much focused on recruiting lone - wolf jihadists and inspiring homegrown extremism in the @entity175 , but @entity8 includes only a few vague sentences about carrying out attacks in the @entity175			2
where @entity162 included instructions on bomb - making and building weapons to carry our attacks in the @entity175 , @entity8 focuses almost entirely on the actions of @entity1 in @entity18 and @entity28 and encourages followers to join the jihad there			1
in the third issue of @entity8 an @entity1 writer asserts , " this life of jihad is not possible until you pack and move to the @entity205 , " meaning to leave your home and travel to @entity1 ' areas of control in @entity18 and @entity28			1
the purpose of the @entity8 webzine is quite different from @entity162 : it is to encourage and perpetuate @entity1 ' successful insurgencies in @entity18 and @entity28 , not to foster homegrown extremism or lone - wolf attacks in the @entity175			1
that 's about the only good news that one can glean from @entity8 .			0

@entity1 has published four issues of online magazine detailing its aims
@entity222 says the group is *stressing* its *territorial* *ambitions* and sectarian approach
unlike @entity159 , which recruits terrorists *vs.* the @entity175 , @entity1 wants to be a state , he says
@entity231 : @entity1 is focused on sustaining and extending its insurgencies in @entity28 and @entity18
