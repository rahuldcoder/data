watching your health this @entity0 does n't have to be scary			1
here are five easy things to keep in mind for you and your family to stay happy and healthy this @entity0			1
eat before you ( trick or ) treat hopefully you 've already talked to the kids about their trick or treat strategy			1
mentally prepare them not to snack while they 're walking , and do n't be one of those parents who drives them from door to door			1
" talking to them in advance ( about not snacking ) makes it a lot easier , " said @entity17 , a registered dietitian with @entity18 of @entity19			1
she also makes sure her sons trick or treat on a full stomach			1
" i know it 's crazy that night with everything going on , but you should make it a huge priority that your kids eat dinner before you go out , " @entity17 said			1
" even a quick peanut butter - and - jelly sandwich and a piece of fruit			1
kids are really in tune with their appetite and wo n't be as tempted to snack if they are full			1
" it 's only after @entity17 's little @entity41 and @entity42 get home this year that they can pick out a piece or two			1
binge eating -- for child or parent -- is not allowed			1
did you know the sugary loot children collect on @entity0 adds up to about 11,000 calories , according to @entity18 testing ? ( they were vague about what happened to the candy afterward			1
) that 's the equivalent of a week 's worth of calories			1
the candy also packs an average of 365 teaspoons of sugar -- the equivalent of 12 double - dip vanilla ice cream cones -- and the same amount of fat as 15 large servings of fast food @entity65 fries			1
what to do with all that candy ? " i would never recommend hiding food as it makes it more valuable to the kids , " @entity17 said			2
" if you keep it in the house , it should be free game for mom and dad as well as the kids			2
" pure chocolate stays good for about two years without causing any real health risks , although the texture changes after about 12 months			2
if you are counting calories as you snack , sugar candies tend to be lower in calories than chocolate			2
dentists hate the sticky stuff , though , as it is harder on your teeth			2
if your child has food allergies , be sure to read candy wrappers			2
keep in mind , mini-size servings of the candy you know and love can contain different ingredients than their larger cousins			2
@entity101 has a daughter , @entity102 , with severe peanut and tree nut allergies			2
she founded the @entity105 and says @entity0 is her busy season			1
she advises parents to talk to their neighbors about keeping a separate bowl of allergen - free candy for kids like her daughter			2
parents who worry about their kids eating @entity0 candy could try the @entity117 method , also called the @entity118 or @entity119			1
it 's like the tooth fairy : your kids set out at least some of their candy before they go to bed			2
the fairy , witch or pumpkin comes in the middle of the night , takes it and leaves behind something they want , like a toy or tickets to something they want to do			2
@entity17 does this at her house			2
my kids are actually willing to give up their candy , really , " @entity17 said			1
trick or drink maybe pumpkin ale is more your thing than pumpkin candy			1
because it 's a long night of waiting for the doorbell to ring , there is an easy trick to fool yourself into drinking less : try a skinnier glass			1
scientists at @entity154 watched how much people pour and learned people struggle to assess volume , tending to focus more on the vertical rather than the horizontal measures			1
participants poured around 12 % more wine into a wide glass than a standard one			2
drink from a narrower glass and you 'll only think you are drinking more			1
plus , you 'll get a little exercise if you do have to get up for that refill			0
zombie - proof your face watch what you put on your face : you do n't want a bad mask or face painting accident to leave your co-workers wondering why you are still in costume on friday			0
the @entity175 suggests testing face paint on a small area on your arm			0
that way you can see if it irritates your skin before you slather it everywhere			0
skin around your eyes is extremely sensitive , so check labels on face paint or makeup			0
if it says avoid applying by your eyes -- even if the people on the package are doing the opposite -- follow the directions			0
throw away makeup that smells bad , as it may be contaminated			0
if your inner devil prefers a mask , wipe it down before wearing it			0
you likely were n't the first to try it on in the store			0
@entity198 affiliate @entity197 took more than a dozen masks to be tested			1
even the biologist was shocked by how many germs and molds he found			1
" in terms of gross , this is particularly disgusting , " said @entity203 , a biologist from @entity204			0
the microscopic monsters can cause infections			0
pay particular attention to the nose and mouth			0
just because @entity214 wore them ... color contacts made @entity214 look extra spooky in " @entity217 , " but unless you 've got a prescription , do n't wear them			0
some stores do sell them , but that 's illegal without a prescription			0
optometrists warn the contacts are n't one - size - fits - all			0
" wearing lenses that do n't fit properly can suffocate the eye , causing irritation and infection , " dr. @entity227 , director of @entity228 in @entity229 , said in a statement			0
" bad infections can even lead to blindness and / or loss of the eye			0
" if you want to wear them , get a prescription			0
do n't let chocolate go to the dogs if you dress up your pet , make sure the costume lets them breathe and move			0
avoid costumes with small parts they might swallow			0
speaking of eating , chocolate may be a favorite in your goodie bag , but it can be deadly to dogs and cats			0
pet insurance company @entity258 sees 25 % more claims during @entity0 -- more than any other week in the year			1
swallowed wrappers and lollipop sticks can cause blockages that might not be noticed for days			0
the darker the chocolate , the deadlier it is to your pet , according to dr. @entity266 with the @entity267			0
" when kids come home after a night of trick or treating and dump their bag of candy , be sure that your pets are safely away in another room away from your kid 's loot , " @entity266 said			1
store it somewhere where your pet ca n't get to it			0
