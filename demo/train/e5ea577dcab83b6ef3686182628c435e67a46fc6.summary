-- last weekend , actor @entity1 tweeted that he has decided to withdraw his support for his movie " @entity4 " due to its violent content			1
@entity1 said he became uncomfortable with the violence in light of last year 's tragic @entity8 in @entity9			2
people must make their own decisions about what media are appropriate for themselves and their family , and i respect @entity1 's choices			2
yet , as someone who researches media violence , i worry that some will draw the wrong message from his position			1
existing data do not link media violence with mass shootings or other societal violence			1
debate continues in the general public and within academia , but the evidence just is n't there			0
the @entity31 and @entity33 @entity32 , in a joint report in 2002 , found no evidence that school shooters consume more violent media than others			1
and although media probably have become more violent in recent decades , this period has also seen a massive decline in youth violence to 40 - year lows , not an increase			1
experimental evidence from social science has been mixed , and many of the studies are of poor quality			1
one scholarly paper that endorsed the " harm " view suggested religious books with violence such as the @entity55 would cause aggression just as much as a violent movie , something of which readers may wish to be aware			1
the @entity33 @entity60 rightfully rejected evidence such as this as unpersuasive when considering the @entity64 violent video game case in 2011			0
so why do beliefs about media violence persist ? periods of moral panic tend to surround media			1
media from penny dreadfuls ( trashy novels popular in the 19th century ) to comic books to music ( jazz , @entity76 , rock music , etc. ) to books such as @entity79 have often been blamed for society 's ills			0
after events such as the @entity8 rampage , blaming the media can actually be reassuring			0
we construct the narrative that an individual such as @entity88 might never have committed his horrific crimes if not for the crucial influence of media			0
such narratives give us a sense that the uncontrollable might be controlled			0
and to maintain them , we simply ignore cases that do n't fit them , such as a rash of violence in the months after @entity8 committed by elderly men with no discernible connection to violent media			1
this allows us to maintain an illusion of correlation where none exists			0
professional advocacy groups such as the @entity107 share some of the blame in promoting unnecessary fears			0
as i detail in a recent report for the journal @entity113 , previous statements by the group have been error - prone on even basic details , such as the number of studies , and simply omit those studies that conflict with alarmist messages			0
unfortunately , people often take these policy statements too seriously , forgetting professional advocacy groups tend to benefit politically by identifying social crises their professions can help " fix			0
" the committees that write these statements have historically included scholars highly invested in a particular ideological view of media reviewing their own work and declaring it beyond debate ( a chance i 'd love to have with my own work one day )			1
they should not be mistaken for careful , neutral , objective reviews			0
there are real dangers in focusing too much on media as the cause of violent crime			2
speaking as a mental health provider , i 've seen no tangible improvement in the delivery of mental health services in the @entity33			1
it is a tragic , lost opportunity when we squabble over the old culture wars surrounding media , rendering media bashing as the new " twinkie defense " for criminal defendants			0
parents certainly deserve to have full information on ratings systems for media and existing controls			2
a recent @entity158 suggested that individuals unfamiliar with the @entity161 ratings systems for games , for instance , were those most concerned about video games -- suggesting that , as with previous moral panics , unfamiliarity breeds fear			0
granted , media companies could work more -- in conjunction with schools perhaps -- to keep parents informed about the options available to them to restrict their children 's exposure to violent imagery ( and for the record i have no financial or personal ties to media industries )			2
but parents also have the right to have a full understanding of the research , its inconsistencies and limitations , and this is something the research community could do better			0
debates on media have been going on for more than 2,000 years and wo n't end in our lifetimes			1
but we must remember that the most powerful impact these debates have is in their ability to distract us from the real causes of violence : poverty , inequality and the lack of attention to mental health			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity205 : actor tweeted he wo n't support his new movie due to violence
@entity203 : existing data do not link media violence with shootings or other violence
he says scholars use , at best , mixed study results to blame media for violent *behavior*
he says it distracts from roots of violence : poverty , inequality , poor mental health care
