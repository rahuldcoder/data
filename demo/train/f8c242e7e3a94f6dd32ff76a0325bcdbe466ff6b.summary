-- three @entity3 researchers have won the @entity4 in physiology or medicine for solving " a major problem in biology , " the @entity1 announced monday			1
@entity9 , from left , @entity10 and @entity11 will share the $ 1.4 million prize			1
@entity11 , @entity10 and @entity9 are credited with discovering how chromosomes are protected against degradation -- a field that could shed light on human aging and diseases , including cancer			1
" the award of the @entity4 recognizes the discovery of a fundamental mechanism in the cell , a discovery that has stimulated the development of new therapeutic strategies , " the committee said in a news release			0
the three will share the $ 1.4 million prize			1
it is the 100th year the prize will be awarded , and the first time that any @entity1 in the sciences has gone to more than one woman			1
the work that won them the prize took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s			2
it centers on structures at the end of chromosomes called telomeres and an enzyme that forms them , called telomerase			1
as cells divide , chromosomes need to be replicated perfectly			2
work by the researchers determined that telomeres protect @entity52 from degradation in the process , and that telomerase maintains the telomeres			2
though there had been some speculation that the three scientists were being considered for the @entity1 , the committee keeps its work top secret -- and all three researchers said they were surprised			1
@entity9 told @entity0 he got the news in " that classic early morning phone call from @entity64			1
" he described it as " surprising and exciting " -- perhaps particularly for him because he has not worked on the subject for the past 20 years			0
" i 've been working on other things , " he said			0
" it started off as a collaboration with me and @entity71 [ @entity72 ] -- @entity10 [ @entity10 ] was a student of hers			1
" the work began as " a long - standing puzzle that we were interested in solving , " he said			0
" it was only over later years that it emerged , through the work of many people , that this was probably important for aging and cancer			1
" how it might help fight such diseases is not yet known , @entity9 said			1
" it will take a while yet for that to be figured out			0
" @entity72 and @entity10 did not immediately return calls from @entity0			1
in a telephone conversation with the editor - in - chief of the @entity4 web site nobelprize.org , @entity10 said she had been attracted to the field of research because " it seemed like the unanswered question			1
" she also said telomere research has a higher proportion of women than other fields because in its early days , the lead researchers brought women into the field			0
she called it a situation in which " you have someone that trains a lot of women and then there 's a slight gravitation of women to work in the labs with other women			0
" she added , " i think actively promoting women in science is very important because the data has certainly shown that there has been an underrepresentation			0
and i think that the things that contribute to that are very many ... subtle , social kinds of things			0
" @entity72 , in a separate conversation posted on the web site , said the proportion of women in telomere research is " fairly close to the biological ratio of men and women			0
" " it 's all the other fields that are aberrant , " she added , laughing			0
the field of study intrigued her because " it 's so intricate and complicated , and you want to know how it works , " she said			0
@entity72 was @entity10 's supervisor at the @entity143			1
now @entity72 is at the @entity143 , @entity144			0
@entity10 is a professor at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147			2
@entity9 was previously at @entity148 and is currently professor of genetics at @entity151 in @entity152 , @entity153			2
married with two children , he told @entity0 he has " no idea " what he 'll do with his portion of the monetary prize -- about $ 467,000			2
@entity0 asked whether he thinks his children , ages 9 and 12 , will suddenly think dad 's work is " really cool			0
" " well , " @entity9 said , laughing , " maybe			2
" @entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity1 says *prize*winners** solved " a major problem in biology "
*winners* studied structures at the end of chromosomes called telomeres
their research relates to understanding aging , diseases including cancer
