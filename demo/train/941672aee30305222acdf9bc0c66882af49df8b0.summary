-- " the dignity of the @entity2 presidency has been tarnished ! @entity4 must investigate			0
let 's make sure this type of tragedy never happens again			0
and how do we know that was really @entity9 ? maybe it was a hologram or a body double ! " the above are just the ( slightly ) exaggerated responses of some in the cybersphere to the revelation that @entity9 might have lip - synced all or part of the national anthem at monday 's presidential inauguration			1
there are simply too many people in this country who go from zero to ( faux ) outrage in a matter of nanoseconds			2
just look at @entity27 and you will see the overuse of capital letters by people who feel @entity32 and robbed by the possibility of @entity9 's prerecorded performance			1
the @entity35 , which provided the musical accompaniment for @entity9 , is neither confirming nor denying that she lip - synced to a prerecorded track , although earlier a spokeswoman said the pop star " did not actually sing			1
" the @entity35 did explain that @entity9 , like all singers at the inauguration , made a recording of the song she was scheduled to sing which would be played " in case of freezing temperatures , equipment failure or extenuating circumstances			2
" to be honest , if @entity9 did lip sync the entire song she should be nominated for an @entity51 for outstanding acting in a @entity53 , because it looked amazingly real			2
and i worked at " @entity55 " in 2004 when @entity56 had her infamous lip - syncing meltdown so i have seen up close the horrors of bad lip - syncing			2
it 's not that i 'm unsympathetic to those who wanted to experience @entity9 singing live			2
there 's truly no substitute for live performances			0
( although on nights when i 'm tired , i wish i could lip - sync some of my jokes to a prerecorded track , but alas , that 's not allowed in my field -- yet			1
) and true , @entity70 sang a great version of " @entity73 " live at the inauguration			0
however , to those outraged by the thought of @entity9 's possible lip - syncing , you need to keep a few things in mind			1
first , there 's no dispute that was @entity9 's voice we heard			0
this is n't a @entity85 type scandal where a singer lip - synced to songs actually sung by others			1
secondly , performing to prerecorded tracks has been done at previous presidential inaugurals as well as at other big outdoor events because of audio concerns posed by weather conditions or technical issues			1
indeed , at president @entity97 's 2009 inauguration , music legend @entity95 mimicked playing his cello to a prerecorded track because the frigid weather would have made it too difficult to play live in tune			1
and at the @entity107 in @entity108 , the majority of musical performances in the opening and closing ceremonies were performed to prerecorded tracks , including ones by iconic bands like @entity111 and the @entity112 , because of acoustic issues with the outdoor venue			2
( @entity116 members were told well in advance that some songs would not be performed live			0
) obviously , this is not an uncommon practice in special situations			0
plus , this is clearly different than if people had paid to see @entity9 in concert and she lip - synced most , if not all , of her songs			1
that would have been wrong , just as it was when @entity128 did it during her 2009 tour			0
in fact , @entity128 's overuse of lip - syncing so angered people in @entity136 that lawmakers there actually considered passing a law requiring that concertgoers be informed if parts of a show will be lip - synced			1
@entity9 has n't responded about whether she did lip - sync			1
if she did , it could have been for a very valid reason , such as concerns about the weather or acoustics , or maybe nerves -- even superstars must get a little nervous when they see a crowd of close to a million people			0
unfortunately for @entity9 , this issue will not go away quickly , because she 's scheduled to perform in less than two weeks during the @entity155 halftime show			0
there 's no doubt reporters will hound her regarding whether she will be singing live or not			0
but to me , the real question people should be asking is : who is going to win the @entity155 ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0
