when @entity1 took her daughter to @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , for a tonsillectomy , she thought it would be a short stay			2
" when i walked her into that hospital , she was perfectly fine , " @entity1 told @entity10 's @entity9			0
" there was nothing wrong with her			0
she had no health problems			0
" after the december 9 surgery , @entity17 , 13 , woke up and asked her mother for a popsicle			1
but a short time later , the teen started bleeding from her mouth and nose			2
@entity1 watched in horror as @entity17 went into cardiac arrest			1
doctors later declared @entity17 brain - dead and told @entity1 they were going to take her off life support			1
her parents are fighting the hospital 's decision , asking for just a little more time			0
" the big question is , ' how in the world did this happen ? ' " said @entity10 senior medical correspondent @entity32			2
" you 're talking about a tonsillectomy , right ? " tonsillectomy is the third most common surgical procedure performed on children in the @entity40 , according to the @entity41 , after circumcision and ear tubes			1
while not as common in adults , tonsillectomy joins the list of other common surgical procedures , such as appendectomy , cholecystectomy ( gallbladder removal ) and cesarean section			1
but just because these surgeries are routine does n't mean they 're 100 % safe			0
there 's a reason the consent form you sign at the hospital is so detailed			0
while your surgeon may have successfully performed this particular procedure thousands of times , each patient is different			2
your risk does n't change because the person who was on the operating table before you survived			0
" the complications are very rare , " said dr. @entity65 , director of the @entity66 and @entity67 at @entity68			1
but " uncontrollable bleeding can happen in almost any surgery			1
in extreme cases , you can bleed out			0
" in general , @entity65 said , the most common post-surgery complications are bleeding , infection and damage to nearby tissue			1
during a tonsillectomy , for example , surgeons are removing the tonsils , two oval - shaped pads , near the back of the throat			1
to do so , they must cut or burn away the tonsils , which could lead to a small artery being nicked			0
usually surgeons will stop the bleeding by cauterizing it , @entity65 said , but some people do n't clot well			2
a 2003 study of more than 14,000 tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy patients in @entity90 examined the post-operative complications for these surgeries			1
( an adenoidectomy removes the patients ' adenoids and is commonly done alongside a tonsillectomy			1
) @entity97 occurred in about 3 % of the patients ; five needed a blood transfusion			2
another study done in @entity101 in 2004 that included more than 33,000 tonsillectomy patients found about 1.3 % were delayed in being discharged or returned to the hospital in the 28 days after surgery			1
eight patients received a blood transfusion			0
one death was reported during the study period			0
the statistics are slightly higher for other common surgical procedures			1
a study of 1,254 laparoscopic cholecystectomies done in the @entity114 found complications in 12 % of the patients			1
yet the risk of death is still low ; a 1996 meta - analysis found the mortality rate for gallbladder removal was between .086 % and .74 %			0
certain patients are at greater risk during general surgery than others , @entity65 said			2
patients with pre-existing conditions such as heart , lung or liver problems are more likely to suffer from complications or die			2
" the stress of surgery can be too much for you to be able to maintain ( your body 's ) equilibrium , " @entity65 said			0
obese patients are also at greater risk			0
a small study published in 2012 showed severely obese children undergoing tonsillectomies had an increased risk of complications during their surgeries			1
but what if the patient 's body is n't at fault ? what if it 's the surgeon who messes up ? medical errors kill more than 200,000 people every year in the @entity40 , according to a study published in september			2
add them all up and " you have probably the third leading cause of death " in the country , dr. @entity159 , senior vice president for patient safety and quality at @entity161 , told @entity10 during a 2012 investigation into common medical mistakes			0
10 shocking medical mistakes @entity65 said patients should tell their surgeons " everything that they know about themselves , " including their past experiences with surgery and anesthesia , whether they have any allergies , and if they 're prone to bruising or heavy bleeding			1
" the question people should always ask is , ' do i need this surgery ? ' " @entity65 said			0
" in some cases not having surgery is riskier than having the surgery ... but for many , many things , the surgery is quite discretionary			0

@entity17 , 13 , was declared brain - dead after a tonsillectomy
tonsillectomies are the third most common surgical procedure for @entity40 children
complications are rare , but uncontrolled bleeding can happen
patients should ask themselves if they really need the surgery , expert says
