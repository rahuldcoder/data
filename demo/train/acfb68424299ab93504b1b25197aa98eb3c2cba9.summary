-- so you 're ready to go			0
you 've booked your flight , arranged your accommodation and booked a rental car			2
awaiting is a week of motoring through @entity7 's magical countryside			1
but what 's it really like to drive in @entity7 ? is it as nerve - wracking as it 's made out to be ? do you need the skills of a @entity14 driver to cut it on the nation 's dog - eat - dog superstrade ? certainly , driving in @entity7 's main cities can be a white - knuckle experience but head out to the country and you 'll find that the pace slackens and the roads are a lot less stressful			1
to help you on your way here are some insights based on years of experience and tens of thousands of kilometers			0
@entity0 : @entity7 for honeymooners driving styles @entity7 drivers are fast , aggressive and skillful			1
lane hopping and late braking are the norm and it 's not uncommon to see cars tailgating at 130km/h			2
do n't expect people to slow down for you or let you out			0
rather , seize the moment			0
as soon as you see a gap , go for it			0
@entity7 expect the unexpected and react swiftly but they 're not used to ditherers so whatever you do , do it decisively			1
road etiquette much driving etiquette is dictated by unwritten rules			2
flashing , for example , means ' get out of the way ' or ' do n't pull out ' coz i 'm not stopping '			0
but if an approaching car flashes you , it 's warning you that there 's a police check ahead			1
similarly , the car horn can mean everything from ' watch out ' to ' @entity59 ' to ' let 's celebrate , the traffic light 's just turned green '			1
city challenges when driving in cities watch out for traffic restrictions			1
many city centers are off - limits to unauthorized traffic and if you slip into a @entity68 ( zona a traffico limitato -- reduced traffic zone ) you risk being caught on camera and fined			1
city driving also involves dealing with one - way systems , scooters appearing out of nowhere and narrow streets better suited to horse - drawn chariots than modern cars			1
to escape the worst mayhem , drive in the early afternoon when traffic is at its lightest and parking is easier			1
which brings us to ... parking parking is a major headache			2
space is at a premium in towns and cities and @entity7 's traffic wardens are annoyingly efficient			1
car parks do exist but they usually fill up quickly , leaving you to park on the streets			2
if you park between blue lines make sure to get a ticket from the nearest meter ( coins only ) or tabaccaio ( tobacconist ) and display it on your dashboard			1
note , however , that charges do n't apply overnight , typically between 8pm and 8am			0
@entity0 : driving @entity103 's @entity102 des @entity100 petrol stations you 'll find filling stations all over but smaller ones tend to close between about 1pm and 3.30pm and on sunday afternoons			2
this is n't as irritating as it might sound as many have self - service ( fai da te ) pumps that you can use any time			2
simply insert a bank note into the payment machine and press the number of the pump you want			0
remembering , of course , to distinguish between benzina ( petrol ) and gasolio ( diesel )			0
what to carry in the car apart from your driving license , car documents , insurance papers and reflective safety vest , which you 're legally obliged to carry , it 's worth having some coins for parking meters			1
also , if you 're travelling with kids , keep some plastic bags to hand			0
car sickness is a real possibility on winding country roads and things can prove messy unless you 're prepared			2
car hire hiring a car in @entity7 is easy enough -- agencies are widespread and all the usual rules and regulations apply			1
but bear in mind that a car is generally more hassle than it 's worth in cities , so only hire one for the time you 'll be out on the open road			1
also , think about what kind of car to get			0
rural road surfaces are not always the best and many agriturismi and beaches lie at the end of long , axle - busting tracks			0
similarly , road signs can be iffy in remote areas , so consider paying for sat nav			0
top drives here are a few roads to try out			0
