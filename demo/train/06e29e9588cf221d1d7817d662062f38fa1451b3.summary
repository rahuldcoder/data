-- @entity3 's first female president @entity1 will take office on monday in the shadow of two giants -- the first is the specter of a nuclear - armed @entity8 and the second is the legacy of her father , former military dictator @entity11			1
the daughter of the assassinated strongman of @entity3 , @entity11 , 61 , will be sworn into @entity17 's presidential @entity15 promising a conservative policy of " trustpolitik " with its volatile northern neighbor -- a concept that emphasizes what she has called " mutually binding expectations " between the two sides			1
the policy stands in contrast to that of former president @entity29 , who demanded an end to @entity32 's nuclear arms program as a condition of economic aid			1
his hard line stance came under fire towards the end of his tenure for having achieved little , and for even having further strained relations between the two @entity41			0
it 's hoped that @entity11 's softer carrot - and - stick approach will tease concessions from @entity32 at a time when relations have reached an all - time nadir			1
in 2010 , the @entity8 shelled the @entity3 island of @entity49 leaving two marines and two civilians dead			2
@entity32 claimed @entity17 provoked the attack by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the @entity56			1
that same year , @entity8 was also accused of sinking a @entity3 warship , killing more than 40 sailors			2
the incidents caused widespread anger in the @entity3			2
" as one @entity3 proverb goes , one - handed applause is impossible			0
by the same token , peace between the two @entity41 will not be possible without a combined effort , " @entity11 told @entity64 magazine before winning december 's elections			2
" for more than half a century , @entity8 has blatantly disregarded international norms			0
but even if @entity17 must respond forcefully to @entity32 's provocations , it must also remain open to new opportunities for improving relations between the two sides			2
" precisely because trust is at a low point these days , @entity3 has a chance to rebuild it			0
in order to transform the @entity79 from a zone of conflict into a zone of trust , @entity3 should adopt a policy of ' trustpolitik , ' establishing mutually binding expectations based on global norms			1
" fiscally conservative and advocating tax cuts for business to boost investment and jobs , @entity11 also has plans to restructure welfare programs and boost the country 's flagging birth rate			1
regarded as a cold and somewhat distant figure , the 61 - year - old president - elect is no stranger to politics and personal tragedy			0
although she was well - known in @entity3 politics -- she was effectively the @entity101 first lady after @entity8 agents killed her mother in 1974 -- @entity11 only launched her political career in 1998			1
in the wake of the disappointments of the @entity107 , she took a seat in the @entity109 on a wave of nostalgia for her father who was assassinated in 1979			0
@entity11 -- one of the founders of modern @entity3 who assumed power in a coup d'etat -- was shot by his own intelligence chief			1
the memory of @entity11 still divides @entity3 -- some regard him as the cornerstone of @entity3 's present prosperity , others as a dictator who ignored human rights and crushed dissent			1
while she has apologized for human rights violations during his rule , @entity11 has been criticized for not doing enough to distance herself from his legacy			0
@entity11 , who is unmarried , has won plaudits for being the first woman to win an election in a deeply patriarchal @entity3			1
" i have no family to take care of and no children to pass wealth to			0
you , the people , are my family and your happiness is the reason that i stay in politics , " @entity11 told a press conference after winning the election			0
however , @entity148 , professor of international relations and business at the @entity151 , told @entity0 her long - held position as a star in the firmament of @entity3 politics may have carried more weight at the polls			2
" that a woman could be elected in @entity3 is historic and important			0
at the same time , what you basically have to do is be political royalty			0
i think gender roles are changing in @entity3			0
it 's a step forward , but let 's also remember how unique she is as a person			0
" while relations with @entity8 play better overseas than on the domestic stage , where many voters are now inured to the daily threats that emanate across the border , analysts say @entity11 may be better equipped than her predecessor at coaxing concessions -- especially in its nuclear program -- from the @entity8			0
@entity11 visited @entity32 and met with former leader @entity178 in 2002			1
she is considered among a small coterie of @entity3 insiders who have the confidence of @entity32 , and analysts believe @entity11 will pursue a policy of economic concessions with the @entity8 , promoting commercial ties and promoting trading zones in a bid to ease tensions .			1
