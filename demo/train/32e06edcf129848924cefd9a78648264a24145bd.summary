-- in this winter of his disinterment , we pause to ponder if @entity5 , the last @entity6 king of @entity7 , was a victim of a pen poisoned by history controlled by his @entity11 successors			1
as archeologists sort through a skull and bones found under an @entity7 parking lot and with dna tests confirming the remains were @entity5 's , there is a call for a re-examination of his legacy -- which has mostly been shaped by @entity22 's play @entity5 @entity22 's @entity5 is a " rudely stamp 'd , " " deformed , unfinish 'd " villain who ordered the deaths of anyone who stood between him and the throne , including his two young nephews			1
@entity5 : the mystery of the king and the car parking lot " so wise so young , they say , do never live long , " @entity5 says in a sinister aside as he dispatches crown prince edward , 12 , and brother @entity33 , 9 , to their deaths in the @entity36			1
" off with his head ! " @entity5 shouts in @entity39 , sending @entity40 to the chopping block			2
@entity22 's story evolved from a history penned by sir @entity45 more than two decades after @entity5 died in the @entity46 in 1485			1
it was the last fight in the @entity48 , which ended with the ascension of @entity50 and the @entity11			0
the @entity11 , who controlled more 's world , had a vested interest in disparaging @entity5 and bolstering their family 's claim to the throne			2
the @entity61 has " been working since 1924 to secure a more balanced assessment of the king and to support research into his life and times , " according to the society 's website			0
the recent excavation of the burial site that once was a church " has raised the king 's profile and provided us with new opportunities to make the case for ' @entity33 , ' " the society said			1
opinion : @entity5 still the criminal king @entity61 chairman dr. @entity75 opined in a piece for @entity0 that a " cursory reading of the known facts will show that the @entity11 representation of @entity5 , especially that in @entity22 's well known play , just does n't stand up			1
" as @entity81 advised @entity5 in @entity22 's @entity82 : " an honest tale speeds best , being plainly told			1
" " it would make such a difference if people would start to look into the history of this much maligned monarch without the old prejudices , " @entity75 wrote			2
" perhaps , then , they will see past the myth and innuendo that has blackened his name and find the truth			0
" you may not find a saint , " but neither was he a criminal , " @entity75 said			0
" all but one of the so - called crimes laid at his door can be refuted by the facts			0
" that crime was the killing of the rival nephews , known in history as the " @entity107 , " he said			0
and there are other suspects , including @entity50 or other @entity11			0
radiocarbon dating , radiological evidence , dna and bone analysis and archaeological result confirmed the remains found under the parking lot , the former site of @entity121 church , were those of @entity5 , researchers at @entity111 told reporters monday			2
clues coaxed from the skeleton may shed " a new light " on the physical description of @entity5 as a humpbacked man with a " withered arm , " which was used to support history 's evil image of him , professor @entity131 , head of the @entity111 's @entity132 , said			1
" our archaeological research does not tell us anything about the character of @entity5 , and of course his physical condition and appearance were not a manifestation of his character , @entity131 said			0
comparing the new archeological finds to history texts " could end up re-writing a little bit of history in a big way			2
" one immediate discovery is that his skeleton does not have a " withered arm " as depicted by @entity22 , the researchers said			0
while not humpbacked , he did suffer from " severe scoliosis " that appeared to start around the time of puberty , they said			0
the confirmation of @entity5 's remains may make no difference in the royal world , but it does mean the king will finally get a proper burial			1
his body will be reinterred in the @entity164 early next year			0
" a hearse , a hearse , my kingdom for a hearse , " more than a few punsters tweeted upon that news			0
the rehabilitation of @entity5 moves ahead tuesday when the @entity61 unveils a " new " face for their hero based on facial reconstruction using the newly - found skull			1
to poach a phrase from @entity177 's mouth , spoken as he held the jester @entity179 's skull : alas , poor @entity5 ! uncovering the story behind the bones			1

@entity22 depicts @entity5 is a " rudely stamp 'd , " " deformed , unfinish 'd " villain
discovering his grave is a new chance to make a case for ' @entity33 , ' supporters say
@entity5 's bones could mean " re-writing a little bit of history in a big way , " researcher says
@entity5 's " new " face based on the newly - found skull is unveiled tuesday
