@entity0 -- it may not be the prettiest , but the world 's smallest , cheapest personal computer is inspiring a wave of delightful @entity7 innovation among tech hobbyists across the planet			1
with a price tag of just $ 25 , the unassuming @entity10 is an easily - programmable , open - source single board computer , about the size of a credit card , whose cost , size and low power requirements make it ideally suited for backyard inventors			1
described by its creator , @entity23 professor @entity22 as " an attempt to try and reboot some of that 1980s computer industry feel , " the technology has been embraced by creative hackers worldwide and put to use in home weather stations to hot air balloon tracking and camera systems			1
the @entity10 has been shortlisted in @entity0 's @entity30 " @entity32 " awards , with judges citing its affordability , power and accessibility to children			1
as part of the exhibition accompanying the prizes , examples of creative uses of @entity10 are on display at the museum until july 7			1
they include a stylish , personalized train departure board created by @entity47 of @entity48 , @entity49 , which provides the times of the next trains to @entity52			0
" it 's great to have a dedicated piece of connected hardware that looks nice and sits and waits to be useful , " he said			2
" whenever i 'm thinking of leaving the house i can easily check the next train time			2
plus , it looks good on the wall ... no longer do i end up hanging around on the cold train platform			0
" read / watch : why everyone wants a slice of @entity10 @entity65 and @entity66 created @entity67 , an air quality and weather surveillance station that uses @entity10 to take readings from an array of sensors , translating the data into meaningful information and uploading it on to the internet			1
the project cost only Â £ 55 on top of the cost of the @entity10			1
@entity79 said the team had designed the device and set up a website " not only to take our own air quality and weather readings but to encourage and teach others to do the same -- and hopefully eventually create a network of measurements coming in from across the world			0
" she said one of the key benefits of @entity10 was the ease with which components could be added to the board , which , combined with its cost , made it a great entry point to introduce children to electronics			1
" i think the user - friendliness of computers has gotten to the extent that far too many people simply have no idea what goes on inside them , " she said			0
" inventions like the @entity10 really help to change that			2
" a team from @entity108 created a private cell phone network by connecting the @entity10 to a radio interface			1
" we 've shrunk a 30 - foot base station into a three - inch @entity10 and created our own mobile phone network , " said @entity112 's @entity111			1
" this proves what can be achieved through low - cost off the shelf - systems			2
" read / watch : demystifying cloud threats and firewalls in a more playful spirit , @entity123 created a car out of @entity126 that is controlled using the console from a gaming system			0
" it is easier than ever ( and less scary than ever ) to have your computer control your house , move a robotic arm , turn a wheel , read the temperature , or speak your weight , " he said			0
" the sky is the limit			0
" high - altitude ballooning enthusiast @entity139 can attest to that			0
he 's using @entity10 to track and transmit photographs from his unmanned balloon flights , which have ascended 40.5 kilometers ( 25.2 miles ) into near space with a camera			2
" the pi has plenty of memory and processor power , meaning that it can take several photographs and then send the best image to transmit , " he said			0
" balloon payloads swing and rotate a lot and many of the images will be directly at the sun or the black sky , and my software rejects all of those			0
" @entity139 , whose @entity10 invention is n't included in the design museum exhibition , is tinkering on improvements that will allow him to send better and larger images from the flight , and is optimistic of besting his highest altitude on the next flight			2
" i 'm hoping to fly this in the next few weeks , " he said .			0

@entity10 s an easily - programmable , open - source computer that sells for $ 25
its cost , size and low power requirements have made it a hit with backyard inventors
creative uses of the @entity10 are on display in @entity0 's @entity30
they range from home weather surveillance stations to personal mobile phone networks
