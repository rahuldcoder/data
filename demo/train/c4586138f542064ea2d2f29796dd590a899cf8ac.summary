-- sir @entity1 , ceo of @entity2 , accidentally told everyone in the world that his company will be supplying image sensors for @entity8 's @entity7			1
in an interview late friday with the @entity12 's @entity11 , the @entity2 chief was talking about earthquake damage to 15 of the @entity2 's factories in @entity15 , and inadvertently mentioned that a camera sensor made in one of those plants is on its way to @entity8 , and that sensor would be delayed because of the quake and tsunami			1
@entity1 did n't specifically say that @entity2 is building an 8 - megapixel image sensor that will go into the @entity7 , but since @entity2 is currently not manufacturing any image sensors for @entity8 , this confirmed that @entity2 plans to supply components of the @entity7			1
this points to the distinct possibility that in the @entity7 , @entity8 will no longer be using those @entity30 5 - megapixel image sensors currently inside the @entity31			1
this is supported by an analyst 's report from february of this year saying that @entity30 might lose out on supplying cameras for the @entity7 because @entity30 's 8 - megapixel sensor wo n't be ready for the @entity7 's rumored mid-summer launch			2
because @entity1 was talking about the irony of supplying the company 's best camera to @entity8 , we can only surmise that he was talking about an 8 - megapixel sensor			2
here 's what the @entity12 wrote about @entity1 's quote when reporting on its own event this morning : early on , he raised the irony of @entity2 supplying camera components for @entity8 devices			0
it " always puzzles me , " he said			0
" why would i make @entity8 the best camera ? " it is unclear what devices he was talking about as @entity2 is n't known to supply key camera components , known as image sensors , to @entity8 ; a @entity2 spokeswoman declined to comment and an @entity8 spokesperson could n't be reached for comment			0
@entity1 's inadvertent slip also lends credence to the rumors of a delayed release of the @entity7			0

@entity2 will be supplying image sensors for @entity8 's @entity7
a camera sensor will be delayed because of the quake and tsunami in @entity15
@entity8 will no longer be using @entity30 5 - megapixel image sensors
