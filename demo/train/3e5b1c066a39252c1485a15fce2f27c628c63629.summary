@entity0 -- that bar of soap you used once or twice during your last hotel stay might now be helping poor children fight disease			1
@entity9 and his @entity0 - based @entity10 collect used hotel soap from across the @entity12			1
instead of ending up in landfills , the soaps are cleaned and reprocessed for shipment to impoverished nations such as @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
" i was shocked just to know how much ( soap ) at the end of the day was thrown away , " @entity9 said			1
each year , hundreds of millions of soap bars are discarded in @entity24 alone			2
" are we really throwing away that much soap at the expense of other people who do n't have anything ? it just does n't sound right			2
" @entity9 , a @entity18 native , thought of the idea in the early 1990s , when he first arrived to the @entity12 and stayed at a hotel in @entity34 , @entity35			1
he noticed that his bathroom was replenished with new soap bars every day , even though they were only slightly used			2
" i tried to return the new soap to the concierge since i thought they were charging me for it , " @entity9 said			1
" when i was told it was just hotel policy to provide new soap every day , i could n't believe it			2
" @entity9 called his father -- a former soap maker in @entity18 -- and shared the experience			1
" my dad said people in @entity24 can afford to throw it away			2
but i just started to think , ' what if we took some of this soap and recycled it , made brand new soap from it and then sent it home to people who could n't afford soap ? ' " for @entity9 , collecting soap is " a first line of defense " mission to combat child - mortality around the world			1
each year , more than 2 million children die from diarrheal illness -- the approximate population of @entity71 , @entity72			2
according to the @entity74 , these deaths occur almost exclusively among toddlers living in low - income countries			2
" the issue is not the availability of soap			2
the issue is cost , " @entity9 said			1
" make $ 1 a day , and soap costs 25 cents			2
i 'm not a good mathematician , but i 'm telling you i 'm not going to spend that 25 cents on a bar of soap			0
i 'm going to buy sugar			0
i 'm going to buy medicine			0
i 'm going to do all the things i think are keeping me alive			0
" when you fall sick because you did n't wash up your hands , it 's more expensive to go to the hospital to get treated			0
and that 's where the problem begins and people end up dying			2
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity99 @entity9 , 41 , is familiar with the stress that poverty and displacement can create			1
almost 30 years ago , he fled @entity18 with his parents because of the mass torture and killings by former @entity18 military dictator @entity106 , he said			1
witnessing the devastation of his homeland shaped @entity9 's mission and still haunts him today			1
" it 's a long - term grieving process that sort of never ends , " he said			0
" as a child coming from school , passing dead bodies for 10 solid years -- ' it 's not cool , ' as my son would put it			0
a lot of my friends were orphaned , and i was lucky			0
" @entity9 and his parents fled to @entity19 , where he would visit friends and family in refugee camps and struggle to survive -- sometimes without basic necessities			1
" we lost everything , " @entity9 said			1
" we did n't live in the camps , but we sacrificed a lot			0
the people worse off lived in the camps			0
soap was so hard to come by , even completely nonexistent sometimes			0
people were getting so sick simply because they could n't wash their hands			0
" @entity9 transitioned from the tough life of a refugee to become a college graduate , a @entity12 citizen and a field coordinator for @entity139 , a private humanitarian aid organization			1
but he has not forgotten his roots -- or the fact that many refugees in @entity144 continue to lack access to basic sanitation			1
" as a new immigrant and a new citizen to this country , i feel very blessed to be here , " he said			0
" but it 's important , as @entity144 living in the @entity152 , that we do n't forget what we can do to help people back at home			0
it 's not good enough for us to complain about what other people are n't doing for us			0
it 's important that we all band together , think of an idea and pursue it			0
" with the support of his wife , local friends and @entity0 - based hotels , @entity9 began his @entity10 in 2009			1
so far , 300 hotels nationwide have joined the collection effort , generating 100 tons of soap			0
some participating hotels even donate high - end soaps such as @entity172 , which retails up to $ 27 for a single bar			2
volunteers across the @entity12 collect the hotel soaps and ship them to the group 's warehouse in @entity0			1
on saturdays , @entity0 volunteers assemble there to clean , reprocess and package the bars			0
" we do not mix the soaps because they come with different ph systems , different characters , smells and colors , " @entity9 said			1
" we sanitize them first , then heat them at very high temperatures , chill them and cut them into final bars			0
it 's a very simple process , but a lot of work			0
" a batch of soap bars is only released for shipment once one of its samples has been tested for pathogens and deemed safe by a third - party laboratory			0
the @entity10 then works with partner organizations to ship and distribute the soap directly to people who need it -- for free			1
to date , the @entity10 has provided more than 100,000 bars of soap for communities in nine countries			1
@entity212 is one organization that has benefited			0
last summer , @entity9 personally delivered 5,000 bars of soap to @entity212 's @entity216 's home of @entity218 orphanage			1
" when we were distributing the soap , i could sense that there was a lot of excitement , joy , a lot of happiness , " said @entity9 , whose work was recently recognized by the @entity220 , which declared may 15 as @entity221 in @entity0			1
" it 's a reminder again of that sense of decency			0
they have ( someone ) who knows about their situation , and is willing to come and visit them ... to come and say , ' we are sorry ... we 're here to help			0
' " want to get involved ? check out the @entity10 website at @entity241 and see how to help .			2
