@entity0 -- in many respects it was like a meeting of old friends : @entity6 listening carefully -- laughing heartily at one point -- to colorful recollections of former @entity0 bookie @entity9 , who ran a successful bookmaking operation that he inherited from his father			1
but this was no remember - when reunion between two elderly men			0
the 84 - year - old @entity9 , who lives in @entity15 and uses a wheel chair , testified friday as a prosecution witness at the federal trial of @entity6 , who is charged in the deaths of 19 people during the nearly two decades that prosecutors say he was the head of the @entity24 mob in @entity0			1
@entity9 described a meeting between @entity6 and a man who owed him money			2
when the man balked at paying , @entity6 replied , " we have a business besides bookmaking			2
" " what 's that ? " the man asked			0
" killing ( expletive ) like you			0
" the 83 - year - old @entity6 , who has shown little emotion in the first days of trial , threw his head back and let out a laugh			2
at trial , @entity6 edscribed as ' hands - on killer ' @entity9 said he was an " independent " bookmaker , or unaffiliated with a crime organization , when @entity6 summoned him to a meeting to discuss joining the @entity42			2
@entity9 said had been working for the @entity44 mafia in @entity0 's @entity45 but @entity6 told him , " forget the @entity45			1
if you want to be in business , you have to be with us			0
" he had no choice but to join @entity6 's @entity51 gang , @entity9 testified , saying , " their reputation preceded them			1
" @entity9 then referenced @entity0 's violent gang wars saying , " a lot of people were shot			1
mr. @entity6 ended up on top			2
you can draw your own conclusions			0
" thus began a 14 - year relationship , with @entity9 testifying he paid @entity6 's group a couple of thousand dollars , cash , in " rent " virtually every month			1
asked why , @entity9 replied , " i valued my life as well as those with me			2
" the monthly payment went in excess of $ 2,000 , @entity9 said , and was sometimes higher because @entity6 and partner @entity69 would charge random " taxes " if , for example , one of @entity9 's workers found himself at the end of a government wiretap			1
@entity6 never personally took the money , which was always paid in cash			1
it was always handed to @entity6 's partner , @entity69			1
" maybe he never wanted it entered into evidence , " @entity9 offered			0
@entity9 said he moved to @entity15 in the early ' 90s , turning over the day - to - day operations of his bookmaking business to one of his six daughters			0
several years later , he said , he was summoned to a meeting with @entity69 amid rumblings that @entity6 associates -- including a " father - and - daughter team " -- were starting to cooperate with the government			1
he said before he left for the meeting he told his daughter , " if i 'm not back in 12 hours go to the @entity93 in @entity94			0
do n't go home ( to @entity0 )			2
do n't go to the @entity93 there			0
" @entity9 is expected to continue testifying monday			0
jurors earlier heard testimony from retired @entity99 col. @entity98 , who on thursday described the @entity93 's informant program as " poorly run			0
" " the @entity93 put a higher priority protecting their informants " than they did protecting " public safety , " @entity98 said			0
@entity6 's lawyers are trying to show @entity6 was allowed to act with impunity , sanctioned by corrupt @entity93 agents and federal prosecutors			1
on cross-examination @entity6 attorney @entity110 questioned @entity98 about the integrity of @entity6 's @entity93 informant file , which is likely to be introduced at trial , asking the retired investigator why he would accept the informant file as accurate when it was compiled by the same @entity93 agents @entity98 believed were lying to him			1
@entity98 said he had other sources but acknowledged he had never checked the validity of the entire file			0
@entity6 's lawyers also are trying to establish that @entity6 was never a paid informant for the @entity93 and that instead @entity6 was the one paying rogue agents for information			1
the trial is expected to take up to three months and has the potential to reveal sensational details about the mob and @entity93 corruption , especially if @entity6 chooses to testify			0
@entity6 was in hiding for 16 years before he was captured in @entity128 , @entity129 , two years ago , living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city			1
at his july 2011 arraignment , he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts .			0
