the twin brothers who lost their @entity1 show after a recording surfaced of one 's anti-homosexuality views are surprisingly not upset at the network that fired them			1
their beef is not with @entity1 , but with the gay " agenda " that " bullied " the network , @entity10 and @entity11 told @entity13 's " @entity12 " on friday			1
" i feel they got bullied , " @entity11 said			1
" there 's an agenda that 's out in @entity17 right now that demands silence , especially from men and women who profess @entity21 and hold to his standards			2
" their dismissal from the show they were scheduled to host added fuel to the debate over people losing their jobs for what they say about their personal lives			2
it 's not a free speech issue , as both sides mostly agree that people have the right to say what they want , but a question of how severe the consequences for unpopular positions should be			2
@entity1 was within its rights to let the @entity11 brothers go , but maybe it should n't have , @entity44 , a @entity45 columnist , told " @entity12			1
" " do they have a legal right ? yes			0
should we be cheering it ? no , we should not			0
we ought to be big enough people that we can see people we do n't agree with , let them fix their houses , help the nice people			0
what are we scared of ? " @entity44 said			0
the brothers ran afoul of the network after the site @entity59 published a post about the pair , labeling @entity11 as an " anti-gay , anti-choice extremist " for reportedly leading a prayer rally in 2012 outside of the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67			1
the site posted a recording of @entity11 talking to a talk show host about " homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation " and " demonic ideologies " taking hold in colleges and public schools			1
@entity11 also discusses the fight for @entity67 's @entity78 , which involved a ban on same - sex marriage and civil unions in the state constitution			1
the @entity11 brothers were the planned stars of the @entity1 show " @entity84 , " set to premiere in october , in which they would have helped families purchase homes they otherwise could not afford			1
" when the firestorm came in , we had an opportunity to speak with @entity91 and the folks over there and explain to them who we were as people , " @entity88 said			0
" we sell to all people of all kinds , and that we would be glad to take a homosexual couple onto our show			0
" @entity100 , a branding and social media consultant , told " @entity12 " that the decision probably boiled down to money			0
" this is @entity1 scared because they saw what happened with @entity113 , they saw what happened with " @entity115 , " and this is a ... move to make sure that this does n't come back to bite them , " he said , referring to the controversies for offensive comments made by the stars on their respective shows			1
" this is about money , " he said			0
" and if you are going to come out and say something that is against a big section of the population , love it or hate it , you 're going to not have that right to give that talk , to get that show , to do whatever			0
" the show 's producers knew about the brothers ' views and went ahead with them as hosts until the controversy went public , the @entity129 said			0
" we do n't feel wronged at all			0
this is n't @entity91 versus us , or us against the gay community			2
this is an agenda , and we 're getting to witness it right now , " @entity88 said			2
their comments have never been aimed at gays , but at an agenda that says you ca n't stand by your beliefs , @entity88 said			1
" it 's only going to get worse because there is an agenda that wants to silence the beliefs that we have , " he said .			2

@entity10 and @entity11 say they are not upset at @entity1
their *complaint* is with what they call a gay " agenda "
*cancellation* of " @entity161 about effects of airing personal beliefs
