-- author @entity1 believes that everyone has a little bit of @entity4 in them			1
even if you 're not a gay theater nerd with dreams of stardom , @entity1 thinks everyone has felt like an outsider at some point			2
he may be onto something with his @entity4 novels , about the semi-autobiographical teen character who chases @entity16 dreams to @entity17 for an open casting call in " @entity19 : the musical			1
" @entity1 's 2013 debut middle - grade novel , " better @entity22 , " struck a chord with critics and readers and was named one of 2013 's notable children 's books by the @entity29 and @entity30			1
its sequel " @entity35 , six , seven , @entity4 ! " comes out tuesday and was listed among the best books of january by @entity34			0
" five , @entity38 , seven , @entity4 ! " picks up where the first book left off			1
@entity1 , who was a @entity16 dancer and choreographer , takes readers further backstage with @entity4 as his @entity16 dreams begin to come true , but he has to do some growing up along the way			1
@entity1 says his aim was to write a novel he would have loved when he was younger and feeling left out			2
the real message is n't about @entity4 's love of @entity16 or his sexuality , @entity1 says , but about embracing whatever makes you unique			1
fast facts age : 33 hometown : @entity52 other titles : " better @entity22 " and " @entity54 , " a literary cocktail guide voted the top food and cookbook of 2013 on @entity58			0
fun facts : @entity1 appeared in the original @entity16 casts of " @entity61 " and " @entity62 " before coaching the child stars of the show " @entity65			2
" for fans of : @entity16 musicals and tv shows like " @entity69 , " " smash " and " @entity71			0
" five questions for @entity1 @entity0 : what 's happening with @entity4 in your new novel ? @entity1 : " five , six , seven , @entity4 ! " opens on my 13 - year - old protagonist packing up a duffel bag and bidding his @entity80 town goodbye , heading off to start rehearsals for his @entity17 debut in " @entity19 : the musical			1
" the book is an insider look at what happens when a big - budget @entity16 show comes together ( and occasionally apart ) , as seen through the eyes of a diehard theater nerd who just happens to also be a chocolate milk aficionado			0
think : " smash " with zits			0
@entity0 : how was writing the sequel different from your first book ? @entity1 : i wrote " better @entity22 " in total secret while working on the show " @entity65			1
" once the book came out and started getting a lot of unexpected attention , i felt like the " @entity103 writer " -- like a bit of a faker who was suddenly turned real			0
so the biggest difference in writing a sequel is that now there are expectations			0
but also , and this is the awesome part , now there are fans , too ! @entity0 : since " better @entity22 , " has the message changed or evolved in your new book ? @entity1 : the books are highly autobiographical , and i learned as a dancer that even when you get cast in a dream show , there are still setbacks and surprises ( and critics )			1
for @entity4 , he 's finally part of a tribe of people who truly " get " him in " five , six , seven , @entity4 ! " but now he 's dealing with cutthroat child stars and the nervous clamor of a brand - new town			0
if the message between books has evolved at all , it 's probably : " hold on to what makes you unique , but get ready to grow up a little , too			2
" @entity0 : you 've said before kids can be your toughest critics			0
what have you heard from them ? @entity1 : i 've received quite a few all - capped emails yelling at me for ending the first book on such a @entity145 ! ! ! ! ! also , several kids named @entity4 have written to say it 's " cool or whatever " to have their name in the title of a book			1
@entity0 : @entity4 's sexuality is important to the story but not the focus of your book			1
how did you decide to handle that and what kind of reaction have you received ? @entity1 : you ca n't tell the story of a 13 - year - old boy who knows every lyric to " @entity163 " without also referencing how much teasing he gets at school			0
believe me , i remember			0
middle school readers can handle a lot of truth , especially when it 's broached delicately , so the response to @entity4 's subtle maybe - he - is - maybe - he - is n't - gay subplot has been overwhelmingly positive -- with librarians and parents cheering on @entity4 's goofy perseverance in spite of how hard it can be just being a kid			2
i think every adult i know felt like an outsider in middle school , and these books are for anyone who might be going through that now and could use a laugh .			0

@entity1 's " five , @entity38 , seven , @entity4 ! " picks up where " better @entity22 " left off
@entity4 's @entity16 dreams are starting to come true , but it 's no *cakewalk*
the book 's message is to embrace whatever makes you unique , @entity1 says
