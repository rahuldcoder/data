@entity0 , @entity1 -- the judge that @entity4 wants to hear an estimated 200 lawsuits over the @entity7 oil disaster gets tens of thousands of dollars a year in oil royalties and is paid travel expenses to industry conferences , financial disclosure forms show			1
lawyers who practice before @entity14 district judge @entity13 say he 's tough but fair , and a @entity2 review of his cases found he ruled in favor of oil companies only slightly more often than he ruled against them			1
but his connections to the industry have raised eyebrows at a time when @entity4 is under fire for the worst oil spill in @entity14 history			1
federal financial disclosure forms obtained by @entity2 show that since 2003 , @entity13 has consistently been paid annual fees from the oil and gas industry , mostly in the form of lease payments for wells and mineral rights on land he owns			1
none of the payments comes from @entity4 , but his holdings include mutual funds that draw income from @entity41 , a minority owner in the well now pouring up to 2.5 million gallons a day into the @entity7			1
in some cases , the amounts are significant			0
in others , the payments are relatively small			0
oil giant @entity47 paid him between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 in 2008 , the last year in which records are publicly available			0
in a note attached to the 2008 form , @entity13 said he expected the amounts to be relatively similar for 2009			1
he gets smaller amounts from smaller producers such as @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , which pay for the right to drill oil and gas from lands he owns			0
the federal disclosure form does not require exact amounts , only estimates and approximate figures			0
a legal expert on ethics , @entity70 professor @entity68 , told @entity2 that judges with financial ties to the oil industry should make their connections crystal clear			1
" when you take it together , is there a concern that a reasonable person might say , ' look - it , he 's not a judge that happens to be dabbling -- he 's in effect a participant in the industry he 's trying to judge , ' " @entity68 said			2
@entity13 has been sitting on the federal bench in @entity0 since the mid- 1980s , and @entity4 has asked that he supervise all of the estimated 200 cases filed against it since the april sinking of the offshore drill rig @entity92			1
the sinking left 11 workers dead and uncorked a gusher that has been fouling the @entity7 for more than eight weeks			0
in court filings in early may , @entity4 requested @entity13 be assigned to preside over the spill lawsuits because he already was assigned to one of the first cases , a lawsuit filed on behalf of @entity102 - @entity14 fishermen from @entity103			1
according to an e-mail sent to @entity2 , @entity4 said the judge " is an appropriate choice to provide oversight of these cases			1
" the @entity109 has asked that the suits be consolidated in @entity111 , @entity103 , the closest federal court to the spill			0
the sinking took place in the waters off southeastern @entity103 , about 40 miles off the mouth of the @entity118			0
@entity4 would not comment on @entity13 ' financial disclosures			1
but the judge has held two recent meetings in @entity0 to discuss possible ethics concerns , a lawyer who attended those meetings told @entity2			1
" in both of those hearings , the questions have been raised about whether or not he should preside over these cases or whether there will be a conflict , " @entity125 , a prominent @entity0 plaintiff attorney , told @entity2			2
" in the second one , the judge explained he had listed online all of his financial disclosure information , so people would be able to look at and probe			2
" one particular case over which @entity13 presided in 2009 is raising questions			2
in 2008 , @entity13 listed royalty payments from about 10 wells leased to @entity141 , an @entity142 - based oil and gas company			1
the amounts were relatively small -- under $ 15,000 , according to his disclosure form -- and a source told @entity2 the payments were for a collection of nine or 10 wells scattered in land across two or three states			2
in may of 2009 , @entity13 issued a favorable decision for @entity141 in a dispute with its insurance company			2
according to an attorney for the insurance firm , the total amount was $ 3.9 million			0
court records show that @entity13 did not disclose his royalty payments from @entity159 at any point during the proceedings			2
no one claims the judge has violated the federal code of judicial ethics , but @entity68 says appearances matter			0
" i think the best practice that is out there , and i think what judges across the country are encouraged to do , is that if there is any doubt , put some sunshine on the problem , " he said			0
" turn your cards face up , to mix metaphors , and make it clear to the parties what your potential interests are			0
" @entity13 also travels widely and speaks to meetings held by the @entity184 , including one held in early june in the @entity186 city of @entity187 and an earlier conference in @entity189 , @entity190			2
he 's the association 's distinguished lecturer on ethics , having delivered 10 speeches to the trade group in the past three years			0
the association does n't pay him a fee but does supply his travel , accommodation and expenses , said @entity200 , a spokesman for the trade group			0
federal judges rarely respond to requests for comment from journalists			0
but @entity13 told @entity2 in an e-mail that while he could n't speak to past or present cases , he did quote @entity208 : " let facts be submitted to a candid world , " he wrote			1
lawyers who know him call @entity13 a tough but fair judge and say the reference is to a desire for transparency on his part			1
but attorneys for environmental advocacy groups say that for @entity4 to request @entity13 be assigned to the spill lawsuits is " outrageous and unseemly			1
" @entity2 examined three years of @entity13 ' rulings on oil and gas cases , finding he ruled in favor of oil companies only slightly more often than ruling against them			1
as for other federal judges , a recent survey showed more than 20 federal judges across the @entity230 have a financial interest in oil and gas companies			0
several of them have recused themselves from presiding over cases related to the @entity7 spill			0
