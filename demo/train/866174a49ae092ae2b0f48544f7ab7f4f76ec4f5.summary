-- the daughter of the rev. @entity2 said thursday that her brothers wo n't take @entity2 's @entity4 and traveling @entity5 from her without a fight			1
@entity7 alleges her brothers @entity8 and @entity10 want to sell the objects , and she told reporters that she wo n't stand by to let it happen			1
the slain civil rights icon 's estate -- controlled by his sons -- filed a complaint in @entity18 in @entity19 last week to force @entity7 to turn over the items			1
" not on my watch , " she said at @entity19 's @entity21 , where her father preached			1
and to anyone who would shake their head at yet another court battle between the @entity2 siblings , @entity7 has a message : " i would appreciate it if you would refrain from grouping me with my brothers , " she said			1
" they are my brothers , and i do love them			2
but we are different people , different perspective and different positions			0
and that should be respected			0
" the complaint filed friday says that @entity2 's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the estate of @entity2 , but that @entity7 has " secreted and sequestered " the items in question			1
the estate wants the civil rights leader 's @entity46 and his traveling @entity5 , which was used by president @entity47 when he was sworn in for his second term			1
@entity7 said thursday that her brothers told her on january 20 that they wanted the items so they could sell them			1
the complaint does not mention the possibility of a sale , and @entity0 's attempts to contact the @entity2 brothers have been unsuccessful			1
" i stand here in ( my father 's ) stead as biological and spiritual heir to say these items should never be sold to any person ... or any institution , because they are sacred , " she said			2
" we have no right to sell our birthright , nor the birthright of ( past and future ) generations , " she said			2
before @entity47 used it during his second inauguration , the @entity5 was on display at @entity21 in @entity19 , @entity7 told @entity0 thursday			2
she is the center 's ceo			0
she said she hopes to display it again , but for now is keeping it and the @entity74 in a location she is n't disclosing			0
her fight , she said , is not motivated by sibling rivalry , but by principal			0
and she said she hopes she and her brothers can reconcile			0
when a reporter asked where this would end , she answered : " that 's the same question i ask @entity83 every day			0
" this is not the first time the family has been at odds over @entity2 's legacy			0
over the years , the siblings have sued and counter-sued one another			2
@entity7 and @entity10 sued @entity8 in 2008 , accusing him of converting " substantial funds from the estate 's financial account at @entity95 " for his own use			1
they later agreed to a settlement and avoided a public trial			0
@entity0 's @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 contributed to this report .			0
