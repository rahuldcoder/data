@entity0 -- a @entity3 holy man castrated himself in @entity4 wednesday following the arrest of popular preacher @entity6 , revered by millions across the country for his sermons on enlightenment			1
police have charged the 72 - year old guru with raping a 16 - year - old schoolgirl at one of his ashrams , or religious centers , in august			1
authorities in the northern @entity4 state of @entity20 found @entity21 , a 60 - year old follower of @entity22 , bleeding at his home in @entity24 from apparently self - inflicted wounds , city police chief @entity17 told @entity1			1
@entity21 was admitted to a local hospital and then taken to a bigger health facility for surgery where his condition " is stable " , said @entity17			2
asked whether his act was related to the arrest of @entity6 , @entity17 added , " we have heard such things , but all this is unconfirmed			2
" " some say it was because of @entity6 's arrest , " said @entity17 to @entity34 earlier , " some say it was because he feared ending up in @entity22 's situation			1
" @entity6 has denied the sexual assault allegations leveled by the teenage girl and her parents , both devotees of the guru			1
the elderly preacher has also claimed he is physically incapable of rape but police say medical tests show him to be in good shape			0
" the team of doctors is saying he is perfectly , medically , mentally and physically fit , " said @entity51 , deputy commissioner of police in @entity52			0
@entity6 , also referred to as the " godman " in local @entity4 media , is currently in jail awaiting trial after a court rejected his bail plea earlier this week , public prosecutor @entity55 told @entity1			1
the prosecution plans to present a detailed dossier of the charges in the trial soon , he said			0
this month 's unfolding rape case against @entity6 is just the latest in a series of sexual assault incidents in @entity4 since late 2012 that have gained high - profile attention both for their frequency and ferocity			1
it was the gang rape and murder of a 23 - year - old student in @entity76 last december that galvanized @entity4 society and the media in particular , to examine the pervasive incidence of rape and other forms of violence against women			1
the barbarity of the crime ignited a wide - ranging discussion across all levels of the @entity4 media and prompted multiple debates in the national and regional assemblies			1
stung into action by public outrage , the government instituted new laws and crucially stricter punishments , which includes the death penalty when victims are killed or left in a vegetative state			0
furthermore in a sharp departure with previous practice , predatory behavior such as voyeurism , stalking and groping can now lead to arrest and punishment			0
@entity4 's court system is now making greater use of fast - track trials to prosecute the most heinous and high - profile crimes against women			2
local and national media have maintained their spotlight on sexual assaults and other violence against women , leading to a torrent of disturbing reports following last december 's horrific rape incident			2
in march , at least five men from a local tribe gang - raped a @entity121 woman camping with her husband in a forest in @entity4 's @entity126 district			2
a court convicted six men to life in prison four months later			0
in april , a 4 - year - old @entity4 girl was raped by a 35 - year - old man in @entity4 's central @entity134 state			1
the girl suffered brain damage and was in a coma for two weeks before dying from cardiac arrest			0
and in june , at least three men gang - raped a 31 - year - old @entity141 tourist in northern @entity4 after she visited the @entity142 after midnight			1
she accepted a ride from the group after failing to find a taxi			0
they drove her to a wooded area where they assaulted her			0
while such incidents have been covered extensively by international news media , an even larger number of cases are only reported in domestic @entity4 news outlets -- and an unknown number simply go unreported			2
just this week in local media , the @entity156 reported two men gang - raped a 27 - year - old woman who had gone to a local dairy in northern @entity20 state , the @entity155 reported at least six to seven girls were lured to and raped at a deserted steel mill south of @entity164 over the past half year , and the @entity165 reported the story of a 14 - year - old girl who was allegedly raped by two people over several months in western @entity170 state			1
villagers discovered the girl was pregnant but later miscarried twin babies			0
according to @entity4 's @entity175 , the country recorded 24,923 cases of reported rape in 2012 -- a 57 % rise in reported cases since 2003			2
this number is widely considered to be extremely underreported for a country of more than 1 billion people			0
the @entity141 , with a population of more than 310 million , recorded 270,000 cases of rape in 2010 , the most recent year for which national rape statistics are available			0
