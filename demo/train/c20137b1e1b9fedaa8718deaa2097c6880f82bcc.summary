-- when it comes to the new " @entity3 " movie , critics have found one begrudging silver lining : at least it 's better than " @entity7			1
" of course the live - action " @entity13 , " in theaters friday , has some things in common with that toy - based franchise , beginning with its association with @entity12			1
the " @entity7 " director served as a producer on 2014 's " turtles " adaptation -- leaving the directing to @entity20 of " @entity21 " -- and tapped former " transformers " star @entity23 to go along for the ride			1
in " turtles , " @entity24 plays @entity26 , the eager @entity27 reporter who stumbles across the titular crew of teenage mutants who are well - versed in the martial arts			0
as april learns , this quad of wise - cracking reptiles , who have a fondness for pizza and a rat for a mentor , are the result of a lab experiment			0
so there 's the first sigh of relief for longtime fans of " turtle power " : the new " turtles " backstory is pretty faithful to the legacy of the comics , animated series and movies that came before it			2
there 's a tweak involving april 's childhood relationship to the turtles , but , overall , @entity56 's still the brainy one ; @entity57 's still the hothead ; @entity59 's still the leader ; and @entity60 is as party - ready as ever			2
the problem , critics say , is n't that @entity12 , @entity20 and script writers @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 did n't respect the lore , or that the movie does n't deliver on action			1
it 's that they revived the franchise with no sense of humor or affection , or even a clear understanding of their audience			2
" the new adaptation , " says the @entity83 , " often feels like some sort of corporate seminar in brand management			0
there is something half - hearted about the entire film , as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it , not because they should make it , but just because they could			0
" it 's not " out - and - out terrible , " but it 's not " particularly memorable , " either			0
@entity95 wound up in the same place of ambivalence , remarking in its review that " @entity3 " is a " back - to - basics origin saga that is neither a particularly good movie nor the pop culture travesty that some were dreading			0
" there are all the usual @entity105 trademarks -- " chaotic action , crass side jokes , visual - effects overkill , @entity23 " -- but on the other hand , it 's also " nowhere near ' transformers ' - level off - putting , " @entity95 shrugs			1
for the @entity113 , it is n't " fidelity " the movie lacks , " but a spirit of genuine boyish fun ...			1
' @entity117 ' exists for the sole purpose of squeezing a few more drops of milk out of an old cash cow			0
at least the @entity117 themselves look cool , strange new nostrils and all			0
" but according to the @entity126 , those turtles -- whether you find them to be cool or simply creepy -- do n't get nearly enough screen time , and are treated more like " sidekicks to the actual focus of this film : summer - movie sexpot @entity23			2
" @entity132 , which found the movie " charmless , dull and derivative , " joined the party line and conceded that " while there 's nothing particularly playful , fun or clever about this big - screen ' turtles ' re-boot , there is some good news ... the ninja turtles are more enjoyable to watch than ' transformers			1

the new " @entity13 " is n't getting great reviews
the movie is n't *horrible* , but it is n't great , either
at least , reviewers say , it 's better than " transformers "
