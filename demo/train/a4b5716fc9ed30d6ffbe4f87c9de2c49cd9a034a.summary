@entity0 -- it was a confident decision and it paid off			1
the @entity3 could have chosen other cities for her first solo overseas tour , but she chose @entity0 , a city closely -- and tragically -- associated with @entity6 , the first wife of prince @entity7			1
but @entity8 came here despite that , not because of it			2
this is more about @entity8 's long - term rehabilitation from being " the other woman " to queen - in - waiting and the strategy is working			2
@entity6 may have been a fashion icon who famously championed @entity19 handbags , but @entity8 did n't shy away from accepting an invitation to @entity19 in @entity0 in her own right			1
a @entity23 spokeswoman told me the duchess was , " delighted to accept as she was keen to highlight the wonderful skill and craftsmanship involved in this renowned french fashion house			0
" and i saw her clearly fascinated by the intricacy of the work being done in the couture workshop on the top floor			0
@entity8 , unlike @entity6 , is n't defined particularly by fashion			1
she 's more about country living and was in her element watching an equine display by the @entity38 in @entity0			2
she went behind the scenes to meet the horses and speak to the farrier making their shoes			0
she 's a hands - on duchess , unafraid of getting her hands dirty			0
she 's as comfortable with a farrier as she is with presidents and prime ministers			0
she is something of a social chameleon , able to move between easily different groups with ease , including the press pack			2
in a typical @entity8 moment , she arrived @entity0 with a smile and greeted the media with a big hello , then went on to admit nerves			1
@entity8 's common touch came out during an unannounced visit to a street market			1
a butcher asked her to try a sample			0
she of course obliged and he was struck about how nice she was : " very agreeable , bearing in mind her status , " he told me			0
at another stall , she bought five dresses for a grand - daughters from a trader who described the duchess as polite and said she " loved everything			0
" a royal source in the past described to me how the duchess is a " professional grandmother			0
" there 's more to the @entity3 than you see : invariably she manages to win people round when she comes face to face with them , despite the @entity6 back - story we all know so well			1
we will be getting more insight into her character as she takes on more official duties			0
the queen is cutting back on her travel and prince @entity7 with @entity8 are increasingly being asked to represent the monarchy , which will one day be theirs			1
we 're being given in a sense @entity8 , queen - in - waiting , not just prince @entity7 's wife .			1

the @entity3 began her first solo overseas tour in @entity0 on may *28*
the @entity94 *capital* is closely associated with @entity6 , the first wife of @entity7
@entity8 shows a common touch and moved comfortably between different groups
