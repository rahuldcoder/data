@entity0 , @entity1 -- from bakery to barber shop , cafe to carpet store , @entity1 stroll their capital with a renewed step , uplifted by how their newly elected president seeks something remarkable after decades of cold war - like relations between their country and the @entity13			1
with everyone who 's been skeptical of the country			1
and @entity1 is willing to discuss its nuclear program , president @entity19 says			1
" i just feel it			1
it 's not like i 've seen anything , but i feel it , " said retiree @entity22			1
" it 's the best thing to do			1
we 've been hurting ourselves for years			1
" international economic sanctions against @entity1 have strained day - to - day living in @entity1 , making essential goods such as medicine expensive and hard to come by			1
that punishment has taken a toll			2
" the sanctions have hurt us			2
there are things you ca n't find , " said @entity36 at the @entity37			2
to many @entity1 , @entity19 seems to be really advancing the " hope and prudence " slogan he used during his successful campaign to become president in june , posturing as a centrist and reformer against hardline conservatives that characterized previous president @entity51			1
@entity19 had been @entity1 's national security council chief and its lead nuclear negotiator			1
" with mr. @entity19 here , we 've become more hopeful that things will improve , " @entity36 said			1
@entity56 , 28 , is a part of the young generation to whom @entity19 appealed in his stump speeches			2
@entity61 dislikes political isolation and applauds diplomacy			2
" everything is solved through friendship			2
war and sanctions and conflict never solve anything , " @entity56 said			2
one day , @entity14 and @entity1 president might shake hands a new sense of optimism without doubt , the long years of hostility between @entity1 and the @entity14 leave many @entity1 wary and distrustful of @entity77 countries			1
those feelings endure and were captured by an open microphone that @entity2 set up wednesday on a busy street in @entity81 , inviting passers - by to send a personal sound bite around the world			1
" i say hello to all @entity14 , " said one woman named @entity86			2
" your behavior is not very good			0
your politics is about war and it 's terrifying ...			1
do n't create so many restrictions for us			0
do n't impose on us so many sanctions			0
" in general , however , there 's a whiff of euphoria for the first time in many people 's memory			2
that was also expressed at the open mike			2
" @entity14 is a great county and we want to have good relations with @entity14 , and our government is working to make that happen , " said @entity104 , who did n't give her last name			0
" we hope @entity14 politicians understand the circumstances , and through positive talks we can thaw this relationship that has been frozen for 35 years , so we can live @entity114 as friends			0
" a @entity0 - based author and political analyst also sensed change in the air			1
" so far he has done more than we expected , " @entity120 said about the new president			2
" ever since the elections , there is a mood of optimism			0
there is a mood of hope			0
wherever you go in @entity1 , you can see people happier			1
" @entity120 went so far as to say @entity1 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity132 , also has altered his rhetoric , joining the prevailing hopefulness			1
" i can not fail to detect some changes with regard to the attitude of the supreme leader ever since the elections , " @entity120 said			0
wherever @entity1 gathered and did business , they spoke to how new ground was being broken -- and whether they believed it was for real			1
at a carpet store , @entity144 , 50 , believed a new day was dawning			0
" he 's the hope of the future of @entity1 , especially the way he 's talking to the world and especially to @entity14 , " @entity144 said of the new president			1
" we believe the two nations -- @entity1 and @entity14 -- they believe they need each other and like each other			1
they feel it 's the right time to get together and start talking at least			1
" one mother , however , did n't endorse that sentiment			0
she is going to press ahead with her efforts to leave @entity1			1
if there 's a better future for her and her son , it 's outside @entity1 , she said			1
" in my view , i do n't think you can get anywhere here in @entity1 , " said the mother , @entity167 , who declined to give her last name			1
" i have n't lost hope			0
i just do n't think anything has changed			0
i 'm just not that optimistic			0
" her son , @entity175 , did n't like her mother 's plan to leave			2
" i want to stay , " he said			0
" my friends are here			0
" @entity19 calls for ' constructive ' dialogue , end to ' unhealthy ' rivalries wishing for an easier life at the open microphone , several speakers did n't need prompting to broach perhaps the biggest subject on the international community 's mind -- whether @entity1 is building nuclear weapons			1
@entity1 says its controversial atomic program is for peaceful energy purposes			1
but several @entity77 countries want @entity1 to fully comply with a @entity193 agency 's inspectors looking into whether the nuclear development is to build a bomb			1
" hi , @entity14 , " said one man named @entity197			0
" as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't think they 're making bombs			0
" then , he added , " with all the sanctions they put on us , it 's like putting a gun on someone 's head			2
" you respect our civil rights and we 'll respect yours			0
it 's just humanity , " he concluded			2
@entity212 has been a barber for 30 years and has three kids			0
he wants affordable medicine for his family			0
" there 's been a lot of tough times and rising costs , " @entity212 said			2
" one hundred percent , i want to see better relations , so we can live a little easier			0
" i 'm hopeful that change will happen so we can escape all the worry , " he added			0
those who held contrary opinions were equally effusive			0
" i do n't have hope because i do n't think @entity19 is everything in @entity1			1
he still has someone over the top of him , " said @entity228 at a newspaper stand			0
that superior is the ayatollah			0
a coffee shop owner agreed			0
" the final decider is the supreme leader			0
maybe if things change , then he 'll change his mind			0
so in the end , i 'm not optimistic , " proprietor @entity241 , who declined to give his last name			0
" we just want to live in peace			0
that 's my only wish -- to live in peace			2
" perhaps the most commonly shared view on @entity0 streets was rejection of how @entity77 leaders harshly characterize the country			1
" i know they call us terrorists , but you show me which one of us is terrorists ? " @entity228 said at the newsstand			0
" @entity1 are ( hospitable ) and kind and honest			1
" @entity19 brings ' charm offensive ' to @entity193 @entity2 's @entity259 contributed to this report from @entity0			1
