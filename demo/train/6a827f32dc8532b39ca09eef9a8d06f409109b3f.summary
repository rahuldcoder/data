@entity0 -- @entity3 's prime minister , @entity2 , may not seem a natural performer but he appears all too familiar with the waltz ; a typically slow dance , usually partnered , often mournful , with little room for improvement			1
as his country faces the prospect of a bailout , @entity2 's gentle glides may mark him as a natural on the political dance floor			1
but to others , his moves are far too predictable			0
in recent weeks , @entity2 has measured his steps carefully			1
he has been balancing political tactics with the need to stabilize the economy			1
he wants to avoid the fate of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , which have been left at the mercy of foreign creditors			0
gliding sideways but his steps are being read like an open book			0
@entity3 no longer believe he can keep up the tempo			2
media speculation is centered on a @entity32 summit on october 18 and 19 , and the potential for @entity2 to seek a bailout at that time			1
but this gloomy conservative has built a career on digging in his heels , and some suggest @entity2 will wait until after regional elections in the @entity42 country and in his home state of @entity44 on october 21 before asking for any help			1
it 's all tactics of course			2
by withholding unpopular news until after the election , @entity2 may have a better chance of winning a full majority in the local parliament			2
but playing politics with the budget may not be a good idea			0
@entity2 delayed announcing the 2012 budget in march until after a regional ballot in @entity59 -- the @entity3 region with the highest unemployment in the country at 32.8 % -- but the move did not pay off			1
his center - right party , @entity65 , failed to oust the @entity66			0
in harmony with the partner @entity2 's political moves have , to a certain extent , been in harmony with the @entity72			1
the @entity72 this month outlined its plan to save the euro by offering to make unlimited purchases of short - term government bonds			0
the announcement eased pressure on @entity3 -- and @entity2 -- and the country 's borrowing costs fell			1
last week , @entity2 had yet another reason to continue his slow dance			1
the @entity83 sold $ 6.3 billion of three - year and 10 - year government bonds , more that it had planned			0
but , despite the optimism , some suggest @entity2 should request aid now , when market conditions are more favorable			2
delays in acknowledging @entity3 needs a support package may be more costly for it in the long run			2
according to @entity94 , managing director of @entity95 , there 's a " surreal air " to @entity3 debt auctions			2
@entity94 , in a note , wrote the bond sales are well received because investors are pricing in an eventual request from @entity102 for an @entity72 - backed bond - buying program			0
staying steady @entity2 has often said he sees little point in asking for aid			0
this month , in his first tv interview since being elected , he said he will not accept outside conditions over a possible bailout			0
speaking to @entity3 's national broadcaster @entity109 , @entity2 said : " we have to study any conditions imposed on the bailout package and then we will see			1
but of course , i would not like it if they told us where we had to cut or where not			0
" @entity3 taking to the streets in protest do n't care about the politics as long as they can get a job , pay their mortgage and eat			0
only a week ago , tens of thousands of demonstrators from across @entity3 took to the streets of @entity102 in a large anti-austerity protest			0
the last dance ? meanwhile , on the streets of @entity128 , @entity2 faces a domestic challenge that could make seeking a bailout even more complicated			1
last week , @entity2 rejected @entity132 's demand for greater economic independence			2
as the most economically powerful region , @entity132 argues it can do without @entity102			0
fears of separatism are so acute that @entity3 's @entity137 -- in an unusual move -- has spoken out			1
the king released an open letter on the @entity142 's website calling for national unity and lamenting the country 's economic pain			0
" the worst thing we can do is to divide our forces , encourage dissension , chase illusions , deepen wounds , " the king wrote			0
many believe @entity2 will continue his slow dance despite the political discord			1
but it seems , no matter the delays , @entity3 is slowly stepping toward a bailout			2
as such , this could be @entity2 's last political dance .			1

@entity3 's prime minister , @entity2 , may not seem a natural performer but he appears all too familiar with the waltz
as his country faces the prospect of a bailout , @entity2 's gentle glides may mark him as a natural on political dance floor
@entity2 has been measuring his steps carefully , balancing political tactics with the need to stabilize the economy
but there are complicating *factors* in this slow dance toward a possible bailout
