-- president @entity1 said he is not seeking " regime change " in @entity3			1
military action in @entity3 , he said this weekend as he sought congressional approval , will be limited			2
these assurances are meant to reassure those who fear a repeat of @entity9			0
but the idea of a limited intervention is an illusion			0
once the @entity14 becomes directly involved in @entity3 , there can be no turning back			1
the purpose of limited strikes would be to convey a message to @entity19 : do n't use chemical weapons			1
but a @entity14 attack could potentially widen , rather than halt , the use of chemical weapons in @entity3			1
@entity3 , as a united entity , exists today only on the map			0
on the ground , competing interests have fractured the country			0
no party can claim to represent even a modest plurality of @entity3 , and no power can claim authority over a majority of the territory			0
but a formidable @entity36 state exists in @entity37 , and the numerous forces striving to seize it or bring about its demise are so hopelessly riven internally that they can not possibly win without external support			0
for more than two years now , they have attempted to incite @entity44 intervention by exhibiting evidence of the @entity19 government 's brutality			2
is it ' @entity49 ' for @entity1 on @entity3 ? by intervening now to inflict limited punishment on @entity19 because chemical weapons have been used , the @entity14 is erecting a precedent that could be exploited in the future by the more unscrupulous factions of the opposition looking to provoke further interventions			1
the knowledge that @entity58 will intervene if chemical weapons are used could create an incentive for their re-use by those who would benefit from such an intervention			1
by seemingly spurning meticulous multilateral investigations led by the @entity65 in a rush to fix the blame on @entity19 , the @entity14 is signaling also that , in its opinion , only the regime is capable of carrying out large - scale chemical attacks			1
this template will produce deadly temptations			0
as the novelist @entity74 , who spent long years studying insurgencies in @entity76 , has observed , in civil conflicts " the very prospect of intervention " often becomes a stimulus for the " the escalation of violence " by the weaker side			0
if limited use of chemical weapons can succeed in drawing the @entity14 into the conflict in a way that 100,000 deaths by conventional arms could not , they could be viewed by @entity19 's adversaries -- particularly by the foreign fighters affiliated with @entity93 -- as a blessing rather than a scourge			1
the effort to " liberate " @entity3 could become dependent for its success on the partial annihilation of @entity3 with chemical weapons -- since they are the only agents of murder that can trigger a @entity14 reaction			1
we can not be certain about the security of the chemical weapon stockpiles in the @entity3 government 's custody			1
its power structure has so far remained largely intact , but , as last year 's suicide bombing in @entity37 that killed @entity19 's inner circle and maimed his brother demonstrated , the regime is not impregnable			2
@entity3 vote could have consequences for 2016 in a land shattered by war , loyalties are constantly shifting and obtaining fatal nerve agents may not be tremendously difficult			0
in 1995 , for example , an obscure @entity121 cult called @entity123 managed to kill 13 passengers on the @entity126 subway by releasing sarin gas developed from commercially available chemicals			0
so what will the @entity14 do the next time chemical weapons are used in @entity3 ? more than 1,000 deaths are prompting the @entity14 -- despite the absence of conclusive evidence linking the @entity19 regime to the crime -- to intervene			1
can it refuse to live up to its own precedent if 10,000 @entity3 were killed in a fresh massacre after @entity1 's " limited " intervention has concluded ? wo n't the voices that are now so stridently opposing patient investigations and diplomacy in favor of military action amplify their demands ? but a deeper military involvement will be so self - wounding as to be suicidal			2
@entity3 has become a catchment for foreign fighters from more than 60 countries			0
their ambition is not simply to defeat @entity19			0
it is to establish a theocratic state in the most resolutely secular corner of the @entity36 world			0
it is the rise of these jihadists that has compelled @entity3 's secularists and religious minorities , who at the beginning of the uprising in 2011 had marched alongside the opposition , to return to @entity19 's fold			1
to rid @entity3 of @entity19 's dictatorship and prevent it from falling into the hands of jihadists who are cut from the same ideological cloth as the men who drove the planes into the @entity172 on september 11 , 2001 , the @entity14 may have to commit itself to @entity3 for more than a decade -- fighting the jihadists , subduing @entity19 and his allies in @entity174 , protecting @entity175 and preserving @entity177 's fragile peace			1
after @entity178 and @entity9 , is there an appetite for such an enterprise anywhere ? military has concerns about @entity3 mission intervening in @entity3 will perhaps pacify @entity1 's conscience			2
but in @entity3 , there 's every chance that it will escalate the conflict			2
ultimately tantalizing the losing side in the @entity3 civil war with a brief , punitive , " limited " entry on its behalf will only hasten the creation of conditions that will eventually suck @entity14 back into the conflict			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : if @entity14 engages in @entity3 over chemical weapons , it could be in for the long haul
he says rebels -- now *including* jihadists -- have long tried to draw outside forces to cause
he says opposition will know that use of chemical weapons works to its advantage
@entity197 : @entity14 could end up fighting @entity3 's jihadists and the @entity19 regime
