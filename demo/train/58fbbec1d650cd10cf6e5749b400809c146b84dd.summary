how could it happen here ? this is the question plaguing residents of @entity4 , @entity5 , a picture - perfect country town with good schools , quiet streets and a strong sense of community			1
but small towns like @entity4 are where 60 % of rampage school shootings in the @entity12 occur			1
far from big urban centers where gun violence is common , these communities are generally very safe			2
but more often than not , they are the places where this kind of tragedy strikes			2
my research team spent two years trying to understand rampage school shootings			1
we spent several months in @entity23 and @entity24 , in two towns that had been the scenes of shootings in the late 1990 's			1
we interviewed the shooters ' neighbors , friends , instructors , coaches and sunday school teachers			1
we talked to people who had observed the shooters in jail cells right after the shootings , and years later in prison			1
we combed the records of every shooting of this kind in the @entity12 from the 1970s onward , looking for patterns			1
and while each tragedy has its own anatomy , a picture emerged that makes sociological sense and probably has some bearing on the @entity4 case			2
opinion : put reason back in @entity12 's gun debate rampage shootings are never spontaneous			1
they are planned , often for months in advance			1
we do n't know yet whether the @entity4 shooter , @entity58 , gave any warnings , but in the episodes we studied , shooters commonly told their peers -- often in a veiled and ambiguous fashion -- what they had in mind			1
one reason shooters tip their hands is that they are trying to solve a problem			2
though they are often intelligent , high - performing boys , their peers tend to see them as unattractive losers , weak and unmanly			1
in a school culture that values sports prowess over academic accomplishment , they face rejection			1
the shooters are rarely loners , but tend instead to be failed joiners , and their daily social experience is full of friction			2
since they are almost always mentally or emotionally ill , those rejections -- so common in adolescence -- take on greater importance and become a fixation			2
rebuffed after trying to join friendship groups , they look for ways to gain attention , to reverse their damaged identities			1
the shooting is the last act in a long drama : a search for acceptance and recognition			1
the earlier acts fail miserably			2
but once a shooter starts to talk about killing people , ostracism can turn to inclusion			2
suddenly , he is getting the attention he has been craving			1
@entity102 , who killed three high school girls and paralyzed a fourth when he was a freshman in a @entity23 high school , pulled pranks , told loud silly jokes and stole @entity108 's in an attempt to impress			1
but the day he started talking about shooting people , that began to change			2
the @entity115 he desperately wanted to join wheeled in his direction for the first time			2
@entity118 never thought about how his actions would destroy lives or send his neighbors into a lifetime of angry mourning			2
interviewed after the shooting , he said he thought that those boys would at last become his friends			0
he would be asked over to their houses and they would visit him			0
he was a skinny 13 - year - old with glasses , a bright boy fond of reading and terrible at football -- all he was after was another identity			0
opinion : mourn ... and take action on guns look at photos of @entity140 , the shooter at @entity142 who murdered 32 people , and you will see eerie echoes of what @entity58 reportedly wore : mask , military fatigues , multiple guns in assault position			0
many of these young men are trying to cast themselves as stars of a movie that ends in a blaze of suicidal gunfire and notoriety			0
our research on earlier shootings showed the attack is on a school because that is the center stage in a small town , where the young men can rivet the entire community if so many clues are out there , why do n't more people see them ? high - school teachers see students less than an hour a day , and rarely compare notes with other teachers , even after witnessing troubling behavior			1
they often do not document infractions , preferring to address problems in their own classrooms			0
peers , on the other hand , do hear things			1
why do n't they come forward ? opinion : parents ' promise : i will keep you safe first , the signal is noisy			0
@entity102 was always saying goofy things			0
he explained to his would - be friends that they would see who " lived or died on monday			0
" @entity191 , who , together with @entity192 , killed four kids and a teacher in an @entity24 middle school , told his friends that he would be " running from the cops			1
" they recognized in hindsight that he was telegraphing his intentions			0
but at the time , most did n't know what to make of these comments			0
a few students took @entity102 's warnings so seriously that they did n't go to school that fateful monday			1
but none of the dozens of kids in either school who heard veiled threats reported them to adults			1
they did n't know how to interpret the signals			0
in the context of goofball comments they were used to , how could they know these were real warnings ? crossing the @entity216 that separates kids from adults in early adolescence is socially dangerous			1
why risk being deemed a tattletale or teacher 's pet when you do n't know whether those crazy asides actually mean anything ? this quandary is the root of preventing rampage shootings in schools			1
law enforcement will never be able to respond fast enough to stop shootings that often end in seconds			1
this is why we have to find ways for people who hear troubling rumors or threats to report them to people who can investigate and intervene			0
and while we do not know enough now to tell whether anyone had a clue about @entity58 's murderous intentions , it will not come as a shock if it turns out there were people in his social orbit who had an inkling , fuzzy and incredible as that inkling might be			0
it would fit the pattern of what we saw in virtually all of the other rampage shootings in @entity12 schools			1
opinion : has life in @entity12 gone insane ? would gun control help ? yes and no. yes , because anything that thwarts the efforts of a @entity262 or a @entity191 to get their hands on guns will make it harder to perpetrate a massacre and will deter the ambivalent			1
if @entity58 had had to go to greater lengths to get his hands on weapons , he might have run out of psychic energy to do this terrible deed			0
it appears he had little trouble , though , because the guns belonged to his mother , were registered and legally owned			0
why in the world we enable civilians to own such lethal instruments baffles millions of citizens and will be the subject of a searching debate if our politicians can get over the barriers that have prevented serious reform			0
but gun control is not enough			0
a determined person will find a way			0
@entity192 and @entity191 took a blow torch to a safe to try to get at the guns they knew were hidden there			0
that failed , so they found wire clippers and managed to cut their way through the cables that were supposed to keep @entity192 's grandfather 's gun collection out of the wrong hands			0
people who are this intent on getting their hands on weapons are very difficult to stop			0
that is not an argument against gun control because thousands of unbalanced young men are not quite that determined ; they are ambivalent			0
that is why gun control is a necessary but not sufficient step			0
although we will not be able to stop all of these tragedies , we can cut down on their number by insuring that adults make themselves available to kids in completely confidential settings , reassuring them of their privacy when they take that risky step to come forward			1
we can provide opportunities for " round pegs " like @entity102 , a bright , intellectually inclined kid , to find a social space that does n't depend on athletic prowess or a handsome face			2
if the reports of his childhood acquaintances prove to be correct , @entity58 may have been through a similar experience			0
kids can be very cruel and they are not always courageous enough to own up to their culpability for ostracism , particularly since they do n't know -- and can not be held responsible -- for the extreme consequences of emotional damage they may be causing			0
in the end , though , there will be troubled boys and some of them will become killers			0
to the extent that we can capture the warning signals they send out to their peers , we can do our best to stop them in their tracks , even if we do not always succeed			2

@entity351 : *bucolic* country towns are locus for most school shootings in @entity12
she says her research shows patterns in such shootings ; they are often planned far in advance
she says attackers often hint at plans ; they long to fit in , gain peers ' attention acceptance
@entity367 : we must provide settings for children to confide in adults
