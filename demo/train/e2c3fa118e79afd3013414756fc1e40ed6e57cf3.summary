@entity0 had it all : beauty -- she was a former model -- intelligence and business savvy			1
she also modeled herself on her idol , @entity6 , and was emerging as a successful businesswoman			0
" she was hardworking , loving , industrious and beautiful , " said her mother , @entity8			0
" she had achieved so much at age 24			0
" on july 21 this year , @entity0 traveled to @entity11 from the country 's capital @entity14 , ostensibly , to meet with retailers whom she thought might be able to offer her better prices on clothes and accessories for her fashion boutique			1
after landing , she called her mother to tell her that she had arrived safely			0
but @entity0 never made it to the meetings because there were n't any			2
she was found strangled to death in her hotel room the next morning			0
the trip was organized by @entity28 -- a man , police say , she met through the blackberry messenger service and @entity32			0
for months , he and @entity0 had chatted through these social media platforms and soon she had also " friended " his cousin , @entity34			1
police say @entity28 told @entity0 that he was a student at @entity35 but that he had connections and could help her with her fashion business			1
what @entity0 did n't know was that @entity28 had been stalking her for months , patiently gaining her confidence through frequent chats and postings			2
eventually , @entity28 made @entity0 an offer that seemed too good to be true			2
he offered to buy her a plane ticket and to put her up in a nice hotel if she would come to @entity11 to meet with his business associates			1
when @entity0 arrived in @entity11 , she was taken to a hotel just outside of town , drugged , beaten , sexually assaulted and finally , murdered , according to police			1

they assumed that she would come to @entity11 with cash , a large bank account and jewelry			1
" she got involved with the murderers while chatting , " says @entity11 police commissioner @entity62			1
" at some point they discovered that she came from a very good home and felt that they could make some quick money out of her			0
" but her brother , @entity69 , says that @entity0 never carried any large sums of cash			1
" she does n't even have an atm card , she used a checkbook , " he said			0
@entity0 's sad and tragic story has shocked @entity58			1
but criminal acts through the use of social media are not uncommon around the world			1
in the @entity80 , @entity79 was murdered by @entity81 who used @entity82 to find his victims			0
and in august , @entity84 pleaded guilty to murdering 18 - year - old @entity86 student @entity85 after stalking her , like @entity0 , through @entity32			2
@entity32 , @entity87 , @entity88 , blogs -- @entity91 internet use has exploded from just over two million users in 2005 to more than 44 million users today , according to the country 's @entity94			0
@entity58 are some of the most active users of social media on the continent and the @entity100 service is how millions of @entity58 communicate every day			1
but @entity0 's murder has touched a nerve and exposed the dark side of the web in a way that most had not imagined possible			2
and while many outside the country may express shock that a @entity58 would fall for what seemed like an offer too good to be true in a country known for fraud and corruption , the sad irony is that many @entity58 are , in reality , very open and trusting people			2
and @entity0 's murder really does seem senseless			2
after the suspects were arrested several other women came forward to say that they too had been drugged , tied up and robbed by the suspects			2
it is difficult to understand why @entity0 was killed			2
the police have some theories			0
perhaps , they say , the suspects became enraged at the lack of payday after spending so much money to get her there			0
or , maybe , @entity0 struggled or attempted to scream even after being drugged with the sedative @entity128			1

a staffer and the police told @entity146 that the suspects placed a call to reception and told them to get " the body of that bastard " out of the room			2
while police attempted to identify the body , @entity0 's mother tells @entity146 that she tried calling @entity0 's cell phone for five days but that the phone was switched off			1
on the seventh day , she says the suspects answered the phone and told her that @entity0 was sick			1
soon , they were asking her for ransom money			0
" i asked them if they killed my daughter and they said no , she was just sick and could n't come to the phone , " she said			0
within three weeks , the police were able to arrest the suspects through cell phone records and @entity170 footage of them leaving the hotel			1
several other men have been arrested in connection with the crime including the pharmacists who sold the @entity128 to the suspected killers without a prescription , their driver who police say always accompanied them during their robberies and a " fence " -- the man who sold @entity0 's and the other victims goods			1
the suspects are due in court on november 5 , exactly one month after @entity0 was laid to rest			1
the police say this is a cautionary tale and issued a call to parents to become more aware and vigilant about what their children are doing while surfing the web			0
@entity0 's family and friends agree			0
