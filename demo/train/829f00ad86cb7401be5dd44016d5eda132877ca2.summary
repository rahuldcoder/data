-- the outward signs of recovery were everywhere monday across the @entity3 nearly two weeks after @entity4 struck : power restored to tens of thousands , bridges and tunnels reopened , and limited train and ferry service up and running			1
" after two weeks of the recovery phase , we 've achieved a new normal for life in @entity15 , " gov. @entity10 said of his state			2
nearly everyone in the state has power back , nearly all schools are reopening , and gasoline rationing can end in the state , he said			1
ad - hoc army of volunteers feeds those still - powerless after @entity4 but , as officials in the stricken region emphasize , signs of struggle remain			1
in @entity29 alone , @entity4 inflicted about a $ 30 billion " economic loss , " gov. @entity28 said			1
for many , that loss and heartache is as fresh as it was when @entity4 came ashore			1
people are still clearing debris from their homes , standing watch among ruins to ward off looters , and putting on layers of clothing to battle the cold			0
some have been crying in each other 's arms as they face the devastation			2
gas rationing continues in @entity47 and @entity51 's @entity49 and @entity50 counties			1
@entity10 said it will take time to restore necessary services for those who live on @entity15 's barrier islands , because so much infrastructure was destroyed			2
" our resilience has always been our biggest strength , " @entity10 said			0
he said he has seen a lot of pain and tears across the state			2
but , he added , those suffering losses also say , " we 're rebuilding			0
" the death toll from @entity4 is at least 113 across several states , with 43 of those fatalities in @entity47 , according to @entity29 's chief medical examiner			1
authorities discovered the body of a 66 - year - old man who appeared to have drowned in his home on hard - hit @entity75 , while a 77 - year - old man from the battered beachside community of @entity78 in @entity79 died of injuries he suffered when he fell down a flight of stairs			0
not long after the superstorm , more than 8.6 million people were without power , the @entity84 @entity83 said			1
as of sunday morning , that was down to about 160,000 customers			0
map : see images of destruction , recovery across the @entity94 in @entity96 , on @entity29 's @entity51 , @entity95 used a flashlight to survey the storm debris pulled from his home and those of his neighbors : damaged mattresses , boxes of books and papers , and destroyed floor lamps			1
but it is the ongoing power outage that has proved most frustrating for @entity95 , who told @entity0 affiliate @entity108 in @entity29 late sunday that he was " frustrated , emotionally drained " by the experience			1
bundled up in a heavy jacket and knit cap , @entity95 joined hundreds over the weekend in @entity96 to protest a @entity113 requirement that every home undergo an inspection before power was returned			2
the ruling drew the ire of residents , who are battling the cold while trying to clean up their homes			0
some residents took to the streets in areas of the @entity49 community with handmade signs			0
others chanted : " help the harbor			0
" under fire by residents and officials , the @entity113 rescinded its inspection order			2
but it did little to curb anger among residents who believe they have been without power unnecessarily			2
" it 's ridiculous , " @entity136 told @entity108			0
" the governor should fire them all			0
" @entity28 , @entity29 's governor , said for about 58,000 customers in the @entity141 , @entity51 and @entity142 , it 's not just a matter of utilities doing their normal restoration work			1
for them , repairs must be done in and around their homes for electricity to return			2
" if you do n't have your power back , it probably means power ca n't be restored to your home at this time , " he said monday afternoon			0
opinion : rebuilding after @entity4 is too big a risk @entity113 said monday it has restored service to more than 97 % of customers whose homes and business can safely receive power			1
over 10,000 linemen and tree trim crews remain at work , meanwhile , for those still in the dark			0
another utility @entity170 announced its last @entity47 customers affected got their power back overnight , while all @entity174 customers had electricity back by monday			1
" the 1 million restorations do not include approximately 16,300 customers in flood - ravaged areas of @entity142 , @entity79 and @entity75 , " @entity170 said			0
" those customers can not get electrical service until their own internal equipment is repaired , tested and certified by an electrician as ready for service , " the company said on its website			0
@entity84 homeland security secretary @entity186 visited @entity47 on sunday			1
though she praised the response to the storm , she recognized that much work remains to be done			0
" this is going to be here for the long term			0
and we are here for the long term as well , " she said			0
more than 369,000 people in @entity15 , @entity29 , and @entity198 have registered for assistance from the @entity196 , which will total more than $ 455 million , @entity196 said			1
in his weekly radio address sunday , @entity47 mayor @entity200 detailed the city 's relief and rebuilding efforts , including the @entity206 program , which sends teams of inspectors , electricians , carpenters and contractors building - to - building to identify repairs needed , help building owners make repairs and get them reimbursed by the federal government for repair work			1
in that vein , the mayor signed an emergency order monday waiving all city application and permit fees for those doing @entity4 - related repairs			1
plus , those buildings with " significant structural damage " that will need to be demolished , altered or rebuilt " will have their repair work fees waived and all fees for electrical and plumbing repair work ... waived			0
" @entity233 , along with the city council speaker and city comptroller , later monday announced a a $ 500 million " emergency capital spending plan to make critical repairs to public schools and public hospitals			1
