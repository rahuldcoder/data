-- @entity4 president @entity3 has been in talks with high - level @entity7 members , but the effort has failed to yield " practical reconciliation " or the " resolution of many issues , " a senior @entity2 defense official said thursday			1
" we do n't think the @entity7 believe that they 're losing to the degree that they 'd come to terms in large numbers			2
without question , they 're hurting			0
we have it on good information that they 're feeling the pressure			0
just not enough , " the official told @entity0			0
@entity3 has been forging reconciliation efforts to seek peace with @entity7 members and end the nine - year - old @entity4 war			1
one idea his government has pushed is the @entity29 , which was formed to help negotiate with the @entity7			2
that group convened for the first time on thursday , a meeting in which @entity3 called for militants to seize the opportunity for peace			1
" i call on them once again to use this opportunity and say ' yes ' to this endeavour			0
i want them to come and bring peace to this land , " @entity3 told the group , made up of about 68 @entity4 clerics and elders			1
the senior @entity2 official said the peace council and its efforts may pay off down the road			1
the @entity2 military supports @entity3 's efforts , and that any reconciliation must be @entity4 - led , the official said			1
nevertheless , the official put high expectations in perspective , saying outsiders ca n't expect a " rock solid agreement " every time there are talks			0
" it will be messy , " the official said			0
the official also noted that the @entity7 and @entity64 have to be thought of , and dealt with , differently			2
" while @entity64 just wants to kill people , the @entity7 have definite governing ambitions			2
they want @entity4 back -- but to accomplish that , they only need to do the minimum			2
they do n't need to control every inch of land , just be present enough to exert influence , " the official said			0
the @entity64 terror network attacked the @entity2 on september 11 , 2001 , when it was harbored by @entity4 's @entity7 - led government			1
a month later , the @entity2 invaded @entity4 and toppled that government			2
another effort is also under way to forge peace			0
this week , political figures from @entity81 and @entity4 sat down in @entity82 for talks in what one @entity4 official called a " new phase " in building bridges and making peace with the @entity7			1
the meeting is part of an effort called the @entity93 process			0
a @entity7 spokesman has told @entity0 that the group was not interested in peace talks			1
@entity97 , the spokesman , said the group had no representative in the alleged negotiations in @entity82			0
peace negotiations would not happen until the @entity4 government met the @entity7 's precondition to withdraw foreign forces from the country , the spokesman said			1
journalist @entity107 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 tells the group it can help make peace in @entity4
the peace council *launches* as @entity4 *leaders* meet with @entity81 officials
the @entity7 says it is not part of the peace talks
