@entity0 -- the path to the @entity3 is paved with former frontrunners -- or maybe call them buzzleaders , since we 're three years away from 2016 and nobody is officially running for president yet			1
@entity8 has put three different @entity10 lawmakers on its cover			2
do n't forget to sprinkle that seasoning over all the sugary buzz surrounding @entity17 , who was emphatically reelected as @entity21 governor this week			1
the foreshadowing was evident as he sailed to victory and a second term			2
there 's no doubt @entity17 is mulling a run for president			1
" i know that if we can do this in @entity37 , @entity21 , then maybe the folks in @entity0 , should tune in their tvs right now and see how it 's done , " he said during his victory speech , suggesting he had found the right mix to work together with @entity33 and rise above partisan rancor			1
he was even more pointed with @entity1 's @entity41 when he suggested that @entity10 have veered away from a winning path and onto an ideological one			2
where does @entity17 go next ? " i think that the party 's got to focus on winning again , " @entity17 said from his campaign bus tuesday , sending a clear message to conservative idealists and the tea party			1
" you know , sometimes , i feel like our party cares more about winning the argument than they care about winning elections			2
and if you do n't win elections , you ca n't govern			0
and if you ca n't govern , you ca n't change the direction of a state , like we have done in @entity21			0
" the big question , assuming he does run for president , will be whether he can get conservatives he does n't see eye - to - eye with to support him in order to get to a general election			1
the @entity17 narrative goes like this : the dynamic @entity21 @entity10 has flourished as a red governor in a blue state			1
he 's defied unions and enacted conservative policies without doing something too drastic , the way @entity76 did with health insurance reform			2
he 's shown a willingness to work with @entity33			2
he showed leadership after @entity80			0
there 's no doubt about it : @entity17 won a huge victory tuesday			1
and the way the media works these days , a big win for a governor like @entity17 makes him the odds - on favorite to be the @entity10 nominee for president in 2016 , three years from now			1
or just ask @entity13 about working across party lines in @entity0			1
@entity15 is n't much known for working with @entity33 , but his buzz has faded lately as he 's dealt with a plagiarism scandal			2
and he has competed with sen. @entity97 for attention with the most conservative bulwarks of the party			2
when moderates fight back : @entity10 civil war could be brutal in 2014 elections @entity17 's relationship with social conservatives , a key @entity10 constituency , could be frustrated			1
he laid down his sword , for instance , when it became clear that courts would allow same - sex marriage in @entity112			0
but conservatives in @entity114 are n't ready to reject him simply because he lost the battle over same - sex marriage			2
" he accepted , i 'll say it , the position of gay marriage existing in @entity21 , " said rep. @entity117 , a @entity10 from the key state of @entity114			0
he said economic issues will be more important			0
" we 've had to make accommodations for that in @entity114			0
we have some experience with that			0
but he did n't endorse gay marriage			0
and the @entity133 themselves , i 've been in many discussions with them and tried to argue to the contrary , they say we want to stay with the economic and the constitutional issues			0
" and do n't forget : @entity76 , the @entity10 ' 2012 presidential nominee , was governor of the first state to allow same - sex marriage when courts there ok 'd the practice back in 2004			0
@entity17 has got the cover of @entity8 this week			1
back in february , it was @entity13 pictured confidently on the cover of that publication with the bold headline , " the @entity10 savior : how @entity13 became the new voice of the @entity10			1
" back then -- just this past february -- @entity13 was the young senator with tea party credentials and a willingness to work across the aisle			1
the @entity13 narrative is just as compelling as @entity156			1
the son of @entity159 immigrants came to @entity0 on a tea party wave and staked his career on a bold and politically courageous effort to rewrite the nation 's immigration laws			2
he sought to heal a perceived rift between @entity10 and @entity167 and bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows			0
it was a tortured process , but the @entity171 did , four months after @entity13 was featured on the @entity8 cover , pass 68 - 32 the immigration bill he helped write			1
it took mostly @entity33 votes to do it , however			0
and @entity13 's @entity133 cred was hurt			1
election night 2013 : @entity17 wins big , @entity179 provides drama now that bill on which @entity13 spent so much political capital is , as he told @entity1 's @entity183 on wednesday , " stuck			1
" and @entity13 is the first to admit he has paid a political price with @entity10 for working with @entity33 and supporting a pathway to citizenship			1
" i was in favor of immigration reform			0
it had nothing to do with politics of it , although it may have some political implications			0
it was because it was the right thing to do for our country			0
" the more conservative @entity197 wo n't touch @entity13 's bipartisan bill , which has put him in the tough position of potentially having to support something less expansive in order to get anything done			1
" what comprehensive bill on anything is going to get passed around here right now ? " he asked			0
" we ca n't even get a farm bill passed			0
" farm bills , fyi , are normally bipartisan and easily ratified			0
but not this year , with a stubborn @entity209 and a divisive president			2
" people think @entity0 is gross , " he said of the current atmosphere			0
later , @entity13 told bash he does n't yet know of any senators running for president ( meaning him ) , but he hopes his experience in @entity0 wo n't be a permanent liability			1
" you can work in @entity0 without being of @entity0 , " he said			0
" luckily , i have n't been here long enough to believe that what goes on here is normal			0

there 's no doubt @entity17 is mulling a run for president
the big question will be whether he can get conservatives to support him
sen. @entity13 's prominent *profile* has led to *complications* for the potential 2016 *contender*
