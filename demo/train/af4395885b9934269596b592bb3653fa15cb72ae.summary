editor 's note : @entity3 's novel " @entity2 " won the @entity4 in 2008			1
( @entity5 ) -- it was n't that i could n't write			1
i actually worked really hard at writing			1
at my desk by 7 a.m. , would work a full eight and more			2
scribbled at the dinner table , in bed , on the toilet , on the no. 6 train , at @entity15			2
i did everything i could			0
but none of it worked			0
my novel , which i had started with such hope shortly after publishing my first book of stories , would n't budge past the 75 - page mark			1
nothing i wrote past page 75 made any kind of sense			1
which would have been fine if the first 75 pages had n't been pretty damn cool			1
but they were cool , showed a lot of promise			1
would also have been fine if i could have just jumped to something else			0
all the other novels i tried sucked worse than the stalled one , and even more disturbing , i seemed to have lost the ability to write short stories			1
it was like i had somehow slipped into a @entity40 and i could n't find an exit			1
like i 'd been chained to the sinking ship of those 75 pages and there was no key and no patching the hole in the hull			1
i wrote and i wrote and i wrote , but nothing i produced was worth a damn			0
want to talk about stubborn ? i kept at it for five straight years			1
every day failing for five years ? i 'm a pretty stubborn , pretty hard - hearted character , but those five years of fail did a number on my psyche			1
five years , 60 months ? it just about wiped me out			1
by the end of that fifth year , perhaps in an attempt to save myself , to escape my despair , i started becoming convinced that i had written all i had to write , that i was a minor league @entity58 , a @entity60 @entity59 , that maybe it was time , for the sake of my mental health , for me to move on to another profession , and if the inspiration struck again some time in the future ... well , great			1
but i knew i could n't go on much more the way i was going			1
i was living with my fiancée at the time ( over now , another terrible story ) and was so depressed and self - loathing i could barely function			0
i finally broached the topic with her of , maybe , you know , doing something else			0
my fiancée was so desperate to see me happy ( and perhaps more than a little convinced by my fear that maybe the thread had run out on my talent ) that she told me to make a list of what else i could do besides writing			1
i 'm not a list person like she was , but i wrote one			0
it took a month to pencil down three things			0
( i really do n't have many other skills			1
) i stared at that list for about another month			0
waiting , hoping , praying for the book , for my writing , for my talent to catch fire			2
a last - second reprieve			0
so i put the manuscript away			0
all the hundreds of failed pages , boxed and hidden in a closet			1
i think i cried as i did it			0
five years of my life and the dream that i had of myself , all down the tubes because i could n't pull off something other people seemed to pull off with relative ease : a novel			1
by then i was n't even interested in a @entity103			2
i would have been elated with the eminently forgettable @entity105 novel			0
@entity5 : the real meaning of your " true calling " so i became a normal			0
i did n't go to bookstores or read the sunday book section of the @entity112			2
i stopped hanging out with my writer friends			2
the bouts of rage and despair , the fights with my fiancée ended			0
i slipped into my new morose half - life			0
started preparing for my next stage , back to school in september			0
( i wo n't even tell you what i was thinking of doing , too embarrassing			2
) while i waited for september to come around , i spent long hours in my writing room , sprawled on the floor , with the list on my chest , waiting for the promise of those words to leak through the paper into me			1
maybe i would have gone through with it			0
but if the world is what it is so are our hearts			0
one night in august , unable to sleep , sickened that i was giving up , but even more frightened by the thought of having to return to the writing , i dug out the manuscript			2
i figured if i could find one good thing in the pages i would go back to it			1
like flipping a coin , i 'd let the pages decide			2
spent the whole night reading everything i had written , and guess what ? it was still terrible			0
in fact with the new distance the lameness was even worse than i 'd thought			0
that 's when i should have put everything in the box			0
when i should have turned my back and trudged into my new life			0
i did n't have the heart to go on			2
but i guess i did			0
while my fiancée slept , i separated the 75 pages that were worthy from the mountain of loss , sat at my desk , and despite every part of me shrieking no no no no , i jumped back down the rabbit hole again			1
there were no sudden miracles			0
it took two more years of heartbreak , of being utterly , dismayingly lost before the novel i had dreamed about for all those years finally started revealing itself			2
and another three years after that before i could look up from my desk and say the word i 'd wanted to say for more than a decade : done			2
@entity5 : 4 writers answer " what makes you you ? " that 's my tale in a nutshell			0
not the tale of how i came to write my novel but rather of how i became a writer			1
because , in truth , i did n't become a writer the first time i put pen to paper or when i finished my first book ( easy ) or my second one ( hard )			1
you see , in my view a writer is a writer not because she writes well and easily , because she has amazing talent , because everything she does is golden			2
in my view a writer is a writer because even when there is no hope , even when nothing you do shows any sign of promise , you keep writing anyway			1
was n't until that night when i was faced with all those lousy pages that i realized , really realized , what it was exactly that i am			1

@entity3 almost quit writing years before he won a @entity4
he had 75 good pages but could n't write anything else he liked
after putting away hundreds of *filled* pages , he tried to think of other professions
says a writer is someone who ca n't stop writing -- even though no hope , no promise
