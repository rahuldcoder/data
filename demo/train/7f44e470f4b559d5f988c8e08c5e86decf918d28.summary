@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly two decades after the killing of toddler @entity4 by two 10 - year - old boys in a suburb of @entity8 , what remains one of @entity12 's most notorious child murders this week proved once again it has the power to shock and outrage			1
seen at the time as symbolic of a flawed society , the killing of @entity4 -- whose poignant last moments being led to his death were caught by security camera -- continues to be dissected by a country still struggling to comprehend the crime			2
this came to a head nine years ago when @entity12 authorities provoked anger by releasing the killers , @entity28 and @entity4 , just eight years into the life sentences they received for attacking and torturing @entity4 and dumping his battered body on a railway track			1
and the fury resurfaced this week with confirmation that one of the two boys , @entity4 , now a 27 - year - old man , was placed back in police custody after breaching the conditions of his release			1
the pair were jailed for an indefinite period in 1993 , but were released after @entity12 's @entity43 ruled that they were no longer a threat to the public			2
the @entity12 government has so far declined to reveal why @entity47 had been recalled into custody			1
legal commentator @entity49 told @entity2 police would not have acted lightly given the amount of money the authorities have spent on giving the boys new homes and identities			0
" i think one can surmise reasonably that ... it must be quite serious if there 's some intervention in that reset life , " he said			0
the conditions imposed on the boys on their release banned them from contacting each other , @entity4 's family or from returning to the region of @entity67 , in northwest @entity1 , where the crime was committed			1
@entity12 home secretary @entity69 told @entity70 the reason for the recall would be revealed in time			0
" i believe the public do have a right to know and i believe they will know all the facts in due course , " he said			0
however , @entity12 justice secretary @entity78 was quoted in the @entity79 wednesday as saying it was in the public interest to withhold the details			0
" i have no interest in gratuitously or unnecessarily withholding information , but there are good reasons to withhold it at the moment and that is in the public interest , " he said			0
@entity47 and @entity28 were school boys when they abducted and killed two - year - old @entity4 in a crime described by the trial judge as " unparalleled evil and barbarity			1
" in 1993 , grainy cctv images showed the boys leading the toddler away from his mother at a busy shopping center in @entity8 , @entity1			0
public anger grew as details emerged of the chilling attack in which the boys tried to drown @entity4 before beating him with rocks , bricks and iron rod			1
his battered body was left on a railway line to be cut in half by an oncoming train			2
in november 1993 , after being tried in an adult court , the boys were found guilty of murder and ordered to serve at least eight years of an indefinite prison sentence			0
the following year , their minimum sentences were increased to 15 years by then - @entity12 home secretary @entity118 who had received a petition signed by more than 275,000 people in support of life sentences			2
however in 1997 , the @entity123 , the upper chamber of parliament , overturned the increase and the boys were freed in 2001 on the condition that they could be recalled to custody at any time during their lives if there was " any evidence that they present a risk to the public			2
" the boys were given new identities and passports and since 2001 have been protected by an injunction banning publication of their images taken after 1993 , and anything that could reveal their current names and locations			0
both the boys received death threats and it was feared they would be targeted if their whereabouts were divulged			0
the first reaction from @entity4 's mother , @entity4 , to @entity47 ' detention was posted in a @entity151 message that read : " would like to let everyone know @entity4 is were he belongs tonight behind bars is this my sons justice			1
" the @entity12 parole board will now determine whether @entity47 should remain in custody or return to the life he has been given since his release from jail .			1
