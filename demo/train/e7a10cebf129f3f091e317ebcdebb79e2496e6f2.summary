@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 politician is facing a charge of vehicular homicide for the car crash that killed prominent @entity9 dissident @entity8 , @entity1 's state press said tuesday			1
@entity11 could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison if found guilty			1
he is accused of speeding and then losing control of a car that he , @entity8 , @entity17 politician @entity16 and @entity9 dissident @entity18 were traveling in			1
@entity8 and @entity18 were killed when the car struck a tree sunday near @entity20 , @entity1			2
the men had been traveling across the island to meet some of @entity8 's supporters in @entity1 when the crash occurred			1
the @entity9 government said the crash was the result of a single - car accident			1
@entity8 had tried for decades to change @entity1 's single - party system of government			1
he delivered thousands of signatures in an unsuccessful attempt to force a national referendum and was a constant critic of the @entity9 government			1
but @entity8 also had called for reconciliation between the polarized extremes that dominate the debate over @entity1 's future			2
following @entity8 's death , his family immediately accused @entity9 authorities of foul play and said they had received information that another vehicle had forced the car @entity8 was in off the road			1
" i ca n't take the word of the same government that wants to kill my husband , that threatened his life a ton of times , " @entity8 's widow , @entity47 , told @entity2			1
@entity55 said over the years her family suffered frequent intimidations at the hands of @entity9 state security			1
she said she would continue to have doubts about her husband 's death until she had the opportunity to interview both @entity16 and @entity11 herself			2
" i am asking for the intervention of an international organization that could send investigators here to do an analysis of the accident , " she said			0
on tuesday , @entity1 's official press published a 1,539 - word editorial on the crash titled " truth and reason			0
" the editorial announced that @entity11 would face charges and that @entity16 would be permitted to return to @entity17			0
both men had been held by @entity9 authorities since the crash			2
again the @entity9 government denied any hand in @entity8 's death			1
" it 's not @entity1 but the @entity85 that displays a shameful record of political assassinations , extra-official executions , including drone strikes , " the editorial said			0
on tuesday , @entity16 spoke to reporters at a hastily organized news conference			0
members of the international media in @entity1 were asked to arrive at the @entity94 and then were taken by buses to a house were officers of @entity1 's @entity98 stood guard			0
@entity16 then walked into the room where the press had gathered			0
sitting at a table with @entity9 officials , @entity16 said he was sorry for having traveled to @entity1 on a tourist visa to meet with members of the island 's dissident movements			2
he said he had come to " understand that these activities are not legal in @entity1 and i would like to apologize for coming here and doing illegal activities			1
" @entity16 denied that another vehicle had been involved in the crash			0
" i have no memory of any other car , " he said , but refused to elaborate on how the accident took place			0
after less than 10 minutes of speaking to the press , @entity16 said he did not want to take any more questions and left the room			0
on monday night , @entity9 state - television showed about 20 minutes of video of the meeting with foreign journalists along with video of a separate and apparently longer news conference that @entity16 gave solely to @entity1 's government - controlled media outlets			1
officials said holding two news conferences was necessary due " to space issues " at the house where @entity16 spoke			0
@entity11 , the @entity4 politician , did not speak , but a clip of a video was shown by officials in which @entity11 also said that the crash had been an accident			2
" as far as the news reports that they have let me read , i ask that the international community focuses on getting me out of here , " @entity11 said , " and not use a traffic accident that could happen to anyone for political purposes			0
" @entity9 state media usually does not discuss in such depth traffic accidents , much less what officials called " small factions of dissidents			1
" dissidents like @entity150 are generally referred to as " traitors " and " sell - outs " who have sided with the @entity85 government over @entity1 in the still - simmering war of words between the two countries			0
@entity8 's family said they were trying to adapt to life without him and with the added scrutiny his death brought			2
" all these things we have seen on tv and the accounts of what they call an accident is very unusual , " said @entity55 , @entity150 's widow			0
" but they do n't talk about who was @entity8			0

@entity11 could be sentenced to 10 years in prison if found guilty , state media says
@entity9 dissident @entity8 died in the crash ; his family *suspects* government foul play
another person in the crash apologizes " for coming here and doing illegal activities "
