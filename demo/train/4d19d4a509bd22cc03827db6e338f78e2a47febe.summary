he said some members of @entity8 's inner circle have also put under house arrest			1
the country 's constitution has been suspended , and @entity36 will " establish a government that is a strong and diverse , " said @entity34 , head of the country 's armed forces			0
new parliamentary elections will be held , and @entity36 will have the power to issue constitutional declarations in the meantime , he said			0
@entity34 said the military was fulfilling its " historic responsibility " to protect the country by ousting @entity8 , a @entity63 - educated @entity62 elected a year ago			2
@entity8 remained defiant and insisted he was @entity3 's proper president			1
" the world is looking at us today , " he said in a taped statement delivered to the @entity67 satellite network @entity68			0
" we by ourselves can bypass the obstacles			0
we , the sons of @entity3 , the sons of this country -- this is the will of the people and can not be canceled			2
" shortly after @entity8 's statement aired , @entity68 reported its @entity0 studios were raided during a live broadcast on wednesday and its presenter , guests and producers arrested			1
the @entity43 , the long - repressed political movement that propelled @entity8 to office , said its broadcast outlets had been shut down			1

@entity8 said he remains open to negotiations and dialogue , and he called on supporters to demonstrate peacefully			2
but at least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in clashes around the country on wednesday , health minister dr. @entity109 told @entity96			1
@entity114 student killed in @entity3 was enthralled with region @entity8 opponents who packed @entity117 , now the epicenter of two @entity3 upheavals , erupted in jubilation and fireworks when @entity34 made his announcement			1
" this is a united people of @entity3 , " @entity124 organizer @entity123 said			2
" @entity8 has actually succeeded in uniting the people , after two years that we were totally against each other ... @entity8 , with his bad management , with his risking all the lives of @entity3 , brought all @entity3 back together to be facing again their future , hand in hand			1
" but @entity134 , a former member of parliament from the @entity8 - allied @entity103 , called that " ridiculous			0
" " i do n't know how can anyone with common sense support a military coup in a democracy , " he said			0
@entity3 " will never recognize a coup d'etat , " he said			0
and across the @entity141 from @entity117 , @entity8 supporters chanted chanted " down with military rule " and " the square has a million martyrs			2
" before wednesday night 's announcement , troops moved into key positions around the capital , closing off a bridge over the @entity141 and surrounding @entity150 , where @entity8 's supporters were gathered			2
military had demanded reforms @entity8 was elected president in june 2012			0
but his approval ratings have plummeted as his government has failed to keep order or revive @entity3 's economy			2

as the hour of the ultimatum neared , @entity8 offered to form an interim coalition government to oversee parliamentary elections and revise the constitution that was enacted in january			0
" one of the mistakes i can not accept -- as the president of all @entity3 -- is to side with one party over another , or to present the scene from one side only			0
to be fair , we need to listen to the voice of people in all squares , " he said			0
@entity216 : stop using @entity114 taxpayer money to aid @entity8 shortly after the deadline , @entity8 aide @entity218 said in a @entity221 posting that a coup was under way and warned that the generals risked bloodshed by moving against @entity8			1
" in a democracy , there are simple consequences for the situation we see in @entity3 : the president loses the next election or his party gets penalized in the upcoming parliamentary elections			0
anything else is mob rule , " he wrote			0
but @entity237 , a member of the opposition @entity238 , said what was under way " is not by any means a military coup			0
" @entity8 lost his legitimacy in november , when he declared courts could not review his decrees and ousted the country 's prosecutor - general , @entity237 said			2
and the @entity43 " hijacked the vote of the people " by running on a religious platform , " so these were not democratic elections , " he said			0
@entity3 's @entity124 protestors -- in their own words @entity255 says @entity114 reviewing aid in @entity257 , president @entity255 said the @entity114 is " deeply concerned " by @entity8 's removal and the suspension of the constitution			1
@entity257 has supplied @entity3 's military with tens of billions in support and equipment over more than 30 years , and under @entity114 law , that support could be cut off after a coup -- a term his @entity269 statement avoided			1
" the @entity114 does not support particular individuals or political parties , but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the rule of law , " @entity255 said			1
he said he had ordered " the relevant departments and agencies " to study what @entity114 law would mean for @entity114 aid and urged the generals to hand power back to an elected government ' as soon as possible			2
" in the wake of @entity8 's ouster , @entity284 @entity283 ban ki - moon echoed @entity255 's call for an immediate return to civilian rule			1
he appealed for " calm , non-violence , dialogue and restraint			1

tuesday night , @entity8 had vowed that he would not comply with the ultimatum and demanded that the armed forces stand down , even " if the price of upholding this legitimacy is my own blood			0
" but political analyst @entity322 told @entity1 the speech was @entity8 's " final bluff			2
" " he was trying to give the impression ' we are there in numbers , and we are going to retaliate , we are not going to allow this to happen			0
' however , with almost 24 hours since his message , it 's clear his supporters will not dare challenge the crowds on the street , " @entity322 said			0
and faced with the throngs that filled @entity0 's @entity117 , " the military had to intervene			0
otherwise this crowd was going to get @entity8 from his palace			0
" @entity1 spells the deposed president 's name with a ' y ' in accordance with what his spokesman said is his personal preference , his own e-mail and the country 's @entity346			0
