@entity0 -- the humble thermostat is getting a 21st - century makeover			1
and so is the boombox , thanks to a son of the late reggae legend @entity7			1
the 2012 @entity8 does n't start in earnest until monday , but at a gadget preview event sunday , some electronics startups seemed determined to give redemption to ordinary appliances , and not just those from children of the rastafarian movement			1
in a packed hotel ballroom , companies demonstrated portable televisions , plastic guitars , stoves and solar - powered e-reader cases			1
here are five of the more intriguing gadgets we found : @entity26 for most of their existence , home thermostats have been mere functional accessories			2
@entity31 or beige , they blend into the wall and only get noticed when someone needs to change the temperature			0
with an elegantly simple dial that turns blue when cooling and orange when heating , the new nest digital thermostat seeks to change that			0
if it looks like something made by @entity43 , that 's because it 's designed by former @entity43 exec @entity45 , the man behind the look of the @entity47			0
" we 're the @entity51 of thermostats , " said @entity26 marketing spokeswoman @entity48 , continuing the @entity43 theme			1
" it 's the simplicity of the design			0
" @entity55 saves energy with motion - tracking sensors that detect when people enter or leave a room and adjust temperatures accordingly			2
it also tracks your energy - use history and energy savings			2
when it 's connected to @entity66 , it downloads software updates automatically			0
and if you 're lazy , you can control it wirelessly from your couch with your phone or tablet			2
it sells for $ 249 and is available from heating - and cooling - system installers or at @entity74 , although the website is currently sold out			2
@entity76 " we 're bringing back the boombox from the ' 80s ! " said @entity78 spokeswoman @entity77 cheerfully in what must surely be one of the stranger marketing pitches at a cutting - edge gadget show			2
the @entity76 is pretty much that -- a portable stereo with high - end components , a handsome birch wood face and an @entity51 / @entity47 dock , nestled inside a canvas shoulder bag			1
take it to the beach , to the college quad or to your next @entity95 game			0
the rechargeable battery promises five to six hours of music for your dancing , air - guitaring or spacing - out pleasure			2
the bag of @entity103 will sell for $ 300 when it hits the market in february , @entity77 said			0
the @entity78 company , which also makes earbuds and headphones , operated under a partnership with the late @entity7 's family			1
one of his sons , @entity112 , was at @entity8 to help promote the product			1
@entity115 tuner why is it that your uncle 's clunky old hand - held tv can pick up live channels , but our cutting - edge smartphones are left with 20 - second cat videos ? a new device called @entity125 can put live tv on an @entity128 phone , @entity51 or @entity129			1
the cork - size plastic gizmo has a headphone jack at the end of a short wire , which houses an antenna that can pick up digital tv signals			1
the wireless tv transmission is the same one that pipes into many homes that do n't subscribe to cable			2
that means no monthly fee , and watching hours of video does n't add up in costly cellular data bandwidth			0
@entity144 , the year - old company formed by such media giants as @entity146 and @entity147 , makes the mobile tv service			1
the company expects people will access live tv from their phones in addition to all on - demand content found online			1
the over-the - air broadcasts @entity125 pulls in are limited to a dozen or so channels			1
" we do n't think it 's one or the other , " @entity157 , an @entity144 general manager and also a @entity146 executive , said in an interview			0
" we think consumers want to do both			0
" @entity144 and @entity164 , which makes the accessory , declined to announce a price or release date			0
those details should come in the next few months , @entity157 said			0
@entity125 will also be included in an upcoming @entity170 @entity128 phone for @entity171 , a prototype that @entity144 demonstrated at the event sunday			1
a metal antenna can be extended from the top of the phone to improve reception -- and to make users look like they stepped out of a time machine from 1992			2
guitar apprentice " @entity183 " publisher @entity181 hung up its ax a year ago , but music equipment maker @entity185 is breathing new life into the plastic guitar with a new gizmo called the @entity180			1
the @entity190 - style guitar body has a slot in the soundboard for an @entity129 to be inserted			1
using a companion application , @entity194 players can run their fingers across virtual guitar strings while holding buttons on each fret along the neck to play musical notes			0
the buttons light up to teach newbies proper finger placement for playing each chord			0
virtual shredding will commence when the $ 99 @entity180 hits the market in june or july , an @entity185 spokesman said			0
prospective doors cover bands can already practice with @entity211 , a $ 100 , 25 - note keyboard with a place for hooking up an @entity129			1
@entity216 vital - signs monitor like some similar health - care gadgets , the @entity216 is a little gizmo with a sensor that plugs into the bottom of your @entity51			1
unlike those devices , however , you do n't have to put a clamp on your finger to read your vital signs			0
if you simply place your thumb on @entity216 's sensor for 60 seconds , it will tell you your heart rate , breathing cycle and blood - oxygen level			0
the @entity216 also will store your data on your phone so you can chart your heart or breathing rates over hours or days			0
manufacturer @entity238 , a @entity240 - based company , expects to debut the gadget in mid- 2012 and sell it for about $ 100 .			0

at a @entity8 preview event , @entity1 goes searching for *noteworthy* gadgets
among these are a @entity7 - inspired portable stereo and a guitar that pairs with an @entity129
new device called @entity125 can put live tv on an @entity128 phone , @entity51 or @entity129
