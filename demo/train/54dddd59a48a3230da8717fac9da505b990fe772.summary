the national fury over police brutality is thrusting the federal government into a role that dates back decades : ensuring the rights of african - americans are protected in a nation with a long history of racial inequality			1
after local grand juries in @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 , @entity14 , declined to charge white officers who killed unarmed african - americans with a crime , attention is shifting to @entity19			1
the call for a federal response echoes key moments during the civil rights movement when it became clear that local prosecutors and state authorities would not act			1
after all , it took the federal government to convict seven men on conspiracy charges for the 1964 killing of civil rights activists @entity33 , who was black , and @entity34 and @entity35 , who were white			1
now , the @entity36 is conducting two civil rights investigations of police in @entity11 after the killing 18 - year - old @entity39 at the hands of an officer			1
attorney general @entity42 is also formally launching a civil rights investigation into 43 - year - old @entity45 's death in @entity13			1
the outrage that followed the grand jury decision in both cases highlights the deep mistrust between many in the black community and the police			2
" local governments have historically failed to provide justice , especially for @entity60 communities , " said @entity52 , the president and executive director of the @entity54 , an organization formed in 1963 at the request of president @entity56			2
@entity61 to help combat racial discrimination			0
" that 's why people are able to breathe a sigh of relief , because they know there is a back door to hold these local governments accountable			0
" of course , the federal government has also been involved in more recent cases			2
" you do n't have to go all the way back to the @entity80 to find an analogue , " said @entity71 , a professor at @entity72 and president and director - counsel of the @entity75 , pointing to the @entity77 case			0
" on the one hand , it 's unfortunate			0
on the other hand , it 's a really great thing that we have federal civil rights statutes			1
" in 1992 , a jury in @entity89 , @entity90 , acquitted four @entity92 officers in the beating of @entity77 , but two of them were later convicted of violating his civil rights in a federal trial and served 32 months in prison			1
after @entity99 died by asphyxiation during an altercation with police in @entity103 , @entity14 , in 1994 , the arresting officer , @entity98 , was acquitted on state charges , but later convicted in federal court of violating @entity99 's civil rights			1
as recently as april , the @entity36 found that the police department in @entity108 , @entity109 , engaged in " a pattern or practice of use of excessive force , including deadly force " that violated people 's civil rights			1
and on thursday , @entity42 announced that a civil rights investigation had found that the @entity119 police department also engaged in unreasonable force in violation of the @entity122			1
people may call on the federal government to step in on these cases because they place more trust in federal officials to deal with these matters			2
but when it comes to actually changing police tactics , there is still a long way to go , said @entity134 professor @entity133			0
" what 's happened here in my opinion is yes , the federal government has gotten involved before with the police , but has that involvement led to meaningful progress ? ' asked @entity133 , who pointed to continued allegations of corruption and unfair treatment by the @entity92 years after the @entity77 case			2
" i do n't really know how effective the federal government has been in police reform			0
" going beyond purely courtroom battles , it was president @entity151 whose 1948 executive order integrated the armed forces			0
and the federal government 's help was essential in many of the civil rights fights of the 1950s and 1960s			1
in 1957 , it took federal troops ordered in by president @entity160 to protect the nine black students trying to integrate @entity163 's @entity162			0
still , federal involvement has n't always provided meaningful protections or a change in the reality on the ground			2
many of the federal civil rights statutes in use today have their roots in the reconstruction period after the @entity174 , @entity71 said			1
that 's when @entity176 enacted the @entity177 of 1871 , at the urging of president @entity179			0
the law was meant to protect blacks from groups conspiring to deprive them of their constitutional rights , but it did n't stop decades of lynchings and other forms of violence perpetrated against blacks			2
but lasting change is @entity42 's goal			0
@entity52 said the activism of the @entity36 in recent years when it comes to civil rights has a lot to do with @entity42 himself			1
watch : @entity195 after incident she called him an attorney general with a level of commitment to racial justice that had not been seen since @entity202 , the nation 's top law man under president @entity204			0
while a deputy attorney general in 1963 , @entity202 confronted @entity207 's staunch segregationist gov. @entity206 on the steps of the @entity209 so that two black students could register there			0
these latest investigations come at a time of change at the department , as @entity42 prepares to leave and the president 's pick to replace him , @entity218 , the @entity219 attorney for the @entity220 , plans to take the helm and carry on @entity42 's work if she 's confirmed by @entity176 early next year			0
in a statement released after the grand jury 's decision in the @entity45 case was announced , @entity218 said the federal investigation will be " fair and through , and it will be conducted as expeditiously as possible			0

focus in civil rights cases is turning to @entity19
