@entity0 -- now that we have @entity4 , a @entity5 , on the @entity6 , the esteemed body will soon find itself in the middle of a telenovela			1
the storyline involves the contentious issue of affirmative action , which is central to @entity12 vs. @entity13 , a case that is scheduled to come before the court this fall			1
it will cast a spotlight on two of the court 's justices : @entity4 and @entity21			1
affirmative action seems to be intensely personal to both of them , though for very different reasons			1
first , let 's take a minute to note just how similar @entity21 and @entity4 are in terms of their background			1
both are baby boomers , born just a few years apart			0
@entity21 is 61 years old and @entity4 is 57			1
they grew up in neighboring states			0
@entity21 is from @entity34 and @entity4 is from @entity35			1
both came from ethnic , working - class families			0
@entity21 's parents were teachers , @entity4 's father was a tool - and - die worker and her mother was a telephone operator			2
finally , both went to @entity43 and @entity44 , where both served as editors of the @entity46			0
given all those similarities , what could these two @entity6 justices possibly have to argue about ? affirmative action			1
will the @entity6 strike down affirmative action ? @entity21 has highlighted in a 1985 job application for promotion to officials in the @entity56 of the @entity58 administration that he belonged to a group called @entity60			1
and what were the @entity43 alumni so concerned about ? why , that there were supposedly too many women and minorities being admitted to the prestigious but predominantly white institution			0
@entity4 has said that she is a " product of affirmative action " and the " perfect affirmative action baby			1
" although she graduated with honors from both @entity43 and @entity44 , she admitted that her test scores " were not comparable " to her classmates at both schools			0
now imagine how these two justices will weigh in on the case of @entity76			0
this is not the first time that the @entity13 has found itself in the eye of a storm because of its admissions policies			2
in the 1990s , @entity82 successfully sued the law school at @entity13 for its affirmative action program			1
in an attempt to preserve diversity gains , the @entity85 passed the " 10 percent rule , " which required public universities in the state to admit students from the top 10 percent of the graduating class of every @entity94 high school			2
the idea was that ethnic diversity can be achieved without explicitly considering the race factor			0
but , in 2003 , after the @entity6 gave public colleges and universities the green light to take race into account as a factor in admissions , the @entity13 revised its policies accordingly to admit students who did n't make it into the top 10 percent			1
this is the policy now being challenged			0
@entity12 and @entity112 , two white students who did n't get into the @entity13 as undergraduates in 2008 , claim that it was their race that kept them out , since minority students who they considered less qualified were admitted			2
were there no other white students admitted to the @entity13 that year ? we can assume there were , and so the idea that it was the plaintiffs ' race that kept them out is questionable			2
even so , commentators who follow the @entity6 closely are predicting that the case will deliver a death blow to affirmative action for public colleges and universities			1
there are at least five justices who will probably oppose racial preferences , including @entity21			2
meanwhile , the dissenters are likely to include @entity4			0
do n't be surprised if her dissent in this case will contain a tone that is unmistakably personal			0
maybe @entity4 will reflect on @entity140 's dissent in the landmark 1978 @entity6 case , @entity135 , which also involved a challenge to race - based admissions			1
in that case , a majority of the justices agreed that @entity135 , a 32 - year - old white male , should have been admitted to the @entity147			0
@entity148 had been denied admission , he claimed , because of a special program that set aside for african - americans 16 of the 100 seats in the entering class			0
@entity140 -- who was the only @entity155 - @entity151 justice on the @entity6 and probably the only one who ever experienced racial discrimination firsthand -- did not agree that @entity148 should have been admitted , and he wrote a powerful dissent that none of his white colleagues could have written			0
it is at moments like this -- when more women and minorities are in places of power and influence -- that we see the payoff of affirmative action and other efforts to expand educational and professional opportunities for all @entity151			2
we view controversial issues with our heart , as much as with our head			0
we see them through a lens shaped by personal experiences			1
as a @entity184 - @entity151 graduate of an @entity186 university , here is what my lens tells me			0
part of what @entity21 and the other @entity43 alumni were really concerned about was that -- if something was n't done to keep women and minorities out of prestigious colleges and universities -- one day , white males may have to deal with them as equals			2
watch how @entity4 handles this case about affirmative action , and you 'll see : that day is here			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203			0

the @entity6 will hear arguments for @entity12 vs. @entity13
the case will determine the fate of affirmative action in public universities
@entity203 : @entity21 and @entity4 will likely take the issues personally
@entity203 : the ways we see issues are often shaped by personal experiences
