-- there are few topics in sport more taboo than betting			2
but a new organization is wagering that it 's not only possible to openly bet on @entity9 athletes , you can raise money for charity at the same time			1
@entity12 , founded by @entity14 track and field alums , allows anyone to select from a roster of @entity9 hopefuls who 've agreed to let their performance be bet on			1
all money wagered will go to the charity of the athlete 's choice			1
it 's a first of its kind concept that 's sure to generate attention as the summer @entity26 draw closer			2
it appears to have no opposition			2
even the @entity29 thinks the idea is not betting , technically , and would n't fly in the face of @entity9 rules			1
" on the surface , it seems to be a site dedicated to helping charities raise money , which we would obviously have no problem with , " @entity29 spokesman @entity33 said			2
when @entity44 agreed to participate , the four - time @entity42 running champion who competed at the @entity43 spent a long time doing his homework about the organization			1
" the more i learned about this idea , it just seemed like a win - win , " he said			0
starting in june , anyone can bet on whether @entity44 will score a spot at the @entity9 when he competes at qualifying trials in @entity53 , @entity54			1
here 's how it works : you could bet any amount ( say , $ 75 ) that @entity44 will make the team or that he 'll go " vver			1
" or , you can bet any amount ( say , $ 10 ) on the " under , " meaning he wo n't make the team			2
if @entity44 qualifies , all $ 75 goes to his charity , the @entity63			1
if he has a bad day , his charity will get only the amount you wagered against him			1
do n't feel like betting anything if he does n't make it ? put a zero in that " under " wager box			0
" it would be nice if no one bet against me , but no matter what -- for or against -- it 's the same motivation because i know people are involved in my performance , " @entity44 said			1
" @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , helped me out a lot growing up			0
i did n't have much , and i really depended on that place to keep me focused			0
i feel like it 's almost something i could n't turn away from if i had the chance , and it 's innocent betting			2
" other @entity9 hopefuls who 've signed up with @entity84 include sprinter @entity85 , who finished second to @entity86 in the 100 and 200 meters in world championships this summer , and runner @entity88 , who took gold at the @entity43			1
gamblers will be able to bet whether they 'll make the @entity9 trials in @entity54 as well , @entity91 co-founder @entity90 said			1
the 32 - year - old started @entity91 with @entity95 , 31 , a fellow former @entity14 track teammate ; both are the sons of breast cancer survivors			0
after graduation , the two took jobs in @entity101 and worked with a lot of @entity104 go - getters with well - worn gym memberships who did triathlons and other weekend amateur events			0
they began brainstorming about how to inspire pros and weekend warriors to raise money for worthy causes			2
the friends started @entity91 in november			0
the first competitor who signed with them was @entity116 , a former @entity118 @entity117 runner from @entity119 who represented the @entity42 at the @entity120 in @entity121			1
@entity122 is a retired runner but agreed to run a @entity123 last year to raise money for a charity he selected			1
" we saw from @entity116 that we had interest and concept that worked logistically , " @entity90 said			0
" naturally , we wanted to take it to the biggest playing field possible			0
" 2004 @entity9 silver medalist @entity132 worked with @entity91 in january before competing at @entity42 marathon trials in @entity134			1
@entity132 set a place - based goal			0
the over / under on him was based on whether he finished the marathon in the top three			0
the 36 - year - old won the trial with a time of 2:09:08 , setting a personal best by 5 seconds			0
he signed up with @entity91 about two weeks before competing			0
few people knew about it , but he still raised $ 1,000 for the @entity146 , which promotes health and fitness , according to his brother and manager , @entity151			0
the @entity42 distance star is considering teaming again with @entity91 at the @entity154 games			0
" anytime you can get spectators to invest in the race , in any way , it 's exciting , " @entity155 said			2
" once people understand the idea , i ca n't imagine anyone not getting behind it			0
