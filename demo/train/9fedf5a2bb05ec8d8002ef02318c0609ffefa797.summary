" @entity0 look around the region and they say to themselves -- ' we 're lucky -- the streets are safe			1
' " those were the words of a former @entity0 minister speaking to @entity8 on a bleak , damp day in @entity9 18 months ago			1
at the time , @entity10 and @entity11 were in turmoil , @entity13 's president had fled , and @entity16 protesters were taking to the streets of @entity18			2
but even then , there was plenty of grumbling in @entity0 -- over gas prices , unemployment , pervasive corruption			1
tribal sheiks described their disappointment with @entity27 , who succeeded his father to the throne in 1999			2
in towns like @entity32 , near the @entity34 border and traditionally a bedrock of support for the monarchy , there was an undercurrent of resentment -- especially toward @entity40 for her alleged lavish lifestyle			0
those same grievances have stoked the current protests , triggered by a sudden and sharp increase in the price of cooking oil and fuel as state subsidies have been withdrawn			1
now @entity27 confronts what analysts in @entity9 say is the biggest crisis of his 13 - year reign			0
@entity53 -- an @entity9 - based commentator and syndicated columnist -- says the economic crunch is merging with evermore strident demands for political change , now led by the @entity58			0
but the sometimes violent protests in @entity9 and elsewhere this week have also included young men from poor areas , and for the first time a refrain from protests elsewhere in the @entity65 world -- " the people want the @entity67 " -- has been heard			0
the street protests this week have underlined a growing divide between older tribal leaders and a younger generation that 's " on a totally different bandwidth , " @entity53 says			2
@entity53 and others do not believe the monarchy is under threat			2
@entity0 's military , security and intelligence services are efficient and intensely loyal			1
but the threat of more unrest beckons , and could deter what little foreign investment @entity0 attracts			1
the @entity84 , the political arm of the @entity58 , is demanding the price hikes be rescinded immediately			1
it also wants changes to the election law -- and constitutional reform so that the prime minister is directly elected and not appointed by the king			0
@entity93 , which intends to boycott parliamentary elections in january , has built alliances with other opposition groups			2
the government appears adamant that with the state 's coffers nearly bare and compensation offered to the poorest , subsidies have to be reduced			0
that 's the condition set by the @entity103 for $ 2 billion in further credit			0
@entity0 simply ca n't survive without foreign aid			1
the state has a huge role in the economy -- as employer of more than one - third the work force and in subsidizing the price of basic commodities which consumes almost one quarter of all government spending			2
when it ca n't afford those subsidies , or the @entity103 demands they are reduced in return for loans , trouble is not far away			0
as in @entity10 and other @entity65 countries , the @entity0 " street " is hypersensitive to the price of bread and cooking oil			1
most @entity0 struggle to get by : the average per capita income is $ 6,500			1
@entity129 " shocks " provoked street protests in 1989 and 1996 -- just as they did in @entity10 in 1979 and 2007			0
the @entity131 's current problems echo those of 1989			0
aid was declining , but spending was rising amid ever - worsening unemployment			2
as part of a deal with the @entity103 , the government cut subsidies on basic goods and riots erupted in southern @entity0 , quickly turning into more general protests against the government			1
the same syndrome has taken hold this year , worsened by cuts in gas supplies from @entity10 to less than one - fifth the agreed amount			0
the government has already tried once ( in august ) to tackle subsidies , but retreated in the face of protests			0
despite its lack of size and economic clout , @entity0 matters to the @entity156			1
the @entity131 has been consistently pro-western , is one of only two @entity65 states to have a peace treaty with @entity160 and is at the heart of a volatile neighborhood			0
in the past it has quietly allowed the @entity165 and @entity166 militaries to use its territory and facilities as a staging ground			0
about half of @entity0 's population is @entity172 , and the monarchy has worked hard to ensure peace between them and the various tribes that live there			1
the @entity131 's geography -- as a neighbor of @entity160 , @entity34 , @entity180 and @entity181 -- has thrown up awkward and sometimes impossible choices			0
its current financial situation is not helped by the presence of some 200,000 @entity34 refugees on @entity0 soil and @entity27 's cautious attitude toward events in @entity34 -- while @entity0 is quietly helping the @entity34 opposition , it has kept its ambassador in @entity192			1
@entity53 says the less - than - wholehearted @entity0 support for the @entity34 rebels may explain why @entity180 has not delivered the expected level of financial aid this year			1
there is also a growing threat from @entity200 / jihadi groups			1
@entity201 of the @entity202 says @entity200 have acquired weapons from @entity34 and points out that @entity0 intelligence recently uncovered a plot to launch terror attacks on diplomatic missions in @entity9			1
radical clerics such as @entity209 have called for sharia rule in @entity0 to replace " the gang of corruptors " in power			1
@entity53 says some commentators , himself included , believe that as trust in the monarchy erodes , it 's time for a " grand political initiative " from the king -- one that addresses the current dissent and sets a new role for the monarch within a revised constitution			0
the @entity165 says it supports both the king 's road map for reform -- which gradually shifts more power to the elected parliament -- and demands for a more inclusive political process			0
but the two may not be compatible			0
the tribes do n't want to see the largely urban @entity58 -- which derives much of its support from @entity0 's @entity172 population -- gain power at their expense			2
economic crisis , a government virtually out of money , a generational divide , political deadlock , rising unrest in neighboring countries : @entity27 faces a multifaceted challenge that would have tested the abilities of his wily father .			2
