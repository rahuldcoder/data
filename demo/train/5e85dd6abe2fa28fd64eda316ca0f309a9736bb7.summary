the dish is said to bring good luck in the new year			1
different folklore traces the history and the name of this meal , but the current dish has its roots in @entity64 and @entity63 traditions and was most likely brought over by slaves to @entity66			0
a recipe for @entity39 appears as early as 1847 in @entity69 's " the @entity68 " and has been reinterpreted over the centuries by home and professional chefs			1
