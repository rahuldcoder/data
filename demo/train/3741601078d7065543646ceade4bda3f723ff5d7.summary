-- what are the chances you walk into work and the lead story is @entity6 has had a double mastectomy when you are facing one yourself ? i have been struggling for weeks with how to tell my co-workers and viewers that i have breast cancer and have chosen to have a double mastectomy			1
how much should i share ? will i be an emotional wreck ? do i want people feeling sorry for me ? @entity6 empowered me to share my story			1
i was diagnosed with breast cancer five weeks ago , on april 9			1
saying it , talking about it , dealing with it has been a complicated journey			1
luckily , i have a very early form of breast cancer called @entity23			1
mri scans show some questionable areas in my left breast and many in my right			1
after several consultations with some of the finest doctors in @entity34 and @entity35 ( my hometown ) , volumes of research and some serious soul searching , i have chosen to have a double mastectomy			1
@entity6 chose to bear her soul in writing and i chose to follow her lead in front of all our viewers tuesday			1
i identified with some of the issues she candidly discussed , such as her children , her sexuality and her femininity			1
i never expected to share this news so publicly and i certainly did not want to become the story			2
but judging from the outpouring of support , i am not alone			1
i have a history of fibrocystic breast tissue , which is very dense and complicated to read in a mammogram			1
for years , i 've had biopsies and two years ago , prior to starting at @entity0 , i had a lumpectomy to remove abnormal tissue that doctors thought was cancer			1
one doctor said that in my case cancer was a matter of when , not if			1
still , when i got the call five weeks ago , it knocked me over			2
my greatest challenge was sharing the news with the people who love me			2
my son @entity69 and my daughter @entity70 were the hardest			2
i sat with @entity69 , 14 , and asked him what came to mind when he thought of breast cancer			1
his response was a fight			2
i knew then he had the right attitude			2
i pulled out the book " @entity78 " and explained in great detail what my diagnosis was and how i chose to treat it			2
he listened intently but still worried i was going to die			2
i explained that my decision gave me the best chance of survival long term			2
i promised this would not kill me			2
i agonized for weeks about how to tell my daughter , and even consulted a psychologist			0
would she instantly think her breasts were sick , too ? were they ? would the information scare her and would she be overwhelmed by fear of losing me and potentially getting sick herself ? i worried about nothing			0
i asked her the same question i asked @entity69 and her response was that breast cancer makes people 's hair fall out and that they get sick			1
i told her neither would happen to me and that i would have surgery and be back in no time			0
that was plenty for her			0
i surprised myself by worrying about my sexuality			0
logically , i knew that getting rid of all the breast tissue was the best decision for me			1
but would i still be attractive and desirable to my partner ? i was angry at myself for even caring about that , but i did			0
i was choosing reconstruction , so that to the outside world nothing would look different -- but i knew and he knew			0
@entity115 , my @entity116 © , was focused on making me whole			0
he said nothing mattered more to him than having me alive			0
@entity115 happens to be executive vice president of the @entity119 and travels nonstop			0
but he halted his schedule so he could be by my side for every appointment and every moment of vulnerability			0
he held my hand and sat with me when i cried			0
we have talked in great detail with doctors about the changes ahead , and privately about our personal feelings			0
they have been graphic , emotional conversations that have made us stronger			0
early on , a very dear friend told me very matter - of - factly to treat this cancer as a pain - in - the - ass inconvenience			1
getting there takes time and , in my case , a lot of prayer and a lot of research			0
i hope that every woman facing this decision takes the time to understand her options and surrounds herself with the support she needs to get through the difficult times			1
there are challenges to access that need to be tackled , especially for our @entity155 women			0
there is a lot of work and i am poised for the challenge to help others like me			0
i am grateful for the support and information available to me			1
my goal is to pay my many blessings forward			0
what i know , you will know			0
i am not yet on the other side , but judging by all the e-mails i 've received from survivors , i am headed to a place that is stronger , wiser and definitely more empowered			1
my final words here are thank you -- for the many blessings , thoughts , prayers and even hugs you have sent my way today			0
