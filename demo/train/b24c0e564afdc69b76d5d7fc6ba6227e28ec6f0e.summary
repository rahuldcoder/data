@entity1 conservatives should be worried			2
evangelical churches that frequently support conservative candidates are finally admitting something the rest of us have known for some time : their young adult members are abandoning church in significant numbers and taking their voting power with them			1
@entity13 , the 38 - year - old president of the @entity14 , an evangelical research firm , is the latest to sound the alarm			2
in his new book , " @entity16 : why @entity21 and @entity22 , " he says that 18 - to 29 - year - olds have fallen down a " black hole " of church attendance			2
there is a 43 % drop in christian church attendance between the teen and early adult years , he says			2
these young dropouts value the sense of community their churches provide but are tired of being told how they should live their lives			1
they do n't appreciate being condemned for living with a partner , straight or gay , outside of marriage or opting for abortion to terminate an unplanned pregnancy			2
this does n't mean that they necessarily will vote for president @entity43 in 2012			1
jobs and higher wages are their priority just as they are for everyone else ; the nominee who convinces the millennials that they 'll be better off financially will get their vote			1
but if neither party is persuasive , the former evangelicals may vote @entity53 because of that party 's more moderate stance on social issues			1
or they could simply sit out the election			2
@entity58 , a 24 - year - old veterinary technician , is an example of the newly disaffected			2
in high school , she attended a conservative @entity61 in northern @entity62			2
she enrolled in college thinking of herself as a conservative and not wanting to have sex until she was married			0
her views changed when she met her boyfriend			0
she began to question the theology of her home church on a number of social issues			1
" i know i 'm a @entity72 and believe in @entity73 , but the church has n't helped me in my struggles , " she says			0
" it really does n't affect anything in life right now			0
" the result ? " i do n't go to any church			0
" and how does she feel about next year 's election ? " there are many times i think i 'd rather not vote at all			1
" in lifestyle and beliefs , she is far from an outlier			0
consider the following facts about millennials in general : seven in 10 millennials say sex between an unmarried man and woman is morally acceptable ( @entity92 )			1
( according to @entity13 , young @entity72 are as sexually active as non-christians			1
) most women in their early 20s who give birth are unmarried			0
more than six in 10 millennials ( including 49 % of @entity1 millennials ) support same - sex marriages			1
six in 10 millennials say abortion should be legal ( @entity92 ) , a higher proportion than found in the general population			1
a higher percentage say abortion services should be available in local communities			0
millennials also part ways with conservative orthodoxy on wealth distribution and caring for the environment			1
according to a report in the @entity114 , three out of four say that wealthy corporations and financiers have too much power and that taxes should be raised on the very wealthy , and two out of three say financial institutions should be regulated more closely			0
in addition , most say that creationists ' view on evolution is outdated			0
sounds a lot like @entity53 ideology to me			1
of course , every generation rethinks its beliefs and values during young adulthood			1
even the most liberal tend to moderate their views once they marry , have children and start paying a mortgage			0
some of them return to church , if only for the structured support of a congregation and the moral instruction their sons and daughters can receive			0
but here 's the thing : this particular generation is marrying later than prior generations , if they marry at all			0
they 're having children -- and assuming a mortgage -- later			0
the longer they stay away from church , the less likely they are to come back			0
" what used to be two or three years of dropping out is a decade or more , " author @entity13 said			0
in 2008 , then - presidential contender @entity43 received a healthy 33 % of the young white evangelical vote			1
if he and his team offer millennials concrete ideas for improving their dismal job situation , he could repeat or even improve upon that in 2012			2
so far , however , @entity43 and mainstream democrats have done little to reach out to younger voters other than ease the burden of paying off college loans , a not - insignificant move			0
perhaps they hold to the theory that presidential elections are the domain of the 40 - plus crowd , an assumption increasingly outdated by the speed and breadth with which millennials communicate over the @entity174			1
in a very tight race , votes cast by this generation -- which has grown in number by 4 million since the last election -- might make the difference			1
their votes will be significant for sure by the end of this decade because by then , millennials will make up a third of the @entity187 adult population			1
and that 's a good thing			0
as the most diverse generation ever , they 've shown themselves to be better than their elders at seeking areas of common ground and making compromises			0
they 're also more optimistic : despite the economic instability of their generation , more than two - thirds believe they can achieve success regardless of race , ethnicity or social class			1
all of us , whether we 're churched or unchurched , could use that kind of faith .			0

many young evangelicals are abandoning their churches , says @entity211
these young dropouts are tired of being told how they should live their lives , @entity211 says
because of social issues , former evangelicals may very well vote @entity53 , she says
@entity211 : in a very tight presidential race , millennials ' votes might make the difference
