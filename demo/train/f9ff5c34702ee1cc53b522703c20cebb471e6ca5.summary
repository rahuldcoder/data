-- relations between the @entity2 and @entity3 deteriorated sharply as the @entity2 appeared to ignore a commission looking into complaints of physical and sexual abuse of children by @entity9 priests , according to @entity11 diplomatic cables obtained by @entity12			1
one cable from earlier this year says the @entity2 was angered by the way the @entity15 -- which was looking into the how complaints of abuse had been handled by the @entity18 and @entity9 government -- sidestepped normal diplomatic channels			1
the commission had written directly to the @entity2 to seek information and requested a meeting with the @entity2 's representative in @entity3			1
the @entity2 envoy did not respond , according to the cable			2
the cable was one of several published friday by the @entity28 newspaper in @entity29			0
the @entity15 was appointed after another inquiry issued a report in may 2009 detailing horrific abuses , including 325 alleged cases of abuse by priests , and concluding that the problem was endemic			0
" the @entity2 believes the @entity9 government failed to respect and protect @entity2 sovereignty during the investigations , " the charge d'affaires at the @entity11 embassy to the @entity2 , wrote in february 2010			1
" adding insult to injury , @entity2 officials also believed some @entity9 opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the @entity50 reply			1
" but the cable added : " much of the @entity9 public views the @entity50 protests as pettily procedural and failing to confront the real issue of horrific abuse and cover - up by @entity18 officials			1
" " resentment toward the @entity18 in @entity59 remains very high , particularly because of the institutionalized cover - up of abuse by the @entity18 hierarchy			0
" but @entity11 diplomats credit the @entity2 with responding to the unfolding crisis in @entity3 " with uncharacteristic speed			2
" " the @entity2 's relatively swift response to this crisis showed it learned key lessons from the @entity11 sex abuse scandals in 2002 but still left some @entity18 -- in @entity3 and beyond -- feeling disaffected , " the @entity11 charge d'affaires wrote			2
victims ' associations were complaining at the time that @entity74 @entity73 had not issued an apology for the abuses and had not ordered the removal of the remaining bishop accused of the cover - up , even though he said he shared the " outrage , betrayal , and shame " of @entity82			0
the following month the pope did offer an apology to the victims			0
" you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry			0
i know that nothing can undo the wrong you have endured , " he said			0
looking to the longer term , the @entity11 diplomat wrote that the prestige and power of the @entity9 @entity18 had been falling ever since its peak with the 1979 visit of pope @entity98 the abuse scandals had come amid increasing secularization of society and might further reduce the influence of the @entity18 , she wrote			0
" our contacts at the @entity2 and in @entity3 expect the crisis in the @entity9 @entity18 to be protracted over several years , as only allegations from the @entity109 @entity108 have been investigated to date , " the cable says .			1
