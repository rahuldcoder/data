speaking saturday at a bipartisan national security conference at the @entity12 , gen. @entity10 said , " fifty percent of our units that are at home station today , they are at a degraded state of readiness			2
" @entity10 said that includes " equipment shortfalls , or personnel shortfalls , and the reason is because of the high operational tempo we have today			1
