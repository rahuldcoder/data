@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 ceo @entity3 favors the little guy , but that attitude can pose obstacles for popular websites that want to work with his company			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , which are among the biggest technology businesses in the world , find themselves stonewalled at times by @entity3 and company			1
that sometimes results in less functional applications			0
@entity11 launched its music - centric social network , called @entity20 , as part of an @entity23 update that contained a @entity4 component			1
but @entity11 had to remove integration with the world 's largest social network hours after @entity20 launched			2
last week @entity28 announced an agreement with @entity11 's @entity20			2
@entity30 , @entity11 's ceo , spurned @entity4 for what he considered were " onerous terms			1
" when questioned about this in an interview onstage at the @entity35 in @entity0 on tuesday , @entity3 said with a shrug , " it 's fine			2
" then @entity3 pointed out that the two work together in many ways			1
for example , @entity4 's app " is on the vast majority of @entity42 , " he said at an event earlier this month at @entity4 's @entity40 , @entity1 , headquarters			2
as for @entity4 's relationship with @entity12 , the two are in the midst of a public spat about letting users import and export personal data between the social network and @entity53			1
@entity4 , which launched an email service on monday , does n't let users easily migrate addresses to other apps			1
@entity3 said at the conference on tuesday that this move was meant to protect the private contact information of a user 's friends			0
he backtracked near the end of that fireside chat and highlighted the data export issue as a potential mistake			0
" i 've made so many mistakes in running the company so far , " he said			0
" we still make mistakes all of the time			0
" the trouble , he said , is figuring out which of the company 's myriad problems " really matter			0
" @entity3 also seemed to distance himself from @entity12 , the undisputed leader in search , last month when @entity4 announced a deal with @entity79 's @entity78			1
" they 're just trying to rapidly gain [ market ] share by doing awesome stuff , " @entity3 said of @entity79 at the @entity78 event			0
" they 're really the underdog here			0
" but @entity79 was n't spared from criticisms during tuesday 's event			0
@entity79 , a massive computer software company and an investor in @entity4 , has thousands of engineers , @entity3 pointed out ; @entity4 has fewer , and is therefore seen by developers as a more effective and attractive employer , he said			1
@entity3 makes it known that he has a soft spot for budding entrepreneurs			1
when asked about " @entity95 " -- the film based on the founding of @entity4 -- @entity3 boasted of fan mail from people who say his story inspired them to become entrepreneurs			1
his mission is to " enable others to build " social networking services , which can be accomplished using @entity4 's platform , he said			2
small - time developers can freely make use of @entity4 's offerings , but larger companies must work directly or be locked out			1
despite amassing 500 million people actively using the service , @entity3 still does n't consider @entity4 a giant company			1
" in some ways , i actually think we 're only now entering the zone where a lot of entrepreneurs will consider working with us , " he said			0
but during @entity120 ceo @entity119 's onstage interview earlier tuesday , she described @entity4 as @entity120 's " competition			2
" this sentiment could create even greater disconnects between @entity4 's service and popular apps , as is the case with @entity53 and @entity20			2
without being specific , @entity3 derided some large internet companies , saying they wo n't make it past a social networking revolution			1
" some are n't going to make it , " he said on tuesday			0
" i think there 's an exciting opportunity for some entrepreneurs			0
" @entity3 's advice to " incumbents , " as he calls technology giants : " get on the bus			0
" but that does n't mean he 's going to make it easy for them to board .			0

@entity4 ceo @entity3 favors " underdogs " and entrepreneurs
@entity11 and @entity12 have *struggled* to make apps that work well with @entity4
small companies can freely build apps that work with @entity4
