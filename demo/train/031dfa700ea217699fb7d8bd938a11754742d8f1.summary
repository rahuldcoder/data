-- @entity2 's new flagship smartphone , @entity3 , is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways			1
@entity9 is a top - notch , beautifully designed handset packed with the best specs and a ton of compelling features			1
it also runs a unique , fresh take on @entity18 's @entity17 operating system			2
and it 's available in exactly the same configuration across the three major @entity22 carriers			2
this is the phone that could close the gap between @entity2 's flagship and those from @entity28 and @entity29			1
we spent a couple of hours with the one before its big unveiling in @entity34 today , and were thoroughly impressed by the luxurious materials used on the handset , the expert build quality holding it all together , and a slew of thoughtfully crafted software features			0
although the phone carries the branding established last year with the one x , one s , and other @entity2 phones , the one amounts to a reboot of the company 's vision for @entity17			1
the one x , @entity2 's previous flagship , won critical praise , but as an @entity52 exclusive it failed to generate the sales the company had hoped for			1
" we think about the one x and we think ' wow , it was big , and it was one of the best phones we 've ever done , ' " @entity55 , @entity2 's vice president of design , said			1
" but if i were to compare it to , say , other stuff that was out there , i would n't say it was a step - change different			2
" the company set out to build a phone that could surpass , not just meet , the performance and quality of the @entity68 and @entity69			2
so it put a huge effort into nailing the @entity73 user interface , packing the phone with the best tech and broadening its reach across carriers			2
sense 4 , the previous generation of @entity2 's @entity17 customization , has been thrown out			1
every aspect of @entity73 has been rethought and redesigned			0
the result is a slick , clean user interface , full of artful icons that match the flat , understated look @entity18 has been trying to push with its own stock version of @entity17			0
and there 's a focus in the new sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive — such as sifting through social media and news apps , or snapping photos and video			2
" i think we came to this recognition that , ' wow , there are these two other companies that are going to spend a lot more money than @entity2 , ' " @entity55 said			1
" this is the reality of the business			0
they have much deeper pockets and they can carpet bomb the industry and they have a tremendous amount of inertia there , particularly with @entity28 in the @entity111 , for the one , we really had to get it right , we really had to just go for it			1
" while it 's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the one and think of the @entity68 , the one is far from a copycat product			2
it has a massive — and gorgeous — 4.7 - inch 1080p display with a pixel density of 468 pixels per inch			1
as with nearly every flagship phone out there nowadays , pixels are indiscernible on the @entity117 's generous display			1
colors look vivid and crisp as well			0
the touchscreen dominates the front of @entity3 , with aluminum capping each end			2
rows of pinholes are machined into each strip of aluminum , serving as pathways for sound coming from a set of dual front - facing speakers			2
every phone speaker we 've ever heard has sounded like hell			0
while the one wo n't replace your @entity145 anytime soon , its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we 've heard from a phone			0
inside , the one features a @entity151 , quad - core @entity149 , @entity152 of @entity153 , and @entity155 chip , @entity156 and connectivity to both @entity158 and lte networks			0
everything is packed into a sleek , aluminum unibody — shipping in either silver or black — that features a subtly curved back with inlaid antennas			0
@entity9 weighs 5.04 ounces , and is just 0.36 inches thick			1
@entity9 will also sports a beefed up camera , with a ton of photo and video features — which are so plentiful we 've written a separate story focusing on the @entity117 's camera			1
along with all new hardware , @entity2 is using the one to introduce an all new take on @entity17			1
sense 4 , @entity2 's last skin , was among the best versions of @entity18 's mobile os thanks to its simplicity and gimmick - free implementation			1
the latest version — now just called @entity73 — brings users from a lock screen to a new @entity183 - like app called @entity184 , which displays a feed of information , stories , photos and video from various sources of your choosing			0
@entity2 has worked in integration with a few news outlets , so news stories by topic or by outlet can show up in your @entity184			1
and the app can be connected to @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and other social networks as well			0
see a news story you 're interested in reading ? just tap the tile in your feed and you 're taken to a view that shows the story and its accompanying artwork in a presentation that makes reading clean and easy — again , very much like @entity183 , @entity213 , @entity214 and other " read it later " services			0
tap a tweet or post from @entity201 you 'll be launched into that corresponding social network 's @entity17 app. you can even set up @entity184 to pipe in your photos and videos			0
everything is displayed in reverse chronological order , just like your @entity200 timeline , @entity201 feed and everything else that 's sorted online			0
while @entity184 is a pre-installed app , it 's also the default view any one user will see once they unlock their phone			2
if you want to get to a traditional @entity17 homescreen view — with apps , widgets and folders of apps — just swipe in from the right on @entity184 and @entity17 as you know it will appear			0
" if you want regular @entity17 , it 's there , " @entity55 said			0
" but , everybody 's snacking on information , whether it 's from their social networks or some news source that they 're just interested in			0
so [ @entity184 ] really is geared around that recognition of how people are actually using their phones			0
" @entity52 , @entity252 and @entity253 will sell @entity3 , along with many smaller regional telecom companies			1
the significance of this ca n't be overstated			0
currently , only @entity28 's @entity68 and @entity29 's @entity69 are offered as widely			1
the @entity68 is sold through @entity52 , @entity252 and @entity257 — and it 's on it 's way to @entity253			1
the @entity69 is sold by all four of the nation 's top carriers			0
all too often , a great phone , like last year 's one x , was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones			2
the fact that the one is joining it 's biggest rivals in a new paradigm that bucks the idea of exclusive phones is a good thing for @entity2 — because they get to sell their best device in more places — and consumers — because you have more choice when you go to buy your next phone			1
