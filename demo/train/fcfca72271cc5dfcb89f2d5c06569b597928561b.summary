-- @entity4 president @entity3 on tuesday will designate nine sites in three areas of the @entity7 as marine national monuments , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity1 said monday			1
the new designated areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world			1
the new areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world -- 195,280 square miles -- and , coupled with a 138,000 - square mile designation in @entity19 two years go , mean that @entity3 will have protected more of the ocean than any other president			1
" the president 's actions will prevent the destruction and extraction of natural resources from these beautiful and biologically diverse areas without conflicting with our military 's activities and freedom of navigation , which are vital to our national security , " @entity1 said			1
" and the public and future generations will benefit from the science and knowledge gained from these areas			2
" @entity3 is using the @entity39 -- first used by president @entity40 to set aside public lands such as the @entity42 as national monuments -- for the designation			1
many of those lands later became national parks			2
@entity48 , vice president for government affairs for the non-profit @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , said @entity3 is " to be commended " for his action			1
" from a conservation history perspective , the message here is that @entity40 laid the groundwork for our national park system when he withdrew a lot of public lands and called them national monuments , " said @entity48			1
" we see the president laying the foundation for a system of national marine preserves and parks , " he said			1
" we had lacked such a system for a long time			0
" @entity51 and the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) partnered to identify eight of the nine sites the president will set aside on tuesday			0
all but one of those eight remote areas already have @entity76 refuge areas at their cores			0
" you have a core conservation mission already , " @entity48 said			0
" this is just basically going to expand them			0
" the @entity51 / @entity69 - identified sites are @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			1
@entity83 , part of @entity92 , is the smallest atoll in the world , but more than 500 fish species swim in the waters around it , and it supports 97 percent of @entity92 's seabird population			1
it is also the nesting ground for several threatened turtle species			0
the @entity101 identified the ninth site -- the waters around the northern @entity104 and the deepest ocean canyon in the world , the @entity107 , 11,033 meters ( 36,201 feet ) at its deepest			2
the new designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands , where commercial fishing will be prohibited			1
other uses of the area -- research or recreational fishing -- will be allowed but will require a permit			0
@entity3 has not gotten rave reviews for his conservation efforts on land -- according to the @entity122 , he 's signed wilderness legislation covering a little more than 2 million acres , fewer than any other president except @entity125			2
but @entity48 said that @entity3 " has really embraced ocean conservation as his own			2
" " @entity129 protection ... is lagging 50 to 100 years behind land conservation , he said			2
" this is precisely the kind of leadership that we need to get the message across that there are places in the ocean that are rich with diversity			0
" " scientists already know this , " he said			0
" they have been calling for this for 10 or 15 years			0
" the president can cut through the bureaucracy that makes protecting resources such a lengthy process , and the @entity39 is a strong tool for those efforts			0
with the act , the president can make a designation by executive order , essentially " writing the prescription for conservation " for an area , @entity48 said .			0
