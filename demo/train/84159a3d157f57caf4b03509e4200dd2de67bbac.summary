-- the @entity2 government claims he 's the mastermind of a huge online fraud operation with multiple identities and a history of breaking the law and evading arrest , but his lawyer says he 's a law - abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in @entity11			1
the question is which of these descriptions of @entity14 , the founder of the shuttered file - sharing website @entity16 , is closer to the truth ? arrested by the @entity11 police in a raid last week , @entity14 is one of seven people indicted by the @entity2 on accusations of operating an " international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works			1
" @entity16 's lawyers denied the charges , and online activists have rallied to the site 's defense			1
the arrests and the shuttering of @entity16 prompted an angry reaction from the activist hacking collective @entity34 , which took credit for temporarily crippling the @entity2 @entity36 , @entity37 and entertainment company websites after the prosecution was announced			1
dozens of supporters attended @entity14 's court hearings in @entity11 this week			1
as he sits in jail awaiting an extradition hearing in the coming months , attention has focused on the extravagant lifestyle he appears to have enjoyed			0
the @entity2 authorities say @entity16 generated more than $ 175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships			1
the @entity11 news media appear fascinated by the new international celebrity , and the government is facing questions over why it granted him residency in the country despite his criminal record			2
judge @entity60 denied @entity14 bail and offered insights into his different descriptions			2
dotcom holds one @entity66 passport , under the name of @entity14 , and two @entity69 passports , under the names of @entity14 and @entity14			2
prosecutors say the multiple passports , as well as bank accounts and credit cards from various countries linked to different names prove that @entity14 presented a flight risk			1
his lawyers have countered that @entity14 thought the @entity69 passport under the name of @entity14 had been canceled , and that the reason he had 25 credit cards in his possession at the time of his arrest was that he is a " collector " of credit cards			2
most of the cards had expired , according to the defense lawyers			0
he has prior convictions from 1998 related to computer hacking , from 2003 for insider trading in @entity66 and from 2011 for failure to disclose the number of shares he acquired in @entity95			0

his wife is pregnant with twins , and he is also the legal guardian of his wife 's two brothers ages 11 and 14			0
his lawyer , @entity108 , argued the facts demonstrate his commitment to staying in @entity11 , where he obtained residency status in december 2009			1
but prosecutors and the judge have expressed concern that if @entity14 were able to make his way to @entity66 , his @entity66 nationality would make him immune from extradition proceedings			1
in his judgment wednesday , @entity60 said he could not exclude the possibility that with his " business effectively shut down in the @entity2 and his bank accounts and assets frozen and facing prosecution on serious charges with the full weight of the @entity2 government behind it " that @entity14 " may take whatever money is still available to him and run to safe haven in @entity66			1
" the judge also expressed concern about the existence of a firearm found near @entity14 at the time of his arrest last week			2
the @entity11 police used helicopters to storm @entity14 's mansion			1
he reacted by activating a " sophisticated security lock on his bedroom door and then retreating to a second ' panic room ' hidden within his bedroom again secured by a security locked door , " according to prosecutors			0
when the police entered the inner room , they found @entity14 sitting cross-legged on the floor and " a loaded shotgun in a nearby safe			0
" @entity14 has admitted he does n't hold a firearm license but says he was intending to apply for one			0
his lawyer argued that the presence of guns on the property was a precautionary measure because his wife is from the @entity159 where the kidnapping of wealthy individuals or their children is a common occurrence			0
