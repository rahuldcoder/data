-- like any major city , @entity1 has world class museums crammed with classic art works that visitors will drop major money to see			1
being a city that has traditionally championed liberal attitudes , it 's no surprise it also hosts exhibitions dedicated to sex and drugs			1
where @entity1 excels , though , is in its extensive collections of curiosities -- museums that celebrate the engagingly odd obsessions of their curators			1
here are seven of the best : @entity21 in an ideal world there would have been a fifth @entity25 sequel in which our hero goes in search of vintage dairy produce buried deep below some ancient ruined temple			2
grabbing his treasure from its booby - trapped resting place , @entity25 would growl : " this cheese belongs in a museum , " before dashing for safety as a giant ball of @entity36 comes crashing toward him			2
the museum in question would have to be @entity1 's @entity21 , a tiny two - floor celebration of @entity44 cow creations just over the canal from the @entity46			1
exhibits are thin on the ground but there are enough free @entity36 samples to induce a bad case of the cheese sweats before you 're back on the street			0
eccentric exhibit : the world 's most expensive cheese slicer -- a diamond - encrusted tool said to be worth $ 34,000 @entity21 , 112 @entity59 ; +31 20 331 6605 the @entity60 it 's no secret that people who love cats sometimes love them slightly too much -- but they 've got nothing on @entity44 @entity66			1
when the former banker 's much - cherished mog , who went by the name of @entity72 , shuffled off to the cattery in the sky , he decided to transform his home into a shrine to his departed pet			1
the result is @entity79 -- several rooms of a well preserved 1880s canal house crammed with cat collectibles and feline - themed paintings and sketches from artists including @entity86 and @entity87			1
@entity88 continues to occupy the building 's upper stories , as do four other felines , including @entity92 , a 19 - year - old tortoiseshell cat who enjoys the attention of visitors			1
eccentric exhibit : a massive oil painting that appears to show a wizard casting spells over a giant ghostly cat			2
the @entity60 , 497 @entity101 ; +31 20 626 9040 @entity44 @entity102 it lies some distance out of the city center , but the @entity106 is worth the trip just to marvel at @entity1 's absurdly well planned suburbs			1
the museum is housed in what 's left of the former home of a cemetery director , close to the entrance of the graveyard he used to supervise			1
despite its gloomy subject matter , the @entity106 is surprisingly un-macabre , with informative and matter - of - fact displays on different @entity44 burial rituals and the paraphernalia of death			1
just as well , really , otherwise no one would want to visit the rather pleasant and airy cafe at its entrance			0
eccentric exhibit : black , square noses , designed as the grieving equivalent to a clown 's red nose			0
@entity128 , 124 @entity129 ; +31 20 694 0482 museum of bags and purses another collection crammed into a grand canal house that justifies the entrance fee almost as much as the items on display			1
this serious display of historic handbags and larger luggage starts off sedately with a selection of dainty , metallic numbers favored by royalty			0
it explodes into life with more contemporary baggage , some shaped like hats or stags			0
there are an eyebrow - raising " @entity155 " knife and gun bags designed by @entity154			1
eccentric exhibit : a pre-mobile telephone bag that features a handset , dialer and long cord to plug into the wall			0
@entity162 , 573 @entity101 ; +31 20 52464 52 @entity163 chess museum sure , there 's nothing too extraordinary about a museum exploring the checkered history of one of the world 's oldest games -- but this goes further , focusing on one single player			2
this diminutive facility on the first floor of a notorious former prison charts the life and times of @entity163 , the @entity44 ' only world chess champion			1
it 's an affectionate tribute to @entity163 , who died in 1981 , and perhaps only one for chess aficionados -- but there 's also a great chance to stick your nose into working offices based in the same building			0
there 's a giant board outside the building where you can watch talented teenagers wipe the floor with professorial old chessmen straight out of central casting			0
eccentric exhibit : a chess wall of fame featuring grandmasters such as @entity198 and @entity199			0
@entity200 , @entity201 ; +31 20 625 7017 @entity202 of @entity203 a museum for people who enjoy trying on other people 's glasses -- and let 's face it , that 's everyone			0
housed in and above a genuine optician 's shop virtually unchanged since customers first squinted through its windows in the 19th century , this shop charts 700 years of serving the shortsighted			2
once you 've viewed eyewear ranging from early owl - like nose - perchers to the chunkier frames sported by @entity221 and @entity222 , you can enter the shop and purchase your own pair			0
eccentric exhibit : masquerade masks with built - in lenses -- for those who want to recognize other people , but not be recognized			0
@entity229 , @entity230 ; +31 20 421 2414 @entity231 in a city where there 's an entire industry based around smoking certain substances , it stands to reason there 's a museum dedicated to the pipe			2
this is no novelty head shop though -- it 's a serious study of toking devices that hark back 2,500 years to the days when coughing up lumps of tar was considered healthy			0
space in this lovely 17th - century canal house is given over to pipes designed for smoking stuff stronger than a bowlful of shag -- and these are out - smoked by elaborate @entity252 fumers designed for more pedestrian fare			2
eccentric exhibit : a pipe crafted from the pincers of a crab			0
