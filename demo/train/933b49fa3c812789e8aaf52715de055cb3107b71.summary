-- @entity1 , the @entity2 's assistant director in charge , asserted thursday in a written statement that the recently arrested " @entity5 held a key position in @entity7 , comparable to a consigliere in a mob family			1
though he was @entity11 's son - in - law , @entity5 is far from a big fish in @entity7			1
@entity11 had quite a number of sons - in - law , having sired some two dozen children with five wives			1
on friday , @entity5 pleaded not guilty in federal court in downtown @entity18 to charges of conspiracy to kill @entity21			0
but the significance of @entity5 's court appearance was not that he is a big player in @entity7			2
it 's that the @entity26 administration has shipped him to @entity27 for trial rather than sending him to @entity30 to face a military commission , as has been the case with other members of @entity11 's inner circle			1
nothing in his past suggested @entity5 was suited to play any operational role within @entity7			2
before he joined @entity7 a few months before 9/11 , @entity5 had been a high school teacher in his native @entity39 ; he did n't have any experience fighting in other holy wars as most of @entity7 's leaders had			1
@entity5 took on the role of spokesman of @entity7 at the time of the 9/11 attacks , but that did n't mean that he had any operational role in them or even knew they were going to happen			2
in a private @entity7 videotape that was discovered by @entity21 forces in @entity53 after the fall of the @entity55 , @entity11 is seen gesturing at @entity5 and observing that his spokesman was not clued in on the 9/11 plans			1
@entity5 appeared in another videotape that @entity7 publicly released a month after 9/11 , sitting next to his father - in - law as @entity11 gloated about the success of the attacks			1
around the same time , @entity5 also released a tape that publicly warned " muslims in the @entity21 and @entity64 ... not to travel by plane			0
we also advise them not to live in high - rise buildings and towers			0
" a year later , @entity5 fulminated " @entity7 has the right to kill four million @entity21 , including one million children , displace double that figure , and injure and cripple hundreds and thousands			0
" but these are the words of a blowhard , not a man of action -- something that is underlined in the indictment against @entity5 that was unsealed on thursday			0
it charges him with conspiring to help @entity7 by making speeches and persuading others to join the group but makes no allegations whatsoever of involvement in any actual terror plots			0
after the fall of the @entity55 in @entity53 in the winter of 2001 , @entity5 , along with much more serious players in @entity7 such as @entity90 , the military commander of the group , fled from @entity53 to @entity92 , where they remained under some form of house arrest for around a decade			2
@entity5 's decision to leave @entity92 to travel to @entity96 led to the chain of events that resulted in him being taken in to custody by @entity21 officials in the @entity101 and then transferred to @entity27 for trial there rather than incarceration at @entity30 , @entity104			1
this is a sound decision for several reasons : first , the @entity26 administration 's stated goal is to close @entity30 , not to add prisoners there			2
second , the conviction rate since 9/11 in these kinds of terrorism cases is 100 % in @entity27 courts when it comes to allegations of any kind of involvement in @entity7 or its allied organizations			1
the @entity119 maintains a database of all the jihadist terrorism cases in the @entity21 since 9/11			0
of the 39 cases in @entity123 since 9/11 , 20 defendants pleaded guilty and 15 were convicted , while four await trial			0
by contrast , the military commission system in @entity30 is largely untested			2
the operational commander of 9/11 , @entity129 , was arrested in @entity130 a decade ago but still has yet to face trial in @entity30			2
it 's quite possible that the process may take many more years before his trial even begins			0
indeed , of the 779 prisoners who have been held at @entity30 , only six have been convicted according to a recently released study by the @entity139 , which performs research on behalf of members of @entity142			0
in other words , while courts in @entity27 have convicted alleged terrorists at a 100 % rate , less than 1 % have been successfully tried at @entity30			1
in addition , the few convictions in @entity30 have in some cases been overturned ; for instance , that of @entity150 , who was @entity11 's driver			1
in other cases , the sentences handed down have been very short compared with those in civilian trials of alleged terrorists in the @entity21 @entity159 , an @entity160 detainee at @entity30 , plea bargained his way out of the camp with time served and nine months in an @entity160 prison			0
perhaps because of his relatively minor role in @entity7 , the announcement that @entity5 will face trial in @entity18 has not produced so far any of the " not in my backyard " response we saw when the @entity26 administration announced in late 2009 that it was planning to put @entity129 on trial in @entity18			0
the political storm this unleashed forced the @entity26 administration to backtrack and to announce two years later that @entity175 instead would be tried by a military tribunal at @entity30			0
if @entity5 's case goes forward without a backlash in @entity27 and a conviction is secured , as seems all but certain , we can be sure that he will not be the last alleged member of @entity7 seized overseas who will be sent to the @entity181 to face trial -- rather than go before a military tribunal at @entity184 and all the uncertainties that such trials have hitherto encountered .			1

@entity189 says role of @entity11 's son - in - law has been *exaggerated*
he says it 's a good thing he will be tried in @entity27 , not sent to @entity30
@entity27 courts have a perfect record of convicting @entity7 members since 9/11 , he says
@entity200 : hardly anything has been accomplished by @entity30 military *panels*
