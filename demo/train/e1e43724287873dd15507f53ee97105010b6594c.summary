while @entity3 @entity2 say every option -- including a government shutdown -- is on the table to counter president @entity8 's planned executive action on immigration , @entity1 sen. - elect @entity0 said shutting down the government is something a " mature governing body " should n't even consider			1
" there 's no time , place or purpose of a government shutdown or default , " @entity0 said friday on @entity14 's @entity13			1
" that 's simply ridiculous and something that a mature governing body does n't even contemplate			2
we ought to make it very clear that that 's simply not acceptable			0
" incoming senate majority leader @entity28 has said shutting down the government or defaulting on the @entity31 's debt obligations are completely off the table			1
but @entity3 speaker @entity33 has been under pressure from the conservative faction of his caucus to tie the president 's executive actions to the fate of the government spending bill needed to fund federal agencies by mid-december			2
on friday , @entity0 , currently a member of the @entity3 , said members of @entity44 need to work together and with the president to make comprehensive immigration reform a reality			2
@entity0 said @entity2 should counter the president 's planned action with a plan of their own			1
" to simply say no to everything is unacceptable , " @entity0 said			0
" but i think the president also needs to do the right thing and work with @entity44			0
" could immigration cause another government shutdown ? asked about reports that @entity2 could consider suing the president over his coming executive order , @entity0 urged more bipartisanship , which he suggested was the message voters sent at the polls this month			1
" instead of charging each other with lawsuits or litigation or executive orders or abuses of powers , why do n't we actually do what the @entity31 people sent us to do			0
let 's work together , let 's be the grownups in the room			0
that 's what they hope that @entity77 is , " @entity0 said			1
while the midterm results appeared to bring @entity8 and @entity2 leaders in @entity44 to the table -- and in fact did as they lunched together at the @entity3 -- the spirit of bipartisanship appears to have already soured as @entity8 stood firm on his pledge to take executive action on immigration by the end of the year and following the announcement of a climate deal with @entity90 .			0

rep. @entity0 was just elected to @entity1 's @entity93 seat
he said considering a government shutdown would be " ridiculous "
the @entity31 @entity98 @entity2 leadership has not ruled out the option of a shutdown
