@entity0 -- @entity4 security forces arrested @entity5 , the @entity6 's spiritual leader , at a residential apartment in @entity0 on tuesday , state - run @entity2 reported			1
he was arrested in the @entity9 section of the capital without any resistance , @entity2 said , citing gen. @entity12 , an @entity13 spokesman			1
@entity5 , whose title is supreme guide , is accused of inciting violence , according to @entity2			1
the @entity6 picked a @entity5 deputy to temporarily replace him , its political wing said tuesday			1
@entity5 's detention came one day after 25 soldiers were killed in a @entity25 ambush and onetime ruler @entity26 won acquittal on a corruption charge			1
suspected militants armed with rocket - propelled grenades struck two buses carrying security forces and killed the soldiers in the city of @entity35 , on the border between @entity4 and @entity37 , @entity2 reported			1
interim president @entity38 declared three days of national mourning following the attack , @entity2 said			1
the @entity25 is a lawless area that was the site of frequent attacks even before @entity4 's latest round of turmoil			1
in may , for example , seven @entity4 solders were kidnapped and held for six days there , a spokesman for @entity4 's armed forces said			2
but the attack adds to the persistent tension across the country since the military ousted democratically elected president @entity54 in a coup			1
over the past week , about 900 people -- security personnel as well as citizens -- have been killed			2
deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two @entity61 sit - in sites in @entity0 on wednesday and violence raged after @entity61 supporters staged demonstrations friday			1
billions in aid on the line : what will the @entity67 do about @entity4 ? on sunday , at least 37 jailed members of the @entity6 , an @entity70 movement , were reportedly killed in what the @entity13 called an attempted jailbreak			1
@entity4 's state - run @entity74 agency reported that the prisoners died from tear - gas suffocation and from trampling over each other , and @entity4 's prosecutor @entity78 ordered the arrest monday of two police officers for their involvement in the incident			1
the prosecutor general also ordered that three police officers hospitalized for injuries sustained in the incident be held while the investigation continues			2
as for the @entity25 ambush , the @entity6 condemned the attack on @entity4 soldiers			1
" our peaceful protests ( are ) stronger than any weapon , and we do n't accept any violence , " said @entity92 , media adviser to the @entity6 's @entity93			1
@entity54 supporters , many of whom are members of the @entity6 , and those aligned with the military - backed interim government blame each other for stoking the violence			1
@entity54 has been in detention since his overthrow			2
@entity4 prosecutors have extended the detention for 15 days , pending investigations			2
prosecutors have charged him with participating in the detention , torture , murder and attempted murder of @entity4 citizens ; broadcasting false news to influence judicial authorities in their inquiries ; and inciting thugs to use force and terrorize citizens			2
questions about aid the crackdown also spurred a call from a leading @entity67 senator , @entity125 , to cut off its $ 1.3 billion in aid to @entity4			2
he said the @entity67 has failed to follow its own rule requiring suspending aid to states overtaken by a military coup -- though the @entity67 has not officially described the recent regime change in @entity4 as a coup			0
" we have no credibility			0
we do have influence , but when you do n't use that influence , then you do not have that influence , " @entity125 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity136			0
" @entity67 defense secretary @entity141 said president @entity142 noted that " every aspect " of the @entity67 - @entity4 relationship is under review			1
@entity67 - @entity4 relations : ' @entity147 if you do , damned if you do n't ' he said the @entity67 message to @entity4 officials has been consistent : the interim government should " get back to an inclusive approach to reconciliation in @entity4			2
will the regime get the message ? the @entity67 ability to influence events in @entity4 is " limited , " @entity157 said , but it 's not " without influence			0
" speaking at a @entity160 briefing with his counterpart from @entity163 , @entity157 said the @entity67 has a longstanding relationship with @entity4			0
" we have interests clearly in the @entity167 -- interests that include hopefully a development of some progress toward an @entity173 - @entity172 settlement			2
so we continue to work with the @entity4 interim government as well as the @entity4 military , " he said			0
@entity157 also said protection of @entity67 in @entity4 is of the " highest priority			0
" but @entity181 's foreign minister assured @entity4 that @entity183 nations will support @entity4 if any international aid to the country is cut , the @entity179 reported monday			0
" the @entity183 and @entity188 nation is rich when it comes to the support of its sons and its potentials and will not shy away from providing a helping hand to @entity4 , " @entity186 said			0
international response called weak , ineffective the carnage has spurred a call from leading human rights group @entity198 for a " full , impartial and effective investigation in the shocking loss of life			0
" " the interim government has already stained its human rights record -- first by breaking its promises to use nonlethal weapons to disperse @entity209 sit - ins and allow for the safe exit of wounded , and then by justifying their actions despite the tragic loss of lives , " said @entity202 , secretary - general of @entity198 , in a news release			2
" the response of the international community has been weak and ineffective , even as everyone leaps to condemn the horrific loss of life			0
the international community must act decisively to send a message that no government can behave this way and retain any credibility			0
" @entity4 demonstrator : why we are willing to die the group documented a rise in civil strife since the july 3 coup and cited " a string of serious human rights abuses , culminating in the wholesale attack by the security forces " on @entity61 sit - ins last week			1
" these abuses have included an alarming and unprecedented rise in sectarian violence against @entity238 across the country , " seemingly in retaliation for their support " for @entity54 's ouster			0
it cited abuses by @entity61 protesters " including beatings , torture and killings			0
" in recent days , the scale of violence by some @entity54 supporters have manifestly increased , as some attacked government buildings and police stations and personnel			0
some protesters have also fired live ammunition on local residents , " @entity198 said			0
@entity26 in court as the upheaval persists in @entity4 , @entity26 's court cases grind on			1
in @entity0 , a criminal court acquitted the former president in a corruption case , @entity4 state tv reported monday			1
the case stemmed from accusations of squandering public money allocated for renovating presidential palaces			0
he also faces at least one other outstanding corruption claim			0
separately , @entity26 is also facing a more serious accusation : that he was involved in the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising			1
a @entity0 court on saturday adjourned a retrial in that case to this coming sunday			1
@entity26 ruled @entity4 , the most populous @entity183 country , for three decades until demonstrators opposing his rule forced his ouster in 2011			1
he was convicted in 2012 in the deaths of numerous protesters , but was later granted a retrial			0
after a lengthy trial , he and his former interior minister , @entity285 , were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters ' killings			0
after appealing their convictions , they were granted a new trial early this year			0
@entity26 has been held since his guilty verdict last year			1
after months spent in a military hospital , a public prosecutor sent him back to prison in april			0
the ousted autocratic leader 's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration			0
