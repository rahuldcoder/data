@entity0 -- calling it an " unprecedented development , " @entity0 secretary - general ban ki - moon announced monday the @entity0 will launch a panel of inquiry to investigate the may 31 @entity8 flotilla incident that left nine @entity10 activists dead			1
" for the past two months , i have engaged in intensive consultation with the leaders of @entity15 and @entity10 on the setting - up of a panel of inquiry on the flotilla incident , " @entity11 said in a statement			1
" today i am very pleased to announce the launch of the panel			0
this is an unprecedented development			0
i thank the leaders of the two countries with whom i have engaged in last - minute consultations over the weekend , for their spirit of compromise and forward - looking cooperation			0
" the panel will be led by @entity30 , former prime minister of @entity31 , as chairman and @entity33 , outgoing @entity35 president , as vice-chair , @entity11 said			1
representatives from @entity15 and @entity10 will be the panel 's other two members			1
the panel will begin its work on august 10 and submit its first progress report by mid-september , the statement said			1
@entity11 said he hopes the panel 's work will " give me recommendations for the prevention of similar incidents in the future			0
" he said he also hopes the agreement will " impact positively on the relationship between @entity10 and @entity15 as well as the overall situation in the @entity50			1
" the @entity52 welcomed the announcement			0
@entity54 , @entity52 ambassador to the @entity0 , said the panel will receive and review reports from both @entity15 and @entity10 investigations into the incident , and issue recommendations on how such incidents can be avoided in the future			1
" the panel is not a substitute for those national investigations , " @entity62 said in a statement			0
" it complements them , affording @entity15 and @entity10 the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international community			1
" @entity15 has maintained its troops used force on the activists after they were attacked by those on board one boat in the flotilla , the @entity79			2
soldiers were attacked with knives , metal poles and other objects , @entity15 officials have said			2
but passengers on board the boat insist they were fired upon without provocation			0
the incident left a wide - ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the jewish state and @entity10 , its powerful regional ally , badly shaken and drew international outrage			2
@entity15 maintains it must inspect all goods entering @entity8 so that weapons do not get into the hands of militants			2
@entity8 is run by @entity98 , the @entity100 @entity99 movement that has said it is dedicated to the destruction of @entity15			2
@entity15 had asked the flotilla to dock at the port of @entity104 so its cargo could be inspected and transferred to @entity8 , but flotilla members refused			2
" @entity15 has nothing to hide , " @entity15 prime minister @entity107 said in a statement			1
" the opposite is true			0
it is in the national interest of the state of @entity15 to ensure that the factual truth of the overall flotilla events comes to light throughout the world , and this is exactly the principle that we are advancing			0
" @entity15 had previously resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident , but an @entity15 military investigation was conducted into the boarding of the @entity79 and it criticized some aspects of the operation			1
the operation prepared only one course of action and had no backup plan , military commanders were not presented with options other than boarding the ship , and different branches of military intelligence did not coordinate well enough , the report found			0
but the report said the commando team that boarded the ship operated properly , with bravery and professionalism , and that the use of live fire against the activists was justified			0
the @entity15 @entity143 also is conducting an ongoing investigation into the incident and is not expected to complete it for some time			0
@entity62 said the @entity52 hopes the panel " can serve as a vehicle to enable @entity15 and @entity10 to move beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties			1
