@entity0 , @entity1 -- even after months of tensions over alleged cyberattacks , the leaders of @entity4 and the @entity5 struck positive tones in a two - day summit that ended saturday in the sweltering heat of the @entity1 desert as both talked of forging a " new model " for their relations going forward			1
" we 're meeting here today to chart the future of @entity4 - @entity5 relations , " @entity4 president @entity15 said			1
" ... we need to think creatively and act energetically so that working together we can build a new model of major country relationship			0
" the summit at the @entity21 at @entity22 , just outside @entity0 , comes less than three months after @entity15 rose to his current post			1
both he and @entity5 president @entity26 pointed out their meeting is happening sooner than some expected , a testament they said to both men 's recognition of the importance of solid relations between the two countries			1
and both heads of state , who met last year in @entity35 when @entity15 was @entity4 's vice president , spoke of pursuing policies that furthers their nation 's respective interests			1
from @entity26 's perspective -- even taking into account " healthy economic competition " between the two powers -- that means seeing @entity4 continue to grow			1
" it is in the @entity5 ' interest that @entity4 continues on the path of success , because we believe that a peaceful and stable and prosperous china is not only good for @entity4 but also good for the world and for the @entity5 , " he said			1
the @entity5 president did allude to the fact " areas of tensions " are inevitable , highlighted his nation 's commitment to human rights , and its support for " an international economic order where nations are playing by the same rules			2
" " and ... the @entity5 and @entity4 ( can ) work together to address issues like cybersecurity and the protection of intellectual property , " he added			1
that comment -- tucked in the middle of @entity26 's opening remarks -- was the closest the @entity5 president got to referring to the rhetorical skirmishes of late over whether @entity5 servers and secrets have been targeted from @entity4			1
such allegations were made in a @entity74 report that points to " the @entity4 government and military " as the likely culprits of cyberintrusions in @entity5 institutions , to allegations that even the presidential campaigns of @entity82 and @entity26 were hacked by @entity4 operatives in 2012			1
beyond the broad outlines laid out by the two leaders late friday afternoon , it 's not clear exactly what the leaders will discuss over the coming days			0
but experts on @entity5 - @entity4 relations told @entity2 that they do n't expect cyberattacks will come up in direct negotiations , which occur as the @entity26 administration is on the defensive over whether it 's wrongly violated citizens ' privacy in collecting phone and online data as part of its antiterrorism strategy			1
" they both wo n't want to and wo n't be able to use this as leverage in a discussion , " said @entity102 , @entity4 expert at the @entity103			0
" they wo n't be able to say this is the pot calling the kettle black			0
" @entity110 , founder and director of the center for @entity112 at @entity113 , said the two nations have different perspectives			0
while the " @entity5 is focusing on acts of violence and terrorism , " @entity110 said , @entity4 is " utilizing the @entity116 and other mechanism in order to steal commercial or military secrets			1
" earlier this month , defense secretary @entity123 pointed to @entity4 when he addressed cybersecurity threats , telling an audience of defense professionals in @entity127 that the @entity5 was concerned about " the growing threat of cyber intrusions , some of which appear to be tied to the @entity4 government and military			2
" in an annual support on @entity4 military capabilities , the @entity74 echoed @entity137 's claim , stating that recent cyber attacks in the @entity5 appeared " to be attributable directly to @entity4 government and military			2
" @entity141 has repeatedly denied the accusations , saying that hacking is a global problem , of which @entity4 is also a victim			0
despite the fact that most experts believe the @entity5 use of monitoring is unlikely to come up , many acknowledged that if @entity26 and other @entity154 negotiators push too hard on charging the @entity4 with cyberespionage , domestic programs in the @entity5 could be used against them			1
" the potential for pushing back is there and that may force the @entity5 to take a more win - win approach , " echoed @entity156 , stating that if it does come up , it may force the @entity5 to focus on less decisive goals from the two - day summit			2
the fact is cybersecurity is just one of the many issues the two countries might address			0
one is what to do about @entity170 's nuclear program			0
another is how to address climate change			0
then there 's how to fairly boost the economies of both countries			0
meanwhile , the @entity5 public sees @entity4 as much as an ally or , at least , a " frenemy			2
" the latest @entity180 poll shows 55 % of @entity5 asked think @entity4 is either an ally ( 11 % ) or a nation friendly to the @entity5 ( 44 % ) , while 40 % say it is either unfriendly ( 26 % ) or an enemy ( 14 % )			2
for the most part , the different experts said , this weekend 's meeting will primarily be an opportunity for the two leaders to get to know one another , while also addressing major issues			0
" if these guys come out of the meeting saying , i understand this other person and this is someone i can work with " then the meeting should be considered a success , @entity102 said			0
@entity2 's @entity198 reported and wrote from @entity199 , @entity197 reported from @entity0 , and @entity200 reported from @entity35			0
@entity2 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
