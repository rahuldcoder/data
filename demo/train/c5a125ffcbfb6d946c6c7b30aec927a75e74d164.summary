-- representing " a new kind of authentic action genre , " according to co-director @entity1 , or if you prefer , the same old , same old wearing a bright , shining sales gimmick , " @entity5 " is the latest co-production between @entity7 and the @entity9 military			1
such partnerships are a propagandistic tradition that go back at least as far as @entity12 and " the @entity13			2
" @entity14 had to go to the @entity15 to get the helicopters he needed for " @entity17 , " but " @entity24 , " " transformers " and even " @entity23 " have benefited from the @entity19 's largesse in terms of hardware and expertise			0
still , @entity1 and his partner , @entity26 , ( they style themselves " the @entity29 " ) might be correct when they claim this is the first time real - life @entity32 have appeared ( incognito ) on camera in the principal roles			1
and if that is n't realistic enough for you , we 're told they used live ammunition in some of the firefights			0
there 's no official word on how many real - life terrorists were harmed in the making of this movie			1
in a brief infomercial that serves as a prologue to the main feature , @entity1 somehow keeps a straight face as he claims there is no way an actor could reproduce the emotions the real - life @entity32 feel whey they leave their wives and ship out on active duty			1
it 's not a very convincing argument -- mouse , it 's called " acting " -- and the thesis goes down in flames more or less every time one of the servicemen opens his mouth			2
anonymous guy playing @entity68 , do n't give up the day job ! too bad the @entity29 ' nose for authenticity could n't sniff out the cliches in the stale , dopey screenplay turned in by " 300 " scribe @entity74			0
the screenplay is a globe - hopping fantasy perpetuating the fashionable , paranoid myth that @entity79 drug barons are the natural allies of @entity81 terrorists			0
a single squad of @entity32 connects the dots between a school bombing in @entity85 , a kidnapping in @entity87 , covert meetings in the @entity89 and @entity90 and suicide bombers tunneling into the @entity9 from @entity92			1
everywhere you look , shady foreigners are conspiring against us			0
whatever you make of its reactionary politics , at least the action scenes are choreographed and filmed by @entity99 with a level of coherence that 's become rare in this genre -- even if the elaborate raids and skirmishes look more like a series of war games than actual combat			1
for a start , all the high - tech toys and gizmos actually work the way they 're supposed to			0
that goes for the seals too of course			0
there 's no equivalent here to the battle scene in the @entity120 war documentary " @entity126 , " in which we see even battle - hardened combat troops lose it when one of their comrades takes a lethal hit			0
there 's nothing equivalent to the @entity130 war documentary " @entity131 , " either , in which we witness @entity135 peacekeepers unthinkingly break the @entity136 by murdering enemy casualties in the heat of battle ; nor the scenes in the @entity142 - nominated documentary " to @entity146 , " in which a seriously wounded @entity9 vet struggles to get his life back together on home turf			1
that kind of authenticity is simply too hardcore for this @entity151 action movie , a recruitment commercial that ultimately does a disservice to the troops by pretending that war is just like a movie -- and not a very good one at that .			2
