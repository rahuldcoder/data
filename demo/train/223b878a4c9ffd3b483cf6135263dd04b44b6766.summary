tweet it and it may come true			0
in the world of travel , anyway			0
sending under - appreciated scribes into a frenzy of ecstasy across the @entity8 , @entity4 is launching an official residency program for writers on its long - distance routes			1
the best part ? it 's free			2
that minor earthquake you just felt was the rumble of several million freelancers scrambling for their computers			0
writers are now able to submit applications to drop everything in their lives to focus on their writing while getting gratis rides on @entity4 's most scenic routes			1
all thanks to a playful tweet from a freelance writer			0
brilliant move it 's the most positive wave of publicity @entity4 has had at least since @entity34 's last railroad rhapsody			2
the residency ball began rolling when @entity37 - based writer @entity36 tweeted a quote from @entity40 's interview with novelist @entity41			1
the writer said he 'd written his novels on trains and enjoyed doing so			0
" i wish @entity4 had residencies for writers , " @entity41 said			1
@entity36 and a friend promptly tweeted the quote at @entity4			2
in a shocking plot turn , @entity4 tweeted back : " we 'd need a test run			2
you two up for a trip to @entity53 and back ? " the stunned @entity36 quickly agreed and @entity4 soon arranged a free writing trip for her from @entity37 to @entity53 and back			1
writers nearly broke their keyboards with excitement once the news hit social media after @entity36 tweeted out about the ride at @entity4 's request			1
who knew so many writers did their best work on trains ? or like free trips ? the romance of rootlessness the next amazing chapter unfolded when @entity41 announced his own @entity4 residency			1
@entity41 says he was " blown away , absolutely amazed " by the sensation inadvertently brought about by his interview			0
" i 'll be working on my third novel , using the residency as a chance to just live inside it for four days straight , " @entity41 tells @entity73			2
" there 's a mix of anonymity and rootlessness to being on a train that makes you feel you could be anyone , anywhere -- which turns out to be excellent ground for writing fiction			0
" @entity41 's residency is scheduled for may , and will take place on a train from @entity37 to @entity90 , @entity91 , changing trains in @entity53			2
" one thing i 've been moved by are the many stories i 've since heard of , train trips that people have taken in order to just write , or even to think , " says @entity41			0
he says a friend wrote to say @entity99 at the @entity100 would take long - distance trains for the luxury of long , uninterrupted discussions on important matters			1
" i think what happened was borne out of that , even as it 's also reminded people this is a really easy , even very traditional way for them to just go off and write , " @entity41 says			0
back at @entity4 meanwhile , @entity4 's social media team has been busy			2
" it 's been an overwhelming reception , i do n't think we could ever have anticipated how quickly so many people would respond to the idea of the program , and how liberally they 're endorsing it , " says @entity110 , @entity4 's director of social media			2
but for @entity4 , what 's the upside of having writers clamoring for free rides ? " we 're always looking for unique ways to expose different audiences to our product , " says @entity122			1
@entity122 says the reaction within the company " is only positive " and that news of the program has re-kindled nostalgia for train travel among people who might not have previously considered a trip by train			0
" now we have people saying that they are doing or want to do their own versions of the @entity4 residency , " she says			1
" there 's something very romantic about train travel			0
" program details @entity4 unveiled the official application process on saturday			2
up to 24 writers will be chosen for residencies , which will only take place on undersold long - distance routes			1
each residency will include accommodation on a sleeper car with all a writer really needs : a bed , a desk and outlets			1
applications will be judged on a year - round basis by a panel of @entity4 executives and outside writers			1
because travelers tend to book longer routes earlier , it 's easier for @entity4 to predict which routes will have the vacancies they can grant to resident writers , says @entity122			1
residents wo n't be obliged to write about or mention @entity4 in their work , nor will they be expected to turn in any writing to the company after their trips			2
@entity122 says @entity4 has concluded that the organic social - media buzz created by the residency program provides enough of a return on investment			1
all residencies will take place over two - to - five days on 15 long - distance routes , and will be free			1
creating a personalized # @entity177 as @entity4 was formalizing its residency application process , @entity122 shared a few of the company 's picks for best routes for writers to get cracking on the next great @entity8 novel			1
" someone writing about food could do the long - distance trip from @entity53 to @entity189 , via @entity190 , doing a huge foodie tour with a lot of little stops , for example , " says @entity122			1
here are three more writing - trips suggested by @entity4 and fleshed out by wistful editors stuck in offices			1
@entity199 ( @entity53 to @entity90 / @entity200 ) from the train writers can ponder the @entity202 and imagine sharing the same writing space as @entity205 bard @entity204 as they chug past the glowing night skyline of @entity207 and @entity208			0
the next morning , the stark @entity210 plains and @entity212 country in @entity213 provide an atmosphere suited to contemplative procrastination			0
from @entity217 , @entity218 , writers can pick their bohemian finale by continuing to @entity200 or head down the @entity220 to @entity90 , @entity91			0
in either end point , they 'll be in their element , surrounded by freelance writers highly motivated for freebies			0
@entity225 ( @entity53 to @entity227 / @entity226 ) the @entity225 plies one of the most beautiful train routes in @entity230			0
crossing through the plains of @entity232 to @entity233 gives writers ample time to begin thinking about what a rough outline might eventually look like			0
baby steps ... then happy hour ! ( is @entity4 aware this is how writers work ? ) climbing through the heart of the @entity242 , and then the snow - capped @entity243 , may ennoble the stout of word , but the outstanding views might distract less self - disciplined writers			1
the rhythm of the rails is intoxicating , indeed , but beware , loquacious scribblers , for it also induces a state of somnambulant torpor from which even the combined forces of @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 may not rescue you			0
@entity259 ( @entity53 to @entity260 ) the chief rumbles across eight states , passing wheat fields , ranches , missions , pueblos , mountains , canyons and deserts			0
what scenery could be better to gaze at out a window while pondering future royalties and which outfit to wear for your first interview with @entity276 ?			0
