-- an entire nation stopped sunday			0
four million people sat watching on their television , hearts palpitating with every movement			0
another 40,000 packed into @entity7 with just one hope			2
amidst the roars , step forward @entity10 , the 23 - year - old with the weight of all @entity12 on his shoulders			1
for two weeks the @entity12 public had watched and waited for @entity10 to deliver that moment of magic , that performance which would go down in folklore			1
on sunday , faced with his last chance of chance of glory , the home favorite delivered , sealing victory in the men 's slalom to spark scenes of wild celebration			1
the 23 - year - old came home in an aggregate of 1min 51.03 seconds , 0.42 seconds ahead of @entity33 's @entity32 , with fellow @entity12 and former two - time world champion @entity34 , claiming bronze at 0.65 seconds			1
" it was very difficult , " @entity10 told reporters			2
what can i say , it 's great			0
" the atmosphere was sensational , it was great			0
but i was so focused and just tried not to make a mess			0
it was anything but easy			0
" @entity10 said the lead up to the slalom had been " the toughest week in my life so far "			1
" the whole country was watching me , especially for the slalom			0
around four million people were watching on television in @entity12 and 40,000 are here live in the stadium			2
if i 'd straddled , oh my god , they 're going to kill me ! " it 's definitely good to be the world champion here in my home country			0
" with the cowbells greeting his victorious arrival at the finish line , @entity10 soaked up the adulation in front of an adoring crowd			2
but while @entity10 was left to reflect on his victory , @entity66 star @entity65 's bid to win a fourth gold at the championships was ended following an uncharacteristic error			1
@entity65 , who had won gold in the super-g , super-combined and giant slalom , was the first man to achieve such a feat since @entity76 in 1968			1
but his failure around a gate and the sight of his skis breaking free , ended @entity65 's attempt to make history			1
while @entity65 failed , @entity33 's @entity32 had no such problems , claiming silver			1
