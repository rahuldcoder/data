-- @entity1 has been in show business for 60 years -- but it 's only now , with her performance in the film " @entity6 , " that she is getting wide recognition			1
it 's not often a role gives an older woman an opportunity to say the f - word and lift up her skirts at a cemetery -- and leads to an @entity17 nomination for best supporting actress			1
5 things we learned from the @entity17 nominations as @entity22 in " @entity6 , " @entity1 is the blunt , put - upon wife of @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , a cantankerous former auto mechanic who 's convinced he 's won a million - dollar sweepstakes			1
it 's a role that could have been played for one - dimensional laughs , but @entity30 's performance brings out both @entity22 's hard edges and protective heart -- for her sons , who run interference for @entity24 , and for @entity24 himself			1
director @entity36 was n't surprised			2
" it 's called being a pro , " he told @entity37			1
@entity1 had also appeared in @entity36 's " @entity39 " as @entity41 's wife , who dies early in the film			1
@entity1 said she 's thrilled with the attention but has had plenty of time to prepare			1
" i 've gone through being discovered an awful lot of times in @entity48 on stage , and even some of the films i 've made , " she told @entity0			1
she 's been at this acting thing for a while , with regular appearances in the theater , in small movie roles and on television			1
her late husband , @entity58 , was an acting teacher			1
their son , @entity59 , is a filmmaker			2
she even played on the silliness of @entity17 campaigning in a video for " @entity65			2
" " @entity6 " was released on dvd and blu - ray on tuesday			1
@entity1 spoke with @entity0 about the film , her newfound fame and the @entity17 nod			1
the following is an edited version of the interview : @entity0 : so what 's it like , being an overnight success at 84 ? @entity1 : it 's different , @entity78 knows -- and i certainly was never nominated for an @entity17 before -- but it 's fun			1
i 'm enjoying it tremendously			2
@entity0 : tell me how this came about			2
you had a small role in " @entity39			2
" squibb : ( for ) " @entity39 " they did n't know me , and they were looking far and wide , and finally they accepted a tape from @entity48			2
( @entity36 ) said , the minute he saw the tape he knew that 's what he wanted for " @entity39			1
" so 10 years have gone by , and again he was looking for this woman 's role , and he told me he thought i was n't right for it			1
he thought i was that sweet little lady from " about @entity39			2
" but his office asked if i would take the script and read two scenes on tape for him , and i did			2
and he said when he saw the tape , he knew this was it			0
@entity0 : what is an @entity36 shoot like ? squibb : it 's very relaxed because he 's relaxed			1
he basically comes into it knowing what he wants , and if he does n't , he might even tell you			0
in one instance , when i was telling off the family with the f - word , he said to me , i do n't know what i want			0
so we tried it all different ways			0
and he does understand how an actor works			0
he understands what we have to go through to get somewhere			0
@entity0 : how did you approach portraying the wife ? she starts out as almost dismissive of what seems like a no - good husband , and then you realize how deep and firm their passion and relationship is			0
squibb : i did n't think that out so much			0
i think the way i work is each scene and deal with it as what that scene is			1
i never really thought in terms of the trip , because i was taking it			0
@entity0 : were there any scenes that were difficult for you to do , like lifting up your skirts in the cemetery ? ( in that scene , @entity1 's character mocks a former boyfriend by pulling up her skirt to show his gravestone what he missed			1
) squibb : the cemetery is the first scene that i shot			0
when i found that out , i screamed , " @entity36 ! this is hard ! " and he said , " no , we 're doing it first , and it 'll be fine			0
" and of course it was			0
we had a good time and it was fun to shoot			0
i think he got what he wanted from it			0
the first day on set is always a little nervous - making , no matter how much you 've worked or who you worked with			0
@entity0 : did you always want to be an actress ? squibb : it was never a question of wanting			1
i always thought of myself as i am an actress			1
i went from @entity165 to the @entity166 and worked there for five years			2
and i went to @entity48 from there			0
... i went there in ' 56 , and i was on @entity168 by ' 59			0
i think i did five @entity168 shows while i was there			0
i did everything -- off - @entity168 , stock , anything you can possibly do			0
@entity0 : has the acting life been all it 's cracked up to be ? squibb : it 's been a wonderful life			1
of course , it 's difficult -- it 's probably the hardest career you could ever pick			2
but i 've had a wonderful career ; i 've really worked a lot			0
i went to @entity48 and started working right away			0
so i was one of the lucky ones in that respect .			0
