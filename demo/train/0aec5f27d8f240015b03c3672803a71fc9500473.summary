a mother forced to drown her own baby and a prison camp inmate compelled to eat rodents and lizards just to survive -- these are some of the horrific experiences documented by a @entity8 inquiry into human rights violations in @entity10			1
according to the man who headed up the study , examples of " unspeakable atrocities " collected to date suggest widespread abuses on a scale requiring an international response			2
" what we have seen and heard so far -- the specificity , detail and shocking character of the personal testimony -- appears without doubt to demand follow - up action by the world community , and accountability on behalf of the @entity10 , " @entity18 , chair of the three - member commission of inquiry , told the @entity8 's @entity22 tuesday			1
the remarks were contained in a draft report updating the council on the work of the commission , ahead of a final report to the @entity38 slated for march			0
@entity39 has refused to cooperate with the investigation and rejects its validity			0
@entity18 said the interim findings were based on testimony given at public hearings in @entity45 and @entity46 last month , from sources including @entity10 defectors , former regime officials , survivors of political prison camps , and the families of @entity53 and @entity54 abducted by @entity10 agents			2
" the individual testimonies emerging from the public hearings , of which these are just instances , do not represent isolated cases , " he said			0
" they are representative of large - scale patterns that may constitute systematic and gross human rights violations			1

" one woman had given an account of witnessing a female inmate forced to drown her own baby in a bucket , while a man had spoken of being forced to burn the corpses of many prisoners who had died of starvation , before scattering their remains on crops			0
" the commission listened to political prison camp survivors who suffered through childhoods of starvation and unspeakable atrocities , as a product of the ' guilt by association ' practice , punishing other generations for a family member 's perceived views or affiliation , " he said , referring to the account of @entity87 , the high - profile @entity10 defector whose horrific experiences were documented in the biography " escape from @entity93			1
imprisoned from birth , he said , @entity109 had eaten " rodents , lizards and grass to survive , and witness ( ed ) the public execution of his mother and brother			0
" @entity18 also referred to the testimony given by the parents of @entity119 , a 13 - year - old @entity53 girl who was abducted by @entity10 agents on her way home from school in 1977			0
@entity119 was one of 13 @entity53 kidnapped by @entity10 and held in a @entity10 facility as a way of training spies ; the regime has said that she and seven others are dead			0
international attention on @entity10 has previously focused on halting its nuclear weapons program , but , in response to increasingly detailed reports of human rights abuses emerging from the isolated state , the @entity8 's @entity22 elected in march to establish the commission			1
human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps in @entity10 , as part of a system to crush political dissent			1

@entity10 had stonewalled invitations to participate in the inquiry , he said , with its official news agency rejecting the testimony as " slander " put forward by " human scum , " he said			1
he said the commission would seek to identify which @entity10 institutions and officials were responsible for gross human rights violations , but did not clarify the mechanisms through which any prosecutions might occur			1
@entity10 is not a member of the @entity174 , but the court is empowered to investigate potential abuse by non-signatories at the request of the @entity179 .			0
