-- on the topic of tv shows getting a second life , it 's impossible not to look to @entity5 , the original model for @entity9 fans ' cheer of " six seasons and a movie			1
" after six fashionable years of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity18 's adventures on tv , the iconic @entity13 comedy series found new life — twice — with two big - screen adaptations , both written and directed by series exec producer @entity22			1
during our chat with @entity22 about the revival chances of his other @entity13 show , @entity29 , the conversation of course veered into @entity5 territory			1
( how could it not ? ) the big question : could a third @entity5 movie ever get off the ground ? back in january , @entity35 told @entity36 that she believed there was one last chapter to tell			1
" the great gift or riches or luck is that i worked on two shows that were so full that they spilled over into people 's lives and the characters were rounded enough that you could still wonder where they are , " @entity22 says , adding that @entity5 is still thriving on tv , especially as alternative programming ( @entity13 marathoned the series on @entity42 )			1
@entity0 : should there be a ' @entity5 3 ' movie ? acknowledging @entity57 's comments on a third film , @entity22 explains , " @entity35 and i both know what that final chapter is			1
that does n't mean it will or should be told , but i do think there 's one story left			1
whether it ever happens is a whole other situation			2
but there 's four girls , and those girls are still in my mind			2
there are other stories to tell and characters that have n't even been written yet			2
" the show went off the air exactly 10 years ago , in february 2004 , delivering series - high ratings for the emotional finale			1
four years later , @entity5 hit movie theaters and raked in $ 152 million at the domestic box office , with critical reviews split right down the middle			2
@entity83 opened with significantly less ballyhoo in 2010 and made $ 95 million at home , with the @entity87 score at just 15 %			2
if it seemed as though the series was on its last legs , that would largely be the accurate assumption — but it depends who you 're asking			2
@entity0 's @entity96 sees a future			2
the series still lives online , boasting 14 million devotees on @entity100 and plenty of meme life among the @entity104 generation			0
the clamor for another movie might not be as loud as it once was , but rest assured , it 's still there			0
" it 's a very interesting balance of zeitgeist and letting go and coming back and figuring out if you 're done or you 're not done			0
i listen to people a lot , actually , " says @entity22			0
" what i do know is that there 's interest , but with interest comes non-interest			0
it 's all really about the stories , and if you actually think you have something left to say that would make it exciting and worthwhile for the fans ' time , that 's really the question			0
not whether you can get away with it , not whether anybody will buy it , not whether you can make money on it			0
it 's really like , is there enough or more to say that would justify people risking seeing their favorite characters again ? and i think there 's one chapter left			1
" @entity0 : @entity22 talks the future of ' @entity29 ' the first and perhaps biggest hurdle would be convincing all the women to return , and as it stands , it 's just @entity145 who seemed to be uninterested about the idea ( although that was in 2012 , and it sounds like things may have changed )			0
@entity57 , as we know , believes in a third story ; @entity152 is excited at the possibility , and @entity154 appears to be on board as well			0
with attitudes in the affirmative , the question falls to whether enough of the moving parts can assemble to get a greenlight for a second sequel			1
@entity22 is realistic that a third @entity5 venture may in fact never come to fruition , but fans should be pleased to know that he and @entity35 are on the same page when it comes to finishing the saga with one final story			1
although , it should be clear , though @entity22 listens to the rumblings about @entity5 's place in the zeitgeist , he 's not exactly flocking to @entity104 or @entity173 ( where accounts are devoted to the plots of a third movie ) to take suggestions			1
" oh , like i would ever look at the @entity178 ! " jokes @entity22			0
" i also sometimes go into the kitchen and just turn on the stove and put my hand on it to see if that hurts still			0
