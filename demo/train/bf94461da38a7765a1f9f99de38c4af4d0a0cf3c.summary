-- oh sure , @entity2 's new @entity1 is made of composite materials and it 's super fuel efficient , but unless you own an airline , the only thing you care about is how comfortable it is			1
@entity2 knows this , and has striven to give passengers an experience unlike any other airplane			1
the aerospace company decided an all - new airplane needs an all - new interior and went all - out to make the 787 's interior as innovative as its airframe , aerodynamics and engines			1
from the air you breath to the turbulence you ( wo n't ) feel to the windows you look through , the passenger experience promises to provide something new at every stage of your flight			1
" when you go inside a 787 mockup , you get this ' wow ! ' " said airline analyst @entity28 , who got to see a demo interior at @entity2 's facility near @entity31			1
you know the 787 is something different the moment you step inside			1
@entity2 wastes no time giving passengers a new experience			1
as soon as you board the @entity1 , you 're greeted by an open area just inside the door			1
the ceiling resembles a skylight , complete with blue led lighting that mimics the sky			1
" they 've designed this kind of lounge area instead of coming in next to a galley , " @entity28 says			0
" it really gives you a welcoming area instead of entering into somebody 's kitchen			2
" of course , it 's up to the airlines buying the planes to decide what you see , and some of them may well modify the boarding area and other features of the plane			1
but even if they muck it up completely , there 's still a lot of " wow " in the 787 cabin			1
the onboard lighting is one of the coolest features			1
anyone who has flown across more than a couple of time zones knows how difficult it is to sleep , and to be awakened with the flick of a switch that floods the cabin in fluorescent white light			0
@entity2 's leds allow the crew to adjust the lighting to match different phases of the flight			1
the light is fairly standard during boarding and while cruising			0
during meals it is adjusted to warmer tones			0
once you 're done eating and want to tilt the seat back and relax , the cabin can be bathed in a relaxing lavender hue			0
when it 's time to sleep , the lights are turned way down			2
but it 's how the crew wakes you that 's the best part of the @entity1 's lighting			1
instead of flicking the lights on and flooding the cabin in light , the cabin will brighten slowly , with the light transitioning from the purples and oranges of a sunrise to yellows , and eventually white against a blue sky			0
@entity2 's thought is mimicking the light schedule of your destination , some of the dreaded jet lag can be alleviated sleep time brings up another innovation			2
gone is that dreaded moment when , after you finally fall asleep , that passenger in the window seat raises the shade to make sure the @entity122 is still there and fills the cabin with sunlight			2
the windows of the @entity1 do n't have shades			1
they use an electrochromic dimmable system			0
you can let in all the light you want -- or none at all -- at the flick of a switch			0
of course , the crew has a master switch , so when it 's time to sleep , that guy in the window seat can only get just enough light to confirm the @entity122 has n't gone anywhere without bothering everybody else			2
he 'll have a better view , too			0
the 787 's windows are 65 percent bigger than the windows in other planes			1
@entity2 made them taller , so kids and @entity147 players can enjoy the same view as the average passenger			2
@entity2 spent a lot of time focusing on how passengers perceive the cabin			2
let 's face it : you 're sitting in a tube			2
it 's only so big -- the fuselage is 18 feet 11 inches wide -- and there 's only so much space you can use			2
things are always a little more spacious in first class , but @entity2 wanted to make sure even those of us crammed into coach feel like we have more room			0
to do that , @entity2 's designers gave the 787 an open , airy design			1
it 's another reason for the skylight - like lighting			1
" the upper ceiling designs are arched in such a fashion that you get a much more open feeling than you do in a typical wide - body airplane , " @entity28 says			2
even the overhead bins have been redesigned			0
to accommodate the trend of more carry - on bags due to baggage fees and the unwillingness of some passengers to part with their luggage , @entity2 made the bins about 30 percent bigger			1
they 're easier to load because they lower when opened and tuck away when raised			0
that should be a big help for people who do n't understand what a carry - on should be and make it easier for the rest of us to stash our stuff and get out of the aisle			2
the composite structure of the 787 means the @entity1 is lighter and more aerodynamic , which is a boon for airlines			1
but the composite construction means the airframe is n't prone to corrosion like aluminum			0
that means the crew can increase the humidity of the cabin , reducing that parched feeling you have after a long flight			2
and thanks again to the composite fuselage , the interior cabin pressure can be increased			0
this means the cabin will be pressurized to an altitude of 6,000 feet instead of the typical 8,000 feet			0
these combined factors should make breathing much more comfortable and lead to fewer headaches , fatigue and other health issues common to many passengers			2
another factor that often leads to headaches and general annoyance is noise , especially if you 're sitting behind the engines			0
the new serrated engine nacelles on the 787 make the plane quieter -- both for passengers and those who live in the plane 's flight path			1
even the fan blades inside the engine are designed to be quieter			0
one of the more innovative passenger comfort systems on the @entity1 is the computer - controlled turbulence - reduction system			1
@entity2 claims the @entity237 will provide an eight-fold reduction in the number of people experiencing motion sickness			0
sensors throughout the airplane detect subtle changes in air pressure indicative of turbulence and direct the fly - by - wire flight controls to move flaperons on the wings to counter the vertical motion			1
it wo n't eliminate all the bumps , but @entity2 says it will work especially well on the moderate turbulence that causes most airsickness			2
all of this technology puts the 787 well ahead of the competition , @entity28 says			0
he points out that if you only know the standard airline interior , you wo n't feel like you 're missing anything			0
but even the most modern of interiors in other airplanes does n't compare			0
" @entity263 had done a complete makeover of the @entity265 in 2007 , " @entity28 says			0
" but it 's a conventional looking interior			0
it 's very good , but having been inside the 787 , you just get that ' wow ' factor			1
" and the new interiors will make the airlines happy as well			0
from the windows to the bathrooms and everything in between , the 787 interior is designed to be easier to clean and cheaper to repair or replace			1
the @entity1 is two years overdue and @entity2 has lost orders because of those delays			1
but @entity28 and others say once the flight test is finished and the first loads of passengers have flown on the new airplane , most of the bad memories should be erased			0
he says there are likely to be a few more hiccups between now and then , but is confident both the airlines and the flying public will appreciate the new design			1
" @entity2 is going to have a real winner on its hands , " he says			0
we 'll find out in nine months			0
that 's when @entity295 's @entity294 starts service with the first passenger carrying 787			1

long - awaiting @entity1 promises to " wow " passengers , analyst says
innovative lighting , airy quality , bigger windows , less turbulence among 787 benefits
airlines may modify features after buying planes , but public should still be *pleased*
in nine months , @entity295 's @entity294 will start first 787 passenger flights
