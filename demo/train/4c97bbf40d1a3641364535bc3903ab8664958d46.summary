-- your daughter 's favorite doll is lost , and she wo n't stop crying			0
what if you could replace it in 20 minutes ? your spatula breaks in the middle of dinner prep			0
why not just whip up a new one ? believe it or not , this stuff is possible			0
we are in the middle of a self - manufacturing revolution , thanks to innovations in @entity17 printing			1
@entity17 printers have been around for years , but only now are they finally becoming more affordable for the general public			1
while more popular printers such as the @entity22 have been known to cost more than $ 1,000 , the @entity20 is a new 3 - d printer that successfully reached its goal on crowd - funding site @entity25 this year and will be available for consumer purchase this fall for under $ 400			1
that 's less than some iphones			0
not only are @entity17 printers more affordable , but they are getting even better at printing , too			1
many are starting to accommodate materials other than the standard plastic filament , enabling @entity17 experimenters to print with wood , metals , cookie dough and more			2
these advancements are making it easy and fun to use 3 - d printers to create everyday products , such as home decor , jewelry , toys and even running shoes			1
can you envision a future @entity47 where you print all your gifts instead of shop for them ? it could soon be reality in even the most tech - averse household , and it might just end up saving the craftier among us lots of time and money			2
why buy a $ 50 vase when you can print one for $ 2 ? purchasing new cookie cutters seems silly once you realize you can customize your own online and print them in 15 minutes			0
you can even turn sentimental photos into @entity17 printed goods , making for a personalized gift on birthdays and anniversaries			1
so how do these printers work ? first , you 'll need to install a software program onto your computer that can configure the @entity17 file for whatever you are going to print			1
creating 3 - d files can be as easy or as complex as you like			0
you can either download free @entity17 designs from various websites ( such as @entity73 ) and send them straight to print , download a basic @entity17 design that you can then tweak with slight customizations or use @entity17 modeling software such as @entity77 to create your designs from scratch			2
new gadgets such as the @entity81 can even take a 360 - degree scan of any product you may already have in your home , then convert it into a 3 - d design so that you can clone it with your @entity17 printer			1
this is a great way to replace objects that might be worn or slightly broken			0
once your printer receives the @entity17 file , it begins printing , first left to right ( just like with your inkjet ) , then upward to build a third dimension			1
you have a cartridge for your plastic just like you have one for your ink on a standard home printer			0
if you are n't yet ready to own a @entity17 printer , you can still start @entity17 printing without one			1
new companies such as @entity101 enable you to upload @entity17 designs or browse among a marketplace of products from other designers , then print the goods for you and ship them to your home			2
or if you 'd like to try a whole new 3 - d printing concept in general , sign up to be one of the first to demo the @entity110 , a pen that lets you draw products into reality			2
one of the coolest parts of this new industry is just how customizable printed products can be			0
a @entity118 company called @entity119 can turn a quick scan of your body into a @entity17 gummy bear - like version of yourself			1
or you can use the same technology to create a mini-action figure of yourself			0
think of all the possibilities for children to have their own toys replicated after themselves , or for brides and grooms to have the ultimate custom cake topper			0
" if you can think it , you can print it " might just be the new saying of our time .			0
