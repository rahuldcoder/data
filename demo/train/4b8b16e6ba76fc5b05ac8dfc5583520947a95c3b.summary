the city manager of @entity12 said sunday he would not allow @entity5 to be buried in the city if requested by the funeral director or @entity5 's family			1

" everyone deserves to be buried , " @entity54 said			0
the marathon bombings authorities say the brothers carried out the @entity104 bombings using explosive devices made with pressure cookers			0

he is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head , neck , legs and hands that he received in the shootout with police that led to his brother 's death			2
other target , possible cover - up the marathon was not the original target , the law enforcement officials said			0
the brothers had set their sights on a suicide attack on the city 's massive @entity221 celebration , which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally			2
but the bombs were ready sooner than anticipated , and a day or two before the @entity104 , they changed their plans , the officials said			0
they spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media			0
