-- the @entity1 is an exceptional nation			1
as a people , we are not bound by blood , nationality , ethnicity or religion			0
instead , we are connected by the core belief that it does not matter where you came from ; it matters only where you are going			0
this belief is what makes our country unique			0
it is also what makes education critically important , more so today than ever			2
while our political leanings may be different , our careers have taught us that education is inextricably linked to the strength of this country and our leadership in the international community			2
today , globalization and the technological sophistication of our economy are widening already troubling socioeconomic disparities , rewarding those who acquire the right skills and punishing brutally those who do not			0
it is not hyperbole to say that the state of education in our country is a challenge to our national security			1
human capital has never been more important for success in our increasingly competitive world economy			1
yet , although the @entity1 invests more in education than almost any other developed nation , its students rank in the middle of the pack in reading and toward the bottom in math and science			1
on average , @entity1 students have fallen behind peers in @entity50 and @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 and @entity54			2
this puts us on a trajectory toward massive failure			0
our schools simply must do better			0
it is essential , too , that we provide a base of knowledge for our students in order to produce citizens who can serve in the @entity65 , the intelligence community and the armed forces			2
the @entity69 is struggling to recruit enough foreign language speakers , @entity1 generals are cautioning that enlistees can not read training manuals for sophisticated equipment , and a report from the @entity75 in @entity76 found that out of 250 intelligence personnel , fewer than five had the " aptitude to put pieces together to form a conclusion			2
" @entity82 blog : report calls education a national security issue for the @entity1 to maintain its role of military and diplomatic leadership , it needs highly qualified and capable men and women to conduct its foreign affairs			1
knowledge of the world and of foreign languages is essential			1
finally , we must also foster a deeper understanding of @entity1 's core institutions and values			1
successfully educating our young people about our country , its governmental institutions and values — what is sometimes called " civics " — is crucial to our coherence as a population and for informed citizenry			2
a year ago , we brought together leaders in education , politics , business , academia and the armed forces and diplomatic communities to assess the nation 's educational challenges in the context of national security			1
we believe education is posing direct threats to our nation : to economic growth , to intellectual property and competitiveness , to the protection of @entity1 physical safety and to @entity1 global awareness , unity and cohesion			1
based on our consultations with these leaders , we offer three recommendations that build upon our core @entity1 strengths and the work already under way in schools , districts and states across the nation			1
@entity1 must compete successfully globally , but reform must have a distinctly @entity1 character , tapping our creativity , capacity for innovation and the power of competition			0
our recommendations are as follows : implement educational expectations and assessments in subjects vital to protecting national security			1
states should expand the @entity152 and implement assessments that more meaningfully measure student achievement			0
children in every state must have strong foundations in science , technology , and foreign language , and skills like creative thinking and problem solving if they are to be competitive nationally and globally			0
make structural changes to provide all students with meaningful choices			0
states and school districts should give parents a much wider range of educational options so children are not trapped in failing schools			0
choice is especially important for poor parents who are more likely to live in districts with underperforming schools ; mobility gives these children vital options			0
enhanced choice and competition among schools , in an environment of equitable resource allocation , will fuel the innovation necessary to transform results			0
launch a " national security readiness audit " to hold schools and policymakers accountable for results and to raise public awareness			1
we need a stronger and more coordinated effort to assess school - level information — from basic educational outcomes , like the proportion of students passing courses and graduating from high school to specific national security - related skills , such as mastering foreign languages and computer skills			1
@entity1 's greatest strengths stem from the freedom to innovate , create , compete and succeed			1
without a wide base of educated and capable citizens , our strengths will fade , and the @entity1 will lose its capacity to lead in the international community			0
we embarked on this project because we believe the crucial question for our generation is whether , on our watch , the @entity1 dream becomes the @entity1 memory			2
we hope and believe that if the country refocuses and reprioritizes , the @entity212 can be sustained for future generations			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 and @entity221 .			2

@entity221 and @entity220 : education essential to @entity1 's strength , yet nation lags
they say education also *key* to national security ; human capital important in world competitivess
they say knowledge of the world , @entity1 civics , foreign languages crucial for leadership
*writers* : @entity1 must expand core standards , offer school choice , teach languages , computer skills
