-- urban transport in @entity3 's administrative capital of @entity4 has always been about what goes up and down			1
situated in a deep canyon more than 10,000 feet above sea level , the @entity7 metropolis is one of the highest cities in the world			0
densely populated barrios ( neighborhoods ) occupy the hills encompassing the bustling city center , rising a further 1,400 feet towards the satellite town of @entity18			2
while these lofty locations create a dramatic setting -- particularly at night when the slopes are illuminated by thousands of house and street lights -- servicing them with reliable transit services has long proven difficult			0
bus journeys that are only a few miles long can often take up to an hour during busy periods as heavy traffic clogs the city 's steep and narrow streets			1
see also : @entity31 link @entity32 and @entity33 come the second half of 2014 , however , an all - new system of mass transportation is set to reduce the burden on these chaotic roadways			1
the @entity4 urban gondola will consist of three separate service lines stretching across a combined 10.7 kilometer ( 6.1 mile ) area of the city			1
these giant structures , most commonly associated with ski - resorts or mountaintop tourist spots , will cater for a combined hourly capacity of 9,000 passengers and come in at a reported cost of $ 235 million dollars			2
with individual pods traveling at a speed of 18 kilometers per hour ( 11 mph ) , the gondola aims to offer a transit system many times faster than more traditional modes of city transportation			1
as it currently stands , " one person coming in the morning from @entity18 to the south area spends between one and a half and two hours to reach his destination , " explained @entity55 , ceo of @entity3 , the company behind the project			2
with the gondola , this same journey will " take 24 minutes			2
" " the capacity may be lower when compared to a metro line or a railway but these options are not suitable on these slopes , " he added			0
" they are also much cheaper and cause less disruption during the building process as they can be built in a straight line and take up a fraction of the space that a road or railway line would require			2
" socio - economic benefits these sentiments were echoed by @entity82 , a designer from innovation firm @entity83 and advocate of an urban gondola for @entity86 , @entity87 , in an interview with marketplace earlier this year			1
he estimated that the cost of building a gondola comes in at between $ 3 million and $ 12 million per mile , comparing favorably against $ 400 million per mile for subway systems and $ 36 million per mile for light rail systems			2

@entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 have all introduced similar systems in recent years			1
when these projects have been successful , they have brought with them a wide range of social and economic benefits			0
@entity103 's @entity111 , which connects some of the city 's poorest districts with its main metro line , was even recognized as a key factor in the @entity117 city winning the prestigious @entity119 ' award in early 2013			1
marketing executive at @entity3 , @entity121 , meanwhile speaks of private compliments the company received from @entity125 officials regarding the @entity127 " project and how it has " increased economic opportunity " as well as " lowered crime rates " in many poorer and previously disconnected areas where stations are located			1
bridging urban islands for @entity134 , founder of the @entity136 based website , @entity137 , these observations speak to the wider benefits of gondolas when introduced into the right type of urban environment			2
" being able to connect people from an island , which is what these barrios often are , to the wider city where they can access economic , social and cultural opportunities , that 's the real value , " @entity134 said			1
" you would n't have been able to do it in certain places without a cable car " due to the various building and topographical challenges , he added			0
see also : could drones be the new highways ? such positive social outcomes have got other cities around the world thinking about their own transport needs and the potential benefits urban gondolas can bring			0
projects are reportedly in the works in the likes of @entity167 in @entity168 and the city of @entity170 in @entity171 , according to @entity137			0
whether these ventures meet with the same success however is far from certain			0
the @entity175 legacy many skeptics point to the " cable car " system built in @entity175 to connect the @entity178 and the @entity179 across the @entity180 during the @entity181 as an example of an urban gondola project gone wrong			1
although used by large numbers of people during the @entity188 , passenger numbers today are a fraction of what they were when the facility first opened , according to figures provided to @entity0 by local politicians			0
the surrounding area is connected to major tube and light railway transport routes but is not home to a large residential population that would have any practical need to use the structure frequently , explained @entity203 member , @entity202			0
" it 's a nice bit of tourist infrastructure but it 's not a serious mass transit solution in this part of @entity175 , " @entity202 said			1
" it has an annual operating cost which is a six figure sum			0
this is massively greater than the revenue from fares income			0
" see also : 8 spectacular infrastructure projects although critical of the @entity175 project , @entity202 believes the gondola concept itself can still offer a valuable urban transit option if constructed in locations where there is demand and the economic case can be justified			1
" many towns ( in @entity99 ) have quite a hilly landscape and they are a good way of getting people out to the suburbs , " he said			0
" there are ( also ) other parts of the world like across shipping lanes where they can in fact be quite useful , but none of these things really applied to @entity175 , " @entity202 added .			0

an urban gondola 10.7 kilometers in length is being designed and built in the @entity239 city of @entity4
@entity103 , @entity102 and @entity104 have already *installed* similar structures as modes of mass city transportation
those behind the @entity4 project hope it will reduce traffic *congestion* and connect some of the city 's poorest areas
