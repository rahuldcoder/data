-- @entity1 has made much of president @entity2 playing what he considers an inordinate amount of golf			1
i 've even read blogs likening it to @entity9 fiddling while @entity10 burned			0
perhaps , and then again , perhaps not			0
clearly , there has been a long association with the ancient game and the @entity15 presidency			1
in fact , @entity2 is the 15th of the last 18 presidents to play golf			1
not only is he a hugely avid golfer , but a pretty fair one , too			0
as far as how much time he spends on the links , his annual rate of play is about the same as president @entity26 , with president @entity27 right on their heels			2
it 's clear , the presidency and our great game have quite a thing going			2
and it seems the golf bug is bipartisan			1
many people fondly recall @entity26 and his utter passion for the game			0
during his presidency , he played some 210 rounds at @entity41 , the home of the masters , many with his good friend @entity44			1
such was his fervor for the game , he even had a putting green installed on the @entity48 lawn			0
but @entity26 did n't play the most golf among our presidents , nor was he the best			1
the honor for the most golf played goes to @entity53			1
it 's said that he played at least a few holes each day -- even in the snow -- reportedly logging more than 1,000 rounds in his two terms			2
maybe that 's why the @entity61 failed			0
the best presidential golfer is widely acknowledged to be @entity63 , usually shooting around 80			1
but suffering from @entity65 's disease and a bad back , @entity63 did n't play much while he was in office			1
he spent more time in his @entity68 rocking chair than on the links			0
@entity27 , a passionate golfer whose foundation is associated with the recent @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , was best known for taking @entity75 , a somewhat extra-legal do - over shot in a friendly match			0
the press even coined a term for them -- " @entity81			0
" @entity82 often played at his family 's summer home in @entity85 before he was stricken with polio			2
a good golfer who never played while in office , he nevertheless made his mark on the game with his public works projects that led to the development of many public access golf courses , including one of the very best in the country , the @entity97 at @entity98 on @entity99 , @entity100 , the site of two recent @entity15 opens			1
@entity82 left quite a lasting legacy on the game			0
@entity104 played the game , warning his playing partners that it was n't proper to beat the president			1
most significantly , he used his outings on the links to secure votes for the @entity111			0
the best athlete as president ? easy : @entity114 , a former @entity115 at the @entity116			2
an avid golfer , right after @entity118 was sworn in replacing him , @entity114 immediately flew to @entity73 to play golf with @entity120 in his @entity121 just hours later			2
there 's more : president @entity123 , our 27th president , was so obsessive about the game he played in exhibition matches with top - notch players after his term of office ; president @entity131 , who never did get the hang of the game , left his clubs behind when he left the @entity48 ; president @entity135 , always seemingly politically motivated , was said to have taken up the game to cozy up to @entity26 and remain on the ticket as his running mate for a second term ; and president @entity140 , who was known to putt down the aisle of @entity142 into the section reserved for the national press			1
there is golf royalty associated with our presidents			1
@entity150 's grandfather , @entity149 , a former @entity151 president , donated the @entity152 , the trophy for the prestigious international biannual amateur team matches			2
and @entity150 's father , @entity155 , was also smitten with the game , serving as president of the golf association as well and officiating at a number of @entity161 ' matches			1
continuing the family tradition , @entity162 , our 43rd president , is also an avid player , currently sporting a 12 handicap			0
but in his presidency , as a sign of respect for the @entity15 troops serving in @entity169 and @entity170 , he said he decided to stop playing golf while they were in harm 's way			1
after all , a president has to know his priorities			0
while our game is compelling and can be all consuming , it is sometimes incorrectly perceived , more than other presidential leisure activities , as a rich man 's game			0
so maybe , just maybe , the current occupant of the @entity68 should curtail his golf while our troops are still in harm 's way and the national unemployment rate is more than 8.5 %			0
as with our other golfing presidents , there 's plenty of time for golf later			1
besides , he 'll never have to wait for a starting time			0
join the conversation on @entity198			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : @entity1 thinks president @entity2 plays golf too often
but @entity15 presidency and golf have a long , traditional association , @entity201 says
@entity201 says that @entity53 played the most ; @entity63 played the best
golf bug is clearly bipartisan , he says , and there is golf royalty among presidents
