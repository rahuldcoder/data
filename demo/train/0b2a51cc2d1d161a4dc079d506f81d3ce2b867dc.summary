@entity0 -- still reeling from the @entity3 accident in january that left at least 30 passengers dead , two of the largest cruise ship industry organizations have announced new safety policies aimed at helping both passengers and rescuers during an emergency at sea			1
under two new rules , a record of the nationality of all passengers aboard vessels will be kept on land and made readily available to search - and - rescue teams in an emergency , and passengers will be given a specific set of safety instructions during " musters , " or safety drills			1
passenger cruise ship regulations previously required companies to record the name and gender of each passenger , and to distinguish between adults , children and infants for search - and - rescue purposes			1
the new requirement to also record passenger nationality is intended to help ensure rescuers have key information immediately available to them in the event of an emergency			1
" certain governments have indicated that this would be very helpful in accounting for all passengers during rescue operations			1
in such situations , it is necessary to communicate with consulates and embassies to help locate , account for , and care for those involved in the incident , " @entity45 , @entity46 's director of public affairs , told @entity1			0
" it was conveyed to us by governments at the ( @entity57 ) that experience has demonstrated significant value in knowing which officials to contact for this purpose			0
" the new rule requiring documentation of passenger nationality is not related to security concerns over terrorism , @entity45 added			1
in the new muster policy , the 12 specific emergency instructions given to all passengers include : 1			1
when and how to don a life jacket			0
description of emergency signals and appropriate responses in the event of an emergency			0
where to muster when the emergency signal is sounded			0
the method of accounting for passenger attendance at musters both for training and in the event of an actual emergency			0
how information will be provided in an emergency			0
what to expect if the master orders an evacuation of the ship			0
what additional safety information is available			1
information on whether passengers should return to cabins prior to mustering , including specifics regarding medications , clothing , and life jackets			2
description of key safety systems and features			2
emergency routing systems and how to recognize emergency exits			0
who to seek out for additional information			0
" our industry continues to actively identify a range of measures that will improve the safety of passengers and crew , which is the top priority of the cruise industry , " @entity106 , president and ceo of @entity46 , said in a statement announcing the new safety policies			1
in february , @entity46 , which represents 26 @entity121 cruise ship companies , and the @entity122 , with 30 cruise ship companies , announced a policy change requiring all musters be performed prior to leaving port			1
after the @entity3 accident , officials learned about 600 of more than 3,000 the ship 's passengers had not participated in the muster drill because they got on the ship within hours of the accident			2
the massive passenger ship @entity3 struck rocks and rolled onto its side in shallow water off an island on @entity140 's @entity139 coast on january 13			0
there were roughly 4,200 people on the ship when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members , the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely			2
since the accident , the cruise line industry has been under pressure to improve safety measures in place during emergencies			1
industry representatives have met several times since the disaster to address concerns			0
more changes to safety procedures are expected in the coming months .			2
