-- many people have heard of the @entity3 movement -- the global organization founded in @entity5 to counter fast food and the " fast life			1
" its adherents favor gastronomic tradition and the calm , contemplative enjoyment of cuisine and life in general			0
now another idea is taking hold in the wake of @entity3 -- the quest for a quiet @entity5			1
it 's embodied in the establishment of a new @entity22 ( @entity5 site only ) , in @entity24 , which seeks to gather a list of the quietest hotels , towns and other places in @entity5			1
we 've collected 10 idyllic spots -- among the calmest , quietest and most powerfully relaxing in all @entity5 -- to suggest to the @entity22 as prime candidates for inclusion			1
@entity33 ( @entity34 , @entity35 ) no tv , no phone , no mini-bar , no air - con			0
go to bed when it 's dark , wake up at dawn			1
phones to be used outside only			1
this is also the first hotel in @entity5 with only single rooms -- so not the place for romance			1
it still feels like the monastery it once was -- the monk 's cells have been converted into rooms -- except now there 's a spa , and great @entity58 food instead of bread and water			1
there are even gregorian chants -- listening to them makes lying in the heated rock pool all the more relaxing			1
during the day , there 's little to do except explore the surrounding 3,000 hectares of national reserve			1
@entity33 , @entity67 , 2 ; +39 ( 0 ) 76 389 1010 ; rooms from $ 208 2			1
stargazing from the @entity69 ( @entity70 , @entity24 ) a single , stone medieval tower sits atop a wooded hill , overhanging a precipice			1
from this superb lookout , you 'd once have been able to spot enemies approaching from miles around across the @entity79 valley			0
now it 's open to the public -- a noble family fell on hard times and sold it to the state			1
surrounding it are just a few stone houses and cobbled streets			0
on clear nights , standing atop the tower , thick star clusters illuminate hills , vineyards and renaissance - era dwellings			0
if @entity24 has anywhere more quiet and calm , someone 's keeping silent about it			2
@entity99 ( @entity98 , 8 ; +39 ( 0 ) 55 228 0413 ; rooms from $ 40 ) is a b&b in the middle of the hamlet , right under the tower			2
the @entity104 ( @entity105 , 72 ; +39 ( 0 ) 577 887 263 ; dishes from $ 20 ) serves traditional meals such as bean soup and pici , typical handmade pasta			0
@entity112 ruins ( @entity113 , @entity114 ) it 's much easier to be transported to ancient times when you 're contemplating ruins in virtual solitude			1
@entity112 's ruins are superb and all the better without the crowds at the @entity122 elsewhere in @entity114			1
legend says @entity112 was built by @entity125 ' companion , the @entity126 warrior @entity124 , on returning home after burning @entity128			0
there 's a temple , theater and sanctuary			2
set in a remote part of @entity114 , surrounded by fields , the archaeological site is nonetheless well - kept			1
it 's way off the traditional tourist route and one of the least visited ancient sites in @entity5			1
@entity112 ( @entity5 site only ; @entity141 ; +39 348 883 0124 ; rooms from $ 54 ) is a typical @entity114 rural estate close to the site			1
the @entity145 ( @entity146 , @entity147 ) @entity149 , if it existed , quite possibly looked like this			0
there are cascades of multicolored plants , spouting fountains and rich bird life			0
running water is the only sound , and the odd tweet and whirr of wings			2
once a hellish , malaria - infested backwater , the @entity161 were turned into a 105 - hectare oasis in the early 20th century by the @entity164			0
the @entity165 ( " nymph " ) @entity166 cuts through the space , which includes rare ruins of an entire medieval town			0
@entity170 on the @entity171 , overlooking the @entity172 and the sea , is the closest city			0
@entity175 ( @entity176 44 , @entity170 ; +39 ( 0 ) 773 354 611 ; rooms from $ 38 ) has a well regarded restaurant with @entity146 specialties			2
@entity180 ( @entity181 , @entity114 ) separating you from the open sea -- the @entity184 -- is an archipelago of small islands dotted with ancient windmills			1
on the lagoon in a boat , you hold a glass of sweet @entity181 wine			0
in the background , there 's an orange - pink sunset			2
the only sounds come from things stirring in the hot breeze and low waves rocking the boat			0
the sunset aperitif served out here on the water by a tour company ( @entity5 site only ) comes with what 's almost a dinner : 12 types of @entity114 finger foods -- it 's tempting to stuff yourself at the first dish			1
the boat takes you out when the sun starts to set , anchors in the middle of the lagoon and brings you back when you 've had enough of the quiet			0
hotel picks in @entity181 include @entity218 ( @entity219 57 ; +39 092 371 9492 ; rooms from $ 108 ) , close to the harbor			1
restaurant @entity222 ( @entity224 28 ; +39 ( 0 ) 923 951 939 ; from $ 20 ) serves traditional @entity114 cuisine			1
@entity226 ( @entity227 ) stuck in the @entity184 halfway between @entity114 and @entity229 , this tiny volcanic atoll is off most travelers ' radar			1
people who do make it out here cluster on the noisier sister island of @entity236			0
but to silence seekers , @entity226 is bliss			2
ultimate silence can be found hiking up the extinct crater of @entity241			2
at the summit , a panorama of black rocks dotted with fluorescent green cacti and prickly pears stretches to the sea			0
this is the kingdom of a special kind of silence -- sea silence			1
a single road circles @entity226			2
there are a few , low - rise traditional dwellings and a bar that makes great slushies when it 's hot			2
on the beach of @entity260 , you might be lucky enough to find sea turtles from the island 's animal hospital being released into the sea			2
@entity267 ( @entity98 @entity266 , +39 ( 0 ) 92 272 212 ; rooms from $ 45 ) has modern , brightly colored rooms and serves fish bought direct from island fishermen			2
@entity272 ( @entity273 , @entity147 ) here you find " the silence of a dying city			1
" that 's how the citizens of @entity272 describe it			1
the town sits atop a high , narrow plateau of crumbling rock formed from compressed volcanic ash			0
each year , it slips a little further over the edge			0
the population has dwindled over the past century to little more than around 10 hardy hangers on			0
the original bridge to the town collapsed , replaced by a dizzying metal catwalk			0
once within the town , you can only get around on foot -- cars threaten further erosion			2
writers and yoga practitioners are drawn here for the calm that prevails -- strange , given that catastrophe seems just around the corner			2
@entity304 ( @entity305 ; +39 ( 0 ) 335 879 3077 ; rooms from $ 330 ) is a small villa inside the hamlet			2
@entity309 ( @entity305 , +39 ( 0 ) 76 179 2415 from $ 162 ) serves guests traditional recipes			0
@entity313 mushroom hunting ( @entity314 , @entity315 ) the deep mountain silence of the rugged @entity317 , @entity5 's smaller @entity318 , is what 's on offer here			1
solitary valleys are dotted with stone structures the @entity323 erected during their invasion in the 4th century @entity325 @entity327 porcini mushrooms , one of the great delicacies of @entity5 cuisine , are part of the allure			1
for a $ 20 ticket from park authorities ( @entity5 site only ; +39 ( 0 ) 536 72134 ) you can go on a porcini hunt and pick as many you can find			1
there 's a magical ambiance in the forest -- a local legend describes " the ghost of clouds			1
" if that 's not a silent image , what is ? @entity347 ( @entity348 ; +39 ( 0 ) 5367 4444 ; rooms from $ 60 ) , set at 1,400 meters , has the feel of a cozy mountain hut			1
the menu served to guests includes strong - flavored dishes such as wild boar			0
@entity356 ( @entity357 ) the farthest and wildest of the @entity357 , @entity356 offers a no - frills , zero sound pollution break amid turquoise waters , pebble beaches and prickly pears			0
" donkey taxis " are the main means of transportation across the island 's 10,000 steps and 25 kilometers of ancient pathways -- you 'll hear no roaring engines			1
and there are no banks -- you 'll need cash -- only one tiny supermarket and a newsstand			2
@entity378 ( @entity377 , +39 ( 0 ) 3409 207 605 ; stays from $ 1,800 ) is an @entity357 - style villa with a seafront terrace rented on a weekly base			0
spaghetti with caper cream is a top dish at @entity385 , part of @entity387 ( @entity388 ; +39 0909 889 902 )			0
@entity390 ( near @entity391 ) you need n't go too far from possibly the noisiest place in @entity5 , @entity391 , to find silence			1
a sacred hill to the ancient @entity396 , the " sleeping giant " of @entity389			0
@entity390 spikes up from the @entity398 an hour from the capital			0
hiking routes wind through a dense forest gouged with rock chasms			0
you might find wild boar footprints beneath you and hear hawks ' cries above			0
the so - called @entity406 leads to the highest peak , where there 's an ancient stone shrine			2
here 's where @entity411 @entity410 is said to have miraculously cured @entity413 of leprosy			0
for a moment , given the purity of the air and the heavenly view , you can believe it			0
the @entity420 rural estate ( @entity421 , @entity422 ; +39 076 1578 728 ; rooms from $ 54 ) overlooks the promontory			0
@entity425 ( @entity5 site only ; @entity427 8 ; +39 ( 0 ) 76 157 9950 ) , in the hillside town of @entity422 , serves recommended local cuisine			1
@entity430 is a @entity391 - based travel writer who has contributed to @entity431 , the @entity432 and @entity433 .			0

@entity22 *announces* plan to *map* @entity5 's quietest places
one possible candidate is a hotel with no @entity440 or phones -- and single rooms only
@entity114 's @entity180 promises quality silence on the water
almost *abandoned* @entity272 is falling off a cliff -- but it 's *peaceful*
