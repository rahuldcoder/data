@entity0 -- the best time to be taking over as chief executive of a bank is when all the bad news is out in public			1
the announcement of @entity8 ' appointment as the new chief executive of @entity11 's @entity10 came just hours after the news that the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) had launched a second criminal investigation into the bank 's activities			1
this latest one concerns fees paid to @entity20 ( @entity20 ) during the bank 's 2008 capital raising exercise			0
last month the @entity13 said it was probing the manipulation of @entity25 and other benchmark lending rates , the scandal that earlier this year cost @entity10 both its former chief executive @entity28 and chairman @entity29			1
on that basis , the ideal time for @entity8 to take over would have been in six months to a year from now when the investigations are completed -- and always assuming that nothing else comes out of the woodwork at crisis - prone @entity10 along the way			1
the worst time would have been three months ago before the libor scandal broke			2
either way analysts and market watchers have been broadly positive about @entity8 ' appointment , which was widely predicted in the financial press			1
are some banks too big to prosecute ? what @entity10 needs more than anything is a period of stable management to allow it to make some critical changes			2
these include repairing the damage to the bank 's reputation from the various scandals which have engulfed it			0
@entity10 also needs to change the " anything goes " trading culture at the investment bank , and come up with an overall strategy that can provide growth against the backdrop of a poor economic environment and a raft of new regulations			2
it 's not exactly an easy gig			0
but in many ways , the selection of @entity8 is quite a clever choice			1
he is from the consumer side of the business and has a track record of producing results			1
a report from @entity74 comments that the two divisions he has run -- @entity77 and retail and business banking -- are the only two currently meeting the bank 's 13 % return on equity targets			0
@entity8 has sat on the bank 's group executive committee since 2009 but has managed to stay out of the negative headlines relating to the banking crisis			1
he started his career at @entity10 back in 1983 as a graduate trainee but also worked for a considerable time at @entity90 , giving him breadth of experience			2
@entity93 : culture of money must change most important of all he is not @entity28			0
the brash style of the @entity99 investment banker -- who became the chief executive in 2011 , after having spent more than a decade building up the markets business -- was known to have irritated @entity11 regulators and played badly in a political environment where excessive risk taking by banks is blamed for causing the current crisis			1
to those who suggest that @entity8 does n't know the investment banking business sufficiently to manage it effectively , the riposte must be that not being part of the deal making culture is one of his strengths			0
@entity10 badly needs someone who has enough perspective on investment banking to ask tough questions about which parts of the business make sufficient returns to justify the risks being taken , and that genuinely provide customers with a service			0
those activities that do n't measure up should be junked			0
age of irresponsibility ? besides , if @entity8 feels he lacks any knowledge of investment banking , he can simply walk down the corridor and speak to the new chairman of @entity10 sir @entity134 who is a veteran of @entity135 as well as the @entity136 and the @entity11 treasury			1
it may be too early to talk of the @entity134 / @entity8 combo as the dream team but frankly it 's the best that could be hoped for given the disarray at @entity10 and the likelihood of their names being dragged into the mainstream press on almost any trumped up charge			1
with the new team in place the critical question is what will they deliver ? the speculation that they might split investment and retail banking is probably ill - informed			0
new @entity11 regulations , arising out of the commission led by sir @entity156 , already stipulate that retail must be ring fenced so that depositors ' funds are protected from any losses arising in the investment bank			0
furthermore , if the bank is to make a decent living from providing genuine services to corporate customers -- as opposed to trading on its own account -- then the universal banking model of offering a broad range of services under one roof is the only sensible route to take			0
one key part of @entity8 ' strategy is bound to be expanding those same services in the emerging markets , especially in fast expanding @entity179 where @entity10 has a strong presence			2
one of its strengths is its ownership of @entity185 , the third largest bank in @entity179			0
finally , @entity8 has to make sure that @entity11 retail , the part of the bank he knows best , continues to improve , take market share and most importantly of all assist in the recovery of the bank 's reputation			2
he would be helped in this task by a speedy result on the two @entity13 investigations -- into libor manipulation and fees paid to the @entity20 -- and a minimum of fallout			0
but that 's probably too much to ask for and @entity8 may have to accept that he spends the first six months to a year in his new job fighting fires .			1

@entity204 : ideal time for new @entity10 ' chief executive to take over would be six months to a year from now
but analysts and market watchers have been broadly positive about @entity8 ' appointment
the selection of @entity8 is quite a clever choice -- he is from the consumer side of the bank and produces results
