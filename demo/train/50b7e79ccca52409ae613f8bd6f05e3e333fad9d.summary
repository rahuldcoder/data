-- critics are already gushing over @entity3 's new " @entity2 " as a potential @entity5 contender			1
much of the praise centers on how the film makes the larger - than - life president at once heroic and human			1
by all accounts , it deftly explores both his personal and political wisdom through scenes like the one in which @entity16 , who plays @entity17 , cites ancient mathematical theory in an assessment of humanity : " it 's a self - evident truth that things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other			0
" but even as moviegoers line up for tickets , some in @entity26 may well wonder what one special fan of @entity30 might take away from a screening			1
president @entity33 is a self - professed , lifelong admirer of the 16th president , who is by many accounts the most popular and influential of all chief executives in @entity39 history			1
holding @entity41 ' blue wall ' was crucial for @entity33 victory shortly before taking office in 2009 , the @entity33 family made an unannounced late night visit to the @entity46 and since , the 44th president has stopped by again			1
mr. @entity33 took his oath on the same @entity2 used for his inauguration in 1861 ; a small volume sheathed in stained red velvet with gilt edges			1
he has frequently been spotted reading about @entity30 and he 's fond of quoting the rail - splitter in his speeches , most notably during the recent @entity56			1
" i 'm far more mindful of my own failings , " he told the convention crowd , " knowing exactly what @entity30 meant when he said , ' i have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that i had no place else to go			1
' " some @entity64 have since suggested he actually misquoted @entity30 in that instance , but the point remains : @entity33 is a big @entity2 fan			1
so what advice might @entity30 have for @entity33 as he heads toward a second term ? in the land of @entity30 , at @entity71 , professor @entity69 is one of the nation 's leading @entity2 scholars			1
he suggests that @entity74 might be : make your enemies into friends			0
@entity69 notes that @entity30 had an enormous talent for turning around even his fiercest opponents			2
" he was able to keep his eye on the prize , " @entity69 says , " which means he was able to disassociate himself from personal attacks			0
" no matter how cruelly his foes savaged him , @entity30 repeatedly rose above the fray , using humor and warmth to disarm his enemies and refocus everyone on the agenda at hand			2
instances of his temper showing , @entity69 notes , were rare			0
opinion : election a call for purple politics @entity99 : be firm , but play nice			0
despite his legendarily laconic style , @entity69 says @entity30 had a single - minded ability to steadily exert political pressure on others , inexorably pushing them toward the action he wanted , or rather he felt the nation needed			2
and yet , he did so in a way that left others feeling unthreatened			0
" he could talk without anger , " @entity69 says			0
" he could talk without heat to his political opponents			0
" @entity113 : take the long view			0
@entity30 clearly saw the future in a way that many of his contemporaries could not			2
he imagined not merely the end of slavery , but also the repercussions that would follow for freed @entity121 , southern citizens , and northerners as well			0
he knew resolution might take many years , and yet he tried to point the politics of the day in the proper direction			0
" he believed firmly , i think , that if we put our heads to it and we put our wills to it , the @entity39 people could be that shining example of equality for the world , " @entity69 says			0
@entity69 is the first to say that there is so much more about @entity30 , noting the volumes of work about him			2
at @entity141 , where @entity30 was assassinated , workers constructed a 34 - foot tall tower of books to represent all the titles published about @entity30 ; more than 15,000 in all , according to their count			2
it is unlikely that @entity33 has read them all and it is not known when or if he 'll see the new @entity2 movie , but undoubtedly , @entity17 still has plenty of lessons for our times ... honestly .			1
