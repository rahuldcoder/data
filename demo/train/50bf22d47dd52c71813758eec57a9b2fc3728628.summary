@entity0 , @entity1 -- the bodies of the nine suspected @entity5 terrorists -- all believed to have been involved in the attacks on @entity7 -- are still lying in a hospital morgue almost five months after the attacks occurred			1
security is tight for the trial of the only surviving alleged @entity7 terrorist			1
the public prosecutor trying the lone surviving suspected gunman in the @entity7 attacks told @entity2 the dead suspects have not been buried because no one has come to claim them and local @entity20 officials are refusing to bury the men in @entity7 's @entity20 graveyards			1
public prosecutor @entity23 said he will soon be in discussions with officials to decide what should happen with the bodies			2
the burial issue has stoked controversy			2
groups such as the @entity30 do n't want the people buried in @entity20 cemeteries because they have defamed the religion			1
other muslims have disagreed , saying burial should be available for any @entity20			1
@entity35 -- professor of @entity37 history and associate director of the @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity41 -- said the @entity43 religious traditions , including @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity37 , have very often set restrictions on grounds they have sanctified for burials			2
one stricture , for example , has been prohibiting burial of a person from another faith			0
" the non-burial " of the suspected terrorists " is making the statement that they are acting so contrary to @entity37 they are not acting as @entity20 and therefore they are judged as being unbelievers and not worthy of being buried in a @entity20 cemetery , " @entity35 said			1
@entity1 , which has a population of over 1.1 billion people , is 81 percent @entity64 , 13 percent @entity20 , and 2 percent @entity65 , according to data from the @entity67			1
one surprising aspect about the burial issue , @entity35 said , is that the @entity1 @entity20 community is usually not very proactive publicly and tries to avoid publicity			1
" in this particular case , it 's very important for the @entity1 @entity20 community to make it clear that they have nothing to do with the people who claim to be @entity20 who engaged in terrorism in @entity7 , " @entity35 said			1
@entity23 is prosecuting a case against @entity79 the 10th suspected @entity5 terrorist			0
police say the 10 men gunned down more than 160 people in the november attack on @entity7 , @entity1 's financial capital			1
the attack went on for four nights and three days including the siege of three luxury hotels and a @entity90 center			0
police say @entity79 is the only suspected gunman caught alive			0
the alleged actions of the nine suspects who were killed in the attacks will likely play a role as the prosecution builds its case against @entity79			0
after months of delays due to security concerns and difficulty finding an attorney to defend @entity79 , his trial finally got under way friday			0
@entity79 is being charged with 12 criminal counts including murder , attempted murder and waging war against @entity1			1
police say he was caught on a surveillance camera holding a gun as he stalked and killed people inside @entity7 's main train station , formerly known as @entity115			2
@entity79 is also accused of shooting people at @entity7 's @entity117			2
@entity79 's newly court - appointed defense attorney , @entity118 , argued that @entity79 was under age and should be tried in @entity120 , but judge @entity121 disagreed saying @entity79 was more than 20 years old and could not be considered a juvenile			0
in his opening statements @entity23 read from @entity79 's alleged confession on how he trained for the attacks			0
the terror attack was in order to capture @entity128 , @entity23 said			0
the @entity128 territory has long been a source of tension between @entity1 and @entity5			2
@entity118 said @entity79 is now retracting his statements because @entity79 says he confessed under police pressure			0
the court hearing is continuing			0
from @entity2 's @entity0 bureau and @entity136 in @entity137			0
