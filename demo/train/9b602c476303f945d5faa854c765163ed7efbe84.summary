a real protest , a fake @entity2 employee , a viral video and some shiny buses have brought attention to the growing tensions between @entity8 's moneyed tech - sector workers and the city 's working poor and middle class			1
private bus lines snake through @entity8 , transporting employees in climate - controlled , @entity14 - enabled , cushioned comfort to their jobs at large @entity18 companies			1
offered as a free employee perk by @entity2 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and other companies , the large buses have become a symbol of income inequality here and a lightning rod for resentment			1
on monday , organizers staged a protest at a @entity2 bus stop in @entity8 with signs that read " warning : two - tier system " and " public $ $ $ $ , private gains			1
" a video taken at the scene showed a confrontation between what seemed to be a protester and a @entity2 employee who yelled , " why do n't you go to a city that can afford it ? this is a city for the right people who can afford it			0
" only , in a very @entity8 twist , the @entity2 employee was a fake , played by union organizer and sometime occupy protester @entity51 , who described the stunt later as " political theater to demonstrate what is happening to the city			2
" some skeptics on @entity58 immediately detected that something was off about the confrontation , saying the so - called @entity2 employee 's rants were too perfectly aligned with the stereotype of the spoiled , overpaid techie			0
but the clumsy stunt spread online has called national attention to the issue			0
critics claim that the buses block bike lanes and traffic , and frequently squat in existing public bus stops			1
they also say the money that companies sink into the lines could be spent on improving existing public transportation for everyone			1
it 's similar to the private - vs. - public school argument in many cities			1
people who can afford to segregate themselves do so at the expense of the public institutions that depend on the support of people from all income levels			2
residents who do n't work for cash - rich tech companies are left to take @entity8 's less - reliable 101 - year - old public transit system , @entity90 , with its mix of older buses , trains and trollies that link up with the @entity96 and @entity97 train networks			1
as rents rise , people who ca n't afford to stay in the city are pushed farther out , and their dependance on reliable public transportation to get to their jobs increases			1
that 's no small percentage of the city 's population			0
in @entity8 , 23.4 % of residents are below the poverty threshold , according to the @entity109 and the @entity110			2
in fairness , the buses are not evil on wheels : they 're meant to keep cars off the road to minimize congestion and pollution			0
" the private shuttle buses are a visible symbol of economic inequality , so they are a convenient place for people to vent their frustration			1
but they are not the problem , " said @entity125 , executive director at @entity127 urban policy organization spur			2
" the problem is that our public transit system is n't good enough and that , for historical reasons , many of the tech companies are located in suburban campuses that do n't have transit			1
" @entity2 actually has showed a great interest in solving transportation problems and is working on a driverless car that also aims to reduce traffic			2
but , like with private buses , the technology will mostly benefit those who can afford it			1
transportation is just one of a number of issues related to the tech industry that have inflamed tensions in the city			2
soaring housing prices and gentrification , also blamed on the influx of high - paying tech jobs , have longtime residents worried that the city will be overtaken by the newly wealthy , pushing out middle - and working - class residents			1
they worry that without its communities of artists , activists and immigrants , @entity8 's unique character and history will be paved over for new condos with perks like dog - washing areas and music rehearsal rooms			1
" a city without its nurses , its teachers , its artists , its waiters , its bus drivers , its cops , its musicians and writers and grandmothers as residents is a monoculture -- as sterile as a forest of a single commercial tree species , " @entity169 wrote in a recent @entity171 opinion piece			0
@entity8 's potential for growth is stunted by bodies of water on three sides			2
according to the @entity192 , 825,863 people live in @entity8 , compared with 8.3 million in all of @entity193 , which has about twice the landmass			2
low vacancy rates and surging demand have increased the median rental rate in @entity8 to $ 3,414			2
home prices in the area have risen 22 % in the past three years			0
the recent demand for housing is heavily fueled by the influx of high - paid technology employees			1
software engineers make an average of $ 127,143 a year at @entity2 , $ 121,507 at @entity21 and $ 124,630 at @entity22 , according to @entity206			0
these young workers need someplace to live , and many choose to reside in vibrant @entity8 and commute to their sleepy company headquarters farther south on the peninsula			1
matters are made worse when people associated with the industry voice controversial opinions about the class divides			0
a couple of days after the bus protest , the masses got the blabbermouth , tone - deaf techie they craved when @entity18 entrepreneur @entity223 posted his thoughts on the city 's homeless population to @entity21			1
" there is nothing more grotesque than walking down market st in @entity8			0
why the heart of our city has to be overrun by crazy , homeless , drug dealers , dropouts , and trash i have no clue , " he wrote in the rant			0
@entity223 went on to compare the homeless to hyenas and call them a disgrace			0
" there is an area of town for degenerates and an area of town for the working class			0
there is nothing positive gained from having them so close to us , " he said			0
he has since taken to his @entity21 page to apologize			0
these types of outbursts happen every so often on social media and blogging platforms like @entity261			0
in august , entrepreneur @entity262 included the homeless in his list of 10 things he hates about @entity8 , along with unattractive women and bad public transit			1
obviously , these individual entrepreneurs do not speak for the @entity127 's entire population of tech workers			1
but their outbursts are the sort of attitude @entity18 would prefer not to be associated with			0
the buses may be the most visible and convenient targets for anti-gentrification activists , but the underlying problem wo n't be fixed if buses stop blocking traffic			0
some potential solutions include getting tech companies to relocate nearer to public transit and getting the city to invest in improving the current transportation system , according to @entity285			1
other improvements he suggests include raising the minimum wage , adding housing for all income levels and improving education so the people growing up in the city can compete for those big - money jobs nearby			0
@entity285 is optimistic that the fast - growing economy can benefit all of @entity8			2
" we just need to take the next steps and make sure we do everything possible to connect everyone with this growing economy and to make a new round of investments in infrastructure , which will lay the foundations for the future , " he said .			0

a staged protest of private buses brings attention to income inequality
many @entity127 tech companies offer private bus rides to employees as a perk
critics says the buses block traffic and *deprive* public transportation of income
well - paid tech workers have also contributed to the soaring cost of living in @entity8
