@entity0 -- the @entity5 needs a new law requiring that the president consult with @entity8 before going to war , a blue - ribbon panel led by two former secretaries of state said tuesday			1
@entity10 , left , and @entity11 led a panel that recommended a new @entity13			1
the current @entity13 is " ineffective , and it should be repealed and it should be replaced , " @entity10 said in a joint appearance with @entity11 , announcing the results of the study they led			1
the recommendation follows failed efforts by @entity20 in @entity8 to put a stop to the war in @entity23 or to put conditions on president @entity26 's conduct of it			1
@entity8 passed a joint resolution to authorize armed force against @entity23 in 2002 , but some @entity26 opponents say it should not have been interpreted as a blank check for the @entity5 to invade and occupy the @entity33 nation			0
@entity10 , who served in @entity26 's administration , and @entity11 , who served under president @entity35 , said their project was not prompted by any specific war , with @entity11 adding that the commission had " tried very hard not to call balls and strikes on past history here			1
" " we did n't direct this report at any particular conflict , " @entity10 added			0
the existing law , the @entity13 of 1973 , has been regarded as unconstitutional by every president since it was passed as a response to the @entity48 , @entity10 and @entity11 said			1
it requires presidents to report regularly to @entity8 about ongoing conflicts , but the provision has been flouted			0
" no president has ever made a submission to @entity8 pursuant to the @entity13 since 1973 , " former sen. @entity53 , a @entity54 member of the committee , said tuesday			1
the panel , formally called the @entity59 , said a new law should be created requiring the president to consult with key members of @entity8 before sending troops into combat expected to last more than a week , or within three days of doing so in the case of operations that need to be kept secret			1
it should also make clear exactly who the president needed to consult			0
the panel suggests that the president talk to " a joint congressional committee made up of the leaders of the @entity73 and the @entity74 as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees			0
" the new committee would have a permanent professional staff with access to intelligence information , @entity10 and @entity11 said			2
@entity8 , in turn , would have to declare war or vote on a " resolution of approval " within 30 days , they said			2
if a resolution of approval failed , any member of @entity8 could introduce a " resolution of disapproval , " but it was not clear that such an act would stop a war in progress			0
@entity11 was unable to say in the news conference what practical effect congressional disapproval would have			0
@entity10 said the commission had been in touch with the presidential campaigns of @entity104 @entity103 and @entity54 @entity105 , as well as leaders of @entity8			2
he declined to reveal what they thought of the proposal , but said : " we have n't gotten a negative reaction			0
" @entity8 has not officially declared war since 1942 , when the @entity5 entered formal hostilities with the @entity114 in @entity115 but since then , presidents have sent troops into countries including @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity23			0
the @entity122 makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces , but gives @entity8 the power to declare war and approve military budgets			2
@entity10 and @entity11 's group included both @entity54 and @entity20 and held seven meetings over 14 months .			2
