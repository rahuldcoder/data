-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 wants a mandate			1
apparently , the one he and his @entity4 , or @entity4 , claimed less than two years ago was n't enough			0
so , as his policy agenda faltered and his approval ratings plummeted , the prime minister called snap elections last month ( less than half way through the @entity11 's term ) to try to claim a vote of confidence from the public and crush dissenters who oppose his agenda			1
@entity1 will almost certainly get his election victory ; a mandate is another matter , however			1
the most notable outcomes of the december 14 ballot are likely to be apathy and cynicism , even if his party holds its majority in @entity26 or -- as polls last week predicted -- increases it			2
@entity1 and the @entity4 returned to power in december 2012 determined to reassert @entity2 's role in a rapidly changing @entity30			1
@entity1 put economic rejuvenation at the top of his policy agenda , seeking to end two - plus " lost decades " to both consolidate political support and , perhaps even more significantly , to provide the foundation for a more robust international role			2
" @entity38 " was an instant success			0
the yen plunged in value , spurring exports ( and corporate profits ) , and producing growth that , while mild , well outpaced that of the year before			0
with that accomplishment in his pocket , the new prime minister turned to his real interest : an activist foreign policy that would remind the world that @entity2 is a " first tier nation			1
" @entity1 traveled the globe , offering political and financial support to diplomatic partners and reasserting @entity2 national interests			1
a core , if not the most important , component of his agenda was lifting domestic obstacles to a more intense regional security role , long inhibited by constitutional constraints			2
for the vast majority of @entity2 voters , support for the @entity4 stemmed from the prospect of economic revival , and they were prepared to swallow parts of @entity1 's security agenda if that was part of the package			1
unfortunately for @entity1 , the economy has slowed in recent months with @entity2 now technically in recession after two consecutive quarters of negative growth			1
companies are doing well , but wages remain stagnant , and with inflation picking up -- an integral part of @entity38 is getting consumers to spend before prices rise -- pay packets are shrinking			0
the economic woes mean @entity1 ca n't buy support for the rest of his agenda ; in fact , public complaints about the @entity1 administration are increasing			2
the public is hostile to his goal of restarting @entity2 's nuclear energy program , shut down since the triple catastrophe of march 11 , 2011 , is suspicious of the @entity90 his government passed , and does not share his eagerness to revise @entity2 's constitution to allow it to more readily use its military , even if in the service of the @entity99 - @entity2 alliance , as the prime minister and his team insist they intend			1
and for all the talk of @entity2 's turn to the right -- @entity1 is a conservative nationalist -- the prime minister is not representative of his country or his party			1
the @entity2 public is reluctant to unshackle its military and is wary of the high - profile security role @entity1 seeks			1
the @entity4 contains a spectrum of political positions , and if the party has a center , it is left of the current government 's views			0
yet opinion polls show the @entity4 increasing its share of seats in the parliament , despite dropping approval ratings for the @entity122 and @entity1			2
why ? the anomaly is best explained by the state and structure of @entity2 politics			0
the @entity4 returned to power after three years of a @entity129 administration , a party voted into office in 2009 by a public that had lost hope in the @entity4 after it had governed @entity2 for nearly half a century			2
those hopes were dashed : the @entity129 proved incapable and incompetent , although the @entity4 helped with intractable opposition to every @entity129 policy			0
not surprisingly , support for the @entity129 , still the largest opposition party , today hovers around 10 % ; 37 % of voters say they will back the @entity4 in this month 's vote			0
most of the rest remain undecided			0
as a result , turnout may prove to be the lowest since @entity144 the structure of the voting system magnifies the impact of this disaffection			0
there are significant population differences among districts ( sufficient in fact for the @entity2 @entity153 to rule them unconstitutional ; the court has n't overturned an election result , however )			2
parties that are strong in sparsely populated districts get disproportionate seats from an election win			0
the @entity4 is such a party			0
this is how @entity1 and company , despite increasing unpopularity , increase seats in an election			2
the prime minister knows the math and that is why he called an election			1
snap elections are usually the result of a loss of support within the legislature : a government loses its majority			0
that is n't even an option in @entity2			0
in this case , the @entity1 government is threatened by the failure of its own policies , not a real opposition			0
while @entity1 claims to have called the vote to win a mandate for election reform , in reality , he aims to exploit a disorganized opposition and lock in his party 's electoral majority for an extended period			1
the public knows that , too , and that is why cynicism is on the rise among voters			0
they also fear that @entity1 will instead focus on foreign policy and press the more controversial elements of his national security agenda			1
if he does , the prime minister will simply end up undermining whatever mandate he will claim after this week 's ballot .			1
