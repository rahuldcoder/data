-- if a @entity3 picture is worth a thousand words , we 're pretty sure there 's one word in the lexicon you 'd be loath to have associated with you : tool			1
( unless you 're a handyman , in which case , carry on			2
) yes , @entity3 started off as a gated community for college kids awkwardly trolling for chicks in their rooms because the outside world was just too bright ... too bright			2
but now , as @entity16 sallies forth with his plan to consume all of society , it has become kind of legit			0
last week , @entity16 unveiled a messaging system for the book of faces that will consolidate e-mail , texts , chat and @entity3 messages			0
while we ( unlike myriad reactionary news outlets ) wo n't be calling @entity30 's new baby a " @entity33 killer " any time soon ( dude , eradicate all those @entity3 phishing scams and then we 'll talk ) , the fact that @entity3 would take such a step got us thinking			1
every day , 4 billion messages are shot off via @entity3 , and next to those 4 billion messages is something that could make or break the legitimacy of your missive -- or , at the very least , amuse or horrify your friends : your profile picture			1
this is your calling card , your public face			0
so why do so many of you contort it into that of a duck ? read on for five common types of @entity3 photos that make your friends want to block you , potential employers take pause and future suitors weep with frustration at the state of the human race			1
the " @entity58 shot " oh , the " @entity58 shot " -- in which men pose shirtless in front of their bathroom mirrors and women pout into their boobs			1
you think it makes you look sexy , but , truth be told , it makes you look like you have no friends			1
which makes sense , considering the dudes are always hanging out shirtless in the bathroom and the chicks always look so freaking depressed			1
fun fact : research from ok cupid shows the " @entity58 shot " is the most effective snap for women when it comes to racking up messages			1
still , that same research shows that shots of a chick doing something interesting , as opposed to looking sexy , garnered more meaningful communication			0
yes , @entity3 is not ok @entity87 , but the research holds true : a cell phone pic may get you some attention , but , well , so will drunkenly passing out at a party and flashing your underwear			0
and for those among you who are too deeply entrenched in the morass of narcissism to pry @entity96 from hand , might we suggest getting an account on @entity100 ? this service lets you take a photo of yourself every day in order to track how your appearance changes over time			0
at least then you can call it art ... or something			0
subbing in an inanimate object / pet / baby " hey @entity110			0
. so , i 've known you for about five years now and i 'm pretty sure you are not a crude drawing of a dinosaur , a cat with lasers for eyes or a green square			0
no , i 'm pretty sure you 're a skinny dude with an only slightly unfortunate haircut			0
" so thinketh your friends when nary a picture on your @entity3 profile is actually of you			2
also , people will start to wonder if you have been disfigured in some horrifying accident and -- @entity124 - like -- are masking your hideous face with that of @entity127 's			1
if you insist on getting creative with your profile pic , check out @entity129 , which lets you create profile images that promote a cause			0
liquoring up a couple of party pictures in which you 're holding a glass of wine or a beer are fine , but a parade of profile pics that could pass for @entity140 ads -- or , for that matter , the photo above -- are probably not the best choice when it comes to looking like a professional / not an alcoholic			2
yeah , that pic of you in the pool doing @entity148 might be hilarious to your poker pals and fellow former frat bros , but the kids you teach fourth grade math to ( and their parents ) will probably be less than amused			0
group shots let 's say you meet a new dude at a dark party			2
the guy seems nice , and looks to be cute from what you can tell through the haze of the smoke machine and @entity162 ( it has n't been banned everywhere yet , folks ) , but you ca n't quite tell because of the crudely markered - on @entity166 beard ( oh , forgot to mention it 's @entity168 )			1
the next day , you eagerly seek out homeboy on @entity3 , only to find a profile picture that features not one , but five similar - looking dudes lying in the grass -- wearing @entity174 and fedoras			1
how are you supposed to tell which is which , and whether you should click " friend " ? yeah , @entity3 is not technically a dating site , but let 's face it , the first thing you do after meeting a new romantic interest is stalk the hell outta him or her			1
according to a survey from @entity186 , within one week of meeting someone , 79 percent of 16 - 21 year - olds add that person to their @entity3 circle			2
and , as shallow as it is , folks will judge you based on your profile -- that same research shows that 43 percent of girls would decide not to date someone if his profile was a bust			2
so do n't hide behind your friends in the shot that 's supposed to show who you are			1
save that for after the breakup , when you run into her at your local watering hole			0
holiday or wedding pics ... months after the wedding yes , it was totally awesome that that @entity210 you went to featured not one , not two , but three @entity212 ( you are the dude mentioned above , btw ) , but it 's not so awesome that you should still keep a picture documenting this phenom front and center in late november			1
a week or two tops , friends , and then it 's back to that lovely shot of you wearing pleated pants and a polo ( we 'll tackle that problem at a later date )			1
the same goes for wedding photos			2
it 's really nice that you got married , and we all pored through every shot from the ceremony , but leaving up a portrait of you in full bridal garb for several months is akin to shoving your ring in your friends ' faces daily			1
we are no longer happy for you			0
you are now just gloating			0
we fear the day when you produce offspring .			0

the self - taken " @entity58 shot " makes you look like you have no friends
do n't hide behind your friends in the shot that 's supposed to show who you are
@entity210 photos are awesome -- but not so awesome in late - november
