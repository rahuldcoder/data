@entity0 -- @entity3 accident investigators are probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard @entity7 -- the same type of plane that crashed into the @entity10 nearly a month ago			1
investigators are looking into incidents aboard two other @entity7			1
the planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage , the @entity13 said thursday			1
one flight was between the @entity3 and @entity19 in may and the other between @entity21 and @entity22 in june			2
the probes were launched in the aftermath of the june 1 crash in the @entity10 -- when @entity26 was flying to @entity27 , @entity28 , from @entity29 , @entity19			1
all 228 people on board the plane , an @entity30 , were killed			1
investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors known as pitot tubes , among other factors , as a possible cause of the @entity26 crash			1
that flight sent 24 automated error messages in the four minutes before it crashed , the head of the @entity28 accident investigation board , @entity45 , has said			2
the error messages all indicate there were problems with on - board information about the plane 's speed , which can cause some of the plane 's instruments to stop functioning , @entity45 said			0
search teams are looking for the bulk of the plane 's wreckage and for its flight data recorders			0
the first of the two incidents being investigated by the @entity13 happened may 21 , when a @entity62 flight from @entity63 , @entity64 , to @entity65 , @entity19 , experienced a loss of primary speed and altitude information while in flight , the @entity13 said			2
" initial reports indicate that the flight crew noted an abrupt drop in indicated outside air temperature , followed by the loss of the @entity75 and disconnections of the autopilot and autothrust , along with the loss of speed and altitude information , " the @entity13 said			0
the flight crew used backup instruments and the primary data was restored in about five minutes , the @entity13 said			0
another " possibly similar " incident happened june 23 on a @entity86 flight between @entity21 and @entity87 , @entity22 , the @entity13 said			0
investigators from the @entity13 are gathering data recorder information , monitoring system messages , crew statements and weather information , the @entity13 said .			0

@entity94 *involves* two failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard @entity7
on june 1 , an @entity99 @entity30 crashed into the @entity10
investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors in that crash
