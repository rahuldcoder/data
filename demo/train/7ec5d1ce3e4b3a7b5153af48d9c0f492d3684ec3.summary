@entity0 , @entity1 -- the skull of a female @entity4 -- the first - ever discovery -- suggests the upright ancestors of humans may have been physiologically closer to modern gorillas and chimpanzees			1
@entity10 holds the @entity4 complete skull he discovered in 2000 near @entity12 in @entity1			1
homo erectus , long viewed as a crucial evolutionary link between modern humans and their tree - dwelling ancestors , may have been more ape - like than previously thought , scientists said thursday			1
unveiling newfound fossils , a team of @entity1 scientists said they were surprised to find that early female hominids were much smaller than males			1
gorillas and chimpanzees also exhibit big differences in size between males and females			0
the fossils , an ancient skull and a jawbone from two early branches of the human family tree -- @entity4 and @entity34 , were revealed at @entity1 's @entity35			1
both fossils were found in 2000 east of @entity12			2
but the homo erectus skull , dating back 1.55 million years , was slightly older than the homo habilis jawbone , which was found to be 1.44 million years old , the scientists said			1
" prior to the discovery of the new specimens , scientists did not know that homo erectus males were far larger than the females , " said dr @entity40 , one of the team			2
" this sexual dimorphism [ two forms of the same species ] is considered a primitive character because it occurs in other apes , " she said , standing in front of the bones at the museum			0
she said this could also mean the sexual behavior of homo erectus was more like that of apes , where individuals , especially males , mate with several partners , sometimes in a few hours , than that of its more monogamous human successors			2
the fossils , discovered in east @entity67 's @entity66 , regarded as the " cradle of humankind " , challenge the idea that human prototypes evolved one after the other in a linear fashion from @entity34 to @entity4 , ending with modern humans			1
this means they must have co-existed in different habitats at the same time , the scientists added			0
" they were kind of sisters , if you like , " said @entity77 , the scientist who discovered the fossils			2
" homo habilis never gave rise to @entity4			1
these discoveries have completely changed the story			0
" the research , first published in the journal nature , was conducted by nine scientists including well - known paleontologist @entity89 and her daughter @entity90			2
the scientists think both @entity4 and @entity34 must have evolved from a common ancestor 2 - 3 million years ago			1
the most famous such ancestor is @entity95 's " @entity94 , " a fossil more than 3 million years old that set off this week for a tour of museums in the @entity99			0
the basic evolutionary story -- that all humans came " @entity104 " after evolving from apes in the @entity66 around 5 million years ago -- remains unchanged and may even be strengthened , the scientists said			2
" the more fossils we find in @entity1 , the more we justify the story that east @entity67 is the cradle of mankind , " @entity10 said			1
" these hominids tell us there was a large diversity within this species , which strengthens that convention			0
" the researchers said homo habilis was largely a herbivore , likely to have foraged for fruits in greener , more heavily forested areas than @entity4 , who is thought to have been a hunter who thrived in east @entity67 's open savannah			1
@entity10 said the team would have to find more fossils to confirm the findings			0
" the story of human evolution has not yet been [ told ] , " said @entity127 director @entity126			0
" there are many missing links			0
the more discoveries you make , the more questions you raise			0
