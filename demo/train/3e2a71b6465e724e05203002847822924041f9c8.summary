-- the 19 - year - old @entity4 student with @entity5 who drew national attention for his fight to play football at his high school will be allowed to suit up his senior year , his father said thursday			1
the @entity11 approved @entity13 's request for a waiver to keep playing , even though he exceeds the state 's official age limit , according to his father , who said he learned the news from the athletic director at @entity19			1
the @entity13 family had been petitioning the school and athletic association to create a waiver process for more than 2.5 years			2
they were pushing to give the teen , who was held back in kindergarten because of his disability and turned 19 in january , a way around rules that banned students from participating in high school athletics if they turned 19 before september 1			1
" we 're proud of the way @entity34 advocated for himself and kids like @entity34			1
we 're very grateful for all the people , tens of thousands of people , that stepped forward , " @entity36 , @entity34 's father , told @entity0			1
the student 's underdog quest to keep playing sports in @entity4 's @entity43 garnered widespread attention			1
an online petition on @entity46 that was started on march 24 garnered more than 94,000 signatures			0
@entity48 , a t - shirt store in @entity50 , sold shirts that said " let ' em play			2
" on the football field and the basketball court , the 19 - year - old has shown flashes of athletic prowess , kicking an extra point near the end of a football game several years ago and hitting a 3 - point shot in the basketball playoffs to help his team maintain a comfortable lead			1
in may , after the @entity13 family 's lobbying , the athletic association created a new waiver process , allowing student athletes who turn 19 before september to play sports under " narrowly defined " circumstances			1
under the new waiver rule , a student " must have a defined disability documented to diminish both physical and either intellectual or emotional capabilities , does not create a health or safety risk to participants and does not create a competitive advantage for the team			0
the burden of proof rests with the school seeking the waiver , " the association said in a statement			0
the age restriction is intended to prevent the possibility of injury or competitive advantage from an older , more developed athlete playing against younger students			2
" the rule is 100 years old , " @entity36 told @entity0 in may			0
" we 've come a long way in those 100 years in this country in the way that we involve and include people with disabilities			0
and i think it 's time that the rule catches up with that			0
" @entity13 started practicing with the football team before the waiver was accepted , in hopes that he would be cleared			2
the rule change and waiver acceptance means he will be allowed to play as an extra point kicker on his high school football team			2
" and when football is over , he 'll try out for the basketball team he 's been playing on for three years , " @entity36 told @entity0 thursday			0
" thanks to all the people that signed the petition and spoke up			0
without them , this could n't have happened			0

the teen 's father says officials have ruled he can play , despite age limits
19 - year - old @entity13 has @entity5 and was held back in kindergarten
his underdog quest to keep playing for his school garnered widespread attention
