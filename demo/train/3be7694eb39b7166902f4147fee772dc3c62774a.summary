-- a seismic shift is taking place in the @entity4 political system			1
the series of bailouts and austerity measures implemented during the last two years has led to a fundamental political crisis affecting both the function of government and the standing of key politicians and political parties			2
sunday 's debate in parliament regarding the latest austerity and bailout package was marked by unprecedented scenes of tension both inside and outside the building			1
the bill passed but left both historic buildings in central @entity23 , as well as both major parties of the interim coalition government , in tatters			0
yet , it would be a mistake to attribute sunday 's destruction to the austerity measures -- similar events took place in december 2008 , well before any talk of a debt crisis had reached @entity4			1
what these events symbolize is the mainstreaming of extremism in @entity4 and the rejection of the rule of law			1
extremism -- both from the far left and from the far right -- is visible throughout the public sphere : it has permeated the political rhetoric ; it has polarized social groups against each other ; it is present in the everyday discourse of ordinary citizens who single - handedly condemn not only individual politicians but the institutions of representative democracy altogether			2
what the politics of extreme austerity does is to offer the ideal excuse -- the perfect cover -- for the further breeding of extremism			1
it looks as if public opinion in @entity4 can tolerate the continuous and widespread destruction of central @entity23 , but would not accept any police or state action that would contain those few extremist groups that cause mayhem			1
the reasons for this self - destructive pattern are historical and cultural			0
they stem from the long divide between left and right in @entity4 , which in fact goes back almost one century			2
right - wing governments -- either elected or imposed -- dominated @entity4 politics for much of the 20th century			2
the army and the police were instrumental in containing communism and suppressing the left , culminating in the 1967 - 1974 military junta which scarred the @entity4 psyche			1
in the minds of many @entity4 , police action is associated with the suppression of fundamental civil liberties			1
however , what many do n't see is that @entity4 has now reached the other extreme , in which the lack of law and order hurts those who need it the most			1
widespread tax evasion , which creates huge deficits , hurts pensioners and the working classes			0
ongoing strikes and protests hurt commuters , workers and tourists			0
greeks have a love - hate relationship with the state -- they have historically depended on it , while always trying to undermine it			0
the role of the state and of the public sector is usually at the heart of political debates between left and right			0
yet , for the first time in recent memory , the political battle lines in @entity4 are not drawn between left and right , but between the modernizers and the populists existing in most political parties across the spectrum			2
the modernizers support @entity4 's position within the eurozone at all costs and favor radical reforms , including a smaller and more efficient role for the public sector			2
the populists reject the austerity packages arguing that they will eventually lead to a default anyway			0
the former camp has so far failed to prove that austerity works			0
however , the latter camp has not offered an alternative			0
on sunday night , @entity130 carried two live feeds			0
the first feed was from inside the parliament building , showing a disconnected political class engaging in their usual micro-political infighting and self - congratulation ; the other feed was of ongoing semi-apocalyptic destruction in the streets of @entity23			2
the juxtaposition could not have been more telling			0
it bore a chilling resemblance to the last days of @entity145 's @entity144 in the 1930s			1
one thing is certain -- the political system in @entity4 is changing and the repercussions may well be felt across @entity150 and the world			1
sunday 's vote led to the expulsion of 45 mps from the caucuses of three parties			0
no political party now holds an absolute majority on its own			0
in addition to international skepticism , the @entity4 prime minister @entity160 is facing a power vacuum at the heart of the political system			1
while unelected , he has a unique opportunity to reframe the political debate and realign the political system utilizing an emerging social movement in support of stability , rationality and reform			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

for many @entity4 , police action is associated with the suppression of civil liberties , says @entity181
extreme austerity does offers the perfect cover for the further breeding of extremism , he says
*tv* feeds from inside and outside parliament ' bore a chilling resemblance to the last days of @entity145 's @entity144 in the 1930s '
