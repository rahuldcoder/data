@entity0 -- several major advertisers in the @entity3 are pulling advertising from the @entity3 's @entity6 newspaper amid a wave of public outrage over a phone hacking scandal			1
carmakers @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity14 are among those to say they are withdrawing adverts that were scheduled to run in the newspaper			0
other big firms , including cell phone providers @entity19 and @entity21 and utility firm @entity22 , say they are reviewing their position with regard to advertising in light of the turmoil over the allegations against media baron @entity30 's flagship @entity3 sunday paper			2
the scandal around the @entity6 widened wednesday , with the father of a victim of the 2005 @entity0 terror attacks saying his phone may have been hacked			0
that followed claims tuesday that its journalists also hacked into the phone messages of missing teenager @entity41 , who was later found to have been murdered			0
prime minister @entity44 called the allegations " absolutely disgusting			0
" @entity10 was among the first to act to distance itself from @entity6 , saying tuesday that it was " concerned by the serious nature of the allegations of past activities against the @entity6 , and the high level of public concern			1
" " while we are not prejudging the outcome of the ongoing investigations , we believe it is appropriate to suspend advertising in the @entity6 pending the outcome			1
in the interim , we will advertise in alternative media within and outside the @entity61			0
" @entity11 said it had suspended advertising in the @entity6 and would " reconsider its position pending the outcome of investigations into the allegations of phone hacking			1
" the @entity13 bank said in a statement its action was in response to public anger over the story			0
" in recognising and responding to consumer reaction , @entity13 has cancelled an advertisement in this sunday 's @entity6			2
this was a tactical decision in the short term whilst we carefully consider our longer term position and its implications			0
" carmaker @entity80 said it had no advertising planned with @entity6 and would not commit to any future advertising pending the outcome of formal investigations , " as a result of the seriousness of the continued allegations			1
" the scandal has prompted calls for a public boycott of the paper -- and its parent company @entity94 -- on social media sites including @entity92 and @entity93			1
a message at the top of the @entity97 , which had more than 5,100 members as of wednesday , said : " by boycotting this newspaper we can send a message that they are not above the law and their behaviour is heinous and despicable			0
" parenting website @entity104 also said wednesday it would pull the current advertising campaign for @entity108 , which is part of @entity30 's media empire , from its website -- at a cost of some £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 to itself -- " as members who are pretty much unanimously shocked and disgusted by the @entity6 's actions in hacking @entity41 's phone thought it incongruous that @entity104 was carrying advertising for @entity108 at the present time			1
" however , analyst @entity120 , of media research firm @entity119 , told @entity1 the cost of the advertisers ' actions and any public boycott to @entity6 and @entity94 was likely to be limited in the long term			1
" there 's not a mass of material revenue impact on the business short term , " he said			2
" reputation going forward will be tricky for them to manage and there could be longer term implications if more advertisers pull and they pull for a longer period of time -- but at this point , there 's very little impact , " he said			2
the loss of revenue for @entity6 as a result of advertising being withdrawn this weekend would be in the realm of tens of thousands of dollars , he said			2
" the question is , do more businesses jump on the band wagon effect , and suddenly does it extend through the inquiry for a significant period ? " he estimates that 40 % of total revenue for the @entity6 and its daily sister paper , @entity150 , comes from advertising , putting its value at about £ 260 million ( $ 418 million ) a year			1
responding to the phone hacking allegations , @entity30 's @entity153 said wednesday : " we are committed to addressing these issues fully and have taken a number of important steps to prevent them from happening again			0
" @entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 says it will suspend advertising in @entity6 pending the investigation
@entity104 , a leading website for mothers , is pulling @entity108 's advertising from its website
calls for boycotts of @entity6 appear on @entity92 and @entity93
media analyst says long - term impact is likely to be small unless there is a *domino* effect
