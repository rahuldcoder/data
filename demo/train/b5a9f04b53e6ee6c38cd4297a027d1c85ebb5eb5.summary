-- for the 2013 @entity2 , @entity1 was as attention - grabbing as ever			1
the 20 - year - old singer , who was a two - time performer during sunday 's ceremony in @entity5 , @entity6 , lit what appeared to be a joint on stage during her acceptance speech for best video with " @entity12			1
" wearing a white leotard and a furry shrug , @entity1 carried a @entity16 purse on stage with her as she accepted the award			0
although her @entity2 would n't fit in the clutch , she did try to make a little more room by fishing out what looked like a spliff and then proceeded to smoke it			1
the puff was n't shown during the @entity2 ' airing on @entity2 's flagship channel , and @entity1 has been quiet about her action on @entity27			1
on sunday night , she simply instructed her @entity27 followers to " stay in school & be kind			0
other than that have fun			0
" regardless , @entity1 ' smoking was a slightly more risque act during a relatively tame event , which featured performances from @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
yet , given that this was an @entity2 event , the night would n't have been complete if it did n't include a little twerking			2
that came courtesy @entity1 , who , for the second time in three months , took the stage at an @entity2 awards ceremony to perform her hit " @entity47			1
" while some might 've been expecting something just as scandalous as her now - infamous set at the 2013 @entity51 , @entity1 went in a different direction			2
instead of giant teddy bears , the 20 - year - old singer was accompanied by alien figures dressed in head - to - toe black , and she herself wore a skintight , knee - length silver dress rather than a onesie			0
@entity1 also swapped her @entity61 dancing partner , @entity62 , for a little person in a black latex catsuit			2
the twerking stayed more or less the same and was completely absent from her later performance of " @entity12			0
" @entity1 was clearly one of the night 's big draws -- she even came out first , ahead of the night 's @entity69 , @entity71 's @entity70 -- but she did n't lay claim to the entire show			1
@entity62 followed @entity1 with a rendition of " @entity75 " that had a cameo from @entity78 rapper @entity77 , and the night 's best female award winner @entity79 soon followed with a performance of " unconditionally " that found her suspended in the air			1
like the singers who went before her , @entity83 fully embraced the night 's theme of an " out of this world " space party , ending her performance in a glowing silver bodysuit			0
throughout the event , held at @entity5 's @entity93 , awards were handed out in obligatory categories such as best pop , rock and alternative , as well as @entity2 - specific honors such as top worldwide act and world stage			2
@entity102 , one of the @entity2 ' top nominees , took home the award for best hip - hop act , and was also named the global icon of the year			0
in between awards and performances , @entity109 's @entity108 made some comedic appearances , showing just how much can go wrong when his overly confident newscaster character is unleashed in the @entity6			0
this year 's show marked the @entity2 20th anniversary .			1
