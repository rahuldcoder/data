@entity0 , @entity1 -- the captain of the @entity6 cruise liner @entity7 " committed a tragic error , " but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship 's 3,200 passengers , the last survivor found aboard said wednesday			1
@entity13 , one of the ship 's officers , said he was on the darkened bridge with capt. @entity17 when the @entity7 hit the rocks off the @entity21 island of @entity22 the night of january 13			1
he broke a leg as the liner rolled and was found 36 hours later in a half - flooded dining room , suffering from hypothermia			2
" all of the members of the crew did their best			0
they made a good job , everybody , " he told @entity2 before his release from the hospital			0
but , he said , @entity35 " committed a tragic error			0
maybe he was too confident in his skills , and he relied too much on his knowledge of the ship			2
" at least 17 people died when the @entity7 ran aground and settled sideways on the sea bottom off @entity22 , with half of the vessel still sticking out of the shallow water			1
another 15 remained unaccounted for more than two weeks after the accident			0
@entity13 was the ship 's purser , the officer in charge of passenger accommodations and food service			1
he also oversaw the evacuation that followed @entity7 's grounding			1
@entity35 had invited him to the bridge to watch as he steered the ship past @entity22 in what the captain called " a salute " to the island town , @entity13 told reporters on his way out of the hospital			1
about a half - dozen people were on the bridge , which was darkened for night operations			2
he said he thought the ship was passing too close to the island , " but the captain drives the ship			1
he knows very well where he should pass			0
" " in this occasion , we can not say , ' captain , we are too near the coast			2
' we can not say that			0
in this case , it is best only to watch and nothing else			0
" @entity35 has said that after the impact , he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking and limit its list			1
the captain is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard			1
he denies the charges , saying his actions saved lives and dismissing prosecutors ' suggestions that he was going too fast			0
critics have also questioned whether @entity35 waited too long to give the order to abandon ship			2
@entity13 said that decision was up to the captain -- but once given , " everyone worked in the proper way			1
" " consider that the ship was leaning very fast , it was a little difficult for us to put the people in safe , on the life boats , " he said			0
most of the 3,000 - plus passengers and the ship 's crew of about 1,000 made it safely off the ship in less than two hours , he said			2
@entity13 told @entity2 that he was hurt when he was heading back to the muster stations where passengers assembled to leave the ship			1
" muster station @entity112 was completely evacuated , " he said			0
" i wanted to check if there was anyone left on muster station @entity116 when i was going there , in the restaurant , i had the accident			0
the ship was tilted , and it was easy to lose orientation			0
" @entity13 was half - submerged in the chilly water flooding the restaurant when found			1
he said he survived by sipping at a soft drink that he caught as it floated by , since the contents had not been contaminated with salt water .			0

@entity13 was on @entity7 's bridge when the ship ran aground
he said he thought it was too close to shore , " but the captain drives the ship "
