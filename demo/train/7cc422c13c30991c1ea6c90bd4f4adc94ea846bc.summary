-- a @entity2 judge friday struck down a law requiring voters in the state to show photo identification at the polls , saying the requirement imposed " unreasonable burden " on voters and represented " a legislative disconnect from reality			1
" state judge @entity14 's ruling comes nearly two years after civil and voters ' rights groups challenged the law , which gov. @entity19 signed in march 2012 , that never went into effect because of the court case			1
" voting laws are designed to assure a free and fair election ; the @entity26 does not further this goal , " @entity14 said in his ruling			0
@entity27 , lead organizer of @entity28 , called the ruling a victory for those who fought against what he called the hardships imposed by the requirements of @entity35 , as the law is called			2
" the issue of voter id has served to mobilize the electorate in @entity2 about the issue of voting rights in general as well as the specific of the mandate of @entity35			1
so it 's served a beneficial purpose in some ways but it really did threaten to put up barricades for many voters in @entity2 that did n't have the required @entity38 , " he said			1
@entity27 said the law would have " cost a significant amount of money " for municipalities to implement , as well as for colleges and universities to change student ids			2
" this is a tremendous relief , " he said			0
@entity60 , director of the @entity61 , called the decision a " huge victory for democracy			0
" " we are glad that the hundreds of thousands of voters that would have been disenfranchised by this law are no longer going to be affected had it gone into effect , " he said			2
but @entity71 , executive director for the @entity72 , a @entity73 - based group which backed the law , believes the issue will end up before the state 's highest court			1
" we 've seen places that this has been enforced like @entity80 where this has been enacted and practiced and there has been an increase in minority voting , " he said			2
" this law has never been given the opportunity to be in place in @entity2			1
we have never seen the terrible things that they say will happen			0
... people are burdened by a lot of things -- to go on an airplane , to go into a government building			2
it 's something you need to have in the 21st century			0
people are signing up for @entity98 with ids , why do n't we require them for something as simple as voting			0
" @entity2 was one of 31 states with some form of voter id measure in place ; and one of only a handful to require it to be a photo id			1
supporters contend the law would prevent voter fraud			1
but the judge wrote that there was " no evidence of the existence of in - person voter fraud in the state or that in - person voter fraud was likely to occur in the upcoming election			1
" " respondents also failed to establish a nexus between photo identification -- showing voters are who they say they are , and the integrity of elections -- when prior elections accepted a number of types of proof to verify identify , " @entity14 wrote			0
" the burdens the @entity26 entails are unnecessary and not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest			0
and the record is rife with testimony from numerous @entity2 voters whose right to vote will be -- and indeed already has been -- denied or substantially and unnecessarily burdened by the @entity138 law			1
" the controversial law has languished in a legal limbo since @entity19 , a @entity141 , signed it in march 2012			0
@entity19 's office has not returned calls seeking comment .			0
