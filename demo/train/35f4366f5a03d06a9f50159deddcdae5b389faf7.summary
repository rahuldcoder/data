-- never work with children or animals they say			2
but for artist @entity4 , who has previously photographed @entity6 's @entity5 , the opportunity to digitally capture super horse @entity7 in portrait was just too good an opportunity to turn down			1
after all , it 's not often you are given the chance to capture greatness			2
for an artist who has worked with supermodel @entity17 and diva @entity18 this was an assignment harder that it might seem			1
he spent two days with @entity7 -- the first horse he has shot -- to produce his otherworldly 3d image of the stallion			1
" on the light box he literally is luminescent , " said @entity4 of his work , set to be unveiled on @entity25 at @entity26 this weekend			1
" it somehow goes beyond the physical and into the spiritual			2
" this beautiful creature is a divine creation ... life is a pretty miraculous phenomenon that we 're all part of , it 's an unfolding miracle			2
an animal like @entity7 , if you contemplate it , is a divine creation			1
" @entity4 's striking portrait of the @entity5 -- entitled " @entity44 " -- was unveiled in 2004 and the photographer suggests sport 's foremost thoroughbred shares a magisterial quality with the world 's most famous monarch			1
the artist depicted the @entity5 in full white regalia with her eyes closed almost as if she was inhaling the essence of power			1
" they 're supreme beings with iconic status , " @entity4 told @entity0			1
" we were really interested in shooting icons , they do n't necessarily have to be human icons			2
" i saw it when i looked at ( @entity7 's ) head shot , you could see that this really was a great being			1
" for some reason it made me think of emperors on a coin , you get a profile shot of a head of state , somehow it was aligning with that contextually			2
" while @entity5 's reign is very much ongoing , @entity7 ended his two - year racing career with a perfect 14 - 0 winning record			1
he is now enjoying a lucrative retirement with trainers paying Â £ 125,000 ( $ 199,000 ) to breed their mares with ahorse " @entity7 is a superstar , " explained @entity4			1
" he 's got a huge following			2
it was a real challenge , to take it somewhere different in the land of equine images , portraiture and art. " i wanted to do something that portrayed @entity7 as extraordinary			1
he really is an octave about greatness			0
i wanted to convey the extremity of what he is			0
" the finished product , which is 1.2 meters wide and 90 centimeters high , is the culmination of months of work which began when @entity4 asked to photograph @entity7			1
" we got an enthusiastic response and they were terrific and made @entity7 available to me , " said @entity4			1
" we wanted to shoot the horse in direct sunlight because that would really show his coat			0
" we had about six days on standby waiting on the weather , we shot it in two days			0
in terms of post-production and editing it 's been about two months			0
" @entity7 might not be racing any longer but it did n't take long for @entity4 to understand why this horse transcended its sport			1
" you take the bridle off and this is a horse that is so pumped up that it will just go , " he said			0
" at that level it is just supercharged			0
that was my first challenge			0
" in the end i shot it in the stable			0
we did a lot of shots of the horse outside , but he was always being held back			0
he had so much vitality and energy			0
" he 's used to having photos taken of him , he 's a superstar			0
he actually likes the attention and you can kind of tell			0
" @entity4 is not the first artist to draw inspiration from @entity7			1
@entity6 surrealist painter @entity135 depicted the horse leaping out of a television set following its demolition of the field in 2011 's @entity140			1
the global spotlight is n't @entity7 's alone			2
@entity144 's " @entity143 " @entity142 retired in april this year with a record which puts her male rival 's in the shade , winning all 25 of her races			0
horse racing 's first lady earned legions of fans in her homeland of @entity155 , even gracing the cover of the country 's edition of prestigious fashion magazine @entity159			0
with the media glare focused almost constantly on these two champion horses , they have grown accustomed to the flash of cameras , and it 's just as well			0
to capture his final image of @entity7 , @entity4 first shot the horse with multiple cameras before conducting a complete @entity169 scan to produce a virtual wireframe of its body			1
the scan allowed @entity4 to build a virtual model of @entity7 , laying bare its physical prowess			1
" i really felt that in itself was really interesting , just to see the horse in wireframe , to see that construction , the power and the physique , broken down into geometry , " said the artist			2
" it was quite an unusual thing to look at ... the beauty of the animal is in the entirety of his body			0
i wanted to shoot the horse naked in all his glory , but could n't because of practical problems			0
" after making his first foray into equine photographer , @entity4 would prefer to revert back to human subjects for his next portraits			1
and after picturing three of the world 's most recognizable women , he 's looking to shoot two of the planet 's most famous men : @entity203 and @entity204			0
" @entity203 has been a huge influence on me artistically and he really strikes a chord with me , " said @entity4			2
" @entity204 for being of greatness , both are icons			0
