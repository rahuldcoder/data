now that you have kids , you 've probably realized that there was actually some sense behind all that advice your mother gave you			1
there is a lot of sense behind some of mama 's advice , but other adages are not quite right			0
maybe you can thank her for your perfect posture ( even though it took 4,567 reminders to stand up straight ) or for insisting on all those family dinners			0
then again , some things need not be passed down to yet another generation			0
@entity21 always said : eat more ! kids are starving ! that 's true , but probably not in your house			1
the clean - plate club is n't where it 's at anymore			1
it 's important to give kids the chance to stop eating based on appetite , instead of external cues like an empty bowl , says @entity35 , a pediatric dietitian at @entity36			1
it helps them stay attuned to their feelings of satiety			0
when they lose that connection , the risk of becoming overweight goes up			0
but moms would n't be moms if they did n't worry about their kids ' food			1
it 's never going to be easy to let go , but if you give them healthy options and allow them to eat when they 're hungry and stop when they 're full , the rest will take care of itself			1
@entity21 always said : do n't sit so close to the tv -- you 'll ruin your eyes actually , you wo n't , and neither will your kids			1
according to the @entity62 , children ca n't harm their eyes by sitting with their noses practically pressed against the flat - screen			1
watching close - up , however , may cause eyestrain , which can lead to headaches , says dr. @entity69 , a @entity71 , @entity70 , pediatrician			1
@entity72 does n't worsen vision , but it 's not comfortable , either			2
for healthier viewing , remind your children not to watch in total darkness -- the sharp contrast between the room and the tv can worsen strain -- and have them plop down about ten feet away			1
but if you have a child who 's always sitting really close , she may be having a hard time seeing			1
ask her to scooch to a more normal distance , and if she ca n't see the screen clearly , get her eyes checked			1
@entity21 always said : do n't read in the dark smart thinking			1
just as watching tv in a black void can cause eyestrain , so it goes with reading in low light , says @entity92 , a pediatric optometrist in @entity93 , @entity94			1
and if kids keep it up for long periods ( like your voracious reader , who sneaks in extra chapters with a flashlight under the covers ) , it can lead to intermittent blurred vision and headaches			1
all of these symptoms resolve with rest , but this behavior can speed the onset of nearsightedness in kids who are genetically predisposed , says @entity92			2
to protect their peepers , make sure kids have at least 60 watts of light to read under and encourage them to keep books ( and computer screens ) at arm 's length and to take frequent breaks			2

furrowing your brow millions of times over your life can leave a line or two eventually			0
there 's no way to avoid it , nor any reason to try			0
our facial muscles move to express emotion			0

slumping over puts major pressure on the neck , shoulders , and back , not to mention that it keeps the lungs from completely filling			0
but constantly scolding kids to correct their posture is frustrating			2
instead , try to keep your kids active , says @entity170 , a physical therapist and assistant professor at @entity173			2
it will give their muscles the strength needed to maintain alignment -- without nagging ! @entity21 always said : that music is too loud it probably is			1
if you have a kid who goes nowhere without her @entity184 , there 's a good chance she 's rocking her way to some hearing loss later , says dr. @entity188 , professor of otolaryngology and pediatrics at @entity191			0
if she likes her tunes loud , ask her to take a break every 20 minutes or so			0
you can also consider springing for noise - canceling headphones : they drown out background sounds , so she 'll be less tempted to turn it up			0
@entity21 always said : we 're having dinner together because that 's what families do she was onto something			1
kids are more likely to eat a balanced meal when the family dines together , says @entity209 , a clinical psychologist in @entity210 , @entity211			2
and it 's an all - around great way to connect			0
do n't stress if you ca n't do it every night ( who can ? ) ; instead , make the most of the time you have			1
parenting.com : 7 snacks that wo n't spoil dinner if you always get the same one - word responses , have the kids ask you questions about your day			1
or come up with a few very specific questions for everyone to answer , like what made you laugh today ? what was the nicest thing someone did for you today ? what was the nicest thing you did ? you might be surprised at how much you actually hear			0
@entity21 always said : eat your breakfast pass it down			1
there is no doubt that breakfast is the most important meal of the day			0
studies have proven that children who eat an a.m. meal perform better in school			2
plus , many breakfast foods are excellent sources of calcium , iron , and fiber , all of which tend to be lacking in many children 's diets			2
if your kids are picky breakfast eaters , have them grab a handful of raisins , some dry cereal , or even some leftover pizza to nibble on when they 're ready			2
@entity258 breakfast ideas @entity21 always said : put on a coat , you 'll catch a cold the only thing your kid is likely to get from being outside in the cold is ... cold			1
" when i was growing up , my grandmother insisted i bundle up in even slightly cold weather because ' getting cold could make you sick , ' " says @entity263 of @entity264 , @entity70			0
" i knew from my school health class that she was wrong and that germs make you sick			0
i let my own son play in the rain , sleep under a ceiling fan , and play soccer in short pants in freezing weather			0
he never had colds afterward ! " that 's because only cold and flu viruses cause those illnesses			0
there is some research that suggests that prolonged exposure to chilly temps may dampen the immune system because it puts a strain on the body			0
but that 's not the same as making you sick			0
so if your kid wants to tough out the chilly season in his skimpy but oh - so - hip hoodie , save yourself the fight			0
