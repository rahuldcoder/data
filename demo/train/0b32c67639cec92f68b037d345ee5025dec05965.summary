-- should you tell your kids ? this is the question all of us are grappling with this morning			1
the horrific @entity6 school shooting is inescapable on the news today , and will be for a while -- a constant thrum of horror in our hearts and our souls			1
but we 're grown ups			2
we 'll grieve and process and move on			1
still that one nagging concern remains for many of us : do we tell our kids what happened or not ? if the news is a steady presence in your home , chances are they 'll glom on to the fact that something is up			1
if we do n't tell them and get the facts straight , they 'll probably hear some version of the truth at school			2
but to tell them this ? how ? " adults like to have all the information and try to make sense of the horribleness			2
but for kids , it 's too much , " says dr @entity37 , pediatrician , author , health journalist , and ceo of @entity41 now			1
" we have to balance our need to keep up with our need to protect our kids			1
" when will these school shootings stop ? bearing that in mind , @entity37 , a member of @entity48 's @entity47 , has a handful of tips on whether -- and how --- to talk to your children about what happened yesterday			1
the ages of your kids will drive whether , and what , you tell them about @entity6			1
" the first rule of thumb , though , is never lie to your kids , " says @entity37			1
" if they come home and ask you about it , no matter what age they are , tell them the truth			1
if they 're 4 or 6 or 8 and they ask ' was there a school shooting and did people die ? ' your answer has to be yes			2
" then you reassure them			2
tell them that their school is safe , that your community is different , that there are protections in place and it will never happen to them			1
" even if you 're not sure that 's true , you have to make sure that they believe it			2
they have to go to school every day			2
" how to help survivors of the @entity6 shooting ask your kids what they 've heard			1
even if they do n't ask you about @entity92 , they do go to school with older kids			1
children catch wind fairly quickly when something serious is up			1
some kids will luck out and not hear anything at all			1
but the news flows like water -- it gets through cracks you do n't even know are there			2
and facts get twisted on the playground			0
" the only way you 're going to know if your kids have heard something is if you ask them , " says @entity37			1
when they 're as young as 4 , do n't bring it up			0
but a 7 - year - old will possibly have heard something			1
approach her during a quiet moment or at snack time , says @entity37			0
say something like " there 's been a lot of talk in our country that about something that happened at a school in @entity124 that was very upsetting			0
has anybody talked about that at school ? " if they have n't heard , let them know they can ask you anything they want			0
a @entity135 survivor , thankful for how much she still has remain calm			1
if you do tell them what happened , make sure you 're coming from your calmest , most reassuring place			0
" do n't overload them			0
do n't go on a whole speech about gun control or school safety , " says @entity37			0
they 're children and they may not know how to respond right away			1
they may look at you and go out of the room and do something else			0
maybe they 'll come back and ask questions later , maybe they wo n't			0
" allow them to have whatever response they have unless it 's interfering with their ability to go through the day , it 's all expected , " says @entity37			0
if the news is interfering with your kids or anyone in your family , " seek help right away , " @entity37 advises			1
this will usually manifest in a lot of anxiety and a lot of grief , anxiousness about the safety of their family			0
in more serious cases , physical symptoms could include headaches , stomach aches , inability to function as usual or a reluctance to go to school			0
" this is n't something you 'd want to wait out			0
" how to deal with nightmares monitor the media intake for everyone in the family			0
even if you only watch @entity0 when the kids are in bed , there 's the chance they may not be able to get to sleep and can hear the newscaster , the interviews			2
coverage of events like this can range from incredibly tactful to incredibly sensational			2
be aware of who is watching what around the home , says @entity37			0
that goes for grown - ups too			2
" you do n't need to watch the news 24/7 , " she adds			0
" that creates overanxiety in all of us			0
that 's the best thing you can do to honor these people			0
