-- the @entity2 economy exceeded forecasters ' expectations in february , adding 175,000 new positions			1
this is a welcome jump from the paltry 75,000 jobs gained in december and 113,000 in january -- which had constituted the weakest back - to - back monthly figures in three years -- but the unemployment rate edged up to 6.7 %			2
and we are still far off pace for the recovery federal officials would like to see as they scale back a massive bond - buying program			0
the fact is there is a fundamental shift underway that we must address to get the economy humming again : the steady substitution of human labor with computers			1
more companies are mechanizing positions traditionally reserved for flesh - and - blood workers			0
low - cost software is replacing blue - and white - collar jobs alike			1
a recent study by @entity29 researchers projected that up to 45 % of @entity2 jobs could be replaced by computers within the next two decades			1
@entity2 needs to adapt to this shift , or these lackluster job gains are going to become the new normal			1
and there is no better place to start than our schools			2
the fact is @entity2 teens are falling behind in key subjects that will prepare them for the new age of computing			1
in the most recent global education assessment , @entity2 's 15 - year - olds scored below the international average in math and about average in science and reading			1
furthermore , many of the specific skills our kids are learning in school today wo n't prepare them at all for the professional world they 'll enter			0
our schools need to change			2
and there is a clear strategy for how to do it			0
but first , the essence of the challenge			0
the first wave of professional technologies replaced physical laborers -- car production lines , for instance , evolved from a series of @entity67 and joes with specific technical proficiencies to just a handful of hyper - efficient assembly bots			2
today , processors and software have grown so sophisticated that they can replicate core cognitive functions once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans			0
you can now hire computers to do your taxes and trade stocks			2
and these replacement technologies usually operate at much lower cost and higher reliability than their brain - ware competitors			2
@entity89 scholars @entity87 and @entity90 have been particularly perceptive in formulating strategies for how @entity2 can adapt to this seismic shift in the labor market			1
they note it 's futile to try to outcompete ; the flip side of the @entity98 legend is that humans will eventually lose any direct competition with machines			2
instead , they point to a teamwork model exemplified in competitive chess			0
about a decade ago , programs like @entity106 started beating the top grandmasters on a regular basis			0
in response , there emerged what 's called " freestyle " chess , which pairs a human and computer together -- the machine crunches the numbers and the person consults on broader strategy			1
it turns out that freestyle teams -- even when they include a mediocre human player -- can beat the top computers and grandmasters			1
this pairing synthesizes what each partner does best for a more complete chess strategy			0
the key lesson here is that @entity2 workers need to be trained to complement the raw processing and networking power of computers with uniquely human facilities , like evaluating subtle social cues and crafting macro strategies			1
workers should use their wetware to amplify the software			0
this insight has clear implications for how to reform our schools so they can better prepare students for the new age of computing			2
first , classroom learning needs to shift focus from the accumulation of particular facts and figures -- how many countries are in @entity155 ? when did @entity156 arrive in @entity2 ? -- to a broader emphasis on flexible analytical thinking and strategizing			1
after all , most @entity2 already have instant access to the sum total of human knowledge in the phone in their pocket			1
what will distinguish the workers of the future is an ability to harness , filter and synthesize all that data			0
second , computers need to play a more central role in all learning			0
young people need to feel comfortable using machines to meet a wide variety of educational ends			0
third , schools need to teach entrepreneurship			1
seeing business opportunities and then executing on them is a skill			0
it can be learned like geology and history			0
young people need to be encouraged to take a critical eye to the world around them , find the inefficiencies and then problem - solve their way to potential solutions			0
do n't get me wrong : personality will be a key differentiator between machines and people for the foreseeable future			0
there will always be a role for the best - in - class customer service - orientated people with great personalities who can instantly establish an emotional connection to their customers			0
but the new age of computing is deeply disrupting the @entity2 labor market			1
by training the next generation of @entity2 workers how to complement -- not compete with -- these fabulous new technologies , our schools can ensure this country will flourish for decades to come			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

@entity217 : @entity219 up last month ; but this *conceals* reality about changing job picture
he says @entity2 must adapt to major *ongoing* shift of replacing human jobs with computers
he says @entity2 's *lagging* schools must focus on flexible thinking , computers , entrepreneurship
@entity217 : next generation should learn how to complement , not compete with , new technologies
