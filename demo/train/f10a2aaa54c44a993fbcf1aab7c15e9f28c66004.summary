@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 airstrikes aimed at @entity7 leaders in @entity8 have been " very effective , " with few civilian deaths as a result , cia director @entity3 said monday in a rare public acknowledgment of the raids			1
cia director @entity3 speaks about the fight against @entity7 at the @entity14			1
asked about criticism of the missile attacks by counterinsurgency experts , @entity3 said he did not want to discuss specifics , " but i can assure you that in terms of that particular area , it is very precise and is very limited in terms of collateral damage			1
" " very frankly , it 's the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the @entity7 leadership , " @entity3 told the @entity14 in @entity0			1
@entity8 has complained repeatedly about what it says are airstrikes on its territory by @entity5 - operated drones			1
the @entity5 military in neighboring @entity36 does not comment on the attacks , which typically target @entity39 militants in the border region , but the @entity5 is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote - controlled aircraft			0
@entity3 's predecessor , @entity45 , was asked about the drone attacks on @entity8 territory shortly before he left office in january , but addressed it far less directly than @entity3			1
" i 'm not going to talk about anything operational , and i 'm not confirming or denying how any of this happens , we 're not getting into that , " he said			0
but he said he believed @entity7 leaders had come to view @entity8 's tribal regions as " neither safe nor a haven			2
" two leading former advisers on counterinsurgency warfare , @entity59 and @entity60 , wrote in the @entity61 over the weekend that the strikes have killed about 14 terrorist leaders in the past three years -- but @entity8 sources say the civilian death toll could be as high as 700			2
while @entity5 officials dispute that ratio , @entity59 and @entity60 wrote , " every one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family , a new desire for revenge and more recruits for a militant movement that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes have increased			0
" " the persistence of these attacks on @entity8 territory offends people 's deepest sensibilities , alienates them from their government and contributes to @entity8 's instability , " @entity59 and @entity60 said			0
they compared the tactics to @entity85 bombardment of the same region in the 1920s and @entity89 airstrikes on @entity90 in the 1950s , arguing that the strikes were likely to remind @entity8 of colonial rule			2
@entity5 forces have been battling @entity7 and its @entity95 allies in @entity36 since the terrorist network 's 2001 attacks on @entity98 and @entity99			2
both have taken root across the rugged border in @entity8 , where @entity8 troops are waging an air and ground offensive to crush the @entity95 in the @entity106 , northwest of the capital , @entity108			0
prime minister @entity109 said monday that the offensive will go on " until peace is established			0
