-- @entity1 have become the first of the 10 current @entity4 teams to confirm their entry for the 2010 world championship			1
@entity1 have become the first of the current @entity4 teams to confirm their 2010 world championship entry			1
with the deadline for entries closing on friday , @entity1 have been forced to act , making it clear their position in no way undermines the unified efforts of the @entity16 in their ongoing debate with governing body @entity18 with regard to next year 's proposed rule changes			1
on sunday , the teams handed @entity18 chief @entity23 a letter in @entity25 demanding he scrap the 2010 rules , notably the budget cap and the prospect of a two - tier championship , in return for their commitment to the sport through to 2012			1
that was despite the fact @entity23 had earlier claimed that progress was being made in the on - going dispute			2
despite the continued furor , and with the clock ticking towards the deadline , @entity1 have had to step forward			1
" we can confirm we have submitted our entry for the 2010 formula one world championship , " confirmed @entity1 chief @entity41 to @entity42			1
" we have done that , because we have a contract with @entity48 's @entity47 , and also with the @entity18 , called the @entity49			2
" we extended that for five years up until the end of 2012			2
@entity48 has honored his obligations to us under that agreement			2
we have been paid in full for our participation			0
we feel morally and legally obliged to honor our side of that contract			0
" secondly , we are a @entity4 team			1
we do n't do anything else			0
it is something we have been doing for 31 years			0
it is very important for our employees , sponsors and fans to know we will be in @entity16 for next year and many years to come			0
" @entity41 is eager to stress @entity1 have not broken ranks with @entity16 , that the team remains fully committed to the organisation and their efforts to build a relationship with the @entity18 for a better @entity4			1
" we joined @entity16 last year , and we 're absolutely committed to @entity16 , " insisted @entity41			0
" @entity16 has done a tremendous job in many ways , such as reducing costs and helping @entity70 get through their difficult times over the winter			0
" a lot of credit for that must go to ( @entity77 president and @entity16 chairman ) @entity79 , as well as the other teams for their support			1
" we want @entity16 to continue their discussions with the @entity18 , who have made huge concessions , more than i thought possible			0
@entity23 has been very conciliatory			0
but what we have here is a marriage			0
it 's too important for everyone for that to break up			0
" with @entity77 the leading team in taking the fight to the @entity18 , the next few days are crucial to the future of the sport			1
@entity41 added : " we have 10 teams all committed to @entity4			1
" but the @entity18 is right in saying it is both necessary and opportune to create the opportunity for a number of new teams to come into the sport			2
" in that context we can not delay the entries			2
we are trying to be reasonable and find a sensible solution			0
