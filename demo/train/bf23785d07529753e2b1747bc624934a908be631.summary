@entity0 -- the build - up has been years in the making			0
from the cartoons that many of us watched as children , we envisioned a world where machines and robots would penetrate every aspect of our lives , where each household would have a @entity14 the robot to cook , clean , and put the kids to bed			0
well , for most of us that washed our own dishes last night , we know that we are not there yet			0
the questions are : why are n't we there yet and when will we get there ? well , the world of machines is real and it 's coming			0
many refer to it as @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , the @entity29 , or the @entity30			1
all of these terms describe the same thing : automated technology that allows machines to exchange information with one another , resulting in a tangible benefit			1
this exchange of information is rapidly changing the way we work and live			1
you likely benefit from this technology every day without even knowing it			0
@entity28 applications are guiding you in your connected vehicles to the nearest @entity46 , or allowing you to remotely monitor your home from a smartphone			1
the applications bleed even more heavily into the enterprise space where companies are using @entity28 solutions to do everything from tracking the position of a high - value asset traveling through @entity55 to controlling the flow rate of an oil pipeline in @entity58 from an office in @entity60			1

analysts and industry experts project that the @entity29 will grow from connecting about 100 million devices today to more than two billion devices by 2021 -- representing a staggering 30 % compound annual growth rate ( @entity78 )			1
do i think that this type of growth will become a reality ? yes , but there are a couple of complexities that will first need to be worked out			0
as a matter of fact , complexity is the first of two threats to @entity28 growth			1
many enterprise m2m solutions require months , if not years , and a significant financial commitment to get to deployment			0
with those daunting hurdles facing many technology decision makers , and despite an average return on investment at around 40 % , companies are deferring their @entity28 strategies			1
obviously , this has to change in order for @entity28 to reach its immense promise			2
we need to get to a point where implementing an @entity28 strategy involves a matter of hours or days instead of months and years			2
when that is a reality , then we will start to see the realization of what @entity28 can be for both enterprise and consumer use			2
read related : @entity113 's new , smarter network for the internet of things the second threat to @entity28 growth has to do with the shift in the mobile industry towards @entity121 networks			1
at first glance , that seems a bit odd			0
how could enhancing the technology that @entity28 sits on pose a threat to its very future ? as mobile carriers negotiate with limited spectrum to support @entity132 rollouts , 2g networks are often sacrificed			1
the problem created is that @entity28 applications not only lose support , but they face significant expenses to enter into a @entity138 system where their data usage does not come close to justifying the costs , not to mention the significant capital investment required for a pricey 3g or 4g compatible device			2
although i believe that @entity28 applications will evolve to a point where a @entity132 network will make sense , i do n't believe that we are there yet , nor will we be there for at least a couple more years			2
thus , @entity152 will have to remain an integral part of the growth of the industry for the time being , and fortunately there are carriers that have pledged ongoing support for @entity152			0
as momentum for the proliferation of the @entity29 builds to forecasted levels and enterprises and individuals enter this brave new world , there will be some bumps along the road			0
however , it will be a much smoother and quicker ride into the future if application providers can find easy - to - implement solutions supported by networks that meet their tactical and financial objectives			0
when we get to that point , then you might just be able to kick back a little and let @entity14 handle things			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity28 technology allows machines to exchange information with one another
100 million devices are already connected
industry analysts predict there will be two billion @entity28 - connected devices by 2021
long development periods and *adoption* of @entity196 has held technology back , says @entity182
