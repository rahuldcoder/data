-- one week ago , the @entity1 was taking up some of the most restrictive anti-choice legislation in the country			1
it was in the context of this bill that i said , " finally mr. speaker , i 'm flattered that you 're all so interested in my vagina , but ' no ' means ' no. ' " you can watch me say that here			2
my comment is made around the 1:50 mark , and you can see exactly how the legislators seated behind me reacted			0
while there was a scatter of applause from my colleagues , there were no dropped jaws , bulging eyes or fainting			0
in fact , the only remarkable thing about their response is that there was virtually no response at all			0
not until the next day			0
that 's when i got word that @entity34 @entity1 leaders had banned me and my colleague rep. @entity35 from speaking on the @entity1 floor			1
given my speech , i could only assume it was because i spoke to my @entity40 values or because i had said vagina			2
but later that day , rep. @entity42 told the press that what i had said was so vile , so disgusting , that he could never bear to mention it in front of women or " mixed company			1
" since we share the same religion , i 'm guessing he was n't referring to my kosher sets of dishes			2
even though @entity54 has a bachelor 's degree in biology and worked as a chiropractor , it was the word " vagina " that did him in			1
as a storm of protest grew against our silencing and women across the state started to rally around my use of the word vagina , @entity34 changed course			1
they insisted they had no problem with vaginas			0
@entity35 and i were being punished for our lack of decorum			0
we were accused of throwing a " temper tantrum			0
" take another look at the video			0
do you see a temper tantrum ? does that look like a group of people shocked by what we said or how we behaved ? @entity82 enters stage left -- or is it right ? when complaints about our banning picked up pace , republicans tried again			2
this time , their story was that i was kept from speaking because i said " no means no. " as @entity34 continued to throw mud against the wall to see what stuck , they only made it worse for themselves			1
thousands of women , not only in @entity97 but across the country and even around the globe , saw exactly what was going on			1
what they saw was a male - dominated legislative body going to great lengths to silence two women who dared speak in opposition to a measure that would limit access to our health care			1
they saw it , and they did n't like it			2
among the people watching this unfold was @entity117 , who wrote the award - winning play , " @entity120			0
" @entity117 , who has worked for nearly 20 years to empower women and undo the shame many of us are taught to feel toward our bodies , did n't just see a group of mostly male legislators freaking out about " vagina			1
" she saw them trying to shut women up at the same time they were trying to pass laws about our health			1
she would n't stand for it			2
that 's why she came to @entity135 this week to lead a performance of " @entity120			0
" thousands of men , women and children showed up to see it and show their support for @entity35 and me			1
in the aftermath of this , rep. @entity147 , whose job it was to issue the edict against me , said he " honestly had no idea it would become such an issue			2
" i find it amazing that a fellow legislator would n't understand why it 's outrageous not to just silence me , but my 90,000 constituents			0
i hope he and his fellow republicans get it now			0
if not , the election this november will surprise them even more			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			1

@entity97 state rep. @entity163 said " vagina " in addressing strict *anti-abortion* *proposals*
republicans *decried* use of the word ; banned her and a colleague from the @entity1 floor
women rallied to defend @entity163 , saying she was silenced for speaking out on health care
@entity34 men did n't get it , and if they do n't wise up , they will lose their seats , she says
