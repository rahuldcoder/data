@entity0 , @entity1 -- near the areas where the decomposing bodies of three young women were found wrapped in plastic last weekend , angry and frightened residents gather to rally and pray			1
" our women do not feel safe ! " one community leader yells			1
" we will protect our families ! " yells another			2
the community here has been badly shaken recently			2
in the past several years , @entity15 's metropolitan area has been the center of a series of grisly discoveries of missing , murdered , kidnapped , raped and mutilated women			1
the start of this week brought grim news to three families in @entity0 , as each learned their beloved daughter or mother had been identified as a victim of the city 's latest accused serial killer , @entity28			1
with the discovery of the three missing women 's remains , the question is being asked often here : what 's happening to women in @entity15 ? more questions than answers in @entity15 " we need for the president of the @entity44 to bring in the @entity45 to find these women , " said @entity39 , leader of a group called the @entity41			1
" we ca n't do it alone			2
we need them to come in and find these women			1
" @entity51 's group was created and named after the discovery of the victims of @entity54 , the so - called " @entity15 strangler " who was convicted of kidnapping , raping , and murdering 11 @entity59 - @entity44 women			1
@entity54 buried his victims ' battered bodies in and around his home , located on @entity63			2
@entity54 's victims were discovered in 2009 , though many had been missing for months , or even years			2
he is now on death row			2
@entity67 is a registered sex offender who has now been charged with murder in the deaths of the three women , all found near his apartment last weekend in @entity0			1
@entity28 , 35 , is currently being held in jail , with his bond set at $ 6 million			0
the investigation continues into whether there are more victims connected to him			0
this past may , @entity15 was also in the spotlight when three women missing for a decade were able to escape years of brutal bondage and rape in the home of @entity85 , who accepted a plea deal under which he will avoid the death penalty , but spend the rest of his life in prison			1
fast facts : @entity15 kidnappings officially , 54 women currently are missing within @entity15 's city limits , according to the city 's police department			1
that compares with four missing women in @entity100 , an @entity1 city of similar size			1
many of @entity15 's community activists who work to fight crime in their neighborhoods say the number of missing is much higher than the police website says			1
" i would predict that 500 women are missing in the city of @entity15 and @entity0 , " said @entity110 , leader of a group called @entity112			1
@entity15 police say they are doing the best they can and acknowledge their list of missing people is incomplete and difficult to keep accurate			1
the list does not include missing women from neighboring @entity0 , which has a separate police department			1
all across both cities , posters of the missing women can be seen , especially in impoverished neighborhoods			1
@entity125 is one of those missing women			1
she vanished without a trace last august			0
the single mother was raising a 10 - year old daughter			0
@entity125 's two older sisters have endured months of heartache and worry , spending endless hours searching for her			0
" not knowing where she is -- it 's a pain i ca n't even describe , " said @entity136 , @entity125 's older sister			0
" for months i would dream of her , seeing her in the mud , in trash bags , soaked in the rain			0
... i just want to have her back			0
i just want to see her			0
" @entity136 said she thinks the police have not done nearly enough to help them find @entity125			1
" on a scale of 1 to 10 , i would give them a zero , " she said			0
" they have not followed leads and have not done nearly enough			0
" the family of @entity153 agrees			0
@entity153 , who went missing in 1997 , would now be 55 years old			2
" we will not give up , we want to find her and bring her home , " said @entity154 gallery : the faces of some of @entity44 's missing @entity15 and @entity0 's officials and police defend their work over the years , but acknowledge the problem is very serious			1
" in the cities combined , there are far too many people missing , " said @entity166 , mayor of @entity0			1
many here believe the ever - growing number of missing and murdered women is tied to the recent economic crisis			2
across @entity175 , home to the @entity15 metro area , about 76,000 residences are vacant , according to @entity178 figures -- the wreckage left from the loss of jobs , and the foreclosure crisis			1
" i hate to say this , but in a sense , to a large degree , we have an underclass in the city of @entity15 of those that truly are disconnected from the social fabric , from the mainstream economy and society , " said @entity183 , an urban studies professor at @entity184			2
" they 're left without anything to grasp onto			0
" once a hub of the nation 's industrial might -- shipping out seemingly endless streams of iron , steel , machinery and automobiles from its perch on @entity207 -- the city that once housed nearly a million people now has barely a third of that population			0
the crisis has gotten so serious that civilians are now doing things that are normally left to the authorities			0
on wednesday , groups of local residents went into wooded areas and several abandoned homes in @entity0 , looking for bodies or signs of missing women who might have been kidnapped or assaulted			1
@entity221 helped lead the search			0
" the real heart of our city is our women , and if you ca n't protect our women , it 's not a city , " he said			2
why are women disappearing in @entity15 ? all over the @entity15 area , fliers were posted for a missing 18 - year - old named @entity234 , a regular at @entity235 , who went missing just this month after leaving her summer job at an elementary school			1
on wednesday afternoon , members of @entity234 's family stood on roads , as they do nearly every day , handing out fliers and missing posters , calling out " help us find @entity243 ! " that afternoon , the family learned @entity234 was no longer missing			2
she was dead , positively identified as one of the three women found in @entity0			1
hours later , family , friends and supporters gathered for a vigil at the same place where they had been searching for the young woman			0
" my baby is gone , " said her father , @entity254 , as he was consoled by friends			0
" that 's the reality of it all			0
now , when i cry tonight , i 'm not crying hoping i find her			2
i know where she 's at			0
i 'm crying because i miss her , and now she 's gone on			0
