-- in @entity1 , an impoverished village in @entity4 's northeastern @entity3 state -- scenes of trauma , confusion , intense grief			1
here , at the site of the school meal poisoning incident that has claimed 23 young lives and imperiled 25 others , thousands of people mill around , stunned , hungry for information			1
they listen to the procession of politicians that streams into the village to pay respects and make promises			2
but they can not offer what these people want most : answers as to how the government - mandated free meals , meant to nourish the community 's children , could instead have cost them their lives			2
@entity4 's school program : ambitious , but far from perfect four burnt out police vehicles fringe the side of the road , a sign of the simmering anger felt towards authorities over the tragedy			1
investigators had previously flagged issues with food safety at schools in the state , with one report in april from @entity4 's @entity44 noting that school food " was kept in open and dirty ground			1
" a fresh grave has been dug in front of the ramshackle , solitary classroom where 120 of the village 's children were enrolled -- an unambiguous sign of protest over the incident			2
there are many others buried nearby			0
above all this , the wails of grieving families pierce the air			0
@entity61 is inconsolable as she mourns the loss of her five - year - old daughter , @entity63			0
the wife of a migrant worker , @entity61 says her daughter had not wanted to go to school that day , and laments the fact she had even given her a paisa -- a sub-unit of @entity4 's rupee -- to attend			1
" why is n't anyone bringing @entity63 back ? " she cries			0
@entity72 anguishes over child poisoned by lunch : why are n't you coming back ? like many here , she has words of anger for the school 's principal , who authorities say has absconded together with her husband , and whom they are seeking to interview			1
@entity61 's grief eventually overpowers her , and her body goes limp			0
this is a poor village , in one of @entity4 's poorest states			1
locals live in simple dwellings made of clay			0
the school is the heart of the community , meaning that scarcely a family here has not been affected			0
even the school 's cook , @entity98 , lost children to the tragedy ; her husband , @entity102 , told a reporter from @entity104 , @entity0 's sister network , that two had died after eating the tainted food , while another remains in hospital			1
the settlement 's solitary water pump is where locals say they were first alerted to the commotion following tuesday 's regular midday school meal			1
school children had congregated there to wash their plates after the regular daily meal of rice and potatoes			1
on this occasion , however , they began vomiting and collapsing			0
the children were rushed to the local medical facility , but they could do nothing for them			0
they were transferred on to a larger hospital at @entity128 , @entity3 's capital , some four hours ' drive away			2
in @entity128 , despite the distance , the incident is being keenly felt			0
the city has been rocked by violent protests over the deaths , and at @entity128 state government school on friday , many children said they had been instructed by their parents not to eat any school meals , due to fears of further contamination			2
many ngos who deliver the meals to the schools have stopped providing them to some schools , out of fears of a backlash			0
while answers on the tragedy remain scant , one thing remains clear : it will be some time before any sense of normalcy returns to @entity3 .			2
