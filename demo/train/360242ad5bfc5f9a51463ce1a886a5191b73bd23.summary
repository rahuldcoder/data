-- of the two of us , @entity1 is the fan of professional football			0
and every football fan realizes football games are extremely violent			0
we are both also feminists			0
and every feminist knows the women 's movement denounces all forms of violence			1
for a woman who is a football fan , this can be hard to reconcile			0
so it was surprising to turn on the tv and find these opposing mindsets coexisting on the football field : tough , hyper - masculine football players were wearing pink , a color associated with women and girls , femininity -- and sometimes vulnerability -- and also widely known to represent breast cancer			1
who could not be delighted , at first , to see such an apparent break in gender stereotypes ? the @entity30 , it seems , has officially teamed up with the @entity31 with the " a @entity35 " campaign throughout october to fundraise and spread awareness about breast cancer			1
the campaign encourages women to get mammograms annually ( even though the current state of knowledge is that screening benefits fewer and harms more women than once believed )			2
does anyone doubt that the @entity30 's support of breast cancer awareness is mainly a strategy designed to give the impression that the @entity30 cares about women , and generate more female football fans ? after all , from a public relations perspective , the pink ribbon is worth its weight in gold			1
breast cancer has been the cause of choice for corporate marketers for almost two decades , sure to draw a crowd and profits			2
but there is another women 's issue , domestic violence , that touches many women and men , some of whom are professional football players			1
this , too , is an issue that would resonate with fans			0
and as it happens , " @entity73 " is also @entity72			2
might the @entity30 throw the power of its brand behind this problem ? it would be a profound gesture from a perfect pulpit			2
after all , the most recent high - profile discussions in @entity81 about domestic violence have centered on the violent actions of @entity84 , @entity86 ' running back , who was suspended from play when a video was released showing him punching and knocking out his future wife			1
but @entity84 is by no means the only professional football player identified as a batterer			0
even in very recent @entity30 history , again and again other star players have been implicated in violence in their personal lives , including @entity96 running back @entity95 ; @entity98 ' defensive end @entity97 , who was arrested last weekend on felony domestic violence charges ; and @entity101 ' wide receiver @entity100 , to name only a few			1
the incidence of intimate partner abuse in the @entity81 is alarmingly high : one out of three women experiences this kind of violence , according to the @entity107 and @entity108			1
since this violence is committed primarily by men , it can accurately be described as a men 's issue , too			2
think of the impact of having a bastion of hyper - masculinity , like the @entity30 , shining a light on it			1
of course the @entity30 has long been reluctant to focus on domestic violence			1
even a recent set of @entity120 's on the issue have been late in coming , short in duration and far from enough			0
indeed , the league has repeatedly avoided , minimized and downplayed players ' aggression on and off the field , responding only when negative press refuses to die down -- as in @entity30 commissioner @entity128 's finally admitting , weeks after revelations about the @entity84 abuse incident , that he 'd handled it poorly			1
@entity132 's live feed of @entity128 's remarks revealed a stream of @entity136 comments from players themselves who found his mea culpa to be pointless			0
this avoidance may be an attempt to manage public opinion			0
it might also be based in something psychologists call a shield of denial			0
simply speaking , denial is necessary for effective human functioning , to provide psychological protection from thoughts and feelings , such as the prospect of death , too devastating to contemplate for prolonged periods			0
shielding oneself in denial enables a person to get on with life , or with the game or the season			0
there is nothing unusual about this human process ; people prefer to feel good , not bad			0
but there are moments when it 's important , even necessary , to examine individual and cultural ideas instead of denying them			0
the painful truth about domestic violence is that it is harmful and terrifying and forces individuals to face an agonizing reality			2
under a shield of denial , people predictably avoid the emotional pain of realizing that domestic violence is going on all around us , including in the @entity30 itself			1
but by staying shielded , by not speaking out against men 's violence against women , we quietly accept it			2
there is a purple ribbon to denote @entity72 , but there is no ubiquitous ribbon culture to gather around			1
for the @entity30 to show it is serious about supporting women , why not lower the shield of denial about domestic violence and put the issue out there before the fans ?			1

@entity197 , @entity198 : @entity30 observing @entity199 in october
**writers** : @entity30 wants to draw women ; why not mark @entity72 month ?
@entity30 has had high - profile abuse cases ; intimate partner violence ubiquitous in @entity81 , they say
**writers** : @entity30 in denial on domestic abuse . it could do good to publicly take up cause
