-- it 's been called " something @entity2 would play on , " labeled a danger to players and derided over a lack of consultation			2
@entity9 's new blue clay courts have been the talk of the tennis world for all the wrong reasons			1
but is the furore justified ? after all , is n't this the same surface -- just a different color ? it 's the nature of sports stars to be hyper - sensitive about their office environment			1
as one @entity23 journalist argued , a malfunctioning computer can waste your morning 's work , but a ridge in a tennis court might spell the end of a career			2
the sport has undergone some of its most dramatic modernizations in the last two decades			0
let 's not forget the uproar when @entity35 , the electronic ball tracking system , was introduced in the 1990s			2
but if the controversy over the last few weeks has revealed anything about tennis , it 's that this is a game where tradition still looms large			2
@entity43 's baby the man behind the blue revolution is @entity46 billionaire @entity43			1
the former @entity48 doubles winner and manager to @entity50 has had a blue bee in his bonnet for a while			0
he pioneered the first blue hard courts at his indoor event in @entity56 -- a lead followed by the @entity58 and @entity60 opens			0
@entity43 argues the color increases the visibility of the yellow ball and points to scientific tests proving the contrast is at least 15 % better on blue than red			1
the fact it 's also the color of @entity9 's major sponsor , @entity70 insurance giant @entity69 , has not been lost on his critics			1
a court by any other name but really , it 's just a color right ? according to tiriac the blue clay court is made exactly the same way as the red , with bricks ground into tiny fragments and spread over the ground in two different layers			1
however , in @entity9 these bricks are stripped of their iron oxide ( the chemical that provides the original color ) and then treated with dye			2
@entity43 acknowledges the cost is almost double that of the red clay , but says the extra expense is worth it			2
he admits that improving the experience for television viewers watching his $ 10.6 million tournament was a major factor in the switch			0
players see red so what 's all the fuss about ? world no. 2 @entity103 's shock exit in the third round on thursday has only added fire to players ' complaints that the new surface is too slippery			1
the " @entity103 " -- @entity103 has won six of his last seven appearances at the @entity48 -- was beaten in a three - hour epic by fellow @entity114 @entity113			2
it ended a 22 - match winning streak on clay for @entity103 that stretched back to 2011 , and was his first defeat in 14 meetings with @entity113			1
" i never was in control of the match , i did n't know how to win a point , " @entity103 told reporters , before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed			1
but even before his huge upset , the 25 - year - old was critical of the new surface , tweeting : " the history of clay court was on red			1
it was n't on blue			0
only one person wins -- the owner of the tournament			0
" a slippery slope ? world no. 1 @entity136 also threatened not to step on @entity9 's blue clay again after he lost to @entity139			1
the @entity140 beat @entity103 in last year 's final , held on red clay , and he expressed his unhappiness with the new surface even after beating @entity70 qualifier @entity144 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 2 in his opening match on tuesday			1
" today i played my first official match on blue clay and i have to admit i was not very happy			1
next time i have to bring skates instead of shoes , it was sooo slippery , " the 24 - year - old said on @entity149			1
likewise , @entity155 player @entity154 tweeted : " after playing a match on blueclay court 6 i can say with full responsibility on my shoulders that it is the worst court of @ @entity161			0
" in the women 's draw , world no. 1 @entity162 also complained about the slide , telling reporters : " the surface is a bit slippery , but it 's the same for all of us			1
" it 's not just the texture of the surface raising eyebrows -- on the most basic level it just looks different			0
" @entity175 ! blue clay			1
. it looks like something @entity2 would play on , " tweeted player @entity177 , in what has become a catchphrase of the tournament			0
but it 's not all blue			0
@entity60 star @entity184 did n't see what all the fuss was about			0
" i have n't noticed a difference between the blue and the red clay			0
i think it 's the same , it 's just you do n't get as dirty , " she tweeted			0
technically speaking according to experts the lack of traction has nothing to do with the color but the implementation of the clay -- which has been playing much faster than usually expected on such a surface			2
@entity200 , a performance specialist to tennis stars including @entity203 , has been watching the action close - up in @entity9			1
" the problem is not the fact that the color is blue , even though the change from the traditional brown is quite a shock			2
let 's not forget the @entity213 changing court color from the green to that bright blue ! the players had a lot to say about that too , " he said on his @entity149 page			1
" it 's that the amount of clay covering the surface is lesser than normal			2
if you dig your foot into the surface and remove some of the clay , you will notice that the underlying surface is a hard rubber - like mat. when water is sprayed on the surface , it become slippery			1
this , in my opinion , is what 's causing the main problems			0
" former world no. 3 @entity239 tested the blue clay at @entity9 last year and admitted it did " look a bit slippery			1
" but the @entity242 , who retired last month , did n't believe it was a safety issue			0
part of being a pro tennis player is adapting to different surfaces , he said			0
and besides , the biggest challenge at @entity9 is n't the clay -- it 's the altitude			1
balls fly faster through thinner air and @entity9 is 650 meters above sea level			0
" i would say that grass courts and even the hard courts are a lot more dangerous than clay -- any clay , " @entity239 told @entity0			0
" regarding adaptation , tennis players face different surfaces on a weekly basis , every clay court is a bit different			2
i would say that the altitude in @entity9 creates bigger problems to players than the color of the court			1
" eyes on the prize ... no , the other prize the issue is n't just about @entity9 , of course			0
the tournament is seen as an important buildup to the real clay - court crown -- the @entity48			0
players have argued it 's difficult enough adjusting to the conditions in @entity9 , without then having to change their game at @entity48 at the end of the month			1
perhaps most galling for the top players is that they were never consulted over the controversial changes			0
" players should be agreeing to the change -- there should be some value in what they say , " @entity136 told reporters			0
" i 'm not blaming the tournament , it is fighting for its own interests			0
but the @entity292 should have done a better job on player rights in protecting what the players want			2
" @entity239 added that even when players did raise objections , they were ignored			0
" players were asked at the council meeting if they would support the idea of having blue clay courts			1
they clearly refused the idea -- only to see that the decision was made anyhow that the surface will be blue , " he said			0
the @entity292 has granted permission for a one - year trial of the tournament , and says it 'll be taking into account players ' feedback			1
judging by the response so far , @entity312 will have a battle on his hands to keep blue in 2013 .			0

@entity9 's new blue clay courts have caused an uproar in the tennis world
the *brainchild* of billionaire @entity43 , it was hoped the color would attract tv audiences
players complain about slippery surface , with @entity103 's shock exit adding fire to flame
after one - year trial , will @entity292 *approve* blue clay in 2013 ?
