-- @entity2 's leaks of classified intelligence already have him being compared to @entity4 of the @entity5 and @entity6 of the @entity8 fame			1
@entity2 felt compelled to leak valuable documents about the @entity11 's surveillance programs			1
the 29 - year - old was willing to give up his $ 200,000 job , girlfriend , home in @entity16 and his family			0
he boldly pronounced , " i 'm willing to sacrifice all of that because i ca n't in good conscience allow the @entity21 government to destroy privacy , internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they 're secretly building			1
" the uproar over the recent revelations about government surveillance programs has raised eyebrows and concerns across the political spectrum			1
many on the left have been surprised that most of the same policies ( now even the surveillance of @entity21 citizens and phone companies ) that president @entity40 initiated , are being used , and expanded upon , by the @entity42 administration			1
many on the right say it is government overreach and that @entity46 should have been briefed on the broad programs			2
although the cause for alarm in political or policy circles might have merit , the exercise of these authorities by the executive branch does , in fact , appear to be legal			0
once again , the war on @entity57 is pitting national security against @entity21 's longstanding commitment to the promotion of civil liberties and human rights			2
opinion : @entity2 is a hero the current threat by @entity57 and jihadists is one that requires aggressive intelligence collection and efforts			2
one has to look no further than the disruption of the @entity71 subway bombers ( the one being touted by @entity73 ) or the @entity75 bombers to know that the war on @entity57 is coming home to us , to our citizens , to our students , to our streets and our subways			0
this 21st century war is different and requires new ways and methods of gathering information			0
as technology has increased , so has our ability to gather valuable , often actionable , intelligence			0
however , the move toward " home - grown " terror will necessarily require , by accident or purposefully , collections of @entity21 citizens ' conversations with potential overseas persons of interest			1
an open society , such as the @entity21 , ironically needs to use this technology to protect itself			0
this truth is naturally uncomfortable for a country with a constitution that prevents the federal government from conducting " unreasonable searches and seizures			0
" @entity21 historical resistance towards such activities is a bedrock of our laws , policies and police procedures			2
but what might have been reasonable 10 years ago is not the same any longer			0
the constant armed struggle against the jihadists has adjusted our beliefs on what we think our government can , and must , do in order to protect its citizens			0
however , when we hear of programs such @entity123 , or the @entity124 getting phone records of scores of citizens without any signs of suspicious activities nor indications of probable cause that they might be involved in terrorist related activities , the @entity21 demand for privacy naturally emerges to challenge such " trolling " measures or data - mining			1
the executive branch , although particularly powerful in this arena , must ensure the @entity46 is kept abreast of activities such as these surveillance programs			1
the need for enhanced intelligence activities is a necessary part of the war on @entity57 , but abuse can occur without ensuring the legislative branch has awareness of aggressive tactics such as these			1
our founding fathers , aware of the need to have an energetic , vibrant executive branch in foreign affairs , still anticipated checks upon the presidency by the legislature			0
working together , the two branches can ensure that both legally , and by policy , this is what the citizens desire of their government -- and that leaks such as @entity2 's wo n't have the impact and damage that his leaks are likely to cause			2
as for @entity2 , regardless of how any of us feel about the national security surveillance programs at issue , he must be extradited back to the @entity21 for interviews and potential trial -- if for no other reason than to deter others from feeling emboldened to break the law in the same way in the future			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity2 leaked classified intelligence about government surveillance
@entity177 : enhanced intelligence activities are necessary in the war on terror
abuse can occur if @entity46 is not aware of tactics like data - mining , he says
@entity191 : @entity2 should be extradited back to the @entity21 for interviews and potential trial
