so far , 156 survivors have been taken to temporary shelters and clinics on the island			1
rescuers in rubber boats and local fisherman continue to search the water for remaining survivors in choppy sea within 5 nautical miles of the shore			0

it 's uncertain where the boat was headed , although @entity15 said @entity2 officials believe they were on their way to @entity48 waters near @entity49 to seek possible asylum			1
