@entity0 -- one of the first things president @entity3 did after @entity4 seized control of the @entity6 was to announce his intention to seek new @entity9 authority for military action against @entity11 in @entity12 and @entity13 to replace those passed more than a decade ago to wage the war on terror			1
the president said he would begin consultation with lawmakers on an @entity20 , or @entity21 , while @entity22 still control the @entity6			0
but he added , " it may carry over into the next @entity9			1
" the new found enthusiasm for engaging @entity9 could be viewed as either olive branch to the incoming @entity4 @entity6 to answer accusations he does n't consult enough , or a belief @entity4 will be more forward - leaning on granting authority that has made some members of his own party nervous			1
but it precludes what is sure to be a bolder role for republicans in @entity38 foreign policy			1
here are some of the things to watch as @entity4 take over the @entity6 majority in january : the players - the three @entity6 committees with oversight over foreign policy will now be chaired by @entity4			1
defense -- @entity47 ascends sen. @entity47 is widely expected to head the @entity48			1
he has long sat on the committee and also been its ranking member , but this will be his first time being in charge of it			0
as one of the staunchest critics of president @entity3 's @entity12 strategy , the gavel gives @entity47 a greater platform to push for more aggressive military action against but @entity11 and president @entity61			1
@entity47 would also play a key role in writing the defense authorization bill , which sets policies on everything from defense spending to weapons systems to military base closers			1
although the appropriations committees control the purse strings , @entity47 would have a larger say in how the @entity72 spends its money			1
the @entity75 veteran has blasted the @entity72 about what he considers expensive , outdated and ineffective weapons systems , and is expected to be outspoken on reforming @entity72 spending , he has pressed to replace defense budget cuts under sequestration			0
@entity72 press secretary rear adm. @entity83 said despite @entity47 's criticism on the administration 's handling of foreign policy issues , defense secretary @entity82 enjoys a " strong and productive " relationship with @entity47			1
that relationship would exist despite the public ringer @entity47 put @entity91 through during his 2013 confirmation hearings			1
despite his reputation for blunt talk @entity47 is also known for reaching across the aisle and officials believe restoring the failed 2008 @entity4 presidential nominee to a position of power could see a return to the statesman - like @entity47 of years past			1
foreign relations -- @entity103 is a deal maker sen. @entity103 of @entity105 is likely to replace @entity107 @entity22 senator @entity106 , who was n't seen as particularly friendly chair to the @entity3 administration			1
@entity103 has criticized @entity3 for being an " unreliable ally " and blasted the president for withdrawing his request to launch military strikes last year			1
@entity103 also wants the administration to get tougher on @entity115 president @entity114			0
despite his conservative credentials , @entity103 is known for his willingness to work with democrats on issues foreign and domestic and has a good relationship with @entity106 , the current chair			2
during an editorial board with his hometown newspaper the @entity123 , @entity103 laid out a thoughtful argument for broad @entity38 engagement in the world and suggesting he would support an increase to the @entity38 foreign aid budget			2
intelligence -- a fresh start with @entity131 sources say sen. @entity131 of @entity133 will likely take the gavel from @entity135 , who has had a rocky relationship with cia director @entity137			2
their disagreement is over the agency 's meddling into a @entity6 investigation into @entity143 - era interrogation techniques and a long - awaited report on the issue			2
the administration could actually find a friendlier chair in @entity148 on the interrogations report , as well as on surveillance programs and the use of drones			0
he also expected to be less forceful on pushing for reform of @entity156 data collection called for in the wake of the @entity159 revelations			0
@entity131 will also likely dive into the threat posed by @entity11 , including improving weak intelligence on the number of foreign fighters who may have @entity38 passports			2
@entity12 and @entity13 -- a debate on the use of force republicans supported president @entity3 's decision to order airstrikes against @entity11 in @entity13 and @entity12 this summer			1
and incoming senate majority leader @entity171 said wednesday he is open to a @entity6 floor debate on a new authorization for the use of military force ( @entity21 )			1
discussion is likely to intensify over what the @entity4 considers a tentative and ineffective campaign against the terrorist group			0
@entity4 charge that president @entity3 , by not acting sooner , contributed to @entity11 growth			2
they have argued that defeating the group now will require more boots and @entity183 on the ground , increased airstrikes in @entity13 and @entity12 and a no - fly zone and buffer zone in @entity12			0
republicans also want to more forcefully confront @entity12 president @entity61			0
there is also sure to be scrutiny of the administration 's plan train moderate rebels			0
the @entity195 has asked @entity9 to train 5,000 voted @entity12 rebel troops to take on @entity11 , and the current authorization for that program expires at the end of the year			2
incoming majority leader @entity171 said wednesday the @entity4 want to revisit the discussion with the president on his strategy			0
that strategy could include cooperation with @entity205 , which would create a new sideline debate on @entity207			0
president @entity3 wrote a letter to @entity205 's @entity209 pointing out the two countries both oppose @entity11			1
but the ongoing and troubled nuclear talks between @entity205 and the @entity212 stand in the way			0
@entity205 's nukes -- opposition to @entity3 's strategy the deadline for an agreement between @entity220 nations and @entity205 to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for easing some sanctions is weeks away			1
it 's resolution is far from certain			0
president @entity3 said wednesday world powers presented a " framework " to @entity205 for a deal			2
@entity6 @entity4 are opposed to any agreement allows @entity205 to continue enriching any uranium and could now pass @entity232 legislation which would effectively derail a diplomatic solution			0
if a deal is reached the @entity195 could choose to bypass @entity9 entirely			2
president @entity3 has the authority to suspend @entity38 sanctions without congressional approval , a move which could force republicans to more forcefully confront @entity205			1
@entity4 senators @entity103 , @entity47 , and @entity241 have already proposed legislation that would compel president @entity3 to submit any deal with @entity205 to a full up - or - down vote , and senator @entity245 of @entity246 said he would not " tolerate " a deal with @entity205 without such a measure			1
president @entity3 demurred when asked on wednesday , saying if there was a deal on the table he would engage @entity9			1
" i think that we 'll be able to make a strong argument to @entity9 that this is the best way for us to avoid a nuclear @entity205			2
" democrats could also make things difficult for @entity3 on @entity205			2
proposed legislation enacting even stricter sanctions against @entity205 is sponsored by @entity22 sen. @entity106 of @entity107 and @entity4 sen. @entity4 of @entity259			0
the @entity260 of 2013 would expand the number of blacklisted sectors of @entity205 's economy , expand the number of senior officials in @entity205 and penalize foreign institutions that do business with @entity205 's blacklisted entities			2
the @entity195 fears such legislation would push @entity205 away from the negotiating table , alienate it 's international partners and effectively kill the and deny president @entity3 what he had hoped could be one of the most important foreign policy achievements of his presidency			1
@entity115 and @entity277 -- more help for @entity277 ? there may be little practical effect of a new @entity4 @entity6 on policy toward @entity115			0
president @entity3 has already taking a tough line against president @entity114 over his actions in @entity277			2
republicans , particularly @entity47 , paint @entity114 as a dangerous enemy who must be contained and are likely to push against any future engagement with @entity115 and a return to a @entity289			1
republicans could also increase pressure on the @entity195 to provide arms to @entity277 to defend itself against @entity115 aggression and increase support for @entity295 and other emerging democracies in @entity297			0
@entity298 -- more difficult to close president @entity3 campaigned in 2008 on closing the @entity298 detention facility , calling it a stain on @entity302 's reputation around the world			1
those hopes are now all but gone			0
congressional restrictions prohibit the administration from spending any @entity72 money for transferring detainees for imprisonment or trail has tied the president 's hands			0
@entity4 are the most passionate opponents of closing @entity298 and are likely to continue to thwart the closure of the facility , pressing the administration to try alleged terrorists before military tribunals			0
@entity317 -- possible new partners for the @entity195 , this could be a potential silver lining of a @entity4 - controlled @entity6			0
two key trade deals are being negotiated			0
the @entity321 ( @entity321 ) is an expansive free trade agreement between @entity323 and @entity302			0
the @entity324 ( @entity324 ) is a broad free - trade agreement between the @entity38 and the @entity326			0
republicans could make those negotiations smoother by giving the president " fast track " negotiation authority , eliminating the need for amendments @entity22 are seeking on behalf of labor			0
while republicans may be reluctant to hand president @entity3 what would be considered major accomplishments , both trade agreements could result in greater @entity38 economic growth and jobs which are @entity4 priorities .			1

@entity3 has signaled interest in engaging @entity9 on the use of military force *abroad*
sen. @entity47 will likely head the @entity347
@entity47 and other republicans have been critical of @entity3 's foreign policy
