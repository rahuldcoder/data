-- rifts within the @entity2 could widen after the archbishop of @entity4 , who has condemned the consecration of openly gay bishops , urged a diminished role friday for the @entity9			1
earlier this month , a @entity11 , @entity12 , diocese ordained the rev. @entity13 , the first openly gay bishop ordained in the church since 2004 , when @entity16 took his post in @entity18			1
the @entity20 church has been criticized by conservative factions for openly gay ordinations			1
archbishop of canterbury @entity23 , the nominal head of @entity2 , shared his concern when @entity26 was consecrated , saying then that the move would further divide the 77 million - member worldwide denomination that includes the @entity9 in the @entity20			1
on friday , he made an even stronger statement in a letter to the communion			2
" our @entity2 fellowship continues to experience painful division , and the events of recent months have not brought us nearer to full reconciliation , " @entity23 wrote			2
" there are still things being done that the representative bodies of the @entity2 have repeatedly pleaded should not be done ; and this leads to recrimination , confusion and bitterness all round			2
" it is clear that the official bodies of the @entity9 have felt in conscience that they can not go along with what has been asked of them by others , and the consecration of @entity53 @entity13 on may 15 has been a clear sign of this			1
" @entity23 does not have the power to issue edicts like the pope , but he issued a five - page statement suggesting that provinces ( such as the @entity9 ) or national and regional churches that have broken agreed - upon " promises " should step down from participating in interfaith dialogues			1
he said they should also relinquish decision - making powers in a committee that deals with questions of doctrine and authority			0
following @entity16 's consecration , the communion leadership laid out three promises , or moratoria , according to the archbishop of @entity4 website : -- no authorization of blessings services for same - sex unions			1
-- no consecrations of bishops living in same - sex relationships			0
-- no cross-border interventions ( no bishop authorizing any ministry within the diocese of another bishop without explicit permission )			2
@entity26 has been in an open same - sex relationship for 19 years , a violation of the moratoria			0
@entity16 also was in a same - sex relationship at the time of his consecration			0
conservative anglicans have long called for @entity23 to punish the @entity9 by not inviting the church to the @entity96 , a global meeting of @entity2 leaders held every decade			1
@entity23 did not go far enough in his rebuke , a spokesman for a conservative @entity2 group said friday			0
@entity103 of the @entity104 said the @entity9 should n't be involved in any decision - making bodies within the @entity2 so long as it continues to ordain openly gay bishops and violate biblical teachings			1
@entity23 ' statement only keeps the @entity9 off of certain committees within the communion , @entity103 said			1
" @entity111 [ @entity23 ] knows he has to do something because he 's under pressure from all sides , " he said			0
" but unfortunately , the step he 's taken in our view is not strong enough			0
" bishop @entity118 of the @entity119 of @entity120 called @entity23 ' statement " significant " but " not as punitive as it might have been			2
" he said it was an affirmation of the three moratoria , and he made clear that other churches , not just the @entity20 @entity9 , will be affected for having broken promises as well			1
" many churches across the @entity2 because of conscience or their belief in what the holy spirit is up to in their local context have lived beyond the moratoria , " @entity118 said			0
" while the moratoria are still before us , such actions do have some ramifications			0
... if anything , i question the efficacy of the moratoria			0
" he added , " it 's another expression of how we 're trying to live with our differences with integrity and not alienate one another			0
i 'm still convinced there 's so much more that unites us			0

the @entity9 in @entity11 recently consecrated an openly gay bishop
the archbishop of @entity4 *warned* that divisions in the church would widen
he urged a diminished role for the @entity9 for violating " promises "
conservatives say he did n't go far enough
