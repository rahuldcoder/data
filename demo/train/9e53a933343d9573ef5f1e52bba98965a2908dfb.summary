-- forget shoot - em - up addicts -- video games are reaching out to the rest of us			2
the greatest symbol of this is the @entity8 console from @entity9			1
its innovative wireless control -- the @entity12 -- has even non-gamers excited as they swing it through the air to control , say , a tennis racket on the screen			1
@entity8 's @entity12 may play a pivotal role in bringing the visually impaired into the electronic gaming fold			1
but not quite everyone has been reached			0
one group is still largely ignored by video game makers : the blind			1
with that in mind , a team of researchers at the @entity27 - @entity26 in @entity28 set out this summer to make a music - based video game that 's designed for mainstream players and also accessible to the blind			1
appropriately , perhaps , they incorporated the @entity12 into the game - play , though it 's optional			1
the resulting @entity38 game , designed for the pc , is called @entity40			2
in it , players try to lay down different tracks in a song by swinging and waving the @entity12 in time with the beats			1
or they can just use keyboard controls			2
the game reminded this writer of my lack of any rhythm whatsoever			2
i used the keyboard version , where you 're instructed to follow the beat by hitting an arrow key			2
@entity56 a beat and you get an ugly sound			0
but i did start to get a little better after 15 minutes and was awarded occasionally by crowd cheers			0
it 's a fun game			1
and i got a kick out of it			0
so did 41 - year - old @entity65			0
for her , though , the fun is a bit more significant			0
" play is one of the ways in which people build relationships , " she notes			2
" it 's fun to take on the challenge of a game and take turns encouraging and laughing at each other 's sillier mistakes			1
that 's the experience i am really craving in a game -- the social aspects			1
" @entity40 is presently single - player only , and there 's no scoring system			0
but a multiplayer online version will be released in a few months			0
intriguingly , players in this version wo n't necessarily know whether their opponent is blind -- and it wo n't make a difference in the game			1
" ideally , they should n't even know that it is designed with the visually impaired in mind , since we want to make a ' mainstream ' game , " says @entity94 , a 25 - year - old grad student at gambit and the lead researcher on @entity40 , which is his thesis			1
that said , " after they find out that the game is designed to be accessible , it increases awareness , " he adds			0
though using the wiimote is n't necessary , @entity94 believes it 's a more fun and expressive option			0
from a development standpoint , getting the @entity12 to work with a pc game ( it 's meant to be used only with @entity9 's @entity8 ) was a considerable engineering challenge			1
and players who want to use the device will have to do a little extra work , as well , including linking a wiimote to a pc wirelessly via @entity118 signal ( instructions on how to do this are included with the game )			2
@entity65 believes @entity40 's use of the @entity12 makes it unique among accessible games			1
it 's also , as far as she knows , the first accessible music game for blind players			1
a startup called @entity128 offers online games , including poker , designed to allow play between blind and sighted users			2
for @entity65 , it 's important that games be mainstream and inclusive -- rather than " special " and for blind players			1
" i really get frustrated with the way blind people are portrayed as if they live in isolation from the rest of the world and have no sighted family or friends , " she says			0
media , which includes video games , " is something people share and participate in together , a way of building relationships and exploring feelings and attitudes about real life , " she says			0
for now , @entity40 is an " early concept prototype , " says @entity94			0
but " ultimately , we 'd love to bring the game to consoles , " he adds			0
" if we get the chance we 'll definitely move quickly on that			0
" the current version of @entity40 is available for free at the @entity26 web site			0

new *interactive* music video game developed for visually impaired
@entity8 's @entity12 controller or keyboard used to play
developers hope game will also be played online by mainstream players
