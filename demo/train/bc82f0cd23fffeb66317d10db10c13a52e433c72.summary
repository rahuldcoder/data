-- twenty years ago , @entity1 and the @entity2 rode to power on @entity4 with a slick " policy manifesto " called the " @entity6			1
" today , some @entity2 lawmakers are calling for another such " contract " with the hope that they can stimulate greater interest in @entity2 ideas and policies			1
frustrated with colleagues who seem more interested in attacking president @entity16 than in proposing new ideas , sen. @entity13 and others are seeking a reprise of 1994 , when @entity20 's platform touted five ideas that the @entity2 promised to pursue if voters gave them power in the midterm elections			1
but even if @entity2 move forward with a new manifesto -- which some in the @entity2 oppose in fear of overpromising anything in an era when @entity30 seems incapable of doing anything -- the product would have little effect on the big problem that @entity2 are facing			1
while @entity2 stand a good chance of retaining the @entity36 and regaining control of the @entity38 in the midterms , polls show that the @entity2 brand name is in big trouble and huge portions of the electorate do n't trust the party with power			1
this does n't bode well for future presidential elections , when many more voters turn out than in midterms , or for their long - term fortunes on @entity4			1
the problems facing the @entity2 are much bigger than anything a media - friendly set of promises can provide			1
over the years , the @entity2 have inflicted great damage on the image of their party			1
according to a new @entity64 poll , the difference between conservatives and liberals on many issues has shrunk dramatically			0
conservatives have lost the advantage they have enjoyed on issues such as gay rights			0
@entity64 predicts that voters will soon be reporting themselves as more liberal on social issues than conservative if the trend continues			2
even as much of the electorate has moved toward the center or even the left on social and cultural issues like gay rights and the legalization of marijuana , the official @entity2 has stood still , adhering to the ideas from the culture wars of the 1980s rather than adjusting to the realities of modern times			1
the same is true on immigration reform , where the party has hued to a hardline stance against a path to citizenship despite the fact that polls show strong public support for liberal legislation			0
there was a moment when @entity2 could have moved in a different direction			1
when he was in the @entity36 , president @entity97 , through his ideas of compassionate conservatism as well as his strong advocacy of liberalized immigration policies , did push his party to move away from hardline social conservatism , focusing instead on economic and national security ideas			0
@entity105 @entity2 blocked his agenda , while the controversies over @entity109 and how he handled @entity107 undermined his political strength			2
the republicans on @entity4 won the debate , and now the party as a whole is paying the cost			2
neither have @entity2 helped themselves with economic policy			1
ultimately , political parties ca n't thrive without the support of the middle class			0
republicans who have inhabited the @entity36 in recent decades , ranging from @entity123 's campaign to appeal to the " silent majority " to @entity126 's lure of disaffected @entity127 , have found different ways to let voters know that they would back the middle class			0
@entity123 railed against the tumult of the 1960s , appealing to middle - class white americans who he said were being ignored			0
even while courting business , he still accepted policies that helped them			0
recently , republicans have had more trouble making this work			0
their economic policies leave many @entity141 feeling that they are left out of the party			0
this is why that " 47 % " remark of @entity145 in 2012 election resonated so powerfully			0
@entity2 are still in better shape with their economic policies than on other issues , but that too is a fading advantage			2
they look more like the party of the 1 % at a time many middle - class @entity141 are struggling to get by			0
@entity2 have greatly damaged their reputation as a party that can or even wants to govern			2
polls consistently show that more @entity141 trust democrats than @entity2 to handle the major issues of the day			1
the @entity2 strategy of obstruction has been very successful at stifling @entity16 and rallying support among the party faithful			2
vicious attacks are a terrific way to motivate activists to get to the polls but not as good at winning broad support among more moderate and independent voters who want elected officials who can lead			0
many @entity141 have concluded that the @entity2 are more interested in obstruction than solving policy problems			1
although congressional obstruction can cause great problems for the @entity36 , as sen. @entity177 famously understood from day one of the @entity16 presidency , it is not a good way to build broader support for the party			0
it does n't look like the adults are in control of the room when republicans are in charge			0
no matter what they say , @entity2 still do n't look like a big parts of the @entity141 electorate			1
the leadership of the party is still white and still male , which does affect who voters think the candidates will support			0
a recent study by the @entity197 at @entity198 provided devastating findings for the party on this front , showing that the gender gap in terms of political candidates is huge even if @entity2 have made slight , very slight , progress in recent years			1
there are six times as many women , the study found , representing democrats as @entity2			2
the number of female @entity2 candidates running has declined since 2012 , despite a concerted effort by the party to bring more of a gender balance to the tickets			2
over time , @entity127 have steadily improved ( @entity216 ) their gender diversity			0
all of these problems point to the fact that @entity2 have some really substantial rebuilding work ahead of them in the coming years			1
if the party 's only solution is a five - point printout , they are unlikely to find themselves overcoming the leadership gap that they face			0
the @entity2 needs to do more than make promises ; the party needs to reconfigure some of its basic policy agenda to prove it has n't become a party that has left much of the electorate behind .			1

20 years ago , a policy manifesto helped @entity2 ride to power on @entity4
@entity234 says a similar *document* today would n't have the same impact
@entity2 need a major shift in their stance to attract younger voters , he says
