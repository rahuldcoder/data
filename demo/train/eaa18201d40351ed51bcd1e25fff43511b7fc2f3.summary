-- @entity2 has urged @entity3 to take legal action against a @entity3 employer accused of grossly abusing an @entity2 maid , @entity2 government officials said thursday			1
the 23 - year - old woman is recovering in a @entity3 hospital after being severely beaten , according to @entity2 consulate officials			1
the @entity2 @entity10 said thursday that it had followed up on the case , which has outraged many in @entity2			1
" at first , we already called the @entity3 ambassador here in @entity18 a few days ago to the ministry , and at that occasion we expressed the position of the @entity2 government , which condemns the act , inhumane act , against our nationals , " ministry spokesman @entity14 said			1
" we also ask the @entity3 government to ensure that they will be responsible for that and take appropriate action according to the law			2
" @entity30 went to work in @entity3 four months ago to support her family in a small fishing village in @entity2			1
she was tortured since the first day of her employment in a @entity38 household , said @entity39 , @entity2 's citizen protection consul in @entity3			1
" she was beaten badly			0
but she is recovering , " @entity39 said			0
a migrant rights group and @entity2 officials have said @entity30 also suffered from cuts to her face and possibly burns from an iron			1
" we are asking for justice , " said @entity39 , who added that @entity2 officials had reported the case to @entity3 police			1
@entity30 has been hospitalized since november 6 at the @entity50 in @entity38			2
@entity0 was not able to reach @entity3 officials for comment			2
offices were closed because of @entity54 , the annual @entity56 pilgrimage			0
@entity58 's case is one of several involving @entity61 migrant workers in @entity63 nations that have made headlines in recent months			0
last summer , doctors removed nails that had been hammered into the body of a @entity70 maid , allegedly by her @entity3 employers			1
human rights groups have expressed alarm about the poor treatment of these workers , though it has been difficult to document abuses of domestic workers that take place behind closed doors in private homes			0
a @entity83 report earlier this year said migrant domestic workers often face isolation and forced confinement that contribute to psychological , physical and sexual violence , forced labor and trafficking			0
@entity91 , a senior researcher for women 's rights at @entity83 , said the problem is compounded by the fact that @entity3 labor laws do not cover migrant workers and , often in such cases , justice has been slow or non-existent			2
" the overall justice system is riddled with problems , " @entity91 said			0
" it 's not good for @entity3			2
it 's much worse for migrant women			0
" on top of that , once a woman reports a case of abuse , she is then held at a shelter in her nation 's embassy until the case is resolved , said @entity91 , who has visited such shelters in several @entity63 nations			2
often , a woman could be held for months , maybe years , without being allowed to work , which deters many women from reporting abuse , @entity91 said			1
millions of workers from @entity61 countries travel to the @entity63 to make money and shed lives in their homeland that are rooted in poverty			0
@entity58 was one of them , according to the @entity127 newspaper			0
it reported that her parents were unable to support her and her four siblings and in july , after she graduated from high school , @entity58 left for @entity3 with the help of a labor recruiting agency			1
a statement from a migrant rights group said @entity30 's abusers ought to be punished			0
it urged the @entity2 government to take appropriate action on her behalf			0
the @entity2 government said it plans to send to @entity30 's uncle to @entity3 to be with her for moral support , the state - run @entity145 reported , adding that the government will help bring her back home			1
@entity0 's @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
