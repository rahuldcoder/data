-- with @entity2 instantly assuming the top spot among candidates for the @entity6 presidential nomination , it is no surprise that nearly every other man and woman on stage with him at last night 's debate took aim			1
citing his executive order mandating inoculations against a sexually transmitted disease that can lead to cervical cancer , @entity13 expressed outrage that @entity2 , she said , had " forced " " government injections " of 12 - year - old girls			2
@entity21 archly claimed that @entity2 's skepticism about a border fence was nothing short of " treasonous			1
" @entity25 accused @entity2 , his fellow @entity26 , of raising his taxes , increasing the state 's debt , and expanding the state government 's workforce			2
the most extended critique of @entity2 , though , came right out of the gate , from @entity34			1
@entity34 accused @entity2 of trying to scare senior citizens and ruin the @entity6 by calling @entity36 unconstitutional , a ponzi scheme and a failure			1
of all the jabs at @entity2 last night , these mattered most			0
@entity36 stands out as the most important topic generating substantive disagreement among the top @entity6 contenders			1
in a debate that vacillated between broad principles of national defense and the rule of law on the one hand , and small government initiatives conducted at the state and federal levels on the other , this particular exchange featured disagreements about one of the oldest , largest and most popular entitlement programs in the country			0
just as important , the exchange between @entity34 and @entity2 over @entity36 underscored their competing views about the meaning of limited government			1
in their first sentences about entitlement reform , these candidates stand together for reducing waste , slashing fraud and trimming the federal government			0
it is in the second and third sentences , though , that the differences become clearer			0
for @entity2 , power should devolve to the states , and the federal government should maintain operations over only those policy domains for which it has a clear constitutional responsibility			0
as he noted in his opening remarks last night , the very reason he wants to be president is to make @entity80 less consequential in the lives of @entity82			0
when asked later about @entity36 , @entity2 went out of his way to offer assurances that the benefits for current and near retirees would remain intact -- " slam dunk , guaranteed , " as he put it			2
but he persisted in characterizing the issue of @entity36 reform primarily as one of increased state control			0
" the issue is , are there ways to move the states into @entity36 , for state employees or for retirees			0
" @entity34 , by contrast , has proposed a variety of measures that in his view will shore up @entity36 without either increasing taxes or reducing the federal government 's involvement			1
though he did n't lay them out monday night , the components of @entity34 's plan include the raising of the retirement age , the creation of personal retirement investment accounts for younger workers , and the indexing of benefits to prices rather than wages , as is currently done			0
between the two at last night 's debate , @entity2 was the clear audience favorite			2
but should @entity2 win the nomination , we can expect president @entity122 to pick up right where @entity34 left off on @entity36			1
on the other hand , if @entity34 can survive a @entity6 primary season in which the median voter is vastly more conservative than in the general election , then the terms of next year 's debate about @entity36 will be vastly more conventional -- to the great relief of moderates and frustration of the tea party sponsors of last night 's debate			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .			0

@entity136 says front - *runner* @entity2 was target for @entity6 candidates at debate
he says @entity34 turned focus to @entity36 and @entity2 's @entity144 comment
he says @entity2 now says he *'d* keep @entity36 safe , then talks about moving it to states
@entity136 : @entity2 may be favored , but in general election @entity36 stance would hurt him
