@entity7 , @entity0 a neglected , weed - strewn field in a small @entity0 town where there are more horses than cars seems an unlikely setting for a major shift in government policy			1
but in the isolated town of @entity13 , @entity0 's first catholic church since the 1959 revolution took power is set to be built			1
" there is money to start , there is the construction material to start , there are the permissions to start , so everything is ready , " said bishop @entity16 , who oversees the diocese where the new church will be built			2
the @entity13 church has been 56 years in the making , ever since @entity28 took power and @entity0 became an officially atheist state			1
religious people fell under suspicion by the new revolutionary government , but none more so than those who belonged to the @entity34 , which was seen as being overly sympathetic to the @entity36 regime that @entity28 had driven from power			1
in the first years of the revolution , thousands of @entity34 priests were jailed or forced into exile , and church property , including the @entity43 school that @entity28 attended , was seized by the @entity0 government			1
only with the visit in 1998 of @entity48 to the island did relations between the @entity0 government and @entity34 begin to thaw			1
@entity50 again became a national holiday , and @entity0 faced less official discrimination for practicing their faiths			1
in december , @entity0 president @entity54 thanked @entity55 for his role in the secret talks that led to a prisoner swap between @entity0 and the @entity59 and the start of negotiations to restore full diplomatic relations			1
in 2015 , church officials said requests to build new churches that had long been ensnared in red tape began to receive government approval			0
while church officials said several new @entity34 houses of worship are in the works , the first will be built in @entity13 , a remote town at the end of a pothole - cratered road in @entity0 's westernmost province			1
the rev. @entity76 drives that road to @entity7 once a week to officiate @entity77 in a converted garage in the back of a house the church rents			0
he has lost count of the miles he has put on his green @entity84 as part of his ministry to towns throughout the province			0
when the new catholic church is built -- the first in @entity7 's history -- @entity28 said he would move to minster there full time			2
" i hope the church does n't stay within the four walls , " he said " that it will go farther than that			0
that with the building of the new church , there will be more people of faith , " @entity28 said			1
the @entity0 @entity34 desperately needs more followers in @entity0 , where in recent years the syncretic religion @entity103 , that mixes african religions with @entity105 , has exploded in popularity			1
the church in @entity13 will take about two years to build and when completed will hold 200 people , @entity28 said			2
most of the $ 50,000 collected so far for the new church comes from fund - raisers held by the @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113			0
" much of @entity112 's history and culture comes from @entity0 , " said the rev. @entity114 , @entity111 's vicar			2
" it 's absolutely fantastic they are building a new church , and i hope to be able to visit one day			0
" @entity114 said he was optimistic that recent changes in @entity121			0
@entity123 regulations would make it possible for his church to send supplies and building materials to @entity0 to help with the construction of the new church			1
as she makes her way down a path to attend @entity77 in @entity76 's converted garage , @entity129 said she has waited more than five decades for a church to be built in @entity13			0
@entity129 said she , her husband and two children were those relocated to the town during early 1960s when a triumphant @entity28 was still battling what he called " bandits , " holdouts against his revolution waging guerrilla warfare in the countryside			2
while there is no official tally , hundreds , perhaps thousands , of people suspected of plotting against the revolution were shipped to @entity7 to live in a form of internal exile			0
" it was a process to make a community for political prisoners , " @entity129 said			0
" they took our farm away and brought us here			0
" a lifelong @entity34 , @entity129 said one of the most devastating things about being forced to move 500 miles away from her home to a town she had never heard of was that there was no church			2
" having a church is very important , " she said			0
" many of the people here were brought up @entity34 and need a church			2
we were baptized and prayed when we went to bed and woke up , just like our parents and grandparents taught us			0

@entity0 @entity34 start building their first churches since 1959
religious *believers* had been seen as suspicious under the @entity28 regime
the new churches are desperately needed , @entity0 catholics say
