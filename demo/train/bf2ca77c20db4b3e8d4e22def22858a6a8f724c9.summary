editor 's note : @entity2 hosts " issues with @entity2 , " a topical event - driven show with a wide range of viewpoints that airs every night at 7 p.m. et on @entity6			1
@entity8 ( @entity6 ) -- it 's racing season in @entity10 ! the @entity11 is this weekend			1
then it 's the @entity13 and the @entity14			2
get out the fancy party hats and pop the champagne ! but it 's not a cause for celebration for @entity10 's horses			1
these magnificent , yet voiceless , creatures can not tell you about the exploitation underlying @entity10 's racing industry			1
where do thoroughbreds go after they lose one too many races , throw one too many riders or develop a limp ? many thousands of thoroughbreds end up being slaughtered for horse meat			0
the unpleasant truth is horse meat is eaten in @entity34 and @entity35			0
despite the myth that they end up knee - deep in grass on some idyllic farm , the reality is that horses are very expensive to keep			2
when they outlive their usefulness , they often are sent on a hellish journey that ends in a slaughterhouse			2
toward the end of the line , these horses are sold priced per pound			2
i 've bought perfectly healthy horses for a couple of hundred dollars just as they were about to be loaded on a slaughterhouse - bound truck			1
the fortunate few end up at a sanctuary			0
the others are bought at auction , end up in overloaded trailers and travel thousands of miles without food or water to the slaughter plant			0
some are dead on arrival			0
according to the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , tens of thousands of live horses are transported every year across the border to slaughterhouses in @entity68 and @entity69			0
part of the problem is that the horse racing industry breeds for perfection			1
for every stallion or mare that looks like a winner , an untold number of foals get left in the dust			0
as the saying goes , they ca n't all be winners ... and they ca n't all be riding or school horses either			0
there is a severe horse overpopulation crisis caused by overbreeding in the racing industry			1
it 's time for that industry to accept responsibility for its castoffs and take dramatic action to protect a species that has so loyally served humankind			1
they 've got the money to create enough retirement homes to accommodate all the horses that pass through their gates			0
horse lovers won a huge victory when @entity10 's foreign - owned horse slaughterhouses were shut down several years ago			1
before that , the @entity65 estimates 100,000 horses were being slaughtered every year in @entity10			1
ever since , horse slaughter proponents have aggressively campaigned to reopen such plants , despite public revulsion			0
for too long , @entity107 has been mulling over a @entity109 bill ( @entity110 503 ) that would " prohibit the shipping , transporting , moving , delivering , receiving , possessing , purchasing , selling , or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption , and for other purposes			2
" this bill passed in the @entity117 in 2006 , but languished in the @entity118			0
it 's time for compassionate @entity10 to send a wake - up call to their members of @entity107 and demand passage of legislation to end the wholesale slaughter of @entity10 's horses once and for all			1
then , the racing industry will be forced to do something about its addiction to breeding			1
the time to be oh - so - polite about the industry 's dirty little secret is over			2
this secret is out of the gate			0
now , the race to end the cruelty must begin in earnest			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity6 's @entity2 wants to save all horses in @entity10 from slaughterhouse
she says the racing industry is creating an overbreeding crisis
she urges *people* to *contact* their representatives to demand action on bill
