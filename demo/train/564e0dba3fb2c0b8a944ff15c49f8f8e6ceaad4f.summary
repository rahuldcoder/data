-- the @entity2 rainforest is so vast and full of life that even its defenders do n't know exactly what it is they are protecting			2
in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the @entity2 rainforest has been wiped out			2
" the wealth of biodiversity is so immense , we can not even estimate the amount we do n't know , " says @entity7 , @entity8 - based director for conservation for the @entity10			2
" every new expedition you do to the @entity2 , you might find one new species of fish			2
every other , you might find some new bird or frog			2
" the @entity2 rainforest , which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental @entity22 and stretches across nine countries , is considered the world 's richest and most varied natural habitat , with several million species of insects , plants , birds and fish calling it home			1
it also plays an important role in regulating @entity35 's temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air			2
but the @entity2 has been under pressure from outside forces for decades			2
in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out			2
@entity7 says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees			2
" we have been deforesting at enormous rates , " @entity7 says			0
the chief drivers of this deforestation are large - scale business interests involved in logging , mining , agriculture and , especially , cattle ranching			0
some of this activity is sanctioned by the government ; much of it is not			0
@entity56 estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal			0
the @entity2 rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction			0
the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) of the @entity65 estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest -- more than three times the size of @entity68 -- are lost each year because of clearing and degradation			1
the threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
@entity77 , for example , lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005 , according to @entity64			1
@entity79 lost close to 55 percent of its primary forests , @entity64 found			1
and @entity82 lost nearly 56 percent of its primary forests over the same period , the worst rate of forest loss in the world , according to @entity64			1
the destruction of the @entity35 's oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon , but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades			1
" worldwide , one - half of all forests we 've lost in the last 10,000 years has occurred in the last 80 years			1
half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years , " says @entity94 , @entity95 for @entity56			0
@entity94 says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market , not to meet local needs			1
" the timber market , and also for agriculture , mining : when it plugs into the international economic system , that 's when you 've got to watch it , " he says			1
@entity94 would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product they 're consuming was harvested			0
" if you buy wine and cheese , we can tell the region and the year			1
but forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side			1
there is no way to determine if something came from a well - managed forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery , murder , drug trade , etc. , " he says			1
while the story of the world 's old - growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction , forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas , such as the northeast region of the @entity22 and parts of @entity149			1
this thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species			0
" @entity154 is the only place in the eastern @entity22 where you have the potential for large - scale wilderness where wolves , lynxes , cougars , woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored , " according to @entity164 , executive director of @entity165 : the @entity166			1
" we could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the @entity170 woods as it once was			0
" with large - scale agriculture all but gone from @entity154 and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere , @entity164 's biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of @entity170			1
his proposed solution : create a national park			0
in @entity8 in recent years , the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the @entity2 's destruction			0
last october , @entity8 said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws			0
environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of @entity8 's currency against the dollar , making the country 's exports more expensive			1
the @entity10 's @entity7 is hopeful that @entity8 , with international help , will be able to protect even more of the @entity2 , an area he considers among the most vital natural habitats in the world			1
" we do have strong civil society			0
we do have more governance , " @entity7 says			0
" but we certainly need support from abroad			0
i do n't believe @entity8 can do this job alone			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
