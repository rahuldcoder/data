@entity3 police have sent the criminal case involving the nephew of prominent blind human rights advocate @entity6 to the prosecution , signaling a possible trial soon , as well as continued official retribution against the activist 's relatives , @entity0 and his family said			1
@entity12 , the nephew , was arrested in the city of @entity14 in early may and accused of attempted murder shortly after his uncle escaped more than 18 months of heavily guarded house arrest			1
the family has maintained that the younger @entity0 injured a few officials with a kitchen knife in self - defense , when they broke into his house in the middle of the night and attacked his family after his activist - uncle ran away			2
" the local authorities are now declaring war on justice and the conscience of the international community , " @entity6 told @entity26 over the phone from the @entity28 , where he is studying law at @entity30			0
" they 're trying to separate his case from mine , but that 's impossible			0
" @entity40 , the activist 's older brother and the nephew 's father , has n't been allowed to see his incarcerated son since his arrest			2
he said he learned from a government - appointed lawyer that police downgraded @entity12 's alleged crime from attempted murder to " intentional infliction of injury " when sending the case to the prosecution			1
" there has never been any fairness in this case -- they ignored the facts and refused to let us appoint lawyers for @entity12 in accordance with law , " the father said			0
" the whole thing is their revenge against @entity6 's escape , so i do n't have any hope for a fair trial			1
" an official with @entity14 's police department , who declined to give his name , told @entity26 that @entity12 's case is now " in the judicial process " and would not comment further			1
repeated phone calls to the local prosecutor 's office went unanswered monday			0
@entity6 's arrival in the @entity28 on may 19 -- along with his wife and children -- brought an end to a diplomatic firestorm between @entity83 and @entity84 that erupted after he fled from house arrest in @entity14 in late april and hid inside the @entity28 embassy in @entity83 for a week			1
in a video posted online after his escape , @entity0 addressed @entity3 premier @entity89 , detailing grotesque abuses -- including repeated beatings -- he said he and his family had suffered at the hands of local authorities during captivity			1
" a fair trial for @entity12 would be hugely embarrassing to the @entity14 authorities because family - appointed lawyers would want to bring in the years of unlawful persecution of @entity6 as relevant context and background , " said @entity96 , a @entity98 - based senior @entity97 researcher for @entity99			1
" that 's what the authorities want to avoid at all cost			0
" before and after leaving @entity3 , @entity6 has repeatedly said that officials from the central government have pledged a thorough investigation into his allegations against local authorities			2
he has also frequently expressed concern over the safety of his family members left behind			0
" i think this is the test , " @entity96 said of @entity12 's case			1
" as long as he is being detained in this manner without regard to law , it would be very difficult to be optimistic about the government keeping its promise to @entity6			0
" in 2006 the self - taught legal activist was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for " damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic			0
" his supporters have maintained that the charges were trumped up by local officials to punish his advocacy for victims of what he called abusive practices of the country 's strict family planning policy , including forced abortions and sterilizations			0
now @entity6 says @entity14 authorities are handling his nephew 's case almost exactly the same way as they did six years ago before his own trial			2
" @entity12 is becoming the second me based on the treatment he 's received in the past few months , " he said .			0
