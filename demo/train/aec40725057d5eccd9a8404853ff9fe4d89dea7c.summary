-- i was 5 years old and my dad and i were on our way to the neighborhood bakery to buy a loaf of bread			2
it was early on the morning of january 1 , 1959			0
a stranger stopped us on the deserted street right outside our second - floor apartment			1
@entity0 's @entity12 remembers his fear , uncertainty and excitement as a boy during the @entity18 revolution			1
" did you hear ? " he asked			2
" @entity18 dictator @entity20 had fled the country in the middle of the night			1
@entity23 would soon be in power			1
not many people can remember details from when they were 5 years old			2
but not many people have lived through what i did in the late 1950s			0
conversations with my parents have refreshed those memories			0
i remember a sense of surprise and excitement that morning , tinged with fear and uncertainty			0
my dad says i was tranquil and quiet			0
" let 's go back upstairs , " he said after hearing the news			2
" yes , let 's go , @entity42 , " my dad quoted me as saying			2
back in our apartment , we tuned the radio to a local station , which confirmed the news			0
my mother insisted we stay inside , saying there would be trouble			0
indeed , a short while later , we heard loud gunshots as rebels hunted down @entity20 officials and supporters door - to - door			1
that night , someone went up to our building 's rooftop patio , looking for a @entity20 supporter			1
i cringed , squatting next to a wall			0
i remember the terror i felt			0
that was the day the revolution triumphed			0
in two short years , @entity23 and his ragtag band of rebels had done what many considered impossible			1
they would soon march triumphantly down the spine of @entity18 from their rebel stronghold in @entity72 on the eastern end of the island to @entity75 to assume power			2
fifty years later , @entity23 , his younger brother @entity77 and other revolutionaries are still there -- but not so for the millions of @entity18 who have fled to the @entity81 and elsewhere			1
twenty - one months after that morning when we heard the news , my family and i would be among those refugees			1
it is fair to say that few @entity18 who lived through the revolution expected that outcome			0
@entity23 had been hugely popular and widely seen as a savior who would deliver @entity18 from 50 years of dictatorships and unstable governments			1
he had promised free elections and a return to constitutional government			0
the highly unpopular and much - feared @entity20 had been a major player in @entity18 politics since 1933 , when he and a group of low - ranking army officials took control of the government			1
a power - broker , @entity20 effectively ruled behind the scenes until he was elected president in 1940			1
he held power until 1944 , when he was defeated for re-election			0
@entity20 did not go away quietly			1
he was elected to the @entity105 in 1948 and was running for president in 1952 when he staged a coup after it looked like he would n't win			0
ruthless and dictatorial , he ruled with a bloody iron fist			0
@entity23 , meanwhile , had been a student leader at the @entity110 in the late 1940s , heavily involved in the violent and passionate @entity18 politics			1
on july 26 , 1953 , he and a group of about 100 followers attacked the military @entity115 in the eastern city of @entity117			1
the attack failed miserably and about half of the insurgents were killed			0
@entity23 fled to the nearby @entity122 mountains , but was captured a short while later			1
while on trial in late 1953 , he gave his famous " @entity123 " speech in which he said , " condemn me			0
" pardoned under a general amnesty in 1955 , @entity23 fled to @entity129 , where he continued to plot against @entity20			1
he formed the 26th of july movement , named for the date of the @entity115 attack , and gathered money and support			0
it was there that @entity23 met a man who would become a revolutionary legend , the @entity140 @entity139			1
in late november 1956 , the rebels set sail from @entity143 aboard an old yacht named " @entity145			2
" @entity23 and his group of less than 100 followers landed a week later in eastern @entity18 , where most of them were caught or killed			2
@entity23 , his brother @entity77 and @entity139 were among the handful who escaped into the @entity122 mountains , where @entity23 had sought refuge after his disastrous @entity115 attack three years earlier			1
the rebel leader won popular support among the peasants in his remote hideaway while urban dissidents sowed insurrection in the cities			2
adopting guerrilla warfare tactics , @entity23 and his followers were able to inflict stinging defeats on @entity20 's army , which was mostly composed of young , untrained and unmotivated soldiers			1
my mother , father , new baby brother and i lived in @entity117 during the revolution , near the @entity122			2
from a vantage point in the city , we could see @entity20 's planes bombing the rebel strongholds in the distance			1
we would see @entity20 's armed troop convoys leaving their garrisons in the morning , heading for the jungle of the mountains			1
there were whispered comments among @entity18 that the ambulances full of dead and wounded soldiers were returning under cover of darkness in the middle of the night			0
what happened during the revolution registered strongly on a young boy who was robbed of a normal childhood , but who grew up witnessing history outside his front door			2
i remember my dad coming home from work one day with a bullet hole in his car from a stray shot			0
i remember heading to the beach one day along a country road outside @entity117 and my dad unsuccessfully trying to push my head down in the back seat so i could n't see the body lying next to the highway , barbed wire strung around the man 's neck			1
i remember looking out the second - floor balcony of an apartment we previously lived in and seeing a car full of young men chasing a screaming woman down the middle of the street			2
the men 's arms stretched out of the windows as they pointed weapons at the woman			0
the woman and the men disappeared from view , blocked by the corner of the building , so i never knew what happened to her			0
that day , a major shoot - out broke out in the plaza in front of our apartment and my mother and i hugged the floor for safety			1
she crawled into the kitchen and got me a small glass of wine , which she had me drink so i would fall asleep			0
when i woke , there was quiet -- but no peace			0
another day , a car with four @entity20 secret police pulled up downstairs and the men got out , leaving the doors open and the engine running			1
they went into the business downstairs , searching for a @entity23 supporter			2
i do n't know what happened there , either			0
i remember a few days after the announcement of @entity20 's defeat , @entity23 started his procession down from the mountains and along @entity18 's central highway to the capital , @entity75			1
my parents were thinking about going down to watch the triumphant parade , but i asked that we not			0
i was scared of what might happen			0
a few days later , i remember watching our console black - and - white tv as @entity23 gave his first speech before tens of thousands in @entity75			1
i do n't remember his words , but i do remember a white dove that perched on his shoulder as @entity269 , a major revolutionary leader and cohort , stood by his side			0
every once in a while , @entity23 would stop and turn to @entity273 and ask him , " @entity275 , @entity269 ? " am i doing ok , @entity269 ? and @entity269 would answer , " @entity276 , @entity23			2
" ten months later , @entity273 ' plane disappeared over the ocean during a flight to @entity75 , and the whispering started			0
although it is widely held that @entity269 perished in an accident , many @entity18 started saying privately that @entity23 or his brother @entity77 had him taken out over political differences or because of a perceived threat from the charismatic revolutionary known for wearing a wide - brimmed hat			1
to this day , the @entity288 continue to pay homage to @entity273			0
an official logo for the 50th anniversary of the revolution bears a drawing of @entity23 and @entity269			2
and to this day , i remember the day 50 years ago that began with a journey for a loaf of bread that would change my life and that of so many others forever .			1

50 years ago , a stranger on a deserted street asks : " did you hear ? @entity20 is gone "
