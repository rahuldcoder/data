@entity1 , @entity2 @entity1 's @entity0 has always been a venue for surprises , usually first - time showings of advanced @entity8 military hardware			1
@entity8 's pathologically secretive defense industry normally shows nothing official of its weapons programs to anyone , which makes the biennial @entity1 expo the only chance to see what its weapons makers have been up to			1
much has been written in the past few years about @entity8 's defense sector developing increasingly more capable weapons systems that approach the capability of their @entity20 and @entity21 analogues			1
some @entity8 weapons , such as a full range of anti-ship and air - to - surface missiles , seem to show that its military -- the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) -- is equipped to challenge @entity29 carrier battle groups and potentially deny the @entity20 the ability to operate in certain areas of the @entity32			1
but questions remain about how battle - ready the @entity26 is and whether it can function in a modern , network - centric warfare environment			0
today 's battlefield operates on the premise that autonomy should be pushed down to the lowest level -- even down to the man in the field -- because time is of the essence			2
getting inside of the enemy 's " decision loop " is the key to victory			0
but , giving individual units the ability to make their own tactical decisions without their orders being delivered from several layers up the chain of command is an anathema to the " control uber alles " mentality of the @entity8 leadership			2
in terms of new weapons , the number one attraction at @entity1 this year was the new @entity64 - 31 fighter			1
it has generated a good deal of excitement as it 's the first time a new @entity8 military aircraft has been unveiled while still in the early stages of development -- we usually have to wait until after they start serving in the @entity26 's air force			1
the fc - 31 is designed to look like a stealth fighter aircraft in the class of the @entity20 @entity77			1
it is also the second , but smaller , stealth - type design to be developed by @entity8			1
the @entity83 's " @entity82 , " the @entity84 , first flew in january 2011 but has been shrouded in secrecy ever since			0
the fc - 31 " looks " stealthy and its shape mimics that of the @entity77 in some respects			1
but it is impossible to tell just how successful the @entity95 design team has been in developing an aircraft with a low radar cross section without knowing the materials used , the placement of the engines inside the aircraft , and how well the heat signature from the engines has been suppressed by the design of the exhaust nozzle section			0
like other @entity113 fighter aircraft , the fc - 31 is powered by @entity105 - made jet engines , in this case two @entity102 - 93 models , which are a specialized variant of the same engine that powers the famous @entity111 " @entity109			1
" there have been rumors that a team of renegade designers from the @entity111 bureau in @entity119 assisted @entity95 in the development of the aircraft , but a senior @entity111 official stated " no , as far as i know they [ the @entity8 ] completed this design themselves , and they seem to have done a good job on their own			2
" the @entity111 official may be correct			0
an aircraft of this type designed with @entity105 assistance would probably perform better			0
the @entity83 's flight routine shows that it " bleeds " too much energy -- so when it enters into a turn it begins to lose altitude			0
even during straight and level flight the pilot has to engage the engine 's afterburners in order to keep the aircraft from sinking to a lower altitude			0
these are defects in the aircraft 's aerodynamic design that a @entity105 design team would not have made			2
western aerospace analysts point out that the fc - 31 flown at @entity1 is a " clean " jet in that it is not armed , which means that an aircraft configured for a real mission and fitted with weapons would be even heavier and would perform even worse			1
so , why has the @entity113 chosen to exhibit an aircraft that is either overweight , underpowered or both ? it could be an oblique signal to @entity157 timed to coincide with president @entity159 's visit to @entity160 for the @entity161			2
the underlying message : " @entity8 is stronger than you think			2
" this would not be the first such example of @entity8 trying to use its defense industry to flex its muscles			0
in january 2011 , when the @entity84 first flew , then - @entity20 defense secretary @entity169 was in @entity160 for an official visit			0
his read was that the timing of the two events was in no way coincidental			0
unfortunately for the @entity26 , the gesture falls flat			0
many would have been more impressed by the fc - 31 in photos posted on @entity8 websites than after seeing it actually fly at the air show			1
looks can be deceiving , as they say .			0

air show provides rare *glimpse* of @entity8 's home - grown military hardware
@entity8 has made progress in weapons *technology* , but doubts persist on battlefield readiness
there 's much *interest* in its new @entity64 - 31 fighter , which is said to be " stealthy "
but some analysts believe it may be overweight and underpowered
