@entity7 , @entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- @entity22 photographer @entity21 has been documenting the long - term effects of the @entity24 since 2005			1
originally an architect , @entity21 came to photography as a freelancer for the international press			1
after years of drifting through the @entity30 landscape , shooting from the perspective of the skytalets ( a traditional @entity34 wanderer ) , @entity21 has seen the reality of the area with an intimacy few outsiders have been granted			1
following the earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of @entity42 in march , @entity21 watched as the damaged @entity44 power plant quickly threw the country into nuclear panic			1
what was once seen as an isolated and frankly unrepeatable incident , @entity24 has found a twin in @entity44			2
on april 11 , the @entity44 nuclear crisis was upgraded from a 5 to a 7 on the @entity51 , a level previously only reached at @entity24			2
in the wake of the compound disasters , @entity42 has been struggling to contain the nuclear fallout in addition to rebuilding the nation 's infrastructure and morale			2
residents of the area still can not access their homes to retrieve personal belongings and @entity42 officials have said it will be another 10 months , at the very earliest , that people can begin returning to the area			1
see the rest of @entity69 : @entity21 at @entity20 @entity20 traveled with @entity21 to the empty streets and abandoned homes surrounding @entity44 , where the eerie silence mirrors that at @entity24			1
one of the first photographers inside the zone , @entity21 set out to document the unfolding nuclear crisis and we set out to document him			1
officials who took part in the @entity24 cleanup a mere 25 years ago say they are shocked at how slow @entity42 's response has been			0
the @entity42 government has yet to ask for international help in the cleanup , seemingly determined to solve the problem on its own and so far making many of the same mistakes that were made at @entity24			0
" with the earthquake and tsunami , it was a catastrophe , but it 's more of an engineering catastrophe and we can fix this , " @entity21 says			0
" but you ca n't fix what 's happening at @entity44			0
people just do n't understand the whole scope of the matter ... "			0
