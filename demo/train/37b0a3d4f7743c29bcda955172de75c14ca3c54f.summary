@entity0 -- president @entity2 hosted a @entity4 reception monday in honor of @entity6 , but faced criticism for not keeping campaign promises to the community			1
president @entity2 signed same - sex benefits legislation earlier this month			1
" i continue to support measures to bring the full spectrum of equal rights to @entity16 , " the president said in a proclamation this month			1
" these measures include enhancing hate crimes laws , supporting civil unions and federal rights for @entity22 couples , outlawing discrimination in the workplace , ensuring adoption rights , and ending the existing ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' policy in a way that strengthens our armed forces and our national security			0
" but critics say it 's too little , too late			2
a memorandum signed this month by @entity2 means same - sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long - term care program , employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners , and children and same - sex partners of @entity44 employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations , according to the @entity4			1
but it does not extend full health care coverage , which would require an act of @entity50			1
" it seems to me at least to be a nice gesture , but a disappointment , " @entity54 , a senior editor at @entity55 , said at the time			0
" it will absolutely be seen as something good			0
but i think , for example , it not including full health insurance , that is going to put a real microscope on that question			1
you know , why not ? " @entity54 said , adding that memo applies only to federal employees , so most people will not be affected by it			0
the extension of health and retirement benefits to same - sex partners is prohibited under the @entity73			1
@entity75 president @entity74 said the entire memorandum violates the act			0
" president @entity2 's ... executive order uses taxpayer money to placate an angry portion of his base at the expense of the rule of law , " @entity74 said this month in a written statement			1
" this order raises the question of whether the president has the authority to ignore ( the @entity73 ) and bypass the legislative process			0
" @entity90 , the spokesman for the @entity91 , said the lack of full benefits in the june 18 memorandum shows a lack of commitment to the gay community			2
" that 's the part that just shows that the @entity2 administration really is n't serious about their promises to the gay and lesbian community			1
things like the health benefits , things like retirement benefits and coverage for spouses -- these are the core issues , " @entity90 said			2
he said @entity2 has had multiple opportunities to fulfill his promises to the gay and lesbian community -- including by repealing the military 's do n't ask , do n't tell policy and standing against the @entity115 motion filed this month in support of the @entity73			1
" here we are , several months after he 's been inaugurated , and we 've gotten basically nothing			0
so it is too little , too late , " @entity90 said			0
@entity2 said he still wants to repeal the act , as he advocated during last year 's election campaign			2
" i believe it 's discriminatory			0
i think it interferes with states ' rights , and we will work with @entity50 to overturn it , " he said			0
@entity2 frequently spoke in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the presidential campaign , but also has said he opposes same - sex marriage			1
in the run up to his inauguration , he declared himself " a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian @entity16			0
" given the support @entity2 received from the gay community during the campaign season , @entity54 said , so far the @entity2 administration has let gay and lesbian rights activists down			1
@entity2 got 70 percent of the vote from those who identified themselves as gay , lesbian or bisexual , according to @entity1 exit polls			2
" i think there is an overwhelming feeling that he has not lived up to expectations on these matters , " he said			0
@entity2 is the second @entity153 president to recognize the community			2
@entity155 designated june 2000 as @entity156 month .			0

@entity2 stops short of giving full health care coverage to same - sex partners
