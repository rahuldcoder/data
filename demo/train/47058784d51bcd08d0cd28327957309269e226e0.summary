-- the @entity2 - led @entity1 on the @entity4 terror attack shows no sign of backing down despite a report from another congressional panel that , according to a top @entity8 , found no intelligence failures around the deadly 2012 assault			1
" there is more work to be done and more to be investigated , " a spokeswoman for @entity1 chairman @entity12 told @entity0 on wednesday			2
shortly before beginning its august recess , the @entity15 , also led by @entity2 , approved its report on the militant attack on the @entity20 diplomatic compound in eastern @entity21 that killed ambassador @entity22 and three other @entity20			1
" our investigation found the intelligence community warned about an increased threat environment , but did not have specific tactical warning of an attack before it happened , " rep. @entity23 , the senior @entity8 on the intelligence panel , said in a statement after its vote			1
@entity23 said the finding is " consistent with testimony that the attacks appeared to be opportunistic			0
" other committee probes the intelligence panel , along with several other @entity1 committees , has spent the past two years interviewing witnesses and examining evidence about the @entity43 administration 's response to the attacks and the related controversy that has been a flashpoint between @entity2 and president @entity43 over his conduct of foreign policy			1
in a key finding , the @entity15 reached a conclusion on one of the most contentious issues -- the now - infamous talking points used by a senior administration official to describe publicly what had occurred			0
using that information , then @entity57 ambassador @entity56 explained in television interviews just days after the september 11 attack that it stemmed from spontaneous protests over an @entity64 film produced in the @entity20			1
there had been such demonstrations in other areas of the @entity68			0
@entity20 intelligence officials soon determined , however , that groups with links to terrorists planned and carried out the armed assault on a diplomatic facility and a @entity76 annex			1
a flawed process the committee report , according to @entity23 , found that " the process used to develop the talking points was flawed " and that they " reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis			1
" like an earlier report by the @entity84 , the @entity15 also found that there was no ' stand down ' order issued by the @entity20 military command in @entity88 , which sought to support @entity20 under fire in @entity4			1
@entity0 reached out to @entity15 chairman @entity90 for comment on the panel 's report but did not receive a response			0
@entity12 has said repeatedly that the @entity1 will review what other congressional committees have found , but also seek testimony from those who have n't done so yet			2
@entity12 told his hometown newspaper , the @entity99 , " witnesses who were previously unavailable or not interested in cooperating are now interested in cooperating			0
" he added that " the universe of witnesses is expanding			0
" @entity12 also indicated that the @entity1 would hold its first public hearing in september to hear how the @entity103 is carrying out new efforts on diplomatic security			0
broader mandate @entity12 spokeswoman @entity107 told @entity0 the committee 's " mandate is broader " than work done by other panels			2
" the chairman has repeatedly noted the @entity1 wants every relevant document and all relevant witnesses to ensure every relevant fact is uncovered			0
this is a fact - centered investigation and the committee will go where the facts lead , " @entity107 said			1
the plan now is to declassify the @entity15 report and make it public			0
a time frame for that , however , is not yet clear			0
where are the @entity4 suspects ? one of them appears in court many questions in handling of @entity4			2

@entity132 on @entity4 is will press ahead with investigation
another committee found no intelligence failures around the deadly 2012 assault
ambassador @entity22 and three other @entity20 were killed in the attack
it was first *blamed* on a spontaneous demonstration ; later , intelligence said it was planned
