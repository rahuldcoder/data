@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 has upheld @entity5 's redrawn congressional districts , and officials hope to have the changes in place for the november vote			1
the justices said in an unsigned opinion on tuesday that a divided three - judge federal district court panel had " misapplied the standards for evaluating " challenges to voting maps drawn by the state legislature			2
the case was thrown back to the lower court , which is expected to approve the changes in time for @entity20			1
@entity5 officials indicated previously they would use the redrawn map if they prevailed in court			2
all states are required to redo their voting boundaries following the recently completed @entity26			0
there are about 30 court cases nationally dealing with similar challenges			0
the issue before the @entity2 was whether population variances among @entity5 's three congressional districts were enough to violate the law			1
decades old @entity2 precedent has solidified the " one person , one vote " standard to ensure equal voting districts			2
precedent also requires states to make a " good faith effort " to achieve equality in voting districts , but that those districts need not be drawn with " precise mathematical equality			0
" the lower court concluded last january that the redrawn districts did not provide equal representation among seats for the @entity50			1
the state is represented by republicans @entity52 and @entity54 and @entity56 @entity55			0
the redrawn maps were used in may primaries			0
@entity5 's plan was approved by large margins in the state @entity62 and the @entity63 , then signed into law by @entity66 gov. @entity65			0
commissioners in @entity68 originally sued to block the state from carrying out its plan , saying other legislative proposals would better achieve lower population variances			1
@entity5 state officials told the @entity2 in their appeal that crafting a new map would be time - consuming , expensive , and cause " irreparable harm			1
" but the @entity2 's ruling signaled skepticism of the lower court 's insistence on " zero variance " in population between the districts			1
the redistricting process is inevitably political and partisan to some extent as the majority party in the state legislature seeks to achieve a map that will maximize its voting strengths			0
the case is @entity92 v. @entity93 ( 11 - 1184 ) .			0

@entity3 @entity2 *decision* *overturned* lower court ruling on redrawn voter map
state officials said they would proceed with new map in time for november *election*
issue was whether population variances in @entity50 districts were enough to violate the law
