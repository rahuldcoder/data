-- when artist @entity2 shows up for events , fans do n't only bring books or pictures for him to sign			1
they also bring their dogs -- mostly @entity7 -- to meet him			1
after all , @entity2 is the patron saint of those sleek , regal canines -- a man who has made a career around @entity7 imagery			1
now 70 , @entity2 has dabbled in various mediums and themes since introducing the world to @entity14 , his first pet weimaraner , in the 1970s			1
but his choice of muse has remained fairly constant throughout his art , and even in the dog bed he helped design			0
" he 's the reason so many people know about these dogs , " said @entity21 , who brought her 7 - year - old rescue weimaraner , chance , to see @entity2 at a recent author talk at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
" weimaraners are very people - oriented , " she said			0
" they love days like this when they can be outside with their families			0
" @entity2 was at the festival to promote " @entity35 , " his newest children 's book inspired by his blue - eyed pet @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
they 're the latest in a long line of @entity2 's canine muses that have inspired a robust collection of paintings , photographs , films , books and worldwide exhibits			1
@entity2 has had 3 - year - old @entity40 and 2 - year - old @entity41 since both were 8 weeks old			1
they share the @entity2 home with 13 - year - old candy and 15 - year - old @entity54 , a descendant of @entity55 , one of his most famous subjects			2
" @entity41 did n't seem like a little boy 's name			1
@entity64 seemed to suit the look , " @entity2 said in a post-panel interview in a nearby hotel lobby , pulling out his iphone to show off pictures like a proud parent			1
" how could you not do a book about her ? " he said , pausing on a closeup of of @entity40			1
" she 's so captivating			0
" the follow - up to " @entity72 " features a combination of paintings and photographs , a departure from the images of dogs in costumes and roller skates for which @entity2 is perhaps best known			1
it 's a format that suits his current lifestyle and artistic sensibilities , he said			0
it allows him to ditch the studio and production crews needed to stage shoots of dogs dressed as @entity90 or the @entity91			0
instead , he can paint the backdrop to @entity40 and @entity64 's adventures beneath the skylight in his lakeside home in @entity96			1
" it was great , because i could be by myself in my room , like i was when i was a little boy , drawing pictures , " he said , referring to his childhood in western @entity98			0
@entity2 shared the book festival stage with author - illustrator @entity103 for a discussion about why animals make such great subjects for books			1
every dog has its own personality , which guides how @entity2 portrays them , he said			2
he told the festival audience -- a mix of adults and children -- that he approaches children 's picture books the same way as everything else he does			2
he just makes art , using dogs			0
" i love the idea that @entity2 is n't thinking about picture books any differently from his adult work , that he 's approaching his books for kids with the same kinds of ideas and aesthetic concerns , " said author and panel moderator @entity123			1
" he seems to be an artist by nature and an author by default , and it shows			0
" @entity2 knows it , too			2
at best , he 's a " part - time " children 's book author , a fact that became apparent to him in the company of established children 's authors at the book festival			2
" i do n't have a tv show			0
you 're not going to have a huge following unless you have a franchise or a creature -- something that gets in your imagination , whereas i just kind of dabble in children 's books , " he said			0
" everything that i do is sort of that way , " he said			0
" i think it 's a product of being an artist in the ' 60s , where switching mediums was not alien			0
" do n't get @entity2 wrong -- he loves children			2
he has two children of his own that he also likes to show off in pictures on his @entity169 doing winter sports like ice skating and playing hockey			0
he also likes creating art with children , which he occasionally does in schools			0
they do n't care about impressing @entity2 the artist -- even his appearances on " @entity176 " with @entity55 are too far in the past to register with them			2
" they do n't care about doing a @entity2 piece			2
they just want to do a @entity183 piece , or disco dog , " he said			0
" their language is mesmerizing			0
" if he could be anywhere , unsurprisingly , he 'd be spending time with his dogs in the country , or taking photos of them in @entity192 , where he spends about half the year			1
dogs ' personalities shine through in front of the camera , he said			0
it was true for @entity14 , who became " very calm and interested " when @entity2 would point a camera at him			2
same goes for @entity40 and @entity41 , who " loves to be on top of things			1
" " you really fall in love with them taking their pictures , " he said			1
" you learn so much about them			0

@entity2 's latest picture book " @entity35 " features photos and paintings
the book was inspired by @entity2 's weimaraner *puppies* , @entity40 and @entity41
" you really fall in love with them taking their pictures , " @entity2 says
fans often bring their dogs to meet @entity2 at speaking *engagements*
