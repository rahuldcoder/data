for a group of radical anti-western militants , @entity0 is pretty good at luring westerners to its ranks			1
the latest is an @entity8 teen from suburban @entity9 who was allegedly on his way to join @entity0			1
@entity12 was stopped just before he was supposed to board a plane to @entity14 , authorities said			2
but he 's far from alone			2
last month , @entity8 authorities detailed their case against a @entity18 food store owner accused of funding @entity0 and plotting to gun down @entity8 troops who had served in @entity21			1
and a @entity23 man told his mother that he and his half - brother were going on vacation -- only to tell her later that they were fighting in @entity28			1
" some of the foreign fighters may not return as terrorists to their respective countries , but all of them will have been exposed to an environment of sustained radicalization and violence with unknowable but worrying consequences , " @entity29 of @entity30 wrote in a report called " foreign fighters in @entity28 " this summer			2
so what is it about @entity0 and its uncanny ability to recruit @entity4 ? here are five methods the group employs : it preys on a recruit 's sense of identity the recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark			1
for many , it boils down to a lack of a sense of identity or belonging , @entity29 said			1
" the general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in @entity28 suggests camaraderie , good morale and purposeful activity , all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism , designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self - esteem , " he wrote			2
and some are drawn by the desire to die as a martyr who would enjoy a sumptuous afterlife if they die fighting the " infidel " enemy			1
it appeals to their religious duty westerners waging jihad , fighting alongside @entity0 and other terror groups , is not a new phenomenon			1
the @entity82 and the @entity83 have been trying to stay ahead of wannabe terrorists since the 9/11 terror attacks			2
but what draws @entity8 to give up their comfortable lives in the @entity8 and travel to war - torn countries to fight ? an appeal to their sense of duty			2
it 's a message frequently posted by @entity0 on social media : " you have to join			1
it 's your religious duty , " @entity3 terrorism analyst @entity94 said			2
it operates a sophisticated propaganda machine @entity0 now operates the most sophisticate propaganda machine of any terrorist organization , said @entity100 , director of the @entity101			1
" importantly , the group also views itself as the now - leader of a global jihadist movement , " @entity102 said			2
" it turns out timely , high - quality media , and it uses social media to secure a widespread following			0
" @entity0 has a penchant for producing slick videos that resemble trailers for @entity114 action movies			1
one hour - long video showed a collection of bombings , executions , kidnappings and beheadings			0
as one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky , two men in the background of the video chuckle			0
" we are way behind			0
they are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies , social media , when it comes to video production qualities , and in disseminating their propaganda over the @entity138 , " said @entity133 , a former jihadi and author of " radical : my journey out of @entity140			0
" and it 's probably no accident that a knife - wielding man in the beheading videos of @entity8 @entity144 and @entity145 and @entity147 @entity146 and @entity148 had a distinctive @entity147 accent			1
it drives home the point that @entity152 can join @entity0 , too			1
it exerts a cult - like control when @entity161 heard an @entity0 propaganda tape , " it reminded me of the exhortations of @entity159 ' cult saying , ' come to @entity160			1
' and that keys in on one of the key principles of destructive cults , which is deceptive recruiting			0
" @entity161 is the founder of @entity161 , an organization dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior			0
" this is a political cult using religion and a perversion of @entity176 as the shield			0
but in fact it 's a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced - out followers			0
" video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home			2
it uses its successes as tool about 2,000 @entity4 have gone to fight in @entity28 , though it was not clear how many joined @entity0 in its quest snatch more land and how many joined moderate opposition groups battling the @entity28 government , a @entity193 source told @entity3 last month			1
but it 's the extremist groups like @entity0 that attract the most foreign fighters , @entity29 wrote			1
" they tend to be more inclusive , better organized and better financed than their more moderate counterparts , " he said			0
" they also tend to be more assertive and have more of an impact on the battlefield , and so enjoy greater local standing , which makes them still more attractive to foreign fighters looking to make their own impact			0
" @entity147 authorities believe at least 500 @entity147 citizens have gone to @entity21 and @entity28 , many of them to fight with @entity0 and other @entity140 groups			1
@entity23 authorities estimate more than 700 people have traveled from @entity23 to fight in @entity28 , according to @entity29			0
on sunday , fbi director @entity216 told @entity220 ' " @entity219 " that his agency is tracking a dozen @entity8 that have joined terrorist groups in @entity28			0
but it 's not all alarming news			0
concerned by the prospect of these recruits bringing home their angst and their ability to launch attacks , @entity224 nations are fighting back			1
some @entity231 countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as @entity0 , @entity29 said			1
a @entity236 official said an @entity238 messaging campaign is keeping disaffected youth from joining			0
" we have evidence that there are young people who are not joining because we have somehow interceded , " under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs @entity240 said monday			0
" they 're reading the messages , they 're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of @entity176 clerics who have said that this is a perversion of @entity176 , from the hundreds of @entity176 scholars who have said the same thing			0
" but @entity29 said elected officials might not be doing as much as they think			0
" policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own			0
" @entity3 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 has a penchant for producing slick videos that resemble trailers for @entity114 action movies
analyst : many recruits lack a sense of belonging ; some want a *lavish* afterlife by dying as a " martyr "
in each of the recent videos of @entity4 , the man with the knife has a @entity147 accent
there are concerns about whether @entity152 who join @entity0 could return home to carry out attacks
