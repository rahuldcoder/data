scientists racing to develop something that will stop the largest @entity3 epidemic in history are trying a variety of experimental drugs on patients			1
without a cure , the disease has killed at least 3,431 people and infected 7,470 at last count			0
the first person known to have been diagnosed with the disease on @entity15 soil , @entity16 , is receiving a drug called @entity18 , according to his nephew @entity19			1
so is the second @entity3 patient to be treated in @entity22 's @entity21 , freelance cameraman @entity23			1
" after looking at the data on this drug , collaborating with the @entity29 and @entity30 and speaking with the patient and his family , we decided this was currently our best option for treatment , " dr. @entity24 , medical director of the @entity21 , said in a statement tuesday			1
" every patient is somewhat different , and we believe @entity18 is the best choice			1
" the biopharmaceutical company @entity38 got approval from the @entity30 for emergency use of @entity18 on @entity16 on friday			1
@entity16 is currently in critical condition in @entity42			0
the experimental antiviral drug was initially being developed to treat life - threatening viruses like smallpox			1
but antiviral drugs can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases			0
this is the same drug that was originally denied to @entity51 , a 7 - year - old who was treated for cancer and then developed an adenovirus that nearly killed him			1
in march , his parents launched a social media campaign to get the medicine , and it drew national attention			0
@entity51 then received the drug and recovered			2
after the @entity3 outbreak started this spring , @entity38 sent brincidofovir , to be tested against @entity3			1
test - tube data showed positive results			2
further tests are being planned			0
here 's what else is in the pipeline to fight @entity3			1
' @entity69 ' race for @entity3 vaccine raises ethical questions @entity72 @entity73 is in the early stages of developing its drug , @entity72			1
it was given to the @entity15 taken from @entity78 to @entity79 in @entity80 for treatment in august			0
a total of seven patients got the drug , and it seems to have had success			1
in july , the @entity86 gave @entity87 additional funding because of the " promising results			0
" in animal studies , the therapy seemed to help			0
four monkeys infected with @entity3 survived after getting @entity72 within 24 hours after infection			1
two others survived after getting the treatment 48 hours after infection			0
in the @entity79 patients ' cases , dr. @entity97 did n't get the drug until he 'd been sick for nine days			1
after just an hour of receiving the medication , @entity97 's condition improved dramatically			0
his labored breathing got better , and a rash faded away			0
one of his doctors described the transformation as " miraculous			2
" @entity107 also received the medication , but her response was not as immediate			0
after a second dose of the medicine , her doctors said , there was significant improvement			2
since the drug is so new , there are no doses of it left			1
the @entity119 contracted with @entity87 to make more for early - stage clinical safety studies			0
creating the drug is time - consuming and expensive			2
scientists are looking for alternative ways to create it using the tobacco plant			2
in august , @entity127 - based @entity126 started working with @entity87 to develop @entity72 using its plants			1
@entity129 - @entity3 this year , the @entity30 approved the use of the experimental @entity3 drug to test on suspected cases of the infection			1
@entity3 was used on dr. @entity134 , the patient taken from @entity78 to @entity135 for treatment in september			1
he had been working as a doctor in @entity138 when he became infected			0
the drug is made by @entity140 , a @entity141 company			2
studies in 2010 funded in part by the @entity15 @entity146 's joint project manager @entity145 office showed " 100 percent protection from an otherwise lethal dose of @entity149 , " according to @entity140 's website			2
in january , @entity151 started phase i clinical trials on the drug , testing it on a small number of human subjects			1
testing was put on hold after a volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after getting a high dose of the medicine			0
in august , the @entity30 modified its status to a " partial clinical hold " so @entity140 could give the drug to doctors or hospitals that requested it in emergencies like @entity171 's			1
in march , the @entity30 gave the drug a fast track designation , allowing the testing process to be sped up			2
@entity151 was also given the authority to use it under the investigational new drug application rule , so patients could be treated outside a clinical trial			1
a vaccine the @entity180 started human testing of a vaccine to prevent @entity3 in early september			1
the @entity15 @entity146 is working with a company to develop a vaccine as well			0
after an expedited review by the @entity30 , researchers were allowed to start a human safety trial			0
because there is such an urgent need for a vaccine , the @entity30 waived some of the preclinical studies that are normally required			0
the vaccine was created by @entity194 and the @entity195			0
it 's being tested in the @entity15 and will be tested in healthy volunteers in the @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			2
the @entity180 is also in talks with health leaders in @entity203 , which has seen 20 cases , to test the vaccine on people there			0
an international consortium that formed to fight the epidemic gave money to the company to make up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while the trials are ongoing			1
another vaccine developed by the @entity216 , licensed to @entity218 - based @entity217 , is also about to start trials			2
it will be tested at the @entity221 at the @entity222			2
that trial should start in mid-october			0
the process is being accelerated , and the @entity30 will be monitoring the results to see whether it can move into the next phase			0
the @entity141 government shipped 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine to @entity138 at the government 's request			2
an earlier version of that vaccine had been given to a @entity235 lab worker in 2009 after he thought he pricked himself with a needle that had the ebola virus on it			0
he did not get sick			0
a third vaccine developed by the @entity180 was tested in primates			0
it showed success in the animal study , in combination with @entity245 , an adjuvant used with other vaccines to boost the body 's immune response			1
other alternatives a doctor in @entity138 is trying an hiv drug called lamivudine			0
dr. @entity254 has given the drug to 15 patients ; all but two survived			1
compared with the 70 % mortality rate in @entity78 , those are good odds			0
the drug can cause liver problems and has other side effects , but the doctor said it has been worth it in light of the disease 's deadliness			0
scientists in @entity269 believe they 've found a new type of antibody that is effective against the virus			1
the team of doctors at @entity275 are confident that it will work and the side effects will be low , but it has not been tested in animals or humans and is at least a year away at least from being developed .			1

scientists are using an experimental drug , @entity18 , on two @entity3 patients
@entity72 showed promise in patients , but there are no doses left
several vaccines are in trials
@entity269 doctors believe they 've found a new antibody , but it has not been tested
