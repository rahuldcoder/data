in what his campaign billed as a " major foreign policy speech " monday , lasting about 20 minutes , @entity1 presidential nominee @entity0 took on president @entity6 's handling of protests in @entity8 after disputed elections three years ago			1
demonstrators were met with deadly violence by the government			0
" when millions of @entity8 took to the streets in june of 2009 , when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world , when they cried out , ' are you with us , or are you with them ? ' -- the @entity23 president was silent , " @entity0 said			1
the facts : @entity6 's initial response to the protests became a source of controversy at the time , and his political enemies have brought it back up at various times since			1
in the very first days of the @entity8 protests , the president did not weigh in publicly			1
after more and more images of violence surfaced , he condemned the actions of the @entity8 government , and later toughened his talk			2
complete coverage : @entity39 the non-partisan @entity49 describes it this way : " while @entity6 initially opted for a muted response , the @entity8 regime 's violent crackdown of opposition supporters complicated his administration 's attempt to balance outreach with its defense of human rights			1
" assessing the accuracy of @entity0 's attack requires a look at the timeline			1
on june 13 , 2009 , @entity8 announced that incumbent president @entity56 won a landslide victory			1
his main opponent , @entity58 , had already alleged blatant violations			0
after the announcement , angry crowds of @entity58 supporters took to the streets			0
the protests continued the next day as @entity56 supporters turned out by the tens of thousands to hold counter-demonstrations			0
@entity39 's @entity69 , on the streets of @entity68 , reported on " riot situations , lots of marches , people shouting ' down with dictatorship			2
' " scores , or even hundreds , of riot police were deployed , and there were " running battles between some of the street protesters and some of the riot police , " @entity69 reported			0
" and we 've seen people who have been hit with batons and taken refuge in people 's homes along the march route to try to get out of the way of that			0
" by the next day , june 15 , @entity58 supporters were holding the country 's largest protests since the 1979 revolution			0
@entity0 calls for strong @entity23 role in world affairs that day , june 15 , @entity6 gave remarks on the situation			1
he said he was watching the news from @entity8			2
it is " up to @entity8 to make decisions about who @entity8 's leaders will be , " he said , adding that " we respect @entity8 sovereignty and want to avoid the @entity23 being the issue inside of @entity8			1
" but , @entity6 said , " i am deeply troubled by the violence that i 've been seeing on television			2
i think that the democratic process -- free speech , the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values and need to be respected			0
" he said it was his understanding that " that the @entity8 government says that they are going to look into irregularities that have taken place , " and emphasized that he would continue to seek diplomacy with the country			0
just over a week later , on june 23 , after more and more images of violence came to light and amid some calls for the president to take a tougher stance , he did just that			2
" the @entity23 and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats , beatings and imprisonments of the last few days , " the president said , adding that he strongly condemns " these unjust actions			0
" the undecided : what will sway them ? asked why he would not spell out potential consequences for @entity8 over its behavior , the president replied , " because i think that we do n't know yet how this thing is going to play out			2
i know everybody here is on a 24 - hour news cycle			0
" an analysis for @entity145 said @entity6 was attempting to balance realism with idealism			0
others have used similar terms as @entity0 to describe the president 's initial handling of @entity8			1
" his silence validated the mullahs , despite the blood on their hands and the nuclear centrifuges in their tunnels , " presidential hopeful @entity152 alleged last year in the race for the @entity1 nomination			0
conclusion : during the first couple of days of the protests and violence , @entity6 did not weigh in publicly , but by a few days in , he was not " silent " -- and a week later , took a tougher stance			1
@entity6 ad : @entity0 is ' reckless ' with foreign policy fact check : did @entity6 say he wants ' daylight ' between @entity23 , @entity170 ? fact check : @entity0 's comparison of past , present @entity173 pointless fact check : has @entity6 ' not signed one new free - trade agreement ' ?			1
