-- trick - or - treating and dressing in costume have been @entity4 traditions for a good long time now , but it seems we 're still struggling to get it right			1
we pass judgment on the ghouls and goblins at our front steps			0
we bang on the doors of darkened houses			0
we show up to parties in offensive costumes			2
so here are a few @entity16 , six not - so - gentle reminders of how to keep in the holiday spirit alive and sugared up			1
read them , memorize them , share them and have your happiest @entity4 yet			1
give goodies to any child who shows up at the door @entity4 night is not the time to quibble over the quality of trick - or - treaters ' costumes or whether some kids are too old to ask for free candy			1
and do n't even bother questioning whether they 're from your neighborhood , as if visitors do n't deserve your snickers			2
last week , a letter to @entity39 's @entity38 columnist , @entity37 , said the majority of trick - or - treaters in the advice seeker 's wealthy neighborhood appeared to be from poorer areas			1
" it just bugs me , because we already pay more than enough taxes toward actual social services , " the letter writer said			0
" @entity4 be a neighborhood activity , or is it legitimately a free - for - all in which people hunt down the best candy grounds for their kids ? " the rules on this are pretty obvious , as @entity37 pointed out : " stop being callous and miserly and go to @entity59 , you cheapskate , and get enough candy to fill the bags of the kids who come one day a year to marvel at how the 1 % live			1
" too cool for a costume ? do n't go to a costume party			2
you do n't have to like @entity4			1
you do n't have to welcome trick - or - treaters			1
you do n't have to pretend to enjoy parties where the main courses are caramel apples and candy corn			2
( more for us ! ) but if you decide to attend your pal 's costume party , at least put a modicum of effort into it			0
showing up in your work clothes and saying , " i 'm an underappreciated _ _ _ _ _ _ ( accountant , server , journalist etc. ) , " just is n't clever			2
if you truly ca n't be bothered and ca n't wait till plainclothes parties return next weekend , at least keep the snark to a minimum			0
everyone is just trying to have a little fun			0
it 's a culture , not a costume no blackface , no whiteface , no religious symbols , no @entity94 garb ... shall we go on ? every year on @entity4 , an insensitive or ignorant few fail miserably in their attempts to be edgy or clever or funny			1
when celebrities do this , it spurs a relentless cycle of online rage , hole - digging defenses and public apologies			0
it 's not any prettier when it happens at your neighborhood @entity4 bash , your lighthearted college kegger or in your kids ' class party			1
in recent years , students at @entity115 even created a viral campaign to remind their classmates that poking fun at race or ethnicity is n't actually funny			0
still , it seems every year that a few miss ( or ignore ? ) the message			0
do n't be one of them			0
costumes do n't have to be sexy @entity4 can be the perfect time for adults to show off a little something saucy			1
if that 's your aim , go ahead			0
but do n't do it because it seems easy or like it 's the only option			0
after all , showing up as a barely clothed version of a not - even - kind - of - sexy thing is n't hot			1
it 's ... awkward and , at this point , not surprising -- all the supposedly sexy gerbils , crayons and @entity139 of @entity140 past beat you to it			0
is n't it october where you live , you weirdly " sexy " bottle of ketchup ? if you 're feeling like " sexy " costumes are the only thing available , check out the ideas at @entity152			1
it offers up costume plans the average adult partygoer can pull off with a stretch of @entity157 required			0
on this dark and stormy night , look for the light it 's a very simple bit of @entity4 communication , more powerful than all the trick - or - treating apps and maps out there : the porch light			1
if it 's on , feel free to knock at the door or ring the bell once , screech your best " @entity168 ! " ( or tell a joke , or whatever your local candy - grabbing custom may be ) and gratefully accept whatever treats you 're offered			0
if the light is off , move along			1
and needless to say , do n't egg the house			0
potential candy - givers should n't forget this rule , either			1
you do n't want to send packs of @entity179 and " @entity181 " princesses away empty - handed -- or end up eating your jumbo - size bag of @entity183 by yourself			1
or do you ? spooky decor expires on november 1 unless you 're committing to a haunted look all year long , there 's a clear expiration date on your @entity4 decorations : november 1			2
on years when @entity4 falls early in the week , you get a few extra days -- but only through the next weekend			2
) do n't be that neighbor trying to pass off your soggy faux cobwebs as holiday icicles			2
so , take a few minutes this weekend to compost your pumpkins and sweep up your spiders			0
you might even feel a little behind : store shelves are already buckling beneath the weight of plastic trees and inflatable snowmen .			0

every @entity4 , people ignore a few rules that will help keep the holiday happy
costumes do n't have to be sexy and should never be based on *stereotypes*
porch light on ? trick - or - treat ! @entity208 light off ? move along , kids
after october *31* , do n't leave moldy pumpkins on your porch for weeks
