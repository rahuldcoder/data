the horror stories seem to stack up every winter : students sliding and stomping through knee - deep snow on their walks to school , trapped inside school buses or nestling in for a surprise slumber party in the school gym			1
this week , schools across the @entity12 shut down in preparation for a " potentially historic " blizzard			1
some even tried to have some fun with it , including those at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			0
they posted a snow day announcement that parodied the " @entity24 " hit " @entity23			0
" still , closing school is a tough call , said school superintendents from across the country			1
the decision often requires hours of preparation and discussion among administrators , local officials , road crews and meteorologists			0
most school leaders said they take a better - safe - than - sorry approach , but it can be hard to do as the number of days off climbs			1
" we lose a lot of sleep over it , " said @entity40 , superintendent of @entity42 schools in @entity43			1
so why would n't schools call off classes when weather seems like it could be dangerous ? here are a few reasons			1
with every winter storm threat , superintendents wake in the wee hours to consider the latest weather maps or drive their local roads			0
one february day last year , @entity59 , @entity60 , schools superintendent @entity57 was on a forecasting conference call at 4:15 a.m. within 30 minutes , and with the help of the schools ' facilities manager , she decided to cancel classes for the sixth time that year			1
but the choice is n't always that easy			0
after all , weather forecasts are n't guarantees			0
" there 's no snow yet at 4 o'clock , it 's forecast to come in , and you decide to cancel -- and then it does n't come , " @entity69 said			0
" we joke that no matter what we say , someone is going to disagree with it			0
" of course , there are worse ways to be wrong , she said : watching a snowstorm roll in once you 've brought children to school , calling buses back while kids shiver at their bus stops or sending young drivers out on dangerously slick roads			1
parents hate snow days , too			1
when the windchill hit 35 degrees below zero last year , the decision was easy for @entity40 : @entity18 was canceled			0
to his surprise , " i still received phone calls and e-mails from parents , " he said			1
" it 's a no - win situation			1
" as a father of young children , he can commiserate			0
he understands parents ' concerns about child care and time off from work			2
parents really hate it when he spoils vacation by adding makeup days to the end of the school year , he said			1
but his decisions are based on what 's safest for all students and staff members , he said			0
in january 2014 , many schools around @entity117 remained open for a few hours before snow began to fall			2
when they released early , some students ended up stuck on icy , gridlocked roads or stranded at school overnight			2
@entity124 schools -- a district just outside @entity117 with about 52,000 students and 6,200 faculty and staff -- closed before the snow arrived and initially heard some negative responses from parents , said @entity131 , the district 's director of communications			1
within a few hours , the tone changed			0
the superintendent 's office received more than 100 thank - you messages from parents and community members , she said , and a batch of handwritten letters from kindergartners who wrote , " you made the right decision " and " thank you for keeping my family safe			1
" " the e-mails we got in support were so gratifying and affirming , " @entity131 said			0
" sometimes , people are very quick to criticize and not as quick to praise			0
wild weather almost always means extra costs for schools , from storm cleanup to snow removal to staff overtime			2
but school closures can hurt the budget in deeper ways , especially if the days off begin to pile up			2
" we do have an obligation to the taxpayer that we are good stewards , financially , " @entity131 said			0
day - to - day school attendance wo n't typically affect a school 's finances , said @entity167 , former deputy executive director for programs and services for the @entity170			1
but it can lead to cuts if test scores sink , if students or teachers ' miss a chance to shine or if schools ca n't fulfill a grant obligation based on instructional time			1
" there 's a very competitive environment for grant money , foundation money , because of this economy , " @entity167 said			0
" it could jeopardize a potential funding source			0
educators know that school might be the only place where some students eat a healthy meal or experience a safe , supervised , warm environment			2
" you think about those kids , that this is the only wholesome meal those children get during the day , " said @entity167 , who was a middle school principal in @entity196 for 12 years			1
" when they miss that , what 's the result ? " but if the roads are n't safe , the power is out or a natural disaster has damaged the building , educators say , school is n't a safe place to be , either			2
closing school means less time to learn			1
it 's simple , educators said : if students are snowed out of school , they wo n't learn as much			2
educators said it 's especially tough on students gearing up for standardized tests or advanced placement exams and for new teachers who have n't mastered the art of the strong comeback			0
" what concerns us most is the lack of continuity in the kids ' education , " said @entity69 , the @entity60 superintendent			1
" there 's something about the energy of being in school every day that you miss. " a snow day here or there wo n't hurt student learning , said @entity238 , an assistant professor of public policy at @entity241 's @entity240			2
he recently studied eight years of school closures in @entity243 and found that snow days caused no harm			2
most teachers there understood how to adjust their lesson plans and prioritize must - learn material , he said			2
what did affect academic achievement , he found , were lousy weather days when schools remained open			1
on those days , higher numbers of students missed class , perhaps because of parental discretion or transportation issues , and entire classes suffered as teachers moved some students on and caught other students up			0
but in @entity243 , where snow days are no surprise , it was rare for schools to close for several days at a time , @entity238 said			2
the results might be different in states that rarely encounter extreme weather or for schools that face a major , one - time disruption			1
" the fact that snow days are not harmful is because schools and teachers know how to deal with them , " @entity238 said			0
not all learning is lost when school is out , though			0
educators across the country said they 're urging students to check out @entity282 and other online learning tools			0
some said teachers now assign homework in advance so students can stay on task			0
last year , some school districts experimented with virtual school days taught at home through school - provided laptops and tablets			1
@entity40 , the @entity42 , @entity43 , superintendent , said some in his district assign " blizzard bags " of schoolwork for students to dip into whenever they 're out of class , and it is considering online programs that would allow students to interact with teachers from home -- at least , between snowball fights and trips down the sledding hill			1
" the first couple ( snow days ) are ok , " @entity40 said			0
" when you get into five , six , enough is enough			0
i have a plea with @entity314 to ease up a little bit			1

school leaders say closing schools is a " no - win " situation
it can lead to angry parents , hungry kids and academic trouble
@entity43 superintendent : " i have a plea with @entity314 to ease up a little bit "
