@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 made a couple of stupid little jokes about @entity0			1
he uses our @entity0 as a symbol			1
everyone knows what @entity0 means			1
@entity10 wrote " @entity14 " for @entity11 years before @entity10 ever visited @entity12 and got everything right			0
vegas means ... wild , irresponsible , what - happens - here - stays - here			2
smoke cigars , have sex with strangers , get wasted and see stupid shows with stupid @entity22 doing stupid impressions of that stupid hillbilly			0
that 's an image we know and love in @entity0			1
it 's the image we spend our stupidly low tax money to promote			0
" @entity30 " was an official slogan			0
it 's the @entity0 image @entity32 has in her video , " @entity34 , " and @entity35 do a cameo in that video			1
we all promote that image			0
in @entity0 , our service industry services that nutty image			1
we make money off people thinking @entity0 is a place to get stupid and waste money			1
i know a joke when it bites me in the ass			0
and i 've done plenty of jokes biting other people 's asses			2
it seemed like @entity3 was off - prompter for his @entity0 bashing			1
his attacks were n't like @entity57 trashing @entity58 ( i lived in @entity58 when @entity57 was doing all the @entity59 trashing - maybe it 's me the presidents hate )			2
@entity57 and @entity61 meant it about @entity58			0
i know @entity3 does n't really hate @entity0			1
i bet he 'd have a blast here , if he were still welcome			0
@entity3 's good - natured symbolic joke was an applause line			1
people knew what he meant and agreed			2
yeah , do n't waste money on @entity0 , send the children to college ! the last time @entity3 made a negative comment about @entity0 , some jumpy , patriotic , image - conscious corporations canceled some trips here			1
that 's what we figure here in @entity0			1
there 's no way to really know if many people really canceled			2
do people really go to the president for travel advice ? but in @entity0 , most of us make our money from tourism or serving others who make their money from tourism			1
tourism is what we really , really do in the @entity1			2
it 's not like @entity3 is giving the @entity95 subsidies for not growing soybeans			1
it 's too easy to not grow soybeans in the stinking desert ; we do it for free			0
not farming is one of our vegan gifts to the rest of the country			0
we do n't know how much , but when the president of the @entity108 makes his jokes about @entity0 -- he costs real people real money			1
@entity3 knows that no one cares if @entity113 has less money			1
@entity3 is pretty happy to say that the rich ( and , man , am i rich			1
i do n't have even 10 percent of the money @entity3 has , but i 'm rich by my hometown standards ) should have more money taken from them			1
who cares about a magician losing money ? not even me			0
my children will go to college if they want			0
but , when people cancel trips to @entity0 , i 'm not the one who gets laid off			1
a few less people go to the @entity130 , and we still do fine , but the hotels lay off other people			0
it 's the people downstream of me who get punished for the president 's joke			1
we all know what @entity3 thinks is so laughable about @entity0			1
we know why we 're a symbol of wasteful stupidity			0
we 're a city built on gambling			2
it 's gambling no matter how much @entity144 calls it " gaming			0
" things have changed over the past 10 years			0
the shows and the restaurants are no longer loss leaders , we make real money on things other than gaming			0
there 's a wonderful , normal suburban community here , but the symbol is still gambling			0
we have gambling with money , but we also symbolize all sorts of other real - life gambling			0
after your fiance dumps you , maybe you 'll fly to @entity0 with the boys and someone who happens in @entity0 will stay with you the rest of your life			2
maybe you 'll really get lucky			0
@entity167 and i moved to @entity0 to do our own show in our own theater			2
we took a big chance			0
@entity0 also stands for stupid gambling like that			2
vegas is gambling in the broad sense , the idea that taking a wild chance on an unknown might turn out to be a good thing			0
what 's the main thing that drives stupid gambling ? hope			0
i 'm not sure how i feel about hope			0
i do n't gamble in the casinos			2
that kind of regimented hope seems less fun to me			0
i like to say i do n't believe in hope , but i had the hope to move to @entity0 to do a magic show			1
and i do hope that @entity0 pulls through this bad economic time and people come and visit us and we do our stupid shows for all the stupid , hopeful people			1
@entity3 , please remember , it was those stupid , very hopeful people who took the over on a stupid point spread on @entity3 with a stupid hope to help our country , which includes stupid vegas			1
the gamble @entity3 took with his run for president and the gamble that the @entity108 people took on him sure were n't taken at good odds			1
it was n't putting everything we had on red in roulette , or " do n't pass " in craps , or carefully counting cards in blackjack			0
@entity3 's presidency is more than all of us putting our whole future on 00 in roulette			2
it was more like putting everything we had on one slot pull at the stupid @entity11 impersonator slot machine in the stupid @entity11 casino for the stupid hillbillies who are filled with hope			0
maybe the @entity0 jokes in the @entity231 should stay in the @entity231			2
shortly after @entity3 's comments , he sent a letter to senate majority leader @entity235 of @entity1 , saying , " i was n't saying anything negative about @entity0 ... there is no place better to have fun than @entity0 , one of our country 's great destinations			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity113 .			2

president @entity3 said you do n't " blow cash " on vegas when you 're *saving* for college
@entity113 says comment wo n't go over well in town built on tourism
he says people who gamble on @entity0 also gambled on @entity3
