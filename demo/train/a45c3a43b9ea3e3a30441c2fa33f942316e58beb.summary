-- a lone saxophonist plays in the shadow of an overpass while a horde of cyclists looks down at a set of tangled train tracks			1
this outwardly gloomy spot is as good a place as any to begin a cycling tour of the " @entity11 , " a 160 - kilometer ( 99 - mile ) path developed to commemorate and transform one of the darkest chapters of the city 's past			1
once a popular location for defectors because @entity19 trains cut through a corner of the @entity24 zone , it was here on november 9 , 1989 , that tens of thousands of people overwhelmed an official checkpoint after a bureaucratic error led to the opening of the border			2
divided by mapmakers into 14 sections that vary from seven to 21 miles in length , the @entity11 , or " @entity31 , " traces the entire path of the @entity36			1
built in 1961 , the @entity36 divided the city by surrounding @entity38 , for decades following the partitioning of @entity19 after @entity40 an island of freedom behind the @entity43			1
' culture , politics and nature ' the @entity11 is a unique combination of tourist attraction and recreational zone , says @entity50 , the @entity51 politician and cycling enthusiast who conceived the plan in the early 1990s and is now working on a @entity55 - spanning @entity54 , inspired by the @entity36 route 's success			1
" it 's a ride through history , culture , politics and nature , " he says			2
that feeling hits home as i pedal across the @entity65 to the @entity36 memorial on @entity67 , where a watchtower and a section of the barren " death strip " have been preserved unchanged			2
while @entity50 's scheme might seem an obvious venture now , it was n't easy in the beginning			2
berliners hated the @entity36 so much that many people wanted every trace of it obliterated			0
in 1989 and 1990 , souvenir hunters were carting it away so fast that the government had to shift from demolition to conservation practically overnight			0
with experts forecasting an unprecedented population boom , real estate developers were eying the former " death strip " as keenly as @entity19 's notorious @entity88 security agents ever had			0
" at that time , all the politicians and the media said , ' no , no , we want to erase the @entity36 , ' " @entity50 says			0
" but 10 years later , in 2000 , we were successful			0
" completed in 2009 at a cost of some 10 million euros ( $ 13.4 million ) , today the trail appeals to all types of cyclists			1
bike - friendly public transport every section is accessible by @entity38 's bike - friendly public transportation system , so cyclists can pick and choose from various sights and terrain			1
it 's flat and paved , so it does n't take an athlete 's fitness to hack it , and an ordinary city bike or single - gear , hipster 's " fixie " serves as well as something fancier			1
better still , even though it attracts thousands of visitors every year , it never gets crowded , says @entity113 , who heads a tour company called @entity38 - on - bike			1
" as you experience the @entity36 zig - zagging through the city , you get a feeling for the separation , " @entity113 says			2
" in a lot of places , the difference between @entity19 and @entity38 is still quite vivid			0
" for tourists new to @entity38 , about 25 miles of the trail runs through the heart of the city			1
passing not only the @entity67 documentation center but also the @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and many other important historical sites , it makes an excellent route for a leisurely four - hour guided tour			2
meanwhile , for more committed cyclists , in former western districts such as @entity137 and @entity138 , the path doubles as a nature trail , cutting through forests			1
regular rows of plantation pines make the former death strip easy to identify			0
at 29 different sites along the path , memorial placards tell the stories of some of the nearly 250 " victims of the @entity36 , " such as @entity151 , a 19 - year - old cadet in @entity19 's @entity152 who was shot trying to escape to @entity38 in 1962			0
signposts at regular intervals make it well nigh impossible to get lost , and every section has something to spark the traveler 's interest -- the bridge where captured spies were exchanged , a former watchtower now used by the forest brigade or the famous @entity164 whose walls once formed part of the fortifications			0
riders are never more than a mile or two from the nearest beer garden			2
how to ride the wall for do - it - yourselfers , bicycle rental runs about € 10 per day , with outlets ubiquitous throughout the city			1
visit @entity38 offers free pamphlets with complete maps of the 14 sections of the trail and brief descriptions -- though only the @entity19 version was available when i visited			1
the same material is available online			0
@entity50 's " @entity184 : @entity188 " can be picked up for about $ 10 online or at the souvenir shop at the @entity187 on @entity67			1
@entity38 on @entity190 's " @entity189 " covers 15 kilometers of the @entity11 in about four hours			0
the company 's @entity192 - and @entity19 - speaking guides provide information about the building and destruction of the @entity36 and life in @entity19			0
at € 14 plus € 5 for bicycle rental , it 's worth considering even for those planning to do the rest of trail solo			1
an award - winning journalist and travel writer , @entity204 's byline has appeared in the @entity208 and the @entity209			0
he 's also the @entity38 correspondent for @entity210			0
@entity0 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0
