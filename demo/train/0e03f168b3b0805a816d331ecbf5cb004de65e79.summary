-- people living in the @entity2 are voting in a referendum on their political status on sunday and monday at a time of heightened tensions between @entity7 and @entity8 over their sovereignty			1
the two countries went to war over the territory , known to the @entity7 as @entity2 , in 1982 after the then - military government in @entity7 landed troops on the islands			1
according to the @entity2 legislative assembly , the vote is intended to affirm islanders ' desire to remain a self - governing territory of the @entity8 and to reject claims of ownership by @entity7			1
the question put to voters is : " do you wish the @entity2 to retain their current political status as an @entity27 of the @entity8 ? " the two - day referendum is supported by the @entity8 government			1
but the @entity30 in @entity31 said in a statement friday that the referendum had no legitimacy , characterizing it as " a further attempt by the @entity8 to manipulate the question of the @entity2			2
" because the area around the @entity2 is the subject of a sovereignty dispute , it argues , " the @entity8 has no right to alter the legal status of these territories , not even under the guise of a hypothetical ' referendum			1
' " @entity7 's president condemns ' colonial rule ' in january , @entity7 president @entity48 wrote an open letter , published in the @entity8 press , in which she called on @entity8 to hand back the islands and accused it of blatant colonialism			1
" the @entity7 on the @entity2 were expelled by the @entity53 and the @entity8 subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule , " she wrote			1
" since then , @entity8 , the colonial power , has refused to return the territories to the @entity7 , thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity			2
" she cited a 1965 @entity63 resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the @entity8 to abide by the resolution			0
the @entity8 government rejected @entity70 's call for negotiations , saying the @entity2 residents have chosen to be @entity8 and " have a right to self - determination as enshrined in the @entity75			1
" the january statement added : " there are three parties to this debate , not just two as @entity7 likes to pretend			0
the islanders ca n't just be written out of history			0
" as such , there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the @entity2 unless and until such time as the islanders so wish			2
" the @entity8 government accuses @entity88 of trying to " coerce " the @entity2 residents into becoming part of @entity7 through intimidation of those involved in fishing and oil exploration , and efforts to isolate the remote islands even further by limiting access by sea			1
long desired for its natural resources located in the @entity102 , about 480 kilometers ( 298 miles ) east of the tip of @entity101 , the @entity2 have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources , including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry			2
the islands , which raise their own taxes but rely on the @entity8 for defense and foreign policy , are one of 14 @entity113 and have been under @entity8 rule since 1833			2
more than 2,500 people from more than 60 nations live and work there , according to the islands ' government website , as well as forces stationed at the @entity8 military 's @entity120			2
many @entity2 residents are of @entity8 origin			1
@entity124 broke out over the territory in 1982 , when the then - @entity7 military government landed troops on the islands			1
@entity7 put its death toll from the conflict at around 645			0
@entity8 's civil and military losses amounted to 255			0
on its official website , the @entity2 government rejects as false the @entity7 government claim that a civilian population was expelled by @entity8 in 1833 and argues for the inhabitants ' right to choose their path			1
" the people expelled were an illegal @entity7 military garrison , who had arrived three months earlier , " it says			0
" the civilian population in the @entity2 , who had sought permission from @entity8 to live there , were invited to stay			2
all but two of them , with their partners , did so			0
" we are not an implanted population			0
our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly two hundred years			0
... we are no more an implanted population than are the various populations of @entity101 whose ancestors arrived as immigrants from @entity157 -- we arrived here as part of the same process and pattern of migration			0
" the islands are economically self - sufficient , the government says , except for the cost of defense needed as a result of " the claim made by an aggressive neighbour			0
" " the @entity2 are a peaceful , hard - working and resilient people			0
our society is thriving and forward - looking			0
all we ask is to be left in peace to choose our own future , and responsibly develop our home for our children and generations to come , " the government says			0
