a dusty , well - worn navy van pulls into the driveway of a grey , discrete home on a residential street			0
a woman opens the metal doors of the garage , but the van does not pull in			0
instead , a boy about 12 years old gets out and begins to unload plastic buckets , duffel bags , sacks of potatoes , foam mattresses , blankets and other household items , piling them up neatly in the corner			0
" we arrived in @entity20 less than a week ago , " @entity18 , 35 , says			1
she pulls out a crisp piece of white paper with her name and details scribbled in @entity25 and a red - ink stamp of the @entity20 cedar : a national symbol of strength , resilience and permanence			1
her hazel eyes swell with tears			0
" in @entity34 , we used to have a big house — three bedrooms , " @entity18 says			1
" we had land and i used to plant olive trees			0
now , this ( garage ) is our home			0
" she left @entity34 with her husband , 46 , and her children , ages 12 , 11 , 9 , 3 and 1			1
their home destroyed and her husband without work , they borrowed what money they could from friends and family and headed for @entity20			1
as the war around them intensified , they fled feeling as if they had no other option ; it was a matter of survival			0
" we left our village with the clothes on our back at 4 a.m. in the rain , " @entity18 says			0
@entity18 and her family are among the thousands of @entity34 who arrive in @entity20 each day , their lives torn apart by war and with few resources to start anew in @entity20			1
they arrive with what they could carry and with little , if any , financial cushion to support themselves as they try to create some semblance of normalcy in @entity20			2
the refugee crisis in @entity34 may not be as overt as other emergencies like the @entity82 earthquake , where the displaced clustered together by the tens of thousands in what were called " tent cities , " but the fact is more than 1 million @entity34 refugees are living in @entity20 and make up nearly 30 % of its population			1
to put this into context , it would be as if the @entity93 ' population grew by 100 million in the course of just 2½ years , with more than 50 % of them arriving in 2013			2
in the absence of large , formal tented settlements , which are prohibited by the @entity20 government , the vast majority of @entity34 refugees are forced to settle wherever they can find shelter			1
according to @entity102 , only 1 % of @entity34 refugees are living in rent - free unused buildings like schools , known as collective shelters			1
that means the remaining hundreds of thousands of @entity34 refugees in @entity20 are forced to rent what land or shelter they can find			1
some rent open patches of land to build small shelters that are a patchwork of scraps of plastic , cardboard , canvas and wood			0
others find shelter in unused buildings such as schools and mosques , which they often share with other refugee families			0
however , many , like @entity18 and her family , opt to rent the cheapest accommodation they can find : a garage			2
drive through any street in @entity132 , the poorest and northernmost district of @entity20 , and you will see clusters of people outside what used to be garages			2
because they were built to house cars , not people , they often do not have plumbing , running water or electricity			0
however , with more than 1 million @entity34 refugees living in @entity20 , the demand for shelter sent rental prices for garages soaring , often to around $ 200 a month			1
with few jobs available and what savings they had quickly evaporating , many @entity34 refugees find it extremely difficult to make their monthly rent payments			1
@entity155 , 43 , a father of three , who lives in an informal tented settlement with 14 other families beside a concrete factory just south of @entity159 , the capital of @entity132 district , says that he and his family are constantly making sacrifices to make ends meet			0
" we have n't had meat or chicken in five months , " @entity155 says , standing in front of his one - room , wood - frame shelter perched on a piece of concrete			0
the few square meters of land cost @entity155 and his family 50,000 @entity20 lire , about $ 30 , a month			2
while @entity34 refugees like @entity155 were able to escape to @entity20 with tens or hundreds of dollars in savings , the money will be gone soon and they will almost certainly be pushed over the edge into poverty , with few remaining assets , and no prospects for income			1
@entity155 's family and hundreds of thousands of others like them , once solidly in the middle third of the @entity185 , could easily tumble into the bottom third			0
the future of @entity34 's next generation hangs in the balance			2
@entity192 : how to help @entity34 refugees with the war showing no sign of abating and one - third of @entity34 's housing destroyed , there is little hope that @entity200 , @entity18 , @entity155 and the hundreds of thousands of refugees like them in @entity20 will be able to return home any time soon			1
that leaves them with no other choice but to find a way to survive as refugees in @entity20			1
rather than planning for the future , refugee families like @entity18 's have to figure out how to put food on the table , stay warm during the winter , get their children into school — all while what lives they built , what homes they owned , what money they saved were obliterated in the war			0
with thousands more @entity34 arriving every day , more rent - free shelter options have to be created — and quickly			2
@entity220 , with support from @entity222 , is focusing on getting what unused buildings they can find into habitable condition so that more refugees can live in safe , rent - free accommodations with safe drinking water , electricity and plumbing			2
@entity220 is converting five former farm buildings into multifamily buildings complete with latrines , shared cooking areas and utilities			0
once complete , they will house some 805 @entity34 refugees			1
while the new collective centers will open up a new shelter option for hundreds of @entity34 families in @entity132 district , they just scratch the surface of the wider need			2
without more shelter options , hundreds of thousands of @entity34 refugees will fall through the cracks the moment they arrive , slipping into obscurity behind metal garage doors			1
@entity18 supervises her son 's unpacking and looks around at the four concrete walls that make up her new home			0
" i just want to register my children in school , feed them and somehow transform this garage into a home			0

@entity20 government estimates more than 1 million @entity34 refugees are living in @entity20
large , formal camps for refugees are prohibited by the @entity20 government
most @entity34 refugees in @entity20 are renting some form of accommodation
