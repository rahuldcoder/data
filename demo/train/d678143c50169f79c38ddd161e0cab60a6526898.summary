@entity0 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 held talks with a string of @entity7 officials in @entity0 on wednesday but appeared to gain little traction on the sensitive issue of the competing maritime claims of @entity7 and its neighbors in the region			1
after receiving a hostile welcome in editorials and articles in the @entity7 news media when she arrived tuesday , @entity13 also had to contend with the abrupt cancellation of her planned meeting with vice president @entity22 , who is expected to become the next @entity7 president			1
@entity0 attributed the decision to unspecified scheduling reasons			2
@entity7 talks tough in @entity27 island dispute after meeting with @entity7 foreign minister @entity28 on wednesday , @entity13 repeated the @entity3 position on the territorial disputes between @entity7 and other countries in the @entity32 , urging those involved to " begin to engage in a diplomatic process toward the shared goal of a code of conduct			1
" tensions over territorial disputes have spiked this year between @entity7 and a string of countries around its coastline -- from @entity44 in the south to @entity27 in the northeast -- and the @entity3 has been drawn into the fray			1
but @entity0 , which prefers to tackle the disputes bilaterally , has reacted angrily to @entity50 's involvement in the matter , accusing the @entity52 of " unfounded accusations " and showing a " total disregard of facts			1
" at the joint news conference with @entity13 on wednesday , @entity28 took a more diplomatic tack , saying that " freedom of navigation and safety in the @entity32 is assured			2
" but even while @entity13 was in @entity0 , the @entity7 government was maintaining a heated diplomatic back - and - forth on another territorial controversy , this one concerning a set of small islands in the @entity64 also claimed by @entity27 and @entity65			1
the uninhabited islands are known in @entity27 as @entity67 and in @entity7 as @entity67 , and are privately owned by a @entity27 family			2
interactive : @entity71 's disputed islands - who claims what ? some @entity27 media outlets reported wednesday that the @entity27 government had agreed to buy the islands from the family , a claim the government 's chief cabinet secretary , @entity75 , declined to confirm , saying talks on the matter were continuing			1
but that was enough to prompt a stern response from @entity85 , a @entity86 spokesman			0
" i want to emphasize again that any unilateral actions taken by the @entity27 regarding the @entity67 are illegal and invalid , " he said			0
" we are closely monitoring the developments and will take necessary measures to defend our territorial sovereignty , " @entity85 added			0
furious @entity94 protests erupted across @entity7 last month when a @entity27 group sailed to one of the disputed islets and symbolically waved @entity27 flags			2
and @entity7 does n't seem eager for the @entity3 to get involved in the quarrel			1
the @entity100 , a @entity7 newspaper affiliated with the ruling @entity101 , said in an editorial published tuesday that @entity13 's diplomacy in the region " has fomented frictions between @entity7 and some surrounding countries			1
" it called on her to " reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the @entity7 - @entity3 relationship			2
" more : islands dispute reopens old wounds in reality , @entity13 is pressing @entity7 on hot - button issues like the territorial disputes , human rights and trade			1
but at the same time , she is seeking @entity7 's cooperation on such diplomatic headaches as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			2
both the @entity7 and the @entity3 camps sought to play down the cancellation of @entity13 's meeting with vice president @entity22 on wednesday , saying he had also called off meetings with other foreign officials			1
@entity7 officials said @entity22 would send a letter to @entity13			1
instead of @entity22 , @entity13 met vice premier @entity132 , who is widely expected to take over from @entity133 as premier at the end of the leadership transition early next year			0
a meeting with @entity22 or @entity132 is significant -- at least symbolically -- because they are widely expected to succeed the current leaders at a once - a - decade leadership change later this year			0
in the coming years , @entity3 - @entity7 relations are expected to remain contentious			0
as the @entity3 shifts more of its focus back to the @entity143 , @entity0 suspects that the @entity50 is trying to contain @entity7 's rise as a global power			1
@entity13 has tried to reassure @entity7 about the matter			1
" both president @entity148 and i have said frequently that the @entity3 welcomes the rise of a strong , prosperous and peaceful @entity7 , " she said wednesday			2
" we want @entity7 to succeed in delivering economic opportunity to its people , which will have a positive impact on the global economy			0
we want @entity7 to play a greater role in world affairs that strengthens global stability and helps solve urgent challenges			0
" the territorial disputes over islands in the @entity32 complicate that role			1
countries like @entity44 and the @entity162 lay claim to some areas of the sea , a 1.3 million - square - mile patch of the @entity167 dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls			0
but @entity7 has declared " indisputable sovereignty " over large swaths of the area , which is rich in marine life			0
the stakes are raised further by estimates that potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil lie underneath the seabed			0
the potential for conflict was demonstrated in april when a @entity183 vessel confronted @entity7 fishing boats in a remote rocky outcrop claimed by both countries			0
opinion : why @entity71 is arguing over its islands the resulting naval standoff between the two countries lasted for more than three months and aroused fears of an open conflict before the @entity162 withdrew its ships in june , citing stormy weather			0
the issue of who the lagoon belongs to remains unresolved			0
analysts have expressed pessimism that the disputes in the @entity32 will be defused soon			0
" while the likelihood of major conflict remains low , all of the trends are in the wrong direction , and prospects of resolution are diminishing , " the @entity201 said in a july report			0
@entity1 's @entity210 and @entity211 in @entity0 , and @entity212 in @entity213 contributed to this report .			2
