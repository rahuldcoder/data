@entity1 , @entity0 -- would you be offended if your boss got your name wrong ? maybe			2
would you want to leave your job ? maybe not			2
@entity8 boss sir @entity7 gave @entity9 the boot after a defeat to @entity12 in 2003			2
but if you 're already unhappy , like @entity14 , being called " insomnia " by a no - nonsense and unapologetic @entity16 was the last straw			2
the winger got his wish to leave @entity20 granted in the january transfer window by moving to @entity22 , prompting a war of words between the pair			2
" when you hear the manager say something like this about you , then you know he does n't respect you , " said the @entity26			2
" if he does n't respect you , what 's the point of playing for him ? @entity20 's veteran boss hit back at the 22 - year - old , who had refused to play for the club again under @entity16 , for " living in a fantasy land			1
" " there was not a day when he did n't have some @entity42 story about a club that wanted him , " @entity16 said			2
" first it was @entity12 , then @entity8 , then @entity44 , then @entity45 and @entity46			2
i think he needed bringing down to earth and i can assure you nobody tried to stop him going			2
" the @entity54 feud is the latest in a long line of players and managers falling out at club level			1
@entity59 picks out some of most memorable from the last 10 years			1
do you agree with our selection ? have your say in the @entity65 box			1
@entity66 vs @entity67 , 1999 @entity66 had been the @entity68 's leading scorer for @entity69 in 1998 and was still one of @entity72 's top marksmen when he had his falling - out with @entity44 boss @entity67			1
reports suggested @entity66 had been highly critical of @entity67 , particularly the @entity76 's transfer dealings at the @entity77			1
the club suspended him without pay			2
@entity66 conducted a strange clear - the - air - by - blaming - the - media press conference , throughout which he referred to himself in the third person			0
but he had signed his own death warrant at @entity44 and was sold to @entity12 in the summer of 1999			1
@entity84 vs @entity85 , 1999 more often than not , when a manager 's relationship with a player breaks down irreparably it 's the player who loses out			1
not when the club is @entity20 and the player is @entity84			0
@entity85 had arrived at @entity20 promising " sexy football " but his team were n't even able to flirt with good results			1
when @entity85 dropped @entity84 for the local derby with rivals @entity97 , it was considered a bold decision ; when @entity97 ended up winning the game , it was considered a stupid one			0
@entity84 , loved by the @entity101 fans , was going nowhere and made his feelings about the dreadlocked @entity104 coach clear			0
@entity85 was sacked shortly after , but still found time to criticize @entity84 , saying : " i told him to his face he was the most overrated player i have ever seen			0
" @entity107 vs sir @entity7 , 2001 @entity107 had proved himself to be one of @entity72 's top center - backs , with three @entity111 titles and a @entity112 in his three years at @entity8			1
but an ill - advised autobiography in the summer of 2001 , from which dressing room secrets and criticisms of the @entity117 brothers emerged , enraged @entity7			0
@entity107 might have been indispensable to the @entity119 faithful , but not the combustible @entity120 who promptly sold the @entity104 in the autumn to @entity122			0
@entity124 vs @entity125 , 2002 the seeds of @entity124 's 2002 exit from @entity128 were sown three years earlier in the infamous ' line - sniffing ' goal celebration , which left @entity125 irate			1
the @entity26 had already broken the club 's transfer record for @entity132 to partner @entity133 in attack , leaving fans ' favorite @entity124 as the odd one out			1
player and manager had already been at odds over team selection when @entity124 was left out of the squad for the start of the 2001 - 02 @entity111 season after kicking a ball at assistant manager @entity144 during training			0
@entity124 , becalmed by injuries but still a deadly finisher , eventually apologized but the damage was done and he was sold to @entity149 in november 2002			0
@entity9 vs sir @entity7 , 2003 @entity7 was concerned his protégé @entity9 was spending too much time indulging in the celebrity lifestyle flaunted by his high - profile wife , @entity152			0
the @entity0 captain 's @entity8 form had not dipped alarmingly but @entity7 still wielded the axe -- or , indeed , the boot			1
an argument between the two erupted in the @entity119 dressing room after a defeat to arch - foes @entity12 , and @entity9 took a boot in the face from a furious @entity7			0
the cut forehead healed but the rift did n't and the @entity0 captain left for @entity44 that summer			0
@entity166 vs @entity167 , 2006 @entity166 had already secured his move away from @entity169 by the time he had his spat with @entity167 , his former boss at @entity172			0
@entity166 's 2006 autobiography revealed how he believed @entity167 was jealous of his success and that the new @entity8 forward " would have gone anywhere to get away from him " -- including signing for @entity20			1
@entity167 took umbrage and then took @entity166 to court , winning a substantial payout from the @entity0 star			0
@entity182 vs @entity183 , 2007 when you 're one of the world 's most feared forwards and you 've just been signed for an eye - watering $ 45m , the expectation is you 'll score goals			1
@entity182 , though , turned 30 shortly after arriving at @entity190 -- but played as if he 'd just turned 40			0
@entity183 never wanted the @entity191 in the first place ( he 'd been bought by club owner and @entity182 's friend @entity194 ) , but after months of heavy - legged displays , the goal - shy striker saw fewer and fewer first - team minutes			1
@entity183 lost the power struggle with @entity194 when he was sacked in september 2007 , and @entity182 did n't last much longer at @entity200			0
@entity201 vs @entity202 , 2008 @entity202 has long been one of those @entity204 players you expect to be whisked away following a big - money offer			0
he is still there -- just			0
@entity202 's departure from the club looked assured when he was banned from training for two weeks and heavily fined after a launching into a dressing - room tirade at @entity201			1
a home draw to @entity214 led to @entity201 tearing into the @entity215 after the match and @entity202 responded with personal abuse			0
@entity202 has since returned to the @entity218 ' starting xi but @entity221 's player of the year and young player of the year for 2008 is drinking in the last - chance saloon at @entity224 .			1
