every five minutes a woman in @entity1 is compelled to visit a police station and report a case of cruelty -- usually one committed by her own husband or family			1
every ten minutes a woman in @entity1 reports assault			2
every 21 minutes one of them reports a rape			2
the numbers are no secret : you can do the math from the @entity17 yourself			0
the total number of these assorted cases has increased in each of the last five documented years , making for a 25 % jump over this period			0
but the numbers do n't tell the complete truth			0
at the very least , they are frequently misrepresented			0
with each high profile rape in @entity1 -- sensationally reported in national and sometimes international media -- the increased number of reported crimes is cited as an example of how the incidence rape in @entity1 is on a steep upward curve			1
but it 's a lazy correlation			0
in reality , we do n't really know that the number of cases of rape are on the rise			0
all we know is that more women are reporting these crimes -- perhaps , in part , because of the spotlight on them			0
either way , the number of women not reporting rapes and other crimes is a far bigger statistic -- many are undocumented , brushed under the carpet , forgotten			0
gender gap how do we explain why @entity1 has so many cases ? there are likely a number of complex sociological factors but there 's not much hard data			1
one useful indicator of the safety of @entity1 women is to look at how they compare globally on freedom			1
the @entity65 's new @entity64 gives @entity1 a dismal scorecard -- worse than in previous years			1
@entity1 's women rank 134th in the world ( out of 142 countries ) for economic opportunities ; they place 126th in the world for educational attainment ; 141st in the world for health and survival			1
these are all basic rights that would empower them , make them less likely to be silent victims			0
survey : women earn much less than men generally the only parameter @entity1 performs well on is on having a female head of state or government , where it ranks a surprising first			1
but the parameter itself is flawed			0
in 15 of the 21 years the study counts , @entity90 was prime minister			0
history will hardly portray @entity94 's achievements as solely a triumph for @entity1 women ; her victory and the length of her rule was also a triumph of her lineage ( @entity94 's father was @entity102 , @entity1 's first prime minister			1
she shared no relation to the legendary @entity94 , but her surname -- acquired through marriage -- did n't hurt			0
) a more reliable indicator of the political empowerment of @entity1 's women is how it places 111th in the world for electing female parliamentarians , and 107th in the world for voting in female ministers			1
born at a disadvantage why the sorry state of @entity1 's women ? why are they so far behind ? the sad reality is that it begins before women are even born			1
according to @entity1 's census , there are 940 women for every 1,000 men			1
in part , the difference exists because of decades of female infanticide -- the practice where families abort fetuses on discovering their sex			0
when girls are born , they 're born with the promise of a second class life			0
while men enjoy a literacy rate of 82 % , only 65 % of @entity1 women can read or write			1
girls in @entity1 have long been considered a burden , a cause for losing money in marriages and dowries			2
data and anecdotes alike show that @entity1 women have been unwanted and unloved for decades			1
consider how families pressure their daughters - in - law for baby boys , not girls			0
consider how in rural @entity1 , many @entity1 parents mistreat their daughters - in - law , demanding dowries , mothers - in - law meting out the same discrimination they were once subjected to			2
an overwhelming 43 % of crimes reported by @entity1 women are acts of cruelty committed by their own families			2
millions of @entity1 -- men and women -- are complicit			1
the discrimination continues at a policy level : marital rape is still not considered a crime in @entity1			2
local governments and police remain poorly equipped to process crimes against women -- let alone doing so in a sensitive manner			0
so why are many shocked by @entity1 's abysmal statistics on crimes against women ? the crimes , as always , begin at home			1
it should be no surprise to read about the physical crimes reported and recorded by the @entity17			0
what is surprising is how generations of @entity1 have stood by as their mothers , sisters , and daughters have been left behind on every indicator of quality of life ; they have been denied the chance for basic equality			2
the @entity65 report makes for illuminating reading , and signposts where @entity1 needs to go to fully realize the potential of its 600 million female inhabitants			1
opinion : where have @entity1 's females gone ?			2

@entity65 's new @entity64 gives @entity1 a dismal scorecard
134th out of 142 in the world for economic opportunities ; 126th for educational attainment
women are born at a disadvantage , enjoying far few opportunities than men
gender gap may help to explain poor treatment of women , *including* issues such as security , rape
