@entity0 -- @entity2 said monday that a special conference of its ruling @entity4 would take place next week , an event expected to solidify the authority of its new leader ahead of a controversial rocket launch			1
the meeting of party delegates , announced by state media , also comes just ahead of a significant anniversary for the secretive , nuclear - armed state -- the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity19 , the founder of @entity2			1
at the conference on april 11 , @entity19 's grandson , @entity20 , is likely to be named secretary - general of the @entity4 , a key post that would underline his status as " supreme leader " of the insular regime , said @entity27 , professor of political science at @entity29 in @entity30			1
that appointment would be " a very important signal that he 's consolidating power and positions from an institutional point of view , " @entity27 said			0
it would also mean that @entity20 would ex officio become chairman of the party 's central military committee , following in the footsteps of his father , @entity43 , who died in december			2
the expected conferring of the new titles on @entity20 is scheduled to happen just before the planned launch of a satellite by @entity48 between april 12 and 16 , using a long - range rocket			1
the announcement last month of the satellite launch -- which countries like the @entity53 and @entity54 see as a cover for a ballistic missile test -- ratcheted up tensions in the region and prompted @entity59 to suspend a recent deal to supply food aid to the @entity2			1
international leaders have urged @entity2 to cancel the launch , but @entity48 has refused to back down , insisting that the operation is for peaceful purposes			0
the last time @entity48 carried out what it described as a satellite launch , in april 2009 , the @entity66 condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated			2
part of the significance of this launch is its timing to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity19 , who ruled the communist state for more than four decades			0
his birthday on april 15 , known as the " @entity78 , " is a key public holiday in the @entity2 calendar			0
by holding the party conference a few days before that day , the regime is probably aiming to ensure that @entity20 holds the main titles in time for the big event , @entity27 said			1
he is already described by in official @entity2 discourse as the " supreme leader " of the party , state and army			0
@entity27 noted that it is still unclear how directly the young @entity19 , thought to be in his late 20s , in involved in policy decisions			0
so far , @entity20 , as the direct descendant of the country 's founder , appears to be " reigning , " while powerful senior officials in the regime like his uncle , @entity97 , seem to be doing the " ruling , " said @entity27 .			2

@entity2 says it will hold a ruling party conference on april 11
it comes ahead of a major anniversary and a planned satellite launch
the conference is seen as a way to consolidate @entity20 's leadership
