-- taking a cue from @entity3 , @entity1 will be rolling out " verified accounts " for its most popular users -- presumably hoping to encourage the @entity5 of the world to get active on the site			1
starting thursday , the site began testing a system that lets people with a large number of subscribers submit a government @entity14 to prove they really are who they say they are			1
" this update makes it even easier for subscribers to find and keep up with journalists , celebrities and other public figures they want to connect to , " a @entity1 spokesman said in an e-mail			1
once verified , a user will be able to " more prominently display an alternate name ( nickname , maiden name , byline , etc. ) on their timelines in addition to their real name			1
" unlike @entity3 , @entity1 has required users to register under their real names			2
so , now presumably @entity40 can be @entity40 on @entity1 , @entity39 can be @entity41 , and @entity42 can share photos of her @entity45 performance using just her first name			0
@entity3 , which lets folks create an account using any handle they want , has long had " verified " accounts for public figures to distinguish the real people and their tweets from the impersonators			2
while at one point users could request one , the site now makes its own decisions about who gets the coveted check - mark			0
the nickname issue has been a thorny one for social - networking sites like @entity1 that stake their brand ( and target their advertising ) based on people using their real identities			2
last month , @entity68 's upstart networking site , @entity67 , settled the issue with a compromise similar to @entity1 's -- allowing people to display a nickname or other pseudonym alongside their real name			1
in the early going , @entity67 had taken flak from early adopters , some of whom were booted for signing up with names that were not real			0
many of those people argued they were more widely known by nicknames on the @entity82			0
celebrities , sports stars , journalists and the like who have been verified by @entity1 will now get more prominent display on the site 's " people to subscribe to " list			1
@entity1 has been allowing subscriptions for about five months			0
they let users share information with anyone who chooses to subscribe to their feeds without having to actually become @entity1 friends with them .			0

@entity1 is rolling out " verified accounts " on thursday
system will let people with lots of subscribers apply to be verified
those people also will be allowed to prominently display stage names , nicknames
