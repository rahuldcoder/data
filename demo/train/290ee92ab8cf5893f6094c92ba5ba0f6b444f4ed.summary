-- imagine that a state creates a " ministry of truth " whose job it is to referee elections to make sure that candidates and activists did n't insinuate , exaggerate or otherwise spin their messaging			2
any political speech the truth - o - crats determined to be insufficiently candid would carry criminal penalties			1
sounds like a parable about the dangers of taking " clean elections " too far , right ? or a short story by @entity17 or @entity18 ? in the @entity20 tradition of political free - for - all , the idea that an omnipotent censor would vet stump speeches and ads against some government - designed truth - o - meter is a joke			1
unfortunately , this is no dystopia			0
by one count , about 20 states outlaw campaign distortions			0
most notoriously , @entity32 has a statute that prohibits making " false statements " about a candidate or ballot initiative			1
in one instance , former rep. @entity37 , @entity38 , used it against an anti-abortion group that had attacked him in the 2010 election			0
that 's the basis of a case now in front of the @entity20 @entity46			1
a hearing last week in the case began with the claim that " @entity37 voted for taxpayer - funded abortion			1
" that 's good fodder for dinner - party conversation or tv talking heads , but it was surreal in that it ended up before the highest court in the land			2
there 's no question that @entity37 voted for the bill at issue -- the @entity60 -- so the only dispute is whether statutory text actually provides federal funding for abortions ( a question of legal , economic and even theological interpretation )			0
alas , the @entity32 law extends even past matters of interpretation			2
its broad language also criminalizes rhetorical hyperbole			0
legally speaking , @entity32 's ban of lies and damn lies is inconsistent with the @entity77			1
indeed , disparaging political statements -- whether true , mostly true , mostly untrue or wholly fantastic -- are cornerstones of @entity20 democracy			1
mocking and satire are as old as the republic			0
just ask @entity84 , " the son of a half - breed squaw , sired by a @entity88 mulatto father			0
" @entity84 's 1800 campaign against @entity90 would make a modern spin doctor blush -- and that 's before @entity93 , noted pamphleteer and " scandalmonger , " alleged that @entity84 had fathered children with his slave @entity97 ( a charge largely confirmed nearly 200 years later )			0
in the fierce election of 1828 , supporters of @entity100 called @entity102 a " slave - trading , gambling , brawling murderer			0
" @entity107 partisans responded by accusing @entity90 of securing a prostitute for @entity109 later that century , @entity111 was asked at every campaign stop , " @entity113 , ma , where 's my pa ? " ( answer : gone to the @entity116 , ha ha ha ! ) more recently , we 've debated draft dodging , @entity120 and birth certificates , not to mention the assorted infidelities that are a political staple			2
any of these allegations could generate a complaint to the @entity126 and thus turn commonplace jibber - jabber into a protracted legal dispute			0
yet " truthiness " -- a " truth " asserted " from the gut " or because it " feels right " -- is a key part of political discourse			2
after all , where would we be without the knowledge that @entity136 are pinko - communist flag burners who want to tax churches and use the money to fund abortions so they can use the fetal stem cells to create pot - smoking lesbian @entity143 agents who will steal all the guns and invite the @entity146 to take over @entity20 ? would we be better off electing @entity158 , those assault - weapon - wielding maniacs who believe that @entity149 and @entity150 incorporated the nation after a @entity153 re-enactment and that the only thing wrong with the death penalty is that it is n't administered quickly enough to secular - humanist professors of chicano studies ? laws that criminalize " false " speech do n't replace smears and snark with " just the facts			1
" instead , they chill speech such that spin becomes silence			0
supporters of @entity32 's law believe that it somehow stops lies and insults , raising the level of discourse to that of an @entity175 debate ( which itself is n't that high , but that 's another story )			1
not only does this hope stand in the face of political history , it disregards the fact that , in politics , truths are felt as much as they 're known			0
when a red - meat @entity158 hears " @entity187 is a socialist , " or a bleeding - heart @entity188 hears , " @entity190 wants to throw granny off a cliff , " he feels a truth more than thinking one			2
no state agency can change this fact , and any attempt to do so stifles vital political speech			1
laws such as @entity32 's are so absurd as to be laughable -- except that criminalizing political speech is n't funny			1
the @entity46 should close the truth ministries once and for all			1
join us on @entity204 / @entity203 .			0

@entity206 says that political speech should not be regulated by states
the @entity20 @entity46 will rule on an @entity32 case that outlaws political lies
@entity206 : idea that a censor would vet speeches , ads against truth - o - meter is a joke
@entity32 's ban of lies and damn lies , he argues , is inconsistent with the @entity77
