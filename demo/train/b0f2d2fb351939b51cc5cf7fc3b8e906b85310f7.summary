-- @entity1 wears a niqab that covers her face , not for religious reasons but to hide what lies beneath			1
" she wears it to cover the deformity			2
she covers it because people would stare , children would cry , " says @entity8 , @entity9 's former foreign minister and first lady			1
" it 's not easy to look at			2
" @entity15 founded the region 's first maternity hospital , the @entity16			2
the facility is now a bustling general clinic providing care to all			2
for 11 years , she 's been seeking help to repair @entity25 's face , which was torn apart by shrapnel during the @entity27			1
@entity25 was just two years old when she was injured			1
she is now 25 and ca n't close her right eye			1
food falls from the hole in her cheek when she tries to eat			2
she 's long learned to deal with stares and awkward questions			1
" the hardest thing for her is when somebody asks what happened to her face , " @entity15 says , translating the softly spoken words from @entity25 , who 's seated beside her			1
" it just hurts me , " @entity25 says			0
they 're sitting at a press conference in @entity45 , @entity46 , a shiny modern city some 10,000 kilometers ( 6,000 miles ) -- and a world away -- from her home and her daughter in @entity51 , northwest @entity9 in the @entity52			1
her child , @entity53 , is just two years old , the same age as @entity25 when she was so horrifically injured			1
@entity55 and maxillofacial surgeon dr. @entity56 from the @entity57 is explaining the extent of the damage to her face and what 's going to be done to fix it by a team of experts , who are offering their services for free			1
" @entity66 is missing most of the tissue of her midface from the bottom part of the eye socket , the whole top jaw and most of the cheekbone and her palate , " @entity56 says			1
" the surgery will involve replacing , with a small synthetic implant , the rim of the eye socket			1
then the bulk of the missing tissue will be replaced by muscle that comes up under the cheekbone on the side of the head			0
" skin taken from her forearm will be moved to her face , and a plastic surgeon will also use cartilage from her ear to rebuild her nostril			1
extensive dental work will then be needed to reshape her smile			0
from behind her veil , @entity25 expresses her faith in the team of surgeons			0
" i 'm confident , i 'm not worried			0
" @entity15 adds , " she 's a brave woman			0
she 's had to live with this a long time ... she 's very relaxed			0
i 'm the one who 's falling apart			0
" she first heard of @entity25 's plight when the girl 's mother went to her hospital several years ago seeking help			2
then , the hospital in @entity107 , @entity9 had been open just one year and did n't have the expertise to deal with @entity25 's problems			2
@entity15 spread the word about @entity25 's injuries and a website was built			0
and , since it was uploaded to @entity118 in 2009 , a video about @entity25 's need for help has been viewed more than two million times			0
two years ago , a group of @entity121 in @entity46 met and vowed to bring @entity25 to the country for surgery			1
there 's no postal service in @entity9 so something as simple as sending a letter required outside help			0
and then there was the travel -- @entity25 had to travel hundreds of kilometers to the @entity133 capital @entity134 for scans , x-rays and assessments			0
just when the medical challenges seemed to have been resolved , the @entity46 government refused @entity25 's visa application			0
it was the second time a country had denied her approval to enter because her injuries were n't deemed to be life threatening			0
" since this is not a growing cancer or a heart condition or a situation that could kill her overnight , i guess some people would classify that as not life threatening , " @entity15 says			0
" but then when you 're a young women what 's more life threatening than not having a face ? " " the first visa denial was from the @entity159 , and that was hard			2
and then when the visa was denied a second time in @entity46 , we thought ' who will have the courage to tell this to @entity66 ? ' , " she says			1
" here 's a woman who 's only begging to have medical treatment which she 's not able to access anywhere else			0
i 'm glad that the decision was reversed , " she adds			0
since @entity25 arrived in @entity45 there have been a number of firsts			1
" she saw a river for the first time yesterday , " @entity15 says			0
" and walking up to this conference room she saw fish in a fish tank for the first time			0
" she rode an elevator for the first time ( and ) we had a few lessons to learn how to ride the escalator -- we had a few almost - trips but we 're here , " she laughs			2
@entity66 will undergo surgery on saturday			1
recovery will take weeks , if not months			0
when the scars have healed @entity66 hopes to be able to face the world for the first time with nothing to hide			1
" she says she 's looking forward to removing this , " @entity15 says , motioning toward the black niqab that cloaks @entity66 's features , " and to have a face like everyone else			1

@entity1 to undergo surgery in @entity45 to rebuild her face
she was *disfigured* at the age of two during the @entity27
@entity66 is now 25 and has endured years of stares , pain and shame
surgery in @entity45 is the result of an 11 - year plea for help from @entity8
