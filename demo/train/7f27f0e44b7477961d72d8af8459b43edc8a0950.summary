@entity0 cribbed a page from president @entity3 's playbook on thursday by taking a swipe at @entity6 's 2008 oped , " @entity7			1
" at an event outside @entity10 , where the former secretary of state endorsed democrats @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity8 spoke glowingly of their support for the 2008 auto bailout that invested billions into the @entity17 struggling auto industry			1
" now , they could take the safe way , they could line up with those saying ' let @entity10 go bankrupt , ' let manufacturing just wither away , " @entity8 said to a chorus of boos			1
" they could be on the side of those who were criticizing what they called government motors			0
" though @entity8 never mentioned @entity6 by name , the comment appeared to be directed at him , as well as @entity12 's and @entity13 ' @entity34 opponents			1
@entity6 unsuccessfully ran for president in 2012 and famously wrote on opinion - editorial for the @entity37 in 2008 that urged letting the big three auto companies -- @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 -- go into a structured bankruptcy			1
" if @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday , you can kiss the @entity17 automotive industry goodbye , " @entity6 wrote			1
" it wo n't go overnight , but its demise will be virtually guaranteed			0
" @entity8 voted in favor of the auto bailout when she returned to the @entity53 from her failed presidential campaign in 2008			1
@entity6 's editorial , though written years before , was a staple of the @entity3 attack against @entity6 in 2012			2
the campaign used the recovery of the auto industry to label the former @entity62 governor as out - of - touch			0
@entity3 would regularly say that he " refused to let @entity10 go bankrupt			2
" @entity8 's comments are particularly striking given the probability that she runs for president and the recent chatter that @entity6 will try to run for president for a third time			1
" we 'll see what happens , " @entity6 told @entity71 last month			0
his wife , @entity74 , told @entity75 earlier today that she is still " done " with the idea of another presidential bid , but adds " you know , you never do say never			0
" @entity8 used more of her speech to talk about the auto industry and the decision to approve a bailout			2
" they , " @entity8 said , referring to people who wanted the companies go into bankruptcy , " were willing to walk away from the people of this state , the jobs , the auto industry , the future			2
" later she added , " there are some choices that define career and define what people are made out of			0
there are choices that shape your whole life			0
this was a choice that would change the future of an industry , a state and a nation			0

@entity0 knocks those who wanted to " let @entity10 go bankrupt "
@entity8 *argued* the decision would have " let manufacturing just wither away "
@entity6 famously wrote an oped titled " let @entity10 go bankrupt " in 2008
the oped was used *effectively* against @entity6 during his failed 2012 presidential run
