-- it 's been days since three @entity3 presidents offered to give @entity4 a safe place to hide out from @entity7 authorities			1
but the man who 's admitted leaking classified documents about @entity7 surveillance programs remains holed up at @entity12 's @entity11			2
and the global guessing game over his next steps has n't stopped			0
it 's still unclear where @entity4 will go , and how he 'll get there			1
what 's the holdup ? out of @entity20 : @entity4 's options sure , we 've heard fiery speeches offering asylum from leftist leaders who are eager to criticize the @entity7			1
but supporting @entity4 's cause and wanting to make @entity27 look bad are n't the only parts of the equation , with so many trade and diplomatic relations hanging in the balance , said @entity33 , president of the @entity34 think tank in @entity36			1
" they want to make a point , " he said , " but i think they 're concerned about suffering the consequences , which i think would be serious			0
the @entity7 has made that pretty clear			0
" here 's a look at the pros and cons that leaders are facing in five @entity3 nations that are among the 27 countries where @entity4 is seeking asylum			1
@entity49 president @entity50 was the first leader to say he 'd give @entity4 asylum			1
officials have said they 're waiting to hear whether @entity4 accepts the offer			1
pros : @entity50 regularly alleges @entity7 imperialism , has accused the @entity7 government of trying to destabilize his country and even suggested that @entity7 officials may have infected late @entity49 leader @entity58 with the cancer that eventually killed him			2
taking in a high - profile fugitive wanted in the @entity7 would give him another platform to criticize the country			0
it 's been months since the death of @entity58 , who earned major political points at home and a place in the global spotlight with his fierce criticisms of @entity3 , including a notorious @entity72 speech where he called president @entity73 the devil			2
@entity50 describes himself as @entity58 's son			0
but while he might have the same speechwriters as his predecessor , he does n't have the same charisma , and it seems like fewer people are listening to his words			0
giving @entity4 asylum would be politically popular in @entity49 , shoring up support for @entity50 among @entity58 loyalists			1
it also has regional and global implications			0
" this for @entity50 , i think , really provides an opportunity for him to show himself on the world stage as a regional leader , as the true successor of @entity58 , " said @entity87 , a senior fellow at the @entity88			0
cons : relations with the @entity7 have been slowly thawing since @entity50 's election in april			0
last month , things were looking up when @entity7 secretary of state @entity98 met with @entity49 foreign minister @entity99			2
that would change if @entity49 granted asylum to @entity4			1
" this will clearly freeze the warming of relations with @entity49 , " @entity87 said			2
despite years of tense @entity49 - @entity7 relations , economic ties between the two countries remain strong			1
imports and exports between the @entity7 and @entity49 totaled more than $ 56 billion last year , according to the @entity110			2
@entity49 's state - run oil company makes tens of billions of dollars annually from exports to the @entity7			1
@entity49 is the @entity7 ' fourth - largest supplier of imported crude oil , according to the @entity115			2
would offering @entity4 asylum put that relationship in jeopardy ? it might			1
but this is n't the first time @entity49 has run afoul of the @entity7			2
@entity87 argues that in offering @entity4 asylum , @entity50 gains more than he loses			1
" surely there 's going to be legislators in the @entity124 who are going to want sanctions against @entity49 , but i do n't think it 's going to get very far , " @entity87 said			1
@entity33 says it 's unclear whether the benefits are worth the costs			0
@entity130 president @entity131 says he 's furious about what happened last week with his presidential jet , which had to land in @entity134 after @entity136 countries allegedly closed their airspace amid suspicions that @entity4 was aboard			1
now @entity139 says he 's willing to give @entity4 asylum as a " fair protest " of the incident			1
pros : @entity139 has long slammed what he calls @entity7 imperialism , kicking out the @entity146 , the @entity7 ambassador , and the @entity148			0
accepting @entity4 would fall in line with the @entity130 president 's argument that his country would be better off without any @entity7 interference			1
and in terms of its relationship with the @entity7 , @entity130 has little goodwill left to lose			1
the @entity7 ' trade ties with @entity130 are weaker than its links with other countries in the region			1
" @entity130 's a country that i think has the least real economic interest with the @entity7 , " @entity33 said			1
cons : still , there 's some economic connection			0
exports and imports between the @entity7 and @entity130 totaled more than $ 2.4 billion last year , according to the @entity110			2
despite @entity139 ' fierce criticism of @entity136 countries and the @entity7 after the plane incident , @entity33 said , it 's unclear whether he really wants @entity4 to come to @entity130			1
@entity172 president @entity173 says his country will grant asylum to @entity4 " if circumstances permit			1
" was that a way to sound supportive , but give himself a way out ? it 's unclear			2
pros : like @entity50 and @entity139 , @entity173 is a vocal critic of the @entity7 , and his allegations of @entity7 imperialism play well with his supporters			0
cons : business is big for @entity173 's government , and it 's about to get a lot bigger			0
@entity190 investors and @entity172 leaders have just signed a deal to build a $ 40 billion canal through the country			1
does that mean @entity172 is now looking @entity196 but not west when it comes to business ? quite the opposite , @entity33 said			2
" i think the canal project is another factor that makes them even more interested in staying on the good side of the @entity7 , " he said			0
exports and imports between the @entity7 and @entity172 totaled more than $ 3.8 billion last year , according to the @entity110			2
and @entity172 gets trade preferences from the @entity7			2
as concerns about @entity4 from business leaders mount , they wo n't fall on deaf ears with @entity173 , @entity33 said			1
" @entity173 has good relations with the business community in @entity172			2
he 's somebody that i think also has a pragmatic streak in him , " @entity33 said			0
" rhetorically , at times , he 's confrontational , but behind the scenes , he 's making deals			0
" @entity219 @entity4 set his sights on @entity219 with his first asylum request after leaving @entity222 on june 23			1
president @entity223 railed against the @entity7 in fiery speeches over the issue earlier this month			0
but the government has said it 's still weighing the request , but ca n't act until @entity4 's in @entity219 territory			1
some speculate that the delay in getting a clear response from @entity219 is what inspired @entity4 to apply for asylum in dozens more countries			1
pros : @entity219 granted asylum to @entity237 founder @entity236 last year , and has touted the decision as a clear sign that the @entity241 nation is a defender of human rights			0
giving @entity4 asylum would give officials another platform to make that case			1
defiant authorities in @entity219 said last month that they would n't bow to @entity7 pressure in @entity4 's case , vowing to reject trade benefits so @entity7 officials could n't manipulate them			1
cons : when @entity219 officials said they did n't need @entity7 trade preferences , business leaders issued a swift response : not so fast			0
and with about half of @entity219 's exports heading to the @entity7 and trade between the two nations totaling more than $ 16 billion last year , @entity223 probably will weigh their comments carefully , @entity33 said			0
" @entity223 is a guy who on the one hand , he 's very defiant of the @entity7 and wants to be the rhetorical leader of the left in @entity3 , " @entity33 said			0
" on the other hand , he 's got a very broad coalition in @entity219 and is trying to be more pragmatic and attract foreign investment			0
" after speaking with @entity7 vice president @entity271 last month , @entity223 adopted a more measured tone			0
" we have to act very carefully but with courage , " he said , " without contradicting our principles but with a lot of care , responsibility and respect , of course , towards the @entity7 but also respect for the truth			0
" @entity282 president @entity283 has n't shied away from talking about the @entity4 case			1
he 's hailed the former @entity287 contractor 's revelations and stressed that he supports fellow @entity3 countries ' right to grant @entity4 asylum			1
but there are two key things he has n't said : whether @entity282 will grant asylum to @entity4 and whether he 'd allow a plane carrying the @entity7 intelligence leaker to make a stopover in @entity282 on the way to @entity241			1
pros : decades of hostile relations between the @entity7 and @entity282 and a tough economic embargo could mean that @entity282 would have less to lose than other @entity3 nations when it comes to granting asylum			2
with so many sanctions in place , said @entity307 , president of the @entity308 in @entity36 , " i do n't know what more the @entity7 could add			0
" official media in @entity282 have painted @entity4 as a hero			2
@entity282 could decide to step in , @entity33 said , " if there 's an issue where it would have to do with @entity3 pride and dignity and sovereignty			0
" while granting @entity4 asylum might be a step too far , letting a connecting flight carrying him land in @entity282 might be an option			1
" i think there 's a measure of risk in that for @entity282 , but it may be ok if he does n't stay there , if they 're facilitating it as a transit stop , " @entity33 said			0
" but i think it would make them uneasy			0
" cons : there are signs that @entity36 's relationship with @entity335 is improving , such as a recent agreement to hold talks over bringing back direct mail between the two nations			0
and @entity282 is hopeful about more developments in @entity7 president @entity342 's second term			2
" i think that maybe @entity282 does not want to complicate this process and risk the advances that have been made recently , " @entity307 told @entity0 en @entity343			0
" i would guess that @entity282 does not have an interest in receiving this man , and does not want to complicate the relationship with @entity36			0
even though it is n't a very good relationship , it is a relationship that has gotten a little better in recent months			0
