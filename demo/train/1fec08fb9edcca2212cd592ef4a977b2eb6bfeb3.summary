that 's @entity2 's magic number on @entity3			1
if voter turnout stayed exactly as it did in 2008 ( impossible , i know , but hear me out ) then 11,000 - some new voters would push the @entity7 out of last place for voter participation			1
watch out @entity10 , @entity2 is coming for you			2
if 11,466 more people voted in the presidential election in @entity2 , then the state 's turnout rate would hit 50 % of the eligible population , based on numbers compiled by @entity19 's @entity18 on a site called the @entity21			1
that would push @entity2 past @entity10 , which had a 49.9 % turnout			1
that 's a lot of numbers , i know			2
and there are plenty of caveats , since turnout obviously wo n't be the same as it was , thanks to @entity31 and a host of other factors			2
but my takeaway is this : @entity2 is really close			2
that 's an attainable goal			2
for the past few weeks , i 've been working on a new @entity37 project called change the list that 's focused , at the moment , on boosting @entity2 's lowest - of - the - low voter turnout rate			1
it 's not that i do n't love @entity10 and the other 49 states , too , but i 'm also a sucker for an underdog story			2
when it comes to voting , @entity2 's story is just that			1
shortly after statehood in 1959 , more than 90 % of the state 's eligible voters cast ballots			1
in 2008 , with @entity2 's own @entity53 on the ticket , fewer than half of eligible people voted			1
when i traveled to the @entity7 to talk to nonvoters , i met people who did n't know the election was coming up in november , those who feel like their votes do n't matter because they 're so far ( in distance and psychology ) from " the mainland , " and those who do n't want to participate in a political system that values conflict over compromise			0
i ca n't help but think that our national politics -- bogged down in money and aggression -- could use a healthy dose of the @entity72			0
@entity2 's voice should finally be heard			1
here are a few reasons for optimism on this front : 1			0
@entity2 : this volunteer group , whose name means " to plant " in @entity7 , has been working this year to register new voters and engage communities that typically have been left out of the political conversation			1
as of last month , the group had registered 2,397 new voters and knocked on 789 doors asking people to vote			2
if all of those new registered voters actually go to the polls ( if that 's you , do it ! ) then the contest is already 20 % taken care of , thanks to the work of 40 @entity98 volunteers			2
close races and big issues : it 's a generally held belief in the world of voter - turnout - ology that competitive elections tend to drive up turnout			1
nationally , the presidential election could hardly be closer -- and the candidates are as different as @entity108 and @entity109			0
but it 's the local and state races that will really push people to the polls in @entity2			1
ask just about anyone on @entity116 what his or her top political issue is and they 'll likely say one word : " rail			0
" a commuter - rail project has become the divisive topic of the @entity127 mayor 's race , and both sides are quite polarized			2
a @entity130 poll shows the race is very much up for grabs , with @entity133 , the anti-rail candidate , leading @entity134 50 % to 45 %			0
" a lot of it is going to come down to turnout , " a pollster told the news site			0
the surf : before i left for @entity2 , a state representative , @entity142 , gave one very @entity2 - specific reason for the state 's low turnout : surf			1
when the surf 's up , he said , people wo n't go to the polls			0
the theory is a little wacky , of course , but even if it 's true , there will be better surf in @entity2 on monday than tuesday , @entity3 , said @entity155 , " chief surfing officer " of the @entity156			1
" most people only surf on average for an hour and a half to 2 1/2 hours , " he told me by phone			0
" that leaves plenty of time to go to the voting booth			0
" waves on monday are expected to crest at 15 feet			0
tuesday , they 'll still be big , but more in the 8 - foot range			0
by the way , @entity155 votes			0
the conversation : take this with a grain of salt , but it seems from where i 'm sitting ( far - far away , in @entity175 ) that lots of people in @entity2 are talking about voting this year			1
maybe it 's the people i chat with , like @entity180 , in @entity181 , who told me that her phone has been ringing off the hook ( she described this phenomenon as the phone having " diarrhea " ) since she was featured on @entity37 as one of six nonvoters in @entity2			1
and then there 's the news coverage			0
tv stations and newspapers in @entity2 have been talking about @entity2 's low level of voter participation in recent weeks			1
all of this chatter has to help raise awareness about an important election			0
on my trip , i learned that one reason people do n't vote is that they 've never been asked to participate			0
i hope the state of @entity2 feels a collective plea from those of us on the mainland to vote this year			1
of course , none of this is up to me			0
it 's up to people in @entity2 to go to the polls -- even if they never have before			1
if everyone in the state encouraged a few of their friends to vote , the list certainly would be changed			2
just look at what @entity98 has done with only 40 volunteers			0
if you want to help keep the conversation going , here are two small things you can do : share this " @entity223 for @entity227 " image on @entity225 or @entity226 and do the same with this " 11,466 " image			0
it 's a small thing , sure , but a reminder that this goal is in reach .			0

based on 2008 numbers , @entity2 needs 11,466 new voters to jump out of last place
the state had the lowest voter turnout in 2008 , making it the subject of a @entity37 series
@entity37 's @entity242 hopes to try to *increase* voter turnout in the *islands*
@entity246 : new get - out - the - vote efforts could lead to *increase*d participation
