-- fifty years ago this month , i chanced to hear the rev. @entity2 i was a mild - mannered kid with a speech impediment and a love of math. that day , i was focused on solving math problems , not issues of justice and equal rights			1
but @entity2 broke through to me when he said this : if the children of @entity14 march , @entity11 will see that what they are asking for is a better education			1
they will see that even the very young know the difference between right and wrong			1
i chose to march , and found myself among hundreds of children jailed for five terrifying days			1
mind you , i was not a brave child			2
but even at 12 years old , i believed and hoped that my participation could make a difference			2
twenty - five years later , i had made my way to the @entity24 , @entity25			1
my colleagues and i had an outrageous dream : perhaps a young research university -- just 20 years old -- could alter the course of minority performance in higher education , particularly in the sciences			1
@entity25 philanthropists @entity34 and @entity35 shared our vision			1
@entity38 : how to escape education 's death valley and now people ask : what magic have we hit upon that has enabled us to become a national model for educating students of all races in a wide range of disciplines ? how did we -- as a predominantly white university with a strong liberal arts curriculum -- become one of the top producers of minority scientists in the country ? rather than magic , there are a number of educational principles at work			1
and what my colleagues and i have found is that they all grow out of one key truth : the world does not always have to be as it is today			2
@entity38 : hey science teachers , make it fun to start , we faced up to some particularly tough questions : why were n't more students from traditionally underrepresented groups succeeding ? in what ways was the university responsible ? what questions were n't we even thinking to ask ? the lessons we learned took shape in the @entity76 , which has grown into a national model for producing minority students who earn advanced degrees in science , technology , engineering and math. @entity38 : our failing schools -- enough is enough in fact , a number of campuses across the nation have been replicating the program , including most recently the @entity90 and @entity91			1
along the way , we discovered that the strategies that helped minority students initially could be just as effective in helping students across racial and economic groups and across the disciplines -- throughout the arts , humanities and social sciences : work from strengths and set high expectations			1
too often , we focus on deficits			2
we see poor preparation or lack of family support , rather than seeing underdeveloped talent and tenacity			2
at @entity24 , we look at a student 's background as context , not as destiny			1
we set high expectations , and both challenge and support students to ensure their success			2
build a community of scholars			0
we help students develop strong peer networks and encourage them to see one another as partners , rather than competitors			0
it is effective -- and powerful -- when students support and hold one another accountable			0
engage students in meaningful research			0
when asked who contributed most to their academic success , students will almost always mention a faculty member			0
faculty - student connections are critical , and it 's especially important that faculty engage students in meaningful research			0
we like to say : it takes researchers to produce researchers			0
hold yourself to quantifiable progress			0
we constantly evaluate the outcomes of our work , and that evaluation is data - driven , not anecdotal			0
for example , we know that the various features of the @entity76 -- peer support groups , intensive advising , early research experiences -- work in combination			0
@entity24 's students graduate , and they go on in large numbers to earn @entity151 in science and engineering			1
but which elements of our approach are most critical and cost - effective ? we 're currently working on a project funded by the @entity157 to tease that out			0
if we do n't look critically at what works -- and what does not -- we ca n't recalibrate and continue to improve			0
a graduate recently wrote me to share a quote from @entity165 : " we are what we repeatedly do ; excellence , then , is not an act , but a habit			0
" to fuel that kind of persistence , hold fast to this one key truth : the world does not always have to be as it is today			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1

@entity176 , *longtime* college *president* , started with an " outrageous dream "
*inspired* by memories of @entity2 , he sought to teach people of all backgrounds
@entity24 , @entity25 has been recognized for training minority scientists
