a black man is returning to the @entity1			1
four years ago , it was a first , the breaking of a racial barrier			0
tuesday night , it was history redux			0
in the midst of national splintering and a time of deep ideological animosity , @entity6 elected president @entity10 to a second term			1
and thousands rejoiced in his victory , one that seemed sweeter and , perhaps , more significant			0
" this is affirmation that his color does n't matter and that his message resonated with people , " said @entity16 sociologist @entity15 , author of " @entity10 's @entity17 and the @entity18			1
" " it is very important in that it will indicate that an @entity26 can be viewed for what he says and not what he is			0
" victorious @entity10 faces familiar challenges had @entity10 lost the election , he would likely have been remembered in history as the first black president , and maybe little else , @entity15 said			1
now , he has a chance to create a legacy rooted not in his identity , but in his ideas			1
" if this country wants president @entity10 to have another term , i 'm ready to say that it 's a significant moment , " he said			1
as an @entity26 , @entity39 understood the power of 2008			0
but his excitement was measured			0
he knew the nation was tired then of two costly wars in @entity49 and @entity50 , a sinking economy and an administration that he felt excluded ordinary people			0
he thought @entity55 sen. @entity54 was a weak candidate and that the cards were stacked in @entity10 's favor			1
four years later , @entity10 traversed a much tougher road , @entity39 said			1
@entity6 had a strong alternative in the @entity61 challenger , former @entity62 gov. @entity60			0
the nation , he felt , was no longer in a desperate state and voters had more of a choice			2
despite that , they elected a black man			1
" they sent a message to the world that whatever racist proclivities might exist are not enough to preclude @entity10 from winning , " @entity39 said			1
" we can not deny that this is new social space we occupy in this country			0
" a changing @entity6 , @entity39 believes , will be very much a part of @entity10 's national conversation in a second term			1
that includes a stronger stance on race relations , an issue some believe @entity10 had to distance himself from in his first term for political expediency			1
for that , he drew criticism from african - americans with high expectations of a black president			1
" can you imagine knowing you 're the first black president and you have to win the @entity91 to win a second term ? " he said			1
" it 's such a thin thread that holds together his ability to win as a black candidate			1
" the constraints are not going to be there in his second term			2
he 's going to have much more swagger			2
" in playwright and @entity105 radio show host @entity103 's estimation , @entity10 's re-election feels more historic than his first because of what she views as a tide of callousness toward people of color			1
she criticized measures like the new voter id laws in several states , which she said obstruct participation and " desecrated " @entity6 democracy			0
she said re-electing @entity10 represented a denunciation of those measures and the @entity61 presidential candidate who supported them			2
" it 's really important to recognize that this was not just a choice to put someone back into the @entity1 , " @entity124 said , " but a choice to reject a man who demonstrated callousness			1
" " i have exhaled			0
i am breathing , " she said			0
@entity6 demand more from @entity10 's second term @entity10 's victory , said @entity133 contributor @entity131 , was possible because of the support of a coalition of people who reflect @entity6 's demographics			1
" nobody believed four years ago that you could have black folks and lesbians and gays and @entity143 and young folk standing together to move the country forward , " said @entity131 , a former special adviser to @entity10			1
but @entity10 was demonized , he said , and turned into a cartoon character			2
african - americans asked if someone like @entity10 is not acceptable , then who is ? " there is vindication here , " @entity131 said			2
" this is a backlash against the backlash			0
you saw african - americans stepping up , @entity143 stepping up , young people stepping up ... saying we 're better than we 've been seeing on the attacks on this president			2
" opinion : five things @entity10 must do the challenge for @entity10 in the next four years , however , will no longer be racial in nature , @entity15 said			2
it is certain to be ideological			0
@entity10 wo n't ever have to run for office again , but he will have to make his case for policies , @entity15 said			2
" his goal has been to be a post-polarization candidate , and he naively believed he could do that as a president , " he said			0
" he did n't want to be a highly partisan figure			0
as a result , he could n't control the political debate			0
he 's going to have to keep campaigning and not become a policy wonk			0
" @entity10 seemed to recognize that in his victory speech early wednesday in @entity179 , the city where he first fostered hopes and launched dreams			2
he told the roaring crowd , made up of that previously improbable coalition , that he planned to sit down with @entity60 in the weeks ahead to chart a new course for the country			0
opinion : @entity10 will get little time to celebrate " we believe in a tolerant @entity6 , open to the dreams of an immigrant 's daughter who pledges to our flag , to the young boy on the south side of @entity179 who sees a life beyond the street corner , to the furniture worker 's child in @entity201 who wants to become a doctor or a diplomat or even a president , " @entity10 said			1
" we will rise and fall as one nation , and as one people			0
it does n't matter if you are black or white , young or old , rich or poor			0
you can make it in @entity6 , if you 're willing to try			0
" it was a reflection of his own journey , of a man who 'd made it as a two - term black president .			1

in the midst of national splintering , voters returned a black man to the @entity1
sociologists say this is affirmation that @entity10 's ideas mattered more than his identity
he will have a chance now to leave a legacy beyond being the first black president
he will take a stronger stance on race issues in his second term , some say
