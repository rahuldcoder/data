-- the peculiar standoff on @entity2 between @entity4 security forces and a group of men from the southern @entity7 has its roots in a recent landmark peace deal between @entity10 and @entity12 rebels , according to an expert on the region			1
more than 100 men from the mainly @entity12 southern @entity7 came ashore in the @entity4 state of @entity17 on @entity2 early last week demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that has historical claims on the area			1
their claims touch on an unresolved territorial question between the @entity7 and @entity4 , as well as @entity10 's efforts to improve relations with @entity27 insurgents in the country 's south after decades of violence			1
@entity4 police and armed forces soon surrounded the village in the eastern @entity17 district of @entity35 where the men had gathered			2
police officials said they were negotiating with the group in an effort to persuade its members to return to their homes in the @entity7 peacefully			2
the @entity7 government also urged them to come back to the country , saying it had n't authorized their voyage			2
there was no indication of a resolution to the standoff on monday			0
the men claim to be the @entity51 of the @entity52 , which once encompassed @entity17 , and say they do n't want their people to be sent away from the area , @entity4 authorities said			1
there are conflicting claims about to what extent the men are armed			0
eroded power over the weekend , comments appeared in the news media from representatives of the sultanate , whose power is now largely symbolic , saying that their followers who had gone to @entity17 planned to stay where they were			0
" nobody will be sent to the @entity7			0
@entity17 is our home , " @entity67 , a member of the sultanate 's ruling family , told reporters in @entity10 on sunday , according to @entity71			0
the sultanate 's claim to @entity17 plays a long - standing and important role in the @entity7 government 's relationship with the country 's @entity12 minority and with neighboring @entity4 , said @entity80 , the dean of the @entity81 at the @entity82			1
established in the 15th century , the @entity52 of @entity52 became an @entity27 power center in @entity84 that at one point ruled @entity17			0
but the encroachment of @entity88 colonial powers , followed by the emergence of the @entity7 and @entity4 as independent nation states , steadily eroded the sultanate 's power , according to @entity80			1
it became " a sultanate without a kingdom " to rule over , he said			0
@entity52 is now a province within the @entity7			0
but the sultanate has nonetheless retained influence over some people in the southern @entity7 and @entity17 who still identify themselves with it , according to @entity80			1
excluded from a peace deal the members of the sultanate 's royal family , although riven by internal disputes over who the rightful sultan is today , appear to have felt isolated by the provisional accord signed in october by the @entity7 government and the @entity110 , which has fought for decades to establish an independent @entity27 state in southern @entity7			1
@entity4 , a mainly @entity12 country , helped facilitate the agreement			0
@entity67 was cited by @entity71 as saying that the sultanate 's exclusion from the deal , which aims to set up a new autonomous region to be administered by @entity12 , prompted the decision to send the men to @entity17 this month			0
dispatching the boat loads of followers to @entity35 served to make the sultanate 's presence felt , according to @entity80			2
" the whole aim is not to create conflict or initiate war , it is just to position themselves and make governments like @entity4 and the @entity7 recognize them , " he said			1
historical ties the economic , cultural and historical links between @entity17 and the nearby @entity7 islands , as well as the porous nature of the border between the two , means that many of the @entity7 men have friends and relatives in @entity35			0
but the historical connection still fuels tensions between @entity4 and the @entity7 , with @entity10 retaining a " dormant claim " to @entity17 through the @entity52 , according to the @entity143			1
according to the official @entity145 , @entity10 still claims much of the eastern part of @entity17 , which was leased to the @entity147 in 1878 by the sultanate of @entity52			0
in 1963 , @entity149 transferred @entity17 to @entity4 , a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal			1
@entity4 still pays a token rent to the sultanate for the lease of @entity17 , according to @entity80 .			2

more than 100 @entity7 arrived by boat on the @entity4 coast last week
they say they represent a sultanate that once ruled the area
the move seems to be a *response* to a recent peace deal in the @entity7
the *leaders* of the sultanate appear to have felt left out of the accord , an expert says
