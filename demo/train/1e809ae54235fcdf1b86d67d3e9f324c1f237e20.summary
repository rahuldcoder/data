@entity0 , @entity1 -- five years after @entity3 struck , @entity4 is disappointed and disillusioned with the lack of progress made in @entity0			1
" nothing 's really changed , " said the 35 - year - old @entity0 native			1
he says some spots are still " in shambles " in 2010 , and that many residents still feeling helpless and without support , like they 're " floating in the wind			2
" @entity4 , known as " @entity14 " by his close friends and family , fled to @entity17 , @entity18 , with his then - pregnant wife shortly before the storm hit			1
but , he was n't able to ride out the storm in peace for long			0
after @entity3 hit , he received a frantic , barely audible phone call from his mother			1
she and @entity4 's father had stayed put despite warnings			1
the floodwaters were rising and they were in dire need of help , and fast			0
attempts to get assistance for his parents were futile			2
the @entity35 , the @entity36 and the @entity37 were among the officials who told @entity4 they could n't reach the area where his mother and father were trapped			1
shocked and upset with the those responses , @entity4 knows there was no question about his next move			1
he immediately went back to save his parents from the flooding caused by the failed levees			2
" people were down here suffering , " @entity4 said			1
" somebody dropped the ball			0
... since the storm , i have lost faith in all levels of government			0
" the insurance companies have n't been helpful , either , @entity4 said			1
his deductible is $ 7,500 , which he would n't be able to afford should another such weather - based tragedy occur			0
@entity4 made the eight - hour trek back to the ravaged city			1
about a mile from his parents ' house , tents were set up and people had gathered there			2
@entity4 paid a man with a boat $ 50 to take him to his parents ' neighborhood , where he blew an air horn and looked for survivors			1
@entity4 -- who did n't know how to swim -- found his parents , who were then taken to safety along with their neighbors			1
@entity4 's parents were among the few people in their neighborhood who rebuilt their house , despite the damage done by @entity3			1
however , in a cruel twist of fate , a 2007 tornado destroyed their home again			0
not wanting to fall victim to a weather disaster for a third time , they moved to a different neighborhood , but still close , and certainly within the state of @entity1			0
seeing his beloved city in ruins @entity92 was devastating for @entity4			1
eighty percent of the city was underwater			0
streets once exploding with life -- loud music and laughing -- were drowned			0
there were many bleak moments			0
there were times when it seemed there was no hope			0
he says the crime , carjackings and political corruption the area experienced afterward hindered attempts for a much - needed renaissance			0
some spots , such as @entity112 , rebounded quickly , thanks in large part to the tourism sector			2
@entity0 has 300 more restaurants than it did before @entity3 hit			1
other areas have yet to make even a partial recovery , especially the @entity120			0
@entity4 says that was one place that lacked basic necessities , like grocery stores that operated for an extended period of time			1
in the days following @entity3 , people stood in line for hours to get into the nearest @entity128 , where the shelves were quickly emptied			1
animals were left to die in abandoned houses			2
for many , a deep depression sunk in			0
for some , it has yet to fade			0
" there was nothing to come back to -- nowhere to go -- it was horrible , " says @entity4 , who made a self - described " emotional " return visit to the neighborhood of @entity136 , where he grew up , and where he documented the devastation with before - and - after pictures for @entity2 's " @entity140 " project			1
in some instances , the changes seen in these pictures over a five - year span are minimal			0
seeing areas that have n't been fixed since 2005 is tough for @entity4 to accept			2
@entity148 : @entity4 revisits @entity136 many homes are still abandoned and boarded up			1
old water marks , some reaching halfway up buildings , are still visible , as are spray - painted marks that indicated bodies , odor or pets inside			0
overgrown yards and the obvious blight make it tough to forget all the damage			0
" everybody was poor after the storm , " @entity4 said			2
he says the still - rough conditions are why many evacuees have never returned to their neighborhoods			2
many moved out of state to places like @entity168 , @entity169 ; @entity170 , @entity171 ; @entity172 , @entity18			0
it 's tough for @entity4 to walk down the familiar , once - vital streets now deserted			1
" there 's whole blocks with no cars , no one out and about ... nothing			2
it 's boarded up , that 's the aftermath of @entity3			1
just have to deal with it			0
" but almost immediately after @entity3 , @entity4 and his family were itching to get back to the @entity0 they love			1
they were n't thrilled with their temporary time in @entity18 , saying there was a lack of action and excitement in the air			0
there were none of the parades , explosive brass band shows or nights spent drinking and laughing with friends regaling stories after a full day at work			0
it did n't take long for the @entity4 family to pack up their belongings and get back to the city streets they knew and loved			2
despite the past , and the lack of improvements in some sections of @entity0 , @entity4 is still thinking optimistically , and keeping his fingers crossed			1
he 's hoping brighter days are in the city 's future , and is more than ready for the day when people in @entity0 are no longer treading water , but are able to swim deeply in @entity0 's legendary greatness			1
" i love the city , the culture			0
... that 's all i know			2
i ca n't survive anywhere else			0
