-- dramatic satellite images show large deposits of sediment in coastal @entity4 , the receiving end of the massive flooding on the @entity7			1
the sediment gush has a down and up side in region known for its seafood and delicate wetlands , a federal official said friday			1
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) and @entity16 recently provided the stark imagery of the sediment plumes to the @entity19 and @entity4 to assist them with flood response			1
see flooding map from @entity15 a map on the @entity15 website allows users to call up the plumes and see flood data collected by government agencies			2
the opening of the @entity29 caused a sediment plume in @entity31 above @entity32			2
another plume resulted from the opening of the @entity35 and flooding on the @entity37			2
the third is where the @entity7 meets the @entity40			1
" we live in historic times , " said @entity41 , director of the @entity15 's @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity4			1
the tan and brown plumes resulted from millions of gallons of sediment - laden freshwater rushing to the @entity40 through spillways , river channels and levees			2
wetland seasonal flooding " is essential to the health of coastal wetland ecosystems , " according to the @entity15			2
extreme flooding that has occurred this year has delivered high amounts of sediment and nutrients			1
the sediment will hurt the oyster harvest in the brackish waters of @entity31 , essentially a bay , @entity41 told @entity0			0
" all of this is temporary , " he said			0
" eventually , @entity31 will cleanse itself			0
" flooding in the @entity37 basin has not been as severe as expected after officials opened the @entity35 , but @entity41 acknowledged it has affected residents			1
across @entity4 , officials are still coping with the crisis			1
the @entity4 governor 's @entity71 and @entity73 said thursday that at least 1,230 structures in 13 parishes have been affected by floodwaters			1
friday , it said 1,150 @entity78 continue to be mobilized for the flooding response			0
for the @entity37 wetlands , the flooding is a plus because it will create desperately needed land , @entity41 said			1
@entity84 hopes for busy @entity85 " if the marsh grasses could sing , they would be singing praises , " the official said			0
the sediment pushing through the mouth of the @entity7 is good for flood control , @entity41 said , " but it 's not a good thing for the ecosystem			1
" officials are undergoing the laborious of measuring and analyzing the sediment			1
ecologists lament the sediment reaching the gulf , rather than building wetlands , which protect @entity102 from storm surge and support aquatic life			2
over the past 80 years , the state has lost coastal wetlands equaling the size of @entity109 , federal officials say			1
" it 's a national tragedy , " @entity41 said			0
" the wetlands are needed			0
" the problem is not new			0
natural processes and human disturbance , including dredging and pollutants , have taken their toll			0
@entity41 on june 2 will present at the state @entity118 a map of @entity4 wetland losses and gains from 1932 - 2010			1
he hopes the new map will help inform land managers and agencies on marsh restoration			0
federal authorities , meanwhile , are in the process of closing portions of the @entity35 as the swollen @entity7 recedes			2
the spillway was opened may 14 to prevent the @entity7 from flooding @entity32 and @entity131			1
the @entity19 has closed five of 12 bays , public affairs specialist @entity132 told @entity0 on friday afternoon			0
the @entity19 said much as 1.2 million gallons ( 172,000 cubic feet ) per second had been pouring through the spillway , which diverted water through the @entity136 , but that number was down to 120,000 cubic feet per second later in the week			0
the high water has caused some flooding down the @entity37			0
but the water levels " continue to be lower than anticipated " throughout the basin , corps spokesman @entity140 said this week			0
the river remained about five feet above flood stage friday afternoon at @entity145 and about six feet over flood stage at @entity147 , on the approaches to the @entity40			0
but it was more than five feet lower at the town of @entity151 and about two feet below flood stage at @entity153 , about 20 miles south of the spillway .			0
