-- authorities want to take dna samples from " @entity3 " @entity3 in connection with their investigation into the 1982 incident in which seven people died after taking @entity9 capsules laced with potassium cyanide , according to the @entity12 office in @entity13			1
" as part of the re-examination of the 1982 @entity9 poisonings , the @entity12 attempted to secure @entity18 from numerous individuals , including @entity3 , " said @entity14 , @entity12 spokeswoman			1
" to date , @entity3 has declined to voluntarily provide samples			1
" however , in a handwritten motion filed in federal court aimed at stopping the online auction of possessions taken from his @entity26 cabin in 1996 , @entity3 writes that he did agree -- with a condition -- to provide the sample			1
@entity31 's motion @entity3 , 68 , killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of bombings from 1978 to 1995			2
the @entity12 dubbed him the " @entity3 " because of his early targets -- universities and airlines			1
he was arrested in 1996 , pleaded guilty in 1998 and is now serving a life term in the federal " supermax " prison in @entity41 , @entity42			0
@entity43 would not comment on whether federal authorities already have a dna sample from @entity3 or when the request for his dna was made			1
" it would have been standard procedure for @entity18 to be taken from @entity3 as an inmate in a federal prison , " said @entity47 , a spokeswoman for the federal @entity48			2
but she could not say precisely when @entity3 's dna was taken in the past , and had no information on the @entity12 's request for a new sample			1
" the standards on dna testing have changed over the years , so forensic examiners would want a fresh sample , " said @entity13 @entity12 spokesman @entity57			1
he said he did not know whether the original sample was kept or not			0
@entity63 , a spokesman for the " @entity65 " prison , would not comment on the @entity18 issue , saying it was " not a matter of public record			0
" on april 27 , @entity3 writes in the motion filed may 9 , prison officials told him that " the @entity13 office of the @entity12 wanted a sample of my dna to compare with some partial dna profiles connected with a 1982 event in which someone put potassium cyanide in @entity9			1
the officers said the @entity12 was prepared to get a court order to compel me to provide the dna sample , but wanted to know whether i would provide the sample voluntarily			1
" @entity3 said he asked for time to think about it , and said he later sent a written response to prison officials saying he would provide the sample voluntarily " if the @entity12 would satisfy a certain condition that is not relevant here			1
" @entity57 said he had no knowledge of what @entity3 's condition might be			2
" i have never even possessed any potassium cyanide , " @entity3 said			2
" but even on the assumption that the @entity12 is entirely honest ( an assumption i 'm unwilling to make ) , partial dna profiles can throw suspicion on persons who are entirely innocent			2
for example , such profiles can show that 5 % , or 3 % , or 1 % of @entity99 have the same partial profile as the person who committed a certain crime			0
" if it happens by chance that i fit one of the partial @entity18 profiles that the @entity12 has in relation to the 1982 cyanide incident , then it will be not only to my advantage , but to the advantage of society in general , to resolve correctly the question of any putative connection between me and the cyanide incident			1
for this purpose , some of the evidence seized from my cabin in 1996 may turn out to be important , " and the auction should not go forward , he writes			0
a similar motion was also filed in district court , according to court documents			0
" @entity3 has not been indicted in connection with the @entity9 investigation , and no such federal prosecution is currently planned , " federal prosecutors said in a response to the motion			1
" consequently , there is no basis for an order interfering with the sale previously approved by the district court , as directed by the court of appeals			0
" absent a judge 's ruling on the motion , the auction launched as planned wednesday			0
bidding for a handwritten copy of @entity3 's 35,000 - word manifesto , which ultimately led to his capture , stood at more than $ 12,000 as of thursday			2
in 1982 , seven people in the @entity13 area died after taking @entity145 capsules laced with potassium cyanide			1
the deaths prompted a national scare as several drug chains pulled @entity9 off their shelves and people in several cities were hospitalized on suspicion of cyanide poisoning			1
in an october 1982 article , @entity154 quoted dr. @entity156 , then director of the @entity157 in @entity158 , as saying , " if it was going to be a lethal dose , you would n't have time to call			0
" @entity164 , parent company of the @entity166 drug maker , was widely credited for its aggressiveness in recalling the product and its transparency in dealing with the deaths , and the product quickly bounced back in sales , remaining a popular analgesic			0
the incident led to changes in the way over-the - counter drugs were packaged , as tamper - proof seals were instituted			0
the case was never solved			0
in february 2009 , the @entity12 announced it was working with @entity182 state and local police to review evidence related to the killings			2
" the review was prompted , in part , by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity			0
further , given the many recent advances in forensic technology , it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence			2
" @entity9 spokesman @entity195 declined comment on the @entity3 matter thursday			1
about 60 items are featured in the online auction of @entity3 's possessions , including clothing , books , photographs and documents			2
proceeds from the sale will benefit four of his victims who sought restitution and were awarded $ 15 million			0
@entity3 vehemently opposed the auction and fought a court battle to prevent it			0
the auction runs through june 2 at gsaauctions.gov			0
@entity0 's @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
