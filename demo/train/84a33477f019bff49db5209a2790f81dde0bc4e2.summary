i just attended a @entity2 prescreening of the @entity3 : the @entity4			1
" it was presented by @entity3 and @entity6 , attended by @entity3 executives and a select audience of @entity2 professionals			1
in the audience was @entity10 , an 85 - year - old woman married to a marvelous gentleman -- a survivor of the death camps of @entity15 other stories come to mind as i recall the night 's events , but i want to share one short exchange with you , my loyal readers			1
@entity10 enjoyed the film and mentioned her favorite part : in the film someone asks me : " who do you like ? " further questions included : " are you gay ? do you like women ? " i simply answered what was in my heart : " i like people			1
" the person asking the question was trying to force me into a label of " straight " or " gay " or " lesbian " -- or who knows what			2
@entity10 , with her years of experience and wisdom , was struck by my simple answer			0
she came up to me after the movie and asked me to go into detail			0
i spoke about my life of discovery , finding myself and finding others who have open minds and yearn for rational thought beyond mere passages from ancient books or bigotry of stereotypes and such			0
i 'm learning to look beyond the many " labels " that we 're forced to abide by in society			0
@entity10 said , why ca n't we do that for everything ? ok			1
now it was my turn to be awestruck by a simple answer			0
i gave her a hug and said , " thank you			0
i now understand what i 'm really doing and see what you see in me			0
" you all who are reading this might ask , " what the heck are you talking about ? " putting my answer simply , two things : i like people -- no labels -- just people			1
and , why ca n't we do that for everything ? opinion : lift ban on transgender military members here 's what i mean : look beyond the label of gender , race , color , religion , age , sexual orientation -- or anything			1
why ca n't we just like each other for just being ourselves in all of our diversity as humans ? what is wrong with us that we constantly label and judge each other ? this inhibits everyone 's potential as humans			1
i 'm so tired of labels , and it seems that everything in life and society reinforces those labels			0
look around and see how many things point us into a label and divide us as people into those labels			2
the fashion magazines , the media , the news , our parents , our brothers and sisters , our friends , our neighbors , the church , the mosque , the guy on the corner who never met me is enforcing labels and controlling my thoughts and actions according to those labels			0
this is my question to the world : when can we all just live our lives as we are and not live the label ? when can we just be ourselves and support each other in our own happiness and freedom ? i want to see fewer stereotypes in the media , less " @entity136 " and " @entity135 , " and more of us regular folk who are just as beautiful as people need to be -- maybe more beautiful -- if you look beyond the label			2
i want to just like every human and enjoy our diversity in all things			2
when i grow up i want to be like @entity10 -- she is really cool .			2
