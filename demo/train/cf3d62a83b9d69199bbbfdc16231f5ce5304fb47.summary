@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 president @entity3 on friday signed a broad agreement of cooperation with the @entity7 , the same deal whose reversal set off a crisis in the nation			1
the signing came hours before the president 's office announced a three - day extension of a cease - fire			1
this is the latest step suggesting @entity4 may be moving back from the brink of full - fledged civil war -- though the situation remains volatile , with continued violence and the constant fear of yet more , cease - fire or not			1
this tension has recent roots in then - president @entity28 's decision to shun the @entity29 last year and work with @entity30 instead			1
that move unleashed deadly strife that led to @entity28 's ouster , the loss of @entity35 and a @entity37 separatist rebellion			0
sealing the deal may be the second-most important moment in @entity4 's history , @entity3 said , after its independence from @entity30			1
he said the signing " shows how dramatically things can change in a short time , if the will of the people is strong enough			1
" and he paid tribute , on what he described as a " great day " in the nation 's history , to @entity4 who lost their lives when protests over closer ties with @entity54 turned bloody			2
" the document we will sign today is not just political and economic , it is a symbol of faith and unbreakable will , " he said			1
" it is a tribute to people who gave their lives and health to make this moment happen , and it is the strongest reminder that today 's @entity54 is and must be about people 's determination to live in a better and safer world			0
" @entity3 said that in signing the @entity29 , he was making a unilateral statement that his country has underlined its choice of future membership in the @entity7			1
and he signaled to @entity30 that its efforts to undermine the closer unification of @entity54 would fail in the face of @entity4 's determination to pursue its @entity54 dreams			1
he used the same pen intended for use in november before @entity28 turned his back on the agreement in favor of @entity79			0
@entity30 reaction @entity82 spokesman @entity81 said on @entity30 state tv that signing the @entity7 deal is a " sovereign right " but that " @entity30 will undertake its measure if its market is negatively affected " by the agreement			1
such action probably would be protective trade measures intended to shield @entity30 producers and industry from an influx of potentially cheaper , better - quality goods from @entity54			0
speaking at a @entity1 news conference after the signing , @entity3 said what was needed more than sanctions was a " real dialogue " with @entity30			2
the @entity7 and the @entity99 have repeatedly warned @entity79 that more economic sanctions could be imposed if it does n't act to defuse the crisis			2
" i really hope that finally now this dialogue will take place and we will have a real cease - fire and the implementation of my peace plan , " @entity3 said			1
speaking in @entity79 , @entity107 also emphasized the need for a lasting truce , according to @entity30 's state - run news agency @entity110			1
" @entity4 should embark on the path of peace , dialogue and accord			2
the priority is to conduct substantial talks between the authorities in @entity118 and the southeast , " @entity107 is quoted as saying			1
" we stand for the complete termination of bloodshed on the whole territory of @entity4 , including along our borders , " he said , adding that @entity30 is doing its best to contribute to the peace process			2
foreign minister @entity126 on friday called for @entity4 to carry out promised constitutional reforms and said @entity30 should be involved in consultations to safeguard the interests of @entity30 speakers in southeast @entity4			2
@entity132 leader sees stability , prosperity the @entity135 calls for a free trade zone and for @entity4 to adhere to @entity54 values such as democracy and human rights			2
it will allow for the country to participate in common border protection and security processes			0
in remarks before the signing , @entity132 president @entity144 also remembered those who died in @entity4			1
" in @entity118 and elsewhere , people gave their lives for this closer link to the @entity7 , " he said			2
" we will not forget this			0
" @entity144 said that closer political and economic ties would bring greater security , stability and prosperity to @entity4 and the two other former @entity157 states also each signing an @entity29 on friday , @entity158 and @entity159			2
" our joint goal is your full integration into the market of the @entity7 , " @entity144 told those countries ' three leaders , adding they must push forward with reforms			2
he also expressed the @entity7 's solidarity with the three nations in the face of @entity4 's " very difficult " security situation , and the " uncertainties " looming over @entity158 's and @entity159 's relationships with @entity30			1
he stressed that @entity30 had nothing to fear from those nations ' closer ties with @entity54 , adding the @entity7 would engage with @entity79 to work for peace			2
@entity107 -- pragmatic or emotional ? as @entity4 's government works to quell the violence in the east , @entity3 has said that negotiations with @entity30 separatists there will continue friday			1
peace is possible if @entity107 is in the right mood , he told @entity2 's @entity185 in an exclusive interview thursday			2
" sometimes , the position of mr. @entity107 is quite pragmatic , sometimes it is very emotional , " @entity3 said			1
" i just try to find out the time when he is more pragmatic than emotional			0
" the talks are intended to end fighting that threatens to escalate into a broader conflict			2
" i am optimistic and i 'm thinking that within a few weeks , maybe months , we can have a deal to establish peace , " @entity3 said			0
@entity107 has agreed to negotiations that will include an @entity7 representative , @entity3 said			1
" we do not expect any immediate negative reaction , " he said			0
" i 'm ready to make a peace deal with anybody			0
" he is also ready to fight if necessary but said , " i hate the idea not to use the last opportunity to bring the peace to the region			0
" peace plan under his peace plan , he seeks a commitment to negotiations , the release of hostages , a mutual cease - fire and the withdrawal of @entity30 - backed forces from @entity4			1
" all the troops on @entity4 territory are @entity30 , they are @entity30 citizens , " he alleged , adding that separatist leaders were from the @entity30 secret service			0
" if that continues , it is a real war			0
" @entity3 said that @entity4 had seen 18 soldiers killed and 33 injured in the past week , while the separatists had shown " no negotiation , no sign of compromise			1
" but he held out hope for last - minute negotiations friday and said he could not yet say whether the military action against the separatists would resume			0
at the same time , he made clear that in his mind , the @entity30 annexation of @entity35 -- which has an ethnic @entity30 majority -- can not stand			0
@entity35 is @entity4 , he said			0
he made the same point friday when he said that " all @entity4 , including @entity35 " will be associated with the @entity7			1
@entity30 and @entity4 have been engaged in a tense standoff since the annexation in march when @entity30 also massed troops along its western border with @entity4			0
cease - fire extended @entity3 's office announced friday a 72 - hour extension of a fragile cease - fire that was declared last week			1
that means that , by late monday night , the @entity118 government expects that all hostages will be released , all international border checkpoints will be taken out of separatists ' hands and the militants ' recruiting offices in @entity30 will close down			0
at the same time , the @entity4 government says it still reserves the right to use force in any areas where the cease - fire is not being universally accepted			1
in fact , there have been plenty of examples of violence since the original cease - fire was declared			1
on thursday , for instance , a @entity4 national guard base came under attack in @entity267 , @entity263 @entity262 unit spokesman @entity261 said			0
@entity4 troops were able to repel the attack but braced for another assault			0
two days earlier , @entity4 authorities said pro-russia militants shot down a military helicopter in eastern @entity4 , killing nine			0
@entity118 and the @entity274 have accused @entity30 of failing to take concrete steps to ease the crisis			0
@entity278 chief @entity277 urged @entity79 this week " to create conditions for the implementation of the peace plan , to end its support for separatist troops , and to stop the flow of weapons and fighters across its border			0
" @entity107 has shown signs of detente			0
at his request , @entity30 's upper house of parliament voted wednesday to revoke the president 's right to use troops in @entity4			1
