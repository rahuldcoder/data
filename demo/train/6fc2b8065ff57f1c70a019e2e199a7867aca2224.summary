the nation 's largest veteran organization , @entity2 , and one other veterans group , @entity3 , on monday called for the resignation of @entity5 secretary @entity6			1
the calls for his resignation came after months of @entity11 exclusive reporting on @entity13 veterans who have died while waiting for care at @entity5 hospitals across the country , including in @entity18			1
" it 's not something we do lightly			0
but we do so today because it is our responsibility as advocate for the men and women who have worn this nation 's uniform , " said @entity22 , national commander of the @entity2 , speaking in @entity23			2
responding to the legion 's call for the secretary 's resignation , the @entity5 issued a statement late monday : " @entity37 has dedicated his life to his fellow veterans , and nobody is more committed to completing the work that lies ahead , " said a @entity5 statement by @entity36 , @entity5 spokesman			1
" as the secretary says , providing veterans the quality care and benefits they have earned through their service is our only mission at @entity5			1
" the @entity48 also responded with a statement : " the president remains confident in @entity37 's ability to lead the department			0
" @entity11 's ongoing look at health care for veterans @entity11 has been reporting on delays in care and patient deaths at @entity5 hospitals for the past six months , including at hospitals in @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
after @entity11 's coverage , the @entity5 acknowledged this april that 23 veterans had died as a result of delayed care in recent years			1
but sources tell @entity11 that number could be much higher			2
in an exclusive report two weeks ago , @entity11 interviewed a retired @entity5 doctor from @entity18 who charged that more than 40 @entity13 veterans have died waiting for care at the @entity74 there			1
a fatal wait : veterans languish and die on a secret list many of the veterans , the doctor and other @entity5 sources told @entity11 , were placed on a secret list created by @entity5 managers to hide the wait times of veterans seeking medical care			1
@entity5 officials in @entity18 denied there was any secret list or that they had given any orders to cover up or hide wait times			2
they acknowledged that veterans had died waiting for care but said they did not know whether those deaths were tied to waiting for care			1
but following those reports on friday , @entity6 placed the @entity18 va director @entity96 and two members of her staff on administrative leave			2
on monday , @entity100 of the @entity2 said that growing concerns about the problems at numerous va facilities are what led him to call for the resignation of @entity6 and two other top @entity5 officials : under secretary of health @entity108 and under secretary of benefits @entity109			1
" these disturbing reports are part of what appear to be a pattern of scandals that has infected the entire system , " @entity100 said monday			0
another @entity5 facility under the spotlight also monday , the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity5 facility came under scrutiny as concerns were raised that officials there might have allegedly instructed workers to change records in an effort to make veterans ' wait times appear less severe			2
" @entity134 has learned of appointment scheduling manipulation occurring at the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity136 that is remarkably similar to issues recently referred to you regarding the @entity139 , " stated a letter to the @entity5 's @entity132 and signed by rep. @entity133 , @entity121			0
the director of health care at the @entity142 , @entity143 ' watchdog organization , told @entity11 on monday that even the @entity5 does not truly know how many @entity13 veterans are waiting for care across the country			1
director @entity147 said that 's because they do not keep careful track of how many " consults " or doctor - requested appointments are open at any given time			0
@entity147 said some of the @entity5 numbers and details of wait times are " unreliable			0
" the @entity5 reported that in just the last year , it basically cleared 1.5 million backlogged orders of patient care or services , which they call consults , but @entity147 said there is no way of knowing why they were closed			1
@entity147 said it is " a little disconcerting that 1.5 million records were closed			0
... we ca n't determine that they did a review , a clinical review and appropriately closed out the consult			0
" she added that to find out how many consults have been truly closed , " you 'd have to really go back to each individual patient record and see how the consult , why it was closed			0
" rebuffed on repeated interview requests throughout the network 's reporting , @entity11 has submitted numerous requests for an interview with @entity6			1
yet in the six months that @entity11 has been reporting on these delays , @entity6 has not publicly spoken about the issue			1
@entity11 is not alone in getting virtually no response from @entity5 officials			1
@entity13 rep. @entity187 of @entity188 , chairman of the @entity189 , issued this statement late monday : " for nearly a year , we have been pleading with top department leaders and president @entity193 to take immediate steps to stop the growing pattern of preventable veteran deaths and hold accountable any and all @entity5 employees who have allowed patients to slip through the cracks			0
" in response , we 've received disturbing silence from the @entity48 and one excuse after another from @entity5			0
" @entity36 's statement , released by the @entity5 late monday , read : " the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously			2
if the @entity209 's investigation substantiates allegations of employee misconduct , swift and appropriate action will be taken			0
veterans deserve to have full faith in their va care			0
" under the leadership of @entity37 and his team , @entity5 has made strong progress in recent years to better serve veterans both now and in the future			2
the secretary knows there is more work to do			0
" @entity5 's progress includes enrolling 2 million more veterans in high - quality @entity5 health care , reducing veterans ' homelessness by 24 percent , providing @entity230 educational benefits to more than 1 million students , and decreasing the disability claims backlog by nearly 50 percent			1
" but veterans groups were not convinced			0
late monday , another veterans group joined the @entity2 in the call for @entity6 to resign			1
@entity236 , ceo of the @entity237 , issued the following statement : " we 're proud to stand with @entity2 as they take this courageous and historic stand			0
as @entity13 's largest veterans organization , their moral authority on this issue is unimpeachable			0
we applaud their demands for accountability at the very top of the @entity5			0
" tears , angry accusations mark hearing on delayed @entity5 care january : veterans dying because of health care delays january : @entity143 demands answers november : a dire situation in @entity61			2
