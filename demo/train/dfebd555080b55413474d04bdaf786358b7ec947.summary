@entity1 politicians and @entity3 officials expressed concern on thursday after it emerged that a seven - year - old article criticising a former @entity7 chief executive was set to be removed from @entity9 's search results			1
the action , which comes as the internet search company responds to the @entity3 ruling on the " right to be forgotten " by removing articles from its @entity16 search rankings , led to accusations of censorship and over-reach			1
titled " @entity7 's mess " , the 2007 blog post by @entity23 , now the @entity25 's economics editor , describes how @entity26 left the @entity28 investment bank after it suffered huge losses on risky investments			0
in a blog post on wednesday mr @entity23 said the search company had in effect removed his article from the public record , " given that @entity9 is the route to information and stories for most people "			1
he had earlier received a " notice of removal " from the search company , informing him that his article would no longer appear in the results of some searches			1
in may , the @entity47 , the @entity3 's highest court , ruled that individuals had the right to request the removal of search results linking to " inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant " personal data -- even if the information had been published legally			1
@entity9 -- which opposed the court decision -- responded by introducing an online form giving visitors to its @entity16 sites a formal route to make removal requests			1
in the first four days after uploading the form , @entity9 received more than 41,000 requests			0
two senior @entity3 officials said @entity9 's removal of the @entity25 article was a misinterpretation of the @entity47 's ruling			1
one , who did not want to be named , said : " the ruling and the @entity68 have made it clear that the right to be forgotten should not be applied for journalistic work			0
" earlier this year @entity72 , who stepped down this week from being the @entity3 's justice commissioner to become a member of the @entity75 , said the court had " made clear that journalistic work must not be touched ; it is to be protected "			1
however , the @entity47 's ruling was a little more intricate			0
the court said the right to privacy could be waived if " justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having , on account of its inclusion in the list of results , access to the information in question "			0
but it also added that in some cases the public interest argument was valid only for the search engine of a news site , not for that of a general search engine such as @entity9			2
legal experts said the decision to remove mr @entity23 's article highlighted the complexity of interpreting the new @entity3 law and the difficulty in applying it to @entity9 , which now had to act as a de facto freedom of expression regulator			1
" there are some cases that are clear - cut but the majority of cases will be in a grey area like this one , " said @entity106 , a partner at law firm @entity107 in @entity108			0
" now it 's up to @entity9 to understand whether an article is in the public interest or not			2
that 's tough for a company			0
" @entity119 , a @entity1 conservative mp , said : " this draconian @entity16 court ruling risks turning internet search engines from being the great 21st - century emancipators of millions of ordinary people into arbitrary censors -- and a refuge for scoundrels and crooks looking to airbrush away their own unsavoury history			1
" @entity129 , a @entity119 mp on the culture select committee , said : " if critical articles are removed from @entity9 searches at the request of persons named or unnamed , it could pose serious questions for lawmakers , the media and society			1
" @entity140 , a former @entity141 culture secretary , added that the company appeared to be over-interpreting the court ruling			2
" mr @entity23 is right to say the information he published is still relevant , " he said			0
" i ca n't see why @entity9 would do this			0
it is either a mistake or could be an attempt by them [ @entity9 ] to whip up a storm of indignation against the regulatory authorities in an attempt to influence the bigger battles to come			0
" a link to wednesday 's article posted to the @entity25 journalist 's @entity157 feed has been retweeted more than 600 times			0
mr @entity23 conceded that he could simply be " the victim of teething problems " as the search company begins to implement the rules			2
he added , however : " there is an argument that in removing the blog , @entity9 is confirming the fears of many in the industry that the ' right to be forgotten ' will be abused to curb freedom of expression and to suppress legitimate journalism that is in the public interest			2
" the @entity25 has a right to appeal against @entity9 's move and seek the view of the @entity1 's data protection regulator , which has the right to overturn the search engine 's decision			2
it is not clear who requested the removal of the article from @entity9 's search rankings			1
mr @entity26 was the only individual named in the 2007 article , but mr @entity23 pointed out in an update to his wednesday night blog post that the request could have come from any of the readers who commented beneath the original article , or anyone named in those comments			0
the blog post continued to appear under certain searches on @entity9 's @entity1 site on thursday			2
@entity9 does not plan to remove links to personal information from the @entity28 version of its search engine , meaning @entity16 can visit @entity201 to search for information removed from their local version			0
