@entity0 -- reliability -- that was the watchword for president @entity3 when it came to legacy - making choices for the @entity5			1
reliability in both the person he wanted for the high court , and in the selection process itself			0
the former president 's new memoir reveals a measure of success and uncertainty along the way during six crucial months in 2005			2
in " decision points , " @entity3 offers a behind - the scenes look of his successful nominations of @entity21 and @entity22 to the high court			1
both men have lived up to @entity26 expectations after five years on the bench , becoming influential conservatives			0
but there is bitterness , too , over how his pick of close aide and friend @entity34 failed so spectacularly , which he blamed not so much on himself , but on those from the left and right			1
" while i know @entity34 would have made a fine justice , i did n't think enough about how the selection would be perceived by others , " the former president writes			1
" i put my friend in an impossible situation			0
if i had to do it over again , i would not have thrown @entity34 to the wolves of @entity0			1
" i covered the @entity3 judicial nominations , and much of what @entity3 reveals now was what i had learned at the time from my sources			1
i knew that early in his presidency he had laid out a simple set of criteria for who he wanted for the federal bench , creating a disciplined , thorough vetting process to assure " reliable " conservatives would be chosen			0
@entity3 wanted a short list of high - court candidates ready to go			2
that list would include " women , minorities , and people with no political litmus test , " @entity3 wrote			2
" the only tests in my mind were personal integrity , intellectual ability , and judicial restraint			0
" while there was some diversity , most of those eventually tapped for the courts were white males , including the two @entity5 justices			2
the president most of all sought someone who would stay conservative for perhaps decades on the court -- no " surprises " as @entity3 's father had learned			1
" i knew how proud @entity83 was to have appointed [ justice ] @entity84 , a wise , principled , humane man			0
i also knew he was disappointed that his other nominee , [ justice ] @entity87 had evolved into a different kind of judge than he had expected , " @entity3 writes , referring to his father , former president @entity85			1
the moderate - liberal @entity87 retired in 2009			0
as far back as the @entity91 years , right - leaning legal activists had sought to transform the courts away from what they called the " excesses " of a liberal legacy championed by former chief justice @entity96			0
from watershed rulings on abortion , criminal rights , and church - state disputes , frustrated conservatives knew the impact life - tenured federal judges would have on hot - button social issues			0
@entity106 insiders were always seeking to identify bright , young , up - and - coming lawyers to hopefully one day transform the courts			0
. one such person was @entity21 , who had served in the @entity91 and senior @entity3 administrations			1
he was a well - paid @entity0 appellate attorney when he played a low - key but crucial role defending the younger @entity3 in court during the 2000 @entity114 ballot recount			1
the @entity26 remembered , and groomed him for a potential seat on the high court by first naming him in 2003 to a prestigious federal appeals court			0
@entity0 was abuzz in the early summer of 2005 , anticipating a high court vacancy after 11 years of stability			2
then - president @entity3 and others assumed chief justice @entity123 -- suffering from thyroid cancer -- would step down , but @entity3 reveals in his book that @entity126 , then the @entity26 counsel , had called him the morning of july 1 with a surprise			1
" it 's [ @entity130 , " @entity3 writes that @entity34 told him			1
the pioneering first woman on the @entity5 was leaving after nearly a quarter - century			2
@entity21 was one of five finalists -- all federal appeals - court judges -- personally interviewed by @entity3 in subsequent weeks , but he was not the unanimous choice of the president 's top - level staff			1
vice president @entity137 and attorney general @entity138 wanted texan @entity139			0
but political adviser @entity140 and chief of staff @entity141 preferred @entity21			2
the 50 - year - old @entity143 native impressed the president			0
" his command of the law was obvious , as was his character , " writes @entity3 , " a gentle man with a gentle soul			1
" based on what my administration sources were telling me , and what i knew of @entity21 , i had predicted @entity3 would ultimately choose him			1
@entity3 revealed now what my sources back then had said would be a key criteria , beyond the resume and conservative credentials : " i wanted to read the person , " face - to - face , he writes			1
" i went into the interviews hoping one person would stand apart			0
" his gut told @entity3 that @entity21 would be a reliable conservative judge -- and more			1
" the tie breaker question , " writes @entity3 was which man would be the most effective leader on the court			1
" note that @entity3 wrote " man , " and while one woman was among the finalists , judge @entity167 was never seriously considered , my administration sources told me			2
in retrospect , the decision was not a hard one			0
the difficult part for the president was at the prime - time announcement ceremony , where @entity21 , his wife , and two young children gathered at the @entity26			1
@entity179 @entity178 started dancing around the @entity180 -- he was imitating @entity181 , it was later revealed -- while @entity3 was speaking			2
" i saw him out of the corner of my eye , and it took all my concentration to continue my remarks , " @entity3 writes			1
barely six weeks later , high drama			0
@entity123 suddenly died during the @entity189 , and now there were two immediate @entity5 vacancies			2
@entity21 ' confirmation hearings were about to start , and the @entity3 team acted fast			1
a day after the chief justice 's funeral , they tapped @entity21 for the top spot , and now had to refill the @entity130 seat			2
this time , @entity3 said he was determined to change course -- name a woman and perhaps someone with no judicial experience			2
" i did n't like the idea of the @entity5 having only one woman , justice @entity206 , " he says in his book			2
his wife @entity209 " agreed -- and shared her views with the press			0
" miers fit the bill , but was " shocked " when the president asked her to be his nominee			0
one new tidbit revealed in the memoir was that the other top candidate besides @entity126 -- @entity218 , like @entity3 a @entity220 native whom he had named early in his presidency to a federal appeals court seat			1
@entity3 now admits strong , discreet pushback to @entity34 from his own staff			1
some " argued that it was too risky to pick someone with no established record on the bench , or that we would be accused of cronyism			0
several told me bluntly that she was not the right choice			0
" the president again went with his gut , but claiming none of his advisers " told me to expect the firestorm of criticism we received from our supporters			0
" that hostile reaction from the right clearly irks the president to this day			0
he writes about the " unspoken " elitist arguments against @entity34 , also a fellow @entity220 who had not gone to an @entity246 law school			1
" she is not glib			0
she is not fancy , " writes @entity3 of @entity126 , singling out traits he seemed to appreciate			1
my sources at the time said @entity3 was not looking for outspoken , abrasive , or egotistical judges			0
low - key , friendly , loyal were qualities he zeroed in on , along with a fierce intellect and proven conservative credentials			0
he found that in the personalities and paper trails of @entity21 , @entity34 to a limited extent , and later @entity22			1
" i had to get the next pick , " writes @entity3			2
" while the idea of selecting a woman appealed to me , i could not find any as qualified as @entity22 , " the candidate miers herself had earlier championed			0
the former president recalls his initial july meeting with @entity22 , in which the @entity269 native " seemed ill at ease			2
" @entity3 says he broke the ice by talking about a shared passion -- baseball			0
@entity22 is a huge @entity273 fan			0
he is also , as @entity3 writes , " as reserved as they come			1
" @entity22 survived a tough @entity276 confirmation , which @entity3 labels as " nasty ... i was disgusted by the demagoguery			1
" at the january 2006 @entity26 swearing - in , the former president writes , " i had a moment alone with @entity22			1
i thanked him for enduring the hearings and wished him well on the court			0
then i said , ' @entity22 , you ought to thank @entity34 for making this possible			1
' he replied , ' mr. president , you 're exactly right			0
' " despite the still puzzling @entity34 misstep , @entity3 clearly believes he hit home runs with @entity21 and @entity22			1
for those nominees , the disciplined vetting process went exactly as the @entity26 hoped , and the two have certainly re-energized the conservative majority on the court to this day			0
one final note : @entity3 's memoir reveals little about his thoughts on the 2000 post-election fight , and the high court 's crucial role in stopping the recount , in essence handing him the presidency			2
he defends his strategic decision to have the justices ultimately decide whether the vote - counting should continue in contested @entity114 precincts			0
" i was prepared to accept my fate " with the high court , @entity3 writes , " the country needed closure , one way or the other			1

former president @entity3 writes about his @entity5 picks in his memoir
he writes about his successful nominations of @entity21 and @entity22
there is bitterness over the *treatment* of close aide and friend @entity34
" if i had to do it over again , i would not have thrown @entity34 to the wolves of @entity0 "
