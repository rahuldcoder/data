-- as a young child in @entity3 , rugby star @entity1 strained to hear tales of his heroes through the crackles of an old transistor radio			1
those radio waves carried stories of his idols across the seas into the ears of an enraptured @entity1			2
it was the 1970s , before television arrived on the shores of the tiny island nation cast 1,700 miles off the east coast of @entity18 in the @entity19			0
although it has a population of just 870,000 , @entity3 's obsession with the oval ball has helped it stand shoulder - to - shoulder with global superpowers			1
in @entity25 , @entity3 gave rugby a player blessed with such flare , flamboyance and outrageous natural talent , that on many an occasion @entity30 was able to stun @entity32			1
" i started to get interested in rugby in 1977 , " @entity1 , who played 36 times for the @entity3 's @entity35 team , told @entity0			1
" i was in my school uniform in @entity3 , and then people were all happy and shouting and i asked my mum , ' why are these people happy ? ' " they said , ' oh @entity3 has just beaten the @entity42 , and rugby makes people in @entity3 happy			1
' " so , i thought , if i have an opportunity to play for @entity3 , i 'll try and make people happy			2
" @entity3 's famous win over the @entity42 came in the 15 - a - side version of the sport but , while @entity1 went on to become a member of the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) @entity52 and played at three @entity53 , it was in the seven - a - side game that he excelled			1
sevens is a scaled - down , fast - pace version of rugby union that requires quickness of mind and body and bucket loads of stamina			2
at his peak , @entity1 possessed all three in spades , so much so that he was dubbed the " @entity65			1
" if @entity1 was the king , his royal residence was the @entity67 -- the most famous date on the @entity70 calendar and a tournament followed religiously in @entity3			1
" it 's a big burden for the players , " said @entity1			2
" when they come to the @entity67 , they have to win to make their name back home in @entity3			1
" when @entity3 wins the @entity67 it 's a good 12 months for us until the next @entity67			1
" but , when we lose the @entity67 , it 's the worst 12 months			2
it 's always like ' oh no we have to wait for another year ! ' " gallery : @entity84 triumph in @entity67 luckily for @entity1 , he enjoyed a plethora of successes during his 17 - year career , including seven triumphs in @entity67			1
in two of those glorious years , 1997 and 2005 , the tournament doubled up as the @entity92 and it 's those wins which @entity1 remembers most fondly			1
" when we won the @entity92 in 1997 , the whole people of @entity3 , in @entity95 and all over the world were so excited , " he explained			1
" in 2005 , i was so happy that my little boy was here , he was aged three or four and i carried him and took the cup with him home			0
" they even closed the airport because the people were coming in and they wanted to meet the plane coming down from the sky			0
" at his final @entity67 as a player , @entity1 illustrated why he is so revered			1
in the semifinal match against @entity84 in 2007 , he received the ball inside @entity3 's 22 - yard line , proceeding to effortlessly slalom his way through three attempted tackles before off - loading the ball to his teammate on the halfway line			2
" i saw the two @entity84 guys were like coming and i went straight to their eyes and i could see they were arriving but their eyes told me that they were gone			0
that 's why i stepped two of them ... they were both tired ... i was running slowly because i did n't have any more energy too and the defenders were coming close			0
" i dummied my way and they all went and i went through the middle straight in , and i passed to one of our guys			0
" @entity1 summoned the energy for one last - gasp burst , receiving a final pass before striding to the try line with the ball raised above his head in jubilation			2
" i ran nearly 150 meters , " he recalls			0
" i was about to die when i scored the try			0
" not bad for a 38 - year - old			1
with his boots now firmly zipped up in his kitbag , the 45 - year - old @entity1 is focused on finding the next generation of sevens talent			1
@entity141 was set up in 2010 by the now retired star and three @entity144 - based partners			0
it aims to encourage children into the sport all over the world , with a specific focus on growing rugby in @entity151			0
the organization has teamed up with @entity153 in a bid to find more players like @entity156 , a former collegiate track prospect who resisted overtures from the @entity160 to sign with @entity162 rugby team @entity161			0
the aim is for @entity1 and @entity153 to establish a network of training camps from which the country will draw its squads for the @entity70 and @entity169 competitions , with the sport set to make its @entity171 debut in 2016			0
" @entity153 has given me a lot , " reflected @entity1			0
" twenty one years of rugby			0
i want to give back to rugby so that i can help rugby kids			0
we started in @entity144 and now it 's beginning in a lot of other states in the @entity179 ... we are going into schools in the @entity179 , they are getting us to go into elementary schools and take their physical education classes so that we teach the kids how to play			0
" if @entity1 ca n't inspire a breakthrough generation of @entity179 rugby stars , then nobody can .			2

@entity95 rugby idol @entity1 is known as the " @entity65 "

during his 17 - year career , he won the @entity67 on seven occasions
he also led @entity3 to two @entity92 triumphs
