an emotional @entity3 did not address that issue directly in a televised statement from the @entity2 on the shootings at @entity21 in @entity22 that killed 26 people , but he said something had to be done			1
" we 're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this , regardless of the politics , " said @entity3 , the father of two girls			1
he wiped away tears when he spoke of the " beautiful little kids " killed in the massacre			0
complete coverage on the @entity14 school shooting police recovered three weapons from the scene : a semiautomatic .223 - caliber rifle made by @entity39 , a @entity40 and a @entity41 , both handguns , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
others also spoke out for a strong federal response			0
" we can not simply accept this as a routine product of modern @entity51 life			0

gun rights generally divide @entity51			0
a @entity79 poll conducted after the 2011 assassination attempt on rep. @entity81 , @entity82 , which killed six other people , found that 49 % of @entity51 said it was " more important to protect the rights of @entity51 to own guns , " while 46 % said it was " more important to control gun ownership			2

" for a long time , these gun violence rates and massacres spoke for themselves			0
they relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful but very well - disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart , " @entity131 said			0
