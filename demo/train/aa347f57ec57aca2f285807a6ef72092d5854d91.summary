-- @entity2 superstar @entity1 celebrated his return from injury by scoring @entity6 's winner against 10 - man @entity7 on saturday night , keeping the pressure on @entity11 leaders @entity12			1
@entity1 ended a six - week absence as he came off the bench in the second half and slotted home his eighth goal this season with eight minutes to play to give @entity6 a 2 - 1 away win that left the capital club a point behind defending champions @entity12			1
the midfielder , who cost $ 100 million when he signed from @entity22 in june , fired in a low effort across goalkeeper @entity24 after running into the box to collect a precise pass from fellow big - money acquisition @entity27			0
@entity27 was also involved when real , knowing they had to win after @entity12 's earlier 3 - 1 victory against bottom club @entity31 , finally took the lead five minutes after halftime			1
the @entity35 forward was quickest to react after @entity24 could only first parry a low shot by @entity37 and then block the former @entity40 star 's own attempt , and veteran forward @entity41 was in the right place to sidefoot home the resulting cutback pass			0
@entity41 , who came on for injured @entity46 midfielder @entity45 in the first half , also hit the post in the 26th minute			0
@entity7 , just two points above the relegation zone , were reduced to 10 men only a minute after @entity41 's goal when @entity53 was sent off for aiming an elbow at @entity37 -- the @entity55 went down clutching his face even though the on - loan @entity59 defender 's limb appeared to strike his chest			2
@entity41 also left the pitch with an injury , to be replaced by @entity65 forward @entity64			0
but the home side , promoted back to the top flight this season , shocked real by equalizing in the 61st minute as on - loan striker @entity70 broke free on the counterattack and rounded goalkeeper @entity72 to slot the ball into the empty net			2
@entity75 headed against the @entity7 woodwork from @entity78 's free - kick as @entity6 pressed for a winner , which came after the 75th - minute introduction of @entity1			1
@entity12 bounced back from the 3 - 1 midweek defeat against @entity82 , which followed a long bus trip to northern @entity59 due to the volcanic ash cloud that closed @entity86 's airspace			1
coach @entity87 rotated his squad ahead of wednesday 's second leg of the @entity91 semifinal , and @entity92 and @entity93 took advantage of their call - ups to put the @entity96 2 - 0 up inside 25 minutes			1
the 22 - year - old winger @entity92 curled in a fine 14th - minute effort after linking with @entity99 , while @entity65 forward @entity93 was set up by strike partner @entity100			2
@entity31 pulled one back just a minute later with a fierce shot from @entity102 that caught @entity12 napping after a mistake by defender @entity104 , but @entity100 restored the hosts ' two - goal cushion 11 minutes as halftime after @entity109 midfielder @entity108 laid on an easy chance			1
@entity31 ended the match with nine men as @entity113 and @entity114 were red - carded for bad tackles in the final minutes , and are now six points from safety with four matches to play			1
it was @entity99 's 200th victory in 349 appearances in a @entity12 shirt , extending his club record			2
" it was a dangerous game because however much you prepare tactically , your mind is on last tuesday 's match and the one we will play on wednesday against @entity82 , " @entity87 told reporters			0
" today we played thinking about @entity82 , and it was inevitable because it 's just so important for us			0
" @entity132 consolidated third place with a 1 - 0 victory at home to @entity136 in the late match , with striker @entity138 scoring the only goal from the penalty spot in the 34th minute after defender @entity141 handled the ball			2
@entity143 moved seven points clear of fourth - placed @entity145 , who host @entity147 on monday			0
the only blot on the night was the late sending - off of substitute @entity150 , who received two quickfire yellow cards			0
the first spell also ended on a bizarre note as the referee blew for halftime before the required 45 minutes were played , and then had to restart the match after protests from both sides .			0
