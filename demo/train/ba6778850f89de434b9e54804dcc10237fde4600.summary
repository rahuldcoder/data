data from communications between satellites and missing @entity3 was released tuesday , more than two months after relatives of passengers say they requested that it be made public			1
but criticism quickly emerged suggesting that the information provided lacks important elements that would help outside experts put the official version of events to the test			1
@entity16 authorities published a 47 - page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the jetliner and the @entity22 company @entity21 's satellite system			1
the information provided is n't the whole picture but is " intended to provide a readable summary of the data communication logs , " the notes at the beginning of the document say			1
in the weeks following the plane 's march 8 disappearance , a team of international experts used the satellite data and other information , including radar data and engine performance calculations , to conclude that the aircraft ended up in a remote area of the southern @entity40			1
some passengers ' families , unsatisfied by the official explanation of the plane 's fate , say they want an independent analysis of the complex information , a process that could take some time			1
@entity49 , one of the most vocal experts among those calling for the release of the data , said a very preliminary review suggested that there were gaps in the notes explaining the data			1
the explanatory notes at the start of the document " answer a few of the questions we have had , but leave many questions unanswered , " he told @entity59			2
@entity59 safety analyst @entity67 said certain key elements , which would allow independent experts to fully test the official conclusion , are missing from the data in the document			1
" there 's not enough information to say whether they made an error , " he said			2
" i think we 're still going to be looking for more			0
" @entity21 ceo @entity77 acknowledged tuesday that the company did n't release the model to which it applied the data to estimate the plane 's path -- and said the decision on whether to release the model lies with the @entity16 government , which is leading the search			1
" we 'd be perfectly happy to put that model out , " @entity77 told @entity59 's " @entity88			1
" but @entity77 also told @entity59 that the released data is enough -- along with engine and radar data -- for experienced third parties to plug into their own models and reach their own conclusions			1
" you should n't read anything into any gaps in the data , " @entity97 vice president @entity96 told @entity59 's " @entity102 " on tuesday			1
" this is a very goodwill and focused way that we 're trying to communicate our best impression of what happened			0
" @entity108 , whose partner , @entity109 , was on the missing jet , said she was " annoyed " that @entity21 and @entity16 authorities had n't released everything they used to reach their conclusions			1
" i see no reason for them to have massaged this before giving it to us , " she said			0
is @entity21 right ? @entity119 guided search for weeks , @entity21 said it did n't have the authority to release the data , deferring to @entity16 authorities , who are in charge of the search for the plane that disappeared over @entity128 while on a scheduled flight from @entity130 to @entity131			1
last week , the two sides announced that they would aim to make the information available to the public			2
the satellite signals -- called " handshakes " -- with @entity3 were part of a larger set of data that investigators have used to try to establish the whereabouts of the missing @entity142 with 239 people on board			2
the handshakes continued to take place for roughly six hours after the aircraft dropped off radar screens			0
months of searching by dozens of planes and ships in the southern @entity40 has so far turned up no wreckage , and investigators have not been able to say for sure where the remains of @entity3 might be			0
the underwater search for the missing plane will effectively be put on hold this week , and may not resume until august at the earliest , according to @entity159 's top transport safety official			1
analysts have said the release of the satellite data could help discount some theories about what happened to the jetliner , and potentially fuel new ones			2
relatives of people who were on the passenger jet , scientists studying its disappearance and media covering the search have become increasingly critical about the lack of public information about why the search has focused on the southern @entity40			2
" i think far too much has been left to experts who have remained behind the curtain , " said @entity177 , whose wife , @entity178 , was on the flight			0
@entity21 confident even though more than 80 days have passed without searchers finding any wreckage from the plane , @entity21 officials say they remain confident in their data			1
" yes , to a high degree of probability , we are certain that our data is right , " @entity96 said tuesday			2
in an exclusive interview with @entity59 's @entity193 last week , @entity21 's vice president of satellite operations said the company 's calculations have been tested by other people			1
" no one has come up yet with a reason why it should n't work with this particular flight when it has worked with others , " @entity197 said			2
" and it 's very important this is n't just an @entity21 activity			1
there are other people doing investigations , experts who are helping the investigation team , who have got the same data , who made their own models up and did the same thing to see if they got the same results and broadly speaking , they got roughly the same answers			2
" experts came to the conclusion that the plane had ended up in the southern @entity40 by piecing together three types of information , he said			2
" we have actually the messages from the ground station to the plane and back again			0
that essentially tells you the terminal is switched on and powered up			0
we have some timing information and in addition to that there were some frequency measurements , " he said			0
the timings told them the distance between the plane and the satellite , enabling them to map out arcs			0
then they factored in frequency differences , determining that the plane had headed south			0
' the right work ' it was a startling conclusion -- and @entity249 says investigators made sure to repeatedly check their calculations before sharing them			0
" you want to make sure when you come to a conclusion like that , that you 've done the right work , the data is as you understand it to be , " he said			0
now , @entity249 says he 's well aware that the entire weight of the search rests on the @entity21 data			1
" this is all the data we have for what has happened for those six or so hours , " he said			0
" it 's important we all get it right and particularly that everyone looking at the data makes the best judgments on it and how it 's used			1
and particularly for the families and friends of the relatives on board , try and make sure that we can help bring this sad incident to a close			0
" @entity276 said he thinks the expertise of the @entity21 team and the level of testing to which their work was subjected justifies their confidence in their conclusions			2
" it is up to the detractors and doubters to come up and say why they believe it 's wrong , " he said			0
" not the other way around			0
" @entity108 acknowledged that independent analysis of the data may support @entity21 's conclusions			1
" that would be a fine outcome as far as i 'm concerned , " she said			0
but if the independent experts come up with alternative flight paths based on the data , @entity108 said , then " those need to be investigated			0
" the wait for data the issue of making the satellite data public has become the cause of confusion and contradictory statements			0
@entity108 said the families had first asked for the data more than two months ago			0
" it seemed a relatively innocent request " at the time , she said , but authorities refused to release it			0
@entity16 officials told @entity59 earlier this month that their government did not have the data			1
but @entity21 officials said the company provided all of it to @entity16 officials " at an early stage in the search			1
" " we 've shared the information that we had , and it 's for the investigation to decide what and when it puts out , " @entity96 said earlier this month			2
but a senior @entity16 official told @entity59 that the government needed @entity21 's help to pass on the data to families " in a presentable way			1
" " we are trying to be as transparent as possible , " the official said			0
" we have no issues releasing the data			0
" @entity108 said the delay only added to questions surrounding the information			0
" it 's a little curious to me why this had to become such a big deal , " she said tuesday			0

" you should n't read anything into any gaps in the data , " @entity21 official says
@entity21 ceo : we did n't release model we used to *crunch* data ; it 's up to @entity16 government
the information is lacking important elements , a @entity59 safety analyst says
