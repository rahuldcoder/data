@entity0 -- if president @entity3 fancies himself a modern @entity4 of " @entity5 , " standing up for what 's right when his allies desert him on @entity8 , he might be following advice the marshal got in the iconic 1952 @entity12 film			1
@entity4 , played by @entity13 , goes to his mentor and predecessor @entity15 in a last - ditch plea for help , but the former lawman -- crippled by age and arthritis -- declines and explains why everyone from the judge to the deputy to the church - going folks of @entity27 backed off			1
it 's all happened too sudden , " says @entity15 , played by @entity29 " people got to talk themselves into law and order before they do anything about it			1
" @entity3 bought himself time for that discussion on whether to attack @entity8 over the use of banned chemical weapons by putting the question to @entity40 , setting up @entity42 committee hearings this week and votes in both chambers after the @entity45 returns from summer recess on september 9			1
stunned by what @entity48 officials call a major chemical weapons attack on august 21 , less than two weeks ago , @entity3 initially tried to put together an international coalition to respond immediately to punish the regime of @entity8 president @entity53 and signal widespread resolve			1
with @entity55 undermining any @entity48 @entity57 action , @entity3 hoped for a coalition similar to the one forged for the 2011 air strikes on @entity60 -- led by @entity62 allies with backing from @entity65 states			1
congressional hawks tie @entity8 to military budget cuts that plan crumbled last week when @entity70 's @entity69 voted against taking part in a military intervention in @entity8			2
both @entity73 and @entity74 , while agreeing that the international community must respond to the @entity8 chemical weapons attack , also have balked at military intervention without @entity79 approval			0
even with backing for an international response from regional powers @entity81 , @entity83 and others , @entity3 decided to force @entity40 to take a stand instead of using presidential authority to order a @entity48 strike			1
his arguments for acting sound like a modern " @entity5 " script			0
@entity3 looks to @entity40 to bolster legal case for @entity8 strike " this attack is an assault on human dignity , " he said saturday in detailing his decision to seek congressional authorization			1
" it also presents a serious danger to our national security			0
it risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons			0
" citing a possible escalation in the use of chemical weapons without a response , he added that " in a world with many dangers , this menace must be confronted			0
" " we can not raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say , the accords we sign , the values that define us , " @entity3 said			2
however , the response he then outlined sounded a bit less direct than marshal @entity4 's shootout in the streets with @entity124 's gang			1
a @entity48 strike would be self - wounding " this would not be an open - ended intervention , " @entity3 said			2
" we would not put boots on the ground			0
instead , our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope			0
but i 'm confident we can hold the @entity53 regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons , deter this kind of behavior , and degrade their capacity to carry it out			0
" to @entity1 national security analyst @entity142 , @entity3 's surprise decision to seek congressional authorization was strategic			1
" he probably calculates that for @entity145 skeptics in @entity40 , they will have to explain to the @entity48 public why it is that they will not sanction military action on @entity8 after its large - scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe @entity8 's closest ally , @entity152 , and its nuclear weapons program -- which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons -- as a grave threat to the world , " @entity142 wrote monday			2
. for @entity157 who generally oppose any @entity48 military action , " @entity3 can essentially ask , ' if not now , when ? ' " @entity142 continued			2
@entity3 posed that question saturday in his remarks to the nation			2
@entity8 vote could have consequences for 2016 " what message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price ? " he said			0
" what 's the purpose of the international system that we 've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98 percent of the world 's people and approved overwhelmingly by the @entity40 is not enforced ? " insisting the decision goes well beyond the issue of chemical warfare , @entity3 argued that " if we wo n't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act , what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules , to governments who would choose to build nuclear arms , to terrorist who would spread biological weapons , to armies who carry out genocide ? " opinion : @entity3 on war -- a realist and risk taker " we can not raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say , the accords we sign , the values that define us , " he said , channeling a bit of marshal @entity4			1
rep. @entity209 , a conservative @entity210 @entity145 , told @entity1 on monday that @entity3 is " standing up for what he believes , and i agree with the president " on the need to respond militarily to what he called " horrendous war crimes being committed against the civilian population " of @entity8			1
" i just do n't think it 's something we can look the other way and say , ' well , it 's halfway around the world			0
who cares ? ' " @entity209 said			0
and we also have a strategic interest there because our adversaries are not stopping			0
" that sounded like @entity3 , not @entity15 in " @entity5 , " who tells @entity4 the reason nobody will back him is that " maybe because down deep , they do n't care			1
they just do n't care			0
" military has concerns about @entity8 mission			0

president @entity3 may feel like marshal @entity4 in the iconic @entity12 film
abandoned by his allies , @entity3 decides to go to @entity40 for *political* cover
in the film , @entity4 is told that " people got to talk themselves into law and order "
by seeking congressional approval , @entity3 buys himself some time
