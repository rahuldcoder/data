@entity0 -- the suicide bomber who killed seven @entity6 officials and a @entity8 military officer last week in @entity9 was a @entity8 double - agent , a former @entity3 intelligence official told @entity1 monday			1
the bomber was a source who came to the base camp in @entity15 near the @entity17 border for a meeting on december 30 , a senior @entity3 official also confirmed			1
the man had been used by both countries ' intelligence services in the past , and had provided information about high - value targets , the senior @entity3 official said			1
" yes , it was a joint @entity3 - @entity8 source who had provided over the period of his cooperation a lot of very detailed good information that was of high interest at the most senior levels of the @entity3 government , " the former @entity3 intelligence official said			1
the security breach occurred because the bomber was met off - base by @entity3 intelligence officials who failed to search him before they put him in a car and drove him onto @entity39 , the former intelligence official said			1
both the @entity8 and @entity3 intelligence services believed the man was loyal , according to the former intelligence official			1
" clearly there is a lot of soul searching " at @entity6 headquarters in @entity47 , according to the former intelligence official			2
the bomber was identified as @entity51 , from the @entity8 town of @entity53 , also home to the late @entity55 , the one - time leader of @entity56 in @entity57 , the former intelligence official said			1
both the @entity8 and @entity3 intelligence agencies apparently believed @entity51 had been rehabilitated from extremist views and were using him to hunt @entity61 , the second - ranking @entity56 official to @entity62 , the former intelligence official said			1
@entity8 intelligence services have long covertly cooperated with the @entity3 , specifically in the hunt for @entity61 and @entity62 , because of the ability of @entity8 agents to blend into the @entity56 organization , noted the former intelligence official			1
also killed in last week 's attack in @entity9 was @entity71 captain @entity70 , a cousin of @entity72 of @entity8			1
the @entity8 government has not publicly commented on the specific circumstances of @entity70 's death , but @entity3 sources confirmed @entity70 was present and was the @entity8 operative working closely with @entity51			2
the @entity6 refused to comment monday , saying the matter was under investigation			0
the bodies of the seven @entity6 employees were flown to @entity82 in @entity83 to a private ceremony attended by cia director @entity85 , other agency and national security officials , and friends and family			0
a @entity8 official who did not want to be identified said @entity70 " was killed on wednesday in the line of duty as he was taking part in a humanitarian mission carried out by the @entity96 in @entity9			1
" the @entity8 official added : " @entity8 's position in the war on terror is clear ; we are fully committed to fighting @entity56 , which is a threat to @entity8 as it is a threat to the @entity3			2
we are also committed to continuing our cooperation with the @entity3 and the international community in the fight against terror and in defeating @entity56			0
" in a posting on its web site last week , the @entity107 in @entity9 claimed the bomber was an @entity111 soldier			2
on sunday , however , @entity17 @entity107 chief @entity112 said in an e-mail that " we claim the responsibility for the attack on the @entity6 in @entity9			2
" " the suicide bomber was a @entity8 national			0
this will be admitted by the @entity6 and the @entity8 government " the message said			0
the attack occurred at a forward operating base , which a @entity3 intelligence official acknowledged was a crucial @entity6 post and a " hub of activity			1
" the main purpose of @entity6 forward operating bases in @entity9 , officials have noted , is to recruit informants and to plan and coordinate covert operations , including drone surveillance and targeting			2
the attack was " a huge blow , symbolically and tactically , " because it eliminated such a large number of @entity6 officers , who can require years to become ingrained in the region , said @entity137 , director of analysis for @entity139 -- an international intelligence company			0
in addition , the attack showed the ability of the @entity107 to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets -- a @entity6 base , she said			0
former @entity6 official @entity146 called it " the greatest loss of life for the @entity6 since the @entity150 bombing " in 1983 , which killed eight agents			0
an @entity3 intelligence official vowed last week that the @entity3 would avenge the attack			2
two of those killed were contractors with private security firm @entity157 , formerly known as @entity157 , a former intelligence official told @entity1			0
the @entity6 considers contractors to be officers			0
on sunday , a local administration official and an intelligence official told @entity1 that two guided missiles struck a compound in the @entity17 village of @entity165 in @entity166 suspected of being a gathering place for local and foreign militants			0
the attack killed @entity170 , a teacher ; his 9 - year - old son ; and three people from outside the country , according to the sources , who said the missiles were believed to have been fired by an unmanned drone			0
there was no immediate @entity3 confirmation of the missile attack .			0
