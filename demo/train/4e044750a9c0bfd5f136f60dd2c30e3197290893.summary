-- the debates this presidential primary season have been less like @entity3 than former heavyweight champ @entity4 -- punch - drunk pugilism , providing entertainment and some great upsets along the way			0
but for all the excitement of the fights , there is a civic cost to the radioactive rhetoric that gets thrown out to excite the conservative crowds			2
it 's not just that the most irresponsible candidates can play to the base and get a boost in the polls , while more sober - minded candidates like @entity21 fail to get attention			2
the real damage is to the process of running for president itself			0
because when low blows get rewarded , the incentive to try to emulate @entity28 -- holding yourself to a higher standard -- is diminished			0
and one barometer of this atmospheric shift is in the increasingly overheated rhetoric by candidates attacking the current president			1
this serial disrespect ends up unintentionally diminishing the office of president itself			0
look , i know that politics is a full - contact sport : elbows get thrown and egos get bruised			0
but ask yourself if @entity45 ever called @entity46 a socialist or a communist on the stump			1
sure , there were deep philosophical and policy disagreements between them , and @entity46 was called a failed president many times			0
but there was a lingering respect for the office that retained an essential bit of dignity			0
it was only the far - right fringe who indulged in the kind of rhetoric we now hear routinely from presidential candidates			1
for example , @entity64 gained steam early in the primary process by accusing president @entity68 of having a " @entity71 @entity70 mindset , " and invoking the specter of a " @entity68 's secular socialist machine			1
" as a highly compensated historian , @entity64 should have known better than to say that @entity68 is the " most radical president in @entity77 history			1
" but then accuracy -- or even aiming in the general vicinity of the truth -- is n't the point			1
@entity82 raised eyebrows this past weekend for saying @entity68 wants to impose a " phony theology " on @entity77			1
@entity82 has since tried to clarify that he was not trying to raise doubts about the president 's religion and i 'll take him at his word			0
likewise , when @entity82 compares @entity91 primary voters to members of the " greatest generation " called to act against the rise of @entity95 , i 'll assume that @entity82 is n't intentionally comparing the president to @entity97			1
but a month ago , when a @entity82 supporter accused @entity68 of being " an avowed muslim " who " constantly says that our @entity100 is @entity101 " and " has no legal right to be calling himself president " -- @entity82 did nothing to correct her			1
instead , he told @entity0 : " i do n't feel it 's my obligation every time someone says something i do n't agree with to contradict them			2
" but i think standing up for the truth in the face of unhinged hate is part of a potential president 's job			1
four years ago , at the height of the general election , when a supporter called then - candidate @entity68 an " @entity121 , " @entity117 corrected her			1
he said , " no , ma'am			0
he 's a decent family man ... ( a ) citizen that i just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues			0
" that 's the voice of a loyal opposition , putting patriotism above partisanship			0
even the sober - minded @entity128 has gotten into the hyper - partisan pandering game lately			0
maybe he 's trying to compensate for a lack of enthusiasm on the far - right with red meat rhetoric , but the effect is desperate			2
for example , when @entity128 was barnstorming through @entity137 , a standard part of his stump speech was this : " sometimes i think we have a president who does n't understand @entity77			2
" this line was straight out of the " alien in the @entity143 " playbook , a riff that reinforced the worst impulses of some in the audience , as one woman at a @entity128 rally named @entity151 eagerly reaffirmed when i asked her what she thought of the line : " @entity68 does n't understand @entity77			1
@entity68 is against our @entity100 and our democracy			1
" after his big @entity161 win , this line of @entity128 's scripted victory speech stood out : " president @entity68 demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy			1
" @entity128 knows this is n't true , but he 's been convinced that it works and he seems to be willing to say whatever it takes to make the sale			2
here 's what 's most troubling about this trend : it does n't seem remarkable anymore			2
for the candidates and many in the press , it is just the new normal , the cost of doing business			2
the overheated rhetoric simply reflects the conversation that 's been going on at the grassroots for a long time			2
like a frog in a slowly boiling pot of water , we do n't realize that the heat is killing us until it is too late -- except that the casualty here is the quality of our civic debate and the bonds that are bigger than partisan politics			0
it 's @entity193 ve to think it will stop when mr. @entity68 is no longer president , whether that is in one year or five			1
because the next @entity91 president will inherit the political atmosphere that 's been created and find that it is almost impossible to unite the nation absent a crisis			1
some @entity202 activists will no doubt take a tactical page from recent conservative successes			0
this cycle of incitement -- where extremes inflame and empower each other -- will make our politics more of an ideological bloodsport and less about actually solving problems			0
perspective is the thing we have least of in our politics these days			0
but perspective is what the presidency is all about -- rising above divisions and distractions to make long - term decisions in the national interest			0
by pouring gasoline on an already inflammatory political environment , the @entity91 presidential candidates not only diminish themselves , they diminish the process of running for president , and make it less likely that they would succeed in uniting the nation if they actually won the office			1
join the conversation on @entity232			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			1

@entity235 : @entity91 candidates ' extreme rhetoric against @entity68 is damaging
politicians like @entity45 disagreed with opponents , but with *courtesy* , he writes
@entity235 : @entity117 stood up for @entity68 in the face of hate ; these candidates do n't
@entity235 : inflaming audiences with *distortions* of the truth will *backfire* eventually
