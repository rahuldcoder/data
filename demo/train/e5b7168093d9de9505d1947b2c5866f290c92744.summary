-- @entity1 , the head of the nonprofit organization @entity2 , tells the story she heard from an 8 - year - old girl from @entity5 who recently crossed the border without her family			2
" these kids were taken by drug cartels and others and would arrive back at their neighbors ' dead with their organs cut out of them			2
obviously , this little girl had seen stuff none of us could ever imagine			0
" the little girl 's relatives hired a " coyote " to smuggle her into the @entity19			2
" on her journey here , she was sold as a sex slave			0
finally escaping , this 8 - year - old crossed the @entity25 , " said @entity1			0
the @entity19 has a humanitarian crisis at its @entity28 border , as the number of unaccompanied children trying to enter the country has increased by 90 % over just last year			1
the @entity32 are also trying to turn this into a political crisis by accusing the @entity36 administration and the push for immigration reform for enticing more undocumented immigrants			1
once again , republicans are bashing president @entity36 , this time by using suffering children as their political pawns			1
every parent can imagine it 's not an easy decision to send your child with a stranger thousands of miles away to a foreign country			2
these are little kids , for crying out loud			2
that 's not something you do because you want to , it 's something you do because you have to			2
escalating violence in @entity54 is driving the new wave of migrating children			1
as the @entity61 reports , " although there has always been crushing poverty in @entity54 , violence in the region has escalated in recent years			1
for example , @entity62 has the most murders per capita of any country			0
drug cartels and gangs are at the root of the increased violence			1
some of these children are fleeing gang initiations , according to several reports			0
" while historically most of the children who came to the @entity19 illegally were from @entity74 , that changed in 2013 when for the first time the number of unaccompanied migrant children from @entity54 eclipsed those from @entity74			1
actually , the number of undocumented kids coming from @entity74 has decreased in recent years			0
nonetheless , @entity32 insist it 's @entity36 's fault			0
@entity32 @entity82 chairman @entity81 said , " many of the @entity36 administration 's policies ... have led to a surge of minors arriving at the @entity19 - @entity74 border			2
" @entity32 speaker of the house @entity88 alleged the president 's " lax enforcement at @entity74 's borders " are giving a " free pass " to immigrants trying to come to the @entity19			0
these claims ignore the fact that president @entity36 has deported immigrants at a higher rate than president @entity98 and is on track to have deported three million immigrants by the end of his presidency			0
one might call this rate of deportation inhumane or un-american , but no one could reasonably call it " lax " -- no one , that is , except @entity32 fixated on attacking the president no matter what			0
meanwhile , @entity115 senator @entity115 , implicating the president 's program of administrative relief for young immigrant " dreamers " brought to the @entity19 as kids , accused the president of " incentivizing " unaccompanied children to migrate with the promise of " citizenship for anyone in the world who arrives illegally in the country by a certain age			1
" @entity115 said , " president @entity36 is responsible for this calamity			0
" yet , the increase in unaccompanied children escaping @entity54 began back in 2009 , long before president @entity36 's @entity128 ( @entity128 ) program			1
and for those who think that the @entity19 should be even more aggressive in how it addresses the cases of kids who arrive here unaccompanied , it 's worth noting that the current procedures for unaccompanied minors under our immigration system were created under president @entity98			1
could the prospect of comprehensive immigration reform be part of the lure ? perhaps , though in a study of 104 migrant children from @entity146 , only one mentioned the prospect of immigration reform as a motivation			1
the @entity148 has announced new steps to address the violence and poverty in @entity54 that is pushing children to migrate , including providing $ 9.6 million to help @entity54 governments repatriate citizens and additional @entity156 funds to reduce crime and violence in the region			1
and if there is misinformation spreading in @entity54 about immigration relief for children crossing the border , possibly a deliberate misinformation campaign as @entity148 sources suggest , the @entity36 administration will be actively working to counter this with correct information , including the fact that young people recently arriving in the @entity19 do not qualify under @entity128			1
although @entity32 will continue to use this issue and other excuses to try to destroy the prospects for immigration reform , @entity172 and the @entity148 should keep pushing for reform , including a comprehensive path to citizenship			1
our government has made it incredibly treacherous to cross our borders			0
yet , people still take the grave risk to do so in order to seek security and opportunity			0
currently , the avenues for legal immigration are largely backed up and broken , not keeping pace with the realities of why people migrate nor the needs of business in the @entity19 that rely on their work			0
our broken system is only working for the criminal coyote networks that take advantage of immigrants ' hopes			0
if we fix our immigration system , people will have reasonable and accessible avenues beyond crossing the hot desert in desperation			0
immigration reform is not the cause of the crisis at the border -- immigration reform is the solution			1
it would be nice if @entity32 would face reality and be part of the solution instead of further exploiting these helpless kids in their endless vendetta against the @entity148 .			2

@entity220 : unaccompanied children trying to cross the border increased by 90 %
@entity220 : this is a humanitarian crisis , but republicans are turning it into a political crisis
she says escalating violence in @entity54 is driving the new wave of migrating kids
@entity220 : immigration reform is not the cause of the @entity28 border crisis , it 's the solution
