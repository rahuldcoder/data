-- the dispute between the @entity2 and the @entity3 over its @entity5 nickname and logo took a new turn wednesday when the school said the filing of petitions requires it to use the nickname and logo while the issue plays out , possibly in a statewide vote			1
the @entity2 has a policy against mascots " deemed hostile or abusive toward @entity17			1
" but people who favor the mascot filed petitions tuesday with @entity22 secretary of state @entity21			1
the petitioners have a two - pronged strategy			1
one move calls for the state constitution to be changed in order to stipulate the use of the @entity5 name			1
if certified , that measure would be on the november ballot			2
petitioners have until august to submit signatures			2
the other effort calls for voters to decide in june whether to repeal a law that permitted the school to drop the name			1
those petitions were filed this week			2
in the meantime , university president @entity40 said the school is resuming the use of the name and logo			1
" i want to reaffirm our respect for the laws of the state and the processes guaranteed under the @entity51 , " he said in a statement			2
the @entity2 said wednesday the " university is subject to the terms of the policy if it uses the logo and nickname			1
" " those terms include not being able to host @entity2 championship events and a prohibition against using the nickname and imagery on uniforms for student - athletes , along with cheerleaders , ( the ) mascot or band members , in any @entity2 championships , " said @entity57 , @entity2 director of media relations , in a statement			1
the wrangling has been complicated			2
the state legislature in early 2011 passed a law requiring the university to use the @entity5 nickname			1
but that law was repealed in november 2011 when legislators approved a bill that allowed the school to stop using the moniker			1
the state requires 13,452 certified signatures to put the law repeal issue before voters			2
@entity22 has about 684,000 residents			2
petition supporters said they turned in more than the minimum number of signatures			2
" by filing the petitions last night , the law as passed in early 2011 is now again in effect , " @entity21 told @entity0 on wednesday			0
" the law passed in november 2011 is now suspended			0
i have 35 days to review the petitions			0
if i find the petitions sufficient , it will be certified for the ballot			0
if not , the bill passed in november will again become the law			0
" @entity3 's rock - and - a - hard - place scenario marks the last gasp of a years - long controversy : @entity22 is the last holdout in the @entity2 's campaign to get schools to drop their @entity106 monikers or get tribal blessings to keep them			1
in 2007 , the @entity108 agreed to retire the @entity5 nickname by august 15 , 2011 , in accordance with the @entity2 's then - 2 - year - old policy on @entity106 mascots			1
@entity113 will be paying close attention to what plays out			0
as commissioner of the @entity117 , he is overseeing @entity22 's ascent from @entity120 obscurity to the far more lucrative stage of @entity122 " when we invited ( @entity22 's football team ) into the ( @entity117 ) conference , this was not an issue , " he said last summer			0
citing the conference 's " close , close ties to native american tribes " and the threat of boycotts , @entity113 said that he was on ' heightened alert ' wednesday , noting that @entity22 's conference membership -- slated to begin july 1 -- could be rescinded if the college presidents within @entity117 so decide			0
the 13 college presidents of the @entity117 -- including @entity40 of @entity22 -- are scheduled to meet in early june , according to @entity137			0
a message left by @entity0 with the @entity139 was not immediately returned wednesday			0
in 2005 , the @entity2 sought to end the longstanding controversy surrounding @entity106 mascots once and for all by ordering nearly 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed " abusive in terms of race , ethnicity or national origin " to either get @entity106 permission to use their name and likeness , or to come up with a new one			1
the resulting actions varied among the targeted schools			0
the @entity156 became the @entity157 ; the @entity158 became the @entity159			0
other schools satisfied the mandate by tweaking their name , like @entity163 , where the @entity164 are now known as the @entity165			0
others , like the @entity167 , whose name does not affiliate with a specific tribe , were allowed to keep their name so long as @entity106 logos and imagery were eschewed			0
schools with higher - profile athletic programs fared better			0
the @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 each obtained permission from their respective namesake tribes to stay the course			0
but the @entity5 -- winners of seven national championships in men 's ice hockey -- were denied such an endorsement from the @entity186 of the @entity187 .			1

@entity2 has a policy against mascots " deemed hostile " to @entity17
@entity3 uses @entity5 nickname and logo
many citizens want school to continue using them
but @entity2 said there would be *repercussions*
