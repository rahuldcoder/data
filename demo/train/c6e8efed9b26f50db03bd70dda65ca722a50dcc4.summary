-- @entity2 soccer star @entity1 has decided to quit @entity4 club @entity3 following his punishment for making a controversial " quenelle " gesture			1
@entity1 was last month banned for five matches and fined Â£ 80,000 ( $ 130,000 ) by the @entity9 following an incident during a match in december			1
@entity1 was widely criticized by performing the " quenelle " -- which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand -- after scoring against @entity12			1
the gesture , which he said was dedicated to his comedian friend @entity20 -- who uses it as part of his act -- is believed by some to be a @entity25 salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-semitism in @entity1 's homeland			0
an @entity29 was asked to consider if the gesture was " abusive and / or indecent and / or insulting and / or improper , " and " included a reference to ethnic origin and / or race and / or religion or belief			0
" both charges were proved , said the commission , but it added it did not believe @entity1 to be a racist			1
@entity3 , which is battling to avoid relegation from the top flight , decided not to appeal against the judgment			0
" i have taken the decision to free myself and put an end to the contract linking me with @entity3 , " @entity1 wrote in @entity2 on his @entity44 page on friday -- his 35th birthday			1
" following talks between the club and me , propositions were made to me in order to reintegrate me into the squad under certain conditions that i can not accept			0
" wishing to retain my integrity , i have therefore taken the decision to free myself and put an end to the contract linking me with @entity3 to 2014 , with immediate effect			1
" @entity3 , however , said friday it had yet to hear officially from @entity1 -- whose ban was due to start this weekend , with the club outside the @entity4 's bottom three on goal difference , having 10 matches to play			1
it said his @entity44 statement was " highly unprofessional " and constituted " gross misconduct " -- and said it had given the striker 14 days ' notice of termination as required by his contract			2
" the club notes @entity1 is unwilling to agree to the conditions set by it which may have enabled his suspension to be lifted and for him to resume training , " it said in a second statement			2
" these conditions were , firstly , that the club required @entity1 to apologize to it , its supporters , sponsors and the wider community for the impact and consequences of his gesture made on december 28 and secondly , that he accept a substantial fine			1
" the @entity9 had considered appealing against @entity1 's punishment , having been criticized by anti-racism groups over its alleged leniency			0
" we do not consider there is a real prospect of successfully appealing to extend the sanction imposed , " the @entity9 's director of governance @entity91 said thursday			0
" the grounds of appeal available to us are limited to legal challenges or to circumstances in which the sanction imposed is ' so unduly lenient as to be unreasonable '			0
that is a high test			0
" @entity1 joined @entity3 on a one - year deal in august , and his two goals against @entity12 on december 28 were his first for the club			1
he continued to play while the matter was being investigated , but was sidelined in february due to a knee injury			0
@entity1 has played for many of @entity110 's biggest clubs , including @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , as well as a short but highly - paid stint with @entity121 team @entity120			2
he played for @entity122 on 69 occasions , winning the 2000 @entity124 , but his only @entity126 appearance in 2010 ended in disgrace as he was expelled from the squad following an argument with coach @entity130			0
@entity1 was subsequently banned for 18 matches by the @entity2 federation , but decided to end his international career rather than serve it .			2
