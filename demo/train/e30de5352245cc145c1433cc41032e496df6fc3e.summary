president @entity1 has told @entity0 he does n't think @entity9 " has the faintest idea " what his organization does after the former world no. 1 said he 'd lost faith in the system			1
the @entity10 labeled compatriot @entity12 's 12 - month ban from tennis for missing a drugs test a " total injustice " and said he was now nervous to give any sort of sample			1
but @entity1 dismissed the six - time grand slam winner 's comments as unhelpful and said it was up to the sport to do more to fight against doping			1
" i do n't think @entity9 has the faintest idea what we do and if he wants to understand what we do i 'm more than happy to pick up the phone and talk to him , if he wants to talk to me , " he told @entity0			1
" if he wishes to then make a comment i might listen to him but for the moment i do n't think that was an informed statement			0
" @entity2 's role in the fight against doping in sport has been in the spotlight in recent months after a string of athletes failed tests in @entity41 and @entity42			1
and as well as @entity12 , @entity44 tennis star @entity43 also served a ban for doping offenses after taking a prohibited substance contained in supplements bought from a chemist			1
those cases have provoked disagreement within the game as to the best course of action , with @entity56 champion @entity55 calling the pair 's actions " unprofessional			0
" @entity59 , winner of 17 grand slams , said more testing needed to be done within the sport and also said players should give a sample when requested			0
but when asked if he knew how widespread doping in tennis was , @entity1 replied : " no i do n't and nor do i think tennis knows how widespread it is			1
" what i do know is they have a program and a commitment has been given			0
can they do more ? every sport can do more			0
" and when you get criticism from some of the champion tennis players about the number of times they 've been tested then i hope tennis takes notice of it			2
i know they have and i believe that they 'll address it			0
" @entity1 also said the fall from grace of cyclist @entity88 had been the best anti-doping message since he became @entity2 president in 2007			1
in january , @entity88 -- following years of strenuous denials -- admitted to doping throughout his storied career , after he had been stripped of his seven @entity94 titles			2
but @entity1 thinks @entity88 's descent has proved that drug cheats will be caught out and punished no matter what their status			1
" i think the @entity88 story was the best message in my six years as to the effectiveness of the anti-doping programs , " he explained			2
" what that said to me and the rest of the world was no matter how big you are , how tall , how successful you are , you can get caught and be dealt with			0
that man has been destroyed in terms of reputation and in terms of , perhaps , many other aspects of his life			0
" he 's been seen as a cheat , a bully , a liar -- there 's no doubt about that			0
once upon a time he was revered as one of the greatest champions in his sport , of all time			0
" the fact that someone as big as that is ultimately brought to justice shows that our code is effective			0
" as for athletics , @entity1 acknowledged that doping is " widespread " and said part of the reason might be that there are different resources available to tackle the problem in different countries			2
@entity41 has had 17 athletes banned for doping offenses since 2012 , while former 100 meters world record - holder @entity141 and three - time olympic gold medalist @entity142 are among six @entity42 to have tested positive this year			2
@entity1 said doping is not just a problem in successful sporting countries like @entity41 and @entity42 , but rejected the notion performance - enhancing drugs were beginning to ruin sport			1
there had been a suggestion that certain countries could be banned from the @entity150 if they refused to comply with anti-doping programs -- raising the prospect of @entity42 's six - time @entity150 champion @entity153 missing out -- but @entity1 said that was for the @entity155 to determine			1
" should the @entity156 take stronger steps ? i 'm sure if the evidence is there on the basis of difficulties with compliance in any particular country they would look seriously at that , " he said			0
" i think we have to stop for a moment and say , ' what is actually going on in @entity42 ? ' they do have an anti-doping program , it has not been effective , it has not been as good as it could have been and that 's what @entity2 examined			2
" we now have given them recommendations and we 've got a commitment to say , ' yes we dropped the ball but we 've picked it up again and we 'll get it right and we 'll do that quickly			0
' " @entity1 also said that @entity2 's revised code , which is due out this week , would allow the agency greater investigative powers and called it a " great jump forward			1

@entity2 president @entity1 replies to @entity9 's criticism
world no. 2 tennis star said he 'd lost faith in agency after @entity12 's ban
@entity1 tells @entity0 that @entity9 " has n't got the faintest idea what we do "
he says @entity88 case shows that no - one is above the *regulations*
