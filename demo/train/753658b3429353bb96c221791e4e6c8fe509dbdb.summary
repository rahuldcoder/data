-- this time , history did n't repeat itself			0
@entity3 rep. @entity2 tuesday won a special @entity5 election in @entity6 , topping @entity8 businessman and former @entity9 in an election marked by low voter turnout			1
the contest was the second time in three years that @entity6 voters headed to the polls in a special @entity5 election with national implications			2
in january 2010 , little - known @entity8 state sen. @entity18 upset @entity19 , the @entity20 's @entity3 attorney general , in a contest to fill the remainder of the term of longtime @entity3 sen. @entity24 , who died the previous summer			1
@entity18 's victory set the stage for the @entity8 wave in the november 2010 midterm elections			2
fast forward three years , and this time there was no upset			0
with 100 % of precincts reporting , @entity2 led @entity9 55 % -45 % , according to local media reports			1
@entity2 , who had led in all the pre-election public opinion polls , will serve the remaining year and a half of the term of longtime @entity3 sen. @entity37 , who stepped down earlier this year after being confirmed as @entity39 secretary of state			2
humble beginnings in his victory speech , the 20 - term congressman talked about his humble beginnings			0
" i was the first in my family to go to college			0
i drove an ice cream truck to work my way through @entity49 as a commuter			0
but thanks to the opportunities this country gave me , this son of a milkman is going to serve the state of @entity6 in the @entity5 , " said @entity2			2
@entity2 , 66 , held his election night victory party in @entity59 's @entity58 , the same hotel where @entity18 celebrated his upset victory in 2010			1
@entity18 , who lost his @entity5 seat last november when he was defeated by @entity63 @entity62 , passed on running in this special election , setting the stage for @entity9 , who had never held public office			1
" we can be proud of what we accomplished , literally starting from scratch five months ago			0
nobody knew who i was outside of @entity71 , a couple of little league baseball teams and the amazing people i worked with			0
but look at us now , " said @entity9 in his concession speech about 90 minutes after the polls closed in the @entity6			2
national democrats , taking no chances this time around , greatly outspent national @entity8 in the contest , which @entity9 acknowledged in his remarks			1
" we were massively overspent			0
we went up against literally the whole national democratic party and all its allies and the machine			0
but in face of all this diversity , we could not have fought a better fight , " added @entity9 , 47			2
no @entity8 upset while the @entity8 looked to comparisons to the 2010 special election and @entity9 aides predicted a shocker , much has changed since @entity18 's upset victory			1
president @entity94 's health care measure was facing key votes in @entity96 at the time , and @entity18 's victory gave @entity8 a key 41st seat in the @entity5 , allowing them to filibuster @entity3 initiatives such as @entity100			2
the tea party movement , formed less than a year earlier , was on the rise , and played an important role in support of @entity18 , a charismatic candidate			0
and many national and state @entity3 took the seat for granted as it had been in the party 's hands for decades			0
while there was still a lot at stake in this election ( a @entity8 upset in tuesday 's contest would take a bite out of the @entity3 current slim 54 - 46 majority in the @entity5 ) , and while partisanship is still just as bitter in the nation 's capital , the climate has changed a bit , the seat was not considered a crucial vote in any upcoming legislation and the face received much less national media attention than the 2010 campaign			1
low turnout special elections often draw low turnout , and this race was no an exception			2
with many of the high profile names deciding against running , the contest was generating little interest with the public even before it was overshadowed by april 's @entity139 bombings , which killed three people and injured nearly 300			0
combine that with possible voter fatigue ( this was the third @entity5 election in the state in the past three and a half years ) and a heatwave on @entity145 , and it all added up to an apparently record low voter turnout for the contest , far below the 52 % turnout in the 2010 special contest			1
concerned about low turnout , the biggest names in the @entity3 all traveled to @entity6 to lend @entity2 a helping hand			1
in the past three weeks , president @entity94 , vice president @entity151 , former president @entity152 and first lady @entity153 all campaigned with @entity2			2
in an e-mail following @entity2 's victory , the @entity154 said that they " built two predictive voter models to gauge support for @entity2 and turnout , applying the lessons learned from the @entity162 's 2012 innovative modeling efforts			1
" and a memo from @entity164 , executive director of the @entity165 , said that " the lesson from @entity18 's accidental win in 2010 was that @entity3 must never take a race for granted			0
months before senator @entity37 resigned to become secretary of state , the @entity165 began preparing for a likely special election in @entity6			0
" a rematch ? @entity2 will succeed @entity172			2
@entity3 gov. @entity173 appointed his former chief of staff to serve as interim senator after @entity37 stepped down			0
if he wants to stay in the @entity5 past next year , @entity2 will need to run for re-election in november 2014 , when a full six - year term will be at stake			2
@entity9 has hinted that he 'll run again , and minutes after the election was called , some national republicans already had their eyes on a rematch			1
" today marks the end of the first mile in the marathon to permanently fill the @entity187 seat			0
@entity9 is well prepared to win that marathon over the next 16 months , " said sen. @entity188 of @entity189 , chairman of the @entity190 , in a statement			0
marked by nastiness the race between @entity2 and @entity9 was marked by its nastiness , with both candidates leveling charges of hyper - partisanship to try and sway voters in the @entity6			1
the back - and - forth between the two candidates spanned a laundry list of issues			0
@entity2 demanded @entity9 release more of his income tax returns to shed light on a real estate transaction			1
@entity9 suggested @entity2 was n't a valid resident of @entity6 after three decades in @entity207			1
@entity9 called @entity2 " pond scum " for airing an ad that pictured him alongside @entity210			1
and @entity2 cast doubt on @entity9 's past as a private equity investor since his rival would n't disclose his list of clients			1
the sniping played out in television ads and in three debates , which featured pointed remarks from both candidates			0
in the final showdown , a tense moment arose when @entity9 challenged @entity2 on term limits - a policy that would have prevented the 20 - term @entity63 from remaining in @entity207			1
@entity2 countered by asking his @entity8 rival whether he 'd posed the same question to longtime @entity8 senators like @entity229 and @entity230			1
@entity2 , without explicitly accusing @entity9 of lying , expressed deep skepticism			1
the exchange got to the heart of the @entity8 candidate 's central takedown of @entity2 - that the longtime @entity3 congressman 's roots in @entity207 disqualify him as a voice for @entity6 voters			1
" who are the people going to trust to put people in front of party and politics ? " @entity9 asked at the start of the debate			0
@entity2 seemed to bristle at the suggestion he 's been outside of @entity6 too long , even going as far as reciting his home address in @entity250 where he said he 's lived for more than six decades			0
" the question is n't where you 're coming from , it 's where you 're going , " @entity2 said before launching into his own main takedown of his rival			0
" mr. @entity9 , he 's backing these tired old @entity8 ideas ... that 's a reflection of who he 's going to be with down in the @entity5			1

the election is marked by low voter turnout
@entity2 beats @entity9 55 % -45 %
democrats greatly outspend @entity8 in the contest
@entity9 has hinted he 'll run again
