how are @entity1 chefs putting their unique spin on traditional @entity5 cuisine ? who are the language police , and what do they really do ? inhabitants of @entity10 , @entity11 's largest @entity5 - speaking province , pride themselves on being different from their neighbors , and that sentiment extends from the language they speak to the food on their plates , and beyond			1
if there 's anything that unites all @entity20 , it 's their joie de vivre : @entity10 is a place where fun is taken seriously			1
consider these truths for a better understanding of the province : 1			0
this is @entity5 soil , with a language police this tiny francophone enclave has some of the strictest language laws in the world			1
@entity5 must be the predominant language on signs , retail or food service employees always greet customers in @entity5 , and there are even laws dictating whether parents can send their children to @entity41 or @entity5 school			1
@entity42 ! our home and delicious land about 80 % of the province 's nearly 8 million inhabitants have @entity5 as a mother tongue , and outside of multicultural metropolis @entity50 , most people only speak @entity5			1
time.com : @entity10 's war on @entity41 there 's an entity called the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) , otherwise known as the language police			1
they enforce the rules by doling out fines to noncompliant businesses , and are usually plain clothed and covert			1
recently , language tensions have risen among locals , and @entity55 overzealousness was the main culprit			2
there are @entity67 churches for sale given that @entity10 's most popular curse words ( " tabarnak " and " ostie " ) are derived from church terms , it 's not surprising the @entity72 once played a big role here , but today many of the parishes are empty and have fallen into disrepair			1
many of the buildings are for sale , and buyers have been difficult to come by			0
some are being demolished , while others have been converted for non-religious purposes			0
@entity50 band @entity84 recorded their @entity86 - winning album @entity87 in a church in rural @entity89 , @entity10 , but they recently put up their " @entity91 " ( little church ) for sale , citing a damaged roof			1
@entity10 has its own national holiday @entity95 is on july 1 , and while @entity20 still get that day off , those celebrations are muted compared to those of @entity98 -- known as @entity98 -- held a week earlier on june 24			1
because it falls right at the start of summer , the festivities are held outdoors			0
@entity10 has a robust francophone music industry , with its own stars , and @entity98 is the perfect time to check out the folk revival scene live			1
there 's a strong nationalistic component to the holiday -- especially for the current minority who believe @entity10 should be its own country			1
just be sure to wear blue and keep all @entity111 - related paraphernalia at home			2
@entity10 loves small town hockey the @entity114 are the only @entity10 - based team in the @entity115 , but outside of @entity50 , the storied @entity114 are n't unanimously adored			1
the province has its own junior hockey league for players aged 16 - 20 , the @entity119 , with teams hailing primarily from smaller towns ( including a few outside of @entity10 )			1
it 's the league where @entity115 @entity125 @entity124 and @entity126 cut their teeth			0
there 's also the rock ' em sock ' em minor - pro @entity131 , more famous for fights than goals			2
while @entity20 do n't participate in hockey en masse the way they used to , it 's still the most popular sport there , and in the winter , towns will erect their own free , outdoor rinks			0
many @entity20 speak joual the language of @entity143 has evolved considerably in the former @entity5 colony			1
each region has its own linguistic quirks ( they 're not all called joual , but the term has become a catch - all ) , and visitors from other @entity5 speaking places are often taken aback by the unique contractions and " anglicisms " that have crept into the daily vernacular			1
the most creative and colorful joual from the @entity50 region usually entails combining multiple words into one , lopping off extraneous syllables or casually dropping @entity41 terms with @entity5 pronunciation			1
for instance , most people simply say " weekend " instead of " @entity162			0
" sentences often end with " tsé , " which means " tu sais , " or " you know " ? @entity166 is considered a working - class dialect , so while it 's celebrated for being homegrown , people of a certain stature aspire to speak a more refined @entity5			1
@entity50 and @entity171 have their own haute cuisine scenes with almost no outside interference , @entity50 has forged its own strange culinary identity , bringing formal @entity5 education and homegrown ingredients to rich , meat - heavy @entity10 staples			1
expect a lot of foie gras ( duck liver ) , @entity183 scallops , @entity185 shrimp , organic vegetables , cheese and high - quality pork			2
for those interested in game , venison and caribou appear on some menus			0
in @entity171 , where the cooking scene is more youthful , there 's a fierce commitment to using only made - in - @entity10 ingredients			1
@entity10 is by far the world 's largest producer of maple syrup , and during the spring thaw in march , sugar shacks ( cabanes à sucre ) offer the tasty treat , poured over snow or with a full meal of pancakes , beans , pork and more			1
because cooking school is subsidized by the provincial government , trained chefs in @entity10 tend to come from more diverse backgrounds			1
even the poutine is being reinvented the cat is out of the bag concerning @entity10 's slimiest treat			1
the famous dish -- consisting of fries , sauce brune ( gravy ) and cheese curds -- is being copied in the rest of @entity11 , and has even made its way down to @entity224			2
in @entity50 specifically , some chefs have expanded upon the traditional poutine by adding fancier toppings like foie gras and duck confit			2
the greasy spoon ( or casse - croûte ) favorite is no longer just for famished drunks			0
a few towns in @entity10 claim to have invented poutine , but the loudest and proudest of those is @entity236 , an hour east of @entity50			2
@entity10 's biggest party is also when it 's coldest @entity239 du @entity10 is held every february in @entity171 , the provincial capital , and the success and sheer size of the event is a testament to @entity20 ' defiance toward the cold			2
there are myriad outdoor activities to partake in over the two - week - long , tourist - friendly festival , but the biggest draws are the massive , illuminated ice palace and the ice sculpture contest			0
the ice palace is meant to be the home of @entity251 , the festival 's smiling mascot			0
the big guy 's reach extends far beyond @entity239 though : he 's one of @entity10 's most recognizable faces			2
bear the cold : @entity10 's best activities are done outdoors ice fishing and snowshoeing -- two activities that were long ago done for necessity -- have evolved into beloved pastimes			2
wherever there 's a frozen lake in @entity10 , expect to see a handful of temporary huts over it			2
renting the necessary gear during the season -- which goes from december to february -- is a painless process			0
snowshoe technology has modernized dramatically			0
snowshoes do n't look like oversized tennis rackets anymore : they 're made with lightweight synthetic materials , and there are different types , depending on whether you 're walking in the deep snow for leisure or sport			0
in the summer , there 's the @entity280 : a network of bicycle paths that stretches across the province from @entity284 to @entity285			0
@entity286 modernized @entity50 , and there are still remnants of it montrealers can be shameless braggarts when it comes to civic pride , and the @entity294 the city hosted in 1967 , known simply as @entity286 , is considered by many natives to be a high - water mark for the city			0
much of the infrastructure built for the fair remains			0
the city 's underground public transportation system , the @entity302 , opened a year before the expo , and the dirt that was excavated was used to create the artificial island @entity306 , which is where the @entity308 racetrack and casino ( formerly the @entity310 ) are located			0
there 's also @entity313 67 , a gravity defying housing development originally conceptualized using @entity317 pieces ( and it shows ) , and the @entity318 , a geodesic dome that was originally the @entity320			0
another international pavilion that survived the test of time ? @entity325 's -- it 's used for private events now			0
the roads are in bad shape blame the weather , the materials used or government ineptitude , but @entity10 roads do n't seem to hold up as well as those of their @entity335 or @entity336 neighbors			2
in addition to mammoth potholes and cracks , road surface markings seem to fade quickly			0
road conditions are especially bad during spring , when the snow melts and temperatures rise			0
and that 's to say nothing of @entity50 's crumbling interchanges and overpasses , which probably look worse than they really are			0
be prepared to be redirected a fair bit during the summer , because that 's when most construction work is done .			0

the " language police " enforce strict rules aimed at preserving @entity5 in @entity10
a minority of the population would like to be independent of @entity11
chefs bring formal @entity5 education to rich , meat - heavy @entity10 staples
