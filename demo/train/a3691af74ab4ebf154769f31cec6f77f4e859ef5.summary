a @entity1 - area man who claimed he accidentally shot and killed a 19 - year - old woman he thought was breaking into his home was charged friday with second - degree murder , after days of pressure from her relatives seeking an arrest			1
@entity9 , 54 , also was charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony in the november 2 shooting of @entity16 , who authorities say was intoxicated and possibly disoriented following a car crash before @entity9 shot her on his @entity21 porch			1
@entity16 was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break - in , so @entity9 -- who authorities say shot @entity16 from behind a closed , locked screen door -- can not lawfully claim he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat , @entity23 prosecutor @entity22 told reporters friday			1
" i am saying we do not believe he acted in lawful self - defense , " @entity22 said			1
@entity35 , an attorney for @entity16 's family , hailed the charges , saying he believes the evidence points to murder , but that a jury could go for manslaughter if it disagrees			1
either way , he said , @entity9 was in the wrong			2
she may have been boisterous			0
she may have been loud			0
... ( but ) this man had absolutely no justification to take a shotgun and blow her head off , " @entity35 said friday , not addressing @entity9 's explanation to police that the gun discharged accidentally			1
@entity16 's father , @entity52 , told reporters friday he was thankful for the charges against " this monster that killed my daughter			0
" her mother , @entity57 , dismissed notions that the shooting was accidental			0
" you did no accident			0
you took a life , and you took a beautiful life that was starting to blossom into a beautiful woman , " @entity57 told reporters , addressing @entity9 , who was in custody elsewhere			2
@entity9 was arraigned on the charges friday afternoon , and he was being held on bail set at $ 250,000			2
report : blood alcohol level of slain @entity1 woman more than twice the legal limit the crash and the shooting the charges were the latest chapter in a case that received national media attention when @entity16 's family complained @entity9 , who is white , was n't immediately arrested and charged in the black woman 's death			1
they contended she might have been seeking help when she approached his home			0
authorities said @entity16 , of @entity1 , drove into a parked car in the city around 1 a.m. after her death , tests determined her blood - alcohol level was 0.218 % -- nearly three times the 0.08 % legal limit for drivers in @entity95 , the @entity23 medical examiner 's @entity96 said			1
witnesses said she left on foot , bloodied and disoriented , @entity22 said			0
@entity16 ended up on @entity9 's porch in neighboring @entity21 at least a couple hours later that morning			1
@entity9 told investigators he thought @entity16 was breaking into his home , and that the shotgun accidentally discharged when he investigated , police said			2
after 911 was called at 4:42 a.m. , the unarmed @entity16 was found dead with large shotgun wound to her face , @entity22 said			0
investigators believe @entity9 , standing in his home , opened the main door and shot the gun through a closed and locked screen door , @entity22 said			2
@entity95 law says a person has no duty to retreat in his or her own home , but to shoot someone and claim legal self - defense , the resident must reasonably believe he or she faces an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm , and must show that the use of force was needed to prevent this , @entity22 said			1
there was no evidence of forced entry , and this case does n't amount to self - defense , she said			1
one of @entity9 's attorneys , @entity131 , was not immediately available for comment friday afternoon , her office said			2
another attorney representing @entity9 , @entity131 's father , @entity9 , said this week that the death was a " tragic accident " and that his client was " completely justified in everything he did			1
" @entity22 said her office did n't feel @entity16 's intoxication was relevant in the decision to file charges			0
she added she did n't believe a toxicology test was done for @entity9			2
the second - degree murder charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison			0
the manslaughter charge , which alleges the weapon was aimed with intent but without malice , carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison			0
a conviction on the felony firearm charge would mean a mandatory two - year prison term to be served before any other sentence			1
the next court hearing is scheduled for december 18			0
@entity9 , an employee of the @entity159 , has been placed on administrative leave , authority spokesman @entity158 told @entity161			2
woman 's father : no reason for death at a rally outside @entity9 's house wednesday night , @entity16 's relatives and friends alleged that the white homeowner had racially profiled the woman			1
on friday afternoon , when asked if he thought race played a role in his daughter 's death , @entity52 demurred			2
" i believe that this man took my daughter 's life for no reason at all , from just one human being to another , " @entity52 said			0
" and we just want justice done			0
" @entity35 , the attorney for @entity16 's parents , told reporters friday that @entity9 was safe in his home , and he should have called 911 before shooting if he believed his life was in jeopardy , not after			1
@entity35 said the family did n't know where @entity16 was in the hours before the crash or where she was going			0
@entity16 's parents said she was a 2012 high school graduate who planned to take online classes and entertained thoughts of being a nurse or working in the automotive industry			0
" she could have been anything , but she 's cut short of that now , " @entity52 said			0
@entity1 woman 's autopsy leaves questions			1
