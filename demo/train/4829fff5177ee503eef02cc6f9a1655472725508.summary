-- in the heart of the bustling capital of @entity4 , @entity5 , a lone female taxi driver navigates her bright yellow cab through the unforgiving traffic			1
" i wanted to take this adventure , as i consider it an adventure , rather than an experience			0
thank @entity13 , i believe it is a nice adventure so far and i feel happy with it , " @entity12 says			2
@entity16 is one of only eight female cab drivers in a city where the profession is dominated by men			1
" for me , it 's a very normal job , and there is nothing wrong for women to try to join a field of work that we deem as male - dominated			1
i see nothing wrong with that if the woman has the required skills and abilities , " @entity16 says			0
female cab drivers started appearing in @entity4 's streets only earlier this year			1
while some welcome the transition , @entity16 is facing many challenges			2
" still the society is not used to such an idea -- that a woman joins a field of work that was only limited to men			0
and still there are some people who see it as strange			0
on the other hand , others get curious and wonder : how did you enter this area of work and why ? " @entity16 says			0
one factor that makes it difficult for women to break into a male - dominated profession is the high rate of sexual harassment in the country			1
in a recent report , the @entity58 for @entity59 ( @entity60 ) concluded that 83 percent of @entity58 women and 98 percent of foreign women in @entity5 have experienced sexual harassment in some way or another			1
" it 's usual here in @entity5 that women get subject to some minor acts when they drive a car			2
... some encourage and show support for me			0
others act by trying to block my way to show they are more skillful drivers and to prove that it 's a male - dominated job , " @entity16 says			1
however for an enthusiastic @entity16 , the rewards of her profession move beyond gender politics			2
" i am most interested in making my clients best satisfied at the end of the trip , regardless of their gender , as the common impression is that women are bad drivers , " she says			0
" to have both men and women as my clients and make them feel comfortable is the greatest success for me			0
