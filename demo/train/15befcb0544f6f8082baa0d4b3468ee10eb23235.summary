even by @entity1 standards , says @entity2 , @entity3 was special			1
" he was really exceptionally smart			2
@entity1 has a lot of really smart people , and @entity3 stood out even among that rarified environment , " says @entity2 , who was then one of @entity3 's professors at the @entity7 school 's computer science laboratory			1
" he liked working on the hardest problems , as opposed to the easier ones , because they would make more of a difference			2
" that kind of determination drove @entity3 throughout his short life			1
he was an @entity18 who joined the @entity20 army and served in an elite unit , though he could have avoided the military altogether			2
he was a mathematician who could have had a stellar academic career but decided to jump into business			2
most importantly , in the late ' 90s he saw a solution to what was then called the " @entity28 " and , with his company @entity29 -- co-founded with @entity2 -- made the @entity27 faster and more efficient			1
( disclosure : @entity31 was an early @entity29 client and remains one to this day			1
) @entity3 died on september 11 , 2001 , at age 31			1
he was on @entity34 , the first plane to hit the @entity35 , and was almost certainly the first person killed in the attacks on that horrible day			1
his life is now the subject of a new biography , " no better time : the brief , remarkable life of @entity3 , the genius who transformed the @entity45			1
" if you 've never heard of @entity3 , you 're not alone , says the book 's author , @entity47			1
that was partly due to his low - profile life and business -- @entity29 is an infrastructure company , and @entity3 was n't flashy with his instant dot - com millions -- and partly because his friends and family shied away from publicity			1
but she believes it 's a life that deserves to be celebrated			2
even at 31 , she says , he 'd already accomplished so much			0
there were so many different elements , she says -- his military service , his business leadership , his intellect , his savvy -- and she wanted to convey some of that energy to others			0
" it was about the way he lived , " she says			0
" i felt like if he was motivating me as much , i felt like i could do the same for readers			0
" ' like lighting a fire ' from the beginning , @entity3 seemed destined for big things			1
even as a child he was an accomplished violinist , performer and athlete			0
he loved computers , too , learning to program an @entity78 his father brought home in 1979			0
in 1984 , his family decided to move to @entity20 , and @entity3 grew up near @entity82			1
he often spent as much time weightlifting as on his schoolwork , the book notes ; nevertheless he aced his classes while developing an enviable physique			0
the latter would serve him well when he joined the @entity89 and tried out for the @entity90 , the secretive unit known for the famed 1976 rescue raid on @entity93 's @entity92			2
@entity20 was key to shaping @entity3 's temperament , says @entity47			1
" moving to @entity20 was like lighting a fire under ( his ) drive , " she says			0
" he wanted to squeeze every last drop out of every minute out of every hour out of every day			0
" the imprint of the country 's intensity and its people 's blunt manner were obvious to anyone who met him years later			2
some @entity29 colleagues found him abrasive , and @entity3 -- who had a fondness for words -- joked about being " obstreperous			1
" but he was also terrifically loyal , supportive of staff and worked as hard as anybody			0
" he was motivating , so if he did kick you in the butt and tell you to work harder , generally people responded very well to that , " @entity2 recalls			0
" people wanted to ' take the hill ' if he was saying that 's what we 've got to do			2
" it was enough to impress @entity2 , the academic who says in the book that he would have been perfectly happy to spend the rest of his life solving proofs			0
what attracted him to enter the private sector was " a chance for us to make a difference in the real world , " he says in a phone interview			0
" in the area where we worked , in algorithms and the theoretical side of computer science , often that work is good , deep work , but it does n't change the world			2
it does n't impact people directly , " adds @entity2 , now the ceo of @entity29			1
" with this work , we thought it would have relevance in the real world , and make the @entity45 be faster , more reliable , more secure			2
it was a chance that was pretty rare for us			0
" ' his potential was limitless ' you have to remember that the @entity27 we use today -- with practically instantaneous results , broadband - fueled streaming video and at - your - fingertips devices -- was practically unimaginable when @entity29 was founded in 1998			1
back then , with dial - up access and overworked servers , a page load could be as interminable as the drip of molasses			0
and so @entity29 -- the name comes from the @entity151 for " smart " or " clever " -- was born			1
but even with its killer app , which lowered the possibility of crashing servers , there was no guarantee of success , even in the late - ' 90s dot - com era			0
indeed , @entity29 's first attempt at impressing the venture capitalists who fund such dreams , the @entity1 $ 50k entrepreneurship competition , fell short			1
that only pushed @entity3 to work harder			1
the company struck pay dirt on an unlikely day , march 11 , 1999			1
that thursday two events shook the @entity27 : the opening of the @entity169 men 's basketball tournament and the first streaming of the trailer for " @entity172 : @entity173			1
" while servers crashed all over the country , @entity29 - supported machines handled the surge , and the company started taking off			1
the next two years were boom and bust -- for the @entity45 and for @entity29			1
in the aftermath of the company 's october 1999 ipo , @entity3 and @entity2 were briefly paper billionaires			1
the stock scaled $ 300 a share			0
then came the crash of 2000			0
dozens of dot - com companies folded			0
by 2001 , @entity29 stock was selling for less than $ 5			1
@entity2 says @entity3 never lost his concentration			1
" we were both pretty focused on getting the job done , and that was true whether the stock was at 350 bucks or 50 cents , " he says " it was positive reinforcement			0
if one of us got worried about a problem , the other would step in and say , here 's how we 're going to get past this one and here 's why it 's going to work out			2
" 9/11 nevertheless , things were particularly grim on september 10 , 2001			1
@entity2 remembers a session stretching late into the evening in which the executives had to decide whom to lay off , including some friends and colleagues who had been with them almost since the beginning			0
the next morning @entity3 had to fly from @entity211 to @entity212			1
" he probably barely got an hour of sleep before getting on board the next morning , " @entity2 remembers			0
@entity3 was sitting in seat 9b			1
with his @entity20 military training and understanding of @entity218 , he may have figured out what was going on , perhaps even tried to stop it			0
according to flight attendants ' calls relayed to authorities on the ground , the first passenger to be killed was seated in 9b			0
he was stabbed to death			2
friends have always pondered the what - ifs			0
@entity3 may have finished his ph.d. , something that always nagged at him			2
friends thought he could have entered @entity20 politics			0
or he could have become a high - tech household name , like @entity234 or @entity235			0
" those who knew him feel like the world was robbed , " says @entity47			0
" he was always searching for something greater			0
" @entity2 , who helped keep @entity29 going in the dark days after @entity3 's death , wonders as well			1
@entity29 has since become a multibillion - dollar company active in cybersecurity			2
perhaps @entity3 would have gone that direction , using both his mathematical mind and his military training to fight terrorism			2
" i think he could have done whatever he decided he wanted to do , " says @entity2			0
" i think his potential was limitless			0

@entity3 was a math genius who co-founded @entity29
@entity3 's *innovative* algorithms allowed the @entity27 to run faster , more efficiently
@entity3 may have been first person to die in the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks
he was likely stabbed to death on the first plane that struck the @entity35
