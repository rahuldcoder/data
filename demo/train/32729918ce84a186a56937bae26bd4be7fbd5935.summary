-- " @entity1 " left us hanging with its midseason finale last year , so we knew to expect surprises when the @entity7 show returned sunday			1
and oh , were there surprises			0
we talked with @entity10 -- aka @entity11 -- ahead of sunday 's premiere , and she said to watch for a different tone during the remainder of season four as the focus shifted to the journey of individual characters			1
she conveniently left out that her character 's backstory would be explored in a dream sequence , a scene that easily became one of sunday 's highlights			1
there was much - needed insight into @entity11 , including an apparent explanation on why she became so emotional when holding baby @entity28 -- she had had a son before ( not to mention a lover )			2
here are three other moments that still have us talking : 1			0
@entity32 's not dead , is he ? @entity32 was left in a horrid state after a prison attack in the midseason finale , and at first it seemed that he was going to be the first casualty of " @entity1 's " return			1
our panic grew after a struggling @entity40 thought his father was a goner when he could n't wake him up			2
during the seconds it took for @entity40 to draw and aim his gun , we wondered the same thing he 'd been wondering : could he survive without his dad ? thankfully , he did n't have to answer that question			2
@entity11 's walker " pets " and a disturbing discovery in addition to her backstory filling in some of the blanks , @entity11 revived something else from the past sunday : her " pets			1
" as she left the prison , she crafted another set of armless , jawless walkers to accompany her through the desolation -- but not before stumbling upon the decapitated head of @entity62			0
but @entity11 's a soldier : she pushed past the horror of finding @entity62 's zombie noggin and had the courage to end his life			1
her strength was on display again when she sprang back to life in a herd of walkers , slaying them with her weapon of choice , a katana			0
@entity40 becomes a man @entity32 , @entity40 and @entity11 were the only three from the original clan in sunday 's episode , which offered an especially intimate view of @entity40 's struggle			1
he was angry with his father , @entity32 , for the desperate state they 're now in , so much so he believes he can make it on his own and would n't care if his dad were dead			0
( that 's obviously not so true , given his hesitation to shoot him			0
) @entity40 did test out his solo survival skills , and although he nearly was turned into a walker , the experience left him unscathed and with a renewed perspective			0
@entity40 is becoming a man -- and one who clearly enjoys giant cans of pudding .			0
