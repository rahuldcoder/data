early sunday morning , the crew of a @entity41 patrol aircraft spotted a panga boat near @entity43 , suspecting " it was engaged in illegal activity , " said capt. @entity45			1
a panga is an engine - powered work boat often used off the coast of @entity2 or @entity50 and is typically 25 feet to 45 feet long , @entity45 said			1
the aircraft 's crew alerted the captain of the @entity54 , an 87 - foot patrol boat , which headed to the scene and noticed the panga " operating with no lights			1
" a small boat was dispatched from the @entity54 , and it headed closer to the suspect vessel			2
then , the panga accelerated and slammed into the small boat , forcing @entity19 and another @entity41 member overboard			1
two @entity41 colleagues on the same small boat recovered their shipmates , and all four boarded the @entity54 as it headed to the nearest port			0

around 5 a.m. sunday , about four hours after the initial crash , the panga was located about 20 miles north of the @entity5 - @entity2 border , according to the criminal complaint			1
@entity41 officers pulled up and ordered the boat 's occupants , at gunpoint , to exit the boat			2
they refused to comply , and the panga raced away			0
it then stalled , refused further orders , and sped away again , the complaint said			0
in the third try , a @entity41 officer pepper - sprayed both men on the panga			2

the suspects had entered the @entity5 " illegally from @entity2 , " according to the document			1
@entity13 told investigators " he was taking gasoline to some lost friends north of @entity101 , " and @entity14 said he 'd been offered $ 3,000 to transport gas to a waiting panga boat off the @entity5 coast			1
as for what happened early sunday , @entity14 said he heard people yelling " stop ! put your hands up ! " then " a series of gunshots before the @entity41 vessel collided with the panga , " the criminal complaint stated			0
