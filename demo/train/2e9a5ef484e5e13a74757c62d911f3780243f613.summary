-- a new round of @entity3 rumors and leaks are suggesting what some tech observers have been predicting for the past year : that a smaller , less expensive @entity7 is on the way			1
the talk of a 7 - or - 8 - inch version of the popular tablet ( the current model has a nearly 10 - inch screen , diagonally ) , comes on the heels of @entity15 announcing plans for the @entity17 , its own smaller tablet that will be more in the mold of @entity20 's @entity19			1
the @entity17 will have a 7 - inch screen and sell for $ 199 like the @entity22 , which has been one of the few @entity7 rivals to gain any real traction in the tablet marketplace			1
finally , @entity3 owns the name ' @entity7 ' on wednesday , @entity28 was quoting " two people with knowledge of the plans " who said @entity3 will release a smaller ipad by the end of the year			1
the so far the imaginary , or at least never - seen , device has been dubbed the " @entity40 " by speculators in light of the @entity38 of the same name			2
the sources said the gadget will have a screen between 7 and 8 inches wide , and one said that it will not have the high - definition " retina display " screen of the new @entity7			2
@entity3 rumors can be an amusingly hit - or - miss affair , with random speculation often gaining critical online mass among the millions of diehard @entity3 fans ( or , for that matter , detractors ) always on the lookout for what might be coming next			0
but as the months have gone on , more and more analysts have begun to believe that the arrival of a smaller @entity7 is a matter of " when , " not " if			0
" multiple tech sites also are pointing this week to a post from @entity64 tech site @entity62 ( @entity15 translation ) which quoted sources on @entity3 's supply chain in that country saying the new device will have a 7.85 - inch screen and be the same thickness as the ipad 2			1
despite a growing tide of " evidence " ( a term used with a hearty grain of salt here ) , not all tech observers are convinced			0
" so , will there be a smaller version of the @entity7 ? at the moment , there 's not enough evidence to say and , if anything , on balance it 's most likely not to be the case , " blogger @entity88 wrote for @entity89 " but that does n't mean we can rule it out			0
fortunately , speculation that the device could be launched by the end of year fits with the @entity3 's usual october @entity97 announcement -- so you might not have to wait too long to find out			2
" if the rumors are true , it would be @entity3 's biggest departure yet from the vision of co-founder and ceo @entity103 , who died last year			1
5 ways the @entity97 changed our lives @entity103 was adamant that anything smaller than the @entity7 would n't deliver the full " tablet experience			2
" " this size is n't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion , " he said of 7 - inch tablets in october 2010 , during @entity3 's quarterly earnings report			1
" @entity3 's done extensive user testing on touch interfaces over many years , and we really understand this stuff			0
" there are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users can not reliably tap , flick or pinch them			0
this is one of the key reasons we think the 10 - inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps			0
" @entity3 wins ban on two @entity131 devices : what it means for you is @entity135 steering @entity137 users toward pricier hotels ?			0

new reports say @entity3 could make a smaller ipad by the end of the year
sources tell @entity28 " @entity40 " would have 7 - 8 inche screen
that 's the same as the @entity19 and @entity15 's planned @entity17
the move would go against what @entity103 said is needed for a tablet
