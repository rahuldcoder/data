a @entity2 man claims in a new book that his biological father was the notorious @entity6 of northern @entity7 , who 's still sought by authorities , publisher @entity0 said tuesday			1
the @entity6 serial killer is believed to have killed five people in 1968 - 69 and gained notoriety by writing several letters to police boasting of the slayings , with swatches of bloody clothing as proof of his claims			1
the serial killer claimed to have killed as many as 37 people and has never been caught			0
now @entity21 , a vice president at the cleaning company @entity22 in @entity23 , is recounting his decade - long search for his biological father and has concluded that man -- @entity27 , who 's now dead -- was the @entity6 , the publisher said			1
on tuesday , police in northern @entity7 said they were n't aware of the book or its claims			1
" it 's an open and active case , so we do n't comment , " @entity32 police spokesman @entity31 told @entity33			2
" but ( it 's ) certainly something our homicide investigators will take a look at			0
" many claim to be child of the @entity6 killer added capt. @entity42 of the @entity43 : " we have talked to many people over the years			2
we 've gotten reports over the years from people who do n't pan out			0
this case is still open , and we still do accept tips or leads that may have bearing on the case			0
" @entity51 , one of only two survivors of the @entity6 , was just a college kid more than 40 years ago at @entity53 , just north of @entity32 , when he and a then - girlfriend , @entity54 , were attacked while picnicking			1
their attacker was a man in an eerie costume : he wore a black hood and black shirt with a white symbol on the front that looked like crosshairs on a gun sight			0
that image would later become the @entity6 's trademark symbol			2
on tuesday , @entity51 expressed reservations about the latest claim in the unsolved case			1
" i somewhat follow the news , but there has been no time in the last 40 + years when someone was not ( stirring ) the pot , " @entity51 wrote to @entity33 in an email			0
@entity51 was stabbed eight times , and @entity54 , between 10 and 20 times			0
she died a day later at the hospital , but was able to give a description of the attacker before she died			0
@entity21 was born in @entity81 and abandoned as a newborn in a stairwell of @entity23 apartment building			1
he was later adopted and " had an idyllic childhood , " the publisher said			0
about 10 years ago , when he was 39 , @entity21 's birth mother , @entity87 , contacted him for the first time			2
he then began his search for his biological father , with whom his mother had n't been in contact since @entity21 was abandoned			1
@entity21 , who is married with a child , kept a journal during the search , which became the basis for the book			1
@entity21 has bachelor 's degree in electrical engineering from @entity100			2
his book , " @entity102 : searching for my father ... and finding the @entity6 , " was co-written with journalist @entity103			1
" @entity21 and @entity105 construct a chilling psychological profile of @entity21 's father : as a boy with disturbing fixations , as a frustrated intellectual with pretensions to high culture , and as an inappropriate suitor and then jilted lover unable to process his rage , " the publisher said			2
@entity0 publicist @entity118 told @entity119 that " @entity21 's father had a criminal record in @entity32 ( ' forgeries , bad checks ' ) , and there was a strong resemblance between his father 's mug shot and the police sketch , " the magazine said			2
" if you look at @entity21 's photo next to the sketch of the @entity6 ( killer ) next to his father 's mug shot , you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance , " @entity118 told the magazine			1
" the @entity6 craved attention and wrote several letters to newspapers taking credit for his crimes			0
he also included cryptograms or ciphers that he claimed would shed light on his identity			0
but he was never caught			0
