-- as i knelt on the bedroom floor , on the phone with 911 , i did n't understand what was happening at first			2
i thought something had gone wrong -- or at least that the paramedics would have plenty of time to arrive			2
when your wife is pregnant , no one tells you , " by the way , she might skip labor , suddenly fall to the floor , and give birth			1
oh , and the umbilical cord might be tangled around the baby 's neck five times			1
" but that 's what happened at our house			1
minutes earlier , things had been fine			2
my wife thought that perhaps contractions were beginning , and it was possible -- she was about three weeks from her due date			1
we have a son who 's 3 years older			1
for his birth , she labored at home for about 16 hours before we went to the hospital , and still waited eight hours for the baby			1
this time , she suddenly doubled over , saying she was having intense contractions and needed me to do what i had done three years earlier -- push down on her hips to help relieve the pain			2
but it was n't enough			2
she quickly got down on all fours , moaning , and managed to get out the words , " call an ambulance			2
" i thought that meant she 'd need a stretcher to get to the hospital			2
turns out , she knew that our kid had decided to come crashing into the world without all the usual fanfare			2
but she was hurting too much to speak			2
all the agony of childbirth had hit her in a single wave			2
i told the 911 operator about the " glop of blood " coming out , and followed her instructions to set up towels and help my wife lie on her back -- though actually she lay on her side			1
then : " @entity63 it 's the head			1
what do i do ? i 'm holding my baby 's head ! " most people who hear i delivered my son imagine a sitcom			1
if this were one , the camera would zoom over to the list of delivery plans that my wife had created with our doula			1
in a hospital room , she would use " yoga techniques , " massage , a " birth ball , " and music as pain management techniques			2
" ok listen , i want you to support the shoulders and hold the hips and legs firmly			2
and remember the baby will be slippery so do n't drop it ok ? " the 911 operator said			2
i reached in , palms facing up , put my pointer fingers into the baby 's armpits , and helped guide the baby out			1
that 's when my heart started pounding even faster , and my adrenaline went from overdrive to supersonic			1
the umbilical cord was snaked around the baby 's neck , tightly			1
think a turtleneck with five circles			2
the baby 's eyes were shut and i saw no sign of breathing			1
as far as i knew , no sign of life			0
so as the operator went on reading the standard directions : " wrap the baby in a clean cloth or towel ... tie a shoelace tightly around the umbilical cord ... " i stopped following her			0
i focused on the neck			0
did n't even look down to see what gender the baby was			0
" @entity126 , the baby 's not breathing , " i said			1
" breathe baby , breathe			0
" my mind operates with briefcases of information			0
i opened up one filled with everything i had ever heard about real life births , including a child i know who was born not breathing for a couple of minutes			0
he turned out perfectly fine -- he had been getting oxygen through the umbilical cord			0
so i did n't want to tie it off just yet			0
i carefully unraveled the cord from his neck , trying not to jostle him , and placed him down on the towel			0
" let me give you cpr instructions , " the operator offered			0
but then , when i stroked him gently a couple of times , the baby opened his eyes , began to move , and began to breathe -- about a minute after he was out			0
i used a shoelace to tie off the cord just as the paramedics arrived			0
i picked up our 3 - year - old , who was on the other side of the room for all of this , and whom i had been reassuring throughout the whole process			0
" it 's ok buddy , do n't worry , everything 's fine , this just happens , " i kept telling him			1
together we ran downstairs to let the paramedics in			0
we all ran back up to the bedroom			0
that 's when my wife looked at me and spoke her first words since collapsing 14 minutes earlier : " it 's a boy			1
" for weeks after , that first image of my beautiful son as he emerged -- eyes closed , still , so pure in his newness -- was emblazoned on the inside of my eyelids			1
i saw it every time i blinked			0
to this day , i can still see and feel just about everything about that moment			1
i would n't recommend this , and it 's not something we 'd choose to do			1
if anything had gone wrong , the minutes it could take to get to the hospital could be the difference between life and death			0
but for my family , it turned out to be an incredible thing			0
it will always have been an experience of a lifetime , one the four of us shared -- just us			0
our older child already likes to tell the story of how @entity205 caught his brother , who was " covered in red paint			0
" it gives me a unique connection to my son , one i 'll feel throughout our lives			1
knowing that the first thing he heard upon emerging from the womb was me making sure he could breathe , that the first thing he felt was me holding him and unwrapping the cord , changes my relationship to him a little			0
it reinforces , in a powerful way , what just about all dads want our kids to have -- the feeling , the knowledge , that we will take care of them , protect them , provide for them			0
and do n't think i wo n't hold this over his head when we go through his rebellious teen phase			0
it 's given me a new appreciation for doctors who successfully deliver thousands of babies , and most of all for the heroics of women -- especially my wife -- in that moment , suffering through all they suffer through for the sake of bringing life into the world			1
it 's also heightened my own awareness of the gift of life			1
when it 's up to you to help your kid take his first breaths , you appreciate not only his but your own in a new way			1
the whole adventure of life -- growing , exploring , contributing , loving , all of it -- feels more exciting and more precious			0
it 's easy to get caught up in the rat race , the excitement of work , and the inner drive to chase all the great things the world has to offer			1
we all sometimes fall into traps that make us forget to seek balance -- to try to carve out enough time for family and for just enjoying life			0
but in the moment i delivered my son , what matters most -- my real values and priorities -- became crystal clear			1
every time i look at him , i 'm reminded of that feeling			0
by being born into my arms , my son gave me the ultimate reality check			1
@entity284 will be answering your questions and discussing this story on @entity288 and @entity289 .			0
