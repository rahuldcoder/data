-- the @entity1 and the @entity2 said thursday they are assisting in the investigation of a newborn baby who died of a rare bacterial infection that could be linked to powder - based infant formula			1
the two agencies are also investigating the case of another baby who survived after being infected by the same bacteria			1
both cases happened in @entity12 within the past month , but it was not clear whether they are connected			0
late wednesday , @entity15 announced it had pulled from its outlets nationwide all cans of @entity19 powdered formula that matched the size and lot number of the formula involved in the fatal case			1
the retailer said it removed the product " out of an abundance of caution " during the investigation , because it has still not been determined whether the formula caused the baby 's death			1
" we extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy 's family as they try to come to grips with their loss , " said @entity32 , a @entity15 spokeswoman			1
" as soon as we heard what happened , we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the @entity42 and @entity43 to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation			2
" the maker of @entity19 , @entity46 , said it is working with health authorities " to identify the source or cause of the infant 's infection , " though it remained " highly confident in the safety and quality of our products			1
" the formula involved is @entity56 in 12.5 - oz. cans , with the lot number @entity58			2
consumers who have purchased formula with that lot number should discard the product or return it to the store , according to the @entity12 @entity42 and senior services , which is in charge of the investigation			2
the infant died of an invasive @entity70 sakazakii infection , @entity12 health officials said			1
the bacteria is ubiquitous in the environment , but the source of infection is still unclear			2
because of a growing number of @entity70 infections among newborns , however , there is compelling evidence that milk - based powdered infant formulas are the source of infection , @entity12 health authorities said			2
the bacteria has been detected in other types of food , but only powdered infant formula has been linked to outbreaks of disease , they said			2
the @entity1 has collected samples of powdered formula , both opened and unopened , from the home of the deceased infant and the @entity15 store , located in @entity94 , @entity12 , @entity1 spokeswoman @entity95 said			1
the @entity1 has also collected samples of the water used to reconstitute the formula , which in this case was bottled water , not from the tap			0
test results are expected sometime next week , @entity95 said			0
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity103 said the agency is conducting separate tests of similar samples			0
@entity95 warned against jumping to conclusions in the case			0
" there has n't been a connection found with infant formula at this time , " she said			1
" we are investigating and the samples are still pending			0
we do n't have lots and lots of cases , we have one case , and we 're investigating this one very tragic case			0
" @entity95 said the @entity1 investigates between four and six cases of @entity70 infection in infants every year			0
because powdered infant formulas are not commercially sterile , the @entity1 recommends the following steps to reduce infection in newborn babies : -- prepare only a small amount of reconstituted formula for each feeding so as to reduce the amount of time the formula is held at room temperature			1
-- do not hold reconstituted formula for longer than two hours without refrigeration			0
-- minimize the time reconstituted formula is held in the refrigerator before it is fed. the @entity136 has guidelines for the safe preparation and handling of powdered infant formula , which include washing hands with soap and water , thoroughly sterilizing all feeding equipment in hot , soapy water , and preparing enough formula for only one feeding at a time			0
@entity0 's @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
