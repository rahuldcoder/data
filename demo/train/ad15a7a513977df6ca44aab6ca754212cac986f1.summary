-- standing on the spot where 50 years earlier the rev. @entity2 made " @entity3 " the clarion call of the civil rights movement , a broader call for equality rang out saturday			1
thousands rallied at the @entity9 to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic august 28 , 1963 , march on @entity11			1
leaders from civil rights , religious and civic organizations paid tribute to those who fought and continue to fight for racial equality , but the slate of demands today has expanded to other hot - button issues			0
income inequality , discrimination based on sexual orientation and mistreatment of immigrants were all themes espoused by the dozens of speakers			0
" i am a daughter of the civil rights movement , and as a daughter i am a beneficiary of all the good that resulted from the hard work , the sweat and tears , and the blood that was shed by the leaders and doers of that movement , " @entity28 of the @entity29 told the crowd			0
" and as a daughter and a beneficiary , i am now the burden - bearer of this generation 's civil rights movement			1
" @entity46 's difficult journey that burden , she said , includes equal rights for gays and fights against poverty and gun violence			1
attorney general @entity54 credited @entity2 's famous words for providing a foundation for the progress of the civil rights movement			1
" our focus has broadened to include the cause of women , of @entity63 , of @entity64 , of lesbians , of gays , of people with disabilities and of countless others across this great country who still yearn for equality , opportunity and fair treatment , " he said			0
many speakers invoked the killing of @entity75 as an example of where they see a lack of justice for @entity80			0
@entity81 , son of the civil rights icon , said his father 's vision was a nation without racial discrimination			1
" but sadly , the tears of @entity75 's mother and father reminds us that far too frequently , the color of one 's skin remains a license to profile			1
" in 1963 , " we could not have imagined we 'd be here 50 years later with a black president and a black attorney general , but that 's a measure of how far we have come , " civil rights activist @entity94 said			1
" but still , we march			2
" minorities have never wished their way to freedom , he said , but have worked their way up , and must continue to do so			0
the only class mlk taught " while i 'm elated that we 've come today to march on @entity11 , we must not only march on @entity11			2
we must stand for a genuine living wage and jobs			0
we must stand to end the ' stand your ground ' laws			0
we must stand against stop - and - frisk , must must stand against voter suppression , " bishop @entity109 of the @entity110 said			0
another theme repeated throughout the event was outrage at the @entity117 decision that threw out a key part of the @entity119			2
the court in june invalidated the formula used to determine which states or local jurisdictions -- mostly in the @entity124 -- could remain under special federal oversight , requiring approval from @entity11 before they can change voting procedures			0
that blunted much of the government 's enforcement power in states and localities with a history of discrimination at the polls			2
" we did n't forget the price they paid , " the rev. @entity136 said , referring to those on the front lines of the civil rights movement			1
" we 've fought too hard , our parents shed too much blood , there was too many nights in jail , for you to take our vote from us now			0
" @entity136 said organized protests to demand a reinstatement of the provisions are forthcoming			1
5 faces of the march on @entity11 @entity153 and @entity154 were at the first march on @entity11 50 years ago , and as the crowd grew on saturday , they reflected on the span in between			2
" it was a wonderful experience ( in 1963 ) because prior to that there were many things going on in the @entity162 that were not right , " @entity153 said			0
the injustices that existed in 1963 convinced @entity153 and her family and friends to attend the march			2
" we had to be there			0
we had to be a part of it , " she said			0
the fight for equality that the original march embodied remains a work in progress , @entity154 said , which makes saturday 's event so important			1
" we need this , especially now , " she said			0
both women wore buttons from the march in 1963			2
saturday 's event is the first of two rallies to mark the anniversary			1
president @entity185 headlines another event wednesday , the exact anniversary of the march on @entity11 , where @entity2 delivered the now - famous speech at the @entity189			1
