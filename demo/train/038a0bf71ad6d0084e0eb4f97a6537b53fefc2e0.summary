-- the look on moguls skier @entity4 's face said it all : a bronze medal felt like a loss to the defending @entity9 champion			1
after posting the top score in the qualifying round , it seemed her quest to become the first freestyle skier to win two gold medals was secure			2
but a mistake on the top of the course in the final round left her with a 21.49 , a bronze medal score			2
after finally regaining her composure , the 24 - year - old @entity22 tried to find a bright side : " it 's really unfortunate it 's at the @entity9 , but i 'm sure something good will come of it			2
i 'm just not sure what it is yet			0
" at the @entity31 in 1996 , @entity30 launched a controversial advertising campaign : " you do n't win silver -- you lose gold			1
" the company pulled the ads after many complained that it violated the @entity9 spirit			1
@entity4 , it seems , would agree , as she later said she was proud to bring the @entity9 medal home , albeit one of the wrong color			1
in 2008 , a tepid controversy arose regarding who had " won " the medal count -- the unofficial tallying of medals that rose to prominence during the @entity51			0
at the @entity53 , the @entity22 figured itself atop the medal count with 45 total , 14 of which were gold ; the @entity57 -- with 41 total -- put itself on top with 26 golds			2
although the @entity63 states that competitions are between individuals and teams , not countries , a medal 's worth depends on who is holding it			0
while @entity4 shed tears over her bronze , @entity71 snowboarder @entity70 expressed jubilation over hers in slopestyle			1
having won @entity79 's very first @entity9 medal in a snow sport , @entity77 could barely contain her joy over her surprise third place finish , and the mayor of her hometown , @entity85 , plans to welcome her back with a grand celebration			1
but bronzes are not just happy occasions when they are surprises			0
veteran @entity90 skier @entity89 arrived in @entity92 as the most decorated @entity22 woman in @entity95 history , 1 gold and 2 silvers , and added to that haul on her first day of competition a bronze in the @entity101			1
coming off a relatively miserable season , and always a question mark in slalom , @entity89 has been known to save her best for the most high - profile moments , exemplified by her silver in the same event in @entity109			0
her successful debut in @entity92 -- and she 's by no means done -- gives @entity89 a medal of every color -- the bronze completed her set			1
was she happy ? " i got a medal today , " she crowed afterward , looking just as ebullient as gold medalist @entity116			2
@entity89 's seasoned enthusiasm was equaled by the @entity22 figure skaters , who captured bronze in the inaugural team competition			2
with the exception of ice dancers @entity125 and @entity126 , predictions for @entity22 skaters in @entity92 have been gloomy , meaning that any medal -- bronze or otherwise -- was better than none at all			1
the opposite could be said for snowboarding legend @entity130			0
some competitors met with vitriol his decision to withdraw from slopestyle to stay healthy and focus on halfpipe			0
perhaps critics should give him a break			0
for @entity125 , it is n't about a medal of any color			2
it 's about capturing that unprecedented third gold			0
for others , of course , no medal is required : @entity148 participation at the @entity9 is victory enough			1
the majority of the athletes who march in the @entity152 will not spend time on a podium			0
we know it , and more important , they know it			0
for these athletes , the @entity159 has real meaning : " the most important thing in the @entity9 is not to win but to take part			1
" the day before @entity152 , during the moguls qualifier in which @entity4 did so well , teammate @entity164 broke her leg in a nasty spill			1
while in the ambulance , she asked her father if she was still an @entity170 , to which he replied " of course you are			0
" the next evening she made it so , getting to @entity173 in a wheelchair , and then walking , albeit on crutches , with her team during the @entity176			0
in @entity92 , @entity164 had been a serious medal contender , but in the end it was n't about competing , it was enough just to be there			1
for @entity4 , at least initially , it was n't			0
because she did n't win bronze			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity185 : " you do n't win silver , you lose gold " is the way some @entity92 competitors feel
@entity185 : while some shed tears over getting a bronze , others like @entity70 are *jublilant*
she says @entity164 broke her leg but still walked with her team as an @entity170
@entity185 : for others , no medal necessary , @entity9 spirit is not winning , but just " to take part "
