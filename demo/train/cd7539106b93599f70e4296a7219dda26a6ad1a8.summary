@entity0 -- more than a dozen @entity2 and @entity4 officials faced punishment wednesday after a long - awaited report on the botched gun probe known as " @entity8			1
" that probe and a previous investigation were marked by " a series of misguided strategies , tactics , errors in judgment and management failures " that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach @entity20 drug cartels , the @entity2 's independent inspector general concluded			1
within minutes of the report 's release , @entity2 announced rthat former acting @entity4 chief @entity23 was retiring and another official , deputy assistant attorney general @entity24 , had resigned			1
read excerpts from the report @entity24 and @entity23 were among 14 people who " bore a share of responsibility for @entity4 's knowing failure in both these operations to interdict firearms illegally destined for @entity20 , and for doing so without adequately taking into account the danger to public safety that flowed from this risky strategy , " the report states			1
@entity24 failed to pass along key information about the flawed tactics being used in @entity8 , while @entity23 and other @entity4 officials did n't properly supervise the probe , the report states			1
the report referred them and another 12 officials in @entity0 and the @entity4 and @entity48 attorney 's offices in @entity49 to @entity51 officials to determine " whether discipline or other administrative action " was required			1
@entity54 reacts to report " @entity8 " became public after guns traced to the probe turned up at the scene of a @entity59 agent 's december 2010 killing			1
the resulting investigations discovered similar tactics in a 2006 - 2007 operation dubbed " @entity8 , " also run out of @entity49			0
revelations that @entity4 agents watched suspected gun traffickers cross into @entity20 with weapons purchased at @entity48 gun shops outraged lawmakers			1
@entity69 , one of the @entity4 agents who blew the whistle on the operation , told @entity1 that it was " egregious " that agents were watching people transfer guns to people who were handing them over to the cartels , " and we were not taking an enforcement action			1
" " i would say that the persons responsible for this case ... at the field level , the division level , and the headquarters level and as far as it went into the @entity2 , should be held accountable for any decision that they made that allowed these guns to go out on the street unmonitored , " @entity69 said			0
making matters worse , the @entity2 initially denied guns were being allowed to " walk " across the border , only to have to formally retract that statement in december 2011			0
the controversy forced @entity23 out at @entity4 , but he remained in another post at @entity2 until wednesday			1
acting atf director @entity89 , meanwhile , said his agency " accepts full responsibility " for failing to oversee the @entity93 probes			2
what was ' @entity8 , ' and what went wrong ? " this hurts			0
this hurts people here , " @entity89 told reporters			0
but he added that the @entity4 has been tightening up its procedures and wo n't shy away from tough operations			1
" all we can do is get off the mat again and keep swinging , " he said			2
the controversy fueled @entity107 accusations of a cover - up by the @entity110 administration and led to an unprecedented vote to hold attorney general @entity54 in contempt of @entity113			2
the report found that @entity54 was not informed of the controversial @entity4 operation until 2011 , after @entity59 agent @entity59 was killed			1
in a written statement on the findings , @entity54 said the inspector - general 's report upholds " what i , and other @entity2 officials , have said for many months now " -- that the tactics used pre-dated the @entity110 administration and that @entity2 leaders did n't try to hide the facts from lawmakers			1
" it is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations -- accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion , " @entity54 said			0
" i hope today 's report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed			1
" the truth about the @entity8 scandal but @entity146 @entity145 sen. @entity145 , who brought @entity4 whistleblower complaints to the department 's attention in early 2011 , said the report " reaffirms virtually everything " that congressional investigators turned up			1
" it 's clear that both the @entity4 and the @entity2 failed to provide meaningful oversight of @entity8 , " @entity145 said in a written statement			1
those agencies " ignored warnings from employees " and refused to acknowledge how bad the problem was until after months of congressional pressure , he said			0
and @entity145 said the report inaccurately lets assistant attorney general @entity162 " off the hook " regarding a february 2011 letter to @entity113 that denied guns were being allowed to cross the border			2
along with the statement , @entity145 released e-mails he said contradict the report			2
@entity162 acknowledged last november he had learned that guns were allowed to " walk " to @entity20 , and apologized for not informing other senior @entity2 officials			0
the february 2011 letter to @entity145 was later retracted by @entity51 officials			0
wednesday 's report criticized @entity162 and another top official , @entity174 , who was acting deputy attorney general when the events took place , for failing to pass along information to the attorney general and other top officials			1
but they remain with the department			0
a standoff over internal justice documents erupted after the @entity110 administration said it was asserting executive privilege in the @entity8 case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes			0
that prompted the @entity193 to vote a civil contempt charge against @entity54 -- the first time a @entity2 chief has been held in contempt by @entity113			2
@entity197 protested the vote vehemently as being purely political , and the citation passed along party lines			0
the @entity193 took the issue to court , where it is expected to linger until well beyond november 's presidential election			2
by the numbers : @entity8 some of the documents the @entity206 withheld under the privilege claim were included in the report			2
@entity145 said that inclusion " proves that this subset of documents could have been released earlier , " and the president " was merely thumbing his nose at @entity113 " before the contempt vote			0
rep. @entity217 , who pushed for the contempt vote against @entity54 as chairman of the @entity220 , the report shows " widespread failures " and " a near - total disregard for public safety			0
" " attorney general @entity54 has clearly known about these unacceptable failures , yet has failed to take appropriate action for over a year and a half , " added @entity217 , @entity224			0
@entity54 had said he was awaiting the report to determine what actions to take against individuals involved in the case			0
but he has promised @entity113 that such " gun walking " of weapons into @entity20 would never again be allowed			0
@entity217 called on president @entity110 to " step up and provide accountability " for the program			0
and inspector general @entity237 , whose office produced the report , is scheduled to appear before @entity217 's committee on thursday			1
tell us what you think : share you reactions to the report			0
@entity1 's @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			2
