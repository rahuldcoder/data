-- @entity1 once said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results			0
following a third exploratory round of bilateral talks between the @entity9 and @entity10 held in @entity11 last week , @entity6 looks as though it is walking into yet another goodies - for - nuclear freeze deal with the reclusive @entity10			1
the @entity13 announced wednesday that the @entity9 would provide food aid to @entity10 in return for @entity17 's promise to implement a moratorium on long - range missile launches , nuclear tests and its plutonium and uranium enrichment activities			1
@entity10 also agreed to allow the return of inspectors from the @entity25 to verify and monitor the moratorium			1
@entity1 , if he cared about the issue , would probably roll over in his grave			0
why are we doing this ? we have seen this playbook several times before in our 25 - plus year history of trying to denuclearize @entity10			1
the @entity9 gets pulled into providing food or energy indefinitely to maintain the nuclear freeze			1
the @entity10 eventually cheat on the freeze and undertake augmentation of their nuclear weapons at other undisclosed facilities			1
we stop providing the assistance			0
a hair - raising crisis ensues that is ultimately resolved through another assistance - for - freeze agreement			0
@entity44 , rinse , repeat			0
political types might condemn it as insanity , @entity48 © or both			0
but there may be some common - sensical reasons for doing this			0
practically speaking , the achievement of a nuclear and missile - testing moratorium , as well as the reintroduction of the @entity58 nuclear - watchdog agency inspectors into @entity59 , is a useful step			1
the uranium enrichment program currently meets the definition of a runaway nuclear program			2
it has gone unabated now for at least five years , if not longer			0
getting eyes on the ground again , as in 1994 to 2002 and 2007 to 2008 , is a welcome development			0
for @entity10 , the young @entity68 may want to demonstrate a continuity of leadership after the sudden death of his father nine weeks ago , and the regime wants food in preparation for its april 15 celebrations of the 100th birthday of the first leader of @entity10 , @entity78			1
however , beyond these tactical solutions are longer - term strategic challenges			0
first , @entity10 may temporarily halt their program , but the grim reality is that it will not part with it			1
second , the @entity25 inspectors will go into the facilities without a supporting @entity88 resolution declaring that the uranium program is in violation of standing denuclearization agreements			0
) so while the @entity9 will see this move as monitoring a freeze , @entity10 will see it as validating to the international community that it only has peaceful intentions with its uranium program			1
third , it is too soon to tell whether this agreement means the @entity102 is turning over a new leaf and seeking to make nice with the world			0
fourth , the slightest opening up of this brittle dictatorship under the untested son will ensure that it comes crumbling down -- something for which the @entity9 , @entity92 and @entity109 are wholly unprepared			1
fifth , a nuclear freeze is a long way from the denuclearization objectives sought in the 2005 agreement at the so - called @entity114			2
indeed , one of the unmet @entity9 " pre-steps " for returning to the @entity114 was a commitment by the @entity118 to refrain from further provocations such as the 2010 submarining of a @entity109 navy ship and artillery shelling of a @entity109 island			2
the @entity118 made no such commitments outside of a vague reference to supporting the 1953 armistice agreement that ceased @entity128 hostilities			0
finally , nongovermental and humanitarian groups probably chafe at the explicit linking of food assistance to the nuclear freeze			2
the @entity9 would claim that the @entity118 insisted on the linkage			2
but it takes two to tango			0
secretary of state @entity135 correctly characterized the agreement as a " modest step forward			1
" this may not be insanity , but it is distasteful given the nature of the regime , its human rights violations and its blatant willingness to engage in renegade nuclear activities			2
unfortunately , that 's the price one pays when negotiating with @entity10			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 .			1

the @entity9 and @entity10 reach new deal on nuclear moratorium
@entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 : we *'ve* seen this playbook before
the *writers* say the grim reality is that the deal is a temporary move for @entity10
they say @entity135 correctly characterized the deal as a " modest step forward "
