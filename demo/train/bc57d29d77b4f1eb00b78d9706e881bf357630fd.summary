@entity0 , @entity1 -- after the @entity4 and @entity5 met at the @entity7 summit on health care , it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement			1
indeed , few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal			0
the @entity7 did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without @entity4 support			2
the choice now becomes whether @entity5 should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation			1
according to recent reports , @entity5 are considering having the @entity7 pass the bill that was already approved in the @entity22 and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation			1
programs that are considered under the reconciliation process are not subject to a @entity22 filibuster			1
democrats would only need 51 votes , not 60 , to pass those parts of the bill that are included under reconciliation			1
@entity33 was created through the @entity34 of 1974 in an effort to streamline the budget process , strengthen the ability of @entity38 to make tough decisions regarding deficits , and to make legislative decision - making more efficient			0
@entity38 quickly expanded on the types of measures that could be considered under reconciliation until 1985 and 1986 , when the @entity22 passed rules proposed by sen. @entity46 that limited what could or could not be included when using this process			1
before moving forward , @entity5 must consider two questions			2
the first is whether using reconciliation to pass health care is legitimate or an abuse of the process			1
@entity4 have charged that this would be akin to forcing the program through the chamber rather than passing the bill through negotiation and compromise			0
on this question , the answer is easy			0
@entity33 has been as much a part of the @entity22 in the past three decades as the filibuster			1
according to an article that was published in @entity65 , @entity38 passed 22 reconciliation bills between 1980 and 2008			0
many important policy changes were enacted through this process , including the @entity69 , @entity70 ( which allows people who switch jobs to keep their health care ) , student aid reform , expansions in @entity76 and several major tax cuts			2
@entity79 's @entity78 reported that most of the health care reforms enacted in the past two decades have gone through reconciliation			2
president @entity83 was one of the first presidents to make aggressive use of reconciliation when he pushed through his economic program in 1981			0
senate majority leader @entity88 said then that speed had been essential because " every day that this is delayed makes it more difficult to pass			2
this is an extraordinary proposal , and these are extraordinary times			0
" presidents @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 all used reconciliation as well			0
it is worth noting that these presidents , particularly @entity97 , also made use of sweeping executive power to circumvent @entity38 altogether			0
the second question is more difficult and it involves perceptions			0
if the @entity5 leadership wants to use this tactic , they have to convince enough members of their own party that this wo n't scare off independent voters			1
this argument was harder to make in 2009 than in 2010			0
but after a year of dealing with paralysis in the @entity22 and highly effective @entity4 obstruction , more democrats are coming on board			1
the leadership must be proactive in responding to the criticism about reconciliation			0
they will have to explain that reconciliation is a legitimate process by pointing to the history			0
they will also have to connect the dots for voters frustrated with the ineffective government by explaining that the constant use of the filibuster has turned the @entity22 into a supermajority institution where both parties have found it extraordinarily difficult -- virtually impossible -- to pass major @entity132 this point , @entity4 and @entity5 actually agree			1
indeed , as @entity5 make this decision , @entity135 @entity134 senator @entity134 is objecting to a unanimous consent order and single - handedly preventing the @entity22 from passing an important bill to assist unemployed workers			1
democrats must also convince hesitant colleagues that the payoff could be greater than the cost			0
while , in the short - term , @entity4 will complain that their opponents have rammed through social policy in some sort of unnatural procedural move , @entity5 are facing these kinds of intense attacks anyway			1
right now , democrats are receiving the brunt of @entity4 attacks without being able to pass much legislation			2
if they pass health care , they will be able to respond to the arguments of the @entity4 , not just by complaining that @entity4 obstruct everything , but by pointing to specific benefits such as lowering premiums by expanding how many people purchase coverage and bringing tens of millions of @entity163 into the health care system			1
in certain respects , the @entity7 made the use of reconciliation more difficult by initially accepting the notion that 60 votes were needed to pass legislation through the @entity22			1
after the election of sen. @entity172 , @entity173 , a decision to refocus on procedures that only depend on 51 votes makes it more vulnerable to the attacks of manipulating the process			2
but in other respects , the administration now has a better political opportunity to use reconciliation			0
after a year , the public has seen just how dysfunctional @entity22 procedures can be in an era when filibusters are common			2
with a public that is frustrated by @entity191 , as the polls show , the @entity5 might be able to persuade a sufficient number of their colleagues to go along			0
if they do n't , one thing is for certain : democrats will go into election day facing voters who are hearing all the complaints about their party but seeing very little in terms of what they can deliver on health care			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			0

democrats are considering using method to pass health bill with 50 , not 60 @entity22 votes
@entity213 says the process has been used many times in recent decades
he says @entity5 have difficult political choice of whether to move ahead
@entity206 : if they do n't , they will be on the *defensive* anyway and have no *accomplishment*
