@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 visitors pose for photos and pretend to sell each other passenger tickets next to a rusty little locomotive in a shattered corner of the @entity4 capital			1
built in @entity11 in 1923 , this little engine is all that is left of @entity13 's effort to modernize @entity1 by constructing a 7 kilometer - long railroad in downtown @entity15 in the 1920s			1
the locomotive is now a curiosity at the @entity18 , standing below the ruins of the former king 's battle - scarred palace			2
for 24 - year old @entity23 , it is the first time he has seen a train in @entity1			1
" it 's a very sad symbol , " says the university student			2
" unfortunately we do n't have a train today			0
" in fact , the first modern railroad in @entity1 in nearly a century is nearing completion in the north of the country			1
construction crews from @entity36 are putting the final touches on a brand - new , 75 - kilometer long railroad that runs from the @entity36 - @entity4 border to the northern @entity4 city of @entity41			2
an eerie metallic " whump " echoes down the rails , as service locomotives and passenger trains carrying work crews and equipment trundle up and down the track			0
" @entity1 is a land - locked country and its economic prospects depend quite a bit on connectivity with its neighbors , " says @entity49 of @entity50 , which contributed $ 165 million dollars for construction of the project			1
" if we extend the railway across northern @entity1 it will really be a shot in the arm towards @entity1 's economic prospects			1
" due to poverty , isolation and war , @entity1 skipped the age of railroads			1
@entity4 went from riding horseback to traveling by car down bone - jarring dirt roads			0
the country 's economy relies on convoys of trucks to ship goods			2
@entity49 says the new railroad will dramatically increase capacity for freight passing through @entity0 , the main shipping terminal at the @entity36 - @entity4 border			0
clusters of freshly - painted fuel depot tanks have cropped up in the sands around @entity0			0
according to the @entity50 , @entity0 is the biggest transit point in @entity1 , accepting more than 50 percent of all imports , including more then 80 percent of the country 's fuel			1
the new railroad is part of an ambitious plan to develop a new " @entity89 " trade corridor			0
@entity1 has long been economically and politically severed from its northern , former @entity91 neighbors			1
but for the past several years , the @entity92 has been promoting the construction of bridges , rail links and pipelines to the former @entity91 republics of @entity36 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
the idea is to eventually link energy - rich @entity101 to energy - hungry @entity102 through the war - torn mountains and deserts of @entity1			1
the plan has won support from another major player in the region : @entity110			0
last week , the @entity110 state mining company @entity111 ( @entity112 ) signed an agreement with the @entity4 government to develop plans to construct a much longer railroad in eastern @entity1			1
@entity112 estimates the project 's initial price tag would be between $ 6 - to $ 7 billion dollars			2
the proposed railway would run at least 700 kilometers ( 434 miles ) from the border of @entity121 to @entity15 , past the @entity123 copper mine south of @entity15			0
@entity112 won a tender in 2008 to extract copper from @entity123			0
the @entity4 government is counting on untapped mineral resources to be the main engine for economic growth in coming decades			2
but officials say new transport infrastructure will be essential for mineral extraction to succeed			2
" for the transportation of iron ore or copper you must have a railway line , " said @entity132 , @entity1 's minister of mines			1
@entity110 officials say there is another vital element before railroad construction can begin : security			2
the proposed @entity112 railroad runs right through heavily - contested @entity145 country			0
" there really exists a problem of security , " said @entity112 president @entity146 , when asked by @entity2 how he planned to protect the multi-billion dollar railroad			0
@entity146 said the security environment would be assessed after two years , when the feasibility study for the railroad is expected to be completed			0
" if the security situation is getting worse , then of course we will see and discuss with the [ @entity4 ] government how to go ahead with this investment			0
definitely the security of the investment , the safety of the investment is very important to the investor , " he added			0
representatives of @entity36 's state railway company say they have not encountered a single security incident since the company began construction of the railroad in northern @entity1 last january			1
armies of guards protect the @entity36 work crews			0
@entity4 police have erected guard posts every few kilometers along the railroad			0
@entity1 's northern @entity175 , where the railroad is located , is considered to be one of the safer parts of the country			1
and yet a deadly suicide bombing targeted a @entity182 military convoy outside the main city of @entity41 last week , killing and wounding several @entity4 civilian bystanders			0
despite the fear of possible sabotage attacks , residents of the rapidly - growing trade hub of @entity0 clearly see hope in the construction of the new railroad			2
" this connects @entity1 to the world , " says an 18 - year - old high school student named @entity193			1
he says he hopes to one day get a job as an engineer for the railroad			0
" i want trains for all the provinces of @entity1 , not just for @entity175			1
" just a few yards away , an @entity36 operator brought a construction locomotive to a squeaking halt , allowing several women dressed in billowing blue burkas to lead their children by hand over the railroad 's dusty tracks .			1

@entity1 skipped the age of railroads
a line is under construction in the north
rail lines seen crucial to extracting @entity1 's mineral *wealth*
