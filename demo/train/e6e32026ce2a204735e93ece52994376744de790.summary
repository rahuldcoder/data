-- when @entity2 stepped into the spotlight on @entity2 's 2002 debut , he was a novelty act			0
that acoustic guitar , that soothingly sweet tenor voice , that flowing mountain - man beard ? pop music had n't seen anything like it since the heyday of @entity12			0
but @entity14 's songs -- sincere folk churners full of backwoods beauty and subtle psychedelia -- had a weird magic all their own			1
since then , indie rock has been overrun by extravagantly bearded , achingly earnest balladeers , but @entity14 started running away from the pack on 2007 's " the @entity22 , " which juiced limpid melodies with dashes of @entity26 folk and @entity28 rock			0
gallery : keep up with rock 's hottest photos in @entity32 now , on " @entity40 , " @entity14 has gone pop -- at least the kind of pop you might have heard on a free - form radio station occupied by a band of hippie visionaries in 1971			1
@entity14 's lovely voice anchors melodies of crystalline clarity and unshakable catchiness			1
but the music wo n't stay still , moving from stormy psychedelic rock ( " @entity47 " ) to white - guy funk ( " @entity55 " ) to what sounds like a @entity51 version of a country - western ballad ( " @entity54 " )			0
@entity14 's tunes pull you merrily along , but his songs do n't shy from the big issues , tackling war , politics and sex			2
on " me and @entity67 , " @entity14 seems to poke fun at his own minor celebrity : " @entity68 made the local news / guess i had nowhere else to go			1
" do n't believe it : @entity14 's headed someplace , and it 's worth following			2
