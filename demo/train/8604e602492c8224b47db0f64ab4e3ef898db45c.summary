-- @entity3 terror attacks remain a significant threat within the @entity5 , homeland security secretary @entity1 said sunday , and could occur without warning			1
" we have to be vigilant against an independent actor here in the homeland who might choose to strike at any moment , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity7 in an interview at the @entity9			1
the threat posed by these potential attackers is nothing new			0
but @entity1 's concerns show how challenging counter-terrorism has become			2
just a few years ago , @entity5 officials pursued a group that followed more predictable recruitment patterns			0
" @entity23 was a relatively traditional command and control structure where someone would be recruited , they train at an overseas camp and then they 'd be sent to commit a terrorist attack , " @entity1 explained			1
" the new phenomenon that i see that i 'm very concerned about , " @entity1 continued , " is somebody who has never met another member of that terrorist organization , never trained at one of the camps , who is simply inspired by the social media -- the literature , the propaganda , the message -- to commit an act of violence in this country			1
" @entity1 added that , while the @entity5 government has largely been successful in disrupting plots hatched by terrorist cells abroad , catching individuals who are not formally connected requires them to take a different tactic -- relying heavily on state and local law enforcement			2
the @entity49 is also turning to religious and community organizations in its fight against extremism , @entity1 said			1
" i 've made this a personal part of my agenda " he said , " by traveling to a lot of community - based organizations around the country , many of them @entity60 based , and the dialogue is interesting			2
" " we have to build trust across the spectrum of issues , " he continued			0
" i do n't want to just go there and say , ' i 'm here to talk about countering violent extremism			0
what can you do to help me ? ' " crucially , said @entity1 , the government has to offer a competing message to the young men who might otherwise be drawn in by the extremist rhetoric they see online			2
this as groups like @entity77 develop increasingly sophisticated social media and propaganda arms that strive to recruit western jihadists			1
" i think that some men , some young men may be inclined to turn in that direction , " said @entity1			0
" we 're seeing that obviously and so we have to offer a counter narrative			0
we have to offer a counter vision and so we need public participation in that			0
