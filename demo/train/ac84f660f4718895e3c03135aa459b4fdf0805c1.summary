@entity1 it 's the " crippling and potentially historic " blizzard that turned out to be neither			1
" they were trying to out - drama each other , " architect @entity4 in @entity1 said tuesday , speaking of officials in the region who had warned of the coming snowstorm			1
" in hindsight , it was overkill , " said @entity11 , who was sledding with his son @entity12 on @entity1 's @entity13			1
" it 's much ado about nothing			1
" @entity19 slept in the lobby of a building , curling up near a radiator , since the restaurant he worked at closed too late monday for him to get on the subway to go home			1
" when i woke up , i expected the end of the world			1
i went outside and nothing ( had ) happened			1
what storm ? " some people in the @entity32 are concerned the government cried wolf			1
" they decided to close , " a woman named @entity38 , who works with international students in @entity40 , tweeted about her workplace			1
there " is n't a flurry to be found			1
i do n't think they 'll ever give us off again			2
" " this # @entity47 does not bode well for civilian cooperation with the terms of the next snow emergency in @entity1 , " @entity45 in @entity1 said on @entity46			1
government officials say the measures taken , including travel bans , are helpful for the quick cleanup of streets and , most importantly , are signs of erring on the side of caution			2
" better safe than sorry , " said @entity1 mayor @entity59 , who had warned monday that the storm could be one of the largest " in the history of this city			1
" instead , " it 's going to be a fast return to normalcy , " @entity59 said			1
@entity68 gov. @entity67 was asked at a news conference tuesday about suggestions that the predictions were " overblown			2
" " that would be an oversimplification , " he said , laughing			2
the eastern part of the state was heaviest hit and is still receiving " significant and continued snowfall , " he said			2
still , despite previous warnings that people might be without power for days , " by and large we 'll be back to normal for most of our state tomorrow , " @entity77 said			2
many people had stocked up on days ' worth of necessities and prepared to hunker down for what the @entity85 said could be a " raging blizzard			2
" some are now calling it all " snowperbole			2
" but @entity90 , who works at a hospital in @entity1 , said she does n't believe authorities overreacted			1
" i feel we were lucky this time , " she said			2
" i think we dodged a bullet			2
" sights and sounds of the blizzard some who forecast the weather professionally felt the need to apologize , including @entity101 , with the @entity85 in @entity102 , @entity103			2
" my deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public , " he wrote tuesday on @entity46			2
" you made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right , and we did n't			0
once again , i 'm sorry			0
" he was n't alone			0
an online collection showed several similar tweets from meteorologists , including one from @entity118 's @entity117 saying the forecast " deflated as much as @entity120 footballs			0
" many of the responses to these posts were supportive			0
" you are making a prediction about the future			0
closing roads at 11 p.m. when it snows saves lives , " @entity128 in @entity1 wrote to @entity101			1
" government officials face a tough dilemma			0
they do n't want to shut everything down , keeping children home from school and people home from work , but they also do not want to risk a disaster			0
" look at what happened in @entity145 when the city was n't prepared , " @entity141 said in a @entity143 discussion			0
he was referring to an incident a year ago this week in which people were stranded along miles and miles of icy interstates , paralyzing the metro area for more than 24 hours			0
many ultimately abandoned their cars and walked home			0
there 's some hand - wringing over the forecasting models used			0
here 's the basic idea , from @entity2 meteorologist @entity159 : " meteorologists largely depend on three major forecast models : the @entity162 ( @entity163 ) , the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) , and the @entity166 ( @entity165 )			1
meteorologists will look at all of these and , using their own expertise , local knowledge , etc. , formulate a forecast			0
in this case , the @entity162 and the @entity166 both showed 2 feet of snow or more for @entity1 , while the @entity164 ( which has just been upgraded this winter ) showed a more conservative 6 to 12 inches			1
" the @entity85 forecasters in @entity1 certainly went all in with the @entity162 and @entity166 forecasts , and all but ignored the @entity164 , without providing much room for uncertainty that should come with the @entity164 showing a vastly different solution			1
" ( in 2012 , the @entity166 " was the media - darling model for properly forecasting @entity179 to a ' t ' while the @entity164 did not , " @entity159 says			0
" now it is the opposite			0
" ) still , " the forecast was n't too far off if you look at it as a whole , " @entity159 says			0
" the heaviest snow fell across much of @entity68 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
winds have gusted up to hurricane strength , which was also in the forecast			0
" predicted storm surge flooding also came to fruition , he said			0
" but of course the headlines are going to come from @entity1 and @entity103 , where a forecast of more than 2 feet turned out to only be about half that , " @entity159 said			1
there were 2 feet of snow elsewhere , and " a miss of only 30 to 40 miles in a forecast that was first given 48 hours in advance is not that bad from a strictly forecasting perspective			0
" but from a " practical perspective , " it 's a " big miss , and has major ramifications with business disruption , wasted resources and tax dollars , etc. , " @entity159 said			0
@entity2 did note the discrepancy among forecasts monday , even as government officials were announcing closures			1
" i just got the brand new models in just a minute ago			0
and one model says for @entity1 2 inches -- not 2 feet , 2 inches			1
the other model i looked at said 27 inches , " @entity2 meteorologist @entity216 noted			1
" i hate it when models do n't agree to that extent			0
" it 's not an exact science , and it 's important for people to know that , @entity159 says			0
" as meteorologists we must convey the uncertainty associated with these forecasts			1
" opinion : weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain @entity2 's @entity231 contributed to this report from @entity1 ; @entity233 reported from @entity145 .			1

some @entity235 fear a " crying wolf " effect
" better safe than sorry , " @entity1 mayor @entity59 says
