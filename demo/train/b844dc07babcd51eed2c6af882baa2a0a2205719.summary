@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 uber - producer @entity3 is famous for his almost uncanny ability to recognize a potential hit movie			1
sixth sense : @entity4 action king @entity3 is famous for his uncanny ability to recognize a potential hit movie			1
once described as " the man with the golden gut , " @entity3 's movies have earned more than $ 15 billion in box office , fueled by a potent mix of fast - moving action , big bangs and even bigger stars			1
over the span of almost four decades , @entity4 's reigning king of action has credits including , 1980s classics " @entity21 " and " @entity22 , " high - octane action movies " @entity24 " and " @entity25 " in the 1990s , and most - famously the wildly successful " @entity26 " franchise starring @entity28			1
that " @entity31 , " @entity3 's latest movie , which stars @entity30 , has absolutely no explosions , not a car chase in sight and includes gratuitous references shopping and designer high heels should signal to everyone that chick flicks have well and truly arrived			1
" @entity46 " caught up with @entity3 to ask him about the growing power of the female cinema audience , taking risks and his ability to spot movie gold			1
@entity46 : you 're thought of as the @entity4 action king			1
do you think the fact that you 're moving into chick flicks with " @entity31 " is a sign that @entity4 is taking the female audience more seriously ? @entity3 : i think we 've always taken the female audience very seriously , but with the success of " @entity57 " and a number of other movies ... we know that there 's a big female audience out there , we just need to figure out the films that they really want to go see			1
which is hard , you do n't really know			0
hopefully , they 'd want to go and see " @entity31			1
" watch @entity3 , director @entity67 and star @entity30 talk about " @entity31 " @entity46 : how do you know that a film is going to be a hit ? with films like , " @entity26 " and " @entity21 " you resurrected genres that were dead			1
is it instinct or experience ? @entity3 : i think it 's just films that i really want to go and see			1
i really do n't know what 's going to make a picture successful			1
i know what a good drama is , and what good characters are , and that you should populate your film with good characters			0
it 's all about what audiences will be captivated by			2
i really do n't know			0
i just know what i like			0
@entity46 : you 're one of the most successful producers in @entity4			1
what does it take to be a great producer ? @entity3 : i love movies and i love making movies			1
it 's not about the money , it 's about can you make a good film ? can you entertain an audience and do you have good taste in casting and are you a good storyteller ? it 's all about story - telling			2
the better the story , the more popular the characters , the bigger your chance is of having a successful film			0
@entity46 : and how about taking risks ? do you need to take risks ? @entity3 : well , i do take enormous risks			2
making a pirate movie and movies like " @entity21 , " and " @entity117 " with @entity119 actors in it when that was n't in vogue			0
you know , i do it everyday			0
@entity46 : how does it affect you ? @entity3 : when they are a success , it makes you feel good			2
but not all films can be successes , so you 've to roll with the punches and just get back up and start all over again			0
@entity46 : how has the current economic crisis affected your work ? @entity3 : well , it affects everybody			2
you know , budgets are tighter and stocks are down a lot for companies			0
but box - office fortunately for the movie business has been up			2
advertisers are n't spending as much on tv , which is not good for television products , but movies are still cheap entertainment			0
when people ca n't go away and take vacations , they always can spend a few bucks and go to a movie			0
@entity46 : remakes of 1980s films seem to be becoming more popular -- especially horror remakes			0
any thoughts on remaking some of your old films from that era like , maybe , " @entity21 " ? @entity3 : not yet , but you never know			2
i mean " @entity21 " was one that was a one - off it 's hard to remake that or make it a different way			2
@entity46 : do you think long - form tv , shows like " @entity166 " or " @entity167 " with hour - long episodes and high production values have stolen audiences from the movies ? @entity3 : not at all			1
i think people still want to get out of their house			0
i mean you have a kitchen in your house i assume and you do go out to eat , right ? it 's the same thing			0
we have tvs in our homes and we watch television and we go on computers and if there 's something we want to see [ at the movies ] we are still going to go out because it 's an experience			0
@entity46 : and finally , i have to ask you , are there any plans with @entity28 to make another " @entity26 " ? @entity3 : yeah , we are talking about making another one			1
we have @entity28 certainly interested and we have him interested in another one of our projects called " @entity194 " so that 's two films that we hope to make with him .			0
