-- @entity1 is a tiny land of simple pleasures			1
@entity4 lived on the small island chain in the @entity6 from 1935 - 1937 and famously drank vodka martinis , extra dry with olives , inside the @entity9 , which burned down in 2006			1
" swim , eat , drink , work , read , talk , read , fish , fish , swim , drink , sleep			0
" that 's @entity1 , summed up by a character in @entity4 's novel " @entity20			1
" walking along a quiet stretch of white - sand beach , i 've come to appreciate this remote retreat of old - school fishermen , miles of mangroves and spectacular ocean views			0
the first group of islands in the @entity6 chain , @entity1 -- with the small islands of @entity32 and @entity33 at its core -- is only about 50 miles from @entity35 , but the slow - and - easy lifestyle on the historic atoll feels like a world away			1
@entity39 , the late congressman from @entity40 who embraced a self - imposed exile on @entity1 in 1967 , was known for sipping scotch and milk inside @entity44 and referring to @entity1 as a " shaggy paradise			1
" for me , @entity1 has always been a tranquil place to escape the commotion of big - city living , a sandy haven where i can sit and listen to the ocean waves gently slapping the shoreline			1
" when you look at the ocean in @entity1 you can often see a dozen different shades of blue and green , " said capt. @entity55 , an 80 - year - old world - renown fisherman , boat builder and local legend			1
@entity58 is only seven miles long and less than a mile wide , so walking and biking along the main road -- " @entity62 " -- is the best way to experience @entity1			1
with 1,600 residents in @entity1 , there are no crowds or long lines and rush - hour traffic is often just a three - golf - cart pile - up in a hotel parking lot			1
take a leisurely stroll through @entity72 , @entity1 's main settlement that dates back to 1848 , and you 'll find a cozy collection of small shops , family - owned restaurants and bars , one bank and plenty of engaging conversation			1
what you wo n't find in @entity72 are traffic lights			0
" people come to @entity1 because it 's a laid - back destination , " @entity85 , general manager of the @entity86 , said in a recent interview			1

" and , @entity85 added proudly , " @entity1 is safe			1
" i 've traveled to @entity1 many times over the years and even though swimming , eating , reading , talking and drinking consumed most of my days , exploring @entity1 's enchanting underwater world was also at the top of my to - do list			1
fifty feet beneath the sea , @entity1 offers an array of shipwrecks , shark dives , swim - through caverns and tunnels and colorful coral heads resting on the ocean floor			1
divers also come to @entity1 to explore the fascinating limestone formations that some believe to be the @entity116			1

) " the scuba diving here is great , " @entity55 said			0
" the reefs are very beautiful and many people come here to dive with dolphins			0

@entity138 also returned to @entity1 in 1968 to write the last speech he delivered , to the sanitation workers in @entity143 , before his death			1
forty - eight years ago , @entity138 wrote part of his eulogy in @entity55 ' wooden boat deep in the @entity1 mangroves , a winding swamp of thick bushes and trees where 100 species of fish and marine life fill the murky waters			1
" there was such humility about dr. @entity138 , " @entity55 recalled			2
" he enjoyed communing with nature in the mangroves			0
when he first stepped foot on this soil , i could tell there was something special about dr. @entity138 and @entity1			1
" @entity1 is known as the big - game fishing capital of the world			2
anglers have been traveling to @entity1 for decades to snare bonefish , snapper , tuna and wahoo			2
the island has become famous for its international fishing competitions and @entity6 guides , like @entity55 , are skilled tradesmen			0
even though @entity1 is still a sleepy little island , change is coming fast			2
a new casino is almost completed and expected to open sometime in 2013			0
the casino coincides with a " fast ferry " between @entity183 and @entity1 that will offer tourists an alternative to flying			2
there is only one airport serving @entity1 -- @entity188 ( @entity189 )			2
@entity191 scheduled air service is available to @entity1 from @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity183			2
where to stay i like the @entity196 and the @entity197			0
founded in 1947 , the @entity196 is situated just off the main road in @entity72			0

it 's a comfortable , clean and friendly facility within walking distance of @entity72 's restaurants and bars			0
the @entity209 is a new luxurious property that features 374 @entity212 - style hotel rooms with authentic @entity213 © cor. the resort features several upscale and inexpensive restaurants and a popular infinity pool that overlooks the ocean			0
@entity209 is not as close to @entity72 as the @entity196 , but it 's only a short ride by taxi , golf cart or bike to town			0

if you 're looking for nightlife and club - hopping , stick with @entity192 , but if it 's serenity near the ocean that sounds appealing , then you might want to consider @entity1 -- a stress - free destination for stressed - out travelers			2
as one @entity1 native once told me : " no rushing , no pressure , no heart attacks			0
" @entity254 writes about national politics for @entity256			0
he is an avid scuba diver and the author of " @entity258 , " the story of a @entity261 slave ship that sank off the coast of @entity263 , @entity183 , in 1700 and @entity254 's personal journey retracing its route and scuba diving inlets where the ship anchored .			0
