-- two californians , one of whom died , may have been exposed to mice droppings or urine that contained hantavirus while vacationing at @entity8 , health officials said thursday			1
the visitors contracted hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome , a rare but often fatal lung disease			1
the two had stayed at the popular @entity13 in mid-june , according to the @entity14			0
an unidentified 37 - year - old man from the @entity16 died in late july , said dr. @entity17 , chief of the department 's vector - borne disease section			1
a @entity22 woman in her 40s survived and is recovering , @entity20 told @entity0			1
the two stayed in separate locations at the village , which contains about 400 canvas tent and wooden cabins			1
" they are very sparse but comfortable , " @entity8 ranger and spokesman @entity29 said of the tent cabins where the man and woman stayed			1
officials have focused on deer mice , common in the high - elevation eastern @entity37 region			1
the mice are gray or brown on top , with white bellies			2
their ears have no fur			0
" rodents can infest a whole range of these structures , " @entity20 said			0
" deer mice can get in a hole one - quarter inch in diameter			1
" in the @entity53 , the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice , cotton rats , rice rats and white - footed mice , according to the @entity58			1
the virus can be present in the rodents ' urine , droppings and saliva , and is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus , the @entity58 says			0
the virus is not communicable from person to person			0
explainer : what is hantavirus ? rodent control is the primary strategy for preventing the hantavirus syndrome , according to the @entity58			2
@entity22 's health department has worked with @entity8 for years to reduce the risks to visitors , @entity20 said			1
the agency and park public health officers routinely conduct rodent surveillance , and the park inspects buildings and facilities , it said			0
the battle begins with workers routinely disinfecting floors and removing mouse droppings			0
once park officials learned of the two cases , all 400 camp structures were thoroughly cleaned , @entity29 said thursday			2
@entity8 has increased routine measures to reduce the hantavirus risk , according to officials			1
" you can not eliminate all the mice , " @entity20 said			2
" there are a lot of people and snacks that people bring into their tents or cabins			2
" @entity29 said officials consider @entity13 safe and guests have not canceled lodging reservations in the busiest month of the year at @entity8			1
officials urge people to clean areas of rodent infestation with caution			0
it 's best not to vacuum or sweep , because that can push hantavirus particles into the air , where they can enter the lungs			2
rather , people should wear gloves and use bleach where they see mouse droppings			0
they should let the bleach sit for 15 minutes before using a mop or sponge to clean up			0
opening shuttered areas to air and sunlight also is suggested			0
the two recent hantavirus cases bring the 2012 total in @entity22 to four			2
about one - third of the 60 cases reported in the state since 1993 have been fatal , the department said			0
@entity8 saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010			1
there is no specific treatment for hantavirus infection , according to the @entity58 , but the earlier the patient is brought to intensive care , the better			0
diagnosis is difficult , because early symptoms of fever , muscle aches and fatigue often are confused with the flu			0
" however , if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue , and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure , together with shortness of breath , ( that ) would be strongly suggestive of @entity153 , " the @entity58 says			0
boy drowns , another missing in @entity8 river			1

@entity158 said it disinfected 400 cabins
man , woman in june visited camping area in @entity8
they may have been exposed to *deadly* hantavirus
deer mice might be to blame
