@entity0 -- now that @entity3 is friends with @entity5 , this journalist is giving her timeline a rethink			1
i rejoiced when it launched @entity10 , as this was a chance to build a professional presence on the network separate from my personal feed			2
i was also riveted by the work of @entity16 , the @entity17 internet activist and @entity19 executive who devised the " we are all @entity22 " facebook page after a businessman who died in police custody last year			0
the page helped spark the revolution that toppled @entity17 president @entity27			0
the faces of @entity17 's " @entity29 " and i was thrilled when @entity3 hired a dedicated journalist - program manager to build ways for reporters to be more socially savvy			1
but now @entity3 will answer to its shareholders as a publicly traded company			2
to keep @entity5 happy , it will have to make more money -- quarter after quarter			0
journalists have to face up to the fact that we -- along with about 800 million @entity3 users worldwide -- are the product being sold			1
how you help @entity3 make billions reporters have invested countless hours updating their @entity3 feeds			2
take a look at @entity48 's @entity47 who joined @entity3 in 2008			1
she regularly posts updates on big international stories			0
in recent days , she 's been quoting @entity51 and photos of her commuting life in @entity54			2
she currently has more than 519,000 subscribers			0
and then there 's me with a @entity3 page that deserves to stay in the archives as i stubbornly refuse to add a subscribe button			1
i post daily about works of journalism that have caught my eye to a small but valued audience			0
timeline : @entity67 's rise from child prodigy to @entity3 billionaire by contrast , @entity1 has been embraced by the @entity3 community in a big way			1
with more than 3.5 million fans , the network 's @entity3 page is one of the world 's most popular news brands			1
but is @entity3 an essential tool for journalists ? when @entity3 wakes up to a new reality as a publicly traded company on friday , journalists will have to ask : " why are we here ? " i use social media to do three things : find out what stories matter to people around the world , interact and tune in with my viewers , and cover newsmakers who are increasingly getting social			1
i turn to @entity94 for real - time information , especially during breaking news			0
i turn to @entity97 for thoughtful conversation around stories i share			0
infographic : how we use @entity3 as for @entity3 , i believe its strength can be summed up in the marketing jargon that makes me squirm : " personal branding			2
" it feels like a fan convention			0
my fans are more interested in a photo of me posing with a light saber on @entity108 than a fresh link to a developing story out of @entity111			1
i 've worked hard to cultivate a more sophisticated level of discourse on @entity3 , which is something established reporters like @entity116 have been able to achieve with great success			2
but my @entity3 page remains a fan zone , and i 've come to the conclusion that @entity3 is a social tool for engagement and not journalism			1
@entity3 is all about consumer engagement -- the engagement of nearly a billion consumers			1
that 's why advertisers ca n't ignore it			0
and here 's where it cuts to the heart of my profession			0
journalists have been flocking to @entity3 to create content and connections on a platform that the company can use for all time			2
not only that , we 're feeding an advertising rival that 's only going to get bigger after friday 's ipo			0
i 'm not quite convinced that @entity3 is a must - buy for journalism			1
after the ipo , i may be holding on to my account , but i 'll be holding off on any extra contributions to the site .			0

@entity3 set to go public this week with a *multi-billion* *dollar* @entity149 ( @entity149 )

@entity154 : @entity3 has become a social tool for engagement and not journalism
