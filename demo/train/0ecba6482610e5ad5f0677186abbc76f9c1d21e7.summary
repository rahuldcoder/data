-- the deadliest @entity2 outbreak in history continues to plague @entity4 as leaders scramble to stop the virus from spreading			1
over the weekend , @entity8 president @entity7 closed most of the country 's borders			1
the few points of entry that are still open will have @entity2 testing centers and will implement preventive measures , she said			1
the president also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels , restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five - minute video on @entity2 safety			1
" no doubt the ebola virus is a national health problem , " @entity7 said			0
" it attacks our way of life , with serious economic and social consequences			0
as such we are compelled to bring the totality of our national resolve to fight this scourge			0
" as of july 20 , the @entity32 had confirmed 224 cases of @entity2 in @entity8 , including 127 deaths			1
overall , @entity2 has killed at least 660 people in @entity4			1
there were 45 new cases reported in the region between july 18 and july 20			0
ebola : fast facts health officials are worried about the virus spreading to other countries in the region			2
this is the first such outbreak to hit @entity4			2
on friday , a @entity8 man with @entity2 died in @entity49 , @entity47 , @entity47 health minister @entity46 said			1
@entity50 arrived at @entity49 ' airport on july 20 and was isolated at a local hospital after exhibiting common @entity2 symptoms			1
he told officials he had no direct contact with anyone who had the virus			0
@entity59 commissioner dr. @entity58 said authorities are working to identify people who may have come in contact with the man on his flights			0
the process has been delayed , he said , because the airline has not provided the passenger lists for all three of the flights @entity50 took			0
@entity50 flew first to @entity69 before he went to @entity70 and then switched planes to fly to @entity47 , according to the health commissioner			0
" in collaboration with the @entity74 , i 've also put into motion mechanisms to track down all contacts at high risk , " @entity58 said			0
the state department has identified 59 people so far who came into contact with the man			0
twenty have been tested for @entity2			1
on monday , @entity81 , one of @entity47 's biggest airlines , suspended operations into the country 's capital , @entity87 , and another city called @entity89 , according to @entity90			0
it is unlikely the virus would spread on a plane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person 's bodily fluids , according to the @entity98			0
meanwhile , @entity100 health care workers helping to fight this deadly disease abroad have put themselves at risk			2
dr. @entity103 , a 33 - year - old @entity104 resident , had been treating @entity2 patients in @entity87 when he started to feel sick			1
@entity103 works with @entity106 , a @entity107 international relief agency founded by evangelists @entity108 and @entity110			0
he has been the medical director for the @entity111 in @entity87 and has been working to help @entity2 patients since october			1
deadliest ever outbreak : what you need to know " when the @entity2 outbreak hit , he took on responsibilities with our @entity2 direct clinical treatment response , but he was serving in a missionary hospital in @entity8 prior to his work with @entity2 patients , " said @entity115 , a spokeswoman for the organization			1
after testing positive for @entity2 , he went into treatment at a @entity106 isolation center at @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity87			1
his condition is rapidly deteriorating and @entity106 has been working to evacuate him for better care , but @entity8 is not allowing the evacuation , according to @entity106 vice president of international relief , @entity130			1
the reason for the delay is unclear			0
the @entity98 said the doctor 's family had been with him , but left for the @entity100 before he became symptomatic ; as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him			2
out of an abundance of caution they are on a 21 - day fever watch , the @entity98 said			0
another @entity100 working with @entity106 has also been infected			2
@entity143 from @entity144 , @entity145 , works with @entity146 , or @entity146			0
she and her husband used to work with orphans and other children who struggle with poverty - related issues but expanded their efforts to take on the complex medical problems in @entity87			0
she had teamed up with the staff from @entity106 to help fight the @entity2 outbreak in @entity87 when she got sick			1
she , too , is undergoing treatment			0
a spokesperson for @entity106 said there have been riots outside the clinic			0
another doctor who has played a key role in fighting the outbreak in @entity163 , dr. sheik @entity164 , is sick			1
he is being treated by the @entity166 aid group @entity165 -- also known as @entity165 -- in @entity167 , @entity163 , according to a representative of that agency			2
@entity164 had been overseeing treatment of @entity2 patients in isolation units at @entity173 , which is about 185 miles ( 298 kilometers ) east of the capital , @entity89			1
@entity163 's minister of health and sanitation called the doctor a national hero for the sacrifices he has made in trying to stop the outbreak			1
doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected			2
it can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person 's bodily fluids			2
the disease is not contagious until symptoms appear			2
symptoms of @entity2 include fever , fatigue and headaches			1
they can appear two to 21 days after infection , meaning many who are sick do n't know it			0
the early symptoms then can progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function , and sometimes internal and external bleeding			0
leaders in the international health community characterize the @entity2 epidemic as the " deadliest ever			1
" while the @entity32 has mobilized to fight the epidemic , it can be a difficult one to stop			2
it is so highly infectious that it typically kills 90 % of those who catch it			0
the death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly 60 % since it has been treated early in many cases			2
there is , however , no @entity2 vaccination			1
is it time to test experimental vaccines ? with the announcement that @entity8 is closing its borders , the country also instituted a new travel policy to inspect and test all outgoing and incoming passengers			1
the hope is that such measures will stop the spread of the virus			2
there has never been a confirmed case of @entity2 spreading to a developed country , said @entity234 , an epidemiologist with @entity165			1
" this is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick , have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations , they do n't travel			0
" and even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country , they will be in a good hospital with good infection control , so they are very unlikely to infect others , " she said			0
" this is not the great plague , " @entity0 's dr. @entity246 said after his trip to the region in the spring			0
" but it is a pretty formidable killer			0
" " the grim reality is it often kills so quickly , people do n't have time to spread it			0
" the @entity98 held a media briefing monday to emphasize the fact that there is " no significant risk in the @entity100 " for an @entity2 outbreak			1
@entity98 officials said with the spread of @entity2 to @entity100 health care workers , there is a real need for " vigilance " to make sure workers are careful , get tested if there is any suspicion of illness , and that all sick travelers should remain isolated when returning from areas affected directly by the epidemic			1
@entity272 , @entity98 's deputy director of the @entity273 , said the @entity98 is working with @entity100 health care providers to educate them about @entity2			1
the agency sent a notice monday to remind doctors to take important steps to avoid the spread of the illness , including asking their patients about their travel history , particularly if they have traveled to @entity4 in the last three weeks			2
