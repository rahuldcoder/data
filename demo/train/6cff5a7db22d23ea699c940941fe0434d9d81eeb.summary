in remarks to a @entity6 meeting broadcast on @entity1 state tv , @entity0 said he did not want to see the situation escalate and urged @entity1 to show " wisdom			1
" @entity0 's abduction from a luxury hotel early thursday highlighted the security threat posed by militias that have run rampant in @entity1 since the revolution that ousted @entity15 two years ago			1
" these types of groups exploit these types of gaps that exist in the country at the moment , given the fact that we are in the process of building our criminal justice system , " @entity1 foreign minister @entity16 told @entity18 's @entity17			1

gunmen move in before dawn the gunmen took @entity0 before dawn from the @entity52 in @entity53 and put him into a convoy of waiting cars , according to a hotel clerk who was not authorized to speak to the media			0
the five - star hotel that @entity0 calls home is popular among government officials , some of whom reside there , including the justice minister			2
the witness reported no gunfire during the incident and said the gunmen were respectful and " caused no trouble			0
" @entity0 's office initially called the abduction a " rumor " on its official @entity77 page , but later posted an update that it was " coerced by kidnappers to deny the report			2
" his spokesman told @entity18 that the prime minister was kidnapped			1
but the @entity80 of @entity1 's @entity81 , the militia that took him , said it merely detained him over financial and administrative corruption charges			1
however , the @entity84 said there was no arrest warrant for @entity0 , calling the move a kidnapping			0
@entity38 said the government was not aware of the charges and the prime minister was prepared to answer any questions			1
the militia works with the @entity94 -- a not altogether uncommon practice in @entity1 , which has tried unsuccessfully to rein in the many militia groups			2

@entity104 secretary of state @entity103 , on a visit to @entity102 , said he had spoken with @entity104 ambassador to @entity1 @entity106 and @entity107 as the situation in @entity1 evolved , and would stay in close touch			1

" we are trying to create a state , and we are not ashamed of that , " he told @entity18 's @entity17			0
" the outside world believes that @entity1 is failing , but @entity1 was destroyed by @entity15 for 42 years , and was destroyed by a full year of civil war			0
and that 's why we are trying to rebuild it			0
" part of @entity1 's rebuilding involves reconciliation and accountability , @entity0 said last month			1
@entity1 has an interim president , but the prime minister holds all executive powers			1
security an issue armed militias have roamed the country largely unchecked since the 2011 ouster of @entity15			0
" we are starting from scratch , and i think it will take time , " said @entity16 , the foreign minister			1
" as long as we have a sustained support on the part of the international community , i think @entity1 will make it			0
" rights groups have said security remains a principal concern in @entity1			2
" the main problem affecting both justice and security is that armed militias still maintain the upper hand , " @entity176 said in a report last month			0
" they have various agendas -- financial , territorial , political , religious -- and operate with impunity two years after the @entity15 regime ended			0
successive interim governments have failed to assert control over these militias , preferring to contract them as parallel forces to the army and police			0
" in a statement issued thursday , the rights group said it was " deeply troubled " by @entity0 's detention , which it described as a clear violation of @entity1 law			1
" the incident highlights the grave security conditions in @entity1 today			2

@entity104 operation on saturday , @entity104 forces swooped into @entity53 and seized a @entity1 national indicted in the @entity227 bombings in @entity228			1
@entity229 is a suspect in the embassy attacks in @entity231 and @entity232 , and @entity104 officials have described him as " one of the world 's most wanted terrorists			2
" the militia group said the prime minister 's capture had nothing to do with the arrest of @entity229			1
however , three days ago , it issued a warning that whoever collaborated with " foreign intelligence services " in the arrest of the terror suspect would be punished			0
it 's unclear if @entity0 played a role in the arrest of @entity229 by @entity104 forces			1
but the @entity1 government has decried the arrest of the terror suspect , and its national congress tuesday demanded that the @entity104 hand him over			2
the foreign minister , @entity16 , denied that @entity0 's abduction had anything to do with the @entity104 operation			1
" i do n't really see the relevance of this abduction to that what happened , " he said , " because the debate in relation to the disagreements between some of the military groups and the government officials -- it was there for some time			0
