@entity6 , i 'm talking to you ! daring to flash your lady parts in front of great big sign that reads " feminist ? " what are you thinking ? queen @entity12 , do n't you realize your racy lyrics and dirty dancing are emasculating a whole generation of young men , promoting lesbianism ( so implies @entity19 , @entity21 contributor ) , and celebrating " gangsta culture " that causes the collapse of black families			1
@entity25 -- that is , wants - to @entity27 @entity25 -- spelled it out in his book , " @entity30 , @entity31			1

she has an exceptional set of pipes and can actually sing			0
she is a terrific dancer -- without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom			0
@entity39 is a very shrewd businessman , but i wonder : does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object ? " yes , @entity12 , your hubby , @entity39 , is " pimping you out			0

she told me , in a fabulously spirited way , that some people bash @entity6 because she sends out the " scariest " message possible : " feminism is cool			1
" yeah , @entity63 , feminists might be cool , but you might not realize they can also project evil on unsuspecting victims			2
