@entity0 -- @entity2 on tuesday vehemently denied all sexual harassment allegations against him and said he had no memory of the first accuser to publicly describe claimed misconduct by the @entity9 presidential hopeful			1
" they simply did n't happen			0
they simply did not happen , " @entity2 insisted of the accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior , and at least one incident of alleged sexual groping , when he was head of the @entity15 from 1996 to 1999			1
but @entity17 , one of the women who have made allegations , told @entity1 tuesday night that @entity2 is a " serial denier			1
" while declining to comment on @entity2 's tuesday remarks , @entity17 said she wanted to meet with the other accusers about their cases			1
at a news conference he held to respond to the latest accusation , made monday by @entity26 , a @entity27 woman who once worked at the restaurant group , @entity2 described her as a " troubled " woman put up to making false allegations by forces trying to derail his presidential bid			1
@entity2 said it could be the " @entity35 machine " behind the allegations but added that he did n't know for sure			1
he also said he expected further attempts to smear his name and reputation and vowed that he would not be deterred			0
" as far as these accusations causing me to back off and maybe withdraw from this presidential primary race ? @entity42 n't going to happen , " @entity2 said			1
in an earlier interview with @entity44 , @entity2 responded " yes " when asked whether @entity26 was lying when she said at a news conference monday that @entity2 made an unwanted sexual advance in 1997			1
saying he did n't remember @entity26 or the alleged incident , @entity2 added , " i have absolutely not acted inappropriately with this woman or anyone else in my entire life			1
" the latest twist came as more details emerged involving two other former employees at the restaurant association who received payouts and left their jobs , reportedly after accusing @entity2 of inappropriate behavior			2
news reports identified one of the woman as @entity17 , director of communications at a bureau within the @entity64 who worked at the restaurant association from 1998 - 99			2
@entity17 's lawyer , @entity67 , said tuesday that she complained of " multiple incidents over multiple days " in 1999 " that constituted sexual harassment			1
" in addition , @entity67 challenged @entity2 's contention that he was unable to remember what @entity17 had accused him of doing 12 years earlier			1
the restaurant association said at the time that it investigated the accusations and @entity2 denied them , @entity67 noted			1
at the news conference , @entity2 said the only complaint he could recall regarding @entity17 involved a comment he made that she was about the same height as his wife , as he held his hand up to his chin			1
he said @entity17 's complaints had been found to be baseless at the time , and the restaurant association negotiated a severance agreement with her rather than a legal settlement regarding any sexual harassment charges			1
@entity17 told @entity1 chief political analyst @entity90 that the height remark was not the basis for her complaint			1
and , @entity17 told @entity1 , she received a $ 46,000 sexual harassment settlement , rather than a severance agreement			1
@entity17 said she would like to organize a joint press conference some time in the near future with some of the other women			2
" there is safety in numbers , " she said			0
" it is important that it happen in one conference			0
" @entity67 told @entity1 that @entity105 and @entity26 have agreed to participate			2
@entity2 was introduced at the news conference by @entity108 attorney @entity107 , who said the candidate is having to respond to hearsay , not admissible evidence , in the " court of public opinion			2
" " he comes before you today to defend his reputation , " said @entity107 , who represented vindicated @entity114 bombing suspect @entity113 and @entity115 and @entity116 , parents of child murder victim @entity118			0
" a reputation that he has built over 40 years of being a good and decent man and a successful business person			0
i ask you at least afford him fairness			0
" meanwhile , a longtime friend of one of @entity2 's unidentified accusers said tuesday that @entity2 mentioned a possible job promotion at the same time he made the accuser uncomfortable with sexual innuendo and overtures			1
the woman , who spoke on condition of not being identified , said she spoke extensively with her friend about @entity2 's conduct in 1998 at the time the accuser was allegedly being harassed by @entity2 while both worked at the restaurant association			1
according to the woman , the accuser worked in government relations for the restaurant association in 1998 and told her it was well - known that @entity2 behaved badly			1
@entity26 said earlier tuesday that a reason she came forward with her account of @entity2 's alleged misbehavior 14 years after the fact was encouragement from her 13 - year - old son			1
" he said , ' @entity150 , i think you need to do the right thing			0
i think you need to tell on him , ' " @entity26 said on @entity1 's " @entity153			1
" " that confirmed it for me			0
if my son is saying it , i want to be the role model for him and other kids growing up			0
" @entity26 's story was the first public , detailed account of alleged misbehavior by @entity2			2
she alleged that @entity2 groped her following a dinner in 1997 , shortly after she was laid off by the restaurant association			2
@entity2 unexpectedly put his hand on her leg beneath her skirt and reached for her genitals and pushed her head toward his crotch after a dinner at which she sought his help finding a job , she said			2
@entity26 said @entity2 told her , " you want a job , right ? " but stopped when she protested			0
i looked up to him			0
and it just was shocking to me that he would use that power in such a way , " @entity26 said			0
she did n't file a complaint at the time because she no longer worked for the association , said @entity26 , who also denied wanting any money for going public , despite a bankruptcy stemming from costs related to her late mother 's medical bills			2
@entity2 vigorously dismissed the claims in an appearance on @entity44 's " @entity191 " monday night			2
" the feelings that you have when you know that all of this is totally fabricated : you go from anger , then you get disgusted , " he told @entity196			0
" there 's not an ounce of truth in all of these accusations			0
" in a written statement , campaign spokesman @entity202 said there was " no record , nor even a complaint filed " to support @entity26 's accusation			2
@entity26 's bombshell came as @entity2 was in his second week of battling the sexual harassment allegations that have overwhelmed his front - running campaign for the @entity9 presidential nomination			1
@entity2 has come from far back to join former @entity213 gov. @entity212 atop the polls , and his campaign said it raised $ 2 million in the week since the sexual harassment accusations first surfaced in an october 30 report by @entity218			1
by comparison , the campaign raised $ 2.8 million in the three - month quarter from june through october			0
however , @entity222 sen. @entity222 of @entity223 said tuesday that @entity2 should quit the race if the allegations against him are true			1
" it takes incredible courage for an individual to come forward , " as @entity26 has done , @entity222 said			0
" so it does cause me to wonder exactly what is out there			0
" @entity105 : a girl 's best friend @entity26 's fiance , @entity234 , backed her up in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity236			2
" this is n't for fun			0
you do n't go on a political stage and make these kinds of press conferences unless you really stand by your convictions , " he said			0
" there was no money motive to this			0
she 's got the same political interests as @entity2 in terms of party , so it was n't like there was opposing political gain here at all			1
" in denying all the allegations , @entity2 said tuesday that he still has the support of his wife of more than 40 years			2
" she knows that 's not something i would do , " he said			0
@entity2 , a favorite of tea party conservatives , has risen to the top of the polls after strong performances in several debates and the release of his " 9 - 9 - 9 " tax plan , which sets flat 9 % rates for corporate and income taxes and creates a 9 % national sales tax			0
he has complained that the sexual harassment allegations amount to a baseless media onslaught against his campaign			1
several unaffiliated @entity9 operatives said @entity2 must say more about the allegations , because his current message is not putting the controversy to rest			2
" he needs to be upfront , forthright and get this story behind him , " said @entity281 , a leading @entity282 @entity9 activist			0
the ongoing allegations , he adds , are a " test of @entity2 's leadership " and " a tipping point for his campaign			1
" @entity2 will be in @entity282 on november 19 for an event sponsored by @entity289 called the @entity290			0
an expected 2,500 potential caucus - goers will be in attendance , and @entity2 will probably have to address the issue in some form			0
" you can not let this dominate the campaign , " @entity281 said , a sentiment echoed by other analysts			0
he said @entity2 can " approach this with humility and sincerity " and people will listen			0
" @entity105 said her client is a registered @entity9 and described @entity2 's behavior at the time to her then - boyfriend and a longtime mentor			1
both have given sworn statements supporting her account , @entity105 said			0
she told @entity1 tuesday that @entity2 and the women should testify under oath			1
