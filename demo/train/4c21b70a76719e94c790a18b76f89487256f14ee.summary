-- @entity2 's defence of their @entity4 crown got off to an uncertain start as @entity7 's side had to come from behind in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity9			1
the @entity11 holders lost their opening game in @entity13 two years ago against @entity14 and when @entity15 gave @entity9 a second - half lead another upset threatened			1
@entity17 quickly equalised but sunday 's game in @entity19 provided evidence that the winners of @entity22 have work to do if they are to become the first team to win three successive major international tournaments			0
@entity2 next face @entity27 on thursday , and the @entity29 lie bottom of @entity30 after a 3 - 1 defeat at the hands of an impressive @entity33 in @entity34			1
striker @entity35 scored twice with headers , either side of a @entity39 goal for @entity33 , and @entity41 's side now lead the group with @entity43 facing an uphill battle to qualify for the quarter - finals			1
@entity2 1 - 1 @entity9 @entity2 coach @entity7 chose not to play a recognised forward preferring to pack his team with creative midfielders -- much like @entity48 -- with the likes of @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 breaking quickly from midfield			1
if this formation allowed @entity2 plenty of possession it was also a tactical set - up that was relatively vwell contained by @entity9 's organisation			1
@entity50 tested @entity59 with an early shot and later in the first half went close as he tried to lob the @entity64 goalkeeper , while @entity65 well timed tackle prevented @entity17 from testing @entity59			0
not that @entity9 were solely content to sit back and soak up @entity2 's attacks - far from it -- and @entity67 was probably the busier of the two goalkeepers			1
in the opening half the @entity70 goalkeeper stopped two shots from @entity73 , as well as an @entity75 free - kick , though the pick of the @entity79 keepers 's saves came just before the interval when he reacted quickly to push away @entity82 's goalbound header			0
early in the second half @entity83 should have given @entity9 the lead following a mistake by @entity87 but the @entity89 striker dawdled allowing the @entity79 defender to retrieve the ball			2
almost immediately @entity9 coach @entity92 withdrew @entity83 , replacing him with @entity15			2
within three minutes the switch produced immediate results as @entity75 sent @entity15 clear with the @entity95 forward curling the ball past @entity67			0
@entity9 's goal provoked an equally swift response from the defending champions as @entity51 's flick flummoxed the @entity64 defence allowing @entity17 to sweep the ball past @entity59			1
finally @entity7 decided it was time to bring on a foward , introducing @entity105 , who probably should have done better when he was sent clear by @entity107 ' pass			0
soon afterwards @entity105 was sent clear for a second time but his attempted lob went over the bar			0
@entity33 3 - 1 @entity27 sunday 's second @entity30 contest was supposed to take second billing , but in torrential rain in @entity34 the @entity113 laid down a marker for the tournament with a clinical display against the @entity27			1
it had been 10 years since the @entity29 last qualified for a major tournament and their noisy fans seemed keen to make up for lost time , but with less than three minutes gone they were silenced by a @entity33 goal			0
@entity43 's marking went missing as @entity35 was given all the time in the world to head @entity124 's deflected right - wing cross into the net , with @entity29 keeper @entity127 struggling to get across his line			0
the goal temporarily stunned @entity43 but they always carried a threat from set - pieces which eventually brought them an equaliser			0
@entity135 's wickedly inswinging free - kick from the left caught @entity137 cold at the back post , as @entity139 sneaked in to head past @entity33 keeper @entity141			0
it was the @entity113 ' turn to look rattled but the game was opening up beautifully as both teams saw the value in going for victory and three vital points with matches against holders @entity2 and @entity9 still to come			2
@entity33 coach @entity41 leaves his post after the tournament after a successful six - year spell in charge and three minutes before half - time , he saw his team take a lead that this time they would not relinquish			2
more sloppy @entity43 defending led to @entity157 slicing a clearance straight into the path of @entity39 , and as he showed last season at @entity162 , the striker is a deadly finisher inside the penalty area as he clipped calmly over given			0
soon after half - time it was all over as a lightning - quick @entity33 break led to @entity35 's header coming back off the post , hitting given on the back of his head and -- unfortunately for the @entity43 goalkeeper -- rolling into the net , though the @entity174 forward was given the goal			2
@entity43 tried hard to find a way back into the match and @entity178 had an appeal for a penalty turned down , but @entity33 were too strong and held on with ease to move top of @entity30 ahead of a meeting with @entity9 in @entity34 on thursday .			1

defending @entity186 champions @entity2 draw 1 - 1 with @entity9
@entity15 gives @entity9 the lead , before @entity17 equalises
@entity33 move top of @entity30 after a 3 - 1 win over the @entity27
@entity33 striker @entity35 scored twice with headers
