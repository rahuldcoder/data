@entity0 apologized tuesday for comparing president @entity1 to @entity2 , a remark that prompted controversy and resulted in " @entity5 " pulling his popular musical introduction from this week 's game			1
his statement tuesday went beyond his monday statement , in which he said " my analogy was extreme -- but it was to make a point			0
" on tuesday , the country singer stated : " i have always been very passionate about politics and sports and this time it got the best or worst of me			1
" the thought of the leaders of both parties jukin ' [ sic ] and high fiven ' [ sic ] on a golf course , while so many families are struggling to get by , simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement , and i am very sorry if it offended anyone			0
i would like to thank all my supporters			0
this was not written by some publicist , " @entity0 wrote			2
@entity0 made the comparison on @entity29 this week when he was asked about @entity1 and @entity31 speaker @entity30 , a @entity32 , playing on the same team in a june golf game			1
earlier tuesday , the @entity35 condemned @entity0 ' comments and praised @entity37 for pulling his " @entity38 ? " musical recording that opens " @entity5			1
" " the @entity42 was a singular event in human history , and it is an insult to the memory of the millions who died as a result of @entity2 's plan of mass extermination to compare the @entity50 dictator to any @entity52 president , " said @entity40 , @entity35 national director and a @entity42 survivor			1
" @entity0 should know better			2
he owes an apology to @entity42 survivors , their families , and the brave @entity52 soldiers who gave of themselves to fight the @entity50 menace during @entity59 the last thing we need is to enter another election cycle on a sour note tainted with inappropriate , tired and over-the - top analogies to the @entity65 , " he said			1
" @entity37 responded appropriately and did the right thing in pulling the @entity0 football song from the airwaves , " @entity40 said			1
on tuesday , @entity37 said it had made no decision on @entity0 ' future beyond the monday night telecast , according to @entity72 , senior director of communications at @entity37			1
@entity0 has criticized @entity1 in the past , when the @entity73 was running for the presidency			1
in 2008 , @entity0 was even mentioned in some media outlets as saying he was considering running for the @entity76 as a @entity32 in the next election cycle , but those plans never materialized			2
@entity0 , who supported the @entity32 ticket in 2008 and even penned a song called " @entity81 , " said during that campaign that candidate @entity1 did n't like the national anthem			1
the " @entity81 " song , which is a riff on the @entity0 tune " @entity86 , " included a line suggesting that @entity1 has " terrorist friends			1
" the day before voting in the 2008 election , @entity0 said : " you know , i 'm usually at @entity5 tonight , but @entity91 , this is a lot more important tonight			2
join me now in our national -- you know , that song that , uh , mr. @entity1 's not real crazy about , we 're singing it right now			2
" @entity0 then performed his version of the anthem			2
in an appearance on @entity29 ' " @entity100 " on monday morning , @entity0 referred to a june golf game with @entity1 and @entity31 speaker @entity30 on the same team , against vice president @entity103 and @entity105 gov. @entity104 , as " one of the biggest political mistakes ever			1
" asked what he did n't like about it , @entity0 said , " come on , come on			2
that 'd be like @entity2 playing golf with ( @entity114 prime minister @entity113 ) @entity112			2
" when one of the @entity29 interviewers later pointed out that @entity0 invoked " one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe ... the president , " @entity0 responded : " that is true , but i 'm telling you like it is , you know			1
that just was n't a good thing			0
it just did n't fly			0
so anyway , like @entity128 said , you do n't want to ask me a question because i 'm going to give you too straight of an answer			0
so talk about something else			0
" @entity128 , an actor and @entity134 commentator , was a @entity32 senator from @entity135 and one - time candidate for the @entity32 presidential nomination			0
in a statement monday , @entity37 said that while @entity0 " is not an @entity37 employee , we recognize that he is closely linked to our company through the open to ' @entity5			1
' we are extremely disappointed with his comments and as a result we have decided to pull the open from tonight 's telecast			0
" in a statement issued through a representative , @entity0 , son of legendary country singer @entity0 , acknowledged his analogy was " extreme -- but it was to make a point			1
" " some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood , " the country singer said			1
" ... i was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me -- how ludicrous that pairing was			0
they 're polar opposites , and it made no sense			0
they do n't see eye - to - eye and never will			0
" @entity0 , however , said he has " always respected the office of the president			0
" still , he noted , " every time the media brings up the tea party , it 's painted as racist and extremists -- but there 's never a backlash , no outrage to those comparisons			0
... working - class people are hurting -- and it does n't seem like anybody cares			0
when both sides are high - fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job -- it makes a whole lot of us angry			0
the policies have to change			0
" in @entity183 , the @entity182 said the controversy wo n't affect its ongoing exhibit of " family tradition : the @entity187 , " a 5,000 - square - foot display about @entity0 and his family , including his father , an iconic country singer himself , spokeswoman @entity191 said			1
in 2009 , the museum extended the exhibit through the end of 2011 , citing " overwhelming positive response , " spokesmen said .			0

" i am very sorry if it offended anyone , " @entity0 says of his comparison
earlier , the @entity35 said @entity0 owed @entity42 survivors an apology
@entity37 has yet to decide on future uses of @entity0 ' " @entity38 ? "
