@entity0 , @entity1 -- dr. @entity3 and dr. @entity4 were quickly jolted from the most modern of medical care in @entity7 , @entity8 , to the most rudimentary of care when they flew to @entity1 last week to work at a hospital housed in two tents run by the @entity13			1
the doctors , who worked at the @entity15 , quickly learned that when you have no technology -- not even the simplest blood test -- you have to make medical decisions in an entirely different way			1
the first death they witnessed taught them a valuable lesson			1
the patient was a boy who needed his leg amputated or else he would die of either an infection or rhabdomyolysis , a kidney disease that follows injuries where muscles are crushed			2
find loved ones in @entity1 share your story @entity3 , @entity33 and the other doctors had nowhere to take the boy			1
their own hospital had yet to open its operating room , so they spent hours trying to find a hospital that could do surgeries			1
their search was in vain			2
finally , the doctors decided to do the surgery themselves that night by the moonlight under a mango tree			1
" we just sawed his foot off			2
we did n't have to use anesthesia because he was already unconscious and was n't feeling a thing , " @entity3 says			2
but they 'd waited too long			2
the boy took his last breath during the surgery			2
" some of the doctors cried , " @entity3 says			1
" i told them , ' there is no crying in medicine			0
' " as a direct result of the boy 's death , a few hours later , at 3 in the morning , the surgeons at the @entity13 hospital decided to build their own operating room			1
they had no surgical lights , no oxygen , no blood , no ventilators and no monitors			1
for a tourniquet they used one of the doctor 's belts			0
" we 'd been waiting to build the operating room until we received better equipment , but after that boy 's death we became more aggressive			1
we said let 's do it , because they 're going to die anyway , " @entity3 says			0
the doctors continued to learn lessons about what one had called " civil war medicine " after the operating room went up			1
at one point , a 16 - year - old boy needed an amputation , but the surgeons asked @entity3 and @entity33 to make sure the boy 's kidneys were working before they put him through surgery			1
without any blood tests to assess kidney function , the only thing they could look for was urine as a sign that his kidneys were working			1
" we tried to see if we could get some urine going , but there was not a drop			0
we filled him with fluids and gave him @entity110 , a diuretic , to get him to pee , but nothing , " @entity3 says			0
the boy died as the doctors were treating him			2
" i saw a lot of deaths there , but this one hit me the hardest , " he says			0
" i texted my wife back at home , ' i 've had a bad day			0
' " after that boy 's death , surgeons were quicker to give permission to amputate , @entity3 says			1
@entity3 says if there 's any silver lining to practicing such rudimentary medicine , it 's that it made him a more humble doctor			0
" back in @entity7 , i 'm a hot shot			0
the nurses have to respect me , " @entity3 says			0
" here , i 'm just a worker bee			0
i cleaned the or floor after surgery			0
i carried dead bodies down the street			0
i was in traffic carrying dead bodies			0
i came here a very fancy doctor , and i 'm leaving here as a humble man			0

doctors arriving in @entity1 learn there is no technology , no basic equipment
doctors created operating room with no surgical lights , oxygen , blood or ventilators
after witnessing death of children , surgeons quicker to give permission to amputate
