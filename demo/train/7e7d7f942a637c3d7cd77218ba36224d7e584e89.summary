-- @entity2 will not send @entity4 - winning filmmaker @entity3 to the @entity5 to face sentencing for child sex charges , the @entity1 announced monday			1
he is now free , the ministry said			2
@entity3 pleaded guilty in @entity9 , @entity10 , in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13 - year - old girl , but fled to @entity13 before he was sentenced			1
he was arrested in @entity2 last year and had been fighting extradition since then			1
@entity2 was not making a decision about the severity of the charge or whether @entity3 was guilty , justice minister @entity15 said			1
" it 's not about qualifying the crime			2
that is not our job			2
it 's also not about deciding over guilt or innocence , " she said			0
the @entity2 rejected the @entity5 request because the @entity5 did not supply all the legal records @entity2 requested , and because @entity3 had a reasonable right to think he would not be arrested if he visited the country , she said			1
@entity5 prosecutors can not apply again to @entity2 to have @entity3 extradited , she said , but could apply to other countries to detain and extradite him			1
" we are deeply disappointed , " said @entity5 assistant attorney general @entity34 , head of the @entity36 's criminal division			2
" we thought our extradition request was supported by the facts			0
we 're going to review our options			0
" assistant secretary of state @entity40 also expressed disappointment , saying that the @entity5 " believes that the rape of a 13 - year - old child by an adult is a crime " and would continue to pursue justice in the case			1
asked about comments by the @entity2 attorney general that suggested technical errors in the @entity5 extradition request , @entity40 said : " a 13 - year - girl was drugged and raped by an adult -- this is not a matter of technicality			1
" @entity3 was 43 at the time he had unlawful sex with the girl			1
prosecutors dropped rape and other charges in exchange for his guilty plea			0
but @entity3 fled the country before he was sentenced after learning that the judge might not go along with the short jail term @entity3 expected to get in exchange for his plea			1
he has been a fugitive since 1978 and lived in @entity71 before his arrest			0
@entity2 authorities released the director from jail on $ 4.5 million bail in early december " pending extradition " to the @entity5			1
@entity3 's victim came forward long ago and has made her identity public , saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled			2
@entity81 , now in her 40s and a married mother of three , has called for the case to be tossed out			0
her attorney , @entity85 , reiterated her position in december , saying details of the case harm her every time the story is in the news			0
defense attorneys also argued that prosecutors are ignoring the victim 's wishes			0
@entity3 's attorney , @entity96 , has been pushing for @entity3 to be sentenced without having to return to @entity9			1
prosecutors have vigorously opposed sentencing him in absentia			0
in court papers filed in january , deputy district attorney @entity98 stated the reasons in no uncertain terms			0
" the defendant is a fugitive , " @entity98 wrote			0
" a fugitive child rapist , who for 32 years has made a mockery of our criminal justice system , should not be given the power or authority to request anything of this court until he , the criminal , acknowledges this court 's lawful authority by surrendering on his outstanding warrant			0
" @entity3 won an @entity4 for best director for the @entity117 drama " @entity118 , " and was nominated for " @entity119 , " " @entity120 , " and the screenplay he wrote for " @entity122			2
" @entity0 's @entity128 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
