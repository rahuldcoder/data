-- in 1996 , @entity1 received a phone call that changed his life			2
his oldest brother wanted him to record the movie that was airing on @entity7 one tuesday night			2
" i just did it to avoid a beating , " @entity1 admitted			2
as the eighth - grader surfed the @entity11 , he continued to get distracted by the movie unfolding on tv			1
he saw a @entity15 police box from the 1950s -- actually a disguised spaceship known as a " tardis " -- on the screen			2
" this blue box was bigger on the inside ! this had to be the maddest thing i 've ever seen			2
" soon , @entity1 was hooked on " @entity24			1
" seventeen years later , he has become a writer and actor with two " @entity24 " fan films on his resume			1
he credits the show for many of his friendships and his marriage			1
all of this because of a show about an alien with two hearts who travels through space and time , keeping the universe safe			2
ever since the @entity41 first aired this little science fiction series for families on november 23 , 1963 , it 's gained a fan base - often called " @entity45 " - that has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years , especially in the @entity48 " it 's certainly a broader base now , that 's certainly true , " said @entity49 , who portrayed the fifth doctor in the early 1980s			1
there have been 11 doctors in all , with a 12th on the way next month -- though they 're all the same character , much like @entity58 , but not exactly			1
people will tell @entity1 " how important the program was to them			2
perhaps they saw it at a very difficult time in their life and they could identify with the doctor or the companions in some way , and it became very important to them			2
and i do n't think i 've done another program where anyone 's said that to me before			0
" the show is celebrating its 50th anniversary ( with the worldwide simulcast of a special anniversary episode , including @entity41 and @entity77 on saturday ) , a rare feat for anything on tv , and has shaped the lives of generations of fans			1
it holds the @entity86 world record for longest running science fiction television program			0
a shared love of ' who ' @entity91 's life was affected quite quickly after being introduced to " @entity24 " in 2011			1
the @entity93 student was a fan of the show , but that fandom turned into something bigger when she saw that same 1996 @entity7 movie starring @entity98 ( the only episode of " @entity24 " where he was the star up until very recently )			1
" the eighth doctor is completely wonderful and terribly underrated , " she said			0
" i quickly fell in love with him			0
" she joined @entity104 and dived into the @entity106 community there , soon coming upon a photo of a man named @entity109 , portraying the character			0
her message to him : " marry me			0
" the two soon began a long - distance relationship driven by " @entity24 " ( @entity109 lives in @entity115 )			1
" it 's been a wonderful journey through time and space , and it certainly did n't take long for us to figure out that we had found soul mates in each other , even though we live on opposite sides of the @entity125			0
" @entity126 , who goes to fan conventions dressed as the third doctor , has a similar story			0
his future wife saw him in costume at the @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , and wanted a photo with him			0
" throughout the rest of the day we just talked about our mutual love of ' @entity24 ' and science fiction , " he said			1
" ' @entity24 ' has a magical quality about it that it can instantly break barriers and give someone hours and hours of conversation			1
two weeks later we were dating and we have n't looked back ever since ! " bonding over ' the doctor ' just as " @entity24 " has brought people together , it has also kept them from drifting apart			1
" because of my job , we have had to move a couple of times , " said @entity149			0
" all of them have been hard moves for the kids , particularly with my daughter @entity156			0
as she constantly had to say goodbye to her friends , her and i became best friends			0
' @entity24 ' became the show that really cemented our relationship through our love of the characters that shared a lot of the same stories of travel and loss that we did			1
" @entity149 spent months writing a 68 page @entity168 called " @entity156 and the doctor " which he gave his daughter for @entity171 in 2010			0
" there is the lesson that there are those in your life that you 'll leave , that will leave you , that will be taken from you and that will just fade away , " he said			0
" but they live in your heart and no one can ever take that from you			0
essentially , i was able to use the doctor to tell her what i as her father could n't			0
" they even went to @entity188 this year in costume and waited six hours in line to see the " @entity24 " 50th anniversary panel			1
" we were in the last 100 people to get into the 6,500 person audience and were the first in the world to see the trailer for the 50th @entity199 special ! " a fandom that has stood the test of time so what is it that has drawn fans to this quirky show over so many years ? " it transcends genre , " according to @entity210 , author of " @entity24 : the vault : treasures from the first 50 years			1
" " it has certainly been a science fiction show in its time , but it 's also been a horror show , a comedy , a historical adventure ... even a @entity219 , " he said			2
" it 's an institution -- part of the fabric our popular culture			0
" @entity225 , a fan from @entity226 , @entity227 , has noticed an increase in the show 's popularity lately			2
" i 've always considered myself a geek and felt the things i liked were pretty exclusive to like - minded people , " said @entity225 , who often portrays the @entity231 in costume			0
" however , it feels like in the last few years , the show 's exposure led to this massive increase of mainstream popularity			1
" he says there is a big difference between the small but devoted fan base who watched the show in the 1960s , ' 70s and ' 80s and the current , broader fandom that was introduced to the show by the rebooted series in 2005			1
some of it could be attributable to the internet where " @entity24 " memes abound on social media sites like @entity104			1
the likable , youthful portrayals of the doctor , especially by @entity258 and @entity259 could also explain its appeal to those in their teens and 20s , who may have considered it a " kids show " in the past			2
" i often hear stories about how ' @entity24 ' has really reminded people to embrace learning and creativity again , " said author and @entity272 ( " @entity274 " is his latest book )			1
" it 's great to see a hero who gets so excited by scientific progress and society rising above things like hatred and petty rivalry			0
it reminds the rest of us what 's supposed to matter			0
" he said the show 's family - friendly nature does n't hurt either , as it can get passed down from generation to generation			2
the doctor 's lesson plan to that end , @entity293 , a high school teacher in @entity294 , @entity295 , incorporates " @entity24 " into her classes			1
@entity298 has been a life - long sci - fi fan , with fond memories of " @entity301 , " but she discovered " @entity24 " over the past few years			1
" as a teacher , i take this idea of sharing the wonders the world has to offer and bring it to my classroom , " she said			0
" to me , the story of the doctor embodies many wonderful things we wish to strive for : being a hero , fighting for what is right , making the best out of bad situations , and most importantly , teaching others how to appreciate the wonders that surround us			0
we are able to take in the wonders and the excitement of the universe			0
