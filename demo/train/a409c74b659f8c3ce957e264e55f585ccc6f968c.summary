-- the @entity2 health system has been preparing since late march for the news we announced tuesday : the first case of @entity6 diagnosed in the @entity2			1
in this age of global travel , we anticipated that a traveler from a country with an @entity6 outbreak would come to the @entity2 and develop symptoms once they arrived			1
but from everything we know now , there appears to be no risk that anyone on this patient 's flights from @entity19 to the @entity2 was exposed to the virus			0
can you catch @entity6 on a plane ? clinicians on the front lines have been one key to our safety : identifying patients with both a history of travel and symptoms indicating they might have @entity6 , immediately isolating them , consulting their local or state health departments , and getting the patients tested as needed			2
indeed , since the outbreak began in @entity35 , @entity33 has consulted with state and local health departments on almost 100 cases in which travelers had recently returned from @entity35 and showed symptoms that might have been caused by @entity6			1
of those cases , 14 were considered to be truly at risk			0
specimens from 13 were tested and @entity6 was ruled out in all 13 cases			0
but now @entity33 labs have confirmed our nation 's first @entity2 - diagnosed @entity6 patient			1
i understand this can be deeply troubling news , especially after what we have witnessed @entity6 do in @entity35			2
but there are distinct differences in what will happen here			0
the @entity2 has a strong health care system and dedicated public health professionals -- all hard at work right now -- to make sure this case will not threaten the community at large , or the nation			1
a person who is sick from ebola virus disease can be cared for in @entity2 hospitals when the patient is isolated in a private room with a private bathroom and contact with them is highly controlled			0
every health care worker must meticulously follow every single infection control protection we recommend			0
how the ebola virus spreads public health officials , meanwhile , are also identifying people who have had close personal contact with the newly diagnosed patient and will follow up with them for 21 days , the longest known incubation period for @entity6			1
if they develop any signs of the disease , those people will be isolated , tested and cared for			0
the fact is that @entity33 has been preparing for this day , working around the clock with local and state health departments to enhance surveillance and laboratory testing capacity , provide recommendations for health care infection control and other measures to prevent disease spread , and deliver guidance and tools for health departments to conduct public health investigations			2
your @entity6 questions answered i 'm not going to promise that we can stop this at just one case , but i can tell you we have the advantage because the right steps are being taken , and i am therefore confident we will stop @entity6 in its tracks here in the @entity2			1
and there is one final thing to remember , even as the first case here grabs the headlines : we must be relentless in stopping its spread in @entity35			2
after all , after all is said and done here , that is the only way to truly and completely protect the health security of @entity2 -- and the world			0
