-- same - sex marriage became a reality on thursday in @entity3 , creating a nationwide majority of states allowing gays and lesbians to legally wed. @entity8 is expected to start soon			1
in @entity3 , a private group that had led the legal fight to defend the voter - approved ban suddenly withdrew its pending appeal for a stay with the @entity15 @entity14			0
the justices on thursday quickly removed that case from their docket , apparently removing the last legal hurdle to allowing gay and lesbian couples to legally wed in the @entity3			2
hours later , @entity3 state sen. @entity21 tweeted at katkinson702 that he 'd just tied the knot with his partner of more than six years , @entity24			1
" it 's done , we are married ! amazing ! what a 48 hours ! @ ballerwoody is my husband ! we were the first same sex couple to wed in the state of @entity3 ! here we are on the court steps with one of my favorite judges , with a lot of cameras and media around ! # progress # lgbt # equality # marriage " in @entity8 , gov. @entity39 , a @entity40 , announced thursday he would not challenge federal court rulings on same - sex marriage , clearing the way for the practice to begin statewide			1
" @entity8 will uphold the law according to these rulings , and i have directed state agencies to take appropriate action to make that possible , " he said in a statement			2
" i encourage all @entity51 -- regardless of their personal beliefs -- to uphold our statewide tradition of treating one another with dignity and respect			0
" the @entity8 's @entity58 later said county clerks would begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples by tuesday " at the latest			1
" nearly 3,000 same - sex couples live @entity8 , according to @entity64 's @entity63 , a think tank conducting research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy this follows the @entity14 's refusal monday to intervene in legal challenges over voter - approved bans in five states : @entity8 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
that meant three separate appeals court rulings striking down those bans as unconstitutional would go into effect quickly in those states , as well as six others covered by those courts ' jurisdiction			2
that would include @entity8 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , and @entity91			0
some states and localities are moving faster than others to abide by those rulings			0
@entity90 's attorney general and the state 's highest court on tuesday ended all pending legal obstacles , allowing same - sex marriage to begin there			1
a judge wednesday in @entity103 , @entity89 -- the state 's largest county -- also ordered same - sex licenses to be issued			2
but the @entity106 put things on hold while it continues to review the matter , meaning no licenses will be issued to same - sex couples in the @entity88			2
that request for a stay on enforcement came from state officials			0
@entity8 would become the 27th state to allow same - sex marriage , up from 19 states just a week ago			1
the number could top 35 in coming weeks , as other states move to enforce federal court orders			2
the issue had been initially uncertain in @entity3 after a federal appeals court on tuesday ruled bans in @entity3 and neighboring @entity125 were unconstitutional			0
the judges on that panel later that evening ordered same - sex marriages to begin immediately , but parties in @entity125 and later @entity3 separately asked the high court for emergency action , to put things on hold while the appeals process continued			1
@entity3 officials had delayed issuing marriage licenses on tuesday to same - sex couples because of initial confusion from the @entity14 over whether the state had such authority			1
the @entity125 application is still pending at the high court			0
@entity3 's legal situation was somewhat unique			0
a federal judge had initially ruled @entity3 's ban on same - sex marriage could stand , but the state attorney general later refused to defend the law in court , saying it would likely be struck down by the federal appeals court			1
a three - judge panel of 9th @entity152 did just that in a sweeping ruling earlier this week			0
state senator pops the question after @entity3 's gay marriage ban falls gov. @entity157 , a @entity158 , in february had said that for a variety of procedural and precedential reasons , " it has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court			1
" a private group , the @entity163 , then stepped in to defend the 2002 voter referendum , known as @entity165			0
that was the group that withdrew its appeal to the high court thursday			0
there are an estimated 7,000 or more same - sex couples in @entity3 , according to the @entity63			2
the @entity3 case at the @entity14 is @entity163 v. @entity172 ( 14a378 )			0
