-- the calendar is overflowing with occasions to mark			0
it seems like there 's a special day for almost everything			2
for example , september 19 is celebrated by some as @entity8			0
but the surplus of observances should n't detract from the really important ones , like friday , march 8 , @entity12			1
the first @entity12 was held in 1911 , but it was international only in the technical sense that women in four @entity17 nations marched			1
these activists were ahead of their time in thinking about women 's economic and political equality ; they may not have been so far ahead of their time that they envisioned what it has come to mean for many of us today			1
now , @entity12 represents a movement that is for every woman and girl , no matter where they live			1
this year , @entity30 became the youngest @entity32 nominee in history by risking her life for the cause of universal girls ' education			2
her courage has inspired women across the world			2
some of the bravest , most revolutionary voices about empowerment are coming from women and girls like @entity30 who are calling the world 's attention to social norms that prevent women from realizing their full potential			1
i just spent some time visiting the poorest parts of @entity52 , where i met a courageous woman named @entity54			0
because the government has invested in its basic health system , she received a visit from a trained health worker who told her that spacing her pregnancies was safer for herself and her children			2
@entity54 decided to use contraceptives despite the opposition of her mother - in - law			0
in @entity52 , husbands and mothers - in - law have been at the core of family decision making power structures for generations			2
@entity54 's courage in seeking outside information and defying her parents - in - law as a way to determine her own future and improve that of her children represents a huge leap forward for women throughout the country			1
here is the reality we must confront on @entity12 : the decisions women make about their families are the key to improving life for many of the poorest communities in the world			1
the evidence shows that in the developing world , women play a different role than men and are more likely to take care of their family 's health care and nutrition , things that children need to become productive adults and contribute to the economic and social development of societies			1
in fact , research has shown that a child 's chances of survival increase by 20 % when the mother controls the household budget			1
yet in many places , women , especially young women , have very little decision - making authority to be able to effect this kind of change			0
the work of making sure that women and girls everywhere can seize their potential is about making specific changes that will set into motion these longer term outcomes			0
for me , it means making sure they have access to the contraceptives so many women tell me they want and need			0
it 's also about harder to measure changes like whether they have the information and the power to plan their families on their own terms			0
when i try to imagine the future , i am optimistic because i see women demanding information and opportunities in the face of social norms that say they 're not permitted to do so			0
i 'm also optimistic because no matter where i go , people ask me , " what can i do to help ? " @entity30 and @entity54 are n't the only heroes			0
millions of peopleâ € ” men and womenâ € ” stand by the conviction that empowered women are a source of progress , and they want to take action			1
that 's why i 'm proud to announce the launch of my team page on @entity161 , a crowd - funding platform dedicated to supporting women and girls			1
i identified these three great projects from @entity166 , @entity167 , and @entity168 and hope you can join @entity170 to help fund them			0
our foundation will match every dollar donated to these projects			0
together , we can help women and girls determine their own future , no matter where they 're from			0
to me , this is why marking @entity12 is important			2
it 's a chance for so many people to move beyond " celebrating " and take action to create meaningful and sustainable change for women and girls			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 : @entity12 started small a *century* *ago*
she says there 's now global awareness of vital role of women in society , economy
when women can direct family budget , health care and education improve , she says
*gates* : empowered women are a source of progress , want to take action
