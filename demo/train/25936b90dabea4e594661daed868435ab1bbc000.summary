he is scheduled to appear the morning of july 16 at a federal court in @entity27 , where the criminal complaint was filed			0
that coastal @entity28 city is also where @entity4 built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of @entity44 cooking			0
but she 's been on her heels in recent weeks after admitting , in a deposition related to a lawsuit brought by a former employee , that she 's used the " @entity51 " in the past			2
chat : comfort food , uncomfortable topics @entity55 alleged @entity4 and her brother @entity56 committed numerous acts of violence , discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five - year employment at @entity63 and @entity65 's @entity64 , two @entity27 restaurants run by @entity4 and her family			1
in the media firestorm that followed , @entity4 lost at least nine lucrative endorsements and her @entity71 cooking show , while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled			0
so how does @entity7 fit in ? according to a criminal complaint , he interjected himself on june 24 , five days after details of @entity4 's deposition became public			1
on that day , he sent an e-mail to @entity4 's lawyer vowing that he was " about to go public " with information about the chef 's use of the " @entity51 " at @entity63 , according to a copy of the e-mail cited in the criminal complaint			1
@entity4 's accuser : ' this has never been about the n - word ' " the statements are true and damning enough that the case for @entity91 will be won on it 's merit alone , " @entity7 wrote , according to the @entity2			1
" as always ... there is a price for such confirmation			0
" you can contact me here if you feel it is necessary , " he said , referring to his e-mail address , the criminal complaint states			0
" or i can go public and we will see what happens then			0
" @entity102 , @entity4 's lawyer , exchanged e-mails with @entity104 and the two talked over the phone two days later , according to the @entity2			1
it was then that @entity7 allegedly asked for $ 250,000 " net " -- or total , with taxes having already been paid -- in exchange for not talking , the criminal complaint states			1
the two conversed a second time by phone june 27 when , " at the direction of the @entity2 , " @entity102 negotiated the hush money payment down to $ 200,000			0

@entity102 declined comment on the alleged extortion arrest			0
@entity123 , who was married to @entity7 for four months around 1986 , told @entity0 on friday that he once had his own restaurant in @entity27 though she has n't had much direct contact with him in recent years			2
meanwhile , according to the @entity2 's criminal complaint , @entity7 had also reached out to @entity91 's lawyer			1
in fact , the agency alleges that the 62 - year - old first reached out to @entity130 by e-mail and phone on the same day -- june 24 -- that he contacted @entity4 's lawyer			1
@entity130 said his staff conducted its own investigation of @entity7			0
@entity7 asked @entity91 's lawyer how much he 'd pay for derogatory information about @entity4 , the complaint claims			1
