-- with @entity3 , the world 's biggest video game expo , approaching , @entity1 and @entity2 are getting ready to wow the entertainment world with their next generation consoles			1
but some features of the new iterations of the @entity10 and @entity11 -- be they announced or just rumored -- are driving a wedge between the gaming giants and some of their fans			1
at the heart of the issue in both cases is whether gamers will be allowed to play games they buy on more than one console			1
that impacts everything from reselling games to taking them over to a friend 's house to play , but that could be at odds with game creators ' desire to make sure everyone playing their games have paid for them			1
@entity2 's pre-owned game policy for their new @entity37 console has been a source of confusion and contention			1
the company has issued conflicting statements about whether installing a game on a second console would require a fee , or whether doing so would lock the game on the original console			0
the company 's latest statement still leaves questions			2
" we know there is some confusion around used games on @entity37 , but we have confirmed that we designed it to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail , " the company said , with no elaboration , in a statement to @entity0			1
" beyond that we have n't confirmed any specific scenarios			0
" the phrase " we 'll have more details to share later " seems to be a common refrain from representatives , with the 2013 @entity3 opening in a few weeks			1
at @entity1 's event announcing the @entity70 , they showed off many new features for games and home entertainment			1
however , fans are now similarly clamoring for details into the company 's plans for digital rights management and the impact it will have on playing used games			1
the company has n't said , but that has n't stopped a preventative movement of gamers who have taken to forum threads and @entity87 , where they 're using the hashtags # @entity88 and # @entity90 to reach out to @entity1 executives			1
in game console terms , @entity92 is a code that allows users to access a game 's content			2
it 's designed to assure developers and publishers that only the person who paid for the game can play it			2
@entity1 has responded , saying they hear the concerns and are overwhelmed by the passion			2
they have previously made statements about not wanting to damage their relationship with their fans			0
but does that mean a @entity92 - free @entity70 ? only time will tell			0
@entity2 has also tried to reach out to fans			2
@entity110 , a director of programming for @entity111 perhaps best known by his gamer tag " @entity110 , " responded to a post on his blog with comments that gave some hope			0
" we 're fully aware of what is going on , " he wrote			0
" i am also working on a few things to address it			0
i ca n't say much more right now			0
" he attached @entity87 - style hashtags : # @entity123 and # @entity124			0
the reality is that @entity1 and @entity2 are n't the ones who would benefit most from drm or used - game restrictions			1
game publishers want to make sure they are getting paid for their work , and that includes the secondhand market			2
given a recent spate of studio closures and financial difficulties at others , it 's not hard to see where that desire comes from			0
as shown by a slow start for @entity143 's @entity142 , gamers base a lot of their decisions about which console to buy on the games that are available for it			1
@entity143 was dinged by some gamers for launching with a slim lineup and is currently launching a new spate of new and already popular titles in hopes of making up ground			0
in the end , it 's unlikely that large publishers will agree to one set of rules for one of the new consoles and another for the other			2
and that leaves worried gamers with a conundrum : which new device do you buy if they both are released with @entity92 and used - game bans ? and that , some say , could open the door for @entity143 , which does not have digital rights management on its games			1
@entity175 senior editor @entity174 recently wrote suggesting gamers buy a @entity142 as a message to @entity1 and @entity2 about how important the issue is to them			1
" rewarding that behavior with a boost in sales would be ridiculously effective , and send a much louder message than you ever could on @entity87 , " he wrote			0
" but that requires a change of behavior			0
" in other words , no one should expect this to happen			0
we wo n't see the true will of the players , for good or ill , until preorders begin			0
" all the gaps in information are likely ( we hope ) to be cleared up when each company holds its annual showcase at @entity3 , which begins june 11			0
then we 'll see whether used games are truly important , or ultimately irrelevant , to gamers being asked to open up their wallets .			1

new *versions* of @entity2 's @entity10 and @entity1 's @entity11 are on the way
gamers want to be able to share , resell the games they buy
companies are vague on whether they 'll be able to do so
publishers say *protections* make sure players pay for their products
