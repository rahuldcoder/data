@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity2 correspondent on monday angrily rejected a report by the @entity5 that he and other journalists were used as human shields by @entity1 leader @entity8 to prevent a missile attack on his compound			1
the @entity5 story , labeled " exclusive " and posted on the @entity5 website monday , said the presence of news crews from @entity2 , @entity14 and other organizations forced a @entity17 aircraft to call off firing seven @entity19 missiles at the area that already had been hit			1
" officials from @entity1 's @entity24 brought those journalists to the area to show them damage from the initial attack and to effectively use them as human shields , " said the @entity5 report			1
according to the @entity5 story , the curtailed strike " led to a great deal of consternation by coalition commanders			0
" @entity32 , a veteran @entity2 correspondent who was part of the @entity2 crew cited in the @entity5 story , called the rival network 's report " outrageous and hypocritical			1
" @entity32 said a @entity5 staffer was among the journalists on the trip -- a fact left out of the @entity5 report -- and that the journalists in the group were hurried through their trip by their minders			1
" to say it was a human shield is nuts , " @entity32 said , later adding : " i expect lies from the government here			2
i do n't expect it from other journalists			0
it 's frankly incredibly disappointing			0
" there was no immediate response from @entity5 to a @entity2 request for comment			1
the incident involved a trip sunday night arranged by @entity1 authorities to the @entity8 compound that had been bombed earlier by coalition forces			2
@entity32 said the 40 or so journalists on the bus were n't told ahead of time where they were going , and that there was no attempt by the @entity1 minders to restrict anyone from getting on or off the bus before they left			1
upon arrival , the journalists spent about 20 minutes at the damaged building and then were hurried to a tent where they waited with @entity8 supporters for him to appear , @entity32 said			2
@entity8 never showed up , and the journalists went back to their bus and departed , according to @entity32			0
a government official even pushed him onto the bus as he tried to broadcast a live shot at the end , @entity32 said			0
" if they wanted to use us as human shields ... they would have kept us there longer , " @entity32 said			1
" that 's not what happened			0
" @entity32 noted that the sole participant on the trip from @entity5 was n't normally a reporter or videographer , but was given a camera and told to go along			1
in general , @entity32 said , the @entity5 team in @entity0 rarely goes on the reporting trips arranged by the government			2
the @entity2 team goes in order to get whatever information it can to assess what happened and compare it to government versions of events , he said			0
otherwise , he noted , the journalists are dependent on government - edited videotape that likely omits key details			0
for example , @entity110 officials called the @entity8 compound a legitimate target because it included command and control capability , @entity32 noted			0
" we want to go and see : is it a command and control system ? what are the telltale signs there that the government would n't want us to see ? " @entity32 said .			0

@entity5 says journalists including a @entity2 crew were used as human shields in @entity1
@entity32 : @entity5 report is " outrageous and hypocritical "
the @entity5 report did n't mention a @entity5 worker also was on the trip , @entity32 says
