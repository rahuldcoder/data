@entity0 -- the convenience store near my house is where i first became aware of the problem			2
there , an overweight girl , maybe 10 years old , had just persuaded her mother to buy her potato chips and a slurpee			1
it was 11:15 at night			2
from that moment forward , i saw overweight and obese kids everywhere : at church , in @entity14 , at the movies			1
it was n't always this way			0
in fact , obesity rates for kids have tripled over the last three decades , according to a widely circulated report that appeared in the @entity23 journal late last summer			1
moreover , the @entity24 and nonpartisan government surveys say that one out of every three children in @entity28 is overweight or obese			0
think about that : one in three			0
( the @entity30 uses body mass index -- a formula that considers height , weight , age and gender -- to determine if a child is overweight or obese			0
click here for an interactive calculator to see if your child falls into either category			0
) studies find that overweight and obese kids are more likely to grow up to be overweight and obese adults			1
saddled with heart disease , diabetes , high blood pressure and myriad other preventable health problems , they will be sicker and may die earlier than the generation before them			0
consider this : last november , a report based on the research of dr. @entity54 , a noted @entity56 health care economist , found that 43 percent of all adults in @entity28 would be obese -- not overweight , but obese -- by 2018 if current trends continue			0
it was 15 percent in 1980			0
this epidemic not only threatens the well - being of our children but strains an overburdened health care system , hampers the productivity of our workforce and indirectly undermines our competitiveness as the world 's leading economic power			1
fortunately , there is reason to hope			0
first lady @entity72 is stepping in to lead a new initiative			1
having gotten her daughters settled into school and life in @entity0 , the @entity75 - educated lawyer is kicking off a program to bring attention to the childhood obesity epidemic			1
in terms of need and potential impact , i would argue that this is the most meaningful public service effort taken on by a first lady since @entity89 's " @entity90 " campaign of the 1980s			1
perhaps learning from early missteps of her husband 's administration , mrs. @entity72 is consulting members of @entity95 from both political parties before announcing the national effort			1
she has solicited their thoughts and ideas to incorporate into the plan			1
the first lady is using unifying and uplifting language to talk about the epidemic			0
she has refused to speak about it in abstract terms and does not disparage those who make unhealthy decisions for their kids , like the mom at that convenience store			2
she uses her own experiences to relate to other parents : " it was n't that long ago that i was juggling a full - time job with the round - the - clock role of being a mom			2
and there were plenty of times when after a long day at work , when the fridge was empty and everyone was hungry , that i just ordered that pizza , because it was easier			0
or we went to the drive - through for burgers , because it was quick and cheap			2
and i was n't always aware of how all the calories and fat in some of the processed foods i was buying were adding up , " she said , previewing her initiative in a speech to the nation 's mayors last month			2
on tuesday , the first lady will unveil the details of her comprehensive plan , the broad outline of which , she told a meeting of key members of @entity95 and the @entity144 , include four main elements : increasing the number of healthy schools ; increasing the amount of physical activity children receive ; improving accessibility and affordability of healthy foods ; and empowering consumers and families to make healthier food choices			1
she 'll spell out the details in the coming days			0
the childhood obesity epidemic is the newest front in the battle of the bulge , and mrs. @entity72 should be praised for using her mass appeal to shed light on it			1
she is right to argue , as she has , that there is no one solution , federal or otherwise			0
stopping this epidemic will require complementary efforts that bring together government , families , schools , foundations , businesses and others			0
here 's hoping that people across @entity28 hear mrs. @entity72 's call to action and join the national campaign to end childhood obesity			1
our collective future , in no small part , depends on its success			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 says obesity rates for kids tripled in past 30 years ; one in three affected
@entity72 launching *anti-obesity* campaign for kids this week , he says
he says she 's sought *bipartisan* *advice* in developing her plan
@entity183 : her four - part campaign will push healthier food , exercise at school and home
