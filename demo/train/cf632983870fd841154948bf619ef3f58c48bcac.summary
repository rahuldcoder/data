14 different countries to undergo especially rigorous security screening before being able to fly into the @entity13			0
under these new @entity8 guidelines , security screeners will conduct " full pat - down body checks " and extensive carry - on luggage checks for all passengers traveling from a country which the @entity13 considers to be a " security risk			1
" these 14 countries are : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
additionally , passengers traveling from any other foreign country may also be checked at ' random ' as well			0
these new rules mean that " every individual flying into the @entity13 from anywhere in the world traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening , " the @entity8 said			1
on its face , this clear use of ethnic , racial and religious profiling will not achieve greater security in the long term for our country			1
in fact , by targeting only certain passengers for additional screening , " blind spots " can be easily identified and duplicitously exploited by violent extremists wishing our country harm			1
defenders of the new rules might say they 're only profiling people coming from certain countries , but the fact that 13 of the 14 are @entity68 countries makes clear the religious nature of the profiling			1
this new policy deeply undermines the @entity74 administration 's stated commitment to civil rights , equality before the law , and a much - needed effort to rebuild @entity13 - @entity68 world relations since the disastrous presidency of @entity81			1
under international law , countries including the @entity13 that use race , color , ethnicity , religion or nationality as a proxy for criminal suspicion are in violation of international standards against racial discrimination and multiple treaties to which the @entity13 is a party			0
these include the @entity97 for the elimination of all forms of @entity100 ( @entity101 ) and the @entity102 ( @entity102 )			0
the clear alternative is for law enforcement agencies to focus on actual criminal behavior rather than solely on characteristics such as race , religion , ethnicity , or nationality			2
senior international security experts have suggested , for example , that such an approach would have increased the chances that suspected shoe - bomber @entity114 would have been stopped before he successfully boarded an airplane he intended to attack in december 2001			0
among the red flags were that @entity114 bought a one - way ticket with cash and had no checked luggage			0
for years , the concept of " racial profiling " has reportedly undermined important terrorist investigations here in the @entity13			1
most notably , these examples include the april 1995 @entity126 bombing in which the two white male domestic terrorists , @entity128 and @entity129 , were able to flee while officers operated on the theory that the act had been committed by " @entity134 terrorists " for the first 48 hours of the investigation			2
similarly , during the october 2002 @entity141 - area sniper investigation , the @entity137 - @entity13 man and boy ultimately accused of the crime reportedly were able to pass through multiple road blocks with the alleged murder weapon in their possession , in part , because police ' profilers ' theorized the crime had been committed by a white male acting alone			0
according to a report last summer by the @entity151 and the @entity152 to the @entity153 on the elimination of discrimination : " both @entity157 and @entity158 administrations [ in the @entity13 ] have acknowledged that racial profiling is unconstitutional , socially corrupting and counter-productive , yet this unjustifiable practice remains a stain on @entity13 democracy and an affront to the promise of racial equality			2
" in fact , not only do such " racial profiling " practices waste limited resources , they simply make us less safe			2
for example , the arrests of @entity172 ( a white , middle - class man better known as the ' @entity172 ' ) and @entity114 ( a @entity174 citizen of @entity175 and @entity177 ancestry now serving a life sentence at the @entity179 in @entity180 ) confirm that effective law enforcement techniques must rely solely on criminal behavior and not race , religion or nationality in order to ensure our citizens ' security			0
as the @entity194 said in an editorial : " the minute @entity13 officials put out the word that they 're not scrutinizing people with blond hair and blue eyes is the minute that @entity190 starts recruiting people with blond hair and blue eyes			0
would looking for @entity134 - @entity13 have turned up a passenger that resembled " @entity172 " fighter @entity172 ? would applying extra scrutiny to people with foreign - sounding names have kept would - be shoe bomber @entity114 off a plane ? " of course not			0
even conservative republicans like former house speaker @entity210 have argued that behavioral ( and not racial / ethnic ) profiling is the best way to prevent terrorist attacks on our country			1
" we need to have the knowledge to be able to profile based on behavior , " mr. @entity210 recently said on @entity217 's " @entity216 " while discussing the recent @entity3 foiled bombing			1
" not racial profiling or ethnic profiling , but profiling based on behavior and then , frankly , discriminating based on behavior , " he continued during the same interview			1
as our national debate on the phenomenon of " racial profiling " emerges once again , let 's remember these words of the chairman of the @entity231 , congressman @entity230 of @entity232 : " if dr. @entity233 were alive today ... he would tell us we must not allow the horrific acts of terror that our nation has endured to slowly and subversively destroy the foundation of our democracy			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241			2

new @entity8 rules amount to ethnic and religious profiling , says @entity241
he says profiling will create blind spots terrorists can exploit
@entity241 says scrutinizing behavior is the best way to *detect* terrorist plots
policy deeply undermines @entity74 administration 's commitment to civil rights , he says
