-- the first thing offered to me at @entity5 's @entity4 whiskey distillery -- the birthplace of @entity8 whiskey -- is a glass of water			1
it 's so delicious it comes as a shock			0
even before the reason is explained to me , i 'm asking : why does it taste so crisp , so different ? the distillery is surrounded by beautiful bamboo forests on a mountain -- they must be getting to my brain			0
it turns out the water in the area is the reason the first whiskeys in @entity8 were distilled here			2
" the distillery was built here almost 100 years ago for the legendary water , " says @entity26 , who 's been with @entity5 for 20 years , as we walk past a pond to the tasting room			1
drawn from deep mountain wells and designated one of the best mineral waters in the country by @entity8 's @entity39 , @entity34 's water is also reportedly the inspiration for the legendary @entity8 tea ceremony that originated centuries ago			2
these days , it 's used to make some of the most remarkable whiskeys on the planet			2
for some , @entity8 whiskey even trumps @entity46 as the go - to after - dinner dram			1
@entity49 's out any serious whiskey drinker is likely to recall , with perfect clarity , where and when they had their first taste of @entity8 whiskey			1
my first was a @entity55 17 , on a first date in @entity57 two years ago ( i was latecomer )			0
from the first sip , i loved how approachable it was , with hints of sweet fruit mingled with the oak			0
for most drinkers , the draw of @entity8 whiskey is n't just that its smoother , complex taste belies its years -- it 's the allure of being let in on something rare and refined			1
" drinkers seeking new flavors and tastes are increasingly turning to @entity8 for new drinking experiences , " says @entity68 editor @entity67			2
" there are some whiskies that have become esoteric , like the @entity75 , which are hard to obtain and represent a holy grail for drinkers and collectors			0
" " people who care about what they drink want something more interesting , not just the same selection ( available at ) any duty free store , " says @entity79 , owner of @entity80 , the latest high - end whiskey bar to open in @entity57 's trendy @entity82			2
despite a prominent display of @entity46 ( nocturne stocks 150 different whiskeys ) , @entity79 says his customers overwhelmingly seek out @entity8 selections			2
" what really surprised me was that female customers comprise a third of my clientele and they drink @entity8 whiskey straight , " says @entity79			1
" i think it 's because it 's more smooth and sweeter than @entity46			0
and from a value perspective , with @entity8 whiskey you do n't need to go for an older vintage to get quality			1
" out - scotching scotch thus is the world of whiskey being shaken			2
the 21st - century ascendancy of @entity8 whiskies recalls the @entity112 , the 1976 blind - tasting wine competition in which @entity107 wines were rated the best in every category for the first time , sending shock waves throughout the francophile wine world			2
for the past decade , @entity8 brands have begun to outrank @entity120 labels , a similarly unimaginable phenomenon			0
it started in 2001 , when @entity124 's @entity123 was named " @entity125 " by @entity68			1
then the @entity126 won gold at the @entity128 in 2003			0
since then , @entity8 whiskeys have consistently taken home medals at most major tasting competitions			1
at the @entity132 2013 held in the @entity133 , @entity5 was named " @entity142 " for the third time and its blended @entity55 21 years @entity135 won the @entity137 prize , the highest award in the competition 's @entity140 category			2
though in terms of global sales @entity8 whiskies amount to barely a drop in the glass -- none are among the world 's ten best selling brands -- @entity8 's top distillers have seen a steady increase in production and exports since at least 2006 , with @entity5 expecting to double its overseas exports by 2016			1
the most highly regarded @entity8 whiskeys ( the exception being @entity165 's @entity164 ) are produced by the distilleries of @entity8 's great rivals , @entity5 and @entity124			1
@entity5 is the reigning king to @entity124 's scrappy underdog , but @entity124 holds its own on the battlefield			1
this year 's $ 16 billion purchase of @entity172 made @entity5 the world 's third - largest distiller ; meanwhile @entity124 's exports reportedly grew by 18 times between 2006 and 2012			1
both their origin stories can be traced back to the same place , the @entity180 , built in 1923			0
that 's when @entity5 founder @entity182 hired @entity160 , the godfather of @entity8 whiskey , to set up the country 's first whiskey distillery			1
@entity160 had gone to @entity120 to learn the craft of whiskey making , and returned to @entity8 with a @entity120 wife			2
after 10 years with @entity5 , @entity160 left to build his own whiskey empire in @entity159 , @entity190 , in a climate he preferred for its similarities to @entity120			1
@entity8 whiskey tour my @entity8 whiskey pilgrimage begins from the @entity4 station , with a 25 - minute scenic train ride from @entity198			1
the countryside along the route is dotted with traditional houses and bamboo groves			0
the heady aroma of whiskey mingles with the clear mountain air			0
unlike the bastions of @entity120 's finest , the @entity34 distillery is one of the few in the world that can produce a variety of whiskeys from the same distillery , thanks to the different shapes and sizes of the distillery 's pot stills			2
with its 3,000 casks , the storage room is the most impressive sight on the distillery tour			0
in the @entity8 tradition of obsessive and innovative craftsmanship , the wood used in these casks has been the subject of extensive experimentation			0
while 200 - year - old @entity229 white oak has traditionally been the wood of choice , @entity157 has also introduced virgin @entity232 ( @entity8 oak ) barrels to give aromas of kara ( incense ) and sandalwood			0
the tour finishes at the beautifully rendered whiskey library , bar and gift shop where visitors can purchase varieties sold only on site -- including extremely rare single cask whiskeys -- in addition to the usual @entity5 offerings			1
@entity248 , to the north two days later , i 'm on my way to @entity124 's main distillery in snowy @entity190 , the northernmost of @entity8 's four main islands			1
what a different world it is			0
the train ride to the @entity257 is a stunning journey , past snow - dusted forests and white mountains , with the train running perilously close to the sea			0
at tiny @entity159 station , which has been blasted by alarming snowfall , only a handful of people get off			0
the @entity124 headquarters are as different from @entity5 's as a building can be -- a stone castle , with its own @entity271 - style insignia carved into the entrance			1
it 's the @entity273 of whiskey distilleries -- stark and gray and empty			2
the focus of the tour is emphatically on @entity160 's astonishing story			0
photographs , journals , maps of @entity120 , even snatches of tartan are displayed with detailed captions explaining how they influenced @entity124 's founder			1
unlike the light , modern feel of @entity5 's bar , @entity159 's bar looks like an old boys ' club , with mahogany finishes and mood lighting			1
i take a whiff of the rare single casks that can only be bought here			0
their scarcity makes them pricey compared with many older blends			0
@entity299 20 ( 500 ml ) is ¥ 15,000 ( $ 147 ) , while @entity299 15 ( 500 ml ) sells for ¥ 10,000 ( $ 98 )			0
while a @entity124 whiskey may be closer to scotch than say , a @entity34 , @entity8 whiskeys are still much sweeter and more fragrant than their overseas counterparts , with even the most peaty varieties still balanced			1
drinkers of @entity306 might enjoy the @entity307 and @entity308 available at the distillery			0
i end up purchasing a bottle for ¥ 6,500 ( $ 64 )			0
grand finale the highlight of the tour is the airy , open tasting room , where each visitor is given three samples of @entity124 's most popular whiskeys			1
setting down my tray next to the window , i look out at untouched fields of snow - covered trees and take my time sipping			0
i 've been traveling to @entity8 since i was a child -- of all the onsens and sushi restaurants and shopping forays and mountain walks i 've done and loved , i have to say , this is my absolute favorite @entity8 experience			0
until my next visit , anyway			0
