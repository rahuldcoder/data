the boy was scared , angry , insecure			1
his dad was away in prison , and the son did n't know how to grapple with his loss			1
" everybody says my father is so bad , but i really love him , " the boy said			2
@entity7 still recalls that conversation -- a reminder of her life 's calling			2
she worked on @entity12 for five years before realizing that she needed something more meaningful			2
" i just did n't feel satisfied , " she said			0
content is the founder of the @entity16 , @entity17 - based @entity19 organization , aimed at helping children cope with having a mother or father in prison			1
her organization works with about 200 children between the ages of 6 and 16 , all of whom have at least one parent in prison			1
" i call them the silent victims of incarceration , " @entity14 said			0
" they 're not the victim who the crime was committed against , but they are feeling the ramifications of their parents doing time			1
" more than 2.7 million children in @entity42 have a parent in prison , according to a 2010 study ( @entity46 ) by @entity47			1
for the vast majority , there are few outlets for the kids			1
children are left to be reared by grandmothers , aunts , moms -- themselves often already struggling below the poverty line			1
sometimes , they fall into the hands of the state			0
in some countries , children actually grow up behind bars with their parents because no one else can raise them and there is n't a social safety net large enough to take care of them all			1
@entity64 , one of this year 's top 10 @entity65 , runs a home in @entity67 where dozens of these children can live a more normal life , even in their parents ' absence			1
at her organization in @entity16 , @entity14 says separation from parents often leads to depression , anxiety and anger			2
in some cases , the kids witnessed the crimes their parents committed , so the group works with the children to remove the stigma they may feel			1
" there 's so many different scenarios that these young people go through , " @entity14 said			0
" but the one thing that 's consistent is , there 's a level of embarrassment of what your parent did , and they shoulder that level of shame			2
" across town from @entity14 , @entity98 runs the @entity100 , a nonprofit group that works with the state court system in helping inmates re-enter society			0
it helps about 250 inmates a year find jobs , get mental health treatment and strive for a life beyond crime			2
" lots of times when a guy comes home , there 's a lot of excitement , and the families welcome them back home , " @entity98 said			0
" but very soon after the honeymoon phase of the release ends , the reality starts to sink in : when are you going to get a job ? " for some , those pressures can lead them back			0
we do n't want that			0
" many times , a parent has missed large chunks of his child 's most formative years while serving time			2
that can create awkward and tense moments upon his or her return			0
@entity98 's organization works with a " family re-entry " social worker and interfaith groups to help ease that transition by providing help with rent , food and little things like diapers			0
" if you 're arguing because you do n't have @entity148 to contribute to the household , " @entity98 said , " we want to help solve that problem in the short term until you get on your feet			0
" they especially focus on men and women 18 to 24 years old , who are at the highest risk of committing crimes again			0
@entity98 's group provides counseling to give them the skills to be a successful parent while emphasizing that staying crime - free is an important lesson for their kids to witness			1
" they want to have those relationships with their children , " he said			2
at @entity170 , more than 100 letters of thanks adorn the walls			0
they are notes from parents in prison thanking the organization for keeping them in contact with their children			1
" they 're happy that we still respect this very important relationship , " @entity14 said			0
the children in the after - school and summer programs write to their moms and dads every two weeks			2
they include photographs , report cards and other items going on in their lives			0
often the kids will ask each other : what did you tell your dad ? in @entity67 , @entity64 also wants to preserve the bond between parent and child			1
during school holidays , she sends the younger children to the prisons to visit , and she brings them food , clothing and fresh water during their stay			2
she also started a program to teach the parents how to make handicrafts , which she sells to raise money for the children 's care			1
" often , they think that they 're useless because they 're in prison , " @entity64 said			1
" i want to make them feel that they are contributing			0
" who 's your @entity65 ? cast your vote now ! content believes that programs tailored to children are vital in breaking the generational cycle of incarceration			1
" the cycle does n't continue because ( the children ) saw behavior and repeated it , " she said			1
" from my experience working with the population , the cycle repeats itself because of the lack of support that this young person now has after going through these traumatic experiences			1
" the children are allowed to still be kids at her program			1
they play sports and other recreational activities			0
but the children also talk in groups about their feelings , and they are allowed access mental health support			1
" young people who have lost a parent to military deployment or death or even divorce , society has a level of compassion and understanding for that , " @entity14 said			2
" but for a child who loses a parent to incarceration , that same level of empathy does n't exist			2
" she recalls consoling the one boy who wondered about whether it was ok to love his father			0
" your dad is not bad , " she told him			0
" he made some bad decisions and ... is paying for those mistakes			0
you can feel good about loving him			0
" content knows that helping 200 children is " just a drop in the bucket " compared with millions of kids with incarcerated parents			1
but she hopes her organization grows , first statewide and then nationwide , to bring attention to society " about a population they may not even think about			0
" " if i 'm able to give a bit of a voice to the population , " she said , " i feel like i 'm doing my part			0
