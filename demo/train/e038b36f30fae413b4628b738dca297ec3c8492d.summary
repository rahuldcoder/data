-- would you go to work for nothing ? more to the point , would you do so risking life and limb riding a horse in one of the world 's toughest races ? these days amateurs competing in professional sport are almost an extinct breed , but @entity14 is a throwback to a bygone era -- the archetypal " gentleman jockey			1
" by day he runs a multimillion - dollar series of dental practices ; at the weekend he rides over some of the world 's toughest fences , unpaid and purely for the love of it			1
a modern - day jack of all trades , he boasts helicopter and plane licenses , is a keen mountaineer and is even credited as the man that got @entity32 's prince @entity31 and @entity33 back together after a pre-wedding separation			1
the highlight of his weekend job is looming on saturday : the @entity37 , the world 's toughest steeplechase with a prize fund of Â £ 1 million ( $ 1.66 million )			1
" the @entity37 for a jockey is a bit like a fighter pilot in his plane in a series of dog fights , " says the 31 - year - old , who will saddle up on one of the favorites , @entity44			1
" it 's a very unusual challenge of very intense periods and occasional moments of reflection			2
it 's a race that 's impossible to replicate			2
every single fence is a big challenge , it 's twice as long as your average race			2
" it 's the one and only race in the world where you can say it 's the best experience of your life even if you do n't win			0
" @entity14 has come close -- he was second on @entity65 in 2011 and fourth on the same mount a year ago			1
@entity44 , meanwhile , is a winner of the prestigious @entity67 and the @entity68 , two other jewels in jump - jockey circles			1
" one of my first memories is riding a rocking horse at home in which i acted out riding the @entity37 , " he recalls			1
" it 's a race i love , that gives me butterflies			0
if you do n't get that with the @entity37 , you should probably think about doing something else			2
" virtually every jockey in saturday 's field will be a paid - up professional , but @entity14 -- who has about 30 - 40 rides a year -- is just happy to be competing with them			1
" sometimes i watch the pros in the races and wonder how i can compete with them , " he admits			0
" they 're the best in the world , the best people that have ever ridden			0
it 's such a buzz to line up alongside them			0
" and i 'm very lucky to have been able to do that because of my @entity95			0
" @entity96 , son of the former lord mayor of london , owns the horses that @entity14 rides , and has enabled his son to pursue this hobby with , it has to be said , remarkable success			1
" an amateur in horse racing , in fact in all sport , is quite rare now , " says @entity109 " as sport is more and more professional , it 's harder to compete			2
" can someone that does n't dedicate themselves to it day - to - day do it ? it 's a good question			2
i hope i 've proved it 's possible and i would n't say it 's the end of an era exactly , but it 's becoming more rare			0
over the last 40 years there 's been less and less amateur jockeys			2
" national hunt racing is a dangerous business			0
at last year 's @entity125 , @entity124 was paralyzed after fracturing two vertebrae in a fall , while last month fellow @entity129 @entity128 , the 2011 @entity37 winner , was put into a medically induced coma after a fall			1
those are a mere snapshot of the sport 's dangers , which makes the decision by an amateur , and one who became a parent for the first time last year , all the more surprising			2
" i do n't go to the races thinking i 'm going to get hurt or that i 'm not going to come back , " @entity14 says			1
" if i felt like that i would n't do it			0
as for having a family , i think that makes it easier			0
it 's not the be-all and end - all anymore as you have a family to go back to afterwards			1
" but there are tough days when you fall off and are trampled over and you wonder , ' what am i doing ? ' " the reason for this adrenalin junky 's desire to continue racing is often attributed to his brother @entity155 , who died aged 20 in 2005 from @entity157 's sarcoma , a type of cancer			1
" that 's not quite right			0
it was n't so much his death that drove me on but more the way that he lived his life , " explains @entity14 , who still rides with his brother 's initials on his saddle			1
" i think he 'd be surprised how i 've got on in the saddle , but he 'd love it as the rest of my family do			0
" @entity155 would be rather more surprised with the business empire his brother has since built up			2
he is chief executive of @entity179 , which has 20 dental practices across the @entity32			1
he employs 300 staff and has 200,000 patients in all			0
he is hoping to double those numbers in the next two years			0
it had been rumored on the circuit that the business began after he looked around the weighing room one race day and saw the battered teeth of his peers , but he dispels this as another myth			0
" actually , there 's a dentist 's surgery on the way to one of the racecourses and i remember thinking , ' why is it only individual practices , why are n't there chains ? ' and it went from there , " he says			0
" but it 's very similar to horse racing			0
in racing , i surround myself with the right horses ; in business i 've surrounded myself with the right people			0
" @entity209 , he says , takes up 99 % of his work time while his " second job " is usually just for weekends except for events such as @entity125 and the current @entity37 week at @entity212			2
should he win in the chocolate and orange colors of his father , he will be the first amateur jockey to do so since 1990 , when journalist @entity217 rode mr. @entity218 to victory			1
" i believe i can win but that 's the beauty of the @entity37 as there will be 40 jockeys on the start line thinking the same thing , " @entity14 says			1
" you always need a bit of luck to get over those fences as there 's so many things that can happen			0
but i 'd say i have a great chance			0
" if victory is his , it will almost certainly come with a royal seal of approval			0
it was at his family 's 17th - century mansion that the @entity239 and @entity33 were reunited during a party that he organized , having split in 2007			1
@entity14 attended their wedding in 2011 -- although he downplays the significance of his role in getting them back together -- and the @entity33 was present when he was married later that year			1
" well , my comments on that have been taken out of context in the past so i 'll leave my role on that one there , " he says modestly			0
whatever his role , @entity14 is clearly a modern - day maverick , a man for all seasons .			1

@entity14 is credited with getting prince @entity31 and @entity33 back together
the amateur jockey will ride one of the favorites in saturday 's prestigious @entity37
but he also runs a multimillion - dollar dental business throughout the @entity32
he rides with the initials of his dead brother in his saddle after his death from cancer
