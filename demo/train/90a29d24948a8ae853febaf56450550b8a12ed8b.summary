in diplomacy , like in sales , success often depends on making your adversaries believe they proposed the result you wanted			0
by that measure , @entity7 president @entity6 appears to have closed the sale on annexing @entity10 from @entity11			1
on monday , @entity7 prime minister @entity12 visited the region that @entity14 now claims over international protests , while @entity7 also said it was withdrawing a battalion of infantry troops from the tens of thousands deployed near the border with eastern @entity11			1
meanwhile , diplomatic efforts focus on defusing the immediate threat of armed conflict and setting up a negotiating process , rather than necessarily reversing the @entity10 annexation			2
here are some questions and answers on how we got here and what to expect : what 's the story ? the @entity11 crisis has its roots in the breakup of the @entity34 more than two decades ago			0
a country of deep ethnic and cultural divisions , it comprises a more ethnic @entity7 population in the @entity39 and a more ethnic @entity11 population in the @entity41 , including @entity42 , the capital			2
months of increasingly violent political protests in @entity42 over the government 's reluctance to expanded relations with the @entity47 culminated in a february 21 agreement that called for constitutional changes and new elections			0
@entity6 says he 's pulling some troops back from @entity11 border @entity14 responded by sending forces into @entity11 's formerly @entity7 region of @entity10 , which is home to @entity7 's @entity55			1
@entity6 claimed ethnic @entity7 in @entity10 faced oppression and needed @entity14 's protection , a scenario rejected as false by @entity59 and its @entity61 allies			1
despite objections by the @entity11 government , the @entity63 , @entity61 nations and the @entity65 , @entity7 then engineered a @entity10 independence referendum that easily passed			1
as @entity59 and the @entity47 imposed sanctions , @entity14 and @entity10 took the legislative steps in recent weeks to complete the annexation			0
meanwhile , @entity6 warned @entity7 would protect ethnic @entity7 elsewhere from alleged attacks and discrimination , and tens of thousands of @entity7 troops gathered near @entity11 's eastern border raised fears of an imminent invasion			1
what 's the latest ? as tension climbed , @entity6 called president @entity78 last friday and the two leaders agreed that their top diplomats would try to find an opening for negotiations on resolving the crisis			0
in four hours of talks on sunday in @entity85 , secretary of state @entity86 and @entity7 foreign minister @entity87 focused on easing the border tension and working out a formula for a negotiating process that includes the @entity11 government			1
afterward , @entity86 told reporters that both governments agreed on the need for a diplomatic solution , and that the goal for now was de-escalating the crisis to allow for further talks			0
however , he never directly mentioned @entity10 or its annexation and he did n't repeat an earlier @entity65 demand that @entity7 troops leave @entity10			1
" both sides made suggestions on ways to de-escalate the security and political situation in and around @entity11 , " @entity86 said			2
" we also agreed to work with the @entity11 government and the people to implement the steps that they are taking to assure the following priorities : the rights of national minorities , language rights , demobilization and disarmament of the regular forces and provocateurs , an inclusive constitutional reform process , and free and fair elections monitored by the international community			0
" his bottom line ? " no decisions about @entity11 without @entity11			1
" meanwhile , monday 's movement of @entity7 troops -- whether a real withdrawal or symbolic shift -- signaled @entity14 's acceptance that the @entity128 talks yielded some progress			1
" if reports that @entity7 is removing some troops from the border region are accurate , it would be a welcome preliminary step , " @entity131 spokeswoman @entity130 said on monday			2
what does it all mean ? two weeks ago , @entity11 president @entity139 declared that his country was willing to hold talks with @entity7 , " but we will never accept the annexing of our territory			2
" while @entity86 alluded to the @entity10 annexation on sunday , calling @entity7 's " actions " illegal and illegitimate , he also noted that " @entity7 obviously has long ties and serious interests " in @entity11			1
in tense , defiant @entity11 border region , prayers are for peace -- unless peace fails in @entity59 , @entity154 sen. @entity153 of @entity155 made a similar point earlier sunday on @entity157 , saying that @entity10 is " dominantly @entity7			1
" she sounded resolved that the peninsula with a majority ethnic @entity7 population now had returned to @entity14 's provenance , as @entity6 wanted all along			0
" a referendum was passed			0
that , i think , has been done , " said @entity153 , who chairs the @entity163			0
" but @entity11 is a different subject			0
" her acknowledgment clashes with @entity78 and the @entity63 , who call the military backed annexation of @entity10 a violation of international law and dismiss the @entity10 secession referendum as a sham			0
@entity78 has threatened further sanctions targeting vital sectors of @entity7 's economy such as financial services , energy , mining , defense and engineering			0
however , it remains unclear if @entity61 powers such as @entity182 and @entity183 would join in such an escalation because of their stronger economic links with @entity7			0
what now ? more talks and diplomatic posturing , the @entity7 force shift monday involved several hundred troops at the most , which would be only a fraction of the 40,000 or more estimated to be near the @entity11 border for what @entity14 calls exercises			1
that means the next steps occur under the shadow of the @entity7 forces that @entity65 military officials say could launch an incursion on short notice			0
@entity78 's trump card is the possible increased sanctions targeting strategic sectors of the already struggling @entity7 economy as @entity14 assumes greater costs because of the @entity10 annexation			2
@entity12 said monday @entity10 state salaries and pensions should be raised to @entity7 levels , as should the pay for military personnel , while compulsory social insurance would be introduced to the region next year			2
he also said @entity14 would make @entity10 a special economic zone and review water supply projects for the region that now gets 90 % of its water , 80 % of its electricity and roughly 65 % of its gas from @entity11			2
a variety of outcomes remain possible , ranging from further @entity7 military incursions in other ethnic - @entity7 strongholds in the region to a negotiated political agreement in which @entity11 adopts a new constitution and holds new elections -- almost certainly minus @entity10 .			1
