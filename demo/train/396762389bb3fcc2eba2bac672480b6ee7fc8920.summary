the lake also has its own island , @entity17			2
that makes @entity17 the largest island on the largest lake on the largest island on the largest freshwater lake in the world			2
in other words , @entity1 is a destination			1
it 's not on the way to anything , which makes for special kinds of visitors , park ranger @entity26 said			1
the average stay is three to four days , compared with just a few hours in other national parks , @entity26 said			1
repeat visitors return each season to explore the park 's 165 miles of hiking trails , coastlines , bays and inlets , red sand beaches and rocky shores			1
the people who visit @entity1 really want to be there			1
" when people come here , it 's deeply personal to them , " @entity26 said			2
" for most people who come here , it gets in your blood and you ca n't stop , and that 's a remarkable environment for me to do what i do			2
" @entity55 stats : @entity1 was established as a national park in april 1940			1

meet our ranger : @entity26 is no stranger to geographic isolation			0
he spent part of his childhood in a home his parents built on a mountain in @entity90 , @entity91 , before moving around the rural environs of western @entity93			0
his run with the @entity95 began with a 2001 college internship at @entity98 's @entity55 museum , cataloging fossils and museum artifacts			0
after completing a master 's degree in forestry , he was volunteering at the @entity104 when a fellow ranger showed him pictures of other parks where he had worked			1
its size and location instantly intrigued @entity26			0
a few years later , he 's living his dream of working there			0
for a day trip , do n't miss : @entity114			0

the trail winds back and forth between forest and shoreline , offering stunning views of @entity128 , craggy bluffs and barrier islands			0
favorite less - traveled spot : @entity132 , mainly because of the effort it takes to get there			0
there 's only one nine - mile trail that takes visitors there and back , but it 's worth the journey for the gorgeous views of @entity14 , @entity26 said			0
there are also nice campgrounds and a dock for fishing			0
favorite spot to view wildlife : spotting wildlife throughout the park seems to be by luck , not design , @entity26 said			0
for example , no one had seen the pine marten weasel for decades when it suddenly appeared a few years ago			0
" if you 're quiet while hiking , it might happen , " he said			0
" it 's part of what makes it really personal for visitors			0
" most magical moment in the park : the first day he arrived , @entity26 sat on the dock by @entity165 , the largest ferry servicing @entity1 , and realized just how quiet it was			1
" you become more attuned to what 's going on around you , " he said			0
