@entity0 , @entity1 -- sen. @entity3 said this week that he would vote in favor of going to war with @entity6 , but his father , former rep. @entity7 , made it clear friday night that he sharply opposes further @entity10 involvement in the @entity12 region			1
speaking at a libertarian - leaning conference , @entity7 slammed the " bipartisan support " among congressional lawmakers for " rubber - stamping what president @entity16 wants " in the fight against the militant group			1
more broadly , he suggested that @entity21 @entity20 are n't that different from their @entity23 counterparts			2
some people think " if the @entity20 take over the @entity21 this year , that will hamstring the president and everything 's going to be ok , " he said at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity1			0
" that 's a joke			0
" " it would n't be ok because they all believe in the same thing , they believe in the federal reserve and they believe in the war			2
they believe in the spending and the intervention overseas , " he said			0
@entity16 's proposed plan includes expanded air strikes against @entity6 and arming and training @entity44 rebels who are also fighting off the threat			1
@entity47 has not voted specifically to authorize air strikes against @entity6 , but @entity3 has said he would vote in favor of doing so			1
the @entity50 @entity20 has long been more moderate than his father , a former @entity52 congressman who ran for president three times and has strong support among the libertarian base			2
still , @entity3 has largely opposed foreign interventions in the past , and his decision to support air strikes has been viewed as more hawkish than his previous stances			1
the @entity21 on thursday passed legislation that would also approve the arming and training of @entity44 rebels but @entity3 was one of 12 republicans who voted against the legislation , saying he feared the weapons would end up in the wrong hands			1
he launched into a lengthy @entity21 floor speech thursday against the plan , blasting " barnacled enablers " for pushing a policy that he believes would be ineffective			2
@entity7 never mentioned his son , who spoke the previous night on the same stage , during his remarks about foreign policy			1
the former congressman , however , said that the family got together the previous night to have " strategy meeting			0
" " i 'm going to reveal some secrets to you , " @entity7 told the audience , cheekily hinting that he was going to talk about @entity3 's likely presidential bid in 2016			1
but the former congressman jokingly went on to list a number of mundane family matters , such as when 's the next golf game and details about a family wedding			0
" we did have some very , very serious discussions , " he went on to say			0
" and of course some very important things too about what the family 's doing and that is the truth			0
the issues are very , very important to all of us , and yet the family is pretty important to us too			0

@entity7 slams " bipartisan support " in @entity101 for war against @entity6
