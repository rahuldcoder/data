-- @entity1 travel these days can feel designed to make a harried flier feel like nothing more than a piece of cargo			0
from the interminable security lines to boarding cattle calls , anonymity is the order of the day , and that often extends to the food court			0
in a sea of endless soft pretzel vendors , undistinguished subs and sad , wan salads , it 's always a treat for a hungry traveler to come upon an airport that 's serving food specific to its city			1
while the fare might not always be quite on par with what 's served at these restaurants ' in - town flagships -- hey , it 's hard to cook in an airport ! -- these 10 offer up the next best thing to a long layover , a rental car and a trip back through security			1
the varsity , @entity35 " what 'll ya have , what 'll ya have ? " servers at this @entity35 institution have been singing out that chorus for 85 years now , and your answer at the f - or c-gate airport outposts should be the same as it would be at the downtown drive - in : a chili - cheese dog and a fried peach pie			1
pair it with a @entity34 orange drink and board your flight full and happy			0
the @entity51 , @entity53 - @entity52 the heady scent of smoked meat beckons hungry travelers the moment they step off the plane , and plenty of people have even been known to get to the airport early to enjoy some pit - smoked ( obviously not on premises ) brisket and sausage			1
of course , it 's nowhere near the same experience as you 'd get driving out to to their decades - old , cash - only , @entity69 restaurant in the @entity70 , it 's a darned sight better than having no barbecue at all ( plus the line may be just a smidge shorter )			1
@entity75 , @entity76 where @entity79 stands strong for @entity70 - style brisket and sausage , @entity78 's joint makes the case for slow - smoked , sauce - smothered pork ribs , served up @entity76 - style			1
follow your nose , grab a heap of napkins , and build in a little extra time if you 're planning to eat in ( service can be as sloooowww as the cooking process )			2
and do n't skip the bbq spaghetti			0
it 's an only - in - @entity93 treat that you owe yourself to try at least once			1
@entity94 , @entity95 @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and scores of other country legends got their start strumming and singing for customers at @entity94			0
while the airport locale is miles away from the mini-chain 's flagship behind @entity95 's @entity109 , the same caliber of live performers grace the stage while travelers munch on their burgers ( the food is n't anything to write home about )			1
as with most of the town 's honky tonks , there is no cover charge , but it 's awfully good manners to toss a few bucks in the tip jar , especially if they take a request			2
@entity125 , @entity126 chef @entity127 is often referred to as the " @entity128 , " and for good reason			1
her versions of @entity134 classics like shrimp etouffee , red beans ' n ' rice and catfish are considered definitive , and the airport renditions stand faithfully			0
while you owe it to yourself to visit the original @entity143 location , where you can take in @entity145 's astonishing collection of @entity146 , her bowl of gumbo at the airport will let you know where yat			1
@entity150 's @entity149 , @entity152 / @entity151 it 's @entity154 , hon ! you got ta try a crabcake			0
@entity156 love few things more than debating the merits of various restaurants ' renditions of their city 's signature blend of lump crab meat , mayo , egg , seasonings ( usually @entity161 ) and just enough crumbs ( either bread or saltines ) to keep the whole mess together			0
though the original @entity150 's , which had been slinging up crabby delights in @entity152 's @entity174 since 1944 , has closed , the @entity151 locale sticks pretty close to the formula that made the restaurant a @entity152 classic			0
( you can also grab @entity150 's at @entity179			0
) @entity180 , @entity181 / @entity182 where else in the world can you tell your significant other that you 're just going to duck out for a three - way and have them ask if you can bring them back some extra crackers ? @entity181 natives will squabble ' til they 're blue in the face over which chili parlor reigns supreme : @entity180 , @entity192 , empress or @entity194 , but they 'll all agree that this soupy , @entity196 - style chili is the single finest spaghetti topping , alongside handfuls of fluffy , shredded cheddar ( three way ) , onions or beans ( add one for a four - way ) or all of the above ( five way )			1
sop up any spare sauce with oyster crackers , or add a cheese coney ( chili and cheese on a hot dog ) for a perfect @entity181 experience			1
@entity212 / @entity214 counter , @entity215 if it 's this seasonal and artisanal , it must be @entity215			0
these two local legends team up to serve sandwiches that are not just excellent for airport eating , but worth wrapping up an extra to take take home			2
the cheese maker and baker take great care to source their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors , making this collaboration a perfect bite of the @entity230			2
@entity231 's , @entity232 @entity233 or green ? that 's the state question , and it 's ably answered by the @entity236 specialties served up at this airport food court counter			2
the question refers , of course , to the color of chiles -- served atop enchiladas , burritos ( both standard and breakfast ) and other regional delights			0
" @entity252 " -- red and green together -- is also an acceptable answer , and the carne adovada ( long - cooked , heavily - spiced pork ) is a must for expats traveling through to less chile - centric destinations			0
@entity254 and @entity255 , @entity256 the @entity257 takes its hot dogs as seriously as it takes its hot rods , and a @entity262 experience is a must			0
while the style is n't exclusive to this chain ( there are more than 100 @entity267 by name in the @entity256 area ) , @entity254 serves up a solid version of the grilled , natural - casing dog , nestled in a steamed bun , topped with all - meat beanless chili and chopped , sweet onions and a stripe or two of yellow mustard			1
it 's a bit messy to eat on the run , so grab it and race on down to your gate to enjoy , or opt for one of the sit - down locations .			2

get the @entity35 airport 's finest chili - cheese dog and a fried peach pie
look no further than the @entity290 airport for @entity127 's @entity292 cooking
land in @entity76 and you can get some fine local barbeque within the airport walls
