-- " @entity1 " has a multitude of advantages over its rivals in the @entity7 race for best foreign language film			1
most obviously , it stars @entity10 , who plays an @entity12 pretending to be a priest in order to survive the brutal 1937 @entity16 invasion of @entity17 , @entity18			1
moreover , @entity10 's character , and several others , speak @entity21 , making the film much more accessible to @entity7 voters			2
lastly , it 's the official category submission from @entity18 , which just so happens to be the most promising unrealized market for blockbuster @entity27 films			0
but the @entity7 can also be very political , in every possible way			0
last week , when @entity10 was roughed - up on camera while attempting to visit @entity34 , a blind activist who had been under house arrest in @entity18 for documenting his country 's population - control measures , the @entity32 actor reminded western audiences of @entity18 's less - than - stellar human rights record			2
if that was n't enough , @entity18 authorities responded strongly to the scuffle , saying that @entity10 " should be embarrassed " by his actions			2
" he was not invited to create a story or shoot film in a certain village , " said a spokesperson for the @entity18 government			1
" i think if you want to make up news in @entity18 , you will not be welcome here			0
" think voters might now be tempted to view " @entity1 " in a different light ? the @entity54 film was n't the race 's favorite to begin with -- " @entity59 's @entity58 " looks to be the frontrunner -- but this public - relations controversy and @entity18 's belligerent response could have a severe impact on the war film 's @entity7 prospects			1
@entity27 's interest in access to @entity18 's restrictive market is now counterbalanced by a temptation to stick up for @entity69			0
did n't the @entity18 see the @entity71 scene in @entity32 ? in the real world , who cares ? @entity18 has broader interests than a golden statue			0
but make no mistake : @entity18 covets an @entity7 that would legitimize its booming movie industry -- " @entity1 , " with a budget of nearly $ 100 million , is its biggest project ever -- and despite two previous nominations in the category , the country has never won the trophy			1
now with its spotlight film 's most visible star at odds with the government , the chances of a @entity18 @entity7 could be dead on arrival			1
