@entity0 -- @entity2 was looking forward to a very special date night with her husband , @entity4 -- a chance to attend one of the inaugural balls with the president and the first lady			1
but a mistake by @entity11 -- the online sales agent tasked with managing the ticketing process -- led to the early release of all of the tickets to the inaugural balls and the inaugural parade , derailing the plans for @entity19 and thousands of other couples			1
" [ we ] just very excited about the possibility of going to the official inaugural ball , " said @entity2 , 48 , whose family of four is traveling across the country from @entity23 to @entity0 for president @entity25 's second inauguration			2
" we were planning to rent a tux and gown			0
" it started on sunday when @entity2 received an e-mail from @entity33 , the co-chair of the 2013 @entity34			1
the e-mail said that tickets with a unique link would be sent out the next day with access information to purchase the $ 60 - a - piece tickets inaugural ball tickets on a first - come , first - serve basis			1
the login allowed people to purchase tickets to the parade as well			1
" i was all ready , " @entity2 said , " i was going to stay home [ the next day ]			0
... i would just get on the computer and jump on it			0
" so when she saw another e-mail come in later that day explaining that tickets were available , she did n't think much of it			0
but @entity2 checked the e-mail later and realized that it contained a password and link to purchase the inaugural ball tickets			2
" i tried the @entity11 link on sunday and got an error message			2
when i finally got in , it showed that both the parade and ball were sold out			2
then it showed just the ball			0
" " it was as if the [ @entity34 ] was online scrambling to fix the issue			2
i tried again later and was blocked			0
my code and password no longer worked , " she explained			0
civil rights leader 's widow to give invocation at @entity25 's inauguration a third e-mail , this time from @entity11 , sent out later sunday night explained the mix - up : " public tickets to these events were originally scheduled to go on sale tomorrow morning -- you received the e-mail tonight in error , and @entity11 takes responsibility for this mistake , " the message said			1
@entity2 was n't the only person upset by the glitch			0
the presidential inaugural committee facebook page was lit up by people upset , angry and confused			2
some even thought it was a conspiracy to get tickets to a select group of attendees			0
" agree that [ @entity11 ] and [ @entity34 ] certainly knew			1
it seems likely that such a sophomoric ' mistake ' was planned by someone and those tickets will be seen on the black market soon , " @entity91 wrote on the @entity34 's facebook page			1
" i think that the @entity34 and @entity98 should cancel all tickets sold before the scheduled time and start over			1
this is the only honest thing to do and certainly possible given the event is more than 2 weeks away ... " " @entity106 " from @entity107 started a petition on the @entity105 website to , " @entity108 or have the erroneous @entity110 ticket sales voided			0
" the petition has received seven signatures -- just 24,993 short of the threshold needed for the @entity105 to address the issue			0
chief justice @entity115 to get another go at oath a @entity34 spokesperson revealed later that the e-mail containing the access information was supposed to be a test , but was instead sent as the live e-mail			1
" on sunday evening , @entity11 experienced a technical error that inadvertently caused an e-mail to go out ahead of schedule to people who had signed up for inaugural ticketing information with an invitation to purchase public tickets for @entity129 and the @entity130 , " the spokesperson said			1
" the @entity11 website was overwhelmed , slowing the purchasing process			2
@entity11 has taken responsibility for this mistake			2
" but the e-mail explaining the mix - up is was little solace to @entity2 who thinks that the tickets should be null and void and the process begun again , anew			0
" you show up at the start time ready to go and its fair game , " @entity2 said			0
" its not a fair game when some people were able to show up to the race start a day early and win			0
" a @entity34 spokeswoman said that the @entity34 would honor the sold - out tickets to the inaugural parade and the ball			1
the website explains now that due to an overwhelming demand , no more tickets are available			0
and while the @entity155 , who are @entity25 supporters , are disappointed that they wo n't get their night on the town , their visit , which is meant to be an educational experience for their children -- @entity162 , 14 and @entity163 , 11 -- wo n't be a complete loss			0
the family previously secured tickets to the @entity34 through their local @entity167			1
still , shut out of the balls means that a special date night is now all but out of reach			2
" the good news is , you can now go on @entity173 and purchase tickets to the ball for $ 6,500 , " @entity2 joked			0
indeed , individual tickets and bundled tickets to the official inaugural ball have been going for thousands of dollars on both @entity173 and @entity179			1
but @entity34 spokeswoman @entity180 told @entity1 that " tickets to official inaugural events may not be sold , resold or offered for resale in any manner unless expressly authorized by the @entity34 ( @entity34 )			1
tickets may be revoked at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of the @entity34 " she added that the inauguration committee is reaching out to ticket brokers and online distributors to seek the " nullification of those tickets " sold through unauthorized outlets .			1

@entity11 was supposed to distribute tickets to the inaugural balls and parade
they mistakenly released the tickets early , and they were sold out when most of the public went looking for them
thousands were shut out , upset at the *snafu*
the @entity34 said no more tickets are available
