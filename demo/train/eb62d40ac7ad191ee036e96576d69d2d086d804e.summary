the home side were lacking regular captain @entity11 and star striker @entity12 , but were rewarded for a dogged display against a @entity5 side who had the bulk of possession but created few chances			2
@entity7 took his in the 49th minute and can rarely have scored a simpler goal as he headed home into a gaping net after @entity23 's header from a @entity25 free - kick hit the post and rebounded invitingly for him			2
@entity5 , who had not lost to @entity1 for 10 years , continued to force the home side back , with @entity30 midfielder @entity29 outstanding in a rearguard action , being named man of the match			1
@entity35 's experimental central defensive partnership of @entity36 and @entity37 also held firm throughout , but @entity5 still might have equalized			2
@entity40 's volleyed shot hit the post with @entity1 goalkeeper @entity42 beaten and substitute @entity43 sent a late effort wide from an excellent scoring position			2
the final whistle came as a relief to the capacity crowd of just over 87,189 and @entity7 , who was substituted by @entity49 after his goal , said his team would not be getting carried away with their victory in the friendly			1
" for everyone it is a lift , but we have to be realistic			0
we know they dominated the game for long periods , " the @entity58 star told @entity59			0
" the back four and @entity29 ( @entity29 ) were fantastic , " he said			0
" they are without doubt the best team in the world			0
it gives us something to build on but we know we have to improve			0
" @entity7 's @entity58 teammate @entity11 , under investigation by the @entity70 for an alleged racist comment in a match against @entity73 , is expected to return for tuesday 's match against @entity76			0
but @entity12 , who is appealing against a three - match @entity78 ban , has been left out of the squad as @entity35 experiments for next year 's finals			0
in other international friendly action saturday , @entity83 continued their fine recent form with a 4 - 1 home win over @entity87 in @entity88			1
