-- the @entity2 presidential primary has n't exactly overflowed with talent			1
in december , it was a roll call of the undesirable right : @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- a list so long and bizarre that @entity14 could have slipped in on the end and no one would have noticed			1
except , as the citizens of @entity19 will tell you , the dead always vote @entity21			0
now , we 're down to a final three , discounting @entity9 , who , i 'm guessing , is only staying in the race to collect air miles			0
although the talent pool has shrunk , it has gotten no deeper			0
as @entity6 suffers defeat after defeat at the hands of @entity7 , whose chances of winning this thing are n't high , his negatives mount up , and the president looks stronger by the day			1
the @entity2 is divided and in danger of becoming out of touch			2
it did n't have to be this way			0
if @entity42 had entered the contest , i 'd hypothesize two alternative realities			2
one , she 'd have the nomination sewn up by now			0
two , she 'd be running even in the polls with the president			0
what have proved to be problems for the top three candidates would n't have been problems for @entity42			1
for starters , she has none of @entity55 's intellectual hubris			2
there 's no way @entity42 would have promised to put a mine on the moon or suggest arresting judges who make decisions that are too liberal			2
her conservatism is far more domestic and down - to - @entity63			0
she 's also more disciplined than @entity7			2
although we 'll probably be talking about them into the next century , @entity42 's only two serious public gaffes in 2008 happened when she was unable to name a newspaper and was stumped by the @entity69 doctrine , both slips a product of ignorance			2
@entity7 , on the other hand , is guilty of knowing his own mind all too well , offering unwelcome opinions on everything from the evils of hard - core pornography to the racial politics of the @entity80 tragedy			0
compare the response @entity42 gave to questions about her attitude toward evolution -- " i think it should be taught as an accepted principle , and i say that also as the daughter of a schoolteacher " -- with @entity7 's claim that @entity89 ... has attacked @entity90			1
it 's @entity42 who seems to have a better sense of the limited role that faith should play in politics and a better idea of when to keep her mouth shut			2
moreover , she would never tell a journalist that he was talking " bull * * * t , " even if she did congratulate @entity7 for doing so			0
contrary to the media narrative , even at her most accident - prone , @entity42 has always been a classy , well - choreographed performer			0
lacking the foibles of @entity8 and @entity7 , @entity42 would have been a far more effective @entity103 candidate because her strengths accentuated @entity6 's weaknesses			1
@entity6 is known as the @entity107 candidate ; @entity42 is aggressively authentic			1
@entity6 is seen by many as a moneyed elitist ; @entity42 is the conservative class warrior , happy to slam the " crony capitalism " that benefits both big labor and big business			1
@entity6 's limitations have been revealed , one by one , in the course of the primary campaign ; @entity42 was well - vetted by the press in 2008 and has nothing left to say or do that would surprise us			1
love her or loathe her , we all know who @entity42 is			0
her weaknesses , being old news , would n't have dominated the primary narrative like @entity125 or @entity126 the dog , made famous by his terrifying ride atop @entity6 's car			1
@entity42 would have spent the past three months attacking her opponents			0
then she would have turned her guns on the president			0
while it 's reasonable to speculate that @entity42 could have gathered a much stronger @entity136 coalition earlier -- and broken out as the @entity2 front - runner sooner -- it 's probably a bigger stretch to say that she would be running stronger against @entity139 right now			1
the last national polling done on a hypothetical @entity42 candidacy was in september , and that showed the president beating her by double digits			0
@entity145 did the math and gleefully calculated that @entity42 would win just seven states in november , and even @entity148 would be a tossup			0
but those polls asked the public what they thought of a candidate who had n't declared , who was n't representing herself in the debates and who was still solely defined by the 2008 race			0
guesstimating how well she would have done had she entered the 2012 contest is tough , but considering that at least some polls show both @entity6 and @entity7 within a few points of @entity139 despite all their problems , it 's not unreasonable to presume that @entity42 would run just as well			1
subtract @entity7 's gaffes or @entity6 's elitism , and she might even do a little better			1
polls suggest that many voters agree with @entity6 's approach to the economy but think he lacks empathy for the struggles facing the middle - class			1
were she in the race , you can bet your bottom dollar that @entity42 would n't score so low on compassion and authenticity			0
most important , @entity42 has the character and reputation necessary to break out of the @entity2 's demographic prison			1
in matchups with @entity139 , @entity6 's core vote is financially comfortable seniors			1
he pulls even among all men and folks aged 35 - 54			0
the @entity2 desperately need a candidate who can appeal to lower - income voters , who can rally men , who can gain women 's votes , who can bring out conservatives in large numbers and who can appeal to a younger demographic			1
all these things happened in the 2010 midterms , when the @entity2 made inroads into blue - collar households and middle - class suburbs on a policy platform virtually embodied by the @entity201 maverick			2
the @entity2 needs a @entity203 candidate -- either @entity42 or someone very like her			1
alas , it 's going to have to wait until 2016 to get its rogue			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity211 : if @entity42 were running , she would have the nomination in the *bag* by now
he says she lacks problems like @entity8 's hubris , @entity6 's elitism , @entity7 's *extremism*
@entity209 : @entity42 could rally male and *female* vote , young *people* , conservatives in large numbers
it 's too late , @entity209 writes ; the @entity2 will have to wait till 2016 to get its maverick
