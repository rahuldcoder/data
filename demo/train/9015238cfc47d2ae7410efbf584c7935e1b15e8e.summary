-- the spending bill which funds almost all of the government through september 30 , 2015 , has a lot of moving parts and special provisions			1
there 's more money to fight @entity9 and less money for the @entity11			0
the @entity12 is prohibited from legalizing marijuana			0
but the most important part -- and the most disturbing -- is the repeal of a banking regulation provision passed under the @entity18 law after the financial and economic meltdown of 2008			1
in @entity12 , @entity21 is back in charge			1
and once @entity24 get full control of @entity26 in january , they will relentlessly attack the financial regulations that help to prevent banks from putting the economy and taxpayers at risk			1
at first glance , the deleted regulatory provision is a little obscure			0
it prohibited banks from trading complex and risky financial instruments from within the bank 's main corporate structure , requiring those risks to be taken from separate subsidiaries -- hence the name of the provision , the " swap push out			1
" such transactions were " pushed out " under the @entity18 law so that insured deposits and access to the @entity48 's discount window would n't be tied to excessive risks			1
under the @entity18 provision , banks could still do their risky transactions -- they just could n't back them up with taxpayer - insured deposits			1
the 2008 financial crisis was caused in part by banks bringing these risks into their core business models , putting the entire financial system in danger when the transactions all went belly up			1
the result was that taxpayers ended up paying billions of dollars to bail out the banks			2
like other for - profit firms , banks take risks			0
but banks are also the financial system in our society , and aggressive risk - taking can threaten not only their own profitability , but the entire economy			2
that 's what we saw in 2007 - 2008 , when the excessive and unreported risks taken by financial firms almost plunged the world into an economic collapse and kick - started the worst downturn since the @entity84			0
but @entity21 is once again calling the tune , and @entity26 is dancing to it			1
the repeal of " push out " was accomplished with no committee hearings , no public testimony in favor or against , and no explicit votes on the provision			2
unbelievably , the repeal provision was taken , in large part word for word , from a memo written by lobbyists for @entity98			1
a tweet from rep. @entity100 , @entity101 , highlights sentences that are identical , showing how eerily similar the two documents are			0
rep. @entity104 , @entity105 , inserted the provision into the spending bill , with no debate or discussion			1
and when opponents got wind of it , banks pulled out the stops on lobbying			0
a source told @entity116 that @entity117 , chairman of @entity118 , made calls directly to legislators to argue in favor of repeal of the " push out " rule			2
it was only back in 2012 that @entity117 was defending $ 5.8 billion in losses from these types of risky transactions , in the " @entity129 " scandal			2
@entity118 later admitted to the @entity130 that the company 's traders may have been covering up -- in other words , lying about -- the extent of the losses			0
and now @entity117 has asked for , and @entity26 has granted , a relaxation of the very regulations meant to protect taxpayers from having to pay for these kinds of risks			1
this victory for the financial industry reflects the sad fact that expensive lobbying works			0
in the recent election cycle , banks and other financial institutions have so far reported over $ 1.2 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions , which works out to just under $ 1.8 million a day , according to @entity149			0
@entity150 and conservative tea party @entity24 both attacked the deregulation , but the repeal passed anyway			2
the @entity155 administration went along with it because officials wanted an overall budget agreement , fearing they would get a worse deal when republicans have control of @entity26 in 2015			2
sen. @entity161 , @entity162 , noted that " democrats do n't like @entity21 bailouts			2
@entity24 do n't like @entity21 bailouts			0
the @entity166 people are disgusted by @entity21 bailouts			0
" this repeal is testimony to how much power @entity21 has over @entity26 , and it sets the stage for more expensive future bailouts at the expense of taxpayers			1
in the next @entity26 , we will see full - fledged and well - funded attempts to gut much of the @entity18 law , to the benefit of banks but to the detriment of consumers , taxpayers and small businesses			1
an unidentified senior @entity24 @entity184 aide told @entity185 the latest rollback of regulation is one of " the first cracks in the @entity18 armor			0
" i would bet that many tea party supporters and advocates of small government did n't think they were voting to let big banks put the economy , and all taxpayers , at risk once more			1
but that 's what a @entity24 - controlled @entity26 looks ready to do			0
this bad decision on the " push out " rule is likely the first shot in an all - out anti-regulatory war that will enrich the banks further			0
but it will put the rest of us -- @entity24 , @entity209 and independent alike -- at greater economic risk .			0

@entity26 passed a spending bill that repealed a *critical* rule in the @entity18 law
@entity216 : essentially , it means @entity21 is back in charge
repeal of provision means risk of banks ' transactions will be passed to taxpayers , he says
@entity216 : repeal provision was *basically* from a memo written by lobbyists for @entity98
