he 's an old football player -- he 'll be back			0

pressure began mounting on @entity5 , a nine - term representative , on tuesday after comments to reporters in @entity52 by fellow @entity12 @entity176 sen. @entity176			1
" as a public official ... there reaches a point when you have a responsibility to tell people what you 're facing and how things are going			0
