-- @entity2 says it will attack the @entity4 military and " major targets , " if @entity4 shoots down a rocket @entity7 plans to launch in the coming days , @entity2 's state - run news service , @entity1 , reported thursday			1
@entity4 recently deployed its missile defense system in anticipation of @entity2 's planned rocket launch			1
" if @entity4 recklessly ' intercepts ' [ @entity2 's ] satellite for peaceful purposes , the [ @entity14 ] will mercilessly deal deadly blows not only at the already deployed intercepting means but at major targets , " @entity1 reported			1
@entity4 recently mobilized its missile defense system in response to the planned @entity2 launch , @entity4 officials said			1
the move , noteworthy for a country with a pacifist constitution , is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into @entity4 territory			2
@entity27 ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles have also been moved to the @entity30 , a @entity27 spokesman said			0
the threat of retaliation comes as @entity2 has begun fueling its long - range rocket , according to a senior @entity35 military official familiar with the latest @entity35 intelligence on the matter			1
the fueling signals that the country could be in the final stages of what @entity2 has said will be the launch of a satellite into space as early as this weekend , the senior @entity35 military official said wednesday			1
other @entity35 military officials said the top portion of the rocket was put on very recently , but satellite imagery shows a shroud over the stage preventing a direct view of what the stage looks like			1
the officials said the satellite payload appears to have a " bulbous " cover , which could indicate there is a satellite loaded on it			0
such a cover protects a satellite from damage in flight			0
while the sources did not know for sure what the payload is , they did say there is no reason to doubt it is a satellite as indicated by @entity2			2
@entity7 has said it will conduct the launch sometime between april 4 and april 8			1
it 's a launch that may violate a 2006 @entity73 resolution			0
resolution 1718 " [ d ] emands " that @entity2 " not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile			1
" " it raises questions about their compliance with the @entity82 , " @entity35 secretary of state @entity78 said last week			0
" and if they persist and go forward , we will take it up in appropriate channels			0
" @entity88 officials worry less about the payload and more about the launch itself , saying any kind of launch will give the @entity2 valuable information about improving their ballistic missile program			2
" i do n't know anyone at a senior level in the @entity35 government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile , " @entity35 defense secretary @entity95 said on sunday			0
defense analysts say the same rocket could be used to push a satellite into space or deliver a nuclear warhead			2
@entity95 noted that while the @entity35 believes it is @entity2 's " long - term intent " to add a nuclear warhead to any such rocket , he " personally would be skeptical that they have the ability right now to do that			2
" @entity95 said that the @entity35 military could shoot down " an aberrant missile , one that was headed for @entity117 ... or something like that , we might consider it , but i do n't think we have any plans to ( do ) anything like that at this point			0
" he does not believe @entity2 currently has the technology to reach @entity125 or @entity126			0
