-- @entity1 and the surrounding @entity2 , on @entity4 's east coast , present golfing visitors with such a bountiful harvest of links that there 's no single " correct " itinerary that best covers the region			2
many first - timers head straight for the slate of courses played in the @entity15 's @entity14 -- the @entity16 , modern classic @entity17 ( greens fee , $ 295 ) and , crossing the nearby @entity20 into @entity21 , @entity22 ( greens fee , $ 215 )			1
perhaps the @entity24 ( greens fee , $ 110 ) , a tough - as - nails layout with the fastest greens in town , might be thrown in for good measure			1
these are all top choices , and of course the @entity31 , with its supremely intricate design providing a different playing experience every time out , is an essential			2
but to make the most of one 's time in @entity1 , one should never simply be a big game hunter			2
mixing in some of @entity2 's less - heralded courses adds quirk , variety , fun -- and likely a few more birdies			1
in @entity1 it 's often overlooked that the @entity46 manages seven courses in and around the town , including the @entity49 ( greens fee , $ 20 ) and @entity51 ( greens fee , $ 40 ) courses , both of which are beginner - friendly , with fewer hazards but the same wonderfully crisp links turf as their big brothers			1
those looking for a stronger challenge on a full - sized course in town might try their hand at @entity64 's ( greens fee , $ 185 ) , part of plumbing tycoon @entity67 's @entity1 mini-empire			1
renovated in 2006 by golf architect @entity69 , who also added five new holes , the @entity64 's is a stylish heathland design that would likely garner more attention were it situated in any other neighborhood			2
holes like the seventh , a long dogleg right that begins with a dramatic drive from a hillside tee , and the 13th , a tricky par four with disarming views of @entity1 , are well worth seeing			2
but make no mistake , this is not a links			2
while the turf is reasonably firm , @entity64 's ca n't help but play more like an @entity85 course			2
for that reason , it 's probably better to schedule a visit early in the itinerary , before all those little swing adjustments it takes to play links golf set in			2
@entity0 : top hotel penthouses @entity93 @entity2 's two newest courses opened the same week in the summer of 2008 , and they could n't be more different			1
one of them , the @entity97 's @entity96 ( greens fee , $ 190 ) , debuted with the hype of a @entity101 blockbuster -- and similarly mixed reviews			2
the other , which would not look at all out of place in an episode of @entity107 , opened ( or , more accurately , reopened ) quietly after a 69 - year fallow period to become one of the most delightful golf experiences in @entity4			1
tucked away in the verdant hills west of @entity1 , @entity111 ( greens fee , $ 40 for nine holes and $ 55 for 18 ) is a nine - hole , 2,022 - yard country estate course that is played exclusively with antiquated equipment			1
proprietor @entity116 , always nattily attired in tweeds and plus fours , provides visitors with hickory - shaft clubs and replica golf balls from either 1898 or 1924			1
these clubs -- for example , a mashie with a perfectly smooth face , a niblick resembling a designer spatula or a driver bearing the signature of a 19th - century open champion -- are eccentric , to put it mildly , in both looks and performance			1
@entity135 shafts bend far more readily than steel , and once out on the course , golfers quickly find that in order to make clean contact , their swing must take on a languid , half - speed rhythm			1
this adjustment builds an element of comedy into the proceedings -- even the most skilled players are bound to hit a few laughable shots -- but the beauty of it is that it 's impossible to take this version of the game too seriously			2
it 's still @entity155 , just on a smaller scale			2
after all , a par four of a mere 200 yards becomes plenty challenging when a good drive flies only about 150			2
the click of the soft ball against the persimmon clubhead reverberates through the player 's hands and arms , a reminder of what modern technology , in its eternal quest for greater distance , has taken away from the game			0
afterward , @entity116 often joins visitors in the pro-shop cottage , where the yarns of the day are spun over ginger beer and homemade shortbread cookies			0
@entity176 , in essence , is the kind of place that can change the way one thinks about golf			0
@entity0 : perfect vacation villas to rent the @entity183 - @entity182 catapulting back to the 21st century , a modern layout that 's worth seeing is the @entity185 at the @entity186 ( greens fee , $ 75 - $ 140 )			1
the @entity186 property has always operated at a bit of a disadvantage because it 's two miles outside of town ( the resort runs shuttles back and forth ) , but it has a legitimate place on the scene			1
many golfers gravitate toward the resort 's @entity197 , as it is considered the " championship " track ( this august it hosted the @entity202 ) , but the @entity204 , designed by @entity205 with an assist from a legendary @entity207 champion , the late @entity207 , is almost as challenging and plays over a more appealing piece of land			0
many holes either swoop down toward or run right along the @entity211 -- the drivable par - four tenth by the cliff 's edge is particularly exciting			1
golfers frequently catch stirring glimpses of the @entity1 skyline and the @entity218			0
although the @entity185 is eminently walkable , golf carts are also permitted -- a point worth mentioning in a country where the motorized " buggy " is usually taboo			0
given that visitors to @entity1 frequently walk 36 holes or more a day for several days at a stretch , the chance to get off one 's feet and still play a quality course should not be underestimated			0
@entity0 : luxury safari camps real character time now for a classic			0
on the southern coast of @entity2 , about 20 minutes from @entity1 , lies the former @entity234 of @entity235 and its eponymous links			0
the game has been played here in some form since 1548 , and since 1875 the links have been overseen by @entity241 ( greens fee , from $ 120 )			1
for pure charm , @entity235 has few peers -- this , along with its prime location between @entity247 and @entity1 , makes it a popular " holiday club " for members of both the @entity252 and the @entity253 ( @entity253 )			0
@entity235 's quirky character is evident from the very first hole , where tee shots are fired blindly over a hill			1
to ensure that the group ahead is safely out of range of the one that follows , a club member came up with a novel solution : the starter 's hut is rigged with the periscope from a scrapped submarine , the @entity268			0
" it 's a sophisticated piece of equipment , " says the starter , @entity269			1
" the farther the distance [ of the target ] , the better the resolution			0
on a clear day , i can swing it round and see them putting at @entity253 " -- on the far side of the @entity279 , some eight miles away			0
@entity235 is a short course -- only 6,273 yards from the back tees -- but it 's full of surprises			0
with its ball - eating rough , well - positioned bunkers and ingeniously contoured greens , it does n't respect brute force without an equal degree of accuracy			1
it 's a throwback to an age when golf courses were laid out in accordance with the natural terrain rather than forced into a standardized mold			1
@entity235 reaches its par of 70 through the unorthodox combination of 16 par - four holes and two par threes			1
the absence of par fives may come as a disappointment to flat - bellied bombers accustomed to chewing up such long holes , but they should still find an eagle chance or two : for example , the wonderful 288 - yard tenth , a blind hole where a well - placed drive crests the rugged ridge and catches the downslope , then scrambles up to the green			1
but beware : with a helping wind , the long hitter runs the risk of driving the ball over the green and into perdition on the rocky beach			0
putting around one of the best local diversions is the @entity324 ( fee , $ 3 ; the links , @entity1 ) , which probably delivers as much enjoyment per dollar as any course in @entity4			0
this tiny patch of land right next to the @entity16 is one of the few bits of turf not controlled by the @entity97 -- it 's owned by the @entity332 , which has operated the course since 1867			0
as the name might suggest , this continuous swath of green features some of the wildest , wooziest contouring anywhere , with humps , bumps and hollows galore to vex and delight golfers of all ages			0
the @entity324 has the same kind of lighthearted spirit as an inspired miniature golf course , but it 's played on real links turf , so even the most serious players should find reason to smile			1
it 's the perfect way to end a day at the @entity352			0
@entity0 : a global guide to yachting @entity355 should the temptation to return home with a set of hickories prove strong , consider paying a visit to @entity361 and @entity362 at the @entity363 , a 130 - year - old concern that 's one of the world 's last remaining manufacturers of playable hickory clubs			1
sets start at $ 1,300 ; 20 @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity1			0
booking @entity16 for decades now , tee times at @entity16 have been allotted through a byzantine ballot system			0
the drawing is conducted a day in advance , so visiting players -- unless they 've made arrangements through a premium tour operator like @entity379 or the @entity380 -- have to throw their names into the hat and cross their fingers			0
if it does n't work out , they end up scrambling to find somewhere else to play on short notice			0
fortunately , this policy is about to change			0
starting in 2012 , the ballot will be extended to two - day advance booking , which should make a world of difference			1
greens fee starts at $ 225 ; reservations@standrews.org.uk			0
