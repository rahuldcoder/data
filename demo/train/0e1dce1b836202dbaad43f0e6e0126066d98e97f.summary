-- when @entity2 approached journalists last week at @entity5 's @entity4 , she did more than accuse @entity7 's men of rape			1
she also became the face of the @entity11 movement			1
since the highly publicized incident , which ended with a hysterical @entity15 being whisked away by government minders , the 29 - year - old lawyer from @entity13 has been celebrated as a symbol of @entity19 defiance			1
" many @entity19 i know online on social media are holding up @entity2 as a hero , " said @entity20 , an @entity21 - born journalist who writes columns on @entity24 and @entity25 issues			1
" and many people across the region -- @entity21 , @entity30 -- ( are ) demanding to know where she is and fearing for her life			1
" a day after @entity36 was taken into custody , a spokesman for the @entity19 government said she had been released			1
he also said her report -- that she was kidnapped and gang - raped by 15 of @entity7 's men -- would be investigated			2
but nobody close to @entity36 , including her family , has heard from her since her reported release			2
even if she is soon confirmed to be safe and sound , one could say the damage has already been done to @entity7 's regime			2
@entity47 's capture and detention added fuel to the @entity19 opposition by garnering global sympathy for its cause			1
@entity54 pages and @entity55 feeds from around the world have continually paid tribute to @entity15 and made her a rallying cry for revolution			1
" everyone can see the expression , almost in real time , of the face of this woman being yanked by @entity7 's security and alleging rape , which is very powerful , " said @entity61 , vice president of @entity62 and @entity63 for the @entity64			1
" and they can relate to how brave she was to ... put her story forward			1
" @entity75 might be the latest symbol of @entity24 unrest , but she is far from the first			2
iconic figures have also emerged in other countries : -- in @entity21 , @entity82 helped mobilize @entity21 's youth and force out president @entity84 , who had led the country since 1981			1
@entity82 , a 30 - year - old @entity86 executive , played a key role in organizing the anti-government protests in january			2
he was detained for 10 days by the government , but when he was released he became even more vocal , sitting down for media interviews and addressing thousands of demonstrators at @entity93 's @entity92			0
-- before @entity82 in @entity21 , there was fruit vendor @entity95 in @entity97			1
@entity95 , 26 , kick - started the entire @entity24 upheaval after he lit himself on fire , protesting his humiliating treatment at the hands of the local government			0
less than two weeks after his death , @entity97 president @entity104 @entity103 had resigned in the wake of massive public protests			1
" everyone tells me when i go there , ' if there were no @entity113 , none of this would have happened , ' " @entity61 said			0
-- and even before the recent wave of unrest , there were the 2009 protests of the @entity119 election			1
@entity120 , 26 , became the rallying point of the protesters ' struggle when she was fatally shot during the government 's crackdown			0
her death was captured on video and aired worldwide			0
" when we look back , we tend to associate specific causes and struggles with individuals and particular moments , " said @entity128 , an assistant professor at the @entity129 at the @entity130			0
" in the case of @entity21 , for example , @entity136 represents ... the core of the @entity21 democratic revolution that toppled @entity84			1
when we think of him , details are not required			0
his name tells the story of an entire people and political cause			2
" the importance of having a ' face ' the mass media and new technologies have played a tremendous role in creating these icons , @entity61 said , and their influence can not be overstated			1
" if this would have happened 20 years ago , when we did not have satellite tv , when we did not have @entity54 , when we did not have @entity55 -- when we were dependent on the government - controlled media to report on the story -- then @entity95 would have died in vain and hardly anyone would have heard about him , " he said			1
@entity61 said that when he first started working in journalism , there were fewer than 100 satellite television stations in the @entity24 world			2
" now there are 750 , " he said			0
" three years ago , there were 400			0
so the governments ... they 've lost control [ of the message ] pretty much all over the @entity62			0
" the exception to that might be in countries that heavily restrict foreign media , such as @entity119 and @entity30			1
the death of @entity120 was n't caught on television cameras -- it was captured by a cell phone			0
and despite the impact of her death in inspiring protest , the @entity119 government was eventually able to quell the dissent			1
@entity183 , an assistant professor of history at the @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 , said " having someone as a face of a revolution is nothing new			1
" he pointed to historic figures such as @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 in @entity196 and @entity197 in @entity198			2
" but the importance of having an immediate face for the revolution seems to be increasing in an age of 24 - 7 internet and television media coverage , " he said			1
it also helps mobilize the public quickly and efficiently , @entity128 said			1
" successful revolutions require some form of mass mobilization to challenge established power , " he said			0
" these stories and individuals can inspire millions of people to sacrifice themselves and to take the necessary risks that are needed to push forward a political cause			2
" authoritarian regimes remain in power due to fear and political apathy			0
if this can be overcome , change becomes possible			2
" the power of one story can not be underestimated , said @entity224 , a professor of @entity62 history at @entity226			2
he experienced it himself when he was a student protesting the @entity228			0
" i remember that one of the things that got us even more loudly into the streets was what we really saw as the martyrdom for @entity236 students who were shot down in 1970 , " @entity224 said			0
" i remember so many of us walking around just infuriated and determined to work even harder to oppose ( president ) @entity237			0
... in our minds , ( these protesters ) became sort of symbols for us of the need to be willing , if need be , to sacrifice yourself for a greater cause			0
" @entity224 has been paying close attention to the " @entity247 , " discussing the latest developments on his blog and analyzing the politics in play			0
with civil unrest festering in countries such as @entity254 , @entity30 and @entity255 , he expects more new faces to come to the forefront			0
" it 's going to be a very , very different era about to open up , " he said			0
" and there may be , as part of that , new heroes who are going to be emerging			0
" people need heroes , and people often seize upon very unlikely heroes like @entity95			0
you never know who it 's going to be next			0

alleged rape victim @entity2 has become the public face of @entity19 defiance
the revolution movements in @entity21 , @entity97 and @entity119 have also had their own iconic figures
experts say that all it takes is one powerful story to mobilize the public and inspire change
the growth of satellite tv and the internet has had a major role in creating recent icons
