@entity0 -- tangled thickets and thirsty mosquitoes safeguard the secret of @entity5			1
less than two kilometers from the mainland @entity7 border , in a quiet shadowy grove by a local village , sits a rare 200 - year - old wild incense tree			1
" no one in this village even knows that this is an incense tree -- except me , " says the 54 - year old @entity5			2
" i love these trees because i grew up with them			2
" he wants to ensure his two young sons do as well			0
officially known as @entity17 , " agarwood " was once a common commodity , but is now rare because of illegal logging			1
@entity5 has been trying to change that			0
over the past four years , he has planted 10,000 new trees on @entity0 's only incense plantation , part of a family business passed on to him from his father and grandfather			1
all told , the plantation has some 300,000 incense trees			1
" my grandfather was the one in the family who started planting these incense trees back in the day , " reminisces @entity5			1
" when i was young , i followed him up into the hills to help			0
now , i see a lot of incense trees in @entity0 have been logged , so i want to preserve them			1
" while incense tree conservation is one of @entity5 's motivations , a lucrative livelihood is another			1
@entity5 explains he can sell a sapling for as much as $ 600			2
the 10,000 trees he planted could mean millions if he were to sell			2
but if left to mature at least 10 years , the trees can be an even bigger moneymaker once harvested -- supplying incense powder , fragrant wood used in herbal teas as well as traditional @entity7 medicines with anti-inflammatory properties			1
the wood itself can command a hefty sum			2
@entity5 says one arms - length carving can command $ 125,000			2
he adds his buyers usually come from @entity56 and mainland @entity57 after they learn of his business through word of mouth or through his website			0
but because of its high price and limited supply , the incense tree has also become a victim of its own value			2
mainland @entity7 loggers are to blame , says professor chi - @entity68 , chairman of the geography department at the @entity70			0
" they would come here -- of course illegally - usually in a fast boat at night			0
they would land and then climb into the hills , and stay there to actually set up some kind of rudimentary camp - and even cook there , " explains @entity68			0
" and then they would systematically find these trees			2
its value is comparable to gold , but of course , we are talking about the highest quality			0
" over the past 90 years , @entity88 has been legally trading in that quality			0
long , slender aromatic joss sticks line the shop 's walls			0
an incense burner sits by the entrance , puffing out a smoky scent to passersby			0
the most expensive incense wood sells for $ 2500 per kilogram			1
about once a month , employees hand roll incense sticks from scratch -- starting with incense power , water and secret , trade ingredients			0
business has been bustling , says employee @entity105			0
" in the past five years , i can see from my shop that there are more customers buying incense wood			1
the most popular products are the ones that are used for worshipping gods			0
" in fact , incense is primarily used for prayer and how @entity0 got its name			1
hundreds of years ago , this city served as a regional supplier of scents -- an @entity121 hub for aromatic affairs			0
" @entity125 " means fragrant in the local @entity124 language			0
" @entity0 " means harbor			1
in the meantime , @entity5 hopes people will not forget the city 's heritage as he nurtures the city 's last incense plantation to save the " @entity125 " of @entity0			1
" i hope my incense trees can grow bigger and be everywhere			1
even though @entity0 is urbanizing i think more trees can and should be planted			1
