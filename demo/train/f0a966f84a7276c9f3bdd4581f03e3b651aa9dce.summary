after entering the stadium via an @entity25 like red carpet parade , @entity4 started in midfield against the team he faced in the league just days ago			1
beckham ' excited ' on that occasion , he managed just 14 minutes , but manager @entity31 gave the player every opportunity to impress			2
and while he displayed his characteristic style of passing , it was a through ball from @entity38 which released @entity22 to fire home a 35th minute opener			0
the @entity42 grabbed his second 19 minutes into the second half , slotting home from the penalty spot to wrap up a comfortable victory			2
in @entity49 's @entity48 , @entity47 booked its place in the final against city rival @entity52 thanks to a 2 - 2 draw at @entity54			1
@entity47 , which is second in the league under manager @entity56 , arrived protecting a 2 - 1 lead from the first leg			1
and it quickly got into its stride with just six minutes gone when @entity61 's fierce effort flew into the corner from 20 - yards			2
@entity54 was facing an uphill task and that was increased further when @entity65 swept home from close range with 29 minutes on the clock			2
but the home side refused to buckle and @entity70 produced a wonderful curling effort to reduce the deficit before the interval			0
@entity61 should have ended the contest on 54 minutes but somehow slid his effort wide of the far post when he looked certain to score			0
@entity54 had chances of its own with @entity78 also going close , before @entity80 's late strike made it 2 - 2 on the night , but it was not enough as the visitor progressed 4 - 3 on aggregate			0
@entity84 blown away by @entity85 in the @entity86 , @entity85 continued its impressive run of form to make the last four after it overcame @entity89 1 - 0 thanks to an @entity92 strike			1

@entity102 , 34 , made his @entity117 debut for the @entity119 club during the last 16 first leg tie on february 20 which finished 1 - 1			1
had @entity103 been found guilty of fielding an ineligible player , it would have been handed a 3 - 0 deficit going into the second leg in @entity125 on march 12			0
elsewhere , @entity126 was fined $ 52,500 and ordered to play their next two home games in @entity98 behind closed doors			2
the punishment comes after its fans were accused of throwing fireworks and displaying racist behavior in the @entity134 contest against @entity135 on february 21			0
