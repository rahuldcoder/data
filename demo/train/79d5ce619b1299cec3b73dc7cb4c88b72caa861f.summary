@entity0 -- in testimony that sharply contradicted the @entity5 administration 's initial narrative of the september 11 , 2012 , terrorist attacks in @entity8 , @entity9 , three witnesses shared firsthand accounts this week of what happened before , during and after the attack			1
the three testified before the @entity14 , recounting the horrific events that took the lives of four heroic @entity17 that day at the @entity17 consulate			0
much of what we have known about @entity8 to this point has come from @entity5 administration sources			1
the accounts of these brave witnesses raise troubling questions about the veracity of what we 've been told by official sources since the attack took place			1
the first contradiction pits former secretary of state @entity34 's explanation of security conditions at the compound against that of @entity38 , the former regional security officer at the @entity39 in @entity40			2
in his testimony wednesday , he repeated assertions he 'd made to congressional investigators last year that his recommendations to upgrade security were ignored at the highest levels			1
yet roughly four months after the attacks , @entity48 told the @entity50 that " specific requests and decision making " on security " rest with the security professionals			0
" even more disturbing was the discrepancy over what happened during the attack			0
the official story in the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) report concluded there was no " undue " denial of support or assets			0
yet we heard testimony from deputy chief of mission @entity68 that four special operations military personnel in @entity40 were preparing to go to @entity8 on a rescue mission when they were told to stand down			1
this is jarring , taken against then - defense secretary @entity75 's claim in february that " time , distance , the lack of an adequate warning			0
prevented a more immediate response			0
" opinion : @entity8 hearing 's real target : @entity48 in 2016 furthermore , the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) , which the @entity85 's website calls " the @entity88 's only interagency , on - call , short - notice team poised to respond to terrorist incidents worldwide " was not called into action			1
for nearly two weeks after the attack , the @entity5 administration continued to peddle the story that it began as a demonstration against a video and got out of hand -- a claim that is now universally understood to be false			1
but at wednesday 's hearing , rep. @entity98 , @entity100 - @entity99 , quoted what he said was an internal e-mail dated the day after the attack in which assistant secretary of state @entity105 told the @entity9 ambassador that @entity108 group @entity107 was responsible for the attack			1
the video claim was pure fiction , but @entity68 testified that he was reassigned to a lower - level position after he questioned it			0
( a @entity85 spokesman maintains that @entity68 was not subjected to retaliation			2
) more troubling than the initial video claim , however , is the allegation of serious flaws in the report issued by the @entity60 , convened by @entity48 , whose members include retired diplomat @entity121 and retired adm. @entity122 , former chairman of the @entity123			2
all three career diplomats who testified wednesday complained about the report , which they said was incomplete and assigned blame to the wrong personnel			0
as congressional investigators have tried to get answers , the @entity85 has thrown up roadblocks			1
for example , @entity68 testified that the @entity85 sent a lawyer from @entity0 in an unsuccessful attempt to ensure that i did not speak to him privately during my visit to @entity9 after the attacks			2
these concerted efforts by the @entity85 to conceal information from @entity140 should raise red flags			1
we have four dead @entity17			0
to date , nobody has been captured or killed			0
the terrorists are still on the run			0
and we have an increasing number of contradictions between what we were led to believe and what the witnesses say actually happened			0
it 's hard to take any refutations of the testimony seriously given the impeccable credentials of the witnesses and the despicable record of misdirection from this administration			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			2

@entity161 : testimony this week on @entity8 contradicts administration 's initial narrative
he says 3 diplomats ' firsthand testimony cast doubt on veracity of administration 's account
rep. @entity98 said an email showed @entity85 knew @entity108 , not video , behind attack
@entity161 : @entity180 has repeatedly misdirected , *thwarted* @entity140 investigators
