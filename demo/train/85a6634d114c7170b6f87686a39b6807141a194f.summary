@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 has added the brake systems of the latest @entity7 hybrid vehicles to a growing list of problems with various models , the company said friday			1
the company said it was checking the brakes on the @entity7 vehicle model @entity13 -- as well as a @entity1 model called the @entity16 -- because they use the same system as that used on the 2010 @entity18			1
@entity4 has announced no recall of these vehicles , however , and said it has not received any complaints about the brakes from consumers			2
but the @entity25 @entity24 announced thursday it is opening a formal investigation into problems with the @entity18 , @entity4 's fourth - best selling model in the @entity25 and the best - selling model in @entity1			1
the company has acknowledged a software glitch that is causing problems with its braking			1
it said it is looking further at the best way to repair the problem			0
on thursday , @entity36 announced that it was changing the software in the braking system for its @entity40 and @entity41 hybrids to correct an occasion glitch in the old software			1
@entity36 said no injuries had been reported involving the problem			0
the @entity40 / @entity41 's issue seemed less serious than that of the @entity18 , said @entity48 , the head of auto testing at @entity51			2
the @entity24 investigation involves only 2010 model year @entity18 hybrids , which went on sale in the middle of last year			2
there are only 37,000 of those vehicles on the road , according to the agency			0
the @entity18 , which is built in @entity1 , is not one of the eight models affected by two recent recalls -- covering several million vehicles -- to fix problems with sticking gas pedals			1
all of those models were built at @entity68 plants			0
@entity24 said its @entity70 investigation has received 124 reports from consumers about problems with the @entity18 brakes , including four reports that involved crashes and two that resulted in injuries			1
no fatalities have been reported			0
investigators have spoken with consumers and conducted preliminary field work			0
late wednesday , @entity4 president @entity82 spoke with @entity25 transportation secretary @entity83 , reassuring him that @entity4 takes @entity25 safety concerns seriously and puts safety at the top of the company 's priorities , according to @entity24 's statement			2
@entity4 had only limited comment on the probe			0
" we have heard about @entity24 's intention to begin an investigation			0
@entity4 will cooperate fully with @entity24 's investigation , " the company said in a statement			0
even if the solution ends up being a relatively simple and inexpensive software adjustment , the @entity18 braking problems come at a bad time for @entity4 , which has seen its prized reputation for quality and safety badly damaged by the recalls and the news attention given to them			1
the company has estimated that the problem with the gas pedals will cost it about 100,000 sales this year and $ 2 billion in repair costs and lost revenue			1
other experts say the problem could be more long - lasting if consumers who once trusted the @entity4 brand decide to shop elsewhere			1
the @entity18 problem is a " disconnect " in the vehicle 's complex anti-lock brake system that causes less than a one - second lag before the brakes start to work , @entity4 said thursday			1
at 60 mph , though , a vehicle will have traveled nearly another 90 feet before the brakes begin to take hold			0
the company also said it changed the braking system software in january for vehicles built since then			2
but it has yet to determine how to fix the brakes of vehicles already on the road			0
@entity2 's @entity134 and @entity136 's @entity135 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
