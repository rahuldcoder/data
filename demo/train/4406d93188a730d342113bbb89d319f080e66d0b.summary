-- perhaps the @entity2 ' @entity1 should have had @entity5 interview @entity3 and @entity6			1
in a sort - of philosophical , sort - of promotional interview , the two children of @entity9 and @entity10 talked about the flexibility of time , the feeling of the @entity15 and , well , some new music			1
the interview attracted wide notice on social media , where the general reaction was , " huh ? " " have you guys read this bizarre @entity25 interview ? " asked @entity21			1
" every single thing about this @entity25 and @entity6 interview is nuts , " @entity26 observed			1
at the least , the 16 - year - old @entity3 and his 14 - year - old sister did provide some fodder for interesting holiday party conversations			1
here are five things we learned from the interview : they have a fluid grasp of time			1
@entity3 said he 's reading about quantum physics ; @entity6 said she 's been immersed in " ancient texts			1
" the works have obviously made an impression , since they both talked about how time is relative			1
" time for me , i can make it go slow or fast , however i please , and that 's how i know it does n't exist , " said @entity6			1
" it 's proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe			2
it 's relative to beings and other places , " added @entity3 , who noted there is " a theoretical physicist inside all of our minds			1
" they separate themselves from their minds			2
if @entity62 is living in the @entity64 ' minds , they 're trying to keep their distance			2
@entity6 said she 's gotten better at " caring less what everybody else thinks , but also caring less and less about what your own mind thinks , because what your own mind thinks , sometimes , is the thing that makes you sad			1
" your mind has a duality to it			2
so when one thought goes into your mind , it 's not just one thought , it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain			0
when you 're thinking about something happy , you 're thinking about something sad			0
" creativity , he observed , " comes from a place of oneness			0
... and you ca n't listen to your mind in those times -- it 'll tell you what you think and also what other people think			0
" they 've been creative for years			0
despite their youth , the @entity6 children have been active in the arts for awhile			2
@entity3 has appeared in a handful of movies ; @entity6 had a hit single with " whip @entity99 " in 2010 , which came out just before she turned 10			1
but that 's not the half of it , said @entity3			2
" @entity6 's been writing her own novels since she was 6 , " he said			2
there 's a reason for that , said @entity6			2
" there 're no novels that i like to read so i write my own novels , and then i read them again , and it 's the best thing , " she observed			0
they do n't care what you think			0
even as they focus their own minds on oneness , they 're making sure others ' criticism does n't intrude			0
" @entity6 just dropped a song ( ' cares ' ) , let me quote the lyrics : ' i do not care what people say , ' " said @entity3			1
" we both do n't really care			0
" part of the point , he added , is to keep others -- and themselves -- on their toes			0
" the only way to change something is to shock it			0
if you want your muscles to grow , you have to shock them , " he said			0
" if you want society to change , you have to shock them			0
" the pair have big plans , they said			0
besides making music , writing novels , being inspired by the @entity15 and trying to get an " authentic " education ( " you never learn anything in school , " said @entity3 ) , the siblings have an eye firmly on the future			1
" i have a goal to be just the most craziest person of all time , " said @entity3			1
" and when i say craziest , i mean , like , i want to do like @entity156 - level things			0
" " i think by the time we 're 30 or 20 , we 're going to be climbing as many mountains as we can possibly climb , " @entity6 added			1
go get ' em , kids .			0
