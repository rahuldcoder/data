@entity0 -- top congressional republicans on friday used a new dismal jobs report to blast @entity5 ' push for more tax revenue in the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations , arguing that such a move would derail an already shaky economic recovery			1
federal officials reported friday that the economy added only 18,000 jobs in june -- far below the number predicted by most economists			2
unemployment inched up another tenth of a point to 9.2 %			0
" today 's report is more evidence that the misguided ' stimulus ' spending binge , excessive regulations , and an overwhelming national debt continue to hold back private - sector job creation in our country , " said @entity19 speaker @entity18 , @entity20			1
" a debt limit increase that raises taxes or fails to make serious spending cuts wo n't pass the @entity19			2
" @entity19 majority leader @entity33 , @entity34 , said the jobs figures " serve as a warning that as we address the debt limit increase we should n't do so in a way that raises taxes and impedes the ability of small businesses to create jobs and get people back to work			1
... let me be clear : republicans will not agree to tax increases			0
" president @entity49 did n't respond to the @entity47 , but reiterated his call for a rapid conclusion to the debt ceiling talks			1
the employment report " confirms what most @entity53 already know , " the president said at the @entity19			2
" we still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do			0
" " the sooner we get " an agreement raising the debt ceiling , the sooner businesses will have " the certainty that they will need in order to make additional investments to grow and hire , " he said			2
@entity18 on saturday said that the insistence by @entity49 and @entity5 on raising revenue through higher taxes prevented any chance that @entity47 could support a major deal that also would cut spending and reform entitlement programs such as @entity75			1
the @entity19 immediately pushed back , with a senior administration official saying @entity18 initially accepted the need to increase tax rates on wealthy @entity53 as part of a deal , but then @entity47 offered a different plan in the talks with @entity49 that began thursday			1
@entity18 said the parameters of the negotiations would be scaled back from what the administration had requested and the focus would be on spending cuts already discussed in previous talks led by vice president @entity90			2
" i believe the best approach may be to focus on producing a smaller measure , based on the cuts identified in the @entity90 - led negotiations , that still meets our call for spending reforms and cuts greater than the amount of the debt limit increase , " @entity18 said in a statement			2
the @entity19 maintains it will still push for the big deal and reiterated rejection of a short - term , temporary agreement to get the debt ceiling raised , a senior administration official said saturday			1
@entity18 and @entity33 were part of a group of eight congressional leaders from both parties that met behind closed doors with @entity49 at the @entity19 thursday to help hammer out an agreement to raise the nation 's $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling			1
@entity115 officials have warned that a failure to raise the limit by august 2 could led to a possible default with catastrophic economic fallout , including skyrocketing interest rates and a plummeting dollar			1
the group is scheduled to meet again on sunday			0
@entity49 said in thursday 's meeting that he will not sign any agreement that fails to raise the debt ceiling beyond the 2012 election , according to two congressional sources with knowledge of the talks			1
the president has signaled a willingness to include reforms to popular entitlement programs such as @entity134 and @entity75 as part of a broad agreement for between $ 3 trillion and $ 4 trillion in deficit cuts over the next decade , said @entity139 officials familiar with the negotiations			0
defense spending and tax reform are also on the table , the officials told @entity1			0
" nobody 's plan is going to be the plan that emerges , " @entity19 press secretary @entity145 said			2
" comprehensiveness and balance are our targets			0
" congressional democrats , meanwhile , are wrestling with rising anger among liberal @entity19 members in the wake of news that the president might agree to entitlement cuts			2
a group of progressive @entity19 @entity5 said thursday morning they are collecting signatures for a letter to @entity49 opposing any reductions in @entity134 , @entity75 , or @entity164			1
the members warned that they would oppose any deal that cuts entitlement programs or fails to raise taxes on the wealthy			2
" we feel that the discussions have been skewed up to this point , " said rep. @entity168 , @entity169			0
he called for protection for " programs that are essential to working folks and the middle class			0
" " the debt must be addressed , but it should be done in a way that is fair to all , " said rep. @entity176 , @entity177			0
the politically influential @entity180 , formerly the @entity180 , also weighed in , warning it would oppose any deal cutting @entity134			0
" @entity180 urges all lawmakers to reject any proposals that would cut the benefits seniors have earned through a lifetime of hard work , " said @entity182 , the organization 's ceo			0
@entity19 minority leader @entity190 , @entity177 , who met with @entity49 on friday , told reporters she wants the president to " have the room " to reach a deal , and offered her " full cooperation to do that			1
" however , she said , @entity19 @entity5 " do not support cuts in benefits for @entity134 or @entity75 , " and negotiations on specific reforms to those programs should be separate from a broader deficit reduction deal			1
@entity190 linked entitlement reforms to @entity139 calls for eliminating @entity206 - era tax cuts for wealthy @entity53 by restoring higher tax rates for families earning more than $ 250,000 a year			0
" do not consider @entity134 a piggy bank for giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country , " she said			0
@entity1 has learned negotiators are considering the possibility of raising the @entity134 retirement age and trimming benefit levels for older @entity53 with incomes over $ 60,000			0
cuts in the range of $ 500 billion are being considered for @entity75 , @entity164 and @entity134 , a congressional aide close to the negotiations said			0
democrats like senate majority leader @entity223 , @entity224 , have long rejected such cuts			0
the aide , however , insisted the only real talks going on are between @entity49 and @entity18 , who are holding discussions " in good faith			1
" the two men met last weekend , a @entity47 official told @entity1			0
if @entity49 and @entity18 reach an agreement on such an ambitious package , they realize it will likely be met with stiff opposition from lawmakers in both parties , the aide said			1
@entity241 - backed conservatives will oppose revenue hikes , and @entity5 will oppose entitlement cuts			2
that said , the aide indicated , @entity49 and @entity18 believe they can each gain politically from making an attempt to cut a grand deal -- even if it is rejected -- because the public would see they tried to take bold steps to solve the problem			1
if it is rejected , the two can fall back on a $ 2.4 trillion deal put forth before the talks collapsed			0
senate minority leader @entity258 , @entity259 , will likely reject such a deal , in part because @entity47 believe they have a better chance of winning back the @entity263 if a long - term deal fails , the aide said			1
@entity5 are confident @entity47 will ultimately agree to some revenue changes -- such as a hike in some fees and the closing of some unpopular tax loopholes			1
but it will be much more challenging to get them to agree to significant and costly reforms like the capping of tax deductions for people earning more than $ 250,000 per year , the aide said			0
if @entity47 ultimately reject any revenue increases and @entity278 ca n't raise the debt limit , democrats believe @entity47 will be blamed for causing a default , according to the aide			1
publicly , both sides continue to rail against proposals by the other			0
@entity49 said wednesday he wants a deal with @entity278 in the next two weeks , but did n't rule out using a constitutional argument to increase how much money the government can borrow			2
" i do n't think we should even get to the constitutional issue , " @entity49 said during a @entity291 town hall at the @entity19 in response to a tweeted question on whether he would rely on a clause in the 14th amendment to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling			1
the debt ceiling should not be " used as a gun against the heads of the @entity53 people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners , " @entity49 said , calling for " a balanced approach where everything 's on the table			1
" @entity1 's @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , and @entity312 contributed to this report			0

@entity47 leaders say friday 's poor jobs report is more evidence tax hikes ca n't be part of a deal
democrats and @entity47 are trying to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling by august 2
@entity18 says that @entity5 ' insistence on tax hikes *jeopardizes* any long - term deal
@entity19 source says @entity49 will insist on a long - term deal in talks sunday evening
