@entity0 -- the leatherback turtle is one of the ocean 's titans			1
the largest member of the turtle family , it is also one of the world 's biggest reptiles , outsized only by some species of crocodile			1
adults can weigh more than 900 kilograms and reach more than 2 meters in length , with the largest ever discovered measuring about 3 meters from bill to tail			2
the species gets its name from its ridged , dotted carapace which , unlike other sea turtles , has the texture of hard rubber			0
spending virtually its entire life at sea , the leatherback -- the only warm - blooded sea turtle -- is able to withstand colder waters than other species			1
this has allowed it to become the most geographically dispersed reptile , spotted off the coasts of @entity34 and @entity35 in the north , to @entity37 and the southern tip of @entity39			1
but despite its wide spread across the world 's oceans , leatherback populations have plummeted in recent decades			1
the impact of commercial fishing , the poaching of their eggs and other hazards saw their numbers drop by an estimated 80 % during the 1980s and 1990s , and today the species is classified as critically endangered			1
on the beaches of @entity56 on @entity39 's west coast , however , there are encouraging signs			1
here , an important conservation project run by local @entity60 ( @entity61 , or @entity62 ) is attempting to save this ancient giant from extinction			1
watch : new research to save @entity39 's leopards @entity56 is home to the world 's largest nesting population of leatherbacks , with an estimated population of between 15,000 and 41,000 females using its warm , tropical beaches as a place to incubate their eggs			1
as @entity61 's @entity79 explains , if you know where to look , the man - sized leatherback can be glimpsed on a nightly basis for months at a time			1
" there is , from october to march or april , perhaps every day some turtles coming to the beach to lay their eggs and go back to sea , " she said			1
after mating with a male just off shore , the female leatherback will wait for nightfall to head for the beach , dig a shallow pit in the sand , and deposit her eggs -- as many as 150 at a time			1

her work on land done , she returns to the sea			0
@entity105 says that for every thousand eggs laid , perhaps only one turtle will survive to maturity			1
some of the 10cm long hatchlings will be unable to dig their way to the surface to make it to the surf , and suffocate in the nests			0
others are easily picked off by crabs , dogs , seabirds and other predators			0
@entity61 's program involves collecting data on the nesting patterns of the leatherback populations , and operating hatcheries			2
in these projects , eggs from the wild are allowed to hatch in a fenced - off location , before the hatchlings are introduced to the ocean , in order to improve their chances of survival			2
the organization also works to educate the public about turtle conservation			2
" there is a lot of threat for young turtles , " said @entity105			0
" the most important are human threats , because activities , sounds , lights are ... a real problem for turtles			0
" watch : combating @entity39 's rhino hunters she said it was important to minimize human activity around beach areas used by nesting leatherbacks			1
the nests could be easily crushed by vehicles or beachgoers , and the noise they produced could scare off nesting females			0
furthermore , because both female turtles and their hatchlings navigate their way to the ocean using the bright moonlight reflecting off the breaking surf , artificial lights could disorientate them and send them towards danger			0
although leatherbacks have not traditionally been prized for their meat , their eggs have been highly sought in various parts of the world as a protein source , an aphrodisiac or for use in traditional medicines			2
@entity56 was no exception , said @entity105			2
" people used to eat turtle eggs , but only in [ their ] family , " said @entity105			2
" they take just a few eggs for children and wife			0
" see also : @entity185 orphanage takes in elephant babies @entity61 has encouraged locals not to eat or sell the eggs , stressing the greater economic value to the community in assisting conservation efforts			2
" turtles can be an important tourist product and if they disappear ... tourists may disappear with it			0
it 's a source of money			0
" even if the leatherback survives the hatching process , it faces many more dangers on its journey			0
large numbers are killed each year on the long - lines or drift nets of commercial fishermen , in which the animals can become snared and drown within 40 minutes			0
pollution also poses a threat : floating plastic bags look a lot like the jellyfish they rely on as their main food source , and have been found in the digestive systems of about half of the leatherbacks studied in recent times			0
if they can avoid these hazards , however , these solitary giants can live to be over 50 years old			0
the males of the species may never return to land after surviving the arduous hatching process			0
remarkably , though , when it comes time to lay their own eggs , the female of the species will typically cross the ocean to return to precisely the same beach where she may have hatched 15 years earlier .			1

the leatherback is the world 's largest turtle , and one of the largest species of reptile
it is critically endangered , having suffered a population decline of about 80 % in recent decades
the beaches of @entity56 , in west @entity39 , are the most popular spot for females to lay their eggs
aventures @entity60 operates a conservation project to help the hatchlings survive
