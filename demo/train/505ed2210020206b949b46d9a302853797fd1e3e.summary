-- the tragic news from @entity2 managed to become even more shocking monday when the regime issued an unprecedented threat to use chemical and biological weapons			1
the warning , which came couched in deceptively reassuring language , makes it clearer than ever that the world can not afford to act merely as an interested spectator as @entity2 unravels in a tangle of shrapnel and blood			2
@entity2 had always denied that it owned any chemical or biological weapons			1
but the denial ended this week when @entity17 spokesman @entity16 issued his peculiarly veiled threat			2
" no chemical or biological weapons will ever be used , " @entity16 said before flashing the thunderbolt of an exception : " unless @entity2 is exposed to external aggression			1
" the weapons , he said , acknowledging their existence for the first time , are under supervision of the @entity2 armed forces			1
@entity2 says it has weapons of mass destruction in case of foreign attack the regime of @entity2 president @entity34 has long described the uprising against his rule as a terrorist revolt and a " foreign conspiracy			1
" @entity16 himself promptly described the opposition as the work of foreign extremists , conceivably synonymous with the " external aggression " that would qualify for chemical attack under these new rules of engagement			2
the @entity46 has placed most of its efforts on diplomacy , even while @entity34 's forces have killed more than 15,000 protesters			1
diplomacy has gone nowhere , but the fighting continues unabated , and the humanitarian catastrophe escalates			0
as with every other uprising in the @entity57 world , with the exception of @entity59 , @entity54 has tried to play delicately , seeking a nuanced approach that keeps it from taking center stage in the conflict , speaking out from the sidelines and gently moving events along			0
if anyone needed more information about the stakes and the urgency in this conflict , the latest threat provides it			0
@entity46 combat forces should stay out of the conflict , for now , unless @entity2 unleashes chemical weapons directly or indirectly			1
but the @entity46 should play a much more active role helping overthrow @entity34			1
it 's time for @entity54 and its allies to throw their support more forcefully behind elements of the opposition whose ideas most closely match the @entity83 's views on democracy , equality and rule of law			2
opinion : preparing for @entity34 's exit many have rightly worried about who makes up the opposition			1
there is no question that elements of @entity95 and other religious extremists are fighting with the rebels			0
but the opposition also includes members whose views more closely align with the ideals of democratic pluralism that are consistent with @entity46 's			1
@entity2 is a diverse country , with large @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 minorities			2
@entity46 can stand back and hope for the best , or it can move forward and start financing and providing substantial intelligence and logistical support to the opposition members who , to the best of @entity54 's knowledge , might uphold the right values once in power			1
there are no guarantees , but members of the opposition who have more resources become stronger inside their movement			0
@entity46 could help fortify ideological moderates by helping them in their fight			2
as we have just seen in @entity59 , moderate forces can benefit from the influence they acquire when they enlist foreign support			0
this is not to deny that extremists could end up gaining power in @entity2			1
but that only makes it more important to help steer the conflict towards the best possible outcome			0
as @entity34 's grip loosens , what could come next ? consider the alternatives			2
@entity138 could survive , or the civil war could grind on for years			0
it now looks as if @entity34 is losing ground , but other regimes have survived strong uprisings			2
if @entity34 's rule survives , it will mark a defeat for the @entity2 people , for @entity46 's friends in @entity149 and for @entity46 allies throughout the region			1
it would constitute a major victory for tyranny , a triumph for @entity156 and for @entity157			0
a victory for @entity34 would fortify and embolden the forces in the @entity160 that oppose peace between @entity162 and @entity163 , those who despise the @entity46 and the @entity83 , the enemies of secularism , of equality for women and of ethnic and religious tolerance			1
this is a war for dominance over the region , not just for one regime 's survival			2
@entity138 , despite his @entity175 education and modern tailored suits , has aligned himself with and actively supported the worst most anti-democratic , retrograde forces in the region			0
for decades , his friends have sowed terror around the world			0
@entity2 helped transfer thousands of @entity156 missiles to @entity157 , a disruptive @entity184 , rejectionist organization whose manifesto declares " our struggle will end only when this entity ( @entity162 ) is obliterated			2
" @entity162 is already deeply worried about @entity34 handing chemical weapons to @entity157 , which has 50,000 conventionally armed missiles aimed at @entity162 and managed to fire 4,000 rockets at @entity162 civilian targets in the 2006 war			1
the possibility that the fighting could spread throughout the region is frighteningly easy to envision			0
@entity156 , @entity34 's closest ally , has been held responsible for masterminding terrorist bombings as far away as @entity199			2
its current defense minister , along with the former president and former foreign minister , in fact , are targets of an @entity206 arrest warrant for one of those attacks			0
and we 're not even mentioning the nuclear issue , which exponentially increases the stakes			0
faces of the @entity213 now that @entity34 's regime has introduced the option that major mass - casualty weapons could enter the conflict , it has eliminated any doubts about the need to bring an end to the @entity223 's brutal rule			1
it has also highlighted the importance of helping establish a responsible government in its aftermath			0
according to the independent @entity232 , " @entity2 has one of the largest and most sophisticated chemical weapons programs in the world and may also possess offensive biological weapons			1
" its arsenal contains nerve agents , cyanide , mustard gas and other weapons , along with the capability to fire them with scud missiles , anti-tank rockets and anti-aircraft missiles			0
when @entity46 intelligence analysts saw military activity around @entity2 's chemical stockpile sites , @entity54 warned @entity34 that using them would " cross a serious red line			1
" it 's time now for more clarity			0
after @entity2 warned that @entity251 might resort to chemical weapons , @entity250 foreign minister @entity249 called the threat " monstrous , " and @entity255 foreign secretary @entity254 called it " unacceptable			1
" the @entity256 declared itself " seriously concerned			0
" president @entity257 said it would be a " tragic mistake " to use the weapons			0
there 's no need for subtlety			0
@entity138 should hear that @entity263 will intervene directly if he uses chemical or biological weapons or if he gives them to his dangerous allies			1
at the same time , @entity54 and its allies should make a concerted and decisive push to help the @entity2 people remove @entity34 from power			1
