-- we 're in @entity3 's famous wine country -- shopping for frying pans			1
we 're tooling around @entity6 , @entity3 , the small picturesque town in the heart of @entity8 , taking in the tasting rooms , restaurants and antique shops scattered around the @entity12			1
my 23 - year - old daughter , @entity15 , is excited because she scores a cast - iron frying pan for $ 15			1
i 'm excited because it is a perfect sunny fall day and i 'm spending it with my husband and daughter			2
we 're staying in @entity20 near @entity21 at the recently renovated @entity22 55			2
it 's a great location , but we opt to head out of the city to @entity8 , about an hour from @entity20 , which is home to some 1,800 growers and 450 wineries			1
@entity8 , just 30 miles north of @entity20 's @entity27 , is closer to the city than @entity29 and much bigger -- more than 1,500 square miles -- roughly the size of @entity31			1
if you think wine country -- especially @entity8 -- is just for grown - ups ( at least those over 21 ) think again			1
there are plenty of places to bike , hike and kayak on the @entity42			2
there are many kid - friendly wineries too , complete with toy chests , picnic grounds and more , says @entity47 , mom to 11 - year - old twins and founder of @entity8 - based www.beautiful-places.com			1
beautiful places rents villas here and in @entity29 and can also arrange special activities for your gang			2
( @entity57 in a vineyard perhaps ? ) at the @entity61 winery you can take a tram tour of the organic farm or sip wine while the kids get a lesson at the @entity67 where " good " bugs ( ladybugs , praying mantis ) are raised to eat all the bad bugs			1
@entity72 offers horseback rides and the @entity74 has lots of animals			1
@entity47 notes that farms in the area invite families to watch as cheese or honey is made or give then an opportunity to try their hand at milking a cow , digging for potatoes or picking fruit			2
you 'll find farmer 's markets each day in at least one of the towns			2
" we love the @entity8 farmer 's market on tuesday nights in summer in the square , " @entity47 says			1
" families bring a picnic dinner and listen to live music			2
there are two playground areas in the park too			2
" @entity101 , home to the @entity102 , is a good place to hike			1
for a more exotic kind of fun , head to @entity107 , an @entity109 inspired wildlife preserve where you can see animals in their natural habitat or take teens to learn about racecar driving at the @entity116			1
if your gang loves the comic strip " peanuts , " you wo n't want to miss the @entity120 in @entity121			2
for younger kids , @entity122 has a steam railroad , a @entity125 and a carousel			1
some wine tasting for the adults will likely be on the agenda too			2
we start our tasting at @entity132			0
do we like the @entity133 ( with its orange aromas ) or the @entity135 ( with hints of butterscotch and honeysuckle ) ? we taste a @entity139 ( aromas of blueberry ) and a @entity142 ( hints of black licorice )			0
i love them all but my daughter warns me to pace myself ; it is , after all , just 11 a.m. ! we head around the corner to @entity150 where i love the @entity151			0
i think it would be good with @entity153			0
i 'm learning to just take one sip			0
next we stop in at @entity157 's @entity156 where we find every variety of candy ( @entity161 dinner gummies , sour grape " pucker powder , " nerds , sweet tarts , etc. ) , old - fashioned toys ( juggle balls , a mr. @entity168 doll ) and scrumptious gelato ( dark chocolate peanut butter or pistachio )			0
lunchtime already ? we head to a local landmark @entity174 where we eat lunch in a grape arbor feasting on just - made curry chicken salad and the best bean salad i 've ever eaten			0
we indulge in a ginger cookie for dessert			0
a group of cyclists is eating lunch too , which makes me feel guilty that we 're touring in a car rather than getting some much - needed exercise			0
just down the road is @entity188 , which is owned by @entity189 who also owns @entity190 , one of @entity3 's largest wineries			1
an attorney , @entity189 began growing grapes on land he 'd purchased in 1974			0
eight years later , he produced his first wine , which ultimately won kudos and awards			0
our " wine educator , " @entity199 , is so passionate about wine that he plans to enroll in graduate school next fall at @entity203			0
@entity199 is already an accomplished and prize - winning home vintner whose enthusiasm is infectious , as he explains how all of these wines are grown on the hillsides			1
sipping our wine , we get a rare behind - the - scenes peak at the operation -- the oak barrels where the juice is pressed out of the grapes , the lab where the science of winemaking is conducted to test sugar composition			0
too soon we have to head back to the city to meet some friends for a last - night - in - @entity20 dinner			0
we opt for a new hip spot we think the twentysomethings in the gang will like -- @entity228 , located in the @entity230 area and known for its beers and house - cured meats			0
we feast on mini corndogs , @entity237 salumi , mortadella , salami , fall squash and goat cheese pizza			0
not only is the food delicious but it 's also affordable			0
did i mention dessert ? warm pear crumble , caramel pot de creme or chocolate spice doughnut with peanut butter curry ice cream			0
the twentysomethings love the place ... just as my daughter loved our day in @entity8 -- and her new frying pan			1
it 's nice to see you can still take the kids -- even when they are over 21			1
