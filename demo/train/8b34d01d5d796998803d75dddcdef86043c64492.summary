-- in the smoggy cradle of @entity4 's industrial heartland , a heaving freight train gets set to depart along a modern incarnation of the legendary @entity7 trading route			1
this historic passageway was once worn into a dense chain of dusty trails by caravans of horses and camels carrying merchants and their many wares between continental @entity16 and @entity17			0
today it takes the form of a series of transnational rail tracks transporting the latest in electronic products and computer parts			2
starting in the bustling mega city of @entity26 , southwest @entity4 , the 11,179 - kilometer ( 6,946 - mile ) network stretches across six countries and vast unpopulated expanses all the way to @entity30 , @entity31			1

" if ( the city ) wants to go global , the railway serves an important role , " @entity34 added			2
@entity26 rising for many companies with factories in fast - growing @entity26 , transferring items via rail to markets in @entity17 can be easier and quicker than sea freight from one of @entity4 's coastal ports			1
@entity34 points out that train journeys take just 16 days , comparing favorably to the more lengthy shipping routes where the costs and time of transporting cargo to the coast must also be added			0
since the rail network opened in 2011 ( as a joint venture between track operator @entity64 , the @entity65 and the state railways of @entity4 , @entity39 and @entity40 ) an increasing number of multinationals have taken advantage of the facility , @entity34 said			1
@entity70 computer giant @entity69 claims to have shipped more than 4 million notebook computers to @entity17 by train during this period			0
as more industry heads towards @entity4 's vast interior -- and cities like @entity26 expand , creating greater wealth and consumer spending power -- many observers believe rail freight will become an even more appealing cargo - transport option			1

" " it 's the only way to avoid the long sea routes			0
airplanes are very expensive ( and ) road is out of the question ( because ) the volumes are too small			0
" " rail transportation , " he added can be " a very efficient way , and a fairly fast way , of moving large volumes of freight from @entity4 to @entity17			1
" @entity103 shift while this contemporary route ( which plots a more northern course than its historic @entity7 counterpart ) has been in operation for two years now , rail routes between @entity16 and @entity17 are far from a new development			1
the @entity110 has been shifting goods and passengers between @entity113 and @entity114 on @entity40 's @entity115 for just under a century , linking up with tracks in northern @entity4 and @entity117 along the way			1
in time , @entity83 sees the potential for even more rail integration between the continents			2
he points to the @entity123 tunnel project ( due to open later this year ) that will marry tracks underneath the @entity124 , connecting @entity16 and @entity125 in the process			0

this intergovernmental project has the backing of 22 @entity137 nations and proposes lines that would connect @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity125 to southern @entity17 , as well as a @entity137 network that could theoretically extend all the way from @entity146 to @entity17 via @entity4			1
a north - south corridor stretching from @entity40 through @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 all the way to the @entity153 port of @entity154 in @entity143 is also cited by the @entity129 group as a possibility			2
keeping track when it comes to actually building these lines , however , the reality is infinitely more complex than simply plotting the routes and laying down tracks -- as the @entity130 project has discovered since it was agreed in 2006			0
according to @entity166 , a rail historian and author of the forthcoming book " to the @entity170 , " all manner of operational challenges must first be overcome			2
" individual countries tend to use different styles , technologies , signaling systems and gauges , " @entity166 explained			0
" that means creating a link across several nations is problematic ... and incredibly expensive			0
" " then there is also the politics			0
can you go through northern @entity125 or @entity182 or @entity143 ? " but that 's not to say they ( trains ) do n't have benefits			0
there is fantastic potential as they are a relatively green and sustainable mode of transport and can take vast loads with just a couple of people driving a train , " he added			2

he highlights how the @entity26 to @entity30 route has already overcome some of the standardization challenges by having cargo containers transferred to cars with new gauges at relevant border crossings to meet varying national track requirements			1
" if you can simplify it , if you can unify customs agreements and if you can have a standard operating system with rules agreed by all those along the route , " he said , then railways are " an extremely efficient way of moving large numbers of people and freight from one population center to the other			0

a vast rail network links @entity26 in @entity4 to @entity30 in @entity31
the network has echoes of the *famous* @entity7 trading route
the railway goes through @entity4 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity31
