federal prosecutors were preparing charges sunday against the surviving suspect in the @entity4 bombings even as authorities said they believed he and his brother were allegedly preparing to carry out more attacks when their plans were disrupted			1
authorities have not said publicly what charges will be filed against @entity12 , but a @entity14 official , who has been briefed on the case , told @entity16 he will face federal terrorism charges and possibly state murder charges			1
@entity19 , 19 , remains in serious but stable condition with a gunshot wound to the side of the neck , a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity16 on sunday			1
it is unclear whether @entity19 was wounded during his capture or an earlier shootout with police that left his older brother -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
" he 's not in a condition to be interrogated at this time , " @entity38 police commissioner @entity37 told reporters at a news conference on sunday afternoon			2
however , another senior federal official who has been briefed on the investigation told @entity16 's @entity44 that @entity19 has communicated in writing with officials several times			1
even as prosecutors worked to put together a case against @entity19 , @entity37 said he believed the brothers were planning another attack before a shootout with police disrupted their plans			1
" we have reason to believe , based upon the evidence that was found at the scene -- the explosions , the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the fire power -- that they were going to attack other individuals , " @entity37 said sunday on @entity55 ' " @entity54			1
" he did not say whether investigators had identified a specific target			2
authorities believe the brothers bought bomb components locally , but their guns came from elsewhere , another federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity16			1
the official , who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case , said authorities are trying to trace the guns			1
@entity19 was captured friday night , days after he and his brother allegedly planted two bombs near the finish line of the @entity4			2
the blasts killed three people and wounded more than 170 others			1
authorities virtually shut down @entity38 and some of its suburbs as part of a manhunt after authorities say the brothers went on a rampage late thursday and early friday			1
the brothers allegedly hurled explosives at police after killing @entity93 police officer @entity92 and hijacking a car			1
what 's next for the suspect ? there are questions about whether @entity19 will ever be able to talk given the nature of his wound , sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , said sunday on @entity104 's " @entity103			1
" " it does n't mean he ca n't communicate , but right now i think he 's in a condition where we ca n't get any information from him at all , " said @entity101 , a member of the @entity105			0
the government has invoked the public safety exception in the case , a designation that allows investigators to question @entity19 without reading him his @entity118 rights and without a lawyer present , said another @entity14 official , also speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason			1
secretary of defense @entity124 told reporters on a flight to @entity128 that he has not seen any intelligence that linked the brothers to any terrorist organization , but it was still early in the investigation			1
but @entity37 told @entity16 that he was confident that the brothers were " the two major actors in the violence that occurred			1
" " i told the people of @entity38 that they can rest easily , that the two people who were committing these vicious attacks are either dead or arrested , and i still believe that , " he said sunday			1
the sentiment was echoed by @entity140 police chief @entity139			0
" from what i know right now , these two acted together and alone , " he said			0
" i think we have to be ever vigilant , and we 're learning as we go along , but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- i think we got our guys			0
" hints of a radical ? while investigators piece together the actions of the brothers in the months and days before the marathon bombings , there appear to be hints that the elder @entity19 was becoming radical			1
the @entity19 family hails from the @entity155 republic of @entity156 and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s			0
the two brothers were born in @entity160 , authorities said			2
profiles of the two suspects an @entity164 official said saturday agents interviewed @entity19 in 2011 at the request of the @entity155 government			2
the @entity164 said @entity155 claimed he was a follower of radical @entity168 and a strong believer and that he had changed drastically since 2010			0
but a @entity171 official and a law enforcement source said sunday the @entity155 government 's request was vague			1
the lack of specifics limited how much the @entity164 was able to investigate @entity19 , the law enforcement official said			2
@entity19 apparently became increasingly radical in the last three or four years , according to an analysis of his social media accounts and the accounts of family members			0
but so far , there is no evidence of active association with international jihadist groups			2
in august 2012 , soon after returning from his visit to @entity155 , the elder @entity19 created a @entity187 channel with links to a number of videos			0
two videos under a category labeled " terrorists " were deleted			0
it 's not clear when or by whom			0
a @entity16 analysis of the @entity187 channel has established that one deleted video featured a militant named @entity199 , whose real name was @entity201			1
@entity16 has located a video clip of the footage in question			1
@entity155 security services killed @entity201 in december during an assault on an apartment in @entity208 , the capital of the @entity155 @entity210 republic of @entity211			0
@entity201 led a small group in @entity211 that had links to the main @entity215 militant group in the region , @entity217			0
older suspect in @entity38 bombings grew increasingly religious , analysis shows separately , a @entity171 intelligence source told @entity16 that investigators are looking into whether @entity19 had any connections with the group , known in @entity225 as @entity226			1
the source says @entity19 had several computer links to the group in his social media activities , and investigators are looking into the possibility that he received " operational plans " from this group			2
rebels who call themselves @entity237 of the @entity238 of @entity211 issued a statement sunday that appeared to distance the group from the @entity38 bombings , saying they are not fighting the @entity171			2
" we are at war with @entity155 , " it said			0
the statement also said that children are never targets of the group			0
' he was just relaxed ' as an army of officers hunted for the suspects in monday 's marathon bombings , @entity12 acted like any other college sophomore			1
he was on the campus of @entity255 every day after the attack until late thursday , a university official told @entity16			1
@entity19 attended classes and went to the gym and dorm parties while much of @entity38 was at a tense standstill			0
on tuesday , he and a fellow student were at the campus gym when the bombings came up in discussion			2
@entity266 said he expressed his shock about the attack , telling @entity19 that it was the type of thing you hear about in @entity272 or @entity273 , not @entity38			2
he said @entity19 responded : " yeah , tragedies happen man			0
like these things happen around the world			0
" a student at the school told the @entity281 she saw @entity19 wednesday night at a party that was attended by some of his friends from intramural soccer			0
" he was just relaxed , " she said , asking the paper not to print her name			0
at the dorm where @entity19 lived , students joked thursday as they viewed the @entity164 photos of the bombing suspects on television , a senior who lived in that dorm told the @entity281			0
" we made a joke like , that could be @entity12 , " @entity295 said			0
" but then we thought it just could n't be him			0
" the campus , which was closed during the search for the bombing suspects , reopened sunday morning			0
moment of silence @entity38 , meanwhile , is trying to return to semblance of normalcy with some streets and business reopening			0
federal investigators on sunday were lifting crime scene tape and barriers erected during the investigation into the bombings near the marathon 's finish line on @entity313			1
people throughout @entity315 are being urged to observe a moment of silence monday at 2:50 p.m. , exactly one week after the @entity4 bombings			1
of those injured in the marathon bombings , 55 remain hospitalized , including three in critical condition , according to a @entity16 count			1
doctors , meanwhile , said sunday that they are " cautiously optimistic " that a @entity315 transit officer wounded in a shootout with the alleged @entity4 bombers will recover			1
@entity325 , 33 , remains in critical condition at @entity327 in @entity328 , said dr. @entity329 , a surgeon who operated on the officer			2
there was life before the bombings , and then life after			2
" we are all scattered in the pain and horror of this week 's violence , " @entity38 's archbishop , cardinal @entity335 , told parishioners during sunday services at the @entity338			0
" some of those here were among those injured			0
but everyone has been affected			0
