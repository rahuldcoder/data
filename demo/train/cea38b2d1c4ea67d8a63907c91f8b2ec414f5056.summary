editor 's note : @entity2 is the new president and ceo of the @entity4			1
@entity2 says the 100 - year - old @entity4 has an ambitious agenda for civil and human rights			1
( @entity7 ) -- thursday the @entity8 passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and for legalized segregation			2
it arrived more than a hundred years late , but better late than never			1
members of the @entity15 @entity14 are expected to pass a similar resolution , and when they do , the bipartisan resolution will acknowledge our nation 's need to take a historic leap out of the shameful past of racial discrimination and toward a future that promises all citizens full access to the legal protections laid out in the @entity15 @entity28			2
but we must go beyond the civil rights guaranteed in the @entity28 and advocate for the human rights that will assure that @entity15 's promise is realized for all			1
while our @entity28 mandates equality , for example , there is no constitutional guarantee for an education , let alone a good education			1
the fight for good schools is a struggle for our human rights			1
some have opined that there is no longer a need for the @entity4 and that we as a society are post-racial because of the election of our first black president			1
but we can not be post-racial until we are post-racism			2
the case of @entity50 , an @entity51 man set for execution who we believe was wrongly convicted , is an exemplar of the disparities that still rock our nation ( see @entity57 )			2
@entity50 was convicted of killing a police officer and has spent 18 years on death row			1
there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime and seven of the nine witnesses recanted or contradicted their testimony			2
his case has sparked an outcry from both proponents and opponents of the death penalty including former @entity72 director @entity71 and conservative presidential candidate @entity73			0
yet our laws do n't allow him a new trial to reexamine the evidence that points to his innocence			0
african - americans are disproportionately represented on death row			0
of the 3,500 people on death row , about 42 percent are black , and virtually all are poor			0
studies underscore that it is race and class , more than guilt , that determines whether a defendant , once convicted , is sentenced to death			2
the statistics paint an ongoing portrait of inequality			0
unemployment for @entity51 remains twice that of whites and studies show there is no scientific rationale -- neither education nor experience -- that explains the gap			2
in some @entity51 cities , 50 percent of school - aged black men drop out of school and as much as 50 percent of young black men are unemployed			0
now , as we prepare to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the @entity4 in @entity107 from july 11 - 16 ( @entity108 ) , we recognize that despite our many accomplishments , we have a long path ahead to right the inequity that still racks our nation			1
prompted by the riots in @entity119 's hometown of @entity120 , @entity121 , where a mob of whites containing many of the town 's " best citizens , " raged for two days , killed and wounded scores of african - americans , and drove thousands from the city , a multiracial group of intellectuals , journalists and activists gathered in a small @entity107 apartment to launch the @entity4 and fight lynching 's and mob violence			1
history has shown the efficacy of our tried and true approach : dreaming bold dreams , breaking them down into incremental steps and ultimately achieving big victories			0
and our triumphs strengthen the fabric of democracy in @entity15			0
when , after a multidecade - long struggle , we ended the cruel practice of lynching , not only @entity51 benefited but also @entity145 , who were , after black people , the likeliest targets of lynchings in the @entity149			2
similarly , our lawsuit against 15 banks for steering african - americans into the predatory loans that have devastated neighborhoods today would force transparency and accountability that would benefit all @entity51			0
the election of president @entity158 is the result of a decades - long fight for political inclusion			0
his victory may have come as a bolt from the blue for some , but at the @entity4 , we know that our century of hard work helped pave the way for the junior senator from @entity121 , a black man , to win the @entity172			1
if our unofficial motto , " registration , mobilization , education , " sounds familiar , it is because that deceptively simple formula informed the successful election campaign of @entity158			2
the @entity4 has always been about the present and the future , and we choose to focus on solutions , rather than just bemoan the hard work to be done : this does n't indicate denial , or ineffectiveness , we simply prefer action over rhetoric			1
now , we see @entity119 's radical determination to extend the rights of the @entity28 to all @entity51 citizens as the @entity4 's guiding light			1
we do n't often hear the words " radical " and " @entity4 " in the same sentence but i like the proximity : we 've kicked off our next hundred years with actions that might have been perceived as " radical " at our founding a century ago -- from ending the death penalty in @entity200 to successfully passing anti-racial profiling legislation in @entity202 and other states			1
being radical is not new for me			2
i was born out of resistance to @entity205 when my mom and dad married despite their union being illegal in many states			0
my dad , @entity211 , was disowned for marrying a black woman and was used to being the only white guy thrown out of the diner for trying to integrate the lunch counter			0
my mom , @entity216 , was an early activist in the @entity217			0
my generation , was told the civil rights battles had largely been won -- " go forth young man and make money , enjoy your life and be successful " -- but we woke up to find ourselves the most murdered and incarcerated generation in history			1
so i chose to be an activist , starting at 14 with voter registration drives			0
i was later kicked out of @entity228 for protesting -- ultimately graduating and becoming a @entity230 scholar			0
during that forced hiatus , i journeyed south where i learned firsthand about the tenacity and pain of southern racism and poverty			0
i already knew well its northern urban counterpart			0
i also learned that we could win -- which filled me with a sense of hope for the nation and confidence in our ability to impact the world			0
our many victories and the election of our first black president fuels my optimism over the bright future of the civil and human rights movement			1
it is spiced with a dash of pride , too			0
thanks , in part to the work of the @entity4 , my 3 - year - old daughter and her girlfriends will grow up in an @entity15 where the idea of a woman president -- or a black man , or an @entity263 woman , or a @entity265 man -- is n't likely to be " radical " at all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity4 formed in *response* to lynchings and race riots
he says organization still has a " radical " agenda after 100 years
@entity2 : we must move beyond civil rights to human rights
he says organization is fighting inequities in education and criminal justice
