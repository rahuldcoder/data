the woman at the center of the @entity3 enrollment site , @entity5 administrator @entity4 on tuesday was the first government official to testify before @entity6 since the government 's health insurance exchange went live on october 1			1
after nearly three hours of questions from both @entity11 and @entity12 on the @entity13 , here 's what we learned : 1			1
finally , an apology after four very tumultuous weeks of open enrollment , @entity4 became the first government official to publicly apologize for the rocky rollout of @entity19			1
@entity4 : sorry for problems , but system working " we know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage and to the millions of @entity26 who have attempted to use @entity19 to shop and enroll in health care coverage , i want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should , " @entity4 said during her opening remarks			1
president @entity31 has admitted his frustration and health secretary @entity33 has expressed regret , but on tuesday , @entity4 accepted responsibility for the site 's failures			1
" obviously , i 'm accountable for this , " she said later in the hearing			0
but @entity4 was insistent that the site is not beyond repair			0
" i want to ensure you that @entity19 can and will be fixed and we are working around the clock to deliver the shopping experience that you deserve , " she said			0
" we are seeing improvements each week , and as we said publicly , by the end of november , the experience on the site will be smooth for the vast majority of users			0
" despite @entity4 's claims of responsibility for the program 's failures , none of the members of the committee signaled that she should be reprimanded			2
on the other hand , more than 30 @entity59 republicans and at least two prominent @entity11 members of the @entity61 have called for @entity33 ' resignation			1
why @entity33 will keep her job ... for now 2			0
insurance plans are being canceled no fewer than 10 republicans on the @entity13 held up or cited letters sent to constituents saying that their health insurance plans were going away			2
most of these legislators quickly followed up with references to a talking point at the center of @entity31 's pitch to consumers both before and after the @entity3 was passed			1
" if you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan , " the president repeated in speeches , weekly addresses and even the @entity79			1
at tuesday 's hearing , @entity11 called that promise misleading			1
keep your plan ? maybe not opinion : canceled health plan is a good thing @entity4 acknowledged that while some insurance companies had decided to stop offering certain plans on the individual market , the @entity3 did not force them to make that decision , and consumers whose plans have been canceled now have more comprehensive plans available to them			1
@entity96 : obamacare pricier for some individual buyers " if , in fact , the issuer has decided to change the plan -- it did n't have to , " @entity4 said			0
" plans were grandfathered in in 2010 if they did n't make significant changes in cost - sharing and this sort of thing , they could keep the plans that they had			0
" companies that decide to create new plans , @entity4 continued , must conform to new mandates under the @entity3			1
these include a ban on rejections due to preexisting medical conditions , and new mandated benefits such as hospitalization , emergency services and maternity care			2
in response to repeated @entity11 questioning , @entity4 recommended that consumers who lose their coverage explore the options available to them on the new federal exchange			1
" they can call the call center today and we will help them , " @entity4 said			2
" they can go online and if they 're not successful we can help them through the call center			2
we also have people in their individual markets that can help them in person			0
so there are more methods than just the website			2
and i think that 's important			2
initial enrollment will be low since the @entity3 passed in 2010 , @entity31 administration officials have pointed to the initial months of @entity147 ' health reform implementation as a predictor of how the nation - wide rollout might go			1
while repeatedly emphasizing that her agency would n't be releasing any enrollment information until mid-november , @entity4 used this example again on tuesday as one reason why the first round of numbers might be lower than expected			0
" we expect the initial number to be small , " @entity4 said			0
" and i think you 've seen that in our projections , and that was the @entity147 experience as well			1
" later @entity4 expanded on that explanation saying , " the @entity147 experience was very slow initially and then it started to ramp up over time			1
we expect the same type of projections			0
" in recent days , @entity59 officials have cited a study in the @entity168 that found the vast majority of the consumers who enrolled in the first month of the @entity147 health insurance exchanges were @entity172 eligible			1
the study found that just 123 premium - paying enrollees signed up in @entity147 during the first month , compared with 10,000 people who signed up for @entity172 or plans with no premiums			2
the partisan gulf remains wide -- and democrats are standing by @entity3 as @entity11 after @entity11 read testimonials from their constituents about the disastrous effects the @entity3 is having on insurance policies , and the tortured experiences many have had trying to enroll online , the stories coming from @entity12 were quite different			1
supporters of the law acknowledged that the first month of open enrollment had been less than pleasant , but the stories they recounted had happy endings			2
@entity190 @entity189 rep. @entity189 told the story of @entity192 , who waited three hours to purchase insurance online , but was happy with his insurance in the end			2
" the good news for mr. striker is he 's saving $ 6,000 as a result of being able to apply for the plan , " @entity189 said			0
" so it 's unacceptable for anyone to have to wait even three hours , and even though he says that he would have waited all day given the result he got , what we want is for everyone to experience the $ 6,000 savings -- maybe not that much , maybe more			0
" rep. @entity207 , a @entity189 from @entity208 , used his time to list off statistics demonstrating the successes of open - enrollment in his state			0
the most passionate defense of the health care law came from @entity217 @entity12 rep. @entity216 , who chastised @entity11 for trying to kill the law rather than working to improve it , as @entity12 had done when faced with health reform they opposed , president @entity223 's @entity222 " we lost the policy fight , and what did we do ? we went back to our districts and we told our seniors although we voted no , we personally believe -- and will work with the @entity223 administration to make it work , that 's what we did , " @entity216 said , standing from his chair to face his colleagues			1
" and how many of you stood up to do that ? none			0
capacity is improving in a statement that galled many republicans on the committee , @entity4 said that despite all of its hiccups and inconsistencies , @entity19 is currently functioning			0
" the system is working , " she said			0
" we 'd like for it to work better and that 's what we 've committed to do by the end of november			0
" will the young and healthy use healthcare.gov ? security hole found in @entity3 website for weeks , administration officials have said that performance is improving every day , and on a conference call with reporters on tuesday afternoon @entity5 officials gave an update on consumers ' ability to create an account on @entity19 , a major bottleneck in the site 's early days			1
" now we are able to process nearly 17,000 registrants per hour , or five per second , with almost no error rates , " @entity5 communications director @entity262 said on the call			0
" so that 's the number of individuals who are completing that full account creation process , that first step in the application			0
