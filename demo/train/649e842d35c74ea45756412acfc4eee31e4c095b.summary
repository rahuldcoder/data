-- she 's the antithesis of the typical fashion designer , preferring to step away from the adulation of shows and flashy parties , yet from behind the scenes , @entity6 has a huge impact on the world of fashion			1
preferring to stay behind the scenes , @entity6 has built up a fashion empire			1
@entity6 has taken a unique path to become the name and impetus behind a worldwide brand that has developed what fashion brands can achieve beyond the catwalk			1
coming from a wealthy family that supplied luxury goods , she gained a degree in political science from the @entity25 before studying to be a mime artist for six years in the late 1960s and early 1970s			1
" [ it was ] part of the culture of those times " she told @entity0			2
" at that point i like the idea and also in those years you wanted to do anything that was strange or different or eccentric			2
" she fostered many left - wing political and feminist ideas before entering the fashion industry in the 1970s , which was then operating to a different set of values			1
yet she disagrees that there are unmanageable contradictions between her personal values and her work			0
" if you compare with philosophy , [ fashion ] is frivolous , but frivolity may be something good , something that is part of our lives , so i do n't dislike it and what i like is the mix , that in your life you can have serious things , more frivolous ones , " she told @entity0			2
" beauty is not something that is contrary ; it is the right of everybody			0
still i retain the idea of justice and so many other ideas , but that is my work , and it is a contradiction that still is creating me problems , but it 's like this			0
" while @entity68 has expanded its operations across the world and is focusing , like so many other premium companies , on @entity72 , it remains synonymous with wealth and luxury			0
bringing the iconic black @entity68 nylon bag to the market in the early 1990s was just one way in which @entity6 and her husband @entity78 transformed the slightly frumpy family business and helped shift perceptions of what a fashion house could or could not do			1
" i always wanted to do something that was nearly impossible , but obviously it had to be something that made sense to people because if you think about now , the black nylon is everywhere , " she told @entity0			0
from 1980s chic and glamour , @entity6 has never been afraid to take risks with her collections or spark the imagination of the public -- her very first collection was likened to something from @entity96 ; her fall 2009 collection featured fishing waders			1
" i would say that my dreams are doing things that i like and i have fun with			0
my dreams are about how can i do interesting things and make having fun with things , or doing things that are clever or relevant or intelligent			0
so it 's more about what i can do than about how big the company could become , " she said .			0
