@entity0 -- an expatriate corporate detective based in @entity0 and @entity3 , who worked with @entity6 's under - fire @entity5 wing , could soon discover the cost of allegedly falling afoul of @entity5 's often hazy corporate law			1
after more than a year in detention , briton @entity9 and his wife @entity11 , a @entity12 citizen , stand trial in a @entity3 court friday , charged with illegally obtaining private information			1
their 19 - year - old son , who has returned to mainland @entity5 for the trial , says he 's not convinced that , even if the couple is found guilty , they would even have known they were breaking the law			1
@entity9 is a veteran corporate detective -- an investigator , similar to a private detective , but one which sniffs out corporate malfeasance -- who spent more than 20 years as a foreign correspondent with @entity28 , including stints in @entity0 and @entity30			1
@entity31 , the investigations company that @entity11 and @entity9 established , mainly catered to foreign companies and multinationals , such as pharmaceutical giant @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , assisting in assessing corporate risks , conducting background checks and investigating allegations of corruption and fraud			1
it is a business fraught with risks , especially in a country like @entity5 , where even innocuous information is often classified as secret or confidential			1
' fully aware of risks ' the couple was detained on july 10 , 2013 at their @entity3 office , and charged this year with illegally purchasing confidential information -- a serious allegation akin to espionage -- and operating an illegal business			1
on july 10 , @entity5 police raided their home in @entity0			1
it was not until two days later that their son , @entity54 , who was undertaking an internship in @entity57 at that time , managed to establish what befell his parents			2
" they were fully aware of the risks that such a business carries , " he told @entity1			2
" but usually the risks are very small			2
the repercussions do not usually take place on the investigators			2
i guess this time they were definitely caught off guard			0
i think they were caught in the wrong place at the wrong time , and with the wrong client possibly as well			0
" @entity9 believes the case is linked to his father 's client , @entity6 , which is under investigation in @entity5 amid allegations raised by a whistleblower			1
" i would address the cause of the whole event which is @entity6 taking them on and not giving them the information they needed to do their investigations , " he said			2
" it 's effectively misleading them into a dangerous situation			0
" in response to @entity1 's request for comment , @entity6 referred @entity1 back to its july 3 statement			0
@entity6 hired @entity9 's firm " in april 2013 to conduct an investigation following a serious breach of privacy and security related to the company 's @entity5 general manager			1
" " they were not hired to investigate the substance of the allegations of misconduct made by the whistle - blower			0
" @entity5 authorities have not said that the charges are related to the work @entity9 and @entity11 did for the pharmaceutical giant			1
the company has come under scrutiny by @entity5 authorities			1
on may 14 this year , @entity5 police in a report accused @entity6 executives in @entity5 of presiding over a web of corruption and bribery			1
" our @entity5 business is now subject to an ongoing investigation by the @entity5 authorities with which we are fully cooperating , " @entity6 said in its statement			1
" we have also hired an external law firm , @entity119 and @entity120 , to conduct an independent review into what happened in our @entity5 business during this period			1
" last august , @entity9 appeared on @entity5 national television handcuffed and wearing orange prison vest to make an unusual " confession			1
" but his son says the confession may have been made under duress			2
" i was quite upset by it as anyone not used to this sort of situation would be , " he said			0
" i did n't understand why it was done , personally			0
it might have been done because they probably thought it could help to find some leniency			0
but it was quite humiliating			0
" the elder @entity9 and his wife could not be reached for comment			0
are parents innocent or guilty ? " i think it 's highly likely they 're innocent , but the charge , i believe , is obtaining private information and it 's a very gray area of the law , " the couple 's son continues " it 's not been very well established in @entity5			1
it 's theoretically possible they broke that law without even knowing it existed			0
" the @entity5 authorities insist that the case is being prosecuted with all due care			1
" @entity5 's judicial authorities are handling the relevant case according to law , " @entity5 foreign ministry spokesman @entity158 told a daily news briefing in july this year			1
" @entity5 is a country with rule of law			1
" but the younger @entity9 notes a shift in the way @entity5 authorities are handling the case -- he was allowed to visit his parents in jail , for instance			2
" i was told by the @entity173 officer that to have a foreigner make a pre-trial visit to someone has never happened before since @entity5 opened up , " said @entity9 , who is a dual @entity12 - @entity171 citizen			1
the authorities have dropped other , more serious , charges -- initially the couple was charged with buying the information , rather than only obtaining it , and of operating an illegal business			1
further , the trial , which opened friday , will be public , not secret as earlier reported			0
. deteriorating health thirteen months in jail , @entity9 said , had taken its toll on his parents ' health			0
" physically they looked aged , especially my mother , " @entity9 said			0
" she looked a lot younger than her age before this			0
i think she looks her age now			0
and it all boils down to how their health was in prison			0
" his father , he said , suffers from a hernia , as well as compression fractures in his spine			0
the couple are locked in separate cells in a @entity3 prison			0
each shares a cell with six or seven inmates , all foreigners , according to the son			2
" the visit last friday was much more emotional for them than it was for me , " @entity9 says			0
" i did n't feel that happy about being able to visit			0
obviously it 's a positive , but my end goal is to get them released and nothing is going to make me deviate from that path			2
" he plans to attend the friday trial along with a relative and consular representatives from the @entity12 and @entity171 , but says he will not be surprised if his parents are found guilty			0
defense strategy he says he believes it will be easier if his parents plead guilty -- even if they 've done nothing wrong			0
" i 'm hoping it will be a situation where they plead guilty and they go for a mitigation defense strategy , and just try to make it as lenient a sentencing as possible			2
" regardless of the court verdict , @entity9 said that he is proud of them for " holding up as long as they have			2
" and i 'm proud that they 've tried to run such a business			1
their whole standpoint was to cut down on corruption as much as they can wherever they could find it			0
" that was the motivation to do this business			0
it 's a very stressful business so in that sense i 'm very proud of their moral standing			1
