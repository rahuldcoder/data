@entity0 -- this week , @entity2 and @entity3 announced they are pulling their corporate memberships from a conservative group that was behind the spread of " stand your ground " laws like the one highlighted in @entity10 by the @entity12 case			1
the @entity13 , also known as @entity13 , is getting attention lately for its behind the scenes work pushing conservative legislation in the states			1
the group has gotten even more attention since a neighborhood watch volunteer shot and killed unarmed teenager @entity12 last month			2
the man who shot @entity12 , @entity22 , said he acted in self - defense			0
police have n't charged him and legal experts say @entity10 's " stand your ground " law may shield @entity22 from prosecution			2
the @entity30 worked with @entity13 to spread similar laws that are on the books in at least 25 states			1
those laws grow directly out of the @entity36 ethos the @entity30 has championed : " the ethos of individualism , of having a gun , of individuals taking the initiative , " said @entity42 , a political scientist at the @entity43 at @entity44 and at @entity45 who has studied and written about the @entity30 for decades			1
opinion : when soda pop and politics do n't mix less well known is that the @entity30 has also helped @entity13 spread other conservative laws that have nothing to do with gun rights			1
@entity13 drafts and shares model bills with state legislators to promote corporation - friendly and conservative social policy			1
a watchdog group called the @entity58 first documented the @entity30 's role in these bills with @entity13			1
an @entity30 lobbyist , @entity61 , helped shepherd a model bill that requires voters to show a photo id at the polls			2
many conservatives have pushed voter id laws to prevent election fraud			0
many liberals say these laws inhibit voting by minorities			0
@entity61 also helped preside over @entity13 's passage of the model bill that became the basis of @entity76 's immigration law			2
that 's the law that requires police to arrest anyone who can not prove when asked that they entered the @entity81 legally			2
the @entity30 and @entity61 would n't talk with @entity1 , so it 's not known whether @entity61 consulted with other @entity30 officials about the bills on voter id and immigration			2
@entity13 also declined to answer questions			0
@entity87 with the @entity58 said the way @entity13 works , " we know a bill can not be approved as a model bill if the private sector members , like the @entity30 or @entity93 , do n't want it to become a model bill			1
" @entity95 heads an advocacy group called the @entity97			0
he said the @entity30 's role with @entity13 cements his view that the @entity30 is really a base for the conservative movement			1
" people think the @entity30 is just a gun group			1
@entity95 's group has created a cheeky website , " meet the @entity107			0
" it lists the @entity30 's board of directors , and it has a rolling information bar that features some of their more colorful statements			0
the @entity30 's board includes @entity114 , president of @entity116 , and @entity117 , former chairman of the @entity118			0
the board also includes @entity120 , creator of @entity122 , and rock guitarist @entity123			0
@entity42 said the @entity30 has gotten involved in some other non-gun issues			0
for instance , he said , the @entity30 fought hard against campaign finance reform in the days of @entity127			0
" they were taking a very much free - enterprise , government - hands - off - the - campaign - process ( approach ) , " he said			0
but @entity42 said the @entity30 will always be primarily about guns and what they stand for in the individualist @entity81 mythology			1
he said the @entity30 's work is cut out for it , because gun ownership is on the decline in @entity81 .			1

@entity81 @entity13 getting attention for pushing conservative legislation
@entity143 was behind the spread of " stand your ground " laws
this week , @entity2 and @entity3 say they are pulling corporate memberships from group
the group has ties to the @entity30 , which has extended its reach beyond gun rights advocacy
