@entity0 -- for a second day , @entity4 president @entity3 's home was not spared from the wrath of protesters who remain unconvinced of his defense of recent controversial decisions			1
dozens of protesters threw rocks and glass bottles at the home in @entity16 province friday and tried to push aside a police barrier , said @entity18 , a spokesman for the @entity19			1
two policemen and several protesters were injured , and four people were arrested			0
protesters also made their message clear at the presidential palace in @entity0 , where thousands broke through a barricade and sprayed graffiti on the palace walls			1
guards at the palace did not engage the protesters			1
crowds also gathered at @entity0 's @entity34 but were largely calm , unlike the night before			1
in remarks thursday night -- his latest since the bloodiest stretch in two weeks of political unrest -- @entity3 refused to back off the controversial edict he issued or his nation 's upcoming constitutional referendum , saying he respects peaceful opposition to his decisions but wo n't stand for violence			1
on friday , @entity4 vice president @entity45 told @entity46 , a private @entity4 tv station , that @entity3 would consider postponing the referendum , so long as there are no legal challenges to the postponement			1
the president has agreed to delay the vote for expatriates until wednesday , said chief of staff @entity54			2
that vote was previously set for saturday			0
during his thursday speech , the president condemned those involved in the clashes -- referring specifically to those with weapons and who are backed by members of the " corrupt ... ex-regime			0
" he promised they 'd be held accountable			0
opinion : @entity3 miscalculating @entity4 ' rage " ( they ) will not escape punishment , " the president said in a televised speech			1
yet @entity3 's threat not only failed to mollify many protesters on the streets , it further enraged them			1
activists camped in the square chanted " leave ! leave ! leave ! " as the president talked			0
and minutes after the speech ended , the @entity80 headquarters in @entity0 was " ablaze , " state tv reported , citing witnesses			2
the @entity84 group said on its website and @entity86 that the building had come under " a terrorist attack , " with hundreds surrounding it			0
by early friday , there was no sign of a fire or significant damage			0
the @entity95 , an umbrella group of opposition organizations , called for large - scale demonstrations against a government it says has " lost legitimacy , " said the group , as reported by the semiofficial al - ahram newspaper			0
such a call for action -- and the sustained presence in @entity34 -- suggests activists are undaunted by threats from @entity3 and members of the @entity80 , the @entity84 group tied to him			2
the group was banned under longtime president @entity108 but is now @entity4 's dominant political force			2
on @entity86 , the @entity80 has said it will hold opposition figures " fully responsible for escalation of violence & inciting their supporters			2
" @entity115 : bloody clashes around @entity4 presidential palace @entity118 , a spokesman for @entity4 's newly appointed general prosecutor , said friday morning that @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 are being investigated for allegedly " conspiring to topple " the government			1
all three are well - known internationally -- with @entity121 being a @entity125 laureate and @entity122 a onetime head of the @entity127 -- and are now being probed for their role in the opposition against @entity3 , who defeated all three in this year 's presidential election			1
@entity121 said on @entity86 : " i call upon all the national forces and figures not to participate in a dialogue that lacks all the basics of a truthful discourse			0
we support a dialogue that is not based on the policy of arm - twisting and forcing the status quo			0
" during an interview with @entity142 , an @entity144 news network , @entity121 called on @entity3 to postpone the referendum vote and to " rescind the constitutional declaration			1
" he added that " only then will the opposition engage in dialogue			0
" those taking part in the protests around the @entity153 nation say the scenes are similar to those of the 2011 uprising that led to @entity108 's ouster			0
this time , they say , dissent is being vigorously stamped out by @entity3 's backers in government and on the street			1
specifically , they spoke of thugs with knives and rocks chasing activists , presidential backers belittling opponents and pressure from various quarters to go home and be quiet			1
" it 's exactly the same battle , " said @entity173 , a @entity1 ireporter			0
a november 22 edict by @entity3 , in which he made his decisions immune to judicial oversight until a new constitution is voted upon , set off the latest wave of political unrest			2
and it 's been growing -- and growing more violent -- in recent days			0
opposition leaders have been clear in saying what would mollify them : @entity3 must roll back his edict granting himself expanded presidential powers and must postpone a december 15 referendum on a proposed constitution , which they say does n't adequately represent or protect all @entity4			1
@entity3 previously said the edict was necessary to defend the revolution , and his administration has insisted the proposed constitution was drafted legally			2
if people vote it down , the president said thursday night that he 'd form a new assembly to draft another constitution			2
yet opposition activists have n't shown any indication that they trust @entity3 on that or other counts			2
they accuse him of consolidating power for himself and the @entity80 , in part by having an @entity84 - dominated group push through the draft constitution			0
this internal strife has helped transform the area around the presidential palace in @entity0 into a war zone			1
streets littered with rubble and burned cars were defined by barbed - wire barricades , patrolling soldiers , parked tanks and armored personnel carriers			0

@entity224 did not give a reason			0
his resignation brings to five the number of presidential advisers who have left in the past two days			0
it is the first , however , from the @entity225			0
@entity4 judges and media organizations also staged strikes to show their displeasure with the situation			0
and 11 organizations representing lawyers , journalists , writers , actors , musicians and tour guides said @entity3 and the @entity80 were behind the violence , @entity236 reported			1
the group said it would call for @entity3 's ouster if the administration failed to protect protesters and " fulfill the aspirations of the january 25 revolution , " the newspaper said			1
vice president @entity45 asked critics wednesday to submit their proposals for improving the constitution , and @entity3 invited political opponents to a meeting saturday at the presidential palace			1
