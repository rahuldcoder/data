-- it was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime for @entity4 , a @entity5 veteran who had long wanted to go to @entity6			1
it ended , according to his family , with the detention of @entity4 , 85 , when he was pulled off a plane at @entity13 's @entity12 five minutes before it was to depart			1
@entity4 , of @entity17 , @entity18 , has not been seen nor heard from since october 26 , the day he and a traveling companion wrapped up a 10 - day organized tour of @entity6 , his son , @entity15 , told @entity0			1
the @entity20 declined thursday to confirm @entity4 's identity or whether he had been detained , citing privacy issues			1
@entity6 has not publicly acknowledged that it is holding @entity4			1
@entity4 's son believes the detention is the result of " a misunderstanding			1
" " my father is a ( @entity5 ) veteran and wanted to see the country and culture he has been interested in for years , " he said			1
" he arranged this with a travel agent that was recommended and said was approved by the @entity6 government for travel of foreigners			1
he had all the proper visas			0
" @entity15 said his family has been working through the @entity20 since they found out that his father was being held			0
" we 've worked through the @entity20 from the day he was supposed to depart , " @entity4 said			1
" ... we 've heard nothing			0
" @entity15 said what he has heard has primarily come from his father 's traveling companion , who was on the plane			0
he identified the traveling companion as @entity45 , a friend who lives in the same retirement community			0
@entity4 was a customer of @entity49 of @entity50 , and he traveled with " one other gentleman " to @entity6 on the same private tour , @entity48 spokesman @entity47 said in a written statement			1

" bargaining chip ? news of the apparent detention came as talks were under way between the @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity6 's closest ally , about reviving negotiations to dismantle @entity13 's nuclear program			2
the timing raises questions about whether @entity6 plans to use @entity4 as a bargaining chip in the negotiations , a move the @entity78 has previously accused it of doing to try to gain concessions			1
@entity80 , the @entity68 special representative to @entity6 , declined to link the two , but said the detention of @entity68 citizens " is an indication that @entity6 seems not to be seeking a better relationship with the @entity68			2
" " again , these are separate matters , but we certainly think that @entity6 should think long and hard about these cases and understand that , for the @entity68 , these are matters of core concern for us , the fate of @entity68 who are in @entity6 being held by @entity6 , " he said thursday			2
the @entity68 , which does not maintain diplomatic relations with @entity6 , is working with @entity94 and @entity6 's top ally , @entity69 , to try to resolve the issue			2
questions have been raised about whether @entity4 's military service during the @entity5 may be related to his detention			1
@entity100 , chairman of the @entity102 - based @entity101 , says @entity4 may have been arrested on espionage charges			1
as a @entity5 veteran , @entity4 might have told his minders he fought against @entity6			1
they may have reported it , resulting in his detention			0

" i understand my dad was a bit bothered , " @entity4 said			2
but neither he nor his traveling companion believed there was an issue			0
the next day , @entity4 and @entity45 boarded a plane for @entity123			2
five minutes before the plane was to depart , authorities boarded and asked to see @entity4 's passport , his son said			1
according to the traveling companion 's account , the authorities then asked the elder @entity4 to leave the plane with them , @entity15 said			1
when the plane landed , @entity45 immediately contacted the @entity130 in @entity123 to report @entity4 had been taken off the plane , the younger @entity4 said			2
' trip of a lifetime ' the elder @entity4 was enjoying the trip and called home from @entity6 to tell his wife about it , his son said			1
the family also received postcards sent by @entity4 during the tour of @entity6 , he said			1

" it was the trip of a lifetime , " he said			0
@entity45 has declined to speak with reporters but , in a statement , said the situation has to be a " terrible misunderstanding			0
" the elder @entity4 suffers from a heart condition , his son said			2
medication was delivered to the @entity6 via @entity94 diplomats , but he said he is unsure whether the medication made it into his father 's hands			0
" we would like to know his status			0
we would like the @entity94 embassy to meet with him to ensure he 's getting his medication , " @entity15 said			0
" at the end of the day , we 'd like him to get on a plane and fly back to @entity167			0
he 's an 85 - year - old man who followed all the protocols			0
he did everything that he was supposed to do			0
" others detained @entity4 is one of two @entity68 citizens being held in @entity6			1
