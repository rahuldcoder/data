-- a new audio tape allegedly from @entity3 leader @entity2 claims responsibility for an attempt to blow up a plane en route to @entity8 on @entity9 and warns the @entity10 of more attacks			1
the tape , which aired on the @entity14 news web site @entity15 on sunday , says " the @entity10 will not dream of enjoying safety until we live it in reality in @entity19			1
" the tape continues : " it is not fair to enjoy that kind of life while our brothers in @entity24 live in the worst of miseries			0
" @entity0 could not independently confirm the authenticity of the message , but the @entity29 has in the past confirmed @entity15 reports on tapes from the @entity3 leader			1
president @entity33 's senior adviser @entity32 told @entity0 's " @entity34 " on sunday that while there was no immediate confirmation that the message was authentic , it " contains the same hollow justification for the slaughter of innocent people			1
" in another section of the audio tape that @entity15 broadcast , the voice says : " @entity45 willing our attacks will continue as long as you support the @entity49 and may peace be on those who follow guidance			1
" @entity2 also claims responsibility for the foiled attack on @entity54 in december			1
" the message intended to be sent to you was through the hero fighter @entity57 , may @entity45 release him , confirming an earlier message that the [ september ] 11th heroes delivered to you and it was repeated before and after [ that event ] , " he says			0
a @entity65 man , @entity64 , has been charged with attempting to blow up the @entity67 plane as it approached @entity68 from @entity69 , @entity70			0
" @entity71 was behind the failed attack on christmas day			0
that 's clear , " a @entity10 counterterrorism official -- who is not authorized to speak publicly -- told @entity0			1
" so a message like this -- no matter whose voice it may be -- should come as no surprise			0
@entity71 has , from time to time , tried to build support for its program of murder by talking about the @entity85 issue			0
that line 's never gotten them much in the past , and it 's unlikely to now , either			0
" @entity2 had six messages in 2009			1
the last was on september 25 and was " to the @entity92 people			0
" in that message , he urged the countries to reconsider their involvement in the @entity98 war			0
" today @entity92 is suffering an economic crisis , and its export reputation does n't hold true anymore , while @entity10 is bleeding economically because of all the wars it is involved in , " his last message said			2
" think about how @entity92 will fare when @entity10 pulls out of @entity98			2
you will be left to suffer alone the rage of the people you oppressed			0
" a security expert said there 's a possibility @entity2 did not know about the attempted attack in december and @entity3 branches may be using it to prove themselves to the group 's leadership			1
" they were able to get their man on an @entity10 plane on an @entity10 soil so it is successful by all means , " said @entity115 at the @entity116			2
" the strategy is there , outlined by the mother leadership and now we will see the branches doing their best to please their leadership and implement @entity3 vision in their own ways			2
" @entity2 is thought to be hiding in the @entity133 - @entity98 mountain region , according to intelligence experts .			2
