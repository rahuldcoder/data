@entity0 , @entity1 -- she says she did n't want to do it , but was convinced by a teacher 's aide to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator			1
what happened next was horrific : the then - 14 - year - old girl says she was sodomized by a fellow student in a school bathroom			1
now 19 , she is telling her story publicly for the very first time			1
" i just felt like i was set up by the teachers			2
they gave me a word that they could n't keep , " said the woman , who asked @entity2 to call her " @entity17			1
" according to court records , a 16 - year - old student approached @entity23 in the hallway of @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity1 , on january 22 , 2010 , and asked her to meet him in a bathroom for sex			1
it was not the first time the boy had propositioned her , said @entity23 , who was enrolled in the school 's special education program			1
usually , she just ignored him			2
but , on that day , @entity23 told a friend , who suggested she tell a teacher 's aide about what was happening			2
that aide , june @entity40 , knew of other girls who the boy had tried to lure into a bathroom for sex , according to a 2010 federal lawsuit filed by @entity23 's father against @entity47 and officials			1
@entity40 , in turn , told the school 's principal , @entity50 , about the allegations			1
according to a 2012 deposition , @entity50 told @entity40 the boy would have to be proven guilty to be punished			2
in response , @entity40 crafted a plan to prove the allegations , using @entity23 as bait			2
the idea was to have the girl agree to meet the boy in a bathroom			2
@entity40 would watch surveillance video , and teachers would intervene before anything happened			2
" i told her no. i did n't want to do it , " @entity23 told @entity2			1
she acquiesced later that day			2
" i just wanted it to stop , " @entity23 said about the alleged harassment			1
' he just gets away with it ' key questions in her case center around who knew what and when			2
@entity23 and @entity40 claim they then went to the office of vice-principal @entity75			0
however , @entity40 says when she told @entity75 about the plan , @entity75 did not respond			0
during a deposition , @entity75 denied the conversation happened			0
@entity23 says she then left @entity75 's office and found the boy in the hallway to tell him they could " do it			0
" @entity40 stayed behind to watch surveillance monitors , hoping to catch the two walk into the bathroom			0
according to @entity23 's written statement after the incident , the boy made a last - minute change			0
instead of meeting in the boys ' bathroom on the special needs students ' corridor , the boy allegedly told the girl to meet him in the sixth grade boys ' bathroom , in another part of the school			1
once there , @entity23 says she tried to stall the boy , hoping a teacher would rush in			0
she told him she did n't want to have sex , and she tried blocking him , according to her 2012 deposition			0
@entity23 says the boy sodomized her			0
" i thought they were going to do what they said they were going to do -- and be there and stop him -- just get him in trouble , " @entity23 told @entity2			1
the alleged attacker was never charged and the case was never presented to a grand jury , according to @entity118 district attorney @entity117			1
the incident was characterized as " inappropriate ( sic ) touching a girl in boys bathroom " according to school disciplinary records			1
the boy was suspended from school for five days and sent to an alternative school for a short time			1
the alleged attack was at least the 13th incident of sexual or violent misconduct in the boy 's file , all within two academic years			1
while at the alternative school , the boy was suspended for sharing pornographic images on a cell phone			1
he was eventually allowed to return to @entity25 while @entity23 was still enrolled as a student			0
" he just gets away with it , i guess , " she told @entity2			1
june @entity40 resigned shortly after the incident			0
" my client has gone from being a teacher 's aide to being a scapegoat , " @entity40 's attorney , @entity137 told @entity2			1
@entity75 is now the principal at nearby @entity142			0
' hard for me to have good days ' in 2013 , a district court judge allowed the father 's claims of state violations , including negligence , against @entity40 and @entity75			0
the judge tossed out the federal claims -- that the school district violated @entity152 and that @entity40 and school administrators deprived the girl of her civil rights			1
@entity152 is a federal law aimed at ending sexual discrimination in education			0
in part , it dictates how schools that receive federal funds must respond to claims of sexual harassment			0
" ( judge t. @entity165 ) found the board of education 's policies were proper			0
he found that the school administrators took appropriate action and complied completely with federal law as soon as they were notified of this unfortunate incident , " attorney @entity168 told reporters last month			2
@entity168 's firm represents @entity47 and the administrators named in the 2010 lawsuit			2
the firm has not responded to @entity2 's numerous calls for an interview			1
also in september , the @entity181 's @entity180 submitted a 126 - page strident amicus brief to the @entity183 , disagreeing with the district judge 's order			0
the brief , submitted jointly with the @entity188 @entity187 , argues the school , in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is " liable for ( its ) deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment			2
" " if @entity152 imposes any responsibility on school officials to prevent sexual harassment , it surely requires a response when they learn , as here , that a 14 - year - old special needs student is about to be used as bait to catch a 16 - year - old student with an extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct , " federal attorneys write in the brief			2
on the same day the federal brief was submitted , the @entity208 , joined by 32 national and local organizations , submitted a joint brief supporting the family 's lawsuit			0
the @entity214 and the family 's attorney , @entity215 , have also submitted a joint brief to the @entity183			0
" it means a lot			0
it says that people actually care about what happens , " @entity23 told @entity2 months after the incident , the teen transferred to a school district out of state , but eventually dropped out of school before graduating			1
@entity23 says she continues to struggle			0
" it 's hard for me to have good days , " she told @entity2			1
" i have days to where i just want to sit there by myself			0
i get angry faster , and i get insecure			0
" asked what might help her , she stressed the importance of justice and closure			0
" by actually having our day in court , and letting everything be known , so that it wo n't happen again , " @entity23 said			0
@entity2 's @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report from @entity240 .			1

the woman , now 19 , talks about her story publicly for the first time
she said she was raped in an @entity1 school in 2010
" he just gets away with it , i guess , " she tells @entity2 about her alleged attacker
