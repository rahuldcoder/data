@entity1 's new anti-impunity commissioner , @entity0 , arrived to the @entity3 nation in october with an ambitious agenda , promising to probe links between drug traffickers and political parties			1
" we 're going to investigate if organized crime has permeated political campaigns with their financing , " he told @entity8 in an exclusive interview			1
the announcement sent shock waves across a country that faces one of the highest murder rates in @entity19			2
widespread institutional corruption and societal violence related to drug trafficking continue to be a concern , according to a recent @entity25 report			2
previous commissioners have had successes exposing networks that colluded with the government			2
but @entity0 envisions an investigation that could expose the very apparatuses of criminal activity leaving no stone unturned			1
for @entity0 , it 's a question of transparency			1
" we need to consolidate the activities of political parties so in return they can be more coherent , stronger and permanent , " he said			1
the 58 - year - old @entity41 magistrate was tapped in september by the @entity42 to take the helm of the @entity44 in @entity1 , a special independent body of prosecutors known by its @entity48 acronym @entity49			1
a special treaty - level agreement between @entity1 and the @entity42 signed in 2006 , gives the commission special power to investigate a limited number of sensitive cases			1
investigating political parties is sure to ruffle feathers , but it 's something @entity0 done before			1
and he 's asking @entity1 to take part			0
" in this investigation in particular we need the biggest citizen involvement possible , " @entity0 said			1
" we will vet all of the information they are willing to give us			0
" from @entity41 to @entity3 @entity0 rose through the judicial ranks exploring the links between congressmen and paramilitary groups in @entity41 in the 2000s			1
this ended with several members of @entity41 congress behind bars			1
during its worst period , @entity41 overrun by organized crime before order was restored , @entity0 said			1
@entity1 can still prevent falling into those same depths that other countries have faced			0
" by what i have seen in @entity1 over the course of these last two months , we 're in the beginning stages , " he said			0
@entity1 attorney general @entity83 is confident the commissioner 's experience in @entity41 will allow him to tackle such high - caliber investigations			1
after all , @entity83 said , " there are similarities in how organized crime has permeated different sectors of society both within and outside of the state apparatus			0
" according to international observers , @entity83 's leadership of the public ministry in conjunction with the commission has been instrumental in quashing organized crime gangs			2
for @entity100 , a former @entity1 vice president who was one of the key negotiators to bring the @entity49 to @entity1 , it could be a determining moment for this nation 's democracy			0
finally , we could have some sort if transparency in how we do politics in this country , " @entity100 said			0
but other segments of society , including president @entity112 himself , appear less supportive of @entity0 's quest			1
@entity0 " does n't have enough time " to investigate political parties and should only focus on finishing the commission 's mandate , @entity115 told local media			1
@entity115 's office did not return @entity8 's multiple requests for comment			0
in the past , @entity49 has successfully prosecuted several high - profile cases , including the death of lawyer @entity126 , which nearly brought down the government of former president @entity129			2
@entity126 had taped a video claiming that if he was killed it had been at the hands of the president			0
the commission 's investigation revealed it was @entity126 who had order the hit on his own life			2
the members of the hired eight - person gang were later convicted for the murder			2
its long - term mission , however , is strengthening state institutions before the commission leaves in @entity1 , expected in 2015			1
the commission 's mandate could also be renewed			2
but , since its inception , some @entity1 legislators and other officials have lobbied unsuccessfully to have the @entity42 - backed entity expelled			1
@entity0 is n't going quietly into the night over a little hostility			1
" just because some segment of society opposes the investigation , it does n't mean it will fail or be truncated , " he said			0
testing democracy despite the opposition that @entity49 faces , however , there are many observers at home and abroad who support its mandate			0
an investigation into the nexus between political parties and organized crime has been a long way coming for both the @entity49 and @entity1 , said @entity169 , a longtime @entity1 scholar and professor of political science at @entity172 in @entity173			1
" it 's the next step that had to be taken , " @entity169 said			0
" the landscape in @entity1 has shifted ever so slightly			0
it 's been biting at the edges and it 's finally gotten to the core			0
" prior to the commission 's creation , @entity1 had a 97 & impunity rate			2
only 3 percent of homicides ended in a conviction			0
@entity49 oversaw the hiring of hundreds of new prosecutors , the creation of new units and the purging of the country 's public ministry			0
under @entity83 's tenure , the attorney general 's office slashed the impunity rate by more than a quarter			0
in a recent report of the public ministry 's results for 2013 , @entity83 's office convicted a record 7,122 people in 2013 â€” an increase of 20 percent as compared to 5,941 in 2012			0
@entity200 , @entity201 ambassador to @entity1 , says the future lies in the hands of @entity1 themselves			0
@entity201 has donated more than $ 25 million to the commission			2
" in the end , " he says , " the fight against impunity completely depends on the country 's authorities			0

@entity0 is the new commissioner for a @entity42 - backed anti-impunity commission
he vows to go after ties between drug traffickers and political parties
@entity0 did the same as a judge in @entity41
his work makes some officials *uncomfortable*
