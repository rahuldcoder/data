-- distracted by the easy money of @entity4 slasher films , @entity1 has long ignored the more fun - spirited side of the modern , billion - dollar @entity7 holiday			1
but it 's the perfect setting for the brand of teen comedies that made @entity11 and @entity12 famous			2
that 's clearly the idea behind " @entity15 , " which tells the story of a smart and responsible high - school senior ( @entity18 's @entity17 ) whose @entity4 turns into a disastrous adventure in babysitting			1
she wants to go to the cool dress - up party â € ” her idea of a great costume is @entity24 â € ” with her shallow bff ( @entity26 )			2
but when her pathetic widowed mother ( @entity27 ) pawns her devilish little brother on her so she can party like a teenager herself , chaos and coincidences ensue			2
she loses the kid at a neighborhood haunted house and has to track him down him before mom gets home			0
you 'd hope that " @entity40 " creator @entity39 , directing for the first time , would have a better feel for such matter , but " @entity15 " blatantly and lazily traces mediocre versions of the genre			1
( who wants to be a poor poor - man 's version of " @entity48 " ? ) there is no attempt to reinvent , and what might have been a half - decent homage is undermined by numbing comic failure			0
' @entity54 ' : like @entity55 as a vamp ? at least @entity57 delivers her lines with some snap , and even though she could play the snarky best friend in her sleep , she still has fun with it , which is greatly appreciated			1
@entity27 , on the other hand , looks literally pained , and fans of the talented comedian will wonder why she 's already taking thankless mom roles after films like bridesmaids proved a market for brassy female - driven comedies			0
@entity72 brings gifts to ' @entity75 ' crowd this movie has no courage and little brains , and is salvaged , if at all , only by its heart			0
there remains a huge market for a great @entity4 teen comedy , but " @entity15 " is the disappointing apple that your crazy - haired neighbor gives you instead of candy			1
feel free to dump this one in the bushes			0
