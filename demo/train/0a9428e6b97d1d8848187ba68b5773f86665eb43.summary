-- president @entity1 took a great first step in making our country safer wednesday when he signed executive actions to reduce gun violence and urged @entity7 to reinstate the 2004 assault weapons ban			1
but the president 's actions do not let the rest of us off the hook			1
each one of us needs to decide on our own how we will participate in shaping our country 's future			1
let the families of @entity16 grieve			2
the rest of us need to get to work			1
read @entity1 's proposals in 2003 , my cousin 's 15 - year - old son was shot and killed by a robber			1
my cousin found solidarity with other parents whose children had been snatched by gun violence , making instant activists out of moms and dads			1
as i thought of the parents of @entity16 over the past month , steeped in their grief , i realized how little i know , how little i have ever wanted to know , about the circumstances surrounding the gun death closest to me			1
i do n't know what kind of gun was used to murder my own relative			1
even if i did , what would it mean to me ? i 've never owned a gun nor have i ever touched one			1
i have never even knowingly been in the presence of one			2
i have taken false and selfish comfort in believing that guns and the chaos connected to them were worlds away			2
not wanting to wade into the debate around gun control , my position on guns has been one of naivety and willed ignorance			1
but i wo n't avoid it any longer			0
opinion : @entity58 's paranoid fantasy flouts democracy it is much easier to cry in front of my television and feel helpless than to learn what these weapons are , what they do and what i can do to make events like @entity16 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 less likely to happen again			2
my relationship to my community needs to be one but of action			0
i have to learn the names and capacities of assault style rifles as i would learn the names and potencies of common poisons for my own safety			0
a semiautomatic handgun can theoretically shoot 1,500 rounds in seven minutes if a shooter could possible manage it			0
the @entity85 , a semiautomatic rifle , uses a 20 or 30 - round magazine			0
it may seem daunting to enter into the fray of a heated issue , to shape public opinion and to push our elected officials to substantive change , but we 've done it before			2
in the 1960s , everyday people , from maids to college students and church members , said " enough is enough " to the back of the bus , separate water fountains and segregated lunch counters			0
nearly two decades later , a mother who lost her child to a drunken driver launched the organization @entity108 and led the country to enduring cultural and legislative transformation to stop drunken driving and to institute stricter alcohol policies			0
voices of the people played a role in the passage of the @entity117 and public opinion pushed @entity7 to pass the 1993 @entity119			0
politics : would @entity1 's gun violence measures work ? yes , civil discourse can be uncivil			1
but do n't let toxic internet trolls and television zealots stop you from participating in this vital public discussion			0
the grieving families of @entity16 and the grieving families of the hundreds of people who will have died from gun shootings since @entity16 will be conscripted to the front lines of the gun control debate			1
but we ca n't let them fight it on their own			0
because the truth is , when an average of eight children die from gun violence every day in this country , nobody is left untouched by a shooting death			1
eventually , that evil will make its mark , directly or indirectly , on all of us			0
in the wake of the one - month anniversary of the @entity16 shootings , the country 's grief over mass shootings , one - on - one gun violence and unintentional gun deaths weighs so heavily on our collective conscience that once again the nation seems ready to take action			1
yes , our elected officials must lead and we must hold them accountable if they do n't			0
but we must do our part as well			0
we have to organize and shape public opinion to make it easier for the president and @entity7 to do what they must			0
we can start by educating ourselves			0
know what these weapons of mass destruction do , know who is trying to stop research on gun safety , know what organizations are pushing for more comprehensive bans			2
once we 're educated , we can educate our friends and families and build a groundswell , home by home , street by street and block by block			2
because that is what this is going to take			0
it 's going to take all of us			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			1

@entity189 : @entity1 took good first step to end gun violence with his executive actions
but that 's not enough , she says ; we are all still *responsible* and need to get to work
@entity202 ' cousin 's son was shot and killed , but she buried her head in the sand on the issue
now , she realizes that she and all @entity208 need to get educated and act for gun control
