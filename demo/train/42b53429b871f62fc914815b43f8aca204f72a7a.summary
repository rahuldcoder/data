it 's given us robot cars and internet - enabled glasses -- but when it came to creating a " @entity6 " of a desert , @entity4 hit on a low - tech solution			2
the beast has become the first animal to carry @entity4 's @entity13 camera , which is typically hoisted by humans to capture 360 - degree images of destinations inaccessible to its @entity6 cars			1
@entity4 spokeswoman @entity18 says the camel , reportedly named @entity20 , was an apt way of documenting the beautiful shifting sands of @entity24 's @entity23			1
" with every environment and every location , we try to customize the capture and how we do it for that part of the environment , " she told @entity26 newspaper			0
" in the case of @entity23 we fashioned it in a way so that it goes on a camel so that it can capture imagery in the best , most authentic and least damaging way , " @entity32 said			0
the @entity23 is a 100 kilometer - wide ( 62 - mile ) scenic desert , southeast of the city of @entity24 that includes some of the world 's biggest sand dunes			2
bizarre sights @entity44 have previously explored sites including the @entity46 , @entity47 , the @entity48 , the @entity50 pyramids and the complexes of temples around @entity53 in @entity54			1
there 's even an subaquatic trek of waters around the @entity59 islands			1
of course , while the camel can only be seen in shadow on the images it captured , @entity4 's @entity6 cars have witnessed plenty of other bizarre sights			1
earlier this year one clocked what appeared to be the scene of an ax murder on the streets of @entity71			0
it later turned out to be a prank staged by auto mechanics who 'd spotted the car on its approach			0
another hoax involved a woman pretending to give birth on a roadside			0
the service , which began in 2007 , has also hosted more startling sights such as a naked guy climbing out the trunk of a car and a man with the head of a horse .			0

@entity24 's @entity23 is captured using a @entity92 camera *attached* to a camel
@entity4 spokeswoman says the beast was most appropriate way to explore the area
