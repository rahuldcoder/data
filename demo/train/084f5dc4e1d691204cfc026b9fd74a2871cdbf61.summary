-- world no. 1 @entity1 has set his sights on a first @entity5 title after beating second - ranked @entity6 in a epic five - set @entity8 final on sunday			1
the @entity10 final was the longest ever played in one of tennis ' four grand slams , as @entity1 claimed his fifth major crown and third in @entity10 with a 5 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 7 7 - 5 win in five hours and 53 minutes			1
when asked if this was his greatest win , the @entity18 -- who has beaten @entity6 in the last three grand slam finals -- told reporters : " yes			1
" this one i think comes out on the top because we played almost six hours ... i think it 's probably the longest finals in the history of all grand slams , and just to hear that fact is making me cry			1
can anyone stop champion @entity1 ? " i 'm very proud just to be part of this history , part of the elite of the players that have won this tournament several times			2
" i was very flattered to be playing in front of @entity40 , in front of the all - time greats , and in front of 15,000 people that stayed until 1:30 a.m. " @entity45 legend @entity40 is the last man to hold all four grand slam titles at one time , having achieved that feat for a second time in 1969			1
@entity1 can match that if he wins the @entity5 for the first time in june , though his quadruple slam would be in a non-calendar year			1
the 24 - year - old hopes to improve his performance at @entity5 , where last year he was beaten in the semifinals by 16 - time major winner @entity54 to end a 43 - match winning run			1
" i 'm prioritizing grand slams this year , as every year , and the @entity59 , " the 24 - year - old said			2
" i think that 's one of my highest goals			0
" so i want to do well and i want to get the first final at least in @entity64			2
i have never been in finals there , and i have a feeling that i 'm ready this year to achieve that			0
" @entity1 has now won seven successive finals against @entity6 , including @entity70 and the @entity71 , but he gave due credit to the @entity74 champion after their marathon match			1
" unfortunately there had to only be one winner because we both gave it all			0
we both put 100 % of our abilities on the court and played to the last moment , " he said			0
" there could n't be two winners , but he definitely deserved to be a winner as well			0
i would be saying same thing if i was sitting here as a loser			0
" after an intensive fortnight of competition , @entity1 said he planned to ban his friends from talking to him about tennis			2
" please , yes , " he joked when asked he was going to take a break from the game			0
" i 'm going to definitely try to get that message to them			0
