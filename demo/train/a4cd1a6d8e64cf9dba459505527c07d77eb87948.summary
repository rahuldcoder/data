-- authorities blocked @entity5 sen. @entity4 at @entity6 on monday after the @entity8 @entity7 refused a pat - down at a security checkpoint , his spokeswoman said			1
@entity4 told @entity0 that he went through a scanner at the airport and set off an alarm			1
he wanted to go through the body scan again instead of getting a pat - down -- claiming that he showed @entity18 officers his knee and under his socks -- but the agents refused his request , according to the @entity8 senator			1
" when an irregularity is found during the @entity18 screening process , it must be resolved prior to allowing a passenger to proceed to the secure area of the airport , " @entity18 spokesman @entity24 said			1
" passengers who refuse to complete the screening process can not be granted access to the secure area in order to ensure the safety of others traveling			1
" the senator said that he did n't think it was " appropriate " for him to have a pat - down , adding he should have been able to go through the scanner again			1
" is it too much to ask to have a little dignity when you travel ? and should n't an adult be able to get back in line and go through the scanner ? " he told @entity0			2
" i do n't think that 's too much to ask			0
" a @entity18 official said @entity4 was " not detained at any point " and left the checkpoint willingly			1
the official was not authorized to speak for attribution			0
@entity4 said he was " ejected " from the screening area and told he may be subject to a " full body search " after he began talking on his phone			2
he was eventually rebooked on another @entity56 - bound flight , saying that time the screener did not go off when he went through it			2
" it tells me that either the machines are inadequate , or they are not telling us the whole story , " said @entity4 , insisting that two @entity18 agents told him that the screeners go off randomly -- an assertion the federal agency denies			2
one of the most conservative members of the @entity69 , @entity4 is an outspoken critic of what he characterizes as an overly obtrusive federal government threatening to strip citizens of various rights and civil liberties			0
during a @entity69 hearing with @entity18 administrator @entity77 in november , @entity4 argued that the @entity18 policy of letting children go through the full - body scanners twice -- rather then be subjected to a pat - down -- should apply to adults as well			1
he predicted that with such a policy , " you 'll get rid of a lot of the anger and animosity towards the @entity18			0
" on monday , the senator said he also supported some sort of " frequent traveler " program -- so that people who travel often are n't as likely to be subject to pat - downs -- and " selective risk assessments done on people are international travelers ( and ) people who have ties to groups that may be terrorists			1
" he added that someone in the screening area should have " discretion " to decide , on a case - by - case basis , if a pat - down is necessary			1
" i think we 've gone overboard ... i feel that our dignity is compromised , but i do n't feel more safe , " said @entity4 , noting he spoke with @entity77 after the incident monday			2
" regular , ordinary citizens do n't need to be put through this , particularly the frequent travelers			0
" @entity4 is the son of libertarian @entity113 rep. @entity112 , a candidate for the @entity7 presidential nomination			0
@entity112 weighed in on the controversy monday afternoon , calling it an example of a " police state in this country " that " is growing out of control			0
" " one of the ultimate embodiments of this ( police state ) is the @entity18 that gropes and grabs our children , our seniors , and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities , " the congressman said in a written statement			0
" the @entity18 does all of this while doing nothing to keep us safe			0
" @entity0 's @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .			0
