-- the largest case of bank fraud in @entity2 history is threatening to engulf president @entity6 after a parliamentary commission decided to investigate his office for possible connections to the crime , @entity2 state media has reported			1
to add insult to injury , @entity12 hard - line legislators loyal to @entity2 's @entity13 , the @entity14 , subsequently sent the commission a letter requesting specifically that @entity6 be included in the investigation			1
they have since said they would not follow up on the letter out of respect for @entity14			0
it is one move of many by @entity25 to link the president to the alleged embezzlement of 30 trillion @entity2 rials -- more than $ 2.5 billion			1
to frame the extent of allegations in @entity32 terms : it would be akin to religious conservative legislators attempting to implicate a sitting @entity32 president in the infamous @entity36 , in which disgraced financier @entity37 cheated investors out of $ 50 billion			2
@entity6 has vehemently rejected accusations that anyone in his government is linked to what is currently the highest - profile crime in the country , according to the semi-official @entity45			1
" the government had no role in this affair and the banking system itself discovered the fraud , " @entity6 said in a televised interview tuesday , according to @entity45 two @entity2 economists who spoke to @entity0 alluded to political opportunism in the accusations against the president and people close to him			1
but both believe politicians were involved , possibly even directly			2
the size and nature of the fraud required " a trend inside the government to make this problem and this scandal , " said @entity68 economic analyst @entity67			2
a second economist points out that the main suspect in the case has ties to the @entity2 president 's chief adviser , @entity73 , who used his influence in a bank business deal for the accused man , @entity77			1
@entity77 had opened a private bank known as the @entity79			0
getting a license is usually difficult , but @entity73 used his political pull to help pave the way , said economist dr. @entity83 from @entity68			0
" more than ten times he has written letters to bank persons , " said @entity83 , who spoke with banking officials about the founding of the bank			2
a former professor of economics , @entity83 now runs a development consultancy and has closely followed the embezzlement case			0
he has also spoken to officials close to it and been allowed to see some of the bank data firsthand			1
@entity73 and @entity77 also both come from the same province , said @entity83			0
@entity73 , the president 's adviser as well as a close personal friend , is also a thorn in the side of @entity12 politicians loyal to @entity14			1
hardliners have long called for @entity73 's dismissal , but @entity6 has held fast to his loyal friend , with whom he now has family ties			1
in 2008 , @entity73 's daughter married @entity6 's eldest son			1
@entity73 has regularly rankled the religious right with conciliatory tones toward @entity110 and the @entity32 -- moves considered serious gaffes in @entity2 -- and his habit of shaking hands with women in formal settings , which is considered culturally impolite by many in @entity2 society and thought to be indecent by the religious right			1
in defense of softer comments toward the @entity32 and @entity110 , @entity73 has explained to @entity2 state tv : " my statement was that we , the @entity2 people , are friends of the whole wide world , even the people of @entity110 and @entity32			1
there is no reason for us not to be friends			0
i did not deny making that statement , and i am not denying it now			0
" bold words for a presidential adviser in @entity2			1
@entity14 has rebutted @entity73 's statements as not reflecting @entity2 's position			1
@entity73 's praise for historic heroes of @entity140 times , when @entity141 -- now a minority faith -- was the religion of the land , has particularly offended @entity12 politicians			0
even though the @entity2 bank fraud , which made use of illegitimate letters of credit , encompasses a much smaller amount of money than the @entity37 ponzi scheme did , it is at least twice the size when compared to @entity2 's gdp , according to @entity83			1
" it is about 0.8 % of @entity155 , " he said			0
" if you measure it by the outstanding loans of the banking system to the private sector , it is about 1 % of the outstanding loans			0
" in other words , 100 such scams " could take all of the banking system			0
" the crime involves at least seven banks , @entity169 has reported , including two major financial institutions , @entity170 and @entity171			0
" @entity171 is the biggest banking system in the @entity25 world , " said @entity67			0
" it is very big and the oldest bank in the country			0
this bank has suffered a lot			0
" rhetoric linking the embezzlement to the president 's office is as old as the scandal itself			2
a conservative @entity12 newspaper , @entity189 , has been widely credited for bringing the fraud to light , when it reported financial misappropriations and other shady dealings in june in an article headlined " the weeds			0
" the article alleged involvement of people close to @entity6 , whom hardliners have labeled the " deviant current " for their departure from the righteous principals of @entity25 in society , politics and economics -- people associated with @entity6 's friend and adviser @entity73			1
" we hope that the respected president will take out the members of this deviant band like weeds and throw them out of the garden of government , " the article stated , addressing @entity6			1
the " deviant current " label has become a well - established political slight in @entity2 state media			1
the criminal investigation of the embezzlement has lead to 22 arrests and the resignation of three of @entity2 's highest banking officials , according to state - run @entity169			1
the head of @entity171 fled the country for @entity226 in late september , @entity169 reported			0
@entity0 found his name and address on the internet in a cached view of an @entity2 business contact website in @entity232			1
the phone numbers and website listed did not work			0
the embezzlement case was referred to the courts in august , @entity169 said			0
although they have faced criticism in state media , members of the government had not previously been subjects of the bank fraud investigation			2
but then in first days of october , a commission charged with investigating illegal activity in the judicial and executive branches -- which would include the office of the president -- called up evidence in the case , according to @entity169 , in order to scrutinize it for any involvement in the fraud by members of the government			1
on october 3 , 11 @entity12 members of parliament sent a letter to the @entity256 of the @entity257 --- @entity257 is the name for @entity2 's parliament -- demanding that @entity6 be included in their investigation , @entity45 reported			1
the @entity45 article pointed out that just enough parliamentarians accused the president or ministers to require that the matter be immediately investigated			2
a day later , the hardliners announced they would not follow up on their letter , according to the semi-official @entity269 , out of respect after @entity14 said that " an atmosphere of calm is needed in order for this case to be investigated			0
" the @entity45 article detailed the complicated parliamentary procedure that could lead to the president 's impeachment , which includes at least three rounds of voting			2
the @entity45 is belongs to the hardline @entity280			0
on the same day , @entity45 published an article in which @entity14 called for the strictest of punishment for those convicted , urging judicial officials to " cut off the hands of the traitors			2
" corruption is rampant in @entity2 , and political involvement in it is commonplace , leaving politicians no lack of scandals of which to accuse their opponents , says economist @entity83			1
" always there has been corruption in the government -- different sectors -- and everybody knows it , but recently , because the rivalry for the next election has increased , they 're trying to use these as a tool against their rival groups , " he said			2
@entity307 gives @entity2 the same grade on corruption as @entity309 , the @entity310 and @entity311			1
the theocratic regime stands near the bottom of @entity307 's rating list -- number 146 out of 178 nations			0
@entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319 come away better			0
fighting corruption is a common mantra espoused by @entity2 's political leaders			1
but they are failing , according to economist @entity67 , and should be held responsible , although he does not name specific government officials			1
" the most important thing for politics , for the government , for the judiciary system is that we create an atmosphere in which corruption can not occur , can not appear , " @entity67 said			2
" they brought this atmosphere , and in my opinion , they are responsible for this disaster			0
" although this bank fraud is the largest in the county 's history , @entity67 believes that it represents less than a quarter of current such crimes in his country			0
and it will not harm @entity2 's economy , he said			1
" from an economic point of view , it is not so significant			0
it will not affect the economy of the country			0
but from a psychological point of view , it affects very much , " he explained			0
@entity83 agreed , and said that the seized assets of those arrested will more than cover the economic damage the embezzlement caused			0
most of the embezzled money was used to buy companies from the government , he added , placing it into the country 's economy and government coffers			2
@entity6 's opponents did not conspire to concoct a presidential scandal out of the bank fraud , @entity83 believes			1
" there was no plot , but the timing of this discovery and the intentions of the government authorities is meaningful , " the economist said			2
religious ultra-conservative politicians seeking leverage against @entity6 to force him to fall in line with the country 's supreme leader now have the opportunity to associate him -- via his liberal friends -- with the worst embezzlement scandal in the country 's history .			2

a close adviser to @entity6 has links to the main suspect
@entity2 economists say government insiders had to be involved
the @entity2 president rejects claims that he or other government officials involved
