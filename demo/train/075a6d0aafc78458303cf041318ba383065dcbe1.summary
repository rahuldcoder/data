a few years ago @entity0 boarded a public bus in the northern @entity3 town of @entity4			1
he went toward the nearest vacant seat but before he could sit down the man in the adjacent seat snapped , " go away ! do n't sit next to me			2
" " i wanted to answer back , but i controlled myself , " recalled @entity0 , now 53 years old			1
" i felt my blood pressure rise			2
" he stayed on the bus , standing			0
" there were lots of people on the bus , and they heard it all , but no one said a word			0
" @entity0 has long been accustomed to the unkindness of strangers			1
he suffers from a non-infectious genetic disease , neurofibromatosis type 1			1
it has left him completely covered from head to toe with growths , swellings and itchy sores			2
his mother suffered from the same illness before she died , and his sister has a milder version of it			2
his aunt , @entity33 , says his undershirt is often completely soaked in blood that seeps from the sores			0
in early november @entity0 traveled with his aunt and dozens of others from northern @entity3 to @entity38 , where they attended a morning public audience held by @entity40			1
@entity0 , who has difficulty staying on his feet for long , was in a wheelchair			1
" we did n't think we would be so close to the @entity40 , but the @entity48 kept ushering us forward until we were in a corner in the front row , " recalled @entity33 , a woman in her late sixties with a quick smile and an infectious laugh			1
" when he came close to us , " she said , " i thought he would give me his hand			0
instead he went straight to @entity0 and embraced him tightly			1
i thought he would n't give him back to me he held him so tightly			2
we said nothing but he looked at me as if he was digging deep inside , a beautiful look that i would never have expected			0
" @entity0 , accustomed to stares of shock and fear , was initially confused by the pontiff 's lack of hesitation			1
" he did n't have any fear of my illness , " he said			1
" he embraced me without speaking ... i quivered			1
i felt a great warmth			0
" in moments of drama , odd details often remain vivid			0
" i looked down at his shoes , " @entity0 's aunt recalled			1
" they were like this , " she said , holding her hands apart and laughing			0
" i thought yes , this is someone who really walks			0
" the entire encounter lasted little over a minute , and soon @entity0 and his aunt were back on the bus , @entity0 in a state of combined shock and joy			1
" he was almost not himself , " @entity33 said			0
" " i felt i was returning home ten years younger , as if a load had been lifted , " @entity0 said			1
but life returned to normal soon enough			0
he went back to his job at a home for the elderly , collecting and throwing out the trash , running odd jobs			0
he works there on weekdays and in slower moments enjoys chatting with the residents who do n't seem to notice his condition			2
his preferred topic of conversation is the ups and downs of @entity100 , his favorite football team			0
when i ventured to discuss football with him , suggesting he should consider the merits of other teams , like @entity105 or @entity106 , he was dismissive , shaking his head and wagging his fingers in contempt			0
@entity110 , the director of the home , said @entity0 's energy and humor help keep the residents ' spirits up			1
he said , " everyday he meets a lot of people here who like him , who chat and joke with him			0
" when @entity0 finishes work , he rides his bicycle back to the flat he shares with his sister @entity123			1
@entity124 says he can be lazy when it comes to preparing meals , and often prefers to make a sandwich to avoid having to wash the dishes			0
@entity131 @entity105 producers @entity129 and @entity132 had been trying for weeks to speak with @entity0 , ever since the photos of his embrace with @entity40 were first made public			1
initially his family was hesitant , but the encounter with @entity40 emboldened him			2
a change came over him , he said			0
" i feel stronger and happier			0
i feel i can move ahead because the @entity138 is protecting me			0
" " now that people have seen him they will be less detached , " said his aunt , who also hopes the @entity40 's embrace and the media furor it whipped up will raise awareness about neurofibromatosis			1
she is worried that cuts in cash - strapped @entity3 's health and social services could impact her nephew			2
@entity0 savors his moment with @entity40 , but says he still has unfinished business			1
" i hope he calls me so we can have a face - to - face meeting him and i. i have many things to tell him , " @entity0 said			1
one of the hallmarks of @entity40 ' papacy has been to call people , out of the blue			2
" what do you want to tell him ? " i asked			0
" that 's a bit private , " he said , shaking his head apologetically			0
" it 's between him and @entity3 " read more : @entity40 's embrace of man touches world read more : popular pope , but same old @entity175 ?			2
