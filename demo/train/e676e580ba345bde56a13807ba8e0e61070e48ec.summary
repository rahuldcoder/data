-- @entity3 's latest nuclear test , coming on the heels of december 's successful satellite launch , suggests that @entity6 is moving forward toward developing a nuclear warhead and a deliverable missile system , experts say			1
the question remains : how close is it ? the answer , like the cloistered " hermit kingdom , " remains largely a mystery , as does much of its nuclear program			0
" it 's a question over the delivery system and the reliability of those systems , " said @entity15 , senior analyst for the @entity16 covering @entity17			0
" that is essentially unknown , or known by a few people inside @entity3			0
" @entity25 rocket successfully puts satellite in orbit a 2009 report by @entity16 suggests that @entity3 " probably has somewhere between six and twelve nuclear weapons , or at least explosive devices , " but notes that experts are divided on whether any of these are now usable as warheads -- small enough to be mounted on missiles and durable enough to withstand the hazards of flight			1
" it 's pretty clear that these are advanced technologies and the systems present a number of engineering challenges -- and to master these technologies requires a number of tests , " @entity15 said			0
@entity3 on @entity44 : monuments , nuclear complex , gulags in december , on the first anniversary of the death of its former leader @entity50 , @entity3 successfully launched a three - stage rocket that put the satellite @entity53 - 3 into orbit			2
the launch also signaled that the @entity3 's long - range missile program now puts the @entity57 within reach			1
last month , the @entity60 @entity59 unanimously passed a resolution that strengthened sanctions against the @entity63 in response to the december rocket launch			1
declaring sanctions to be tantamount to " a declaration of war , " @entity3 threatened further missile and nuclear tests , which it said are a new phase of confrontation with the @entity57			2
for the @entity60 and @entity3 : game on tuesday 's underground nuclear test is @entity3 's third , following tests in 2009 and 2006			1
the test , " probably " conducted in the vicinity of @entity78 , yielded " several kilotons , " according to assessments cited by the @entity57 director of national intelligence			0
@entity81 in 2013 : watch the generational politics estimates of the size , or yield , of the 2009 nuclear test range from 2.5 kilotons to 6 kilotons , @entity15 said			2
by comparison , the atomic bomb dropped on @entity89 had a yield of 16 kilotons			0
while the specter of a @entity3 able to send nuclear - tipped missiles is worrisome , equally troublesome to the international community is @entity6 's atomic technology fueling the black market for weapons			1
" if its clandestine uranium - enrichment program has made strides , @entity6 could demonstrate that it will gain access to a far larger pool of fissile material than simply its limited supply of weapons - grade plutonium , " wrote @entity97 , an @entity17 expert at the @entity98 , in a @entity0 op - ed. " a larger pool of fissile material is a dual threat : as a vital part of an expanded nuclear weapon program and as a commodity to be sold on the black market			0
" timeline : @entity3 's rocket - fueled obsession @entity0 's @entity115 contributed to this report .			2

@entity3 says it carried out an underground nuclear test tuesday
it is the third nuclear test @entity6 has carried out since 2006
it comes after new @entity60 sanctions for @entity3 's december satellite launch
experts say it 's unknown how close the @entity63 is to being able to launch a nuclear warhead
