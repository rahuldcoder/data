-- ca n't wait until friday to check out the latest installment of the " @entity3 " film series ? well , if you have any knowledge of torrent sites at all , you should be able to view the first 36 minutes today , as a goodly chunk of the film has leaked online			1
the leak comes one day after the @entity11 premiere of the film			0
according to @entity16 , the beginning of " @entity3 and the @entity13 " ( the first installment of the two - part finale ) is currently available on dozens of torrent sites			1
a quick search by the staff of @entity0 proved this to be true			0
statement from @entity22 on leak this news is sure to cause a frenzy among @entity3 fans -- @entity16 reports that " @entity3 and the @entity31 " scored a spot on its " most pirated movies " list with nearly 8 million downloads last year			1
the book version of " @entity13 " also leaked -- back in 2007			1
so why is the cinematic leak only 36 minutes long ? @entity16 postulates that @entity22 feared a leak , so it limited the time of the screeners to ensure that the whole film did n't make it to the web			0
seeing as how the clip has hit the internet mere days before the premiere , we doubt it will have a negative effect on box office sales come friday -- unless , of course , those first 36 minutes are irrevocably horrible			0
the last time we saw a leak of this magnitude was probably that of " @entity51 , " which leaked a month early last year yet was still a box office success			2
what effect do you think the " @entity3 " leak will have on opening night ? Â© 2011 @entity0			2

the beginning of the new " @entity3 " movie is currently available on dozens of torrent sites
last year *'s* " @entity3 and the @entity31 " is one of the most pirated movies
