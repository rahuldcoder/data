-- @entity1 lent her name and her glittery profile to the cause of feminism at the @entity6 , and in the process got places that rarely cover this eight - letter " f " word to pay attention			1
" how can we effect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation ? " @entity1 said in a speech about gender equality that received a standing ovation and has gone viral			1
" men -- i would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation			2
gender equality is your issue , too , " she said			1
rarely do " @entity29 online " and @entity32 tweet the same speech			1
but this was n't just any speech			1
it focused on the role of men and questioned the demonization of the term " feminism			1
" " why has the word become such an uncomfortable one ? i think it is right i am paid the same as my male counterparts			2
i think it is right that i should make decisions about my own body			1
i think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life			2
i think it is right that socially , i am afforded the same respect as men , " @entity1 said			1
" my life is a sheer privilege because my parents did n't love me less because i was born a daughter			0
my school did not limit me because i was a girl			0
my mentors did n't assume that i would go less far because i might give birth to a child one day			0
these influences are the gender equality ambassadors that made me who i am today			1
they may not know it but they are the inadvertent feminists needed in the world today			1
we need more of those			0
" @entity1 gave the speech in light of the @entity6 launch of the @entity77 campaign , which aims to engage men to stop violence against women			1
we live in a world in which 100 million girls globally are expected to be married off before age 18 in the next 10 years , a world in which even in the @entity86 a girl can find herself plucked against her will from a @entity93 classroom and forced by relatives to marry against her will in a country she has never known , a world in which 31 million girls of elementary school age remain out of school , a world in which two - thirds of the world 's 774 million illiterate citizens are female			2
indeed , @entity1 's star is only the latest to illuminate the rebranding of feminism			1
as @entity105 wrote on @entity106 , @entity104 put the word " feminist " in a blaze of full - stage glory at the @entity111 , " making sunday the sixth - highest day for volume of conversation about feminism since @entity114 began tracking this year ( the top three were days during # @entity116 )			2
" @entity104 also penned a piece last year arguing that " men have to demand that their wives , daughters , mothers and sisters earn moreâ € ” commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender			2
equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect			0
" the question now is how to translate all the high - profile feminizing into visible , on - the - ground gains in the lives of ordinary women and men			0
the retaking of the " feminist " label by cultural luminaries lending their platform to the issue is laudable , but to date we have seen a lot of promise and much less progress			1
one example : on the media front women are embarrassingly absent from editorial pages still content to feature women 's voices a fraction of the time			0
women " are less likely than men to be sources or appear in authoritative roles in news stories , are depicted less frequently than males and less prominently , such as appearing further down in the columns , with fewer quotes or only paraphrased			0
" ( a recent @entity161 review of a @entity163 book noted that the author 's prose seemed " to have been borrowed from the pages of a women 's magazine			0
" rarely have i spotted such a reference to @entity170 or @entity171			0
) in entertainment , research from the @entity173 in @entity174 found in a survey of recently released films that there are " 2.24 male characters for every female character			0
only 30.9 % of the speaking characters are female			0
" on the economic front , " after a gradual rise in the 1980s and 1990s , the women 's - to - men 's earnings ratio peaked at 81 % in 2005 and 2006			0
" so , the talk about access to opportunity for everyone is terrific			0
but now comes the hard part : the action to make the change and in the process create a world that is fairer for everyone			1
one that does justice to the ambition of girls in any and every corner of the world , and to our own hopes for a more stable , secure and prosperous future			2
it will take a village			0
one boosted by a lot of high - wattage celebrities helping to light the way .			2

@entity1 gives a rousing speech at the @entity6 about gender *inequality*
@entity214 : @entity1 is the latest star to illuminate the rebranding of feminism
she says that to date we have seen a lot of promise and much less progress
@entity214 : the hard part is to take action and make changes to create a fairer world
