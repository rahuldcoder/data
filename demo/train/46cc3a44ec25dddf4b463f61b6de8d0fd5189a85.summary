-- the weeks have passed and , in most cases , their nerves have calmed			2
what began as shock , that they were almost victims of an in - flight terrorist attack , has morphed for many into contemplation			1
there are those who are still talking about what happened to them on christmas day , and there are others who are determined to put the incident behind them			2
the passengers of @entity18 may have been one faulty explosive away from disaster			1
the suspect in that incident , @entity22 - born @entity21 , 23 , pleaded not guilty in january to six federal terrorism charges			1
and he has been talking to authorities , thanks to help from his own family members			1
but what if the passengers could be part of that conversation ? what would they want to know or say to @entity21 , the government , the world ? @entity0 reached out by phone and e-mail to find out			1
more than anything , if they could sit down with @entity21 they would simply ask : why ? how did a young man who grew up with privilege , education and exposure to the greater world end up accused of attempting a terrorist attack ? " for me , these are the burning questions , " said @entity47 , 27 , who co-founded @entity48 , a company in @entity49 that hopes to help bring solar electricity to the 80 percent of @entity51 who have no electrical power			1
" i 've never had someone try to murder me , much less someone i did n't even know			2
so i 'm very interested in finding out more about [ his ] motives so that we might possibly figure out how to avert others from traveling down the same path			2
" could the fact that @entity21 is talking to officials signal he has regret , @entity47 wonders			1
if not , if he is a " lost cause , " @entity47 said he would n't care to waste breath speaking to him			0
" i do n't spend a lot of time seeking out conversations with @entity70 deniers , @entity72 fundamentalists or religious fanatics of any stripe , " he said			0
" i guess i 've decided that people that are beyond the pale of reason are simply that and nothing i say will convince them otherwise			0
" @entity81 , 31 , was sitting about an arm 's length from @entity21 when he was taken up to first class after the incident			1
she stared at him , and his blank expression			0
now she says she 'd rather speak to others considering the path he is accused of taking			1
" no matter what nationality we are or religion we choose , we are still people			0
i am a human being , a person that faces each day trying to make myself better and enrich the lives of people who know me , " said @entity94 , who 's lived the past year - and - a - half in @entity95 , @entity96 , where she works as a manufacturing project manager			1
" whether i live or die should not be decided on the whim of a person that wishes to brand all @entity107 as evil people			0
i am not defined by my nationality , but i believe in the goodness that resides in the people of every country			0
" not everyone would let @entity21 get away without hearing from them			1
if she could speak to him , @entity116 , a 32 - year - old attorney in @entity117 , would give him an earful			1
" you attempted to kill my husband and i , as well as 300 other individuals , and you do n't care at all , " are some of the words she said she 'd share			2
" you have taken away my carefree attitude about flying and have made me terrified to fly anyplace ever again			0
i do n't say this word much , because i do n't like it , but i completely and totally hate you and what you did to my family			0
i never believed in the death penalty until i saw you try to blow me up			2
" her anger is directed , too , at government authorities who she and others feel let them down			1
in the weeks that have followed the @entity139 incident , further information has come to light about what officials knew or should have known before @entity21 set foot on the airplane			1
@entity21 's father had met with @entity107 @entity147 officials and with the @entity148 to discuss concerns about his son			1
@entity107 intelligence reportedly knew about " the @entity22 " who had ties to @entity154 , and they even had a partial name of " @entity21			1
" @entity158 officers say he was on a list of people who should be questioned when entering the @entity107 they planned to talk to him once the aircraft landed in @entity163			0
but before they could do that , authorities say @entity21 attempted to ignite an explosive device hidden in his underwear			1
" i would ask [ officials ] to not get complacent ... just because we did n't die , " @entity94 said			0
" we were lucky , pure and simple			0
" added @entity170 , of the @entity96 , a 46 - year - old father who was traveling with his wife and two teens : " why were we forced to stay on the plane while they knew there might be a risk of another bomb on board ? why were we being held like cattle for almost seven hours without any information at all ? " his concern may be fueled by the helplessness he felt after his 13 - year - old daughter , seated directly behind @entity21 , leapt into his lap and grew hysterical			1
no one knew , when the flight landed , that there were no other explosives on board , and for this reason , @entity190 echoed similar concerns : " why did you allow the passengers to remain on the plane until you removed @entity21 ? why were we not your first priority ? " @entity190 , 51 , her husband and grown daughter were making their way home to @entity202 , @entity203 , with two new family additions in tow -- a boy and girl they 'd just adopted from @entity208			1
after the incident on the plane , as it descended into @entity163 , the family found comfort in their religious beliefs , joining hands and singing " @entity216			0
" in the aftermath , they still draw on their faith			0
" do not let people in this world filled with hatred stop you from experiencing everything this world has to offer			0
@entity231 is in control in the end , so you need not fear what ' might ' happen , but rest in knowing that you are in his hands , " she said , as a warning to others whose lives may be touched by terrorists			2
some people like @entity238 , who at 35 has dedicated his professional life to economic and rural development in places that have included @entity242 , do n't even want to think about this incident anymore			2
" i have put the experience behind me , " said @entity238 , who has witnessed up close the destruction of bombs , " and do not wish to revisit it at this point			0
" but at least one passenger , who said he remains " tormented " by the experience and " disappointed " in the government , wants not only to keep revisiting it but to get the passengers recognition for surviving it			1
@entity254 , a 38 - year - old real estate developer who lives in @entity255 , @entity256 , would like passengers to sign a petition so that they may all be honored by president @entity259 , the state of @entity117 , @entity261 and its parent company @entity262			1
he is convinced that it is because of the passengers -- " we were all heroes , " he said recently -- that @entity18 did n't become the next 9/11			1
" would we have been dead , " he said , " our spouses and children would have been guests at the @entity266 and @entity267 , receiving medals and @entity107 flags			0
" this kind of thinking bothers @entity170 , who fired off a response to @entity254 's request , saying , " it does not matter who did or did not do anything			0
fact of the matter is that we would not have been able to do anything at all if the igniter would have functioned properly			0
... we are victims of a failed terrorist attack			0
" lammerts said he and his family " are getting on with our lives and are just extra grateful for being alive , " and he told @entity254 , " i recommend you try and do the same			2
live your life to the fullest			2
" that 's a message that @entity47 , who is back in @entity288 , @entity49 , carries with him , too			0
" though this might sound strange , for me personally almost getting killed 30,000 feet above the earth by an @entity292 terrorist has been one of the best things that 's ever happened to me , " he said			0
" now being alive , seeing the blue sky , hearing the rain fall , eating a delicious meal , drinking a beer with a friend -- everyday stuff just feels like an amazing gift			2
... i feel as though i 've somehow cheated death and against all odds been given this gift of continuing my life			1
" and he recognizes this gift every single day			2
" i actually have my boarding pass framed now , and it 's sitting on my desk , right next to a little prayer book i keep with its page turned to @entity311 , " he said			0
" i keep it there simply to remind myself that whatever happens to me , things could always be far worse			0

@entity21 *allegedly* tried to *detonate* bomb on @entity18
as accused would - be bomber speaks to authorities , passengers share their thoughts
*frustration* with government and fear remains for some , while others move on
having " cheated death , " one passenger is grateful for " this gift of continuing my life "
