grossed $ 55.7 million during its first frame , according to early estimates from @entity11			1
" @entity6 " led the weekend box office , grossing $ 55.7 million during its first weekend			2
that 's a solid sum , to be sure , although it 's certainly on the low end of most projections			0
" @entity6 " premiered in more theaters ( 3,611 ) than any other r - rated movie in history , and it averaged an impressive $ 15,413 per venue , despite a potentially problematic long running time			1
it also scored the biggest debut of 2009 so far			0
nonetheless , the movie 's $ 55.7 million take ( including $ 5.5 million from 124 @entity26 screens ) is substantially smaller than the $ 70.9 million that 300 , the last r - rated graphic - novel movie from director @entity28 , earned on its opening weekend two years ago			1
and aside from that theater - count statistic ( which almost any film could break at any time , really ) , there will be no major records to report on this weekend ( for example , " @entity6 's " debut was just the fifth - best opening ever for an r - rated movie )			1
i 'd argue , in fact , that this opening is a bit soft , considering the great expectations that came with @entity28 's adaptation of @entity43 's landmark comic book -- not to mention " @entity6 's " hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on friday and throughout its first day			2
after attracting some major initial interest , banking $ 25.1 million on friday , the film 's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend : it grossed $ 19 million on saturday and is expected to bring in just $ 11.5 million on sunday			1
these are all big numbers , do n't get me wrong , but , when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm @entity55 grade of b from an audience that was largely comprised of older men , it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come			0
elsewhere -- yes , there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend ! -- a number of films continued to do what " @entity6 " must now aspire to , perhaps in vain : they stayed strong deep into their long runs			0
@entity70 's " @entity69 " ( no. 2 ) grossed $ 8.8 million on its third weekend ; the film , @entity70 's biggest yet at the box office , has banked $ 76.5 million to date			1
" taken " ( no. 3 ) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now , earning $ 7.5 million and bringing its six - week sum to $ 118 million			2
@entity79 winner " @entity80 " ( no. 4 ) was next with $ 6.9 million , which boosted its domestic haul to $ 125.4 million			1
and " @entity83 : @entity88 " ( no. 5 ) took its eight - week total to $ 133.6 million thanks to another $ 4.2 million gross			2
ireport.com : what did you think of ' @entity6 ' ? meanwhile , " @entity92 : the @entity94 " ( no. 9 ) completely fell off the map , dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $ 2.8 million			1
according to @entity96 , that 's the 15th biggest second - weekend decline of all time			0
overall , the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago , when 10,000 @entity100 opened big , making this the fifth consecutive " up " weekend at the multiplex			0
so , all in all , i 'd say today 's was a good report , indeed			0
