-- @entity1 has called reports of a @entity4 tour " rubbish , " and now @entity6 is doing the same			1
on his blog wednesday , the @entity8 founder said he 's " dazed and confused " by rumors that he offered an $ 800 million ( Â £ 500 million ) contract to see @entity4 re-form for a reunion tour			1
" as much as i love the band , there is absolutely no truth to the story , " @entity6 said			1
and despite what you may have heard , @entity17 is n't going to rename a plane " and include a stairway to heaven " in @entity4 's honor , @entity6 added			1
" however nice an idea , this is also completely untrue			2
" the report that @entity6 was involved in a @entity4 reunion appeared in the @entity27 this week and claimed that @entity6 was eager to cart the band around in one of his jets as part of a tour that would hit @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
it was said that @entity4 's @entity38 and @entity39 were all in for the deal along with @entity41 , the son of the band 's late drummer , @entity42			2
the holdout , the @entity27 reported , was lead singer @entity1			0
" @entity38 , @entity42 and @entity41 signed up immediately , " a source told the paper			0
" it was a no - brainer for them but @entity1 asked for 48 hours to think about it			0
when he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given , there was an enormous sense of shock			0
there is no way they can go ahead without him			0
" " rubbish , " was @entity1 's publicist 's response to the story , which appears to have been removed from the @entity27 's website			2
@entity6 is taking it a step further			2
not only is it untrue , he says in his blog post , but it diminishes the band members ' current careers			1
" making up this story is very disrespectful to how wonderful ( @entity1 's ) solo career with the @entity71 is going , " @entity6 said			1
" he is setting out on a sold out tour today and they released a brilliant album last year			0
... @entity1 told me he is very proud of his history and the band 's past , and has always had great respect and love for his work throughout his career			2
however , he really believes he must move on with his life and career today			0
" legends like @entity4 are once - in - a - lifetime creators , but that does n't mean they should be restricted to simply rehashing their old stuff ; @entity38 and @entity39 also have their own projects in the works , @entity6 pointed out			1
" i 'm proud of how so many artists from my generation , whether it is @entity4 , @entity95 or @entity96 , are still being so creative and inventive , " @entity6 said			1
" as @entity1 told me : ' @entity97 , i just do things because i love them and i want to do more new things that i love			0
' i could n't agree more			0
" @entity0 's @entity100 contributed to this report .			0
