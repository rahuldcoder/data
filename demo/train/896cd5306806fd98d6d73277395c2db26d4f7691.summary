other areas the security services would look at , he added , would include which groups -- if any -- were behind the attack and whether it was home - grown			1
@entity15 said that there had been plots in the past when attackers had tried to target military personnel : the fact that wednesday 's murder happened near a military barracks in southeast @entity0 was significant			1
" it 's not clear if this particular officer was specifically targeted or he just happened to be walking through this area and was a target of opportunity , " said @entity15 , " but it seems that more than one individual was part of this attack , so this could well have been planned			2

this @entity7 soldier is an @entity67 , a tooth for tooth			1
" @entity70 cited the plot , uncovered in 2007 , to kidnap and murder a @entity65 @entity7 soldier			1
four men plotted to kidnap a solider on leave and then decapitate him in a garage			2
