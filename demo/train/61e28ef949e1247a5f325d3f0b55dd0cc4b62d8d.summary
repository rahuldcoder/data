-- the acquittal of @entity2 , 29 , means he 's a free man and will be able to walk out of the courthouse because he 's no longer in police custody			1
he will be free , if he chooses , to leave @entity5 , @entity6			1
but one of his attorneys , @entity7 , has said that @entity2 is a marked man and lives in fear for his life			1
jury acquits @entity2 in fact , during court proceedings , @entity2 did n't disclose where he had been residing for more than a year , and he dared to venture outdoors only when in disguise			1
@entity2 also wore body armor			1
" i believe his life is at risk , and i do n't say that for dramatic effect , " @entity7 said before the verdict			0
" there are a lot of people who think @entity2 killed @entity26 for racial reasons , even though nothing supports that			1
and if they feel that anger enough , they could react violently			0
" it 's doubtful that @entity2 would be able to return to his pursuit of a career in law enforcement			1
he was enrolled in @entity36 at the time of the february 26 , 2012 , shooting			0
share your reaction one expert advised against such a plan for @entity2			1
" that is the absolute worst thing you can do , " said @entity43 , a reputation management counselor in @entity45			0
" it might be your old passion			0
my advice would be , you need to find a new passion			0
and it needs to be helping people in a very different way , a way that is much more compassionate , not just involving law enforcement			1
" @entity2 -- who is married but has no children -- may choose to resume his career in mortgage insurance or in an undergraduate education			1
it remains to be seen whether his post-acquittal life could parallel that of another high - profile defendant found not guilty : @entity65 , the @entity6 woman accused of killing her 2 - year - old daughter in 2008			1
" you never know who the nuts are or where they are , " said @entity68 , a defense attorney for @entity69			0
" there are still people that threaten me			0
" @entity68 acknowledged that when the court of public opinion deems a defendant guilty , life can be very difficult			0
@entity2 apparently enjoys support from his parents and immediate family , some of whom testified in his defense			1
he has been able to pay for his defense by raising thousands of dollars from the public			0
but crisis public relations manager @entity89 said @entity2 must tread carefully when accepting further public money			1
" he 's got to be careful to avoid the appearance of creating more divisions by accepting money or support openly from groups that maybe that would create more friction because of the tenor of this case , " @entity89 said			1
" he 's got to be careful about who he associates with afterwards , even if they are offering financial support			0
" the three - week trial ignited a national debate about race relations			0
@entity26 , an @entity106 , was walking through a gated community in @entity108 , @entity6 , to his father 's fiancee 's house when a confrontation occurred between him and @entity113			2
@entity2 , a neighborhood watch captain , called 911 to report " a suspicious person " in the neighborhood			2
despite the dispatcher 's instructions not to get out of his vehicle , @entity2 exits his suv , and an exchange unfolded between @entity26 and @entity2			2
neighbors heard a single shot fired			0
@entity2 asserted he shot @entity26 in self - defense as @entity26 beat his head against the concrete sidewalk			2
@entity2 , who describes himself as @entity126 , has a @entity128 mother and white @entity130 father			2
he has been free on bail since last july			0
initially , @entity108 police did n't charge @entity2 because they said they had no grounds to disprove his account			2
led by @entity26 's family , a public uproar ensued , in which even president @entity137 remarked that the incident required " soul - searching			0
" then , almost two months after the shooting , a special prosecutor charged @entity2 with second - degree murder .			2

@entity2 is free to leave @entity6 but might face a life as a marked man
expert advises @entity2 not to return to pursuit of law enforcement career
