@entity0 -- @entity2 has a nagging reminder of the cycling crash that could have killed her			1
a year and a half later , flecks of asphalt remain lodged in her skin			1
there 's also the metal pole extending from her kneecap down to her ankle , along with countless screws , keeping her left leg intact			1
" my body was destroyed , " said @entity2 , an artist living in @entity15			2
" my whole life was put on hold for months , and no one seemed to care			0
" it happened in october , 2010 , on what @entity2 and her boyfriend , @entity22 , thought was an innocuous bike ride home from a concert			1
" i was riding in front of @entity2 , about 10 feet in front of her , " @entity27 said			0
" i heard a loud scraping , scratching noise , there was a second of blackness , and then i was flying through the air			0
" what had lofted @entity27 into the air was a speeding driver who , according to witnesses , fled the scene			0
@entity27 hobbled to his feet , noted the mangled remains of his bike and scanned the area for @entity2			1
when he did not see her , he panicked			0
" i was screaming her name , " @entity27 said			0
" then i saw her lying in the middle of the right - hand lane of the road ... at that time i did n't know if she was alive			1
" no charges have been filed in the case			0
@entity2 's story is a reminder of a growing problem in many of the nation 's busy , sprawling urban landscapes : more people are using bikes for transportation amid a culture and infrastructure designed for automobiles			0
although @entity0 police and the city 's @entity73 report increasing bicyclists , the number of bike deaths has remained steady			1
in fact , overall traffic deaths have dropped by 39 % since 2001 , according to the @entity77			2
but that statistic offers little comfort to @entity2			0
it 's not just the facts of the incident -- or even the tiny particles of debris from the @entity0 street still in @entity2 's body -- that have left her upset			1
it 's what @entity2 describes as investigative inertia by the @entity77 when it came to her case			0
" there were no legal repercussions for the driver whatsoever , because the @entity77 chose not to investigate the hit - and - run , " @entity2 said			1
" it blows my mind that this is even possible ... people get in worse trouble for double - parking			2
" in 2010 , in more than 6,000 @entity0 traffic accidents involving cyclists , 36 people died , according to the state @entity104			1
@entity106 reported that no criminal charges were filed against the drivers involved			0
one woman -- the mother of an artist named @entity111 , who was killed on a bike -- is on a crusade to learn more about his death and to make roads safer for cyclists			2
there is a growing sense among the city 's cycling community that to many authorities , bicyclists do n't matter			1
" cyclists and pedestrians are being killed and seriously injured all over our city , once every 35 hours in fact , " @entity0 councilman @entity127 said at a hearing this year			1
" and the drivers are literally getting away with it			0
" @entity1 repeatedly contacted the @entity77 for comment about @entity2 's hit - and - run and the department 's policy about cycling accident investigations , but did not receive a response			1
cyclists who think police are biased against them are fueled by another statistic : in 2011 , the @entity77 issued 10,415 criminal court summonses to truck operators			2
during the same year , 34,813 summonses were issued to bicyclists			1
" while there may be some lawbreaking among the cycling population , very few if any of those transgressions of the law are resulting in death or serious injury , " said @entity147 , executive director of @entity148 , a bicycling advocacy group			2
" but when a trucker runs the red light or speeds , the consequences very often are deadly			0
" there are also problems , in the eyes of lawmakers and advocates alike , with how crashes are investigated			0
according to statements made by the @entity77 , only traffic accidents involving imminent or actual death are investigated			1
those cases are handled by one of 19 members of a special unit called the @entity174 , or @entity174			0
" their role is to utilize their special training to conduct a more comprehensive investigation , employing a variety of techniques in order to establish speed , analyze skid marks and other physical characteristics of the accident scene , " said @entity175 , executive officer of the @entity176 of the @entity77 , at a @entity178 hearing in february			0
" in essence , reconstruct the accident so that a more definitive cause , possibly resulting in criminal charges , may be determined			0
" but with only 19 detectives , @entity174 resources are stretched , so members of the unit are not always deployed , even when death is imminent , according to activists			0
" staffing for these crashes is not what it should be , " said @entity201 , an attorney with @entity202 and @entity203 , a law firm specializing in cases involving bicycling accidents			2
" this resource is not what it should be if we 're going to have these investigations			0
" the issue has hit the blogosphere			2
advocates are pushing for a law that would force police to investigate all serious bike accidents			1
for @entity2 and @entity224 , virtually no investigation of their case occurred , they say			0
that leaves @entity2 , who still struggles with a debilitating injury to her left leg , with little legal recourse after her accident			1
" if you lose your limbs in a [ bike ] crash , you do n't get an investigation , " said @entity147 , the bicycling advocate			1
" without that investigation , it 's virtually impossible to hold reckless drivers accountable when they do break traffic laws and they seriously injure pedestrians or cyclists			2
" perhaps not surprisingly , a year and a half after her hit - and - run , @entity2 has refused to ride a bike .			1
