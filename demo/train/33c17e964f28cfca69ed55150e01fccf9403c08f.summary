@entity0 , @entity1 -- the man who authorities say shot and wounded two police officers outside the @entity6 thursday before he was fatally shot had a history of mental health problems and a penchant for spouting anti-government conspiracy theories			1
@entity11 repeatedly tangled with police in recent months , while his relationship with his parents -- whom he lived with in a gated community in @entity16 -- grew increasingly contentious			2
" there 's a history of mental health problems with him that the family 's been dealing with for a number of years , " @entity17 , @entity16 , sheriff @entity18 said friday			1
@entity25 , 36 , suffered from bipolar disorder , according to court records from a 2006 @entity16 arrest for a man by the same name			1
that man 's birth date matches the one authorities gave for the @entity6 shooter			1
@entity25 had been committed to mental institutions at least three or four times , according to @entity18			1
his ties to family had grown strained since late last year			2
two months ago , @entity25 's parents filed a missing person report about him , although he returned and the report was canceled two weeks later , @entity18 said			1
@entity25 's mother had also come across " some information -- either from an e-mail received from a company , or an online posting on a bank account or something -- where on the 10th of january he had made a $ 600 purchase at a shooting range in the @entity54 area in @entity16 , " @entity18 said			1
@entity25 would not tell her what he bought , he said			1
on friday the @entity57 said they believe that @entity25 drove to @entity58 , and parked his car in a garage near the @entity6			1
@entity25 " was very well dressed in a suit " and showed " no distress in his appearance " as he approached a screening area to enter @entity6 grounds about 6:40 p.m. thursday evening , @entity6 police chief @entity61 said			1
" he walked very directly to the officers and engaged , " @entity61 said			0
" he was very well armed			0
i will tell you that he had two 9 mm semiautomatic weapons and many magazines			0
" on friday , a picture emerged of @entity25 as a troubled man with an intense interest in science			2
on the social networking web site @entity78 , a profile page for a @entity80 @entity11 in the @entity81 -- where @entity25 's family lives -- described him as an " msee student , " short for master of science in @entity86			1
the page said he graduated from the @entity88 with a bachelor 's degree in physics in 1994			0
the @entity78 page said that @entity25 attended @entity92 from 1995 to 1996 , but that he did not get a degree there			2
in the missing person report filed in january , @entity25 's father said he worked in the @entity98 area but that he did not know where			1
@entity18 , the @entity17 sheriff , said the @entity25 family filed the missing person report on january 4 , a day after @entity25 was stopped in @entity103 for speeding as he traveled west			1
the @entity103 highway patrolman used @entity25 's cell phone to call @entity25 's family , @entity18 said			1
" the highway patrolman wanted to know a little more information about him because when he stopped him for speeding , when he came up to the car , the interior of the vehicle was in ' disarray , ' " @entity18 said			0
the patrolman spoke with @entity25 's mother , then gave him a warning and sent him on his way , @entity18 said			1
the sheriff said the stop prompted the family to file the missing person report , @entity18 said			0
in filing the report , @entity25 's father said @entity11 had been staying at an unknown address in @entity98 after getting into a fight with his brother three weeks earlier			1
it was n't @entity25 's first blowout with his brother			1
in july 2006 , @entity25 got into an altercation with @entity128 and signed a citizen 's arrest to have him taken to jail and booked , @entity18 said			1
a week after @entity25 's father filed the missing report in january , the parents called the police to say their son had shown up			1
authorities went to the family 's home , where the parents said @entity25 " appeared to be impaired , delusional , and agitated , " according to @entity18			1
" the agitation ... was due to his mother asking him questions [ such as ] , ' where have you been ? what have you been doing ? ' " @entity18 said			0
she also asked him about the $ 600 purchase at the shooting range , he said			0
" when she asked him to give her some details about what that purchase was , that 's when he became agitated and left the residence , " @entity18 said			0
authorities arrived after he had left , and although they gave out information on him to law enforcement agencies , they were not able to find him , @entity18 said			0
the family told authorities that he had a " history of mental illness			2
" on january 18 , @entity25 's father told authorities his son had returned home and that the missing person report should be canceled , @entity18 said			1
according to the police report , @entity25 was staying at an unknown address after stopping at home			2
a couple weeks later , on february 1 , @entity25 was picked up by police in @entity165 , @entity166 , and charged with marijuana possession			2
his court date was tuesday , but @entity25 failed to show up			2
court records from @entity16 show that investigators arrested a @entity172 in june 2006 on charges of cultivating marijuana and resisting arrest			2
" i sincerely request the court not find the offense to reflect a propensity for violence on my part , " he said in a signed statement in the case			0
" i was experiencing an episode of mental illness ( bipolar disorder ) during the event in question			0
" court documents from the 2006 case also include a statement from @entity25 's psychiatrist confirming @entity25 suffered from bipolar disorder and describing him as " relatively symptom - free when under medication			1
" in an internet posting , @entity195 referred to being arrested in 2006 on marijuana charges			0
" given my belief that cannabis prohibition is the least defensible and most unjust aspect of the prohibitionist regime existing throughout the world today , i decided in march 2006 to cultivate cannabis in full view of the world , " the person said in a 2006 podcast			0
@entity25 appears to have been the same man who had railed against the government repeatedly on the @entity210			1
through podcasts and a wikipedia page , a man identified online as @entity195 cast the government as a criminal force destroying personal liberties			0
" this seizure of the @entity222 government by an international criminal conspiracy is a long - established reality , " the man said in a podcast in november 2006 , which also was published as text online			0
such an organization , the man said , " would use its powers to convert military , intelligence , and law enforcement bureacracies ( sic ) into instruments for political control and the domination and subjection of society , while discrediting , destroying , and murdering honest individuals within those services that work to root out corruption and faithfully serve their fellow citizens			0
" in a video posted on @entity243 in october 2006 , a man identified as jpbedell talked about his idea for " information currency , " which he said would " create a financial market for information			0
" the man in the video is the same man shown in a photograph of the shooter released friday by the @entity57			0
the man 's voice in the @entity243 video also sounds similar to the voice in the podcasts			0
a person using the screen name @entity195 wrote about the same idea on a wikipedia page that was taken down early friday			0
the @entity17 sheriff read a statement from the family on friday , saying that they were " devastated " by thursday 's news			1
" to the outside world , this tragedy is the first and only thing they will know of @entity11 ; to us he was a beloved son , brother , grandson , nephew and cousin , " the family said , according to @entity18			0
" we may never know why he made this terrible decision			0
one thing is certain , though , his actions were caused by an illness and not a defective character			1
" they expressed hope for a quick recovery of the two wounded officers , and asked that the family 's privacy be respected			1
" this is a well - respected longtime local family , " @entity18 told @entity2 on friday			0
" they 're a middle -- upper - middle class folks who are well known in the community			0
they 're a good solid family			0
" @entity18 said that @entity25 's father is a financial advisor and that his mother works at the local branch of the @entity16 - based @entity298			1
at a news conference friday morning , @entity299 , the @entity6 police chief , said @entity6 and @entity303 cameras of the area show the gunman in the time leading up to the shooting			2
he showed " no real emotion in his face " as he approached the officers , @entity61 said			0
he approached the officers thursday evening and , when asked for identification , pulled a gun out of his pocket and began shooting , authorities said			2
officers @entity317 and @entity319 returned fire with semiautomatic weapons , said @entity6 spokesman @entity322			1
the two wounded officers had superficial injuries and were released from a hospital , officials said			2
when officers located @entity25 's vehicle at a nearby parking garage , they found more ammunition inside , @entity61 said			1
authorities do not know what the man 's motive may have been , he said			0
several versions of a 2004 scientific proposal to the @entity337 , attributed to @entity25 , exist in multiple locations on the @entity210			2
a 28 - page version of the proposal , " @entity341 for @entity342 , " lists @entity25 as the sole employee for the project and estimates he would work 1,000 hours at $ 30 an hour for a total of $ 30,000			2
the proposal was a response to an april 2004 call from the @entity349 ( @entity349 ) , which provides research grants for projects related to defense			0
it was not clear if @entity25 ever submitted the proposal			2
a @entity349 spokesperson would not confirm whether the proposal was received , saying the agency could legally comment only on proposals it funded			0
" investigators are searching the car , conducting interviews and reviewing a video of the shooting in an effort to piece together a timeline of @entity25 's activities leading up the incident , " the @entity57 said in a news release			1
@entity2 's @entity369 and @entity370 contributed to this report .			0

@entity172 's family says " actions were caused by an illness "
@entity25 appears to have railed against government repeatedly on internet
