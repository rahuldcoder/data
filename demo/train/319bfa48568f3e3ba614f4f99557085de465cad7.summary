-- @entity1 rode the swirling social and political currents of @entity3 in the late 1960s and early 1970s to lead a political movement that permanently changed the nation in ways that we still do not fully understand			1
a mild - mannered @entity9 intellectual , @entity11 combat hero and son of a @entity14 minister , he became the leading edge of a storm promising ( or threatening , depending on your point of view ) transformative change on a wide range of issues including foreign policy , the electoral process and the rights of women			1
it was a storm that gathered intense support and equally intense opposition in the senator 's run for president against incumbent @entity32 in 1972			1
while the nation 's younger and more highly educated rallied to @entity1 's standard , the " silent majority " were deeply troubled by much of what they believed to be the @entity38 agenda			1
@entity1 , an unabashed liberal voice , dies ultimately , much of what @entity1 campaigned for in 1972 came to pass			1
both major political parties have a system of nominating a president that is far more transparent , accountable and democratic than the systems that existed prior to 1972			2
@entity1 was instrumental in rewriting the rules for selecting @entity50 convention delegates to include women , minorities and young people			1
( women , minorities and gays now have far more rights and protections than they did in 1972			1
) but the cutting edge of the 1972 campaign was about how @entity3 dealt with the rest of the world , how it chose and challenged its adversaries , and in particular , how it would resolve the @entity64			0
by gaining the @entity50 nomination , @entity1 became the leading opponent of the war ; he challenged the usefulness of the 25 - year strategy of containing the @entity70 , the @entity71 and any other nation committed to or influenced by @entity73			2
@entity1 and many other political leaders in both parties argued that in opposing communism or other types of totalitarianism , the @entity3 had to be far more strategic -- that fighting in places like @entity80 , where the outcome would have little real consequence on our nation 's global struggle against a failed ideology , squandered @entity3 lives and treasure			1
@entity89 : mcgovern a strong man who overcame defeat while the @entity32 administration and conservative republicans lambasted @entity1 for those views , @entity32 eventually signed a peace agreement that ended the war on terms no more favorable than would have been granted had the @entity98 been adopted in 1970 -- an amendment that proposed a complete withdrawal of troops from @entity80 and would have saved thousands of @entity3 combat casualties			1
here is part of the passionate speech -- bracingly relevant today -- that @entity1 delivered on the @entity107 floor before the vote defeating the amendment : " every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young americans to an early grave			1
this chamber reeks of blood			0
every senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at @entity118 and @entity119 and all across our land â € ” young men without legs , or arms , or genitals , or faces or hopes			0
" there are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure			0
do not talk to them about bugging out , or national honor or courage			0
it does not take any courage at all for a congressman , or a senator , or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in @entity80 , because it is not our blood that is being shed			0
but we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes			0
and if we do not end this damnable war , those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the executive carry the burden that the @entity152 places on us			0
" so before we vote , let us ponder the admonition of @entity154 , the great parliamentarian of an earlier day : ' a contentious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood			0
' " highlights of @entity1 's life today , @entity3 businesses are seeking to broaden our commercial relationships with @entity80 , and @entity3 military advisers meet with the @entity80 to suggest strategies that will help that country protect the territory it claims in the @entity165 from possible @entity71 aggression			1
@entity1 never fully recovered from the drubbing he received at the polls in november of 1972			2
but the path that he pointed to was ultimately the path the country took , and the movement he founded drew thousands of men and women , who committed their lives to public service and who continue to contribute to their communities and their country 40 years later			2
@entity1 was never the extremist his opponents tried to characterize him as being			1
his subsequent electoral success in @entity182 was evidence enough of that fact			0
but he was a man of great vision and grace			2
he helped to educate a generation about the failures of a rigid and untextured accounting of our allies and our enemies , and about the importance of making smart choices when dealing with dangerous adversaries			0
those are lessons as important today as they were in 1970			0
politicians pay tribute the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity202 : @entity1 *presciently* rode swirling political , social currents of late ' 60s , early ' 70s
his views on foreign policy , women 's rights and more drew support of young , @entity206 says
@entity1 lost to @entity32 in 1972 , but many of his positions came to pass anyway , @entity206 says
lilly : @entity1 not the extremist his opponents claimed ; he was a man of *strength* , grace
