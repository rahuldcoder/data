@entity0 -- a @entity4 ethics investigative panel has charged a high - ranking @entity6 congresswoman with violating @entity4 rules by seeking federal assistance for a bank with financial ties to her husband			1
according to the @entity15 , @entity14 rep. @entity13 helped arrange a meeting in september 2008 between @entity18 - based @entity17 and @entity20 officials			1
@entity17 ultimately received $ 12 million in bailout funds			0
@entity22 is a senior member of the @entity23			2
@entity22 , according to a preliminary report , called then - treasury secretary @entity25 during the height of the financial crisis " and requested that @entity20 officials meet with representatives from the @entity30 , " an organization representating over 100 minority - owned banks			2
" a meeting was in fact granted , however , the discussion at the meeting focused on a single bank -- @entity17			0
rep. @entity22 ' husband had been a board member of the bank from 2004 to 2008 and , at the time of the meeting , was a stock holder of the bank			1
" the report states that @entity22 approached @entity23 chairman @entity45 , @entity18 , to say that she was " in a predicament because her husband had been involved in the bank , but ' @entity17 people ' were coming to her for help			1
" @entity22 , " according to ( @entity45 ) ... knew she should say no , but it bothered her			2
it was clear to ( @entity45 ) that this was a ' conflict of interest problem			0
' " @entity45 's advice to @entity22 , the report states , was to ' stay out of it			2
' " according to @entity22 ' 2008 financial disclosure statement -- as mentioned in the report -- her husband had two investments in @entity17 at the time valued between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million			1
" there is substantial reason to believe that rep. @entity22 ' conduct may have violated " @entity4 rules , the report concludes			1

" i have not violated any @entity4 rules , " she said in a statement released monday			1
" i simply will not be forced to admit to something i did not do			0
" @entity22 asserted that " the record will clearly show that in advocating on behalf of minority banks neither my office nor i benefited in any way , engaged in improper action or influenced anyone			0
... the case against me has no merit			0
" @entity22 stressed that the meeting " was requested and scheduled on behalf of the ( @entity30 ) , not on behalf of @entity17 as has been suggested			0
" the announcement by the ethics committee means @entity22 may now face a trial by committee members tasked with determining whether there is " clear and convincing evidence " she broke congressional rules			1
also facing a possible ethics committee trial : rep. @entity97 , @entity99 - @entity98			1
@entity97 , the former chairman of the tax - writing @entity100 , has been accused of 13 violations of @entity4 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity105			1
both trials could take place in september -- only a few weeks before the midterm elections			0
the prospect of inquiries into two high - profile @entity6 has compounded the fears of congressional democrats nervous about their prospects in november			0
the growing likelihood of trials for @entity22 and @entity97 also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation			2
both representatives are leaders of the @entity120 , and @entity17 is one of the largest minority - owned banks in @entity123			0
