-- the court of public opinion has hardly been supportive of @entity3 , but the 77 - year - old comedian still has his defenders			1
last week , singer @entity6 engaged with several people on her @entity9 account after being approached to sign a petition asking @entity11 to cut its ties with @entity3			1
@entity3 , who attended the school and served on its board , has been accused of rape by a number of women in recent weeks			1
through his attorneys , he has repeatedly denied the claims			2
@entity3 facing litany of allegations " oh ok			1
so they 've proven the alleged allegations ? i did n't know			0
will they also be giving him back the millions he 's donated ? " @entity27 tweeted to the petition request			0
on sunday , @entity27 responded to criticism with another tweet			0
" u know @entity3 ? i do child and this is insane			1
period , " she wrote			0
@entity3 resigned from the @entity11 board of trustees on monday , but his @entity9 account , @ @entity39 , took note of @entity27 's support wednesday morning			1
" thank you @ @entity43 , from the @entity44 , " read the tweet			0
on the november 17 edition of " @entity48 , " @entity46 said that people should be skeptical of what they hear			1
" quite honestly , you know , look , i 'm sorry , having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something , it does n't matter now , " @entity46 said after the " view " panel discussed the allegations of @entity3 accuser @entity54			1
" the cat is out of the bag ; people have it in their heads			0
i have a lot of questions for the lady			0
maybe she 'll come on			0
" " thank you @ @entity71 , " responded @ @entity39 on tuesday			0
@entity3 also received support from comedian @entity73 , though @entity73 's tweets have been more inflammatory			1
" you sorry porch monkey deserve everything you get ... you gon na stand up for this b * tch and and not a man like mr. @entity3 , " he wrote on november 22 in response to a person criticizing @entity3			1
after some back and forth , @entity73 said he does n't believe in trying @entity3 in the media			2
" let me be clear , i do n't support rape , but @ billcosby has been convicted in the media & that is unjust as well # @entity88 , " @entity73 tweeted			2
love even went so far as to post " i support @entity3 " in large letters on his @entity92 account			1
the stories of @entity3 's purported crimes have been around for about a decade , but in the past two months , they 've received new life , stoked particularly by a routine by comedian @entity98 that went viral and a social media stunt that went awry			2
at least 18 women have spoken publicly accusing the comedian of sexual misconduct , and many of the women say he drugged them before he raped them			2
some of the alleged attacks took place decades ago			0
@entity3 's attorney , @entity107 , has repeatedly denied the claims			2
@entity107 said in a statement to @entity0 that it defies common sense that " so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			0
" on tuesday , a woman named @entity120 filed a lawsuit in @entity122 , claiming sexual battery and infliction of emotional distress during an incident at the @entity127 , according to the documents first obtained by @entity129 ( @entity130 )			0
the alleged sexual assault took place in 1974 , when @entity120 was 15 years old			0
@entity133 , a crisis management strategist , does n't think the celebrity support will make much difference in changing the public 's opinion of @entity3			1
" the public impression made by @entity3 's continuous pr blunders , compounded by the parade of accusers giving detailed accounts , it 's certainly created an image that i believe is beyond character endorsements by celebrity personalities , " he said			1
" there are some loyal friends that , while you respect them standing by their man , ( @entity3 's ) actions -- or inactions -- speak louder than their words			2
" @entity0 's @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this story .			0
