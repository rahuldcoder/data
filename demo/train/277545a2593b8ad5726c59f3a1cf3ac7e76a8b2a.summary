@entity1 , @entity0 -- police on the picturesque island of @entity5 in the @entity6 detained a 68 - year - old man tuesday as part of their investigation into alleged abuses at a long - closed government - run children 's home			1
a woman walks past the @entity17 children 's home			1
spokeswoman @entity18 said the man was helping authorities with their inquiries into " a number of historic rapes and indecent assaults			1
" but , @entity18 added , the man 's detention was not " directly related " to the @entity17 children 's home			1
rather , he is part of a wider inquiry into abuses that authorities are investigating , she said			0
" we can now also confirm that the alleged offenses in question took place in the 1960s and 1970s , " she said			1
" we are not able to say at this time where the offenses took place			0
" @entity18 did not release the man 's name or disclose any other details			1
the man has not been charged with a crime , @entity18 said			1
@entity5 is a @entity45 crown dependency , located 14 miles off the coast of @entity47 near @entity48			0
in january , police arrested another man -- a former warden who was charged with three counts of indecent assault on underage girls in the late 60s and early 70s			1
the man , 76 - year - old @entity54 , has not entered a plea yet , @entity18 said			1
the announcement in january that fragments of a child 's skull had been discovered under a stairwell in the building has sparked more than 160 allegations of child abuse there dating back to the 1960s , authorities say			1
the building opened in 1867 and housed up to 60 children at any one time			1
it underwent several renovations and closed in 1986 only to reopen as a youth hostel in 2004			0
possible clues to the abuse alleged to have occurred inside include writing found on a wall that " refers to somebody being bad , " @entity5 deputy police chief @entity73 said in february			1
" we have no idea at the moment who put it there or , indeed , how long it 's been there			2
" police said much of what they found , including shackles , matches accounts given by witnesses			2
several former residents allege they suffered physical and sexual abuse in a storeroom			2
police suspect there could be four bricked - up chambers underground			1
several alleged victims have talked about abuse occurring in a large concrete trough in the basement , which was originally the first floor of the building			1
in february , authorities said they had compiled " well over 40 " suspects who are alive , and a number of others who are dead			2
the investigation has taken officials to @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity45 mainland			0
some of those who have reported abuse have taken their complaints to the news media			2
" there was one occasion , in the sick bay , where i was made to fondle another boy -- if you did n't , you were threatened you would n't come out alive , " said @entity114 , who said he was taken to the home at the age of 5 and said one of his friends committed suicide after being raped there			2
" you 'd go to bed at night , sleeping , and all of a sudden your arms would be held down and the next thing you know you 're getting raped , " recalled @entity128 , who spent the first 12 years of his life there			0
" you were subject to constant abuse			2
... it was every night , and you were scared to go to bed			0
" @entity137 , a local politician , told @entity2 the building had long been known " as a place where young boys were punished severely , where they suffered			0
" he alleged a " long - established culture of covering up alleged abuses " -- a claim the local government denies			1
the investigation began in 2006 , when police were alerted to the possibility that pedophiles had worked at the institution			2
that led to the discovery of the skull fragment			0
the institution housed wards of the state -- primarily neglected and abandoned children			0
a remand wing housed children who had been convicted of crimes			0
the allegations mar the carefully cultivated image the island 's elite have tried to project			0
@entity5 's beaches have made it a big tourist destination , and its offshore banks have made it a tax haven and a playground for the rich			0
eleven miles long and 9 miles wide , the island is populated by about 80,000 mostly white , affluent residents			0
heavily influenced by the @entity48 , the largely autonomous island has its own legal system and its own currency			0
@entity1 manages only its defense and foreign policy matters			0
