-- even rote fantasy blockbusters can — and usually do — feature the showdown of good and evil			2
to conjure true darkness , however , is a trickier feat. early on in " @entity6 : the @entity15 , " @entity7 ( @entity8 ) , having proved his mettle as a budding thief and honorary comrade to @entity13 's band of dwarves , finds himself at the top of a tree in the forest of @entity19 , where he spies an idyllic vista of autumn leaves			1
then he drops into a huge , sticky web , and a pack of giant spiders attempt to eat him alive			2
these monster arachnids have a fearful presence , like something out of a nightmare devised by @entity30			2
a year ago , @entity31 's " @entity6 : an @entity36 " got the job done , but it was too bright and busy and noisy , with creatures that kept popping up as if out of a @entity35			2
" the @entity15 " is a more grandly somber movie , and also a much better one , with forces of boldly intense and unified malevolence			1
@entity40 published @entity6 in 1937 , on the eve of @entity42 , and his book is suffused with a sense of evil looming up in the world			0
this time @entity31 nails that tone : the feeling that @entity7 , who 's been recruited to steal back a wondrous gem called the @entity52 from the dragon @entity53 , is up against a cosmic storm of black forces			1
the dragon has ravaged the land , the angry , hulking orcs are on a power trip , and the elves — led by the imperious @entity62 ( @entity63 ) — are isolationists who trap the dwarves in a dungeon , setting up a great escape via wine barrels on white rapids			0
the dwarves , thirsting to return to their homeland ( they could almost be @entity72 ) , are portrayed with a crusty urgency that takes them up dizzying stone peaks and pits them against one another			0
does " the @entity15 " meander ? of course it does — it 's a hobbit movie ! yet @entity31 's direction is spiky and majestic , and the risky move of inventing his own @entity40 character — the elf guard @entity81 ( @entity82 ) — as a love interest for @entity84 ( @entity85 ) pays off			1
these two bring some badly needed heat to the woodlands			0
speaking of heat , the dragon is , quite simply , a marvel : gargantuan yet balletic , hoarding his mountain of gold with a razor - toothed smile , breathing not just flame but an inferno , and voiced by @entity97 with the most delicious , insidious knowledge			0
@entity7 , as played by @entity8 , suggests a sly - dog @entity99 without irony , and he is certainly overmatched , but that does n't mean he 's outplayed			0
@entity103 is now his business			0
