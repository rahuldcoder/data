in " the @entity7 , " the new book causing a stir with its speculation about the extent of the first lady 's political influence , author @entity0 recounts an anecdote : a young schoolgirl tells @entity10 that she hopes to someday become a president 's wife herself one day			1
" does n't pay well , " mrs. @entity10 wittily cracks			1
truth be told , pay is the least of the drawbacks of being a first lady			1
the unelected , unaccountable and unofficial position has been challenging presidential spouses for more than two centuries now			1
i 've spent years researching and interviewing first ladies , but it was @entity23 who best crystallized for me the essential reality of what it means to be first lady : " who i really am as a person is ultimately less important to the public than what they want me to represent as a persona			1
" this was as true for mental health care reform advocate @entity35 in the 1970s as it was for the happy hostess @entity38 a century earlier			0
@entity10 articulated her own frustration with this the other day , for seeming , she said , to have been cast as " some kind of angry black woman			1
" there is truth in mrs. @entity10 's observation ; her historic status as the first @entity48 first lady has made her at times a target for unfair stereotype and very ugly treatment			1
but casting the first lady as " the other " -- that is , outside the concept of the @entity55 as acceptably " @entity48 " -- has a long history			1
almost a century ago , when the press widely reported that @entity59 was from the " @entity61 family , " as the great - great - great - great - great - great - great - granddaughter of princess @entity63 , even serious journalists ignored the fact that it meant only one of her 512 ninth - generation ancestors was a @entity69			0
instead , it prompted members of the public to send her @entity69 items like a beaded belt and write to government officials warning that it was illegal for the first lady to be served alcohol			2
as late as the 1960 election , when the @entity80 of @entity82 presidential candidate @entity81 finally broke through the nation 's historic anti-papist sentiment , the campaign of his opponent , @entity86 , soft - pedaled his wife 's ethnic and religious background			2
not only was @entity89 the daughter of a @entity92 immigrant mother , but also of an @entity94 father			0
@entity81 's campaign may not have been able to conceal that @entity96 was catholic too , but at least her " @entity96 " maiden name offered legitimate exotic cover for the larger reality of her background : she had only one @entity102 paternal great - grandparent , and her " @entity104 " mother was not of the famous blue - blood clan , but rather had briefly lived in the @entity106 for a college term and was as @entity94 as the @entity108			2
@entity109 ? despite her widely distributed @entity112 @entity111 cookie recipe , even she never acknowledged her grandparents as immigrants from @entity112			0
at other points , societal judgments of the first ladies served well as veiled partisan attacks on their husbands			1
in an earlier time , the worldly , abolitionist @entity120 of the wealthy @entity123 @entity122 clan would have been idealized as a southern belle hostess			0
but married to the @entity126 's president during the @entity127 , she was maliciously caricatured as a racist secretly loyal to the @entity128			2
and @entity133 , realizing that disclosure of his wife @entity130 's epilepsy would fix her with a label of " insanity , " avoided the ignorant presumption by asserting that she was an " invalid , " as evidenced by her use of a wheelchair or cane			2
the 1828 campaign editorials shaming @entity141 as morally unfit because her first marriage had ended in divorce were central to the character attacks on her husband , @entity145			0
nearly 100 years later , such judgment was still so strongly feared for its political liability that @entity149 outright lied to the press with her claim of having been widowed by her first husband , not divorced			0
by 1976 , however , @entity154 's first marriage ending in divorce was not an issue , and neither was the earlier divorce of presidential candidate @entity157			0
as time moves on and @entity48 life and demographics evolve , so too will the perceptions of wives in the @entity160			0
however , hurtful remarks or hateful racism aimed at the current first lady may feel to @entity167 of many different backgrounds so shaming as to force a tipping point in history			1
one can hope it will finally help reduce the rhetoric of future generations about presidential spouses based on their origins , appearance -- even gender			0

@entity183 says a new book about the @entity7 points up tough **job** of first lady
he says **job** is societal *minefield* ; @entity10 worries she 's cast as an " angry black woman "
he says first ladies have long endured stereotypes , been used for political jabs at their spouses
@entity183 : hurtful remarks about @entity10 may shame *people* into leaving first ladies alone
