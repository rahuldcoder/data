but we feel like we can go up there and compete			0
" @entity53 , speaking in @entity1 late tuesday , praised his supporters for a " fantastic showing " and claimed that he and the top two were the caucuses ' " three winners , " ready to raise money and compete well in the next contests			2
" we have had a fantastic showing for this cause and challenging people ... and saying , you know , this challenge of , ' let 's go back to this real old - fashioned idea , this very dangerous idea : let 's obey the @entity173 , ' " @entity53 said			1
" ... we will go on , we will raise the money			0
i have no doubt about the supporters			0

the delegate number needed to clinch the nomination is 1,144			0
the @entity1 results typically are important because they give the top finishers the fuel they need , including fundraising , to keep their campaigns going			0

" in some ways , i 'm more optimistic now than i was when i first ran , because we 've already seen change take place , " @entity8 said in the teleconference			0
" and part of what 2012 is about is reminding the @entity35 people how far we 've traveled and the concrete effects that some of our work has had in terms of making sure people have health insurance and making sure our troops are coming home , or making sure people are able to go to college			0
" part of it is also framing this larger debate : what kind of country are we going to leave for our children and grandchildren ? " in addition to @entity89 , some other @entity17 candidates may now consider whether they 're in position to compete in the upcoming contests			2
one issue to watch will be how many of their supporters latch onto the remaining @entity245 candidates , said @entity2 political contributor @entity246 , a former @entity248 press secretary			0
" @entity3 does n't want anybody to drop out , " @entity246 said tuesday , suggesting @entity3 would want to have any @entity250 vote split as many ways as possible			2
