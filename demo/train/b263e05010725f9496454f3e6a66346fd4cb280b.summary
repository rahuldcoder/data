@entity0 -- when something big and exciting happens right in your own backyard , you sort of have to stop , pull up a chair , and enjoy the moment			1
especially when it 's quite literally in your backyard			1
two squirrels fighting over an acorn qualifies as must - see , five - star entertainment			1
my assistant knows the drill			1
" @entity16 fight ! @entity17 , cancel all my appointments			1
" of course , i do n't actually have an assistant named @entity17			2
and i do n't have appointments			2
but if i did , she would clear them for such unexpected awesomeness			2
which , when you have my delightfully low standards , would be often			2
but this weekend , in my figurative backyard of @entity0 , there are some actual , legitimate big - time festivities happening			1
so big , in fact , it 's like three squirrels fighting over an acorn			2
" @entity33 ! @entity17 , bring me nachos			2
" naturally , of course , i 'm talking about the world - famous , four - day - long , sweaty orgy of humanity known as the @entity40 men 's basketball @entity41			1
mind you , that is n't their official description			2
and not only is the @entity41 completely taking over my city , it 's also trending everywhere online in social media			1
thus , i figured , so long as people are talking about it , and so long as it 's in town , i might as well become one with " the madness " and download the official app to learn exactly what 's going on			2
( ahem , disclosure : @entity1 is a part of the @entity62 family , and @entity62 is a major broadcast partner of the @entity64			1
though i am a team player , this week 's topic has nothing to do with my employer			2
i chose it because i 'm lazy and it 's happening next door to my office )			2
sadly , however , the schedule of events does n't suggest anything about fighting squirrels			0
" @entity17 , take the rest of the day off			0
" the @entity41 @entity0 app is actually pretty useful for sorting out all the weekend 's craziness , and i immediately noticed that most of it is happening in a strange place called @entity80			1
i sort of picture a sad little neighborhood where the streets are littered with torn pieces of paper			0
the men are all clinically depressed because their girlfriends ' " favorite mascot " strategy works every year			0
and at the end of march , tradition leads these anguished souls to the top of @entity93 to scream profanities at @entity95			0
in fact , when it 's not serving the @entity41 , @entity80 is actually just the lower level of @entity98 of the @entity99 -- otherwise known as the greatest carpet contract in the history of man			1
seriously , this place is huge , and every time i walk through part of the 3.9 million square feet all i can think is that whoever sold the flooring is living large on a private yacht			1
and it drives me crazy			0
you see , i currently do not own a private yacht			0
which is not to imply that someday i will			0
because i most certainly wo n't			0
so , just what is @entity80 ? in their own words -- presumably drafted to charm and delight the @entity119 -- the @entity40 describes it as " the @entity121 , offering more than 300,000 square feet of family - friendly activities			1
" @entity124 frick frack ! that 's a lot of @entity126 's			0
and it 's also a lot of floor space			0
i took a preview tour on tuesday and needed oxygen			0
consider that a regulation basketball court is 4,700 square feet			1
by doing far more math than the warning label on my discount - bin brain allows , i somehow calculated that @entity80 is roughly the equivalent of 64 full - size courts			1
that 's massive ! having said that , i realize this is a completely useless statistic , and none of us are any smarter for my calculations			1
plus , i now have a headache			0
nevertheless , inside @entity80 , which goes from friday at noon until sometime monday when they run out of @entity148 , ticket holders can experience everything from 3 - on - 3 tournaments to autograph signings to skills challenges in several of the 80 - plus @entity40 sports			1
sadly , napping on the couch does not appear to be one of them			0
so , i do n't predict any personal success in these challenges			0
it seems my greatest skill does not lend itself to scholarship opportunities			0
but for many of the expected 10,000 @entity80 fans who possess far greater athleticism than i , there will be plenty of opportunities to slam - dunk basketballs , kick soccer goals , and crack home runs			1
and for my equals who would rather test the limits of their liver than those of their muscles , there 's even an adult beverage lounge setup by @entity180			0
you know , because @entity182 needs her medicine			0
of course , this is all just one large part of an already action - packed weekend			0
in addition to @entity80 , @entity185 will be hosting free concerts from @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , and more			1
which is great , save for the fact that somehow getting home from downtown will require a catapult			0
and i 'm not sure how i feel about being hooked up to a machine just to bypass traffic			0
so , a bunch of us are just sticking around and taking it all in			1
because this is the @entity41 , and this is my backyard			1
" @entity17 , help me find a port - o - john			0
