the attack is harrowing : @entity3 militants raid a quarry in @entity5 , separating @entity7 workers from their @entity9 counterparts and executing them			1
the brutal act comes just days after the @entity11 ambushed a bus and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite @entity16 verses			0
the attacks reminded the world once again how brazen the group can be			0
what does @entity3 want ? here 's an explainer			2
what is @entity3 , and what does it want ? @entity3 is a @entity24 group that the @entity25 designated as a foreign terrorist organization in march 2008			1
it wants to turn @entity24 into a fundamentalist @entity11 state , according to the @entity28			2
the group has been blamed for attacks in @entity24 that have killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and @entity35 peacekeepers			1
it has a history of striking abroad , too			0
before admitting to the @entity5 quarry attack , @entity3 was responsible for the july 2010 suicide bombings in @entity40 , @entity41 , that killed more than 70 people , including a @entity25 citizen , who had gathered at different locations to watch the broadcast of the world cup final soccer match			1
how big is it ? the total size of @entity3 is not clear			2
in 2011 , a @entity25 official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said @entity3 was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters			1
a @entity54 report identified one insurgent leader who is believed to command " an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters , " most of them @entity5			2
and @entity3 has links to other organizations			0
in february 2012 , the group 's leader , @entity62 , and @entity64 leader @entity63 released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations			2
how did @entity3 start ? decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made @entity24 a target for radical @entity72 groups			1
@entity3 's predecessor was @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , which worked to create an @entity72 emirate in @entity24			1
it was , in part , funded by former @entity64 leader @entity77 , according to the @entity28			0
@entity74 , which the @entity78 designated as a terrorist group , strengthened after the fall in 1991 of @entity82 's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued			1
in 2003 , a rift erupted between @entity86 's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members , who were seeking to establish fundamental @entity11 rule			0
( @entity3 means " the youth			0
" ) that strife led the younger members to ally with a group of @entity95 courts -- the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) -- that were seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city			1
working together , the @entity93 and @entity3 gainied control of @entity101 in 2006			0
that sparked fears in neighboring @entity104 that violence would spill over there , according to the @entity28			0
those fears -- combined with a request from @entity24 's transitional government -- led @entity104 forces to enter @entity24 in december 2006 and to remove the @entity93 from power			2
and that move inflamed @entity3 , which attacked @entity104 forces and gained control of parts of central and southern @entity24 , according to a 2011 case study by @entity115 , who was then with the @entity116 at the @entity117			1
what is @entity3 's relationship with neighboring countries ? in 2011 , after attacks on tourist destinations in northern @entity5 blamed on @entity3 , the @entity5 government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern @entity24			1
@entity104 troops have also crossed the border and expelled @entity3 from @entity128 , a strategic town midway between the @entity104 border and @entity101			0
the group then targeted @entity35 soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks			0
a suicide bombing in march 2012 killed five people at the presidential palace			0
analysts say tension appears to have been growing within @entity3 between @entity24 and foreign fighters , several hundred of whom are thought to have entered @entity24 in recent years to join the group			1
how does @entity3 recruit ? the group has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a @entity147 account and video production abilities			2
@entity3 has even made a video is as slickly produced as a reality tv show , complete with a hip - hop jihad voice and a startling message : " mortar by mortar , shell by shell , only going to stop when i send them to hell , " an unidentified voice raps in @entity154			2
but @entity3 's enemies -- and alliances -- can shift			0
@entity164 , whose real name is @entity166 , said in a video posted online last year that he had had a fallout with @entity3 " regarding matters of the @entity95 and matters of strategy " and feared for his life			1
he was reportedly killed in @entity24 by @entity3			1
@entity0 was not able to confirm the report			0
finding replacements might not be difficult			0
sheikh @entity175 , a member of @entity177 's @entity24 community , said he knows of hundreds of young @entity24 men living in the @entity179 who returned to @entity24 for terrorist training			2
how is @entity3 funded ? the once - ragtag @entity64 affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse , raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion , illegal taxation and other " fees , " according to the 2011 @entity54 report			1
the @entity25 believed then that the group was coordinating with @entity64 groups in @entity192 and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad			1
in 2011 , it was generating " between $ 70 million and $ 100 million per year , from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports , taxes on goods and services , taxes in kind on domestic produce , ' jihad contributions , ' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation , " according to the report from the @entity213 on @entity24 and @entity214			0
how have @entity24 been affected ? in 2011 , the @entity54 declared a famine in the southern @entity24 regions of @entity217 and @entity218 , and @entity3 reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine - stricken areas			1
that year , the @entity223 for @entity224 said @entity24 had the highest mortality rate in the world for children ages 4 and younger			0
about 258,000 @entity24 died in the famine between october 2010 and april 2012 , and half the victims were younger than age 5 , according to a report from the @entity54 @entity231 and the @entity233 - funded @entity232			2
what is the @entity25 doing ? the @entity25 has supported @entity54 - backed @entity236 forces fighting @entity3 and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group			1
it has also donated millions of dollars in aid			0
what is the status of @entity24 's government today ? in september 2012 , @entity24 parliament members selected @entity244 as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation , which had not had a stable central government since @entity82 's overthrow 21 years earlier			1
but that did n't mean @entity3 was calling it quits			0
in january 2013 , @entity254 forces attempted to rescue a @entity254 intelligence commando held hostage in @entity24 by the group			1
the raid left the soldier dead , another soldier missing and 17 @entity72 fighters dead			0
but there has been political progress in @entity24			0
in january 2013 , for the first time in more than two decades , the @entity25 granted official recognition to the @entity24 government			1
@entity0 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 contributed to this report .			0
