-- by far , my greatest interests in life are words and humor			1
i 'm obsessed with both , which is why my favorite comedian is the late @entity8 -- the funny man most obsessed with how we talk			2
nothing has ever floated the boats of my two obsessions more than a good @entity13 or book			0
the publication of " @entity16 " -- a product of 17 years of work that make it the largest slang dictionary ever published in @entity21 -- is a glorious event for anyone who loves words and likes to laugh			1
covering slang from the @entity33 to @entity34 , @entity35 , and beyond , @entity26 records and documents more than 100,000 words and idioms in an @entity31 - like , quotation - packed historical dictionary			1
those terms range from the crude ( " sweat bird turds , " meaning " work hard " ) to the subtle ( " give someone the mitten " -- end a relationship ) and everywhere in between			0
as @entity26 says , slang is " ... vibrant , creative , witty , and open to seemingly infinite re-invention			1
it is voyeuristic , amoral , libertarian , and libertine			0
it is self - indulgent			0
" so is this dictionary			2
folks have struggled to define slang for centuries			2
one of the most accepted definitions is " @entity56 " editor @entity57 's claim -- " the aim and chief function of slang is to lower and disavow the dignity of discourse			2
" good : ' @entity63 : ' a dance performance inspired by riding @entity66 's buses @entity67 -- author of " slang : the @entity70 " -- offers a complementary view : " ... it 's not just that slang lowers dignity , but that dignity is under criticism in slang ... to the extent that everyday speech is boring , slang is meant to elevate discourse , not lower it			1
" as for @entity26 , in the intro to his massive new dictionary , he writes , " i would call slang a ' counter-language , ' the desire of human beings , when faced by a standard version , of whatever that might be , to come up with something different , perhaps parallel , perhaps oppositional			1
" that drive to coin words seems as biologically driven as many of the topics slang usually names			1
as @entity26 notes , " ... the basic concerns remain consistent in slang as they do in much that is human : sex , money , intoxication , fear ( of others ) , aggrandizement ( of oneself )			1
" within any of those topics , the range of vocabulary is astounding			0
one my favorite euphemisms -- " @entity112 discussion " -- is included , as well as many variations on themes , such as " playing			0
" you can " play at " itch - buttocks , all fours , belly - to - belly , blindman 's bluff , bo - peep , fathers and mothers , and handie - dandie			0
good : more college grads are taking nonprofit jobs			0
but is it just a fad ? you can also play " night baseball , " " the first game ever played , " or " mr. @entity128 hides his helmet			0
" the most romantic term might be " bouncing refrigerators			0
" i 'm going to add that to the hobbies list on my dating profile immediately			0
beyond sex , the range of terms and types of terms is enough to make your top - hamper ( head ) spin			0
there are comic book - y sound effects , like " kerplunk , " " kaplunk , " and " ka - plonk			0
" there 's @entity151 rhyming slang , including " @entity152 " ( bike ) , " two eyes of blue " ( too true ) , and " @entity155 " ( sleep )			2
there are indefinite words , such as " thingahoochie " and " thingsmadoodle , " plus exclamations like " @entity162 creeping @entity163 ! " pop culture is well - represented , as " go to the mattresses " is traced to @entity167 's @entity166 in 1969 , and " neo maxi zoom dweebie " was coined in @entity170 in 1985			2
@entity171 appears often , nowhere as blatantly as in " undue perversity " -- a nickname for @entity174			0
speaking of education -- and as a teacher myself -- i love the term " gerund - grinder " : an 18th century insult for a schoolteacher			0
that 's not even the tip of the tip of the slangberg : @entity26 's lexical buffet seems to go on forever			1
of course , even the biggest and best slang dictionary ever ca n't be complete or perfect			1
i think @entity57 's @entity56 ( @entity56 ) is a slightly better word book -- in theory , if not fact			0
sadly , that incredible project has never been finished , and what is published is a tad out of date			2
i was also stunned by some omissions in @entity26 's			1
how can " assmunch " and " meh " miss the cut when so many obscurities are listed ? then again , i 'm sure every @entity21 speaker knows some slang terms that did n't get scooped up			1
good : low - tech project inspires community engagement in @entity203 when looking at such a massive , well - documented collection of words , griping about what 's missing is a tad ungrateful : like dissing @entity208 for not being voluptuous enough			2
it 's a shame @entity8 did n't live to see this amazing work , which is awesome in the " causing awe " and " whoa , dude " senses			0
in addition to his prolific comedy , @entity8 was a bit of a lexicographer himself -- @entity26 cites some of @entity8 's @entity218 several times			1
i bet @entity8 would appreciate @entity26 's spin on slang : " to me its greatest charm is that at its heart , even its most obscene and gutter - dwelling heart , it is subversive			1
this is not political subversion -- slang is above politics -- but a subversion of the @entity21 language itself			1
and by subverting @entity21 , it subverts the givens of the world that @entity21 informs			1
" @entity8 , a lifelong subversive and committed atheist , once speculated that his soul might go to a garage in @entity238			0
i hope someone finds that garage and sends a copy of @entity26 's massive record of our naughty mother tongue there -- stat. he would love it			1

" @entity16 " is the largest slang dictionary ever published in @entity21
@entity26 records and documents more than 100,000 words and idioms
