-- promising trials hinted that circumcision could lower rates of hiv infection , but until now , researchers did n't fully understand why			0
now , in a study published in the journal @entity9 , scientists say that changes in the population of bacteria living on and around the penis may be partly responsible			2
relying on the latest technology that make sequencing the genes of organisms faster and more accessible , @entity17 of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) and his colleagues conducted a detailed genetic analysis of the microbial inhabitants of the penis among a group of @entity25 men who provided samples before circumcision and again a year later			0
@entity0 : if circumcision rates keep falling , health costs and infections will spike while the men showed similar communities of microbes before the operation , 12 months later , the circumcised men harbored dramatically fewer bacteria that survive in low oxygen conditions			1
they also had 81 % less bacteria overall compared to the uncircumcised men , and that could have a dramatic effect on the men 's ability to fight off infections like @entity4 , says @entity17			1
previous studies showed that circumcised men lowered their risk of transmitting @entity4 by as much as 50 % , making the operation an important tool in preventing infection with the virus			1
why ? a high burden of bacteria could disrupt the ability of specialized immune cells known as @entity59 cells to activate immune defenses			1
normally , @entity61 are responsible for grabbing invading microbes like bacteria or viruses and presenting them to immune cells for training , to prime the body to recognize and react against the pathogens			1
but when the bacterial load increases , as it does in the uncircumcised penile environment , inflammatory reactions increase and these cells actually start to infect healthy cells with the offending microbe rather than merely present them			0
@entity0 : can new circumcision devices help fight @entity77 in @entity78 ? that may be why uncircumcised men are more likely to transmit @entity4 than men without the foreskin , says @entity17 , since the @entity59 cells could be feeding @entity4 directly to healthy cells			1
his group is also investigating how changes in the levels of cytokines , which are the signaling molecules that immune cells use to communicate with each other , might be influenced by bacterial populations			2
" there is a real revolution going on in our understanding of the microbiome , " says @entity17 , who is also professor of occupational and environmental health at @entity91			0
" the microbiome is almost like another organ system , and we are just scratching the surface of understanding the interplay between the microbiome and the immune system			0
" previous work suggested that changes in the bacterial populations in the gut , for example , could affect obesity , and other studies found potential connections between microbial communities and the risk for cancer , asthma and other chronic conditions			0
@entity0 : study identifies four new genetic markers for severe childhood obesity this study was originally published on @entity0			0

the decreased risk may be *due* to changes in bacteria on and around the penis
a high burden of bacteria may disrupt specialized immune cells
uncircumcised men are more likely to transmit @entity4 than circumcised men
