-- @entity1 was just shy of 30 years old when he piloted a @entity2 , the military designation of the venerable commercial @entity4 , from @entity5 to @entity6 , @entity7			1
the @entity2 was the 100th to be delivered to the @entity8 , or @entity8			1
the @entity10 had been at war since december 7 , 1941			1
@entity8 had been at war long before that			1
the @entity14 invaded @entity15 in 1937			0
like airlines all over the globe would do as @entity19 unfolded , @entity8 , based in @entity16 , shifted its operations to military service as the @entity14 closed in on @entity22 and southern @entity15			1
young pilot ' too old ' for service for a young goutiere , of @entity26 , @entity27 , the delivery flight of this @entity2 , @entity29 4193 , would be his own entry into the war zone			1
he 'd been rejected by the @entity31 when he volunteered after the @entity14 bombed @entity32 ; he was too old , having missed the 26 - and - a - half age cutoff			0
rebuffed , he joined @entity34 , a subsidiary of the storied airline set up to ferry all types of airplanes to the @entity10 armed forces and allies			2
@entity1 ferried planes from the @entity10 to @entity41 after joining @entity42 , but @entity43 would take him to @entity7 , the jumping - off point to combat areas			1
the ferry flight of @entity43 -- a short - range , twin - engine aircraft , designed to seat 21 passengers -- took 90 flight hours over 14 days			2
@entity1 flew via @entity51 , @entity52 in the mid-atlantic , through @entity41 and on to @entity7			2
in december 1942 , @entity1 began flying for @entity8 from @entity7 over the @entity54 to @entity15 , a dangerous routing call " the @entity56 , " ferrying supplies for @entity15 and @entity10 troops and the @entity31 , for the rest of the war			1
a round trip took about seven hours			0
" there were three enemies , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" mountains , @entity14 and the weather			0
weather is what did the most damage			0
" @entity1 flew ship 100 on some of his 680 missions through september 1945 , when @entity14 surrendered			2
flying through history the last time @entity1 saw @entity43 was in 1945 -- until 69 years later , when on september 4 he arrived in @entity72 , @entity73 , at the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) in the shadow of @entity77 's giant wide - body plant at @entity78			1
@entity74 acquired @entity43 100 in 2006 and was preparing to fly the airplane to the annual @entity80 in @entity81			1
after doing a walk - around inspection of the plane , @entity1 , family members and a small entourage piled into the historic aircraft for the flight to @entity81 , which took just less than five hours			1
the flight underscored advances in aviation technology			0
a flight leaving the @entity94 area in a modern jetliner , for instance , would travel well past @entity96 in five hours			1
the flight started off at 2,500 feet outside of @entity72 and over the @entity98 in @entity99 before hitting turbulence			1
cruising at about 160 knots ( roughly 185 mph ) with no auto - pilot and using only visual flight rules , passengers felt their ears popping due to no pressurization in the cabin			2
after diverting around wildfires in the @entity110 area of northern @entity111 , the aircraft climbed to 13,800 feet to avoid restricted air space reserved for aerial tankers			2
@entity10 , @entity15 @entity19 pilots embrace at historic reunion upon arrival at @entity118 , the plane was met by legendary @entity8 c - 47 pilot @entity119 , who set a record during the war for evacuating 71 people fleeing the @entity14			1
one of the 71 was a @entity31 colonel named @entity124 , who was making his way back to @entity127 lines after @entity51 's first offensive mission against @entity14 following the attack on @entity32 -- the famous air raid on @entity131 in april 1942			0
@entity119 and @entity1 embraced and exchanged smiles and warm words in advance of celebrating the @entity8 with scores of relatives of @entity8 employees and families and others on hand to honor the men and women who took part in this theater of @entity19 @entity1 and @entity119 are the sole remaining pilots who flew for the @entity8 during @entity19 @entity1 , who still resides in @entity146 , will be 100 this month			1
@entity119 , now 102 , lives in @entity147 , @entity111			1
extreme hazards while flying during the war , c - 47s were unarmed			0
@entity1 carried only a .45 caliber pistol			2
he never was shot at and only iced up once , with four tons , forcing him from 18,000 feet to 12,000 feet			0
the dependable @entity2 carried him to safety			2
the flying was n't a cakewalk , however , and the @entity56 is littered with wreckage of airplanes that were brought down by weather or flying into the mountains			0
ironically , good weather was n't a good omen , either			0
" a clear day was dangerous , " @entity1 recalled			2
" @entity14 zeros would come out , so we began flying at night			0
we did 15 to 18 trips a month			0
as we began to understand the weather , @entity8 lost one aircraft a month " the planes had to thread their way through dangerous mountain passes			1
they were usually overloaded with supplies or fuel			0
goutiere , along with his fellow pilots , delivered gasoline to @entity10 @entity177 air bases , staging areas for bombing raids over @entity14			2
sometimes , under the demands of war , pilots took to the skies alone , @entity1 among them			2
the conga line of airplanes worked hand - in - hand with the @entity188 ( @entity188 ) , more commonly known as the @entity189			0
@entity8 was a principal source of fuel for the @entity189			2
turbulent history for @entity2 when the war ended , ship 100 was converted to passenger configuration and entered @entity8 's peacetime service			1
but the civil war between the @entity198 under @entity199 and the @entity200 under @entity201 , which began before @entity19 and only moderated during the fight against the @entity14 , resumed			0
@entity8 helped evacuate @entity199 's family to @entity204 ( then called @entity204 ) when it became clear @entity201 and the @entity200 would soon claim victory			1
@entity8 's fleet evacuated from @entity15 to @entity16 during the closing days of the civil war			1
lawsuits were filed over ownership and the fleet was tied up in courts for two years			0
a few airplanes remained airworthy during the limbo , including @entity43			0
saboteurs placed small bombs on these to prevent them from being flown into @entity15			0
some failed to go off -- but one on @entity43 did , damaging the fairing behind the right engine			0
legal ownership was eventually resolved and @entity43 was sold to @entity220 , the @entity10 consumer goods company			0
the airplane was modified , adding landing gear doors to streamline aerodynamics and an elongated nose to accommodate radar			0
@entity74 locates plane by 2006 , the aircraft had changed hands several more times and was owned by an aircraft broker in @entity27			1
@entity231 , founder of the @entity74 , was looking for a @entity4 to add to the @entity74 collection of airworthy aircraft			1
@entity74 focuses on the 1937 - 1957 era of significant military and civil advances in aviation			0
sessions wanted aircraft that were n't only from this era , but aircraft with a history			0
ship 100 filled the bill			0
sessions had the gear doors removed and replaced the " @entity248 " nose with a standard @entity4 nose fabricated from scratch			0
the airliner was painted in @entity42 colors ( his late wife worked for @entity42 ) ; @entity42 owned 45 % of @entity8 until after @entity19			1
@entity74 takes the @entity4 to air shows and offers rides			0
but the @entity8 reunion became a special occasion , and ship 100 's flight from @entity72 to @entity81 became its longest in years at just less than five hours			1
for @entity1 , the reunion with @entity43 was as important as the @entity80 in @entity81			1
" i was home , " an emotional @entity1 told the reunion			1
" you can fly on a combat - scarred @entity266 icon who is @entity268			0
@entity269 and why was his @entity270 for sale ? @entity272 is an aviation author and consultant based in the @entity94 area .			1
