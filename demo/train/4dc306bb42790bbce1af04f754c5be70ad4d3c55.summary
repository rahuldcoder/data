-- former @entity2 head football coach @entity1 believes he is being scapegoated by his former university as it deals with the largest academic fraud scandal in the history of college sports			1
@entity1 , in an interview with @entity0 on tuesday , said , " i can tell you with every fiber in me that i did not know about cheating			1
" his statements come after a caller identifying himself as @entity12 , one of @entity1 ' former players , told @entity15 radio station wjmh that " everyone " in the athletic department knew about so - called paper classes , and that @entity1 even told his players , " if you all came here for an education , you should have gone to @entity21			1
" @entity12 played from 2008 to 2011 , under @entity1 until 2010			1
whether he was the person speaking to the radio station monday could not be confirmed by @entity0 , and efforts by @entity0 to reach @entity12 were not successful			0
@entity1 , who was fired from @entity2 as the scandal began to unfold in early 2011 , told @entity0 he read about what @entity12 purportedly said on the radio , but @entity1 said his own words were taken out of context			1
@entity1 , now an analyst with @entity32 , said he made the @entity21 remark to his players , but portrayed his remarks as being " halfway joking , teasing , and half tongue - in - cheek			1
" he admitted the comment was a poor choice of words , " but it was never intended to be anything other than , ' life is tough for student athletes , ' " adding that he told the players something similar to , " guys , i know how hard your day is ... your life is tougher than non-student - athletes			0
if you just wanted an education , solely , you should have gone to @entity21			0
" former athlete sues unc over academic scandal last month , former federal prosecutor @entity52 released a scathing report , the product of an eight - month investigation into fake classes at @entity2 , and found that about 30 administrators at the university knew that athletes who were failing or were at risk of failing were shuffled into classes where a single paper was required and where plagiarism was overlooked			1
@entity64 portrayed rampant and systematic cheating , spanning 18 years and affecting 3,100 students			0
his report came five years after the scandal was first uncovered , and follows several other internal investigations			0
but it was by far the most comprehensive to date , for the first time implicating staff in the scheme			0
@entity1 said he feels his interview with @entity52 was mischaracterized in the summary			1
" i do feel like there have been things that it looked like it would be the easy way -- blame it on the football program and maybe it will all go away , " @entity1 said			1
@entity52 's report found that when an athlete was on the brink of eligibility , advisers in football and basketball and other sports would often enroll the athlete in a paper class , sometimes suggesting the grade they needed to stay afloat academically			2
this , in part , was done because many athletes at @entity2 were admitted to the university even though they were unprepared			1
@entity52 's report says that @entity1 admitted to knowing about easy classes in the @entity101 ( @entity102 ) studies department , and knew that these classes were keeping athletes eligible			1
it cites a 2009 @entity107 presentation in which @entity1 was told that many of his players were in these classes and that they " did n't go to class ... did n't take notes ... did n't have to meet with professors ... [ and ] did n't have to pay attention or necessarily engage with the material			1
" but @entity1 said that episode , too , was mischaracterized			2
@entity1 said he was under the impression the situations being discussed had only happened in the past , and he insisted that coaches were not involved in the academics of student - athletes			2
" the coaches and athletic department has no control over degrees they choose , the course -- that had nothing to do with me , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" every year they would say , ' when do you want to have practice , and we 'll work around it			0
' i may have told @entity132 that those classes helped kids stay eligible , but i did n't know it was crooked until after i left the program			2
" @entity1 said he believed that the independent studies in the @entity102 department were the same as independent studies courses in any other college in the school			2
@entity1 said -- and this is backed up by @entity52 's report -- that he had no idea that plagiarism was accepted , or that the papers were n't graded by the professor , @entity147 , but by his clerical assistant @entity148			1
" how would i , as a football coach , know that a secretary is grading the papers ? " @entity1 said			1
@entity52 acknowledged that both @entity1 and basketball coach @entity152 took steps to improve the academics of their athletes while coaching at @entity2			1
@entity1 reduced the number of athletes admitted who were underprepared			2
and @entity152 took steps to reduce clustering , @entity52 said			0
report finds 18 years of academic fraud at @entity2 according to @entity52 's report , the paper classes , which began in 1993 , were @entity148 's idea			1
@entity52 reviewed transcripts and found that they were most prevalent between 1999 and 2009			0
@entity1 and @entity152 both coached during those years , and @entity152 won two national championships in basketball during that time			2
@entity147 , who resigned after the scandal emerged , was charged with fraud in connection with the case , but the charge was dropped after he agreed to cooperate with the criminal investigation			0
no charges were filed against @entity148 , who retired in 2009			0
neither @entity148 nor @entity147 has spoken publicly about the scandal , and both declined requests to speak to @entity0			0
@entity1 said he does n't get enough credit for raising his players ' grade - point averages and graduation rates during that time period , although critics say paper classes were part of the reason those @entity189 rose			1
one adviser even characterized them in the @entity132 report as " gpa boosters			0
" but @entity1 said @entity52 's team also neglected to interview some of his assistants who would have backed up his story			2
" these are things that are disturbing , " he said			0
the @entity132 report says all assistant coaches were given the opportunity to talk , but some did not respond			0
@entity1 said he feels the attention should be focused now on the advisers who steered athletes to the sham classes , not on the coaches			1
" all academics at @entity2 fell outside the realm of the athletic department , which is one of the things that i liked , " he said			2
" all of the tutoring ... was handled at the ( university 's ) @entity212			0
this should be about the @entity212 , and leave the coaches out of it because we did n't have anything to do with it			0
" the university issued a statement in response to @entity0 's request for comment : " we appreciate @entity1 ' cooperation with the independent investigation conducted by @entity52			0
mr. @entity1 was one of 126 individuals interviewed about their knowledge of or role in the irregular classes			1
we believe that this was the most thorough and complete investigation possible			0
mr. @entity1 is entitled to his opinions about the final content of mr. @entity52 's report			0
" @entity52 's report found that @entity1 ' predecessor , head coach @entity234 , admitted to some knowledge of the paper class scheme			1
but the report cleared @entity152 , the current basketball coach			0
former interim head football coach @entity239 refused to cooperate with the @entity132 investigation , as did football director @entity241			1
@entity239 is now at @entity242 , and @entity241 is at @entity243 .			0

@entity1 was fired as head football coach at @entity2 as academic scandal unfolded
@entity1 : " i can tell you with ever fiber in me that i did not know about cheating "
@entity1 said he does n't get enough credit for raising his players ' gpas , graduation rates
critics say " paper classes " were part of the reason those @entity189 rose
