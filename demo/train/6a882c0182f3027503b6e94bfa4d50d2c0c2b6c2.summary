-- think of the @entity2 souk -- the fabled marketplaces of the @entity4 -- and it immediately conjures up images straight from the @entity7 : mountains of yellow turmeric , shafts of light through lattices and the air thick with incense smoke			0
these powerful associations have not been lost on the team from the @entity17 that last month won the bid to host the @entity19 ; exhibitors making the journey to @entity22 in seven years will be setting up their pavilions in the biggest souk in history			1
the 438 - hectare site at the @entity27 , @entity28 , will be one of the largest ever developed for a @entity19			1
created in an empty desert area between @entity22 and @entity37 , the vast zones of the structure -- each one representing the bid themes of sustainability , mobility and opportunity - are inspired by the labyrinthine galleries of the souk			1
at the core of the site will be an open plaza called @entity42 -- @entity43 for " the connection " -- to fit with the expo theme of " @entity46 , creating the @entity47			1
" certainly in terms of @entity19 history , @entity22 has a tough act to follow			1
previous @entity51 have famously given the world the @entity53 and unveiled products as important as the telephone and as ubiquitous as @entity56 for @entity57 , co-author of " aerotropolis : the way we 'll live next " , the expo proximity to the new @entity62 and @entity64 development is especially significant			1
" ( @entity64 ) is the best organic example of an ' aerotropolis , ' " says @entity65 , whose book puts the case that modern globalized cities such as @entity22 are built around , and feed off , airports in much the same way as cities in the 19th century were built around the railways			1
" in 1990 , there was nothing really there ... it was the strategy of @entity17 and the civil aviation authority to make @entity22 the crossroads of the world			1
" i do think winning the @entity19 will be a huge catalyst for its development , " he said			0
hub for a new @entity86 what can be said of @entity64 also holds for much of @entity22 too			1
a generation ago , it was just a modest regional entrepot			0
today its strategic position between @entity4 and @entity93 has made it one of the world 's key hubs in the globalized economy			0
according to @entity102 , a global geo - economics specialist and senior advisor at @entity105 , @entity101 businesses use @entity22 as a hub for @entity107 , @entity99 traders use the city to access markets across the world and @entity112 multinationals see @entity22 as a hub for the @entity4			2
" @entity22 sits at the intersection of one of the most transformative moments in geo - economic history in more than a century : the gradual but inexorable shift of the economic center of gravity from the @entity93 to emerging markets and the rise of the so - called " @entity123 " trade , " @entity102 said			2
" i would argue that @entity22 and the @entity17 stand at the center of ' @entity125 ' of trade between the @entity4 and @entity127 , and also what @entity128 calls ' the @entity86 ' linking @entity130 , @entity107 , and @entity127 in a new world of trade			2
" read more : @entity4 's big aviation ambitions by the year 2020 , economists estimate emerging markets will account for roughly half of global gdp , a dramatic leap from just 15 % in the 1980s			0
in terms of air traffic alone , @entity22 's importance as a hub can not be underestimated			2
just four hours ' flight from key cities in both @entity146 and @entity127 , there are now more flights from @entity99 to @entity22 than anywhere else in the world and , in the other directions , more than 300 flights weekly from @entity22 to @entity99			2
inflating property bubbles ? despite its position at the center of a region undergoing massive change , the successful @entity19 bid has raised concerns that @entity22 may become a victim of its own success			1
regional instability combined with rapid development has led to one of the world 's most volatile property markets			2
already a magnet for the super-rich , real estate prices are now underpinned by @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 investors sitting out political troubles at home			0
according to property analysts , prices have already surged 20 % since last year and rents in some neighborhoods are up by 40 %			2

with memories still fresh of the bust in 2008 when property prices were slashed by 50 % and @entity22 had to be bailed out by @entity37 to the tune of us $ 10 billion , some fear that another massive correction is on the way			1
@entity191 , director of @entity192 real estate investors , told the @entity194 conference in @entity22 recently that the city should brace for another fall			0
" the ( investment ) capital is temporary and can quickly move out , " @entity191 warned			0
" and that 's not to say it will fall necessarily as it did before			0
but it will fall , it will correct and this is something we should all expect to happen and i expect it to happen in the next 18 to 24 months ... as capital becomes more expensive globally			0
" despite the dire warning , many believe the @entity19 -- far from creating a bubble - will underpin property prices for many years to come in a city that recovered from the crisis in 2008 faster than anyone expected			1
for @entity102 , @entity22 's real economic resource lies in its people and its position at the crossroads of the world			0
" @entity22 might be one of the most hyper - connected places on the planet , " he said			0
" you can see it on the streets and in the malls			0
there are not many places where you can mingle with more than 200 different nationalities			0
