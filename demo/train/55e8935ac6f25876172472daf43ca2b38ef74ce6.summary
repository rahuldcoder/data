-- on a recent afternoon in @entity3 , @entity2 's @entity1 was checking out rehearsals for @entity5 -- a 25 - date tribute tour with a lineup hand - selected by him and his bandmate , guitarist @entity8 -- when singer @entity9 belted out a few notes from " @entity11 , " stopping the 62 - year - old drummer in his tracks			1
" it was as if @entity17 ( @entity17 ) was in the room , " @entity1 said today during a conference call with journalists			1
" @entity9 is just one of three singers selected to join the @entity22 lineup after a lengthy online audition process			1
the nine lucky musicians will kick off their trek on may 26 in @entity26 after making their live debut last week on " @entity28 " , where they were joined by @entity1 and may			1
" we had such a fantastic response , " said @entity1			1
" we were n't just looking for copies of us			2
we were looking for great musicianship , great charisma and the right people , the right sort of personalities that fit into the band			2
what we were n't looking for were lookalikes			2
" @entity9 first discovered @entity2 's music while watching the 1992 film " @entity40			2
" the 36 - year - old singer , who is also in the @entity43 - based band @entity42 , was later encouraged by his bassist to study @entity17 's singing			2
" i realized , ' wow , this guy did so many amazing things with his voice , ' especially in the studio , " @entity9 explained			2
" he really pushed himself			0
" the tribute tour is just one of the projects that @entity2 have planned for 2012			1
@entity1 and may will also play five @entity2 shows in @entity53 later this year with singer @entity54 on lead vocals			1
according to @entity1 , @entity2 will perform in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
he described the @entity57 show as a " very big outdoor " co-headlining gig with @entity61 ; the @entity58 gigs will take place at the @entity64			0
" we were hoping to do a festival in @entity58 , but for various reasons that did n't happen , " @entity1 said			1
@entity54 , who performed with @entity1 and may on the 2009 " @entity28 " finale , has long been on the duo 's radar			1
" @entity8 and i have seen quite a lot of his shows , " @entity1 added			1
any plans to perform with @entity54 beyond that are unclear for @entity2 , who have toured on a handful of occasions over the past decade with @entity78 singer @entity77			1
" i do n't know whether that 's going to be ongoing , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity8 and i are not the young men we once were			1
these are slightly experimental -- we 've got to see how they go , see how we get on , if it really works			0
who knows what might happen			0
it really is slightly experimental right now			0
we did n't really want to commit ourselves to too many things			0
" @entity89 , @entity1 said , was conceived as a way to present @entity2 's music as the band originally intended			1
complex tunes like " @entity11 " will finally be performed in their entirety			0
" we will be able to do what we could n't do before -- all the harmonies , all the little parts we put onto the record , " said @entity1			1
" this will give us the tools to do that			0
" in typical @entity2 fashion , the @entity22 will also be quite the visual spectacle : @entity1 and may have hired designer @entity104 , who worked on @entity107 's @entity106 concerts and every @entity108 show since 1989 , to work on the tour			1
" i do n't want our music to be represented in any average kind of way , " @entity1 said			1
" we look to excel with this and really teach other bands how to really do a show properly			0
" while @entity9 's vocal resemblance to @entity17 is striking , @entity1 noted that there 's no replacing @entity2 's iconic singer , who died in 1991			1
and @entity1 firmly dismissed the notion that he would ever perform with a " hologram " of @entity17 , the way that dr. @entity122 did with one of @entity124 at @entity125			1
" i do n't want to sit up here with a hologram of my dear friend , " said @entity1			2
" were somebody to use a hologram of @entity17 , i do n't think i would have an objection			0
but i do n't want to			0
it just did n't sit too well with me			0
" when @entity17 died , we were in shock , " continued @entity1			2
" and it did n't go away for five years			0
we would have probably remained together			0
we were very tight and very close			0
we never saw the need to break up			0
i think he 'd love ( these shows )			2
i think he would have been really flattered			0
he would have loved the idea of keeping our musical flag flying			0
@entity8 and i always sort of imagine he 's in the room			2
