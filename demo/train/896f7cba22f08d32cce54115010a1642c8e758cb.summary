" when you smoke indoors , it hurts everybody , " the 59 - year - old says , leaning against an iron fence outside his building			2

" @entity17 would prefer to avoid making himself sick too , of course			0

federal housing officials are trying to help people like @entity17 -- and his neighbors -- by making public housing smoke - free			1

15 ways smoking ruins your looks in a 2009 memo , the department highlighted the dangers that indoor smoking poses to the nation 's 2.1 million public housing residents , and " strongly encouraged " local housing authorities to implement smoking restrictions			1

public health experts are hoping to light a fire under the cause			0
in a paper published today in the @entity63 , a team of researchers and attorneys from @entity61 argue that the health and safety gains of a smoking ban in housing projects would far outweigh the losses , which some say would include the privacy rights of smokers			1
yet smokers like @entity17 could prove to be the biggest winners , the authors suggest			2
" if federal officials and public housing authorities take this cue , we can expect to have large numbers of people quit smoking , " says the lead author of the article , @entity76 , @entity77 , a pediatrician and assistant professor at @entity79 , in @entity80			1

" although the exact numbers of smokers in housing projects are unknown , about 30 percent of @entity91 living below the poverty line smoke tobacco , more than 1.5 times the rate of those who live above it			1
70 years of menthol cigarette ads the idea that the government can tell people what to do in their own homes is controversial , however			0
as @entity76 and his colleagues acknowledge , the smoking restrictions they support are " morally offensive to some " because the restrictions would be imposed on residents who are poor and unable to easily relocate if they disagree with them			2
indeed , not all residents of public housing support the idea			2
" i do want to quit , but at the end of the day , we should n't care what others do , " says @entity110 , 29 , who lives and smokes in @entity17 's housing project			1

" it may be public housing , but people still pay rent and bills and buy their own cigarettes , " she says			2
" they have the right to smoke in their own home			2
" but @entity34 officials and the @entity61 researchers argue that smokers such as @entity110 are , in fact , bothering their neighbors and harming the health of those around them			1
secondhand smoke and third - hand smoke -- the toxic residue left behind on walls , carpets , and clothes long after a cigarette is extinguished -- are bad news , especially for children , pregnant women , people with chronic illnesses , and the elderly , @entity76 and his colleagues note			2

" smoke does n't know to stop at a doorway			0
it travels through air vents and cracks in walls , along ventilation and elevator shafts , and up stairways			0
" smoking bans might also reduce the number of smokers and prevent young people from starting in the first place , says @entity179 , @entity180 , a professor of health policy and management at the @entity183 , and one of @entity76 's co-authors			1
" if we can remove the constant exposure to this behavior as well as to the smoke itself , we also stand a better chance of keeping at - risk youth from beginning to smoke , " @entity179 says			0
10 crazy ways smokers finally kicked the habit even proponents acknowledge that smoking restrictions could prove difficult to enforce , however			1
@entity179 believes that smoking could be regulated in public housing in the same way that drugs and alcohol are , but she and her co-authors note that penalties -- including eviction - may be hard to impose			1
