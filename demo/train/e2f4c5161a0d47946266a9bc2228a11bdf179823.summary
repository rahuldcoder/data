-- @entity2 journalists are finding reporting increasingly difficult in the face of the growing abuse toward them by @entity2 security forces in the @entity7 and @entity8 , according to a report released wednesday by @entity10			1
the report , " no news is @entity12 : @entity20 , " criticizes @entity14 forces in the @entity7 and @entity15 security forces in @entity8 , saying they are abusing local journalists and limiting press freedom in the @entity2 territories			1
the 35 - page report focuses on seven incidents in the @entity7 and two in @entity8 , saying they are " cases in which security forces tortured , beat , and arbitrarily detained journalists , confiscated their equipment and barred them from leaving the @entity7 and @entity8			1
" @entity10 cites a report issued by the @entity29 that says there was a 45 % increase in the number of physical attacks , arrests , confiscation of equipment and limitation of movement in the year 2010			2
" we respect the @entity10 report and other human rights organizations in what they do on the ground , and we have the readiness to investigate each case , " said maj. gen. @entity39 , spokesman for the @entity14 security services			1
but , he said , " why do n't they consult us and ask us ... before publishing these reports ? " he said the security services will investigate and " bring people to justice			2
the @entity14 has no agenda to violate the rights of human beings and especially the rights of the journalists			0
we trust our justice system and the freedom of journalists is a priority of all things			0
" most of the abuses against journalists are connected to the rift between @entity67 , which controls the @entity7 's @entity14 , and @entity15 , which controls @entity8 , according to the report			1
@entity70 journalists are targeted by the @entity2 security forces in the @entity7 and @entity73 journalists are targeted by the @entity15 security in @entity8			1
the report stresses that the @entity7 security forces have " virtual impunity for serious human rights violations " and states that the " utter failure of the ( @entity14 ) leadership to address the prevailing culture of impunity for such abuses suggests that they reflect government policy			1
" " we do n't accept the comparison between us and the militia in @entity8 , " @entity39 said			0
he said his organization has no political agenda and " we do n't hold and detain people on their background			0
we detain people if they have criminal or security threats or matters that threaten the internal security			0
" large sums are donated to the @entity14 security forces in the @entity7 by the @entity100 and the @entity101			1
@entity10 calls on the donor countries to condition their support to those security services by making sure that @entity14 officials investigate and punish security personnel for their abuses			2
attacks on international journalists in @entity8 also have increased in the past couple of months			2
in march 2011 , as journalists were covering a demonstration in @entity8 calling for reconciliation between @entity67 and @entity15 , the offices of @entity113 , @entity0 and @entity114 were raided by @entity15 security forces			1
efforts to get a response from @entity15 officials were not immediately successful			0
the @entity123 - based @entity122 released a statement expressing its " grave concern " that @entity15 security forces " brutally attacked photographers and cameramen , beating them , breaking equipment and confiscating photos and video footage			2
" the organization called the developments the latest in a " string of chilling attacks on reporters in @entity8			0
" the @entity100 and @entity101 have designated @entity15 as a terrorist organization			0
@entity10 describes itself on its website as " one of the world 's leading independent organizations dedicated to defending and protecting human rights			0
" @entity0 's @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
