-- they call it " stinky thursday			2
" in @entity4 , " @entity3			0
" it 's a lot more appetizing than it sounds			2
@entity8 describes the mouthwatering aroma of lamb and pork , seasoned with rosemary , as it 's grilled or slowly spit - roasted			2
every february this smell fills the air in @entity15 , @entity16			1
it 's a signal that @entity18 , the liveliest , most colorful event of the year on the island , is around the corner			1
@entity15 's big festival -- running this year from february 20 to march 2 -- has to be spectacular to stand out			1

@entity36 now lives in @entity42 , the @entity16 capital ( " @entity42 " is often used in @entity43 ) but returns to his native city every year for @entity18 , along with a group of friends			1
@entity4 @entity16 like to claim @entity18 comes from their @entity48 heritage			1
some say it goes all the way back to @entity53 times , to the ancient @entity4 festival dedicated to @entity55 , god of wine and merrymaking			1
in its present incarnation it 's a legacy of the @entity61 who ruled the island in the 15th and 16th centuries , with a special @entity16 spin			1
big blast before @entity67 like @entity18 in @entity69 , @entity16 's version is part of a long @entity72 tradition of enjoying a final blast of self indulgence before the austerity and fasting of the @entity67 period			1
it begins 10 days before @entity67 , at the beginning of @entity80 or " meat week " -- the last chance for devout @entity83 @entity16 to tuck into a tasty platter of grilled souvla , or even a humble kebab , until @entity87			1
everybody gets in on the act , with the city 's brass band and groups of drummers and mandolin - toting kantadoroi " serenaders " accompanying the @entity94 ( or @entity95 )			0
that monarch 's entrance parade opens the festivities on @entity100 thursday			0
more musicians and dancers fill @entity15 's streets and squares throughout the event			1
" i 've been going to the @entity18 for the past three years , " says @entity15 resident @entity106 , who runs the @entity108 website			2
" it 's smaller [ than a carnival like @entity111 ] , but for me that 's part of the charm -- it 's accessible , friendly , and everyone can join in , " @entity106 says			1
" and you do n't have to book a room or tickets years in advance -- most of the events that the municipality puts on are free			0
" grueling parade dressing up for the parades can be grueling , though , @entity106 says			0
" those costumes can get very hot , and the @entity125 lasts for seven or eight hours			0
" traditionally , the parades have an element of satire , with carnival floats and costumed marchers making a colorful comment on current affairs			2
@entity133 , @entity135 's carnival organizer , says that since the event 's rebirth 120 years ago it 's turned into " possibly the only carnival parade in the world that focuses on satirizing the current economic , social and political issues of the country			1
" the carnival " monarch " in 2013 was the " queen of crisis ... and bliss " -- a reminder to keep smiling even during difficult times			2
a vast papier - @entity149 © effigy of @entity151 chancellor @entity150 -- blamed by many @entity16 for the country 's economic troubles -- had a float all to herself			1
balladeers , too , sing comic songs that take the mickey out of politicians and world figures			0

each group chooses a different costume each year			0
some are bought off the peg , others are lovingly hand made			0
clowns , cowboys , pirates , dragons , ancient @entity48 and medieval knights are popular themes , and you can expect to see bands of film and pop stars along with characters from the year 's hit movies and musicals			1
@entity227 , @entity228 last year 's parade featured the surreal sight of hordes of @entity232 and @entity228 lookalikes marching alongside @entity227 - style construction workers and characters from " @entity235 " and the " @entity237 " films			2
most people watching the parade will be dressed up too , or at least masked , so even as a spectator , you 'll feel undressed in everyday wear			0
at @entity244 ( @entity243 24 , parodos @entity245 , @entity15 3012 ) , you can get fitted out as an 18th century duke or duchess , a traditional @entity16 dancer , a cowboy or a 1920s flapper			2
