@entity0 -- @entity3 and other intelligence agencies recently broke up a plot to bomb an airliner and have seized an explosive device that is similar to ones previously used by @entity9 , officials said monday			1
the plot was discovered before it threatened any @entity3 , and no airliners were at risk , one @entity3 counterterrorism official said			1
a nonmetallic explosive device like the one used in the failed attempt to bomb a @entity17 - bound jet in 2009 was recovered , the official said , adding that it was meant for use by a suicide bomber			1
a spokesman for the @entity22 said authorities have " no specific , credible information regarding an active terrorist plot against the @entity3 at this time , " although they continue to monitor efforts to carry out such attacks			2
president @entity29 was told about the plot in april , and the attempt " underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad , " the @entity28 said			2
the threat was foiled around the same time as the anniversary of the raid that killed @entity37 , although a second @entity3 counterterrorism official said the attempted attack was not timed to coincide with the death of the @entity9 leader			1
" what this incident makes clear is that this country has to continue to remain vigilant against those that would seek to attack this country			0
and we will do everything necessary to keep @entity3 safe , " defense secretary @entity48 soon after news of the plot broke			2
the @entity53 said it is conducting technical and forensic analysis on the improvised explosive device that was seized abroad			1
the device is similar to others previously used by @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , which @entity60 officials describe as @entity9 's most dangerous affiliate , the @entity53 said			1
the device was meant to be put on a @entity3 - bound airline , @entity3 rep. @entity62 , chairman of the @entity63 , told @entity1 's @entity66			1
the @entity68 @entity67 said discovery of the bomb plot is just one part of an ongoing operation			0
" it 's not over as far as the operation itself , which is why you 're seeing very few details being given out , " he said			0
both @entity62 and a senior administration official said the intended user of the bomb is no longer a threat			1
the recovered device , which never made it near an airport or airplane , was not built to be a so - called body bomb , the official said			1
" @entity58 is the responsible group here , " said a different senior @entity3 official			1
" while similar , a preliminary review of this device shows that it has some significant differences from the device used in the @entity94 attack			0
it is clear that @entity58 is revamping its bomb techniques to try to avoid the causes of the failure of the 2009 device , " the official said , referring to the @entity17 incident			1
@entity3 officials believe @entity58 has more than 1,000 members in @entity103 and connections to @entity9 leadership in @entity106			1
the @entity103 affiliate has been behind two of the most audacious attempts to target the @entity3 in recent years : the attempted 2009 bombing and the printer bombs loaded onto cargo planes in 2010 and destined for an address in @entity114			0
in both cases , @entity3 authorities believe the bombs were built by @entity118			0
both devices contained a main charge of @entity121 , a white powdery explosive that conventional " single beam " x-ray machines are rarely able to detect			0
in 2009 , @entity118 fitted out his own brother , @entity125 , with a petn - based underwear bomb to kill prince @entity127 , a top @entity128 security official			2
the device killed his brother instantly but failed to kill its target			0
senior @entity9 operative killed by airstrike in @entity103 the government of @entity103 has been fighting @entity58 for years , with mixed results			2
on sunday , a senior @entity58 operative wanted for his role in the @entity139 was killed by an airstrike in @entity103 , officials said			2
@entity141 , 37 , was killed while riding in a vehicle in the @entity144 district in @entity146 province			0
he was hit by a @entity148 drone strike , @entity3 officials told @entity1			2
the weekend attack plus the foiled airline plot delivered a " one - two punch " against @entity58 , said the senior administration official			1
" this was a key victory for us			0
it also reminds us , though , that this war is not going to end in @entity157			0
@entity9 has metastasized and morphed			0
and they are constantly attempting to find new ways to get at us , " said @entity62			0
@entity1 's national security contributor @entity161 , @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
