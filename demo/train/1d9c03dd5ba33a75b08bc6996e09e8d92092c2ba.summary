-- children living in the @entity3 city of @entity4 watch the sky			1
not for signs of winter 's approach , although the cold winds are already blowing , but for the barrel bombs , mortars and shellfire they know will not distinguish between military targets and their families ' homes			2
it is hard to be a child -- or to have a childhood -- in @entity4			1
the litany of deprivation and endangerment is long			0
indiscriminate attacks have reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble			1
across the city , more than a half - million displaced people are living in appalling conditions , struggling every day to find safe drinking water , enough food to feed their children , fuel , or even a warm place to sleep			0
most hospitals are closed and most doctors and health professionals have been either killed , forced to flee , or unable to go to work			1
interruptions in immunization programs have left tens of thousands of children more vulnerable to disease			1
the threat of attacks has driven some children underground into makeshift classrooms -- while others are learning in converted shops , mosques or empty buildings -- when they 're lucky enough to go to school at all			2
this has been the situation in @entity4 for more than two years			2
and while some parts of the city remain relatively calm , escalating violence in recent months has signaled ominously of worse days to come			0
despite all this , @entity4 is not a place without hope -- and there has been progress			2
working with communities and local authorities , humanitarian staff are reaching some children and families in need across the city			0
in recent months , @entity66 convoys , including those led by @entity68 , have been able to cross conflict lines , bringing with them critical supplies to help children suffering from a lack of nutrition and to increase the availability of safe water and improved sanitation			0
in all the hardest - hit areas of @entity3 -- in @entity4 , in @entity80 and in @entity81 -- we are doing all we can to reach the hardest to reach children and families with therapeutic foods , water purification supplies , warm clothing , school supplies and textbooks , and other critical assistance as winter descends			1
of course , we are acutely aware that this assistance is not enough			0
not even close to enough , when there are up to 2 million people in the troubled city of @entity4 alone -- including 250,000 children and families in eastern @entity4 who are cut off from regular humanitarian assistance			1
when hundreds of thousands of children can not be reached in rural @entity97 due to fighting and siege			0
when the nation 's youngest children have known nothing but war and adolescents are coming of age in a culture of conflict			2
the reality is that an entire generation of @entity3 children is at risk , not only from violence itself , but also for want of education , protection and emotional support to help them overcome the trauma they have been suffering for nearly four brutal years			1
without these critical necessities , how will they have the ability and the desire to rebuild their country someday ? we must reach them , not only for the good our support can provide today , but for the hope for tomorrow it can help keep alive			0
for children who have been robbed of nearly everything , it is a reminder that they have not been forgotten			0
in the end , the only solutions for @entity4 , and for @entity3 and for the region -- are political solutions			1
but in the meantime , the children of @entity4 need protection now			1
and we need unconditional , unrestricted humanitarian access from all sides now			0
before another bomb or shell drops .			0

an entire generation of @entity3 children is at risk , says @entity151
indiscriminate attacks have left entire neighborhoods in rubble , @entity151 says
@entity157 : most of @entity4 's hospitals are closed
