@entity0 is sending astronaut @entity2 to live on the @entity3 for a year			1
that 's the longest any @entity6 astronaut has spent in space and twice as long as crew members usually stay on the space station			1
a year is a long time to stay anyplace			2
but staying a year in space has some special challenges			1
there 's what to pack : how many changes of clothes do you bring ? @entity2 says @entity0 supplies most of what he needs but he 's taking his own tool pouch , some sweatshirts and special shoes to use when he 's lifting weights			1
" i bought a special kind of shoes i thought would be better for that , " @entity2 said at a @entity0 briefing on thursday			1
then there 's what to do for a year in space			1
you get a great view of @entity29 , so the scenery is amazing			0
but the space station orbits @entity29 about every 90 minutes , or about 16 times a day			2
could get a little repetitive			0
so how do you keep from getting bored ? experiments			0
lots and lots of experiments			0
@entity0 says space station crews normally work on about 200 experiments over six months , but @entity2 will be doing many more			1
he says he 's actually fascinated with the space station itself as a giant experiment in living in space			1
" building this facility that allows us to understand how to operate for long periods of time in space to allow us someday to go to @entity47			0
" in his free time @entity2 says he 'll spend a lot of time talking to people on @entity29 , messaging on social media , reading email , watching tv and writing			1
" i 'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience , " @entity2 said			1
he also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long - term space flight			0
will he tell all ? " i plan to be completely honest about it , " he said , but ... " who knows , maybe there are some crazy thoughts i 'll have at the end that i would n't want to share			0
" @entity2 also might get to do a bit of singing			2
@entity70 singer @entity69 will visit the station as a space tourist during @entity2 's year in orbit			1
will he and the other crew members sing along with her ? " it will be either all of us or none of us , " @entity2 joked			2
one other thing @entity2 has to plan for : near - zero gravity			2
turns out our bodies really like gravity			0
stay in orbit too long and your eyes , heart , bones , muscles -- basically everything -- change , and usually not for the better			0
on the upside , you get a bit taller			0
" you do grow when you 're up there for a long time , " @entity2 said			2
" unfortunately it does n't last			0
but it did last long enough that i could stand next to my brother and look down at him a little bit			0
" @entity2 was joking about his twin , former astronaut @entity98 ( who is also known for being the husband of former rep. @entity100 )			1
@entity98 has volunteered for @entity0 's " @entity101 " -- 10 investigations into how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments			1
even though @entity98 will be on @entity29 getting poked and prodded by researchers while @entity2 makes history in orbit , @entity2 said his brother does n't mind			1
" he thinks it 's great that he can still be a participant in this , " @entity2 said			1
the @entity2 brothers ' experiments should help @entity0 understand what happens to astronauts who spend a long time in space and help plan longer spaceflights to an asteroid or to @entity47			1
despite all the health risks and personal sacrifices , @entity2 said there 's a big reason to stay in space a year			1
" it 's a lot of fun , " he said			0
" space station is a magical place			0
" the mission is a first for @entity0 , but not for @entity130			0
between 1987 and 1995 , four cosmonauts spent a year or more in space			2
and another @entity130 will be with @entity2 for his yearlong mission : cosmonaut @entity134			2
both men are space veterans			0
@entity2 has flown on two shuttle missions and has already done two stints on the space station			1
in all , he 's logged more than 180 days in space			2
@entity134 has spent 176 days in space			0
the two will ride to the space station on a @entity130 @entity145 spacecraft along with @entity130 cosmonaut @entity146 , who is staying for six months			0
the trio will launch from the @entity148 in @entity149 on march 27 .			0

@entity2 's twin brother , @entity98 , will take part in a " twins study " from the ground
