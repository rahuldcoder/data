@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 are singing slightly different tunes on the threat of @entity6			1
sen. @entity3 , an ophthalmologist and likely presidential contender , has been generating headlines for his stark warnings about the virus , urging a temporary flight suspension from certain @entity12 countries and suggesting @entity6 is much more contagious than the government says			1
his father , former rep. @entity2 , who 's also a physician , appears to feel differently			1
in a column out sunday , he sounds less distressed about the potential of the virus spreading in the @entity18 and does n't seem to think airline restrictions will do much good			0
@entity21 not naming @entity6 ' czar ' the former presidential candidate -- an obstetrician with a strong libertarian following -- does n't mention banning flights as a possible solution			2
instead , he writes that safety concerns can best be handled by the airlines themselves , which he says would have a greater incentive to protect passengers than governments would			0
" they can do so while providing a safe means of travel for those seeking medical treatment in the @entity18 , " he writes			0
" this would remove the incentive to lie about exposure to the virus among those seeking to come here for treatment			0
" questions remain about how @entity45 nurse got @entity6 while his son , a @entity46 from @entity47 , has speculated that the virus can be transmitted via cough particles in the air , @entity2 calls it " very difficult to contract			1
" " common - sense precautions should be able to prevent @entity6 from spreading , " he writes			1
government officials have said the virus can only be transmitted through bodily fluids			0
but they 've also said they would look closely at cases in which individuals had direct contact with @entity6 patients , including getting sneezed or coughed on			2
but @entity2 dedicates part of his opinion piece on accusing the @entity18 government for partially propping up the virus by sending foreign aid to countries like @entity66			2
ebola outbreak : get up to speed with the latest according to @entity2 's logic , private investment rather that government money would help countries develop a competitive , more effective medical infrastructure			1
" the people of @entity66 and other countries would be better off if the @entity18 government left them alone , " he writes			0
" leave it to private citizens to invest in @entity12 business and trade with the @entity12 people			0
" it 's no surprise that the two men do n't fall perfectly in line on the topic			0
@entity3 has long taken different policy stances and opinions that those of his father			2
@entity88 ' doubling down ' on @entity6 training efforts but as the senator prepares for a potential presidential bid and as @entity2 remains a vocal activist who frequently weighs in on the issues , their differences shed light on the politically famous father - son pair and how a @entity3 for president campaign would look all the more different from @entity2 's three @entity21 bids .			1

@entity2 and @entity3 are both physicians and *prominent* politicians .
@entity2 writes in a new op - ed that @entity6 is ' very difficult to *attract* ' .
his son has been taking a different tone , arguing that it 's more contagious than thought .
