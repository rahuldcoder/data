@entity0 -- as the @entity6 cleared the way for consideration of gun control measures for the first time in nearly 20 years , the path ahead for any gun control measure in the @entity5 - led @entity4 is rocky and uncertain			1
@entity6 overcomes filibuster , clearing the way for debate on gun bill family members of those killed in the tragic shooting in @entity18 , @entity19 , spent three days shuffling from meeting to meeting with senators urging swift action			1
but across the @entity24 , there is no sense of urgency as most rank and file @entity4 @entity5 members are taking a wait and see approach to moving any gun bill , while a bloc of @entity5 members are solidly against considering new gun restrictions			1
manchin to @entity35 parents : ' i can do something ' house speaker @entity38 of @entity39 repeated his long held position that the @entity4 would review whatever emerged from the @entity6			2
he was noncommittal about bringing gun legislation to the @entity4 floor for a vote			2
@entity45 , @entity46 to introduce background checks in @entity4 " i fully expect that the @entity4 will act in some way , shape or form but to make a blanket commitment without knowing what the underlying bill is i think would be irresponsible on my part , " @entity38 told reporters on thursday			1
unlike senators , many of whom represent diverse states that include urban and suburban constituencies pressing for new gun restrictions , @entity4 districts are more narrowly drawn along partisan lines , and the current @entity4 is dominated by members in reliably @entity5 seats who feel less pressure to act			1
in many cases , these members are getting lobbied from constituents to hold the line against anything they think could curb access to guns			0
sen. @entity76 : the government wants your gun rights " you have a lot of members here who are still scared of the @entity87 , " @entity82 rep @entity80 of @entity83 , a gun control advocate , said on wednesday			1
gun control advocates are hopeful the @entity6 deal struck by pro-gun sens. @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92 , @entity93 , a key conservative , on expanding background checks will help provide cover for @entity5 in the @entity4 who might be worried about backlash for supporting it			1
while it appears @entity92 's top billing is helping , so far most rank and file @entity4 @entity5 say they want proof the @entity6 can actually pass something			1
meanwhile , they continue to call for the @entity102 administration to enforce current gun laws , and emphasize there is bipartisan support to address mental health issues over measures dealing with access to guns			0
@entity110 rep. @entity110 , who hails from @entity90 's home state and is running for an open @entity6 seat there in 2014 , said the @entity6 proposal " has got problems			1
it 's very unpopular in the state			0
" @entity110 said her office is already getting a lot of calls from voters in her district who oppose it , and estimated the current breakdown of the calls is roughly nine callers against gun control legislation for every one caller who says @entity129 needs to pass something			2
but @entity110 said she still wants to see the fine print of the @entity6 plan			0
a bipartisan duo in the @entity4 -- rep. @entity45 , @entity134 - @entity83 , and @entity82 rep. @entity46 , @entity135 -- plan to introduce a @entity4 version of the background check bill early this week			1
@entity45 said there would likely be fewer than 10 @entity139 supporting it at first , but he said many @entity5 colleagues want to wait to see what happens in the @entity6			2
@entity45 said it was too early to gauge the chances for the background check bill in the @entity4 , but stressed , " the biggest swing factor will be if a number of ' @entity92 - like ' @entity139 support it in the @entity6 and it just creates a wave			1
" @entity46 argued the national polls showing a public outcry for action mean @entity38 and other @entity4 @entity5 leaders ca n't ignore the issue for long			2
@entity1 poll : popular background checks also cause worry @entity1 poll : importance of guns soars , as do gun owner concerns gun rights activist : ' your polls are hokum ' " i can not imagine how the majority in the @entity4 could even think of not taking this bill up for a vote , especially after you 've seen this breakthrough bipartisan support in the @entity6			1
this is n't about the leadership of the majority party throttling @entity129			0
this is about the @entity171 people wanting a vote , wanting background checks			0
" why is this so hard ? the disconnect on background checks and guns would background checks have stopped recent mass shootings ? how do background checks work ? moderate @entity5 rep. @entity180 , who represents one of a few swing districts in @entity93 , noted that the @entity87 backed a similar measure adopted by his home state in the 1990s requiring background checks for pistols			1
@entity92 called @entity180 and other @entity139 earlier this week seeking their support before he unveiled his plan			0
@entity180 called the @entity6 compromise " a proposal really worthy of serious consideration " and while he has n't fully endorsed it , he is on record pushing for enhanced background check legislation			1
@entity87 : @entity6 compromise ' will not prevent the next shooting ' asked if @entity92 helps attract support from his @entity5 colleagues , @entity180 said , " i suspect the answer to that question will largely depend on where you live			1
i suspect those who are from states like @entity93 , also the northeast , @entity206 area might bring some measure of comfort to @entity4 members knowing that sen. @entity92 supports this			1
" others agreed @entity92 's top billing helps with @entity4 conservatives , but only to a degree			2
" what it does do is it forces you to look at it seriously , as it should			0
i do n't think on issues like this , however , it will impact how people will vote in one way or another , " said rep. @entity221 , @entity222			0
@entity93 @entity228 rep. @entity228 , a former federal prosecutor who represents a suburban area outside @entity230 , said he 's already on board with the @entity6 plan			2
he said the background check piece along with other provisions " could be a promising package ( in the @entity4 ) and something that could be sold			1
" @entity46 said thursday he and @entity45 are in discussions with seven to eight additional @entity139 about signing on to that bill			0
in recent high - profile legislative debates , such as the fiscal cliff , @entity38 has passed final measures with a majority of his own members opposing them			0
but @entity245 @entity244 rep. @entity244 , an ardent gun rights advocate , is circulating a letter to @entity38 warning him not to allow a vote on any gun bill unless a majority of @entity4 @entity5 are on board			1
the letter , signed by 46 @entity139 so far , argues the background check measure violates the @entity253 and would n't be an effective crime - fighting tool			2
it concludes " under the precedents and traditions of the @entity4 , we would ask that no gun legislation be brought to the floor of the @entity4 unless it has the support of a majority of our caucus			0
" asked if he 'll adhere to the test of only allowing a vote on a bill if it has the support of the majority of his own members , @entity38 left some room on thursday : " certainly my prerogative or my intention is to always pass bills with strong @entity5 support			2
" senior @entity4 @entity5 aides caution that while the @entity6 may pass a bill soon , that does n't necessarily mean the @entity4 will take up the proposal			1
they note that the process in the @entity6 took several months			0
@entity4 @entity5 do expect president @entity102 to ramp up political pressure and keep the issue out front to try to force action , but one of these senior @entity4 @entity5 sources suggested the @entity284 refrain from any attempt to squeeze members			2
" if the president really wants to get something done it is not the best strategy to try and jam the @entity4			0
that has n't proven to be effective in the past , " this aide told @entity1			0
in gun debate , @entity291 cites paranoia , @entity294 but @entity80 insisted this time around the pro-gun control effort is just getting started and is more organized to turn the pressure on @entity4 members after the @entity6 acts			1
pointing to public opinion polls showing overwhelming support among women for gun legislation , @entity80 pledged , " we 're showing our power and that power is not going to go away			0
i think it 's going to be more difficult for them when they go home and have n't voted for something to save lives			0
" @entity312 makes emotional entrance into gun debate opinion : a mother 's journey to bearing arms @entity110 said the shooting in @entity18 that left 20 children and six educators dead was a " wake - up call " and believes the @entity4 will ultimately vote on some package			0
but she stressed because the issue was politically sensitive it should go through " regular order , " meaning committees will hold hearings and spend time going through proposals			0
that means it will be many weeks , and likely months , before the @entity4 moves anything .			0
