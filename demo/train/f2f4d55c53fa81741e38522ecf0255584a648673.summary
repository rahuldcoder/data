the @entity0 is a matter of days away but whether you are using an abacus or calculator the numbers just do n't add up			2
president @entity7 's reputation is on the line and no expense has been spared to stage the @entity10 next month			1
the 2014 @entity0 will be the most expensive in the history of the @entity0 -- $ 50 billion and rising			1
@entity12 in 2008 cost an estimated $ 40 billion , though the exact cost is not known			1
but just what has that $ 50 billion been spent on ? former deputy prime minister @entity15 , a fierce critic of @entity7 , has questioned where $ 20 - 30 billion has gone in a report titled " @entity0 in the @entity17 : corruption and abuse in @entity20 , " which was published in @entity21 in december			1
@entity15 , now the leader of the @entity23 opposition , estimates that that missing money could have paid for " 3,000 high - quality roads , housing for 800,000 people or thousands of ice palaces and soccer fields all over @entity23			2
" the report also says the absence of " honest competition , cronyism and censorship " have led to an increase in cost and decrease in the quality of work in preparing for the @entity10			2
@entity40 , president of @entity20 's @entity41 , is dismissive of such claims			1
" the rest of the money , which sometimes appears in the media , is just imagination and calculation that has nothing to do with the reality , " he told @entity43			2
in 2007 , @entity7 advised the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) that his country would spend $ 12 billion on the @entity10			1
however , @entity15 's report claimed the final expenditure -- " given the average world parameters for the increase in costs " — should have been double that figure			2
" the remainder — $ 26 billion — consists of embezzlement and kickbacks , " it said			1
" it is no secret that the preparation for the @entity0 in @entity23 has been accompanied by unprecedented corruption			1
" the 17 - day event , which begins on february 7 , has become a target for @entity7 's opponents -- who believe the @entity23 leader is guilty of making the @entity10 into a " personal project " as he extensively overhauls a faded seaside resort town that is the focal point of " @entity23 's @entity75			1
" as well as the @entity0 , @entity20 will host @entity23 's first @entity77 race in october			2
" this is not about sport , this is about triumphing in politics , " @entity15 told @entity43			2
" this is about the strength of power of the @entity23 president in the world and inside @entity23			1
" that is why he is responsible for everything , including nature and weather			2
" @entity15 's assertion that @entity7 has tried to control the weather refers to the challenge posed by @entity20 's subtropical climate , which has required the storage of snow collected during the previous winter			1
both the opening and closing ceremonies will take place close to the @entity100 in an area which was once rife with mosquitos -- even in winter , the daytime temperature on the coast is an average @entity105 ( 50f )			0
@entity40 , however , remains unruffled by the report 's claims			0
he insists all venues and arenas will be ready for the opening ceremony and the arrival of 6,000 athletes			0
" for us as organizers and for @entity23 as a whole , this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity to take the floor in front of the multi-billion audience , " he said			0
" we have to convince the world , to showcase the new modern @entity23 to all of the world and say , ' look we 're different to the stereotypes , we are modern , we are transparent , we 're efficient and we 're successful			0
' " what rankles @entity15 and the co-writer of his report , activist @entity125 of the @entity23 solidarity movement , is the vast amount of money being spent on the event			0
according to the report , the exorbitant rise from $ 12 billion to $ 50 billion can only be explained by " banal thievery , corruption and complete lack of professionalism of the contractors			1
" the report claims the standard of work carried out on venues is of a low quality and is a danger to the environment			0
it says sewage pipes have burst and the @entity100 has been polluted by construction waste , while the forests have been cut down amid increased spending			1
these accusations have been strongly denied by @entity40 , who says his operational budget is " very average			0
" " to avoid speculation i would point to two budgets , which is following from our contractual obligation from the candidature file , from the bidding campaign , " he told @entity43			0
" @entity159 of all this is a separate budget to host the @entity10 that i 'm in charge of , this is roughly the same as the previous @entity0 organizers , around $ 2.2 billion			1
" then the construction budget , to build our state - of - the - art venues and related infrastructure , both competition and non-competition venues , and some environment like sewerage system , power system , some connecting roads etc. " this budget is also very transparent , it 's in the governmental program number 991			0
so you can visit the website and learn your figures yourself			0
" it 's roughly dependent on currency fluctuation , something around $ 7 billion dollars , and half of this money is coming from the public fund			1
" @entity40 admitted there has been overspending on the ski jump in the mountain cluster of venues , which has required surgery on more than one occasion			0
that was explained in part by the " awful geological conditions " but @entity40 said the structure would be ready in time and the " expenditure to be balanced			0
" @entity7 fired the official responsible for the ski jump ; he 's since left the country to escape prosecution			1
however @entity15 's report did not just highlight the cost incongruities it also criticizes the treatment of migrant workers			0
it claims 25 people were killed during 40 accidents at @entity41 construction sites and says money promised to workers ended up in the pockets of contractors			0
that led to , in @entity15 's his opinion , a number of protests , which included local resident @entity218 , who was allegedly abused and tortured by police officers after demanding his full wages for work at one of the @entity41 construction sites			0
the report also claims that @entity232 , who had taken part in the building of the main media center at the @entity236 , " sewed his mouth shut as a sign of protest against the non-payment of wages and demonstrated at the entrance of the media center with several posters			0
" " sometimes they pay them nothing , " said @entity15			0
" so for me this is the first indication there is corruption			1
" but there are no criminal cases for corruption in preparation for the @entity0 -- there 's no fraud case			1
" there should be an investigation into corruption not just in @entity23 but i 'm sure the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) is involved			1
" they have immunity like international diplomats and the police will never investigate because they have protection			0
" the @entity51 rejected the allegations in a statement given to @entity43			2
it read : " this looks like pure uninformed speculation			0
the @entity51 has shown consistently that when there are tangible allegations we take the appropriate action			2

the @entity266 is set to be most expensive in history
total spending is expected to reach $ 50 billion
