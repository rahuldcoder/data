-- the @entity2 actress featured in a racy cover shot in the december edition of a men 's magazine in @entity7 told @entity0 she posed topless but not completely naked			2

@entity20 said @entity11 doctored the photographs to show her without clothes and has now revealed plans to sue the publication			1
" i admit that i have done a bold shoot , " she said , " but i was not nude			2
there is a big difference between topless and being nude			2
" you will see various shoots here in the @entity33 industry where the actresses actually went topless but they were covered like the way i was			2
" in a telephone call with @entity0 , @entity20 said she had declined an offer a couple of months ago by an " international ( media ) agency " to pose nude for a fee but agreed to do a shoot for @entity42 instead -- and without charges -- because it was a " personality " shoot			1
" what i have lost is priceless , " she said			2
but @entity42 says @entity20 knew the terms all along and approved the photos			1
the publication is even demanding a public apology and has threatened to counter-sue @entity20 for defamation			1
" she was completely aware of the cover , " said @entity11 editor @entity51			1
" she was completely aware of the concept			0
lawyer @entity57 told @entity0 that @entity20 is seeking $ 1.9 million in damages , saying the magazine " cheated " his client and doctored the nude pictures			1
in a legal notice served to the magazine , @entity20 contends that it was @entity51 's idea for her to wear the painted on @entity15 tattoo ; she was told it would be good for her image			1
in another photo , which was originally slated for the cover , she is shown holding a grenade in her right hand			0
@entity11 published the grenade photo inside , with a line plastered across it : " the cover we did n't use			1
" @entity20 said the shoot was supposed to create positive feelings , not negative ones			1
she added that the controversy has affected her family , particularly her father			0
" he did not speak to me			0
he spoke to one of the media groups and like he was ( crying ) , i mean he was too upset ... okay i mean i do n't blame him for that			0
" but the actress and model is no stranger to controversy			0
she triggered uproar two years ago when she claimed that her former boyfriend , @entity2 cricketer @entity88 , was involved in spot - fixing international matches			0
@entity88 was found guilty last month in an @entity91 court			0
a year later , the actress came under fire from @entity2 clerics who decried her behavior in the @entity7 reality tv show " @entity97 , " as " un-islamic			2
" " i am not a perfect @entity98 or a perfect person , but i have n't committed a crime , and unfortunately things like this are part and parcel of the industry i work in , " @entity20 said			1
still , she downplayed her criticism back home			0
" i am not bothered about what they think , " she said			0
" my fans and many @entity2 support me and believe ( in ) me			0
