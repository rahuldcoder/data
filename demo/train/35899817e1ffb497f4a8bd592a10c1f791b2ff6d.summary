we were not the first round of protesters this prison cell had seen			1
on the beige walls , former residents had scratched " @entity6 , " " love " and an expletive about the police			1
at 1 @entity11 in @entity12 , our cell was 5 - by - 7 , freezing cold , with a padded bench just long enough for three of us to sit on			1
a fourth woman was curled on the floor			1
in the corner , there was a non-functioning sink and a toilet			1
when one woman needed to use it , we formed a line to block her from the male officers			1
in the 10 hours i was held , there was one meal : four slices of bread in soggy @entity30 wrap , a packet of mayo and a mini carton of milk			1
last year , @entity6 happened outside of my window			1
as a local , i was supposed to deplore those " dirty hippies			1
" but i found i could n't			1
@entity38 's art in @entity40 's digital gallery at the time , i made my living drawing for ferociously swanky nightclubs while watching the world crumble and people from @entity45 to @entity46 take to the streets			1
everyone said that @entity49 were too apathetic for that sort of thing			1
while i was initially skeptical , occupy soon won me over			1
across the street , @entity52 had transformed into a mini-city where anyone could get a book , a meal and basic medical care for free			1
i was inspired by seeing @entity49 , of all backgrounds and beliefs , caring passionately about income inequality and financial corruption			1
i wanted to help however i could			1
i turned my apartment into a press room , offering coffee and @entity66 for journalists filing copy about the young movement			1
i donated money and marched in protests			2
while i have been political before , i never let it seep into my artwork			2
now i created posters , some of which ended up on the streets as protest signs hours after i uploaded them to the @entity79			1
these posters remain some of the work of which i am most proud			2
on the morning of my arrest , i was n't sure whether the @entity6 movement was over			1
i went to the demonstration out of loyalty and nostalgia for the days of the @entity90 camps			2
the people 's library , free clothes and gourmet soup kitchen were gone now , or reduced to shadows of their former selves			1
but i wanted to pay homage to the movement that had brought out more of my artistic voice			1
at seven in the morning i was on the sidewalk outside my apartment , tweeting pictures of the marchers and police			2
the @entity105 had turned lower @entity106 into a mess of checkpoints			2
in that way , they were ridiculously effective at disrupting traffic			2
there were hundreds of cops -- some in riot gear , some on horseback			2
there were trucks piled high with metal barricades			2
some were on the street , most like me cautiously stayed on the sidewalk			2
we shouted the shopworn protest chants that feel so meaningful when you 're chanting them			1
at one corner , i saw a cop grabbing the arm of a woman in front of me and pulling her into the street			2
it was the same gesture you might use to escort an old lady , and , when the next officer did this to me , that is what i thought it was			2
but then , halfway across the street , he cuffed my hands behind my back			2
no @entity146 rights like in the movies			2
at first , i was incredulous			2
it was not until i got my desk ticket that night for blocking traffic that i had any idea what the officer was accusing me of doing			2
i was a head shorter than the officer			0
@entity155 said to him , " you know i was on the sidewalk			0
" he would n't meet my eyes			0
i was two blocks from my apartment			0
but because i was part of a protest , i was no longer a local			1
i was an obstruction to be cleared			0
going into the police van , they snapped my picture on a @entity169 knockoff , hipster party style			0
i gave them my best grin			0
a man in a suit passed by , looked us over , and said to the police , " nice work			0
" in the van , there were eight people , including an elderly nurse and a legal observer in his official green cap			1
we had all been plucked off the sidewalk			0
i edged my cell phone out of my purse , texted friends about my arrest and then , bored , began dissecting the situation on @entity192			0
i regretted being such a random little duck , pointlessly arrested to stop the protests			1
in the police yard , we traded our bags for vouchers			0
we waited to have our pockets searched while our shoulders ached from an hour in zip - cuffs			0
the woman in front of me had wrist injuries			0
the searching officer yelled that her wrist braces were weapons and threatened to send her through central booking -- " the tombs " -- where everything took twice as long and was covered in filth			0
pointless , tedious waiting in a crowded cage with dead roaches and no running water , where officers processing you through the system laugh at your discomfort and fear			0
the women sang songs to pass the time			0
" " @entity225 will come up tomorrow			0
" the booking officer screamed she 'd send us all to the tombs if we did n't shut up			0
soon you find yourself banging on cell bars in unison , amplifying the voice of protesters who needed medicine , or who did n't get their phone calls for eight hours			0
when the male prisoners burst into cheers , we shushed each other and grinned			0
i was the last person released from my cell			0
the woman who left before me , a middle - aged lawyer who had been arrested multiple times that weekend , reassured me that i 'd get out soon			1
when i did , friends were waiting with hugs , pizza and the @entity247			0
occupiers have a strong support system for those who are arrested , whether it 's in the form of food , drinks or a pro bono lawyer			1
i felt incredibly lucky , essentially a tourist in that miserable place			0
in the pizza joint across the street , we bought beer for a woman who 'd been held for 38 hours			0
while i was alone before my release , pacing back and forth , it was almost impossible not to suspect that i was stupid , that my actions were futile			0
which is the point of an arrest			0
getting arrested for a social protest is like being put through aversion therapy , a punishment in and of itself			1
a relative of mine , an occupy supporter , said that after my arrest , she 'd never protest again			1
and that 's the point			0
me ? i 'd be back			0
@entity6 taught many middle - class white people what poor people and people of color had already known			1
the law is often a hostile and arbitrary thing			0
speak too loudly , stand in the wrong place , and you 're on the wrong side of it			0
my experience was infinitely easier than most			0
many people arrested came out to a lost job , or they have to deal with nerve - damaged hands from being in cuffs for too long , or they face a society that believes they asked for it			1
while we were in the cell , after we banged too long and chanted too hard , an officer stared at us			0
" look at you people , " she said			1
" what do you hope to accomplish ? you brought this on yourselves			0

@entity300 : i was arrested for taking part in an @entity6 rally
@entity38 : i was inspired to see people care passionately about inequality issues
she says getting arrested for a social protest is like being put through aversion therapy
@entity38 : the movement won me over , i would protest again
