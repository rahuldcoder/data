@entity0 -- no science or religion can accurately predict what will happen in @entity5			1
but looking plainly at the political chess board and listening to sources on @entity9 , there is plenty of reason to think that a shutdown of the federal government wo n't happen , at least not next week			1
here 's why : politics			2
" let 's put it this way , " sen. @entity14 , @entity15 , told @entity1			2
" i 'm not about to shut down the government and have @entity19 take the blame for it			1
it 's just that simple			2
" bluntly , many republicans fear they will be blamed for a shutdown , just months before a big congressional election year			1
this makes them highly motivated to find a way to keep government running			1
a @entity1 / @entity30 poll in mid-september showed 51 % of people would hold republicans in @entity5 responsible for a shutdown versus 40 % for president @entity34			1
house speaker @entity35 , @entity36 , might already be in this camp			0
he initially proposed a spending bill that would have avoided a standoff			0
conservatives forced him to go to war with a different version fully defunding @entity43 , but @entity35 's opening move was an important signal that he wants to sidestep a shutdown			1
@entity47 fed up over @entity49 shutdown battle there may be some learned behavior from history here , too			1
" i saw this movie before , i saw what happened before , " said sen. @entity53 , @entity54 , talking about the sting @entity19 felt after the shutdowns in 1995 and 1996			1
" that 's what happened the last time we tried this , " he concluded			0
bottom line : ideal or not , @entity5 runs on political currency			1
and multiple @entity66 @entity19 aides tell @entity1 that the majority of the @entity32 in their conference fear a shutdown would cost them with voters			1
the next fights republicans are divided over how far to take the @entity43 battle right now			0
and @entity19 leaders also are preparing a second @entity43 fight during the upcoming debt ceiling debate			0
so , they have the option of dropping the @entity79 push from the shutdown debate now and instead including it in the debt ceiling fight coming up			1
at the same time , @entity82 are eager to get past the shutdown debate so they can move on to the debt ceiling and start to deal with yet another fight : budget cuts slated to hit in january at the latest			1
the numbers @entity19 have 233 members in the @entity66 , 16 votes more than a majority			0
those 233 are divided over how far to take the @entity43 fight , over whether to ultimately shut down government in the name of defunding the health care law			1
this year , funding measures repeatedly have passed the @entity66 with a bipartisan coalition			0
take a look at the @entity99 funding vote			0
or the last debt ceiling increase			0
or the march vote to avoid a government shutdown			1
sure , every vote is different			0
but a bipartisan safety net has magically rolled out during the last funding standoffs			0
deadline pressure something happens in the day or two before a potential shutdown			1
whatever the atmosphere and seemingly - firm positioning now , things will ramp up fast if @entity5 gets closer to a shutdown , especially a shutdown that would go in place during a work week			1
workers ask if they will be sent home without pay			0
troops ( and their families ) worry if their paychecks will be delayed			0
families may start to cancel vacations			0
that is the moment when incredible political pressure against a shutdown builds			2
the deadline itself finally , we come to a public secret			0
the government does not necessarily have to shut down at the end of the day on september 30			2
yes , at midnight , funding officially runs out for most programs			0
but if lawmakers are close to a deal , the president can order agencies to keep running for a few hours or perhaps even a day or two for @entity5 to pass the legislation			1
@entity141 : @entity43 this has happened before			0
at midnight at the end of april 8 , 2011 , the funding for most agencies officially ran out			0
but @entity82 and @entity19 had struck a funding deal a few hours before , it just had not passed through @entity5 yet			1
so the @entity34 administration told agencies to hold off with any shutdown plans because a spending bill was likely to become law soon			2
in that case , it waived just a few hours of shutdown , but sources in both parties at the @entity9 have confirmed that the president can do this for a longer period if a deal is emerging			2
again , @entity5 works best on deadlines , and the shutdown deadline is not quite as firm as people might think			1
why a shutdown ( still ) might happen all this said , you can not underestimate the swirling , unpredictable dynamics in @entity5 at the moment and @entity32 ' gut - level objections to @entity43			1
once the @entity171 passes its version of a spending bill , @entity66 @entity19 are considering attaching another item to it			0
that could be a one - year delay in the individual insurance mandate in @entity43 , a repeal of a medical device tax , a change in how the government handles congressional employee health plans or possibly something in support of the @entity186 pipeline			2
how this affects you a spending bill with something @entity19 want and @entity82 do n't would set up a late game of chicken between the @entity66 , @entity171 and president			0
if no one blinks , which is possible , this would lead to a shutdown			2
it 's unclear whether @entity32 will do this			0
it is also unclear how @entity82 would react			0
but this scenario is the reason there is still a chance a shutdown could happen .			2

the federal government is facing a possible shutdown next week
the government has been here before in 1995 and 1996
history may give @entity5 pause before *embarking* on another shutdown
