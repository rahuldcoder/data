-- the @entity2 's @entity1 tentatively approved legislation tuesday that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in the nation 's capital			1
currently , someone caught possessing marijuana in @entity2 faces a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine			1
that would change if the measure becomes law , making it ok to possess small amounts of pot in the @entity2 and reducing the punishment for use in public			1
approved 11 - 1 this week , the bill will get another vote and then would need the signature of @entity26 mayor @entity25			0
but activists here think the @entity1 is moving too slowly			1
they 've filed language for a ballot initiative legalizing possession of 2 ounces of marijuana for adults			1
if the @entity1 does n't expand the scope of the reform in the current legislation to their satisfaction , activists will put the question to the voters in november			1
it 's a near certainty the legalization measure will pass if it reaches the ballot			0
so why should the rest of the country care what happens with @entity2 's marijuana laws ? the last time the @entity2 adopted a law that ran contrary to the federal government 's absolute marijuana prohibition ( a medical marijuana law in 1998 ) , @entity48 leaders in @entity49 responded by blocking it			1
they heartlessly denied seriously ill people with cancer and @entity57 the opportunity to use or access medical marijuana for over a decade			0
in 2009 , i worked with the original author of the law banning implementation , former @entity48 @entity63 rep. @entity48 , and together we lobbied his former colleagues to undo the damage he had done			0
that fall , @entity49 removed the ban on the @entity2 's medical marijuana law , and the city government slowly made conforming regulations and brought the program online			1
socially conservative @entity48 , often enabled by @entity26 too afraid to speak their real opinions about marijuana laws , generally serve as a good indicator of the expected national response to evolving drug policies			0
instead of moving to block final implementation of @entity2 's medical marijuana law last year , opponents in @entity49 were silent			1
the first legal sale of marijuana to an hiv - positive man in june occurred without warnings that the sky would fall as a result			2
six months later in @entity90 , the first legal sales to adults started and , again , no claims that the planet will spin off its axis			0
up in smoke : the @entity97 administration 's pot politics problem in fact , if you peeked into a hearing on @entity100 on tuesday called by @entity48 leadership to address the administration 's " mixed messages " on marijuana policy , you would have found the most productive debate on marijuana policy that i 've seen in more than a decade of working on this issue			2
@entity110 , the deputy director of the @entity112 's drug control office , even acknowledged under oath that he was not aware of a single overdose death from marijuana -- ever			2
the senior @entity48 who called the hearing , rep. @entity116 , was cordial to his @entity26 colleagues , one of whom alluded to @entity121 's support for allowing states to decide their own policies and call for fair treatment of businesses involved in the legal marijuana trade			1
now the attacks are coming from outside the government			0
some cynical drug warriors who have now left government service have figured out an effective , albeit untruthful and sensationalist , tactic to fight marijuana reform : comparing the legitimate marijuana business community to @entity135 , which notoriously and villainously lied to the @entity137 public for decades			0
they are led by former rep. @entity139 , @entity140 , who attacked president @entity97 's recent comments about marijuana , even questioning the president 's comments about disparate enforcement of marijuana laws on people of color			2
that a former congressman , part of an @entity137 political dynasty who has enjoyed incredible wealth and privilege his entire life -- who got a ride home from the police in @entity2 after crashing his car into a police barricade after taking medication , instead of getting shot or imprisoned -- would lecture the president on the nature of disparate racial enforcement around drug laws is outrageously ironic			1
regulating and taxing the sale of marijuana requires that someone grow , process and sell it			0
voters in @entity90 and @entity172 clearly said they would rather see upstanding business owners -- not cartels -- running those businesses			0
@entity139 and his ilk misunderstand the role of entrepreneurs , like the ones i work with , who are active in marijuana dispensaries and ancillary businesses			0
big marijuana ? the overwhelming majority of most clients are small businesses or individual consumers			2
does that sound like an evil shady big tobacco - type corporation that @entity139 warns of ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity1 voted to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana
@entity192 says it 's about time the city took that step
@entity2 's move is part of a *nationwide* trend to make marijuana legal , he says
