-- @entity1 has been accused of passing the problems of its long - neglected suburbs off to others , after the country 's @entity7 president @entity6 agreed to a deal in which @entity10 will invest millions of euros to help regenerate the disadvantaged " banlieues " of @entity13			1
the plan , which has been met with widespread criticism from across the political spectrum , was first put forward in november last year under the tenure of former president @entity18			1
@entity19 , a group representing local elected officials who advocate for diversity in deprived areas met with @entity24 , the emir of @entity10 last november , to secure an investment of 50 million euros			2
the vice-president of @entity19 , @entity27 , told @entity0 she had regularly been approached by young people brimming with ambitious projects , but had no financial backing to see them through			0
the idea behind the fund is to inspire hope in the poor , troubled @entity1 suburbs with high immigrant populations			2
but the plans were put on hold by @entity18 , for fear of jeopardizing his chances of re-election -- his infamous suggestion to " clean the suburbs with a high pressure hose " when acting as minister of the interior in 2005 had not been forgotten			0
the fund was given new life last week when members of @entity48 met with the @entity1 industrial recovery minister , @entity50 , who approved the plan and agreed to match @entity10 's investment , bringing the fund 's total to 100 million euros			1
with @entity10 already having made large investments in @entity1 utility companies such as @entity58 and @entity60 environment , as well as media group @entity61 , and more recently the purchase of @entity1 football club @entity63 , this latest announcement of @entity1 - @entity10 cooperation was met with heavy criticism by both the @entity1 left and right			1
@entity67 , the member of @entity68 for the center - right @entity69 ( @entity71 ) , called for a parliamentary investigation into @entity10 's " interest " in @entity1 in an open letter to the president of the @entity76			1
" it would not be troubling if @entity10 were a secular democracy or even a non-proselytising religious state			2
however , this country practices fundamentalist @entity81 , " @entity67 wrote			0
@entity82 , editor - in - chef of @entity1 's left wing newspaper liberation , questioned the motives behind the investment in an editorial			1
" to see @entity10 land in the @entity1 suburbs as a stand - in for a cash - strapped @entity1 deserves to be looked at twice , " @entity82 mused			1
@entity92 , head of @entity1 's far right @entity93 , whose presidential campaign played heavily on the fear of immigrants -- particularly those of @entity98 origins , also weighed in with a communique titled " @entity100 , " in which she accused @entity10 of investing in the " banlieues " because of the high number of @entity98 present there			1
" these investments are in no way for humanitarian reasons , they are political and religious			0
it is a major political mistake to accept this and it will come at the price of our independence not only in our country but also in the context of our international policy , " she wrote			0
@entity0 has sought comment from the @entity10 government and from @entity1 government officials on the plan , but has not yet received a response			2
@entity27 is concerned that the fund is proving divisive as the details of how the money will be spent are yet to be decided			0
she argues the investment will be a huge help to all those who are out of work			0
with the number of unemployed in @entity1 reaching three million in august -- the highest figure since 1999 -- she believes job creation would be welcomed .			0
