-- the sweater you would n't be caught dead in			0
the knicknack that does n't match your decor			0
the @entity6 ( they still make those ? ) you 'll never use			0
and it 's always that same great - aunt / wacky uncle / out - of - touch grandparent that gives it to you			0
the holidays are great when you get gifts that you want			0
yet there 's always something that does n't fit you or your style			1
and while we love to pretend that we love it , we 're really just silently searching for the gift receipt			2
if there is n't one , we wonder : can i ask to return this ? our experts answer that question : @entity29 , author of " @entity30 : a guide to @entity32 " i have a relative that returns or exchanges every gift they are given , even if it is something that they asked for			1
i just include the gift receipt and let it go			2
( surprisingly , they hate gift cards and think they are tacky ... go figure ! ! ) for most of us , unless the gift giver tells you that it 's ok for you to return it -- wrong size , for example -- then returning or exchanging the gift should not be an option ( unless you are a cad , or a relative , or both )			1
let 's assume the gift giver thought you would really like what they chose for you			2
if you do n't really want , need or like the gift , then after you 've expressed appropriate gratitude , put it in your regift closet and do something else with it later			2
( like use it for a " spare " ... ! ) @entity66 , great - granddaughter - in - law of @entity67 usually it 's ok to ask to return a gift , unless , let 's say , it 's something monogrammed			1
most people wo n't be hurt , especially if it just does n't fit you			1
show your gratitude and say , " i love it , but unfortunately that does n't fit / it 's way too small / is n't my style			1
" just do n't say : " i really hate it so would you mind if i exchange it ? " @entity82 , author of " @entity83 : @entity84 " if there is a compelling and inoffensive reason to return the gift ( wrong size , duplicate gift , damaged item , missing part ) , you might mention it to the giver and see if he / she offers to give you the receipt			1
in such cases , the giver might even offer to make the exchange for you			0
on the other hand , if there is any potential that making known your intentions to return the gift might hurt the giver 's feelings , do n't ask			1
try making the exchange / return without a receipt ( most stores will at least give store credit ) , or regift the item to someone you know is a better fit			0
from our readers share your gift return advice , and it could end up here later today .			0
