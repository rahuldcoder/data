@entity0 -- a court in central @entity0 this week found itself in the world 's spotlight , as a small army of celebrities staked their reputations by turning up to offer support -- and bail money -- to @entity11 founder @entity10			1
the 39 - year - old @entity12 , who handed himself over to @entity15 police last week to answer a @entity17 arrest warrant over alleged sex crimes in @entity19 , remains in custody pending an appeal by @entity19 authorities against a judge 's decision to grant him bail			1
@entity10 has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him , arguing that the charges against him are politically motivated and designed to deflect attention from the sensitive material exposed by his whistle - blowing website			1
@entity19 to appeal bail decision thursday this stance has won him some high - profile backing , as was shown during the hearing tuesday when some notable faces trooped into @entity38 determined to demonstrate their solidarity , even if it meant staking part of the £ 200,000 ( $ 315,000 ) bail or a spare room in your country mansion			1
despite having never personally met @entity10 , @entity46 , the veteran @entity15 director of movies including " @entity48 " and " @entity49 , " said he had offered £ 20,000 ( $ 31,444 ) towards his bail			1
" i think the work he has done has been a public service , " he told reporters , in quotes carried by @entity15 's @entity54 newspaper			1
" i think we are entitled to know the dealings of those that govern us			0
" @entity62 , @entity15 socialite and ex-wife of former @entity65 cricketer @entity64 , offered a similar amount before releasing the following statement : " i make no judgment of @entity10 as an individual as i have never met him			1
i am offering my support to him as i believe in the universal right to freedom of information and our right to be told the truth			0
" the daughter of the late financier and politician , @entity81 , @entity64 has also been active on @entity82 , and tweeted : " what happened to innocent until proven guilty ? he has n't even been charged , let alone convicted			0
" @entity10 also found prominent support from across the @entity85 , as controversial @entity87 filmmaker @entity86 pledged $ 20,000 from " his own pocket			1
" the director of thought - provoking documentaries such as " @entity91 , " which looked at @entity87 gun control in the wake of 1999 @entity95 massacre , wrote on his website that he would be offering the assistance of his website , servers , domain names and " anything else i can do to keep @entity11 alive and thriving as it continues its work to expose the crimes that were concocted in secret and carried out in our name and with our tax dollars			1
" he added : " we were taken to war in @entity109 on a lie			0
hundreds of thousands are now dead			0
just imagine if the men who planned this war crime back in 2002 had had a @entity11 to deal with			1
they might not have been able to pull it off			0
" meanwhile , @entity115 , the founder of @entity0 's @entity116 which claims to " champion independent journalism , " offered to accommodate @entity10 , who has no @entity15 address , at his sprawling family home in order to meet another of the bail conditions issued by the court tuesday			1
@entity10 would also be electronically tagged and required to report daily to a police station close by			1
in a statement on his website he explained that his support was being offered " on a point of principle			0
" he added : " in the face of a concerted attempt to shut him down and after a decade since 9/11 that has been characterized by manipulation of the media by the authorities , the information released by @entity11 is a refreshing glimpse into an increasingly opaque world			1
" i am suspicious of the personal charges that have been made against mr. @entity10 and hope that this will be properly resolved by the courts			1
certainly no credible charges have been brought regarding the leaking of the information itself			0
" other prominent supporters at the hearing included award - winning @entity12 journalist and documentary - maker @entity153 , @entity15 gay rights activist @entity154 , and human rights activist @entity152			2
@entity153 , a long - time critic of @entity87 foreign policy , has been particularly vocal in his support for @entity10 and the work of @entity11			1
however he questioned why @entity10 had reportedly been held in solitary confinement in @entity0 's largest prison			2
" he called me from @entity164 at the weekend and his state of mind seemed pretty good , " he told reporters , in quotes carried by @entity15 's @entity162			2
" he is in solitary confinement			0
he is in what is known as a punishment block and we are not quite sure why			0
he is an innocent man who has not been charged with anything , sitting in solitary confinement -- what is going on ? " @entity154 , meanwhile , also appeared outside the court on tuesday to express his support for the work of @entity11			2
he told reporters : " it 's quite clear that the @entity87 government and other governments have kept secrets hidden from us			0
and we the people have a right to know			0
these revelations are in the public interest			2
it 's shocking that it 's taken a whistleblower to bring them to our attention			0
" when asked about the allegations against him he replied : " no one can know			0
but he is innocent until proven guilty			0
" however in a post on his @entity82 page the previous week , he wrote : " @entity10 might be guilty of sex crimes			1
but the charges look like a fix to silence & discredit him			2
the @entity87 is out to destroy him			0
" in another post he claimed the @entity87 government tried to discredit @entity205 whistleblower @entity204 in the 1970s			2
@entity204 , a former military analyst , famously leaked the " @entity209 " in 1971 , a classified study into @entity87 decision - making during the conflict			0
@entity152 , human rights advocate and former wife of @entity213 singer @entity212 , also gave her support to @entity10 , telling reporters in central @entity0 that she was concerned that the case had become politicized			2
