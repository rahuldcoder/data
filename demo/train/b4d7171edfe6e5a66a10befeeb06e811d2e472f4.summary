curious about life on @entity2 ? @entity4 's rover curiosity has now given scientists the strongest evidence to date that the environment on the @entity2 could have supported life billions of years ago			1
since @entity3 made its rock star landing more than a year ago at @entity11 , the focal point of its mission , the roving laboratory has collected evidence that gives new insights into @entity2 ' past environment			1
@entity4 scientists announced in march that @entity2 could have once hosted life -- at least , in the distant past , based on the chemical analysis of powder collected from @entity3 's drill			1
an area of the crater known as @entity29 once hosted " slightly salty liquid water , " @entity23 , lead scientist for the @entity24 at @entity25 in @entity26 , said earlier this year			1
six new studies released monday by the journal @entity33 add more insights about these formerly habitable conditions and provide other new knowledge that increase our understanding of the @entity2			2
the results were also presented at the fall meeting of the @entity41 in @entity42			0
curiosity found evidence of clay formations , or " mudstone , " in @entity29 , scientists said monday			1
@entity2 mud is a big deal because this clay may have held the key ingredients for life billions of years ago			1
it means a lake must have existed in this area			0
" this is a game changer since these are the kind of materials that are very ' @entity63 - like ' and conducive for life , " said @entity56 , lead author of one of the new studies			1
this ancient environment , where the clay minerals formed , would have been favorable to microbes , @entity56 told @entity68			1
some bacteria on @entity63 called chemolithoautotrophs could have lived in that kind of environment			0
these bacteria derive their energy from breaking down rocks and sediments , @entity56 said , generally by oxidizing elements in the rock			0
@entity56 and colleagues also found hydrogen , oxygen , carbon , nitrogen , sulfur and phosphorus in the sedimentary rocks at @entity29 , elements that are all critical for life			1
the new findings mean the rover 's $ 2.5 billion mission is " turning the corner , " said @entity91 , a @entity92 planetary geologist and chief scientist for @entity3 , also known as the @entity95			1
@entity91 and colleagues found the habitable environment existed later in @entity2 history than previously thought			0
by studying physical characteristics of rock layers in and near @entity29 , they determined that @entity2 was habitable less than 4 billion years ago -- about the same time as the oldest signs we have for life on @entity63			1
the habitable conditions could have remained for millions to tens of millions of years , with rivers and lakes appearing and disappearing over time			1
curiosity also helped scientists figure out the age of an ancient @entity2 rock , as described in the new research			0
the rock is called @entity113 , and it now has the distinction of being the first whose age was measured on another planet through chemical analysis			0
the rover used a method for dating @entity63 rocks that measures the decay of an isotope of potassium as it slowly changes into argon			0
scientists determined the rock was between 3.86 billion and 4.56 billion years old			2
this age range is consistent with earlier estimates for rocks in @entity11			0
scientists say roughly 4 billion years ago , the environment on @entity2 was n't much different from that of modern - day @entity63			1
but things on @entity2 then took a drastic turn , and the planet was dramatically transformed from warm and wet to bitterly cold and dry , scientists say			0
in addition to the cold and dry conditions , scientists say the no. 1 reason life probably would n't have thrived on @entity2 is its extremely high levels of radiation			2
studies : martian atmosphere was destroyed long ago " the radiation environment on @entity2 is unlike anything we have on @entity63 , " said @entity143 , a biogeochemist and geologist at @entity4 's @entity146 and an author of one of the studies			2
" we do n't know if life on @entity2 could have ever adapted to the high levels of radiation the surface is currently experiencing			2
" @entity143 added , " this is a wide - open book , which we have barely started writing the pages of			0
" new radiation measurements will also be important to planning any human missions to @entity2 , scientists said			0
" our measurements also tie into @entity3 's investigations about habitability , " study co-author @entity162 of @entity163 in @entity164 , @entity165 , said in a statement			1
" the radiation sources that are concerns for human health also affect microbial survival as well as preservation of organic chemicals			0
" organic chemicals come from a variety of sources , including meteorites and comets , but they can also be indicative of life			2
what 's bad for us is bad for signs of life -- but these organic chemicals could still be hiding on @entity2 nonetheless			2
