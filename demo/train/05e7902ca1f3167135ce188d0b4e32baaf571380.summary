-- @entity1 , @entity2 , does n't lack for fashionable boutique hotels , but to the west , along the @entity5 , the options have tended to be as primal as the shoreline			1
recently , however , a group of properties has sprung up on the northern coast , aiming to seduce 21st - century travelers with designs steeped in @entity13			1
the @entity14 was built on the site of a fish - packing facility on the @entity17			1
each stop on this easy three - night itinerary provides a stylish @entity2 beach getaway -- along with postcard - worthy water views			1
day 1 : @entity1 to @entity22 follow the @entity23 ( @entity24 30 ) as it meanders along the waterway that led @entity26 to the sea			1
( for more shore - hugging river views , cross the @entity29 , just west of @entity30 , and drive on @entity32 's @entity31 -- but be sure to return to @entity33 by crossing back over at @entity34			2
) make your way to @entity22 , the oldest @entity24 settlement west of the @entity38 ( founded in 1811 ) , a revitalized former fishing town with @entity40 architecture and a restored 1913 riverfront trolley			2
take in the town -- and the mouth of the @entity17 -- from the 125 - foot @entity44 , and for a dramatic close - up of the @entity46 , which connects @entity2 and @entity32 , check in to the @entity14 ( doubles from $ 299 )			1
built on the site of a fish - packing facility on a pier that extends 600 feet into the river , the four - year - old hotel embraces a @entity54 version of loft architecture , with exposed steel beams in the atrium - style lobby and hardwood floors in the 46 balconied rooms			2
the best place to eat is just a short stroll down the pier at the @entity64 ( dinner for two $ 75 ; 503 / 325 - 6777 )			2
the restaurant offers exceptional views of the river and bridge , a tasting room for the @entity72 's @entity71 , and a small - plates menu featuring watermelon - and - feta salad and a savory cheesecake with dungeness crab			0
day 2 : @entity22 to arch @entity77 the @entity78 ( @entity24 26 ) crosses @entity79 and snakes southward almost to arch @entity77 , set in the lush green terrain of @entity82			1
it 's a 30 - mile trip that passes through the monied enclave of @entity85 , as well as @entity86 , one of the first beach resorts in @entity2			1
@entity0 : 45 best new hotels of 2009 be sure to explore the @entity90 art colony , comprising 19 galleries and crafts studios ; then hit the sand to behold @entity94 , a 235 - foot - tall basalt formation that 's the third - largest such ocean monolith in the world			2
you might also want to scope out a spot for dinner in @entity90 -- locals love the @entity103 - @entity102 dishes such as pesto - and - prawn pasta at @entity105 at 988 ( dinner for two $ 110 , 503 / 436 - 1151 ) -- or stock up on @entity2 wine and @entity109 cheese before heading to arch @entity77 , a tiny residential community with no restaurants			1
it is here that @entity113 transformed an old beach house into the @entity116 ( doubles from $ 275 )			1
the three handsome suites , with mod furnishings , are perfect for curling up in when the rain lashes the wild surf			0
in fair weather , guests mingle on the oceanfront deck to watch gray whales or gaze at the stars			0
in the morning , a hearty breakfast with fresh pastries provides fortification for beachcombing			0
nestled between two state parks , the inn offers direct access to a nearly deserted @entity5 stretch with sand dollar - filled tide pools			0
day 3 : arch @entity77 to @entity135 @entity135 is a straight 79 - mile shot down the 101 , past open stretches of sand with more clumps of beach grass than sunbathers			1
along the way : @entity143 , in @entity142 , is a charming shopping strip ; the @entity144 ( 503 / 355 - 8500 ) , in @entity145 , has 97 flavors of salt - water taffy ; @entity148 ( 503 / 322 - 3312 ) will hook you up for crab hunting and clam digging ; and the @entity152 ( 503 / 392 - 3838 ) , in @entity153 , serves fresh seafood and a popular wood - fired pizza			0
@entity109 is the home of the famous cheddar , as well as ice creams made from local berries			0
past @entity135 , in @entity161 , is a worthwhile detour : the @entity163 , dating from 1871			0
the beachfront at @entity135 is stacked with condo - by - the - sea complexes which makes the recent renovation of the 141 - room @entity167 ( doubles from $ 134 ) that much more welcome			0
under the new management of the owners of the hip @entity173 hotel , in @entity174 , the @entity175 -- first opened in 1936 -- is now decorated with cork bulletin - board walls and jazzy striped daybeds			0
the balconied guest rooms reference midcentury modern design with sleek built - ins and bold orange accents			0
you 'd swear you were sleeping in an urban boutique hotel , except the roar outside your door is waves , not traffic			0
