as a former football player with both an imposing physique and personality , few people have felt comfortable calling " @entity5 " @entity5 by his birth name , @entity7			1
even @entity5 is short for a family nickname that hardly seemed fitting for one of hip - hop 's most feared impresarios : " @entity5			1
" being known as big and cuddly is not how @entity5 rose to fame			1
instead he is best known for helping promote @entity15 rap in a field that had long been dominated by @entity18 artists -- and elevating an @entity18 / @entity15 hip - hop feud to a level that many still hold accountable for the deaths of two of the genre 's biggest stars			2
how the co-founder of @entity27 -- who is being held in connection with one 's man death in an alleged purposeful hit - and - run -- came to be considered such a tough guy is equal parts legend and rap sheet			0
born in @entity38 , @entity39 , as the youngest of three children and the only son , @entity5 had sports ability and size , earning a football scholarship to the @entity43 , @entity44			1
his former coach told the @entity46 in 1996 that @entity5 was a good kid			1
" he was n't a problem guy at all , " said @entity47 , who was school 's head coach in 1986 when @entity5 played there and who later went to work for the @entity51			1
" you did n't really see that street roughness about him			0
" @entity5 briefly played as a defensive lineman for the @entity56 before becoming a bodyguard for singer @entity58			1
that gig did n't last long but helped give him a larger glimpse into the music industry			0
being from @entity38 , @entity5 had for years been friends with fellow native @entity63 , a member of the controversial rap group @entity64 hard - core songs include " @entity66 , " which helped form the basis for what became known as " gangsta rap			1
" the oft - repeated tale is that to get @entity63 released from his contract with @entity72 owned by fellow @entity64 member @entity73 , @entity5 appeared at the label 's offices with a group of men armed with pipes and baseball bats			1
" i know you 've heard all the stories , " @entity5 told a @entity81 writer in 1996 about the incident			1
" but you have to realize one thing : results			2
" @entity63 was eventually released from his contract and became @entity5 's flagship artist when he co-founded @entity27 in 1991			1
another infamous story had @entity5 dangling rapper @entity90 over a balcony to get the latter to share the profits from his hit song " @entity95			1
" the rapper , whose legal name is @entity90 , has since said the incident has been exaggerated			0
" i went to my hotel room and @entity5 was in there with several people , " @entity90 said during a 1999 @entity101 " episode about his career			1
" he let me know he wanted to get some points off the record ' @entity95			0
' @entity5 took me out on the balcony , started talking to me personally			1
he had me look over the edge , showing me how high i was up there			0
i needed to wear a diaper that day			0
i was an ' investor ' in @entity27 with no return on my money			0
" the rapper added , " he did n't hang me off from any balcony , okay			0
the story 's been kind of blown out of proportion and i want to clarify that @entity5 and i have no bad feelings towards each other			1
" @entity5 's roster of artists included several who were no strangers to violence and run - ins with the law , including @entity125 ( later known as @entity125 and @entity125 ) and @entity126			1
in 1994 @entity126 accused producer @entity128 and rapper @entity129 " @entity130 with being involved in an incident at a @entity133 studio in 1994 in which @entity126 was shot			0
both @entity134 ( who over the years has also been known as " @entity128 , " @entity128 " and " @entity128 " ) and @entity130 denied the accusations			0
but the tensions intensified in 1995 after @entity5 gave a speech at the @entity146 , where he said , " any artist out there that want to be an artist and stay a star , and do n't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos , all on the record , dancing ... come to @entity27 ! " many took the comments as a direct dig at @entity134 , who often appeared in his artists ' music videos			1
the following month @entity152 , a @entity27 employee , was killed during a late - night party in @entity154 in which both @entity5 and @entity134 were present with their entourages			1
those from @entity5 's camp blamed @entity134 ' bodyguard , and the death brought public visibility to what was known as the @entity18 / @entity15 rap war			2
@entity5 was driving the car in which @entity126 was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in @entity44 in 1996			2
the following year @entity130 was shot to death while riding in a caravan in @entity169 that included his friend and mentor @entity128			0
there was speculation that both of the deaths were tied to the feud , though the slayings remain unsolved			0
in 1996 , @entity5 was sent to prison for almost five years for assaulting a man in a @entity44 hotel on the night @entity126 was killed			2
in 2002 , he was jailed for violating his probation by associating with known gang members and again the following year for punching a parking attendant outside a @entity185 nightclub			0
in 2005 , @entity5 was shot in the right leg at a party in @entity188 held in honor of @entity191 's planned appearance before the @entity192			2
history repeated itself in august 2014 when @entity5 was shot six times at another @entity196 party , this one hosted by singer @entity197			2
in october , @entity5 and comedian @entity198 were arrested for allegedly stealing a photographer 's camera			2
his legal issues and the departure of many of his top acts resulted in @entity5 's label filing for bankruptcy in 2006			2
in an interview with @entity208 in 2013 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of @entity125 's debut album , " @entity211 , " @entity5 portrayed his label as a trailblazer			2
" @entity27 was n't only a black - owned record label , @entity27 was pretty much the only @entity216 - owned record label , " he said			0
" everything else was either @entity218 or some other thing			0
" it became the blueprint for any label that 's out , including the majors , " he said			0
" i was the first person doing 360 - degree deals with all the artists ; the majors would tell the artists , ' it 's the worst piece of s * * t deal in the world , do n't go for it			0
' and now they 're doing it			0
