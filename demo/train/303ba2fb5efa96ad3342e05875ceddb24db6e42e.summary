@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 elders will decide whether any @entity6 military who stay in the country after 2014 will be granted immunity from prosecution , president @entity3 told reporters monday in his palace			1
" the issue of granting immunity to @entity6 soldiers is not a decision that could be made by @entity1 government			2
this is a decision that the @entity1 people can make , " he said			2
" this is a decision that should be made by the @entity1 people in a @entity24 : whether they are granting immunity to them or not ; if yes , how and under what conditions			1
" a @entity24 is a gathering of elders and peoples ' representatives			1
@entity3 was referring to a comment made last week during his meeting in @entity34 with @entity6 president @entity35 , who told him that the continued presence of any @entity6 troops in @entity1 after the planned withdrawal of @entity40 forces in 2014 would depend on their being granted immunity from prosecution by @entity1 courts			1
" the @entity6 already has arrangements like this with countries all around the world , and nowhere does the @entity6 have any kind of security agreement with a country without immunity for our troops , " @entity35 said			2
but there is little doubt about what decision the @entity24 will reach , @entity3 said sunday in an interview with @entity2 's @entity58			1
" i can tell you with relatively good confidence that they will say , ' all right , let 's do it , ' " @entity3 predicted			2
" i could argue for it , i could sell it , and i 'm sure they would understand			0
" @entity3 said there was little chance the @entity6 would remove all of its troops from @entity1 after the pullout is completed at the end of 2014			1
" the @entity6 will continue to have the use of facilities in @entity1 and , in order to run those facilities well for the purposes of continuing to fight @entity77 and train and equip @entity1 forces , the @entity6 will need to have a limited number of forces in @entity1			0
" how many will remain is a decision that rests with @entity6 officials , he said			0
but he predicted that domestic forces would prove capable of handling the responsibility			0
" we have to provide for our own security ; we have to provide for our own bread and butter , and i 'm sure we are able and the @entity1 people are willing overwhelmingly to do that			1
" already , he said , stability has improved in areas vacated by departing international forces			0
@entity3 also said that @entity1 has turned the corner in terms of battling the @entity97			1
he predicted @entity99 fundamentalists will not regain the strength to enforce their radical agenda , which has included the closing of girls ' schools and the subjugation of women			0
" i think there is now a critical mass in @entity1 of the educated , of the @entity1 people who want a future of progress and stability			0
and i think , also , that the @entity97 have recognized that the corner has been turned			0
" @entity2 's @entity113 contributed to this report			0

the @entity24 , a gathering of elders , will decide on immunity , @entity1 president @entity3 says
@entity3 says he thinks the @entity24 " is always reasonable " and will grant immunity
@entity3 says he is confident that @entity1 troops can provide security after @entity40 leaves
