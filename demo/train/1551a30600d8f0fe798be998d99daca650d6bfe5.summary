-- google search is about to get way more personal			2
in a change that 's been called the " most radical transformation ever " to @entity7 's search engine , the @entity3 , @entity4 , company on tuesday announced an update called " search , plus @entity17 , " which causes @entity7 's robots to incorporate data from its social network as well as the public internet when delivering search results to people			1
" search is pretty amazing at finding that one needle in a haystack of billions of web pages , images , videos , news and much more , " @entity7 said in a blog post on tuesday morning			0
" but clearly , that is n't enough			0
you should also be able to find your own stuff on the @entity28 , the people you know and things they 've shared with you , as well as the people you do n't know but might want to ... all from one search box			0
" the company added : " search is simply better with your world in it			0
" on the prominent blog @entity37 , @entity38 writes that the updates fundamentally change the way @entity7 's search engine functions , calling it the " most radical " change ever			1
" the new system will perhaps make life much easier for some people , allowing them to find both privately shared content from friends and family plus material from across the web through a single search , rather than having to search twice using two different systems , " he writes			0
" however , @entity54 may cause some privacy worries , as private content may appear as if it is exposed publicly ( it is not )			0
it might also cause concern by making private content more visible to friends and family than those sharing may have initially intended			0
" on the blog @entity63 , @entity62 gives an example search to help explain the changes			0
say you were to @entity7 " @entity68 , " he writes			0
" for most people , this would probably pull up links to the books , the films , and a variety of fan sites			0
for this intrepid reporter , though , the results would also include my @entity79 album shot at a @entity68 premiere a few years back ( and labeled as such )			0
these images would pop up both in the main search results page , and in @entity84 results			1
likewise , any blog posts my friends had shared on @entity87 about the boy wizard would show up in my results , too			0
" it 's worth noting that @entity7 users who do n't like these new personal results can turn them off			2
a toggle switch that controls personal results should appear in the upper right corner of a search results page , the company says			1
click " no personal results " to avoid seeing the social content			2
the social search results started rolling out on tuesday but may not be visible to all users			1
@entity7 says the social search applies , for now , only to people who are signed in to @entity104 and are searching in @entity105			2
the update causes @entity7 to surface material that is specifically related to the person who is searching			0
so my search results wo n't be the same as yours , if i 'm signed in to @entity7			1
things my friends have posted on @entity87 and @entity79 will show up in the results as well , as long as they have entered caption info about their photos			2
@entity87 profile and topic pages also will get better play in search results after the change			1
@entity122 , a senior writer at @entity123 , which is a @entity0 partner website , says the change has the bonus effect for @entity7 of giving lots and lots of exposure to its social network , @entity87 , which is aimed to be a direct competitor to @entity131			1
" the change will expose @entity87 profiles , as well as posts and photographs uploaded to the network , to hundreds of millions of search users whether or not they have @entity87 accounts			1
in many cases , the changes will push content from other sites , including @entity131 , further down on the search results pages , " he writes on @entity123			1
@entity122 adds that social search has long been a " holy grail " in tech. " @entity131 has been working with @entity147 to allow that company 's search engine , @entity150 , to surface more personalized content , " he writes			1
" and the @entity131 platform has allowed countless services , like @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , to become more personal by showing users content that is relevant to their @entity131 friends			2
" but the change is also likely to upset competitors who complain that @entity7 gives preferential treatment to content from its own products -- from @entity87 to @entity164 , he writes .			1

@entity7 adds social , personal content to its search results
