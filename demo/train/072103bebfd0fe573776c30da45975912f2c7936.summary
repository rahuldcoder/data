-- of all things to steal , you 'd think love letters would be low on the list			1
but that 's exactly what thieves took from @entity8 and @entity9 -- the couple 's sweet letters and the sleeping memories they stirred			1
" we were just overwhelmed ... so sad , " said @entity9 , 88 , about the day they discovered them missing			1
still , she and @entity8 , 89 , were never the type for self - pity			1
what could they do ? they moved on			2
then , several decades later , the @entity20 got a strange message on their answering machine			2
the caller , a military veteran , had painstakingly tracked them down after his father 's death			1
he said he had news about their letters			1
" we thought , ' oh , it must be a mistake , ' " @entity9 said			1
in love and war @entity8 and @entity9 met at a @entity35 high school in the 1940s , when @entity37 was big , a stamp cost 3 cents , and war raged around the world			1
for their first date , @entity8 took @entity9 to a dance at a civic center			1
he told his family that night he 'd found his girl			2
@entity9 took some convincing , but @entity8 's persistence paid off			1
" i think that the war situation was so intense at that time , " she said			2
" it was just important for him to find a girlfriend and for me to find a boyfriend			2
that 's what we were , girl - and boyfriend			1
" they married on december 31 , 1942 , just about a year after the attack on @entity59 that drew the @entity60 into @entity61 had joined the @entity62 by that point , and had to get a weekend pass for the wedding			1
they were madly in love and eager to start their new life , but the war had plans of its own			2
after the wedding , the @entity72 sent @entity8 to @entity74 for aircraft mechanic training , then back to @entity35 and on to @entity76 before he deployed to @entity77 , where @entity9 could not follow			1
to stay connected , the newlyweds wrote each other as often as they could -- open , affectionate letters describing how much they missed each other and longed to be together			1
" @entity82 , i can hear @entity84 ( @entity37 ) singing over the loudspeaker , " wrote @entity8 on july 6 , 1944			1
" he is singing ' @entity86			0
' boy , he can really sing			0
@entity9 , remember the old moon down in @entity74 ... " that moon means more than ever to me now			1
just right when i got into my foxhole , i could look out and see that old moon shining so very bright			0
it was so very full			0
i got a very warm feeling inside of me just sitting there , laying there , and looking at it , and thinking of you			0
" @entity8 later explained the motif of the moon : " we had made a commitment when we left that we 'd kiss the moon at night			1
" " if you think about it ... the moon , wherever you 're at , the other party will see that same moon that day , " he said			0
" that moon would be over her			0
" the couple made other promises too			1
before @entity8 left , he and @entity9 bought identical maps of @entity77			1
in his letters , @entity8 wrote the position on his map that matched , more or less , where he was			1
the censors never cracked their code			0
@entity8 was deployed overseas for 27 months			1
he served in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , arriving in @entity121 just 12 days after the historic invasion			0
after the war , he returned to @entity35			0
he and @entity9 made a life in @entity125 , outside @entity126 , where they raised four children			1
the @entity129 locked their love letters in a trunk for safekeeping , along with the rest of @entity8 's war memorabilia			1
they put the trunk in a shed			0
but sometime in the late 1960s , or early 1970s -- the @entity20 are n't sure -- someone gutted their shed , snatching the trunk and everything in it			0
" we just accepted that they were gone forever , probably trashed			0
we never dreamed we 'd ever see them , " @entity9 said			1
" and when we had this message from this young man on the phone we just could n't believe it			0
" a mystery man the man at the other end of the line had a plan when he dialed the @entity20 ' phone last fall			1
using @entity72 serial number , he had tracked the couple down			1
apparently , there had been a number of men with the name @entity156 in the service			0
but there was just one with a wife named @entity9			1
he asked the @entity20 to meet at a nearby @entity161			0
it was about 12:30 in the afternoon when they pulled into the parking lot			0
" he undoubtedly saw two old , gray - haired people walk right in , and got out of his car and walked over and said : ' are you @entity156 ? ' " @entity8 said			1
" handed me this big box he had of our letters			2
" the man told the @entity20 he had come across their correspondence as he was going through his father 's things			2
his father , a stamp collector , had died			0
maybe his father bought the letters , hoping their stamps would be worth something one day			2
but who knows ? the man was n't saying much , and the @entity20 did n't want to pry			0
" i do n't want to put him through that , " @entity8 said			1
" he just did something that was a marvelous thing for him to do			0
" as quickly as he entered the @entity129 ' lives , the man left			0
they tried to buy his lunch			0
but he would n't take a thing			0
later , they sent the man a box of candy for @entity196 anyway			0
" he 'd been a veteran himself , and he had a boy that had been in either @entity200 or @entity201 and had just returned home			0
so he knew what letters meant to him , his family -- the same thing , " @entity8 said			1
" he just thought ... they were n't his , and he wanted to get them back to where they belong			0
" ' sweetheart , all my life is yours ' the letters are written in tiny print , many on thin onion skin paper			2
most have upside down stamps , which was the @entity129 ' way of saying : " i love you			0
" they got back 241 letters , which they say is just a fraction of the many hundreds they sent each other over the years			1
as they read through their letters , they often have to stop on account of tears , both happy and sad			2
reading one out loud , @entity9 's voice broke			1
the emotion was raw , as if she was reading the letter for the first time and still waiting and worrying for a husband in harm 's way			2
" they 're pretty difficult for us to read			0
it just brings back all the agony , and the worry , and the concern , " she said			0
though some letters were serious , others were playful			2
the @entity129 poked gentle fun at themselves and each other , and imagined what they were going to do when the war was over			0
they shared the sort of small details that make up a life			0
" guess what we 're going to have for supper ! " @entity9 wrote in a letter dated december 8 , 1944			1
" it 's really going to be a treat because we have n't had any for so long			2
we 're going to have bacon ! boy , now that 's really something in this neck of the woods			2
... pork is a luxury these days			0
" though times were tough and being separated was hard , @entity8 said he and @entity9 never really wrote about their problems			1
" that would just burden the other party , " he said			0
" we were always trying to give the best that we had			0
" @entity277 from her december 8 , 1944 , letter , @entity9 hints at the other reason why @entity8 said they initially kept their letters under lock and key -- to keep their children 's prying eyes out of their most private exchanges : " @entity82 , i love you more every day			1
it seems as if i 'm wanting your caresses more and more , and i 'm wanting your kisses more ... i 'm wanting you more and more			0
sweetheart , all my life is yours			0
" her promise proved true			0
surrounded by family and friends , the @entity20 celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in december , shortly after they were reunited with their letters			1
where the rest are is anyone 's guess , but they are grateful they got back what they did			2
" it 's bringing back all the memories			2
but it ca n't draw the two of us any closer than we are , " @entity8 said			1
" we 've been up and down life -- been to the top of it and down to the bottom			0
we 're just a couple determined to make the best out of our lives			2

@entity8 and @entity9 married in december 1942 , a year after the @entity60 joined @entity317
