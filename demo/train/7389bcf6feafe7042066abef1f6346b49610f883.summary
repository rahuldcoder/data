@entity0 , @entity1 -- more than any single soccer player , the fans took center stage during the @entity6			1
during the summer , each team 's devotees donned their country 's colors , painted their faces , shouted their songs , rejoiced in their victories and cried bitter tears of defeat			0
" whether you 're in a host city or back at home watching it on tv ... it captures you , " said @entity16 , a lifelong fan of @entity18 football			1
" i just love the passion			2
" @entity16 has made it his mission to turn that fan fervor into something more			1
his @entity31 - based nonprofit , @entity30 , mobilizes soccer fans to volunteer in cities hosting the @entity6 and other major tournaments			1
" we do football tours with a difference , " said @entity16 , 48			1
" they get to watch games , drink beer in a bar ... but for a huge chunk of our time , we go out to people in need			0
" it 's an idea that struck @entity16 nearly 10 years ago , while sitting in a packed stadium during a game			1
" i suddenly saw all the fans around me and ... it was like an untapped army , " he said			2
" and i started asking myself , ' what could i do if we could mobilize some of these people to do some good ? ' " since 2006 , @entity16 ' group has enlisted more than 500 volunteers to work on construction projects , educational programs and soccer clinics that have helped nearly 6,000 children			1
" @entity60 's always had the ability to break down barriers , " he said			0
" we 're taking it a step further			2
" giving back in @entity1 in june , @entity16 and his team brought almost 300 volunteers to @entity0 , one of the 12 host cities for this year 's @entity6			1
the group 's main project was constructing an education complex for @entity72 , an after - school program that serves children from poor areas just outside the city center			1
@entity77 , one of the program 's founders , could not believe it when @entity16 offered in 2012 to help his organization			1
" to come and to do this for us , for the children ... it is still a dream , you know ? " he said			0
" this is the @entity6 spirit			1
" the facility -- where academic tutoring , soccer instruction , art and music classes will be provided to more than 500 at - risk youth -- should be up and running by the end of the year			2
@entity16 and his volunteers will return there to teach @entity18 and coach soccer for years to come			1
" when we invest in a place , it 's not for a project			0
it 's for the long - term , " @entity16 said			1
" @entity105 is just the first step into a country			0
it 's a launchpad for us			0
" like many countries that have hosted major sporting events , @entity1 has seen protests during the past year about the estimated $ 11 billion spent on projects that have not necessarily improved the country 's public services			1
while @entity16 makes a point to avoid politics , he believes his work helps communities that have not benefited economically from the games			1
" we try to create opportunities for the local people , " @entity16 said			1
" we 're not here to save anybody or solve anything			2
we 're here to do our bit			2
" igniting a passion while @entity16 wants to assist those in need , he 's also hoping that giving back sparks something deeper within his volunteers , many of whom have never done anything like this before			1
volunteers from 12 countries came to @entity1 to work with @entity30 ; most are from the @entity31 , @entity141 , @entity142 and the @entity143			1
@entity16 finds that a shared love of soccer gives them an instant bond that gets stronger as they work toward a common goal			1
" within a couple days , they 're just part of a team			2
and it 's a tight team			0
there 's a lot of fun , a lot of joking , and guys become friends for life , " he said			0
@entity161 , 27 , had never volunteered before participating with @entity30 in @entity1			1
the @entity163 - born soccer coach , who now lives in @entity164 , spent eight days working with the group			0
" it 's just a brilliant feeling , " @entity161 said			0
" me and some friends who are volunteering here actually plan on coming back once the project is finished to see it in all its glory			0
" @entity173 , 48 , helped build an orphanage with the group in @entity176 during the @entity177			0
this time , he brought his 20 - year - old son along			0
" when i came back from @entity176 , he saw the difference that it made to me , " @entity173 said			0
" that 's why he wanted to come , too			0
" @entity173 and his son had such a good experience that @entity173 now plans to bring his wife and daughter on the next @entity30 trip in @entity141 in 2016			0
for @entity16 , that 's the whole idea			2
" lots of guys come and kind of get it in their blood , " @entity16 said			2
" that 's what we 're about			0
... and that is a movement			0
" " we 're trying to harness the passion of football fans to make a difference			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity30 websites and see how to help : @entity31 @entity143			0
