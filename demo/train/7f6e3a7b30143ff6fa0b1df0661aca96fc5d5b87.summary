-- the weekend 's battle between two big - budget science fiction adventures was n't quite as close as expected			1
@entity9 's " @entity8 " scored a solid win , with the tale of a boy and his inflatable robot ringing up an estimated $ 56.2 million in ticket sales			1
ads for the movie played up the connection to the studio 's recent hits , including " @entity15 " and especially " @entity16			1
" the @entity18 space epic " @entity19 " could n't keep pace , bringing in an estimated $ 50 million -- and most observers think that number is more likely to fall than to rise when final numbers are released monday afternoon			1
@entity24 stars as the pilot of a space expedition which leaves a dying @entity27 to search for a new home for humanity			2
how good is ' @entity19 ' ? if the " @entity19 " total holds , it 'll be just the fourth time that two films debuted with $ 50 million or more in the same weekend			1
each time that 's happened , the animated film beat the live - action effort : " @entity35 " won out over " @entity36 " in 2008 ; " @entity37 " beat " @entity38 " in 2012 ; and " @entity39 " surpassed " @entity40 " in 2013			1
@entity42 number - crunchers will have a field day with this weekend 's data : how did the extra money from @entity47 tickets for " @entity19 " compare with the premium on 3d tickets for " @entity8 " ? and what about the discounted child tickets for the @entity53 flick ? there 's also the fact that " interstellar " is a full hour longer -- so did that mean more showings for " hero , " leading to more tickets sold ? one set of stats sums it up : " hero " opened in 200 more theaters , but still averaged nearly $ 1,000 more per theater			1
in short , more people simply wanted to see " @entity8			2
" moviegoers also still want to see " @entity68 " as well			0
the drama starring @entity70 continues to have a long box office tail , staying in the @entity72 in its sixth weekend and closing in on $ 150 million in domestic grosses			0
in limited release , " @entity76 , " starring @entity78 favorite @entity77 as @entity79 , opened very strong : an estimated $ 206,000 in just five theaters			0
with " @entity80 " and " @entity81 " the only new wide releases next weekend , it 's likely " hero " and " @entity19 " each will have one more shot at no. 1 ; then " @entity88 : @entity93 1 " figures to blow everyone else out of the water when it opens on november 21			2
here are the weekend domestic box office estimates from @entity95 , with final numbers available monday afternoon : 1			0
" @entity8 " -- $ 56.2 million 2			2
" interstellar " -- $ 50 million 3			0
" @entity68 " -- $ 6.1 million ( $ 145.4 million total ) 4			0
" @entity99 " -- $ 6 million ( $ 43.5 million total ) 5			0
" @entity100 " -- $ 5.7 million ( $ 27.4 million total )			0

" @entity8 " ads played up connection to " @entity15 " and " @entity16 "
" @entity19 " had a *ton* of *pre-release* hype , but could n't match " @entity107 "
when live - action and animated films debut head - to - head , animation usually wins
