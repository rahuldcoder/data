@entity0 -- rep. @entity3 's goal is to thwart @entity5 radicalization , but some people fear his hearings could have exactly the opposite effect			1
some counterterrorism experts believe shining a harsh spotlight on the @entity11 could play into the jihadist narrative that the @entity13 is at war with @entity5 and encourage more people to participate in terrorist activity			1
@entity17 , executive director of the @entity18 , says @entity3 is unfair if he blames the entire @entity5 community for the actions of a few			1
" i think his approach is going to radicalize young people , " says @entity17			2
@entity3 -- a @entity24 @entity23 -- says he is holding the hearings because the @entity5 community has not cooperated sufficiently with law enforcement			1
on wednesday , attorney general @entity28 contradicted that			2
" tips we have received , information that has been shared has been critical to our efforts to disrupting plots			2
he characterizes @entity24 as the " epicenter " of terrorist activity and says he is unaware of any good information coming from the @entity5 community to police in the city or surrounding counties			1
a recent study from the @entity42 said tips from the @entity11 thwarted 48 out of 120 terrorism cases involving @entity45 , though some experts say the data may not be complete			1
law enforcement officials say the @entity5 community is key to finding and disrupting terrorist plots , but the degree of cooperation varies from community to community and mosque to mosque			1
asked whether @entity3 's hearings might have a negative impact on the outreach efforts of the @entity59 and other law enforcement , @entity28 responded indirectly , saying , " we do n't want to stigmatize			2
we do n't want to alienate entire communities			2
" " we need to focus on individuals or groups of individuals who might band together and who would try to harm @entity68 ' interests or @entity68 citizens			2
that 's what this department is doing			0
" @entity3 's retort : " i do n't want to demonize anyone , either			0
but talk to [ deputy national security director @entity75			0
he said @entity76 is attempting to radicalize the @entity77			0
so if we are going to look for radicalization from @entity76 , where else would we look ? " some @entity80 said they believe @entity3 's approach could backfire and diminish cooperation			1
" i do n't know if representative @entity3 realizes it , but that 's the real danger to all of this , " says @entity83			0
@entity83 , a @entity5 convert , worships at the @entity87 in northern @entity88			1
the imam at the mosque said he has made a video that attempts to counter the jihadist message , and he has cooperated with the @entity59 and local police			1
@entity94 says the upcoming hearing will not change his stance			1
" human life is sacred , no matter who that person is			0
and therefore committing an act of terrorism or taking innocent life is a sin			0
" @entity94 says @entity3 is wrong to say the @entity5 community has not done enough to counter radicalization , and he fears the hearings could result in further isolation			1
that worries 25 - year old @entity110 as well			0
she worships at the mosque			0
" i can certainly see @entity80 becoming more introverted , and you definitely do n't want introversion when it comes to issues of radicalization			1
you want people to be communicative and receptive and open to opinions and ideas , " she says			0
there is no easy way to spot someone who has been radicalized			0
the @entity80 who have been arrested in connection with domestic terror plots have varied in age , education and sex			0
some are converts , others are lifelong @entity80			0
some were born overseas , others in the @entity68 there is no one path to radicalization that would allow for easy detection			2
@entity137 of the @entity42 has looked at individuals who have been radicalized and says some of them were ideologically committed and were looking for opportunities to engage in violence			0
@entity137 says other individuals simply may have fallen into terrorist activities by accident			2
he adds , " then there were others who seem to have been hangers - on , for lack of a better word			0
" @entity149 of @entity150 has studied radicalization			2
he says one of the most important things the @entity3 hearings could produce is a commitment to better understand how radicalization occurs , who is susceptible and how the jihadist message can be neutralized			1
" we do n't have a full honest - to - goodness , methodological approach that is empirically sound yet , " @entity149 says			0
@entity149 is not alone in thinking the hearings could have a positive impact			0
other experts agree they have to the potential to build understanding			1
but , they warn , the tone as well as the substance will be key .			1
