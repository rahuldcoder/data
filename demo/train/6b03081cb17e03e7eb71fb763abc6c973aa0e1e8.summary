he has faced menacing bouncers and even once had to duck a glass of milk propelled at pace from his father 's hands , but it was an encounter with a different aggressor that proved cricketer @entity13 's most frightening opponent			1
the mercurial all - rounder had been in the form of his life at the @entity17 , helping @entity18 win their first title in almost three decades when they beat @entity22 by six wickets in the final at @entity26 's @entity25			1
@entity13 had particular cause to celebrate after putting in a series of match - winning performances -- his tally of 362 runs and 15 wickets in nine matches earned him the " @entity35 " award			1
" everything came together at the @entity37 and it was something really special			1
and just being together as a team , lifting the @entity37 was a dream come true , " @entity13 told @entity1 's @entity41 series			1
but as each new chapter in that @entity46 sporting fairy tale was being written a more sinister narrative was unfolding deep inside @entity13 's body			1
" i was coughing a lot			2
i was not able to breathe on my left side			2
i was struggling to breathe throughout the whole tournament ( and ) spitting a little bit of blood at times during games , " he recalls			2
after the @entity37 he went for a scan that revealed a tumor in his chest cavity , but a combination of denial and disbelief saw him carry on pretty much as normal			1
" even when i was diagnosed , i kept ignoring it because i still wanted to play and i did n't believe it could happen to an athlete like me who had been training and keeps himself fit			2
" so off he went on tour to @entity66 that summer and in november he played two test matches at home against the @entity69			2
it was only the following january , when results of further tests confirmed the tumor was malignant -- a germ cell cancer called a mediastinal seminoma was diagnosed -- that @entity13 was forced to face his worst fears and seek treatment			1
" it was located between my heart and my ( left ) lung and it grew about 14 centimeters like a ball over my chest which was a concern			0
" @entity13 sought the expertise of @entity85 , a @entity86 doctor who had successfully treated cyclist , @entity87 for testicular cancer in the 1990s , and underwent chemotherapy at the @entity91 @entity90 in @entity92 in early 2012			1
" i had three sessions of chemotherapy so it was really tough , it was hard to go through it			0
but while i was going through my treatment , i was always motivated that i was going to come back and play for @entity18			1
i think that 's what kept me going and got me through			0
" @entity13 had enjoyed a stellar career up to then , playing @entity102 , one - day international and @entity105 cricket for @entity18 , making his senior debut in 2000 at the age of 19			1
a sparkling 84 off 80 balls in his first innings in a one - day match against @entity111 served notice of his talent , and it was in limited overs cricket that he was most at home on the international stage			2
the left - hander has fluently notched more than 8,000 one - day runs , which have included 13 hundreds and 51 half - centuries , and when he 's on his game his assaults on opposition bowling attacks have displayed a brutal beauty			2
it was four years before his heroics with bat and ball in 2011 that @entity13 had made himself a household name , smashing six sixes in an over off @entity66 paceman , @entity131 during the inaugural @entity132			1
previously only @entity133 had recorded such a feat in international cricket			0
" i would say it 's one of the biggest highlights of my career because wherever i go and whenever i speak to people or my friends , they always mention they remember you hitting six sixes			2
it 's a very special moment in my cricketing career			0
" unlike a lot of kids growing up in @entity18 , where cricket is the national game , @entity13 did n't care much for the sport preferring to play tennis and go roller skating during his early childhood in @entity154 , a small town five hours north of @entity155			1
but his father , @entity156 , who had represented @entity18 at cricket in the early 1980s , had other ideas and was hell - bent on seeing his son following in his footsteps			1
" my father was an international player but he did n't play much , so he wanted to continue his dream through me			0
he pushed me a lot into cricket and i eventually started liking it and i think i was destined to play			0
" the intense parental expectation of the elder @entity13 is laid bare in @entity13 's autobiography			1
writing in " @entity166 of my life , " @entity13 recalls an incident when his father exploded with rage after hearing that his son had been dismissed in a practice match			1
" i was once out for 39 , hitting the ball in the air and @entity175 got to hear about the dismissal			0
that evening he went back home and told @entity179 , ' @entity180 not to enter the house or i will kill him ' , " @entity13 wrote in the book published in 2013			1
after spending the night in his car , @entity13 returned to the house the next morning when his father had gone out			1
but then he unexpectedly came back			0
" without warning , he picked up the glass full of milk on the table and threw it straight at me			0
it missed my head and broke the glass pane of the window behind where i was sitting			0
then i received the full volley of his abuse			0
" his father has had to deal with his own cancer diagnosis in recent months -- reportedly undergoing treatment for cancer of the vocal chords last year -- but happily @entity13 remains clear of the disease			1
his wish to represent his country again was granted when he returned to play in three tests against @entity66 at the end of 2012 and a string of one - day and t20 international appearances followed in 2013 and last year			1
but , as he 's first to admit , his form has been patchy since recovering from cancer			2
" i 've had a little bit of up and down in the last two to three years and that was bound to happen and i 've taken that in my stride			0
i 've worked very hard on my game and i look forward to doing good things for @entity18 again			2
" he would have been the romantic 's choice for a place in @entity18 squad for next month 's @entity37 in @entity111 and @entity218 but he was n't named in the 15 - man squad announced by @entity18 's national selectors at the beginning of january			1
still , the 33 - year - old is still much in demand elsewhere			1
last season , he was the most expensive player in the @entity226 auction , snapped up for rs 14 crore ( $ 2.25 million ) by the @entity227			0
in addition to regular appearances for his state side @entity231 , he is kept busy with his cancer foundation , @entity232 , which raises awareness and funds to fight the disease			2
" i definitely think i 'm inspiring a lot of people , " he says			0
" trust me , it 's not easy to get out of it			0
it 's something which kills you from inside and it takes a lot out of you , your family members and your friends to see what you 're going through			0
that 's why i 'm trying to motivate people and try to help them get their life back			0
" it 's a positive message from a man who could have been forgiven for letting his sporting career fade in the face of such trauma			0
but his love for cricket remains as strong as ever			0
" it 's a sport which never flows in one direction , it 's always up and down			0
you never know which way it 's going to go			0
i just love the unpredictability			0
