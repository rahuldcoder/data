-- a judge ordered an ex-aide to former sen. @entity3 on friday to turn over a sex tape said to depict @entity3 and his former mistress , an official in a @entity8 court said			1
judge @entity9 found former @entity3 aide @entity10 and his wife , @entity11 , in civil contempt of court , said @entity13 , a judicial assistant in @entity14			1
he ordered them to give the court the tape and other materials they may have by 2 p.m. wednesday , she said			1
the judge said he could jail the @entity18 if they do not comply , she said			0
the @entity19 appeared in court in @entity21 , about 35 miles west of @entity22 , @entity8 , to contest a temporary restraining order forbidding them from disseminating the videotape			0
the couple has said they possess " a video recording showing senator @entity3 engaged in sexual activities with a woman who , from all indications , is not his wife and who the @entity18 believe to be ms. @entity34 , based upon her appearance , " court documents say			1
the woman on the tape is visibly pregnant , the @entity18 say			2
that means the video might not be the one specified in the restraining order , because @entity34 , @entity3 ' former mistress , said that tape was created in september 2006 , the @entity18 say			1
" this means that , as a matter of human biology , ms. @entity34 would have given birth no later than june 2007 , " the @entity18 say			0
@entity47 was pregnant in 2007 and gave birth to @entity3 ' daughter @entity49 on february 27 , 2008			2
in the court documents , the @entity18 suggest that @entity47 might have mistaken when the video was made			0
even if that is the case , they say , @entity47 abandoned the videotape in the trash at their home and made no effort to recover it until almost two years after she had left their home			0
friday 's court proceeding is the latest development in a saga involving one - time @entity62 presidential hopeful @entity3			2
in january , he admitted that he had fathered a child with @entity47 , a videographer who worked on his campaign			0
@entity3 , 56 , had publicly denied paternity for more than a year			0
about a week after his admission , @entity3 confirmed reports that he had legally separated from his wife , @entity68			1
those announcements came just before @entity10 released an embarrassing book about the @entity71 and his campaign			0
in the book , @entity10 portrays @entity3 as a cold , calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a girl , risk his marriage and put the @entity62 in potential political jeopardy , all in the name of pursuing the presidency			1
after @entity47 became pregnant , @entity10 says in the book , he agreed to the @entity8 senator 's request to lie , allowed @entity47 to live in his home and said he was the father , though @entity10 was married with three children .			2

new : @entity3 's former aide has until 2 p.m. to turn over video
@entity10 claims he has tape of @entity3 having sex with pregnant woman
@entity3 admitted fathering a child with mistress , has separated from wife @entity68
