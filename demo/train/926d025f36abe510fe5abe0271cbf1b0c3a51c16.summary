@entity0 -- a hoax mayday call that launched a massive search off the coast of @entity6 last week may be linked to a similar call made last month nearly 1,500 miles away off @entity8 , authorities said wednesday			1
at a news conference in @entity12 , @entity10 investigators said that in both cases the callers reported their boats were sinking and used similar key words and phrases , leading authorities to believe the calls could have come from the same individual			1
on may 20 , rescuers searched for 36 hours in waters off the coast of @entity25 , @entity8 , and found nothing after a distress call reporting six people stranded in the water , chief warrant officer @entity21 told @entity1			2
investigators try to track down false yacht mayday on june 11 , a distress call reporting a yacht explosion prompted a massive rescue effort in the water near @entity6			1
the call was determined to be fake after no evidence of a boat was found			0
officials initially classified the @entity8 call as unresolved because the @entity10 could not eliminate the possibility that the distress call came from a vessel in the water			1
but a @entity44 television reporter alerted the @entity10 's @entity12 office to similarities in the two cases , and that led authorities to take a closer look			1
" by no means is it a guarantee that this was the same individual that made both calls			0
we 're analyzing the voices on both calls , " @entity10 capt. @entity55 told reporters			1
in both instances , the caller described his boat as " taking on water " rather than sinking , described the people on board his boat as " souls , " said victims were in orange life rafts and used a similar speaking pattern , @entity55 said			0
investigators said the calls in both cases seem to have originated from land , he added			0
the @entity10 said the estimated cost of the rescue operation in the @entity6 case was $ 300,000			1
the agency is relying on the media and tips from the public to find the callers because current technology is n't capable of allowing investigators to pinpoint exactly where the calls came from			1
@entity10 offers reward after apparent hoax but officials are hoping that the person responsible for the false calls finds it difficult to keep quiet			1
" they do brag about it in certain cases , " @entity55 said			0
more than 100 calls have come in to a tip line , @entity95 special agent @entity94 told reporters wednesday			0
authorities released audio excerpts from both of the mayday calls			1
in the @entity6 incident , a male voice is heard saying , " we have 21 souls on board , 20 in the water right now			2
i have three deceased on board , nine injured because of the explosion we 've had			0
i 'm in three feet of water on the bridge			0
i 'm going to stay by the radio as long as i can before i have to go overboard			0
" in the @entity8 case , the voice says , " we 're about probably 2 miles from the channel and we are taking on water			2
" the caller was unable to give an exact location in either call			0
anyone convicted of making a false mayday call to the @entity10 would face six years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine , but finding such perpetrators has proven difficult for authorities			1
investigations rarely have led to an arrest or conviction			0
there were 60 reported hoax calls in the @entity12 region in 2011 , but since 2004 only four people have been convicted for making false distress claims			2
authorities do n't believe the false calls are terrorism - related			2
