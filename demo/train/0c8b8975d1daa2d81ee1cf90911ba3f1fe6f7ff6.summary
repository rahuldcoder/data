@entity0 -- @entity2 is not a lunatic			2
she is a member of the @entity4 , appointed to that eminent body in 2005 after a career in politics and medicine			2
on february 11 , she was asked a question by www.thejc.com , the online version of @entity13 's @entity12			2
@entity2 serves as patron of an online journal based in @entity16 , the @entity17			2
the previous week , the @entity17 accused the @entity19 medical teams doing humanitarian work in @entity21 of harvesting organs from earthquake victims			1
@entity12 asked @entity2 for comment			2
@entity2 first commended the @entity19 teams for their work in @entity21			1
she then added these words : " to prevent allegations such as these -- which have already been posted on @entity32 -- going any further , the @entity28 and the @entity29 should establish an independent inquiry immediately to clear the names of the team in @entity21			2
" the @entity32 video to which @entity2 refers can be seen here			2
it 's the work of a solo crank , and hardly seems to require an " independent inquiry " to refute			2
the statement to @entity12 was not @entity42 's first entry into @entity44 analysis			2
she has expressed herself often on the subject of @entity19 and @entity19 's supporters , and in vivid terms			1
in a speech to a meeting during her @entity52 's annual conference in 2006 , @entity2 declared : " the @entity54 lobby has got its grips on the western world , its financial grips			2
i think they 've probably got a grip on our party			2
" ( that grip was not too tight to prevent @entity2 's party from collectively denouncing @entity19 for attacking @entity63 after @entity63 kidnapped two @entity19 soldiers			1
) on february 14 , @entity65 was removed from her position as health critic for the @entity52 in the @entity4			0
but @entity2 's comments did not originate in the ether			0
they could be footnoted to a respectable newspaper in @entity72			0
in the summer of 2009 , the @entity72 newspaper @entity73 published a story about a recent mass indictment in @entity76			0
on july 23 , the @entity78 attorney for @entity76 announced the arrest of 44 people for a range of criminal enterprises involving bank fraud , rigging of bids on public projects , trafficking in counterfeit goods , etc. the accused represented the gorgeous mosaic of @entity76 politics , with last names like " @entity91 , " " @entity92 , " " @entity93 , " and " @entity94			0
" some of the names were @entity12			0
one of the @entity12 names , @entity97 , was accused of the lurid crime of trafficking in the purchase and sale of human organs			0
@entity97 was said to have offered sums of $ 10,000 to entice poor people in @entity19 and @entity105 to sell kidneys to him , which he would then remarket for $ 160,000 to transplant patients in the @entity78			1
@entity73 transformed this story of illegal commerce into a story of @entity12 predation			0
the paper gave space to a freelance writer -- @entity116 -- to charge that the @entity19 army regularly harvested organs from the bodies of slain @entity120			1
after briefly acknowledging that the vast majority of the world 's illegally harvested organs come from @entity124 , @entity125 , and the @entity126 , @entity116 then hurled this astounding charge : " palestinians also harbor strong suspicions that young men have been seized , and made to serve as organ reserve , just as in @entity124 and @entity125 , before being killed			0
" @entity12 vampirism is an ancient fantasy , dating back to the @entity134			0
yet it remains current in the contemporary @entity44			0
a @entity137 film company created a multipart tv drama out of the story in 2003			0
the drama was broadcast worldwide on @entity63 's @entity142 satellite network			0
@entity144 state tv broadcast a drama in 2004 in which the plot turns on an @entity19 plan to steal @entity120 children 's eyes			1
it 's a winding road from medieval folktales to @entity142 to the @entity76 mob to a @entity72 daily to the @entity4			0
but it 's a road traveled by more and more people			0
on february 11 , @entity157 's @entity156 presented a paper to the @entity19 cabinet warning of " delegitimization " aimed at the jewish state			1
as reported by @entity163 , the paper warns : " the ' delegitimizers ' cooperate with organizations engaging in legitimate criticism of @entity19 's policy in the territories such as @entity169 [ @entity170 ] and @entity171 , blurring the line between legitimate censure and delegitimization			1
... the network 's activists are not mostly @entity120 , @entity177 or @entity178			0
many of them are @entity181 and @entity183 left - wing activists , " who portray @entity19 as a pariah state and deny its right to exist			1
in the @entity78 , where @entity189 feeling runs stronger and the activist left is weaker , the delegitimization project focuses less on @entity19 itself , and more on @entity19 's supporters			1
the central text for this project is a book called " @entity196 " co-authored by @entity197			0
@entity198 and @entity199 , which argues that " the @entity19 lobby " maneuvered the @entity78 into the @entity202 war on @entity19 's behalf			1
@entity198 and @entity199 present their argument in delicate language , but it 's the same case argued by prof. @entity209 of the @entity210 , again not a crank , but a past president of the @entity213			0
in a 2004 blog post , @entity209 wrote of a " one - two punch secretly planned by the @entity217 faction in the @entity218			1
first , @entity202 would be taken out by the @entity78 , and then @entity144			0
@entity219 , a key member of the group , also wanted @entity137 included			0
these pro-likud intellectuals concluded that 9/11 would give them carte blanche to use the @entity218 as @entity19 's @entity223 regiment , fighting elective wars on behalf of @entity157 ( not wars that really needed to be fought , but wars that the @entity228 coalition thought it would be nice to see fought so as to increase @entity19 's ability to annex land and act aggressively , especially if someone else 's boys did the dying )			1
" hard to miss here the echo of another ancient myth , memorably enunciated by a character in @entity237 's 1915 spy novel , " @entity238			0
" " [ if ] you 're on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the real boss , 10 to one you are brought up against a little white - faced @entity243 in a bath - chair with an eye like a rattlesnake			1
yes , sir , he is the man who is ruling the world just now			0
" @entity198 returned to his theme in a blog post this week in foreign policy : " @entity19 leaders from across the political spectrum became cheerleaders for the invasion , and they played a prominent role in helping to sell the war here in the @entity78			1
" this debate came home to the blogosphere last week , when @entity264 literary editor @entity263 published a long article denouncing uber - blogger @entity266 as either an @entity268 bigot or else " moronically insensitive			1
" @entity266 -- a former editor of the magazine for which his once - intimate friend @entity263 writes -- has over the past few months abruptly switched from passionate champion of @entity19 to strident criticism of @entity19 and its supporters			1
many rallied to @entity266 's defense on the specific complaint at issue , myself included			1
but one wishes that people who do not share the malignant feelings of a @entity2 would take care not to use the same malignant language			0
it 's possible to hate @entity19 without hating @entity243			1
it 's even possible to hate @entity243 without hating @entity19 , as is said of a famously nasty @entity13 media personality : " he managed the impressive feat of being intensely anti-semitic without becoming even slightly pro-arab			1
" but these interesting theoretical potentialities exist mainly on the blackboard			0
in real life , it becomes very difficult to separate hatred of the jewish state from hatred of the @entity243 who live in that state			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity297 .			1

@entity297 says @entity19 is facing a delegitimization campaign
he says some critics engage in wild charges without any foundation
@entity297 says he defended @entity266 against charges of anti-semitism
but he says in other cases , hatred of @entity19 and of @entity243 go hand - in - hand
