-- a @entity2 jury on thursday rejected claims that @entity4 was responsible for the death of a woman in a 2009 crash that resulted from a sudden and uncontrollable acceleration of one of its cars			1
the @entity13 jury returned the verdict after more than four days of deliberations			2
the case was one of a large number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts against the automaker over claims of unintended acceleration in its vehicles			1
" we are gratified that the jury concluded the design of the 2006 @entity30 did not contribute to this unfortunate accident , affirming the same conclusion we reached after more than three years of careful investigation -- that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle at issue in this case , " @entity4 said in a statement posted on its website			1
calling the case a " bellwether , " @entity4 said it believes the verdict also set a " significant benchmark " that its vehicles are safe with or without a brake override system			1
the family of driver @entity46 says that she was driving her 2006 @entity30 in @entity48 , @entity2 , when it suddenly and unexpectedly accelerated to more than 100 mph despite her pressing the brake pedal			2
the car eventually struck a telephone pole			0
@entity4 maintained throughout the trial there was no defect , and that @entity56 's car was equipped with a state - of - the - art braking system			2
the automaker has long maintained that claims about its vehicles ' unintended acceleration are " wholly unsubstantiated			1
" the controversy has already proved costly for @entity4			0
the company announced in december it would take a charge of more than $ 1 billion to settle claims from drivers who say their vehicles lost value as a result of the alleged acceleration problems			0
@entity4 said at the time that it settled simply to bring an end to the litigation , and denied wrongdoing			0
@entity4 was forced to recall more than 8 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010 because of gas - pedal - related issues			1
of that total , 5.8 million were flagged over the potential for their accelerator pedals to become stuck in floor mats			0
some 4.5 million were recalled because of the potential for their gas pedals , after wear , to become sticky			0
more than 2 million vehicles were subject to both recalls			0
@entity46 's @entity88 was not subject to these recalls , though her family 's suit claimed her model was also defective , and that @entity4 failed to include a brake override system to guard against sudden and unexpected acceleration			1
@entity0 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
