@entity1 officials could not be reached on sunday to comment on @entity13 's arrest			1

" this is deeply sad for @entity6 , " said @entity28 , the leader of another @entity6 council based in @entity0 , which is located about 150 miles north of @entity30			2
" even those who were n't strongly associated with the nationalist movement and were fairly assimilated in @entity1 interpret this as an insult to the circassian people , " @entity28 told @entity2			2
circassian activists have criticized the @entity1 government for failing to acknowledge that the @entity40 city of @entity30 is also the traditional homeland of their people			1
" the question is n't whether or not the @entity50 are taking place on our land , " said @entity44 , a @entity6 architect who designed a monument to his people that looms uncompleted over a park in @entity0			2
" the most important thing is when they announced ( the @entity11 ) , they did n't say a word about us			0
they tried to forget us as if we never even lived here , " @entity44 said			0
@entity6 once dominated large swaths of the @entity62 and northern @entity63 coast			0
they were defeated by the @entity1 army in the @entity65 , a conflict that lasted for more than a century , until the mid- 1800s			2
circassian historian @entity66 told @entity2 that the @entity6 fought their last stand against imperial @entity1 in @entity69 , the mountainous area above @entity30 where the @entity71 sports are now being held			1
2014 marks the 150th anniversary of that final battle			0
many @entity6 accuse 19th - century @entity1 of carrying out genocidal massacres of their ancestors , as well as the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of @entity6			1
today , members of the circassian diaspora are scattered across the @entity79 and the @entity80 , along with communities in @entity83 countries like @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
some circassian activists have led an @entity89 campaign on the website nosochi2014.com , which is accompanied by slogans like " @entity30 , the land of genocide			0
" @entity1 president @entity93 , who personally lobbied for @entity30 to host the @entity11 , has repeatedly urged observers to avoid mixing politics with sport			0
the @entity1 government has been particularly sensitive to criticism of the @entity99			1
on february 7 , several activists carrying the rainbow flag of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender movement were detained while singing the @entity1 national anthem in @entity107 's @entity106			0

human rights activists in @entity1 as well as the @entity80 - based group @entity113 denounced the verdict , claiming it was politically motivated			2
on sunday , a spokesman for the @entity116 sided with @entity1 authorities on the @entity119 verdict			0

friends and relatives said @entity13 had been active in resettling in the region at least 10 families of @entity6 refugees who had fled @entity85 's civil war			2
as news of @entity13 's arrest spread this weekend , several prominent @entity6 asked @entity2 not to publish their interviews for fear of punishment at the hands of @entity1 authorities			1
" this has led a great number of people to conclude that anybody who deals with the @entity6 question -- even the most loyal -- will now be under pressure , " said @entity28 , the @entity6 community leader in @entity0			1
@entity2 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
