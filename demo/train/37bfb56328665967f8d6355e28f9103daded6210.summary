-- it 's not exactly the war of the roses , but a @entity5 couple is taking a divorce case to a new level			1
dr. @entity8 ( left ) and his attorney , @entity9 , says the divorce case is not just about a kidney			2
dr. @entity8 and his wife , @entity12 , are fighting over a kidney he gave her			1
@entity8 and his attorney , @entity9 , appeared on @entity0 's @entity16 on wednesday to discuss the case and why he filed a lawsuit			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity22 : when did the wife need the kidney ? @entity8 : well , she needed three of them			1
the one that i donated was back in 2001			2
@entity22 : who else donated ? @entity8 : her father donated the first kidney in -- well , i 'm going to go back -- when she was 13 years old			1
the second kidney she needed after two years of our marriage and that was back in 1992			2
thereafter , we had three children , prompting the third kidney transplant , which took place in 2001			1
@entity22 : how is she doing now ? do you know ? @entity8 : to the best of my knowledge , i understand that her kidney is doing better than mine			1
@entity22 : when did the marriage go bad ? @entity8 : it 's hard to say , but it was not on a good foundation around the time of the third transplant			1
@entity22 : what 's it like , by the way , to donate a kidney ? @entity8 : well , it is probably the most wonderful feeling that you can possibly ever imagine on this planet			1
@entity22 : is the surgery difficult ? @entity8 : the surgery , for me , was performed arthroscopically , so i have several port incisions , with a separate hand incision to allow for the kidney to be extracted			1
the surgery discomfort and pain itself was not all that horrendous , very tolerable			0
i was on my feet the following day			0
@entity22 : what was the cause of the divorce ? @entity8 : well , she has her allegations			2
@entity22 : what were yours ? @entity8 : infidelity			2
@entity9 : actually , @entity22 , in the state of @entity5 , it 's one of the grounds for divorce			1
when the show started , you mentioned the demand for the kidney or the value			0
really , that 's not what 's going on			0
we use that as an example of what the doctor wants			0
what the doctor wants is , a ) health to be taken into consideration in the division of the assets , whether or not she 'd be entitled to maintenance or not			0
but most of all , ( what 's ) being done so he can be part of the children 's lives			2
that 's what really this case is all about			2
@entity22 : he 's not allowed to be part of their lives now ? @entity8 : it is my belief that the influence that the children are under , from the household , has put such a pressure on them that they no longer have visitation time with me , despite my most strongest efforts , both through phone call attempts through their mother and through the court system			1
@entity22 : what is he going to do with a kidney back ? @entity126 : he does n't want the kidney			1
remember , this is a @entity129 - like act when one gives a kidney			2
you can certainly understand that			0
no , what he wants the court to do is take into consideration what he 's done , what a wonderful thing it is he 's done and some understanding from the court			0
you know , it 's so strange ; here he does this , and when he says he 's allowed to see his children , well , legally he is , but these children have been so alienated from him			0
by the way , prior to the divorce , you should know that this was a 24/7 dad			0
the children loved him dearly			0
he 's a broken - hearted man from that			0
before we started the litigation , we thought very deeply how it 's going to affect everyone			0
it was out of desperation that he did it			0
@entity22 : dr. @entity8 , you think this might affect other people donating kidneys ? @entity8 : i hope , at the very least , first of all , i have to say that the real issue here is for me to get my children back			1
aside from that , to draw light to the lack of kidney availability , to the number of poor and dying patients across the country who are yearning to live			0
i hope , and it 's my prayer , that this fallout will help enlighten those people who have any question about organ donation come forward , because there are so many people who are dying as a result of not having an organ			1
@entity22 : in view of how bitter this has gotten , dr. @entity8 , if you had to do it over again , would you not donate it ? @entity8 : without hesitation , i would give another kidney .			1

doctor says he hopes case will not deter organ donation
