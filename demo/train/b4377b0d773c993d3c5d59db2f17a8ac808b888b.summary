@entity1 , @entity0 -- in the early days of the @entity4 , there was hope that the unprecedented tool for global communication would lead to thoughtful sharing and discussion on its most popular sites			0
a decade and a half later , the very idea is laughable , says @entity13 founder @entity12			1
" it did n't happen , " said @entity12 , whose properties include the blogs @entity13 , @entity16 , @entity17 , io9 and @entity19			1
" it 's a promise that has so not happened that people do n't even have that ambition anymore			0
" the idea of capturing the intelligence of the readership -- that 's a joke			1
" @entity12 was speaking at @entity27 , the annual festival here devoted to @entity30 and digital culture			1
he said that commenting on his own sites ( which he 's seen make reporters cry ) has gotten so bad that he does n't engage			0
" i do n't like going into the comments			2
... for every two comments that are interesting -- even if they 're critical , you want to engage with them -- there will be eight that are off - topic or just toxic , " he said			2
and as sites get more popular , it 's harder to control the comments , which inevitably get nastier			1
" what you can manage on a small site ... the level of discussion you can have on those is not the level you 're able to have on a newspaper site or one of our sites			2
our smaller blogs have 2 million unique ( visitors per month )			0
... it 's hard to have that intimacy			0
" so , what 's the solution ? when it comes to improving open discussion threads , @entity65 , during an interview - style discussion with blogger and @entity70 director @entity69 , seemed quicker to shoot down ideas that others are trying than to provide proposals of his own			2
having editors and reporters engage their readers in the comments ? " the writer of the piece has to move on to the next piece			2
they do n't have time to moderate all those comments			2
" require readers to post using their real names ? " my own view is that anonymity is at the heart of the @entity4			0
" give other commenters more power to " up - vote " or " down - vote " posts ? " we do n't really believe in the democratic process of decision - making when it comes to discussion , " @entity12 said			1
for example , he said , @entity16 has made lots of hay off of sexual harassment accusations against @entity102 chief executive officer @entity101			2
@entity12 said he 'd love to see @entity101 come into the comments section to defend himself			1
" if you put it to a vote , 90 % would vote to ban him			0
they hate that guy , " @entity12 said			1
" if @entity101 went into the @entity16 comments , he 'd be torn limb from limb ; his limbs are n't all that would be torn off			0
" the answer ? @entity12 said his sites are planning to post some stories that allow only a hand - picked , pre-approved group of people to comment on them			1
that , he said , would make the comment section an extension of the story and allow people , like @entity101 in the above example , to have their say without fear of being piled onto by others			0
" i think it 's part of the answer , " he said			0
" what i want is , i want the sources -- i want the experts to be able to comment in these discussions			0
" when he took questions , @entity12 had to do a little answering about the responsibility the tone of a site itself has in guiding its comments section			1
many of @entity13 's sites are n't known for being particularly delicate ( one of today 's top @entity13 headlines : " @entity144 's @entity143 , @entity145 " )			1
" it 's certainly true that nice sites run by nice people ... that encourages good behavior , " @entity12 said			1
" but it 's not as if it 's entirely the writer setting the tone for the comments			0
sometimes , it 's the comments setting the tone for the writer			0

@entity13 chief : idea of *positive* online comments has become a joke
@entity12 speaks at the @entity27 festival
he said the bigger a site is , the harder it is to curate comment sections
one idea ? making certain stories only open to a few select commenters
