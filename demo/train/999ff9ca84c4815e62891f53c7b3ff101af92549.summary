-- in the rearview mirror of history , the @entity2 administration can look monstrous			1
it features a brilliant but insecure and almost constantly cursing chief executive who ruined a landslide 49 - state re-election with a corrupt cover - up of a burglary ordered from within the @entity10			2
but what 's often forgotten is that @entity2 presided over a first term of surprisingly unifying and effective governance amid a time of deep cultural divides -- and that people went to work for him , at the hinge of the 1960s and ' 70s , with a genuine sense of idealism			1
@entity22 ' brilliant new documentary " @entity23 " offers a firsthand look at the @entity2 years from the vantage of his inner circle			1
the behind - the - scenes footage literally comes from the @entity30 vaults -- more than 500 reels of @entity33 home movies seized from key aides @entity34 , @entity36 and @entity37 before they went to prison for involvement in @entity40			1
forty years later , the footage has been rescued from obscurity by filmmaker @entity42 and edited in a witty way that transports the viewer back to the @entity2 era			1
it is a surreal and illuminating experience			0
i was born in 1973 , the day before @entity2 's second inauguration			1
" @entity23 " offers a glimpse into an @entity50 on the periphery of my experience , awkwardly caught in between the crew cuts of the @entity54 and the longhairs protesting on the @entity56			2
opinion : the inner demons that drove @entity2 the biggest revelation is @entity2 himself , shown in his prime at the film 's outset -- tan , tested and ready , confidently meeting with world leaders at a time of maximum @entity50 power			1
this was a man in full before his fall , starting the @entity71 , opening relations with @entity73 and ending @entity50 involvement in the war in @entity76			0
against this heady backdrop , @entity34 , @entity36 and @entity37 come across as idealistic and almost giddy with the trappings of power			1
in the opening credits , the documentary shows @entity34 , @entity2 's chief of staff , grinning widely and goofing for the camera over the ironic soundtrack of @entity84 's " @entity83			1
" domestic policy adviser @entity36 comes across as intelligent and initially independent			2
special assistant @entity37 looks like a @entity86 model moonlighting in midcentury government , earnestly pronouncing that " i never laughed as much as when i was in the @entity54			2
" they are finally the stars of their own home movies			0
but the old axiom that power corrupts quickly becomes apparent as we see and hear ( courtesy of the infamous secret taping device ) the @entity2 aides jockeying for influence and sliding into self - serving group think			1
at one point , @entity2 is caught complaining about an episode of " @entity101 " -- a cultural phenomenon he needs explained to him by @entity34 -- and we are treated to this unvarnished @entity105 diatribe			1
" @entity106 was a homo			0
so was @entity110 , " @entity2 grumbles			2
" the last six roman emperors were fags			0
... you see , homosexuality , dope , immorality in general , these are the enemies of strong societies			0
that 's why the communists and left - wingers are pushing the stuff			0
they 're trying to destroy us			0
" @entity36 then joins the presidential pile - on and proclaims the dynamic " fatal liberality ... a different set of values that has been induced			2
" this is evidence of the impulse to encourage a boss ' worst instincts to curry favor			0
that instinct ultimately led to the solicitation of the watergate break - in and other fatal misadventures -- all unnecessary , given @entity140 landslide mandate			0
and so slowly the noose tightens around the @entity2 inner circle			1
opinion : four lessons from @entity2 's failed presidency @entity37 , the last living member of the troika , becomes the first to get thrown under the bus and sent to prison			1
@entity2 is caught on tape trying to claim plausible deniability about the break - ins in a conversation with @entity36 , trying to prompt his aide to give him absolution			1
but under fire @entity36 wo n't play ball			2
" i should have been told about that , should n't i ? " @entity2 asks in a leading question reflecting his legal training			2
" well , i 'm not so sure you that you were n't			0
my recollection is that this was discussed with you , " @entity36 replies			0
at which point @entity2 starts nervously stammering and saying , " my @entity164			0
" ultimately , @entity2 reluctantly requests the resignation of his right - hand men , @entity34 and @entity36 , in an attempt to cut out the cancer of scandal afflicting his administration			1
in perhaps the most raw @entity2 moment caught on tape , the president asks @entity34 if he did all right by him after announcing his resignation on national television			1
" i 'm never going to discuss this sonofabitching @entity40 thing again , " @entity2 says , softly slurring his words , " but let me say that you 're a strong man and i love you			0
" the sum total of the film is humanizing to @entity2 and the men who surrounded him , capturing the surrealism of life in the @entity10 bubble			1
these men are n't monsters , however disastrous and devious their actions in the @entity105 ultimately proved to be			0
" @entity23 " wo n't satisfy the @entity2 haters , of whom there are still many , but it is bracing , engaging history			0
it accurately reflects the long ago reality of this pivotal failed administration			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : documentary looks at @entity54 from vantage of inner circle
he says it shows @entity36 , @entity34 as idealistic aides in early @entity2 era
he says it also shows @entity2 's crass *viewpoints* and aide 's *sycophancy*
@entity197 : film humanizes @entity2 , captures surrealism of life in @entity10 bubble
