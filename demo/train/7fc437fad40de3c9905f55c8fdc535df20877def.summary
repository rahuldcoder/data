-- " @entity5 's " @entity1 always did have a bad habit of putting his foot in his mouth			2
while doing press for his work with @entity8 , the actor who played that wealthy gent on @entity12 's iconic series apparently tried to make a joke that 's not likely to go over well among " @entity5 " fans			1
while speaking with @entity18 outlet @entity16 , @entity15 dropped this comment about the charming but manipulative @entity1 and his relationship with @entity22 's romance - loving @entity21 : " he was what he was			1
one of the things i tell people is that he never tried to pretend he was anything other than what he was , " @entity15 said			2
" it was ( @entity21 ) who tried to pretend he was something he was n't			2
he was always honest about himself ; he never cheated on her			0
the relationship just did n't work , and he went on to get married while she went on to ... how many boyfriends did she have ? she was such a whore ! there 's a misconception that @entity21 was a victim of him , and that 's not the case			2
she was a strong , smart woman			0
" @entity16 notes that @entity44 made his remark about the @entity21 character with a laugh , which would indicate that the actor was being facetious			1
as @entity54 points out , the triumph of " @entity5 " -- and what made it a landmark program during its six - season run -- was @entity21 's navigation of being single and all the elation , struggle , boyfriends and one - night - stands that came with it			1
for once , the idea of getting married was just one of life 's many questions for a 30 - something woman , not the explicit goal			0
questionable humor aside , @entity15 was more serious about how theshow affected his beloved city , @entity68			1
" the @entity68 that ' @entity5 ' depicted is not the @entity68 that i love , " @entity15 said			1
" @entity68 was a much bigger , more interesting place than just fashion and glitz and all that crap			0
it 's become its own nightmare			0
... @entity75 used to have a real rainbow coalition of class and ethnicity , but it 's being pushed out			0
it 's almost like @entity68 became the ( fantasy ) city that ' @entity5 ' depicted , which i find particularly boring			1
" a third movie based on the long - running show is rumored to be in the works			0
@entity22 teams up with @entity88 ceo			0

@entity15 made a questionable joke in an @entity18 paper
the " @entity5 " actor called character @entity21 " a whore "
he also is n't happy with how " @entity5 " depicted @entity68
