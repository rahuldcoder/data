@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was august , 2011 , the night rebels seized control of @entity8 leader @entity7 's compound and @entity9 fell			2
i 'd already done a couple of business shows earlier that day and was about to go home when the news broke			1
i ended up staying on the air through 4am			2
i did n't know it then , but i was having my own attack as well			2
@entity18 , the harsh studio lights			2
i could barely focus my eyes on the camera in front of me			0
fortunately , we do not use teleprompters in breaking news situations			1
it 's almost all ad - libbed			1
there was no way i could have read any words on a screen			0
organizing sentences in my brain became increasingly difficult -- and it was n't just the usual fatigue from a sustained marathon of breaking news at @entity2			1
by the end of it , my face felt numb , and i thought this must be what it 's like when someone 's having a stroke			0
out of the studio , the racket of my earpiece out of my head , the lights dimmed , i immediately felt better , made it home and flopped into bed			0
when i awoke the next afternoon , it was all " @entity53			0
" the room , the hallway , the doorframes , everything was on a tilt			0
i was so dizzy , i had to hold on with both hands to walk down the hall			1
this was my first major flare - up of a compromised vestibular system , the complex network of the inner ear , the brain and the eyes we never think about , but is largely responsible for keeping humans upright			1
one doctor thought it was @entity72 's disease since i had previously suffered hearing loss in my left ear			0
am i going deaf ? no one could answer			0
it took a couple of months , but i finally found the right doctor who specialized in vestibular disorders and who nailed it right away			1
i also learned i was in good company			0
according to the @entity83 ( @entity84 ) , an estimated 35 percent of @entity85 aged 40 or older experience vertigo or persistent dizziness sometime in their lives			1
that 's about 70 million @entity85			1
@entity92 stars @entity93 and @entity94 , and the @entity96 's @entity95 and @entity97 are just a few famous professional athletes and public figures who suffered vestibular problems related to concussion or injury			1
some have been career - ending			1
many cases remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed			0
having a chronic vestibular problem is a bit like having a hurricane inside your head			1
while the disorder is often associated with brain injuries , anyone can get hit			2
in my case , it was a combination of the hearing loss and the work environment : bright lights , loud noise , intense stress and fatigue which are all typical in the life of a news anchor on a 24 - hour , international network			1
@entity123 - based chiropractic neurologist dr. @entity122 , who sees patients from all over the world , including dozens of celebrity athletes , says : " people lose their autonomy with vestibular issues			1
" there is nothing better ... than when i see a person who ca n't walk without their hands on a wall get their life back			1
" @entity122 points to the prevalence of falls which he says are the greatest cause of accidental death after the age of 21			2
" we have tens of millions of patients at risk of falling and do n't even know it			0
" you can feel good because the brain compensates , but the compensation is n't permanent and it is n't full			0
" people are aware of heart attacks and cancer , but they 're walking around in a bigger time bomb			0
" @entity153 , executive director of @entity84 , adds : " many of our members tell us that they feel they have an invisible chronic illness			0
" their symptoms and condition are not always acknowledged , leaving them to deal with the devastating consequences on their own			0
" that 's where public awareness comes in			2
@entity84 promotes " @entity167 " to encourage undiagnosed patients to seek help from a vestibular specialist			1
reducing the time it takes to be diagnosed could save lives			2
in my case , a quick diagnosis and the right therapy put my life back on track			0
although protecting my hearing , and managing fatigue and stress mean tv anchoring is out , i 'm passionate about advocating and mentoring the next generation of journalists at @entity183			2
it 's a slower , calmer life , but it 's also a balanced life , literally			0
" @entity167 " in the @entity85 is september 15 - 21			1
@entity84 has partners in the @entity186 and @entity187 as well .			0

@entity189 finished a shift anchoring breaking news so dizzy she had to hold on to the wall to walk
she was diagnosed with a vestibular disorder , something that *affects* about 70 million @entity85
@entity167 , from september 15 - 21 in the @entity85 , hopes to raise awareness
the awareness campaign is backed by the @entity83
