there has n't been a government shutdown in more than 17 years , since the 28 days of budget stalemate in the @entity4 administration that cost more than $ 1 billion			0
now we hear dire warnings and sharpening rhetoric that another shutdown is possible and perhaps likely in less than two weeks when the current fiscal year ends			0
despite an escalating political imbroglio , the combination of how @entity11 works and what politicians want makes the chances of a shutdown at the end of the month uncertain at best			1
in particular , a rift between @entity18 over how to proceed has heightened concerns of a shutdown in the short run , but remains a major reason why one is unlikely in the end			1
a more probable scenario is a last - minute compromise on a short - term spending plan to fund the government when the current fiscal year ends on september 30			1
after that , the debate would shift to broader deficit reduction issues tied to the need to raise the federal debt ceiling sometime in october			0
" there 's going to be a lot of draconian talk from both sides , but the likelihood of their being an extended shutdown is not high , " said @entity34 , the vice president and director of governance studies at the @entity36			0
government shutdown : again ? seriously ? conservatives tie @entity46 to budget talks while the main issue is keeping the government funded when the new fiscal year begins october 1 , a conservative @entity18 wing in the @entity52 and @entity53 has made its crusade against @entity46 the focus of the debate			1
they demand a halt to funding for the signature program from president @entity62 's first term , and they seem indifferent about forcing a government shutdown if that does n't happen			1
" i will do everything necessary and anything possible to defund @entity46 , " @entity18 sen. @entity66 of @entity67 said thursday , threatening a filibuster and " any procedural means necessary			1
" the @entity18 split was demonstrated later thursday by sen. @entity72 , who told @entity73 that " we will not repeal or defund @entity46 " in the @entity53			1
" we will not , and to think we can is not rational , " @entity72 said			0
a compromise sought by @entity52 speaker @entity76 and fellow @entity18 leaders would have allowed a symbolic vote on the defunding provision that the @entity53 would then strip out			1
the result would have been what legislators call a " clean " final version that simply extended current levels of government spending for about two months of the new fiscal year , allowing time for further negotiations on the debt ceiling			2
however , conservative opposition to the compromise made @entity76 agree to a tougher version that made overall government funding contingent on eliminating money for @entity46			1
moderate @entity18 question the strategy , but fear a right - wing backlash in the 2014 primaries if they go against the conservative wing			2
in reference to the divisions in the @entity52 , @entity72 said it was " pretty obvious that ( @entity76 ) has great difficulties within his own conference			2
" the @entity52 passed the tea party inspired plan on an almost strictly party line vote on friday , setting in motion what is certain to be 10 days or so of legislative wrangling and political machinations			0
the measure now goes to the @entity112 - led @entity53 , where majority leader @entity113 made clear on thursday that any plan to defund @entity46 would be dead on arrival			1
instead , the @entity53 was expected to strip the measure of all provisions defunding @entity46 and send it back to the @entity52			2
" they 're simply postponing an inevitable choice they must face , " @entity113 said of @entity52 republicans			0
here is a look at the two most - discussed potential outcomes -- a government shutdown or a short - term deal that keeps the government funded for a few months while further debate ensues			0
@entity52 @entity18 : defund @entity46 or shut government down shutdown scenario according to @entity34 , the ultimate pressure on whether there is a shutdown will rest with @entity76			1
with the @entity18 majority in the @entity52 passing the spending measure that defunds @entity46 , @entity136 say they will stand united in opposing it			1
" do n't make it part of your strategy that eventually we 'll cave , " sen. @entity138 of @entity139 warned @entity18 on thursday			2
we 're unified , we 're together			0
" that means the @entity53 would remove any provisions to defund @entity46 and send the stripped - down spending proposal back to the @entity52			1
@entity76 would then have to decide whether to put it to a vote , even though that could undermine his already weakened leadership by having the measure pass with only a few dozen moderate republicans joining @entity136 in support			2
if he refuses to bring the @entity53 version to the floor for a vote , a shutdown would ensue			0
" the key player is really @entity76 , " @entity34 said			2
polls showing a decrease in public support for the health care reforms embolden the @entity18 stance			2
meanwhile , surveys showing most people oppose a government shutdown and that more would blame @entity18 if it happens bolster @entity112 resolve			1
compromise scenario voices across the political spectrum warn against a shutdown , including @entity176 director @entity175 , @entity178 chairman @entity177 , the @entity179 and @entity18 strategist @entity180			2
" even the defund strategy 's authors say they do n't want a government shutdown			0
but their approach means we 'll get one , " @entity180 argued in an op - ed published thursday by the @entity184			0
he noted the @entity112 - controlled @entity53 wo n't support any @entity52 measure that eliminates funding for @entity46 , and the @entity52 said thursday that @entity62 would veto such a spending resolution			1
" republicans would need 54 @entity52 @entity136 and 21 @entity136 to vote to override the president 's veto , " @entity180 noted , adding that " no sentient being believes that will happen			0
" @entity34 concurred , telling @entity73 that " you ca n't expect a president to offer his first born to solve a political problem for the other party			0
" " it 's the @entity52 split that 's causing this to happen , " he noted			0
" people now equate compromise with surrender			0
it 's hard to do anything under those circumstances			0
" under the compromise scenario , the @entity53 would remove provisions defunding @entity46 from what the @entity52 passes while perhaps making other relatively minor changes to provide @entity76 and @entity52 @entity18 with political cover to back it .			1

@entity11 faces a *showdown* on funding the government after september 30
a split among @entity18 over how to proceed causes uncertainty
@entity221 conservatives want to defund @entity46 in any spending plan
*analyst* : ultimately , the pressure is on house speaker @entity76
