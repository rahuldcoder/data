@entity0 footage of @entity4 soccer fans apparently pushing a black man off a train in @entity7 on tuesday have startled news followers around the world			1
it is n't hard to see why			0
not only do the menacing fans , who were in the @entity16 capital to watch their team play @entity18 , gruffly prevent the man from boarding the @entity20 ; they then start to chant : " we 're racist , we 're racist , and that 's the way we like it ! " to behave in a racist fashion is bad enough ; to boast of being racist takes things to a whole other level of wrongness			1
so it 's not surprising that everyone from the @entity16 press to @entity29 -- the @entity29 -- has condemned the men 's behavior , and that the video of the alarming episode is trending on @entity34 , accompanied by outraged hashtags			2
yet while it is right to find the conduct of these fans nauseating , it is wrong to hold this incident up as exhibit a in a show trial of @entity44 soccer more broadly			1
sadly , that is what is happening			0
many observers are using this incident as hard evidence that @entity44 soccer remains an unreconstructed backwater , a sport stuck in a past , malign time , followed by prejudiced people			1
but actually , soccer is n't like that anymore			2
a columnist for the @entity55 described the @entity4 men as a " mob of filthy fans " whose behavior was a " throwback to the @entity62 terrace culture " -- that era when hooliganism was a genuine problem at @entity67 soccer games and racist attitudes were fairly widespread			1
he slams us all for " foolishly believ ( ing ) this shameful behaviour was a thing of the past			0
" the fans ' shoving and chanting spoke to the " lingering nastiness " in the so - called @entity77 , said one @entity79 writer			0
another suggested soccer is inherently racist , because it is " all about feeling that you 're part of one group and are opposed to another group ... the mentality of the racist			1
" so should we assume that soccer fans are more likely than others to harbor hateful thoughts for the @entity91 ? these shrill responses to one ugly incident do a grave disservice to both soccer and the millions of good people -- men , women and children of all races -- who follow it			1
the truth is that racism and violence at @entity44 soccer games , which were big problems in the past , have thankfully become rarer and rarer			1
according to figures from the @entity112 , the number of arrests for " racist or indecent chanting " at soccer matches has declined steadily over the past 15 years -- from 82 in the 2000/01 soccer season to 21 in 2013/14			1
( and not all these chants will have been racist ; the @entity112 does n't distinguish between chants that are racist and chants that are foul in other ways , for example , containing sexually explicit words			1
) the specter of the rough @entity67 hooligan is also disappearing			0
@entity112 figures show that arrests in general at soccer , for all crimes , have declined over 15 years , from more than 4,000 in 2000/01 to 2,273 in 2013/14			0
and bear in mind that last year there were 30 million attendances at soccer matches			0
that means a measly 0.0075 % of fans got into trouble with police , which is statistically insignificant			0
today , more than 30 % of soccer players in @entity44 are black			1
this represents a huge increase in the space of a decade : in 2004 the @entity139 found that 12.2 % of players were black			0
can the media outlets deriding soccer for its alleged built - in racism show that 30 % of their employees are black ? as the number of black players increased , so the disgusting behavior of some fans of the past has declined			1
to be sure , some fans have behaved in a shockingly racist way over the decades			2
in the 1960s , when black players were a rarer sight , two black players for @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 , were the victims of monkey chants and banana throwing			2
as late as the 1980s , bananas were thrown at black players : in one infamous photo from 1987 , black @entity162 player @entity161 could be seen kicking off the field a banana that had been hurled at him			0
yet it is rare indeed to read newspaper reports of such behavior today			0
we should not condemn an entire sport and its millions of followers on the basis of what a tiny number of men did and said on a train in @entity7			0
in fact , to do so is to promote another kind of prejudice , a view of the largely white working - class fans of soccer as uncouth , stupid , unenlightened			2
one commentary piece used the word @entity185 to describe fans			0
that 's the great irony of much of the outrage over the @entity4 fans ' terrible behavior : in seeking to expose the alleged prejudices of the soccer family , many observers end up exposing their own .			2

@entity195 : video of fans pushing black man , shouting racist chants plays to *stereotype*
@entity195 : conduct was horrible but is far from the norm today
racism and violence are way down in @entity44 soccer , he says
