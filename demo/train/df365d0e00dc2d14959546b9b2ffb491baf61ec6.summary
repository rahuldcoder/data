-- from the moment justice @entity2 announced he 'd be stepping down , @entity1 has been gearing up for a confirmation fight			0
but as senator @entity6 ( @entity7 ) told judge @entity8 yesterday , " unless you have a complete meltdown , you are going to get confirmed			0
" @entity9 is not the only nominee who did not make it to the @entity12			1
let 's take a look back at eight nominees who did n't make it to the bench , at least on their first try			1
@entity9 in our time , the most famous rejected nominee is @entity9 , a legal scholar and @entity23 judge with a long paper trail of conservative opinions			2
nominated by president @entity26 in 1987 , @entity9 could have tilted the court decisively to the right			0
as a known quantity , he was an easy target for liberal opponents , who organized a campaign against him			0
he was rejected by the @entity34 after 12 days of hearings			2
@entity0 : @entity1 's struggle to find a chief justice 2			2
@entity38 " @entity39 degraded @entity40 ! how humiliating to the friends of moral virtue -- of religion and of all that is dear to the lover of his country ! " the @entity41 wailed in 1811 over president @entity43 's nomination of customs inspector @entity38			1
@entity38 's strong enforcement of the controversial embargoes against @entity53 and @entity54 cost him support in the @entity34 and in the press			1
the @entity34 turned him down by a 9 - 24 vote , the widest rejection in @entity12 history			1
@entity60 @entity60 ( pronounced tawny ) is largely remembered as the chief justice who handed down the @entity64 decision in 1857			0
with his sepulchral countenance , @entity60 is inextricably linked to the grim ruling that all blacks -- slaves as well as free -- were not and could never become citizens of the @entity69			0
but when president @entity71 nominated him in 1835 as associate justice , opposition @entity70 were still smarting from @entity60 's removal of government deposits from the @entity75 while he was a recess - appointed secretary of the treasury			1
the @entity34 voted to indefinitely postpone the nomination			2
however , after chief justice @entity78 died in 1836 , @entity71 sent @entity60 's name up again			2
he was confirmed , this time as chief justice			0
@entity80 you might think the @entity34 just could n't stomach elevating to the highest court in the land a man with the name @entity80 , but it seems the senators were offended by something other than aesthetics			1
as president @entity90 's attorney general , @entity80 had insisted on rewarding merit rather than political loyalty , thus blocking a well - trod route for patronage			1
so when @entity90 nominated @entity80 to the @entity12 in 1869 , miffed @entity96 senators gave the virtuous @entity80 thumbs down			1
@entity0 : what was @entity98 v. @entity99 ? who were @entity101 and @entity101 ? 5 and 6			0
@entity102 and @entity103 a senator has the right to reject a court nomination simply because the nominee is from the senator 's home state			1
upon this invocation of " senatorial courtesy " rests the demise of @entity102 and @entity103			1
both men were nominated by president @entity114			0
both nominees were @entity116 , and @entity118 sen. @entity117 invoked senatorial courtesy to squelch their nominations in 1894			1
( @entity102 's brother , @entity121 , became a justice in 1896			1
@entity123 some nominees withdrew themselves from consideration before they could be rejected			2
such was the case of @entity123 , whom president @entity127 nominated in 2005 , but withdrew under criticism that she was unqualified			0
@entity0 : why there 's a @entity131 statue at the @entity12 ? 8			1
@entity132 another withdrawal was that of @entity132 ( not related to current justice @entity134 ) , the conservative , former pot - smoking federal appellate judge who is a footnote in the @entity9 saga			2
after @entity9 was borked , @entity26 eyed the more moderate @entity139 for the seat			2
but sen. @entity141 ( @entity142 ) threatened a filibuster			0
so @entity26 turned right again and proposed @entity134			0
but there was no getting around the revelation that @entity134 had inhaled			0
@entity134 withdrew himself from consideration , @entity26 put forward @entity139 and the @entity34 , eager to move on , easily confirmed him			0
