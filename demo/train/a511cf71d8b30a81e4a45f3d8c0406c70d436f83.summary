-- when i won the reality show competition " survivor : @entity4 " in 2001 , i never dreamed that an obscure @entity4 flower would provide the drug that later helped me survive cancer			1
but that 's the way my life has unfolded			1
one day i was battling opponents for a million dollars , the next i was battling lymphoma for my life			2
i could n't have won either fight without having nature on my side			2
now i 'm working hard to protect natural areas that will provide the source of future drugs that could save millions of lives			1
on the show we were expected to live off the land			2
i learned very early that survival would mean figuring out how to work with , rather than against , nature			2
we used thorny acacia plants to keep predators away from our camp			2
we drank from the same watering hole as elephants and giraffes , learning the best times to drink and how to stay out of their way			0
nature was a good teacher			0
i won $ 1 million and the confidence that i could survive just about any challenge			0
in 2009 , i was diagnosed with @entity37 's lymphoma , and it turned out that the confidence i gained on " @entity40 " proved even more valuable than the million dollars			1
but not even the trials of the show could have prepared me for the greatest struggle of my life			0
chemotherapy drugs wracked my body for months			0
but as they worked i found some comfort when i learned that one of them was derived from an @entity4 flower , the rosy periwinkle			1
the drug born of this flower , vincristine , was part of the regimen that saved my life			0
my cancer is now in remission and once again i owe my survival to working with nature			1
my case is not an isolated one			0
it turns out that dozens of plants in nature manufacture anti-cancer agents as chemical defenses			0
scientists figured this out years ago , and 80 percent of all anti-cancer drugs possess an active ingredient from the natural world			1
this promise extends to other diseases as well , with half the new drugs created in the past 25 years derived from nature			0
according to a recent study , natural drugs and related products are used to treat 87 percent of all known diseases , including cancer , heart disease , diabetes and @entity85			1
yet this pharmaceutical pipeline is in danger			0
researchers unraveled the biochemistry of the snakeroot plant to improve the treatment of hypertension , but the plant is now threatened by deforestation in @entity95			1
scientists derived a compound for treating severe chronic pain from a cone snail found in @entity101 coral reefs , though its habitat is now threatened by destructive fishing practices and marine pollution			0
the first antiviral medication approved for the treatment of @entity107 came from a marine sponge , yet marine habitats around the world are threatened by pollution , overfishing and climate change			1
given the accelerating destruction of rainforests , reefs and other natural habitats around the world , we must take action today -- as there 's no telling how many useful undiscovered natural compounds we could lose for tomorrow			1
right now , there 's a bipartisan bill in @entity126 , the @entity127 of 2010 , that seeks to address extinction and natural resource depletion worldwide by laying out a strategy for helping other countries protect millions of square miles of natural habitat			1
president @entity134 must put his weight behind this bill and the @entity126 must pass it soon			1
according to the @entity139 , more than 16,000 species , plant and animal alike , are in danger of extinction , largely because of human activities			1
indeed , scientists warn that two - thirds of the planet 's 10 million species could face extinction by the end of the century			2
@entity147 is not on our side			0
i won " survivor : @entity4 , " and i 've won my battle against cancer			1
but in each case , i did n't do it alone			0
i had the most unlikely of partners : a small watering hole and , later , a flower			0
i do n't know what i 'll need from nature next or where the newest nature - based medicines will come from , but i 'm not willing to risk losing any of them			0
the rosy periwinkle saved my life			0
who knows what could save yours ?			2
