the @entity1 aerial games of chicken portrayed in the movie " @entity4 " are happening in real life again nearly 30 years later			0
a @entity8 @entity7 spy plane evaded an encounter with the @entity11 military on july 18 , just a day after @entity12 was downed by a suspected surface - to - air missile that @entity14 and the @entity15 allege was fired by @entity17 rebels in eastern @entity14			1
the @entity19 fled into nearby @entity21 airspace without that country 's permission , a @entity8 military official told @entity24			1
the airplane may have gone through other countries ' airspace as well , though it 's not clear if it had permission to do so			0
the @entity8 plane had been flying in international airspace , conducting an electronic eavesdropping mission on the @entity11 military , when the @entity11 took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land - based radar			1
the @entity11 then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the aircraft , the @entity8 official said saturday			1
the spy plane crew felt so concerned about the radar tracking that it wanted to get out of the area as quickly as possible , the official said			2
the quickest route away from the @entity11 took them into @entity21 airspace			1
the @entity8 official acknowledged that was done without @entity21 military approval			2
as a result of this incident , the @entity8 is discussing the matter with @entity21 and letting officials know there may be further occurrences where @entity8 jets have to divert so quickly they may not be able to wait for permission			2
" we acknowledge a @entity8 aircraft veered into @entity21 airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with @entity21 authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they arise , " the @entity57 said			2
the incident was first reported by the @entity21 news agency @entity64			0
@entity11 officials did not provide any immediate reaction about the encounter			0
this was at least the second potentially - dangerous encounter between a @entity8 plane and @entity11 over the past few months			1
on april 23 , a @entity11 @entity74 fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a @entity8 @entity7 @entity19 reconnaissance plane over the @entity77 between @entity11 and @entity78 , a @entity72 official said			1
@entity11 fighter jet nearly collided with @entity8 military plane in april @entity11 and @entity8 aircraft often encounter each other , both in @entity83 as well as the area between the @entity85 and @entity86			1
but the official said the land radar activity by the @entity11 in this instance was unusual			0
the ongoing civil unrest in @entity14 and the downing of @entity92 over eastern @entity14 on july 17 , which killed all 298 people aboard , have heightened tensions between @entity95 and @entity96			0
@entity12 was brought down by a suspected missile			0
@entity99 rebels have denied allegations from @entity14 and the @entity15 that they shot down the @entity102 airliner , or that @entity11 supplied equipment used to shoot it down .			0
