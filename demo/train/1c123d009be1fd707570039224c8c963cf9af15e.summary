-- two years ago , @entity1 hit the lowest point of his life			1
the @entity4 , @entity5 , middle school music teacher was hovering dangerously close to 300 pounds and was feeling horrible			1
pain radiated in every joint in his body because of his weight			1
" i could barely bend over to tie my own shoes , " the 29 - year - old wrote on @entity13			2
if he dropped something on the floor at school , he had to ask a student to help him pick it up			2
being overweight was not always the norm for @entity1			1
he and his two siblings were slender kids , eating home - cooked meals and playing often outside			2
but that all changed after @entity1 became a sophomore in high school in august 2000			1
he quit the high school football team , and instead joined the school 's music and theater programs			1
unfortunately , the ferocious appetite he had developed as a football player did n't change			2
in just a few months , the 5 - foot , 10 - inch student had grown from 120 pounds to 200			1
@entity1 went from eating healthy meals at home to buying school lunches that consisted of @entity42 fries , pizzas and mozzarella cheese sticks			1
he would wash those greasy meals down with a 32 - ounce soda , which he would get from the school 's soda dispenser that he visited multiple times a day			1
as a teenager , he was making his own food choices , and those choices consisted of mostly junk			2
by the time he went to college in 2003 , @entity1 was obese			1
some people even called him the " @entity58 " because he would eat a @entity56 in four bites , " just to prove i could , " he said			2
after graduating college in may 2007 , he started a teaching job at @entity61 as a music teacher and choir director , and his weight only got worse			1
he was wearing @entity66 shirts and size 48 pants			2
his weight climbed to 291 pounds			1
this was the heaviest he had ever been , and he became self - conscious about it			2
the teacher dressed himself in loose trousers that stretched around his waist , and wore hefty button - up shirts that made him look like he was in his 40s rather than his 20s			1
@entity1 started secluding himself because of his lack of confidence , and turned to food for comfort			1
" being a teacher is a really hard job			2
it 's an emotional job			1
i think he found solace in eating , " said @entity1 's sister @entity84 , who is an @entity85 teacher			1
" he told me that he would eat fast food three times a day			2
he was sitting in front of the tv eating all the time			2
he would stand in front of the pantry , always looking for something to eat			2
it looked like an addiction			2
" by summer 2012 , though , @entity1 realized the lonely nights eating in front of tv were taking their toll			1
he joined a community college theater production of " @entity102			2
" he was cast as @entity103 , the short , greasy and overweight lackey of @entity105			2
a theater buff , @entity1 was enthused to get the part , but he discovered it was hard to physically keep up with the rest of the cast on and off the stage			1
during a cast party to mark the end of the show that summer , @entity1 joined his fellow actors for a friendly volleyball match			1
a few minutes into the game , he was already panting and totally exhausted			2
" i thought to myself at that moment , ' i 'm 27 and i feel like i 'm 60 ! ' " he wrote in his @entity13			0
a scary thought crossed his mind : what would he feel like when he did turn 60 ? that question nagged him after he left the party			0
he came home and decided to go on a walk around his neighborhood to get more exercise			1
he was winded within minutes			0
he knew then that he needed something to change if he wanted to start feeling his age			0
" my goal was to get to a point where i felt good , " he said			1
june 30 would become another birthday for him : the day he decided two years ago to change his life			1
he remembered a colleague from school telling him to use the elliptical because it was gentler on joints			0
@entity1 took the advice and went to the fitness center at the middle school to give it a try			1
the pedaling resistance of the elliptical was intense			0
he broke out in a sweat within minutes			0
he was n't a fan , but after spending 30 minutes working out , he decided he would give it another try the next day			1
" it took me 15 years to get to where i was			0
it was surely going to take me more than a couple of days to lose this weight			1
so i told myself to keep coming back , " he said			0
soon , @entity1 was working out on the elliptical an hour every day , even on the weekends			1
he would drive an hour from his home in @entity4 to his school 's fitness center in @entity157 just to work out			1
he also decided to cut soda out of his diet entirely			1
he replaced it with carbonated water so he could get the fizziness he loved without the empty calories			0
he changed his diet , too , cutting out simple sugars like cookies and candies			0
instead of eating fast food meals for lunch and dinner , he started cooking big breakfasts in the morning			0
he would wake up before 5 a.m. and whip up entrees like steak and eggs before jetting off to school			0
his lunches were medium - sized and his dinners were usually light , like a salad			0
everything was home cooked , something he had never attempted before			0
" the first time i went to a grocery store , i bought a piece of steak and an ear of corn and i was like , ' i can do this , ' " he said			0
" i realized cooking was fun			0
" he went from ordering nearly all his meals from restaurants to preparing 95 % of his meals at home			0
it did n't take long for him to see drastic changes in his stamina -- and his waistline			0
by december 2012 , he had slimmed down to 200 pounds , a number he had n't seen since high school			1
by january 2013 , @entity1 weighed 180 pounds			1
he was starting to feel less anxious around people			0
he began motivating his coworkers to exercise with him at school			0
he also saw big changes in the way his music and choir students interacted with him			0
they were more engaged and responsive in his class			0
he was gaining their respect			0
his family was so inspired by his dramatic weight loss that the whole clan , including @entity1 , got a gym membership near their home in february 2013			1
at the gym , @entity1 got a trainer to help him transition from a weight loss mentality to a weight maintenance mentality			1
he started lifting weights and allowed himself to eat more carbohydrates so he would have energy for his workouts			0
" he just really transformed his whole life , " @entity84 said			1
" he went from the unhealthiest person in our family to the healthiest			0
he was hiding himself , in his house , in the food , and that 's not who he is			1
" today @entity1 is down to a 32 - inch waist			1
he wears fashionable , slim - fitting shirts to show off his slender frame , which is a drastic change from his old school attire of oversized khaki slacks and bland dress shirts			0
he also lost the comb - over and started growing out his hair to accentuate his newly defined jawline			0
the trimmed body , smaller clothes and new hair revealed the 20 - something hiding underneath all that weight			1
" i can honestly say i 'm in the best shape of my life , " he said			0
his new confidence brought him to the realization that he wanted to pursue a different life path , too			0
he quit his seven - year teaching career and enrolled in @entity252 to get a master 's degree in choral conducting			2
but the beloved teacher has n't been forgotten by his students			0
his sixth , seventh and eighth graders created a @entity260 fan page for him			0
on the page , one of his students wrote : " this is a tribute to one of the greatest humans to ever grace this planet			0
@entity1 was not only a great director , but a great friend			1
he 's always there to lend a helping hand or a crappy joke , and i thought it was only right to make a group for him			2
" his newfound confidence has also affected @entity1 's acting life			1
in july , he nabbed the lead role as @entity277 in the production of " @entity279 " by @entity280			0
the dance routines and long rehearsals made it the most physically demanding role he has ever played			0
" i would not have been able to do this role if i was not as fit as i currently am , " he said			0
" i usually played characters who did little or no dancing at all			0
" for him , the key to weight loss was to stay positive			2
" you 'll be the last person to see the physical changes because of the fact that you see yourself differently than anyone else , " he said			0
the only person riding the roller coaster of your life is you			0

standing at 291 pounds , every joint in @entity1 's body hurt
he felt like he was in his 60s rather than his 20s , so he decided to lose weight
in seven months , he transformed his body , dropping *121* pounds
