the federal government may not be hit with a double whammy on top of the ongoing shutdown , as @entity5 speaker @entity4 told a group of fellow @entity8 legislators that he wo n't let the nation default on its debt , according to a @entity5 @entity8			1
@entity4 said that he 'd set aside the " @entity21 " -- that @entity12 would only bring measures up for a vote if they are backed by a majority of their caucus -- and rely on @entity17 to pass a measure to raise the nation 's debt limit , said the @entity5 member			1
this legislator attended a meeting wednesday involving @entity4 , but requested anonymity because that gathering was private			2
congressional republicans remain divided on how to structure legislation to raise the government 's borrowing level			0
and an aide to the @entity5 speaker downplayed the development , saying , " @entity4 has always said the @entity34 will not default on its debt , so that 's not news			2
" still , at least one @entity36 -- sen. @entity37 of @entity38 -- cheered the prospect of the @entity8 leader refusing to block at least this measure that president @entity42 and his fellow @entity17 strongly support			1
" this could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough , " @entity37 said in a statement			0
" even coming close to the edge of default is very dangerous , and putting this issue to rest significantly ahead of the default date would allow everyone in the country to breathe a huge sigh of relief			0
" the @entity56 @entity8 's vow comes exactly two weeks before the government is set to run out of money to cover its roughly $ 16.7 trillion debt , unless @entity59 agrees to lift the so - called debt ceiling			1
that had long been routine in @entity62 -- until recently , that is , when conservative @entity12 have pushed not to allow more borrowing without significant cuts			0
@entity4 himself wrote earlier this week in @entity67 that " there is no way @entity59 can or should pass ( a debt ceiling hike ) without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit and help get our economy moving again			1
" he accused president @entity42 of refusing to negotiate ; @entity42 and fellow @entity78 leaders have since said they are open to talks on any and all budgetary matters , but only after the government is reopened			1
yet @entity4 's comments signal that , at least on the debt ceiling issue , he 's willing to allow a vote on a measure backed by top @entity17 but not most @entity12 in his chamber -- something he 's refused to do with a @entity89 - passed measure to reopen the federal government , without any add - ons			1
chief among those @entity17 is @entity42 who , for all his strong rhetoric on ending the government shutdown , has said that avoiding a federal debt default is an even bigger necessity			1
he 's insisted @entity59 pass such a measure , as is , without tying it to anything else			0
" as reckless as a government shutdown is , an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse , " the president said in a speech thursday in @entity101 , @entity102			2
" there will be no negotiations over this			0
" @entity42 challenges @entity4 to allow ' yes - or - no vote ' on shutdown while @entity4 's comments suggest hope toward some common resolution on the debt ceiling , the government shutdown is another matter entirely			1
the two sides appeared no closer to an agreement thursday , the third day of the shutdown that comes because @entity59 failed to agree on a budget plan to send to president @entity42			1
in fact , they appeared to dig in -- insisting their approach is best and that the other was to blame for the 800,000 workers at risk of furloughs , shuttering of national parks , loss of funding for various programs and other effects of the shutdown			0
a conservative @entity8 wing has demanded that any spending measure include provisions to dismantle or defund @entity138 , which became law in 2010 and was upheld by the @entity140 last year			2
as he 's done before , @entity42 on thursday challenged @entity4 to stop what he called @entity12 " reckless " strategy of refusing to pass the " clean " spending bill -- which does n't have provisions targeting the president 's signature health care reform , the @entity138 , like several passed by the @entity8 - led @entity5 -- and instead pushing measures to fund popular programs on a one - by - one basis			1
the shutdown : personal stories from @entity34 on the edge the president said the spending initiative passed by the @entity78 - led @entity89 would pass the @entity5 with support from @entity17 and some @entity12 , except that @entity4 wo n't allow the vote			1
" the only thing that is keeping the government shut down , the only thing preventing people from going back to work , and basic research starting back up , and farmers and small - business owners getting their loans -- the only thing that 's preventing all that from happening right now today , in the next five minutes , is that speaker @entity4 wo n't even let the bill get a yes - or - no vote because he does n't want to anger the extremists in his party , " @entity42 said			1
senate majority leader @entity172 was part of the @entity78 chorus thursday , accusing @entity4 of reneging on an agreement to let the @entity5 vote on a " clean " spending package of $ 988 billion , $ 70 billion less than @entity17 wanted )			1
@entity4 went back on that deal , @entity172 surmised in an interview with @entity181 's @entity180 , because he feared fellow @entity12 would turn on him and oust him from his position as @entity5 speaker			2
" his job is not as important as our country , " @entity172 said			0
" ... he has to have some courage			0
" @entity172 jabs @entity4 , says he reneged on deal @entity189 : @entity8 should stand its ground @entity8 rep. @entity191 said thursday night that " very , very arrogant and very obstinate " remarks by @entity172 and what he calls a lack of needed leadership from @entity42 undermines the chances of reaching a deal			1
" if you 're going to be insulted ... , and if you 're going to be spoken down to , and there 's going to be this air of arrogance , you 're only going to make things worse , " @entity191 , of @entity38 , told @entity181 's @entity198			0
while @entity191 and a few other moderate republicans have backed a " clean " spending bill without @entity207 provisions , some of his colleagues in the @entity5 say the party wo n't budge from their strategy			0
rep. @entity212 of @entity213 , for one , described his caucus as " very unified " and said @entity172 and @entity42 are " confused " if they think " we 're going to fold and let them win on everything			2
" in fact , @entity5 majority leader @entity189 wrote in a memo that it 's the positions of @entity42 and other @entity17 that are " untenable			1
" @entity5 @entity12 would continue passing piecemeal funding measures for popular programs such as veterans affairs , national parks and medical research to keep up pressure on @entity17 who refuse to consider such measures in the ongoing stalemate , @entity189 's memo said			2
" while no one can predict with certainty how the current shutdown will be resolved , i am confident that if we keep advancing common - sense solutions to the problems created by the shutdown that @entity17 and president @entity42 will eventually agree to meaningful discussions that would allow us to ultimately resolve this impasse , " @entity189 said in the memo that a @entity8 source made available to @entity181			1
a conversation between two conservative @entity8 senators showed @entity12 think they can win the debate			2
in the comments caught by live microphone , tea party - backed sen. @entity245 told his @entity250 @entity8 colleague , minority leader @entity249 , that continuing to hammer @entity17 for refusing to consider @entity8 proposals would eventually succeed			1
proposal from moderates meanwhile , two moderate @entity5 members -- one @entity8 and one @entity36 -- proposed a compromise thursday that would fund the government for six months while eliminating a tax on medical devices in the health care reforms			2
@entity17 quickly rejected the idea because it would link the health care reform provision to the need to fund the government now while extending deep mandatory budget cuts they oppose for half of the new fiscal year			0
@entity8 moderates huddle as conservatives set agenda instead , @entity42 -- who canceled a trip to @entity272 and @entity273 for this weekend 's @entity275 summit because of the ongoing shutdown -- and other @entity17 have said they want to negotiate a broad budget deal that could include tax reforms and other matters			1
but they 're only willing to engage in such talks after the government reopens			0
this already slogging debate over what to do about the crisis ground to a halt thursday because of something that , at first glance , did not directly involve any of the legislators on @entity291 , even if it did hit very close to home			0
a chase that began at a @entity5 security checkpoint ended near the @entity34 @entity291 when authorities opened fire on a car containing a woman and a child , an intelligence source told @entity181			0
two police officers suffered injuries in the ordeal , according to d.c. police chief @entity305			0
the female driver -- who did n't fire any shots herself , according to multiple sources -- died of gunshot wounds			0
the @entity5 and @entity89 were both put on lockdown , with no one allowed to leave or enter @entity291 buildings and everyone urged to steer clear of windows and doorways , for about an hour			0
not long after , @entity17 and @entity12 reconvened on the @entity5 floor and , in a rare show of unanimity , thanked the responding officers			0
then they resumed their normal business -- which , if the past few weeks is any indication , meant more blame and little agreement on how to bring the government back on line .			0
