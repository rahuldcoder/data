-- yesterday , @entity1 lost to @entity2 and is out of the running			0
but today , you 'd think @entity6 goalkeeper @entity5 actually won the @entity7 on his own			1
some 1,845,345 tweets heralded @entity5 's historic game -- 12 saves in regulation , a rare feat , and one that allowed @entity6 fans to focus on a winning performance while ignoring the understory : @entity2 controlled the game from the beginning , and even the late goal by 19 - year - old @entity20 could do little to change the writing that was on the wall			1
as the weary @entity6 team trudged past the 90 minute mark , @entity23 focused on the herculean effort by @entity5 , crowing that he had more saves than @entity28 , starting a petition to rename @entity30 , and briefly appointing him secretary of defense on @entity32			1
to be sure , @entity5 's performance was one of legend , but the rapture over it , albeit well - deserved , seems to put on a @entity38 on the one simple fact of the match : the @entity23 lost			1
from the very beginning of its campaign , with its slogan of " i believe that we will win ! " ( a chant that began , appropriately enough , with @entity48 football ) the @entity23 seemed , well , relatively deluded that it could now contend with the world			0
on the upside ? the campaign convinced millions upon millions of @entity23 to finally engage in the frenzy that absorbs the rest of the globe in the world 's most popular sport			0
downside ? rather than be shocked and grateful that that the @entity23 men made it to the knockout round , many seemed to think that @entity2 would be a small hurdle to @entity6 victory			1
the focus on winning , above all else , is likely the most important factor that has driven @entity23 to pay attention , finally , to the @entity7 stages			1
but for 40 years -- 40 years -- the @entity23 did not care about the @entity7 because the @entity23 did not qualify			1
so @entity23 turned up its nose to soccer , disdaining it for generations			2
there are many reasons to think that @entity23 's disenchantment with the beautiful game is over -- obsessive interest in the first rounds of play is one of them			2
but what happens as the @entity7 packs up and moves on ? will broken - hearted @entity23 still love soccer now ? it is easy to link @entity7 mania to the popularity of youth soccer in the @entity23			1
a 2007 @entity85 study concluded that some 25 million @entity6 children play soccer , giving the @entity23 the largest youth base of any country competing in @entity90 right now			1
but after all , kids playing on a saturday morning likely does n't explain the seeming suddenness of @entity6 interest			1
and we did n't see this kind of interest back when the @entity23 hosted the tournament back in 1994			1
we also did n't see it when the @entity23 women won the whole thing in 1991 and 1999 ( because , well , you know , women 's sports and all )			1
and we did n't see it when the @entity23 men 's national team reached the quarterfinals in 2002			2
so where did all of this frenzy come from ? answer : @entity23 hate being left behind			0
@entity23 prefer to lead , and until now , they have been the only ones missing this global party , one where the @entity23 men have yet to build a winning reputation , something central to @entity6 identity			1
indeed , some think the intense focus on @entity90 has to do with this unfamiliar underdog status			0
soccer has " been a bit of a subculture for a while now , " says @entity119 , a former @entity120 player and current editor - in - chief of @entity127 " one that is incredibly vibrant , inclusive , and frankly , really fun			0
... who does n't want to be part of that ? " it 's a good point			0
down side ? " there 'll be no worse thing for @entity6 soccer than if we ultimately win a @entity7 , " says sportswriter @entity132			1
" when that happens , and when we 're on equal footing with the elites , it all becomes dull			0
" for @entity119 , though , the turning point has been that this @entity7 " opened the eyes of many of the decision makers in the media that this culture exists			2
" but it is n't just the gate - keepers			0
social media has given the @entity23 soccer nation subculture the space to crow from the rooftops their love of the game , and their enthusiasm has generated a contagion effect , building a collective excitement about soccer that 's literally spilling into the streets			1
remember that social media turned one of the worst things television has ever produced â € ” " @entity169 " â € ” into a revolutionary experience because viewers could complain , mock , and cheer all together			1
it 's done the same for the @entity7 , giving it the sense of camaraderie that sports fans need to unify around a team			0
just think : fans tweeted 15.9 million times during the first three @entity23 matches			0
during the game against @entity179 , one of the most popular images throughout the @entity182 was of companies who had brought in televisions and food so employees could watch			0
but do n't get too excited			0
this may have not legs			0
that @entity23 caught @entity7 fever does n't tell us much about how soccer as a spectator sport will fare here , particularly in terms of the popularity of @entity120 or whether @entity198 's television audience for the @entity199 will continue to grow			1
sure , the @entity23 has had diehard soccer fans of all kinds for some time now , but they are n't always rooting for those wearing the red , white , and blue			2
@entity205 , eliminated by the @entity206 on sunday , has traditionally been the most popular team in the @entity23 , selling almost twice as many tickets to its " friendly " matches as the @entity23 men 's national team , which is relatively new by comparison			0
many of the @entity23 in @entity90 are there to support @entity6 teams , representing communities like those who play at the @entity216 in @entity217 , where league and pick - up games are accompanied by food trucks slinging the best pupusas , tamales , elote on a stick , arepa , and , of course , tacos			2
and it is still hard for some @entity23 to embrace a game that does n't necessarily end when it is supposed to , and a tournament with groupings and strategies that mean a loss of yours is turned into a win because the team you tied the other day just beat someone else			2
also , many sports fans may not have space to add soccer into their seasonal cycle of baseball , football , and so on			0
thus , the appeal of the @entity7 is not necessarily the game it features , as much as the lure of the @entity23 finally sitting at the big table , qualifying regularly , and even winning a match or two			2
it is a situation somewhat akin to the @entity250 , in which @entity23 become fascinated -- and sometimes fanatical -- with curling and ice dancing and skeleton for the fortnight , but without question do n't think about it again until the next one			0
so perhaps unless @entity258 's @entity257 and @entity259 get into the next season of " @entity261 , " it might be four more years before @entity23 obsesses about them again .			0

@entity264 : @entity6 so nuts about @entity5 you 'd think he won the @entity7 himself
but craze likely wo n't last : it was more about @entity23 wanting in on the party , she says
she says the @entity7 is suited to social media camaraderie , which has helped whip up interest
after the @entity23 loss , soccer interest will probably wane , @entity264 says
