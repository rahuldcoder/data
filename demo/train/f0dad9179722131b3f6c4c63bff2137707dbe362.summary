-- on november 2 you can help raise millions of dollars for sick children by sitting on the sofa and playing video games			1
just like the weekend athletes who collect donations from family and friends for every mile they race in a charity run , thousands of gamers will be enlisting their networks to support them in a marathon of a completely different sort			1
this novel fund raising idea is sponsored by @entity15 , which is now a part of the nonprofit @entity17			1
players can sign up to play for this charity at any time throughout the year			2
but november 2 is @entity15 's annual game day			1
and because this year the day ends with clocks falling back an hour , they have upped the challenge from a 24 - to a 25 - hour marathon of gaming			1
would anyone really support gamers spending an entire day just playing ? and would gamers sign up for such a thing ? even @entity15 founder @entity29 was unsure			1
back in 2007 , he reached out to a gaming community called @entity31 to see whether they would donate a few games to @entity34 , a young girl who was going through cancer treatment in his local hospital			2
he received such an overwhelming response from gamers all over the world that he and @entity34 had to spend the next few months trying to find enough hospitalized kids to take all the games			2
@entity29 says he realized that gamers were the ideal audience for a good cause			0
here , he thought , is a group that loves trying to save the day and be the hero			0
" gamers are not the stereotype of the angry pale kid in mom and dad 's basement , " he said			0
" they are more likely to be the mom and the dad			0
" we are some of the most connected people on the planet			0
we communicate more efficiently , and we want to make a difference			0
despite these expert qualifications , nobody really asks us for our help			0
" @entity34 succumbed to her cancer in 2008 , and @entity29 started @entity15 that year in her honor			1
since then , his faith in gamers has been more than proven			0
every year thousands of new players sign up , and to date they have raised more than $ 4 million			1
are gamers really the giving type ? the argument could be made that some gamers might be signing up so they finally have an excuse to spend a whole day playing without the guilt that they 're wasting time			1
but other charities have started to tap into this audience , and they have also found a giving community			1
the charity @entity74 is celebrating its 10th anniversary of gamers giving back , and in 2012 it received more than $ 5 million in contributions			1
and then there is the philanthropy , @entity80			2
@entity80 is a unique online store that sells a rotating collection of games at a price determined by the purchaser			2
the buyer also gets to select what percentage of that price will go to the game 's developer , the @entity80 team , and how much goes to a selected charity			1
@entity80 's @entity93 and his team were nervous when they offered their first bundle in 2010			2
what would gamers do ? if they were just trying to get the lowest price possible for these games , the model would never work			0
the team hoped to raise $ 200,000 with that first offering			2
instead , they brought in more than $ 1.2 million , with about $ 350,000 of that going to charity			1
" we were totally floored to see that people were willing to give more than the minimum , " @entity93 said			0
" it changes the message that this is just a discount ... we really trust the consumer to do the right thing , and they have proven that trust , and the charity part is incredibly integral to that			0
" on humble bundle purchases , the default portion that goes to charity is 20 %			0
in most cases , @entity93 said , buyers slide that percentage up to give more to charities like the @entity125 , charity : water and the @entity127			2
to date , @entity128 has raised more than $ 25 million for charities			1
@entity29 keeps a picture of @entity34 at his desk at work as he prepares for their big marathon			0
this year he is looking to expand his gaming audience			0
@entity15 is inviting everyone who plays any type of game , whether it is sports , board games , even live - action role - playing			1
he says he believes the generous spirit he found in video gamers is a universal trait that just needs an opportunity , and perhaps the incentive to have some fun			0
that , he says , is what @entity34 showed him , from a hospital bed full of games and a determination to find a child for each one .			0

gamers can raise money by playing for more than 24 hours on november 2
@entity15 has raised more than $ 4 million since its start in 2008
the charity @entity74 marks 10 years of gamers giving back .
@entity80 gives gamers the choice to pay more to help charities
