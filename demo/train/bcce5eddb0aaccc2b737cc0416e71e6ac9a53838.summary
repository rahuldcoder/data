-- the @entity1 vowed saturday to make public a full review of its response to the deadly @entity6 outbreak in @entity7 once the crisis is under control			1
but the @entity11 health agency , which is among those leading the battle against a scourge that has claimed more than 4,500 lives in @entity7 , declined to comment on a scathing internal document , cited in an @entity18 report , describing its response as botched and riddled with incompetence			1
" nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall , " who said in the document , according to the @entity18			2
" a perfect storm was brewing , ready to burst open in full force			0
" who called the leaked document a first draft that had not been fact - checked or reviewed by its staff as part of its continuing review of the response			2
" we can not divert our limited resources from the urgent response to do a detailed analysis of the past response , " @entity1 said in a statement			1
" that review will come , but only after this outbreak is over			0
" a timeline of the outbreak showed that @entity1 missed opportunities to stop the spread of the disease after it was first diagnosed in @entity7 , the @entity18 reported			2
the document also said @entity1 experts failed to recognize that traditional containment methods would n't work in the region			1
the leaked document said that dr. @entity54 , normally in charge of polio eradication , alerted @entity1 director - general @entity57 via email in june that national health organizations and charities believed the @entity11 agency was " compromising rather than aiding " the @entity6 response			1
" none of the news about @entity1 's performance is good , " @entity54 wrote , according to the @entity18			1
according to the @entity1 , there have been more than 9,200 confirmed , probable or suspected @entity6 cases since the outbreak began months ago , with more than 4,500 deaths			1
those figures -- documenting cases in @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and the @entity78 -- likely underestimate the impact , since many cases were never diagnosed , especially in locales that are more remote , do not have a vibrant health care system or do have stigmas that may have led some not to seek treatment			1
and , authorities warn , it could get exponentially worse if the world does n't step up			0

" " we understand that in carrying out this task with the maximum preparation and efficiency , we will be protecting our people , and our brothers in the @entity122 and @entity139 , and prevent its spread , which sadly has been introduced and could spread further in the @entity78 , which has so many personal links and interchanges it maintains with the rest of the world , " said @entity127 in @entity131 , the official newspaper of the central committee of the @entity133			1
@entity127 also emphasized this is " not in search of peace between the two countries that have been adversaries for so many years , but , in any case , for world peace , an objective that can and should be sought			2
