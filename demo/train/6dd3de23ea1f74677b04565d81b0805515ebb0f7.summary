@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new restored version of " @entity4 , " one of the greatest films in the @entity7 canon , has recently been released			2
the film , which came out in 1936 , vividly captured the anxieties that gripped industrial workers at the height of the @entity12			1
unfortunately , the comedy works as well today as it did over seventy years ago , another sign that all is not well with our economy			1
in the opening scene , viewers see the @entity20 , played by @entity21 , working on an assembly line			1
many generations of viewers have laughed as they watched @entity21 try to keep up with the mind - numbing repetition of bolts that must be tightened as they make their way to him on the conveyer belt			1
whenever he or his co-workers stop , for even a second , they must frantically scramble to catch up			2
@entity21 suffers a nervous breakdown and is placed in a hospital			1
when the @entity20 leaves the hospital , he steps right into the front lines of a communist march			2
he is mistaken as one of the leaders of the protest			0
he is arrested and thrown into jail			0
the @entity20 eventually escapes during a jail break			0
much of the rest of the film follows the @entity20 and his girlfriend , the @entity49 , as they imagine a life of middle - class luxuries			1
the two break into a department store one night , experiencing what it would be like to enjoy all the new goods that were being offered in the emerging world of mass consumption			1
in one scene , the @entity60 and the gamine rest by a tree outside a nice neighborhood , watching a couple say goodbye			0
" can you imagine us in a little home like that ? " the caption reads			0
they think about what it must be like before a policeman tells them to move along			0
later , they have a chance to live their dreams , but they must do so in a broken - down shanty where the walls fall over and a wood plank keeps crashing down on @entity21 's head from the ceiling			1
" @entity4 " seems all too familiar for many @entity88 who are living through an economic nightmare in 2010			0
although working conditions for many @entity88 have vastly improved since the 1930s and citizens can count on certain basic provisions upon their retirement , current economic conditions have created the same kind of despair captured by @entity21 in this film			1
other than the upper - income @entity88 who are enjoying the fruits of a rebounding stock market , most are struggling to survive with an unemployment rate hovering at 9.5 percent ( and an underemployment rate , which includes the unemployed and those working part - time seeking full - time work , that is over 19 percent )			0
they are fearful about keeping their jobs if they have one , obtaining jobs if they do n't , being able to pay for their family 's needs , saving for retirement , and facing local and state governments cutbacks in essential services such as school programs			1
yet politicians are not dealing with this crisis and the private sector has not offered solutions			1
the problem is much deeper than the recession			0
the stagnant unemployment rates have been produced by a number of forces that have long been brewing in the economy			1
for decades , businesses have been shifting their plants overseas			0
they have been setting up shop in places where labor is cheap and unions are nonexistent			0
while much of this shift began with factory jobs , a growing number of white - collar jobs have left as well			0
the @entity88 has fallen behind in many sectors of the economy such as clean energy and is even starting to feel competition in once - dominant sectors such as science			2
public policy , as many scholars have shown , has combined with globalization to undercut the security that many @entity88 had enjoyed in the @entity153 era , at the same time that income inequality has vastly increased			0
rising medical and educational costs have squeezed the financial resources of families as they face these challenges			0
there will continue to be a debate about which are the most important factors behind the current crisis , but the outcome is indisputable			2
@entity165 is a poignant example			0
@entity165 was the woman who confronted president @entity167 when she asked , " i 've been told that i voted for a man who said he 's going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class ... i 'm waiting ... is this my new reality ? " unfortunately , @entity165 found out her answer when she was laid off by a nonprofit organization in @entity175			2
according to the national director of the organization where she worked , " it 's not anything she did			2
she got bit by the same snake that has bit a lot of people			0
it was a move to cut our bottom line			0
most not - for - profits are seeing their money pinched			0
" too many of the nation 's workers are finding themselves right back where @entity21 's character was in 1936			1
ultimately , many @entity88 did experience better lives when the @entity193 stabilized conditions and increased government spending in @entity196 helped stimulate the economy			2
innovation and public - private partnerships resulted in a vibrant period for the @entity88 economy during the 1950s and 1960s , one that the historian @entity202 has characterized as an era of " @entity204			1
" today the political system seems paralyzed in its efforts to find ways to regenerate the economy			1
as a new generation of @entity88 are exposed to the film for the first time , they might find themselves laughing a bit too hard and seeing a little of themselves in @entity21 's shoes			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity21 's 1930s film depicted anxiety of workers unable to get ahead
@entity225 says many of its themes *resonate* in today 's hard times
while workers have made progress , they remain at the mercy of economy , he says
@entity219 : politicians not dealing with crisis ; private sector has not offered solutions
