" this used to be a land of bandits , wolves and bears , " says @entity0 , surveying the countryside around ancient houses of @entity3			1
high above the barren @entity10 hills in @entity13 's central @entity12 region , this tiny hamlet , barely changed since medieval times , was in danger of reverting to its wild past until @entity0 showed up with a vision			1
" when i first got here on my motorbike , i was wandering , totally lost			2
this unspoilt place , with no traces of modernity , struck me like @entity24 on the road to @entity26 , " he says			2
@entity0 , an @entity13 - @entity27 businessman , has since made it his life 's mission to rescue such crumbling villages by turning them into high - end resorts that blend in with their surroundings			1
@entity36 ( @entity37 , @entity3 ; +39 0862 899112 ) in @entity3 is one of several so - called " diffuse hotels " that eschew the usual hotel model of grouping rooms and facilities under one roof			1
instead , @entity36 's 29 rooms , spa , wine bar , restaurant and reception lie scattered in separate buildings formerly used as barns , stables , pigsties , wine cellars and farmers ' or shepherds ' lodgings			1
@entity57 and stone cottages have been restyled as suites , the village dungeons serve as a wedding room and a former witch 's lair now hosts business meetings			1
the hotel even makes use of a medieval brothel			1
@entity3 is a maze of cobbled streets , steep stone stairs , arches , vaults , gargoyles , hidden grottoes , frescoed loggias and crumbling walls covered in ivy			1
there are also ruins -- the remains of the houses collapsed during the 2009 earthquake that rocked nearby @entity82			2
slaughtered pig @entity0 gives me the grand tour , describing his early days trying to acquire property in the hamlet -- leading to surreal situations for both him and the villagers			2
" when i knocked at people 's doors offering to buy their dwellings , they thought i was crazy , " he says			2
" once a local slaughtered a pig right in front of my eyes with @entity97 playing in the background			2
" today the village may be marginally less rustic , but @entity36 's charm lies in its sympathetic use of historic structures			1
at the reception , housed in a former donkey stable at the hamlet 's entrance where nativity scenes are staged at @entity109 , the concierge hands me the biggest and heaviest room key i 've ever encountered : 30 centimeters of pure iron			2
" that way you 'll never lose it , " she says			2
a path leads to my room -- @entity118 -- one of the closest cottages to the reception ( the farthest one lies 200 meters away )			2
i open the squeaky bolt of a heavy wooden door and enter a snug , warm room filled with the scent of embers and orange peel -- a perfume created by the hotel to evoke a typical hearth scent			1
old furniture , including a spinning wheel and museum pieces , are juxtaposed with modern sculptures and sleek , luxurious bathroom facilities			1
showering in the elegant white resin tub is an experience			2
rinsing involves using a pitcher to collect running water from a low tap , a throwback to the past			2
there 's no television , phone or minibar , but it 's not totally offline			0
there 's a powerful @entity149 signal throughout the buildings			1
bird 's nest lying back on my wrought iron king size bed , i spot an old bird 's nest among the wood ceiling beams			0
" this is what i call ' authentic ' @entity13 , " says @entity0			1
" i wanted to restyle the buildings as we found them and bring back to life the so - called secondary human heritage : that of poor , outcast communities who for centuries stood as @entity13 's shame			1
" that 's why i kept the cracks in the walls and the fireplace hearth soot : these are layers of history			0
" @entity36 is the opposite of colonialist tourism			1
clients here want to discover the village identity and mingle with locals			1
" outside , in the center of the hamlet , silence rules			0
just 50 residents still live here and , walking around , i come across elderly women sitting on doorsteps and art restorers at work			0
occasionally a passerby looks at me shyly , but greets me with a hello			0
" even when the hotel is fully booked you 'll feel on your own , " says @entity193 , who has an unusual job as @entity36 's anthropologist , collecting the village 's oral tradition and lost customs			1
while that might be great for guests , locals are n't so sure			0
" it 's one thing coming here as a visitor , and another living here " says @entity204 , owner of @entity205 , the village tavern			1
" after a while you can go nuts			0
" there are no complaints about the food though -- a mix of gourmet and traditional			0
sitting at the scarred wooden tables of the @entity218 , a large dining room 50 meters from reception , @entity216 serves me pan bagnato -- a dish of bread and vegetables -- with cured meats , lentil soup , pecorino cheese , pears and nuts			0
bloodsucking witches there 's a glass of @entity234 red wine on the table			0
evening meals are taken in @entity237 , the hotel 's grotto restaurant located on the other side of the hamlet where chef @entity241 serves a daily changing menu that includes signature dishes like ricotta cheese ravioli , pork chops and fried breaded porcini mushrooms			1
after an afternoon nap , i 'm greeted in the hotel 's tea room and craft shop by @entity251 , who sits at an old spinning frame making wool carpets , bed covers and giving weaving lessons to guests			1
she also spins a few old tales , telling me about spirits haunting the woods and witches who suck the blood of crying babies			0
she serves licorice and artichoke herbal tea alongside traditional @entity267 waffles			0
she also makes @entity268 , a sweet and sour alcoholic drink made from @entity271 roots			0
there 's a crystal bottle of @entity268 and a crackling fire waiting for me when i get back to my room in evening			0
the next morning i 'm woken by birdsong and light filtering through small , wooden - framed windows			1
breakfast is a buffet table laden with homemade yogurt , pies , ricotta cheese and a ham leg over in the restaurant			0
it 's fine to wander over there before getting ready for the day to savor one of the great treats of these hamlet hotels			1
how many other hotels offer guest the chance to stroll outside through a mountain village , taking in great views and fresh air , while wearing pajamas ? other ' diffuse ' hotels @entity299 sits among the ruins of a temple and has @entity303 dwellings spread across a @entity305 - listed historical center			1
its diffuse breakfast features the best of @entity310 's pastries			2
via @entity311 , 15 , @entity299 , @entity310 the spa area at @entity313 , a traditional farm in @entity315 , used to be a wine cellar			0
vegetables were once stacked in the romantic suite while the family suite used to be a hen house			0
