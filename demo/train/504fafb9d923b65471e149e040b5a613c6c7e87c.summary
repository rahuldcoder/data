@entity1 , @entity0 -- scientists in the @entity4 are developing a " synthetic tree " capable of collecting carbon around 1,000 times faster than the real thing			1
a conceptual design of how the " synthetic tree " might look should they ever reach the stage of production			1
as the wind blows though plastic " leaves , " the carbon is trapped in a chamber , compressed and stored as liquid carbon dioxide			1
the technology is similar to that used to capture carbon from flue stacks at coal - fired power plants , but the difference is that the " synthetic tree " can catch carbon anytime , anywhere			1
" half of your emissions come from small , distributed sources where collection at the site is either impossible or impractical , " said professor @entity25 , @entity27 professor of geophysics in the @entity28 and @entity29 at @entity30			2
" we aim for applications like gasoline in cars or jet fuel in airplanes			0
we are going after co2 that otherwise is nearly impossible to collect , " he told @entity2			0
while the idea of carbon - catchers may sound far - fetched , an early model has been built and @entity25 is in the process of writing a proposal for consideration by the @entity4 @entity51			2
he personally explained the concept in a 45 - minute meeting with @entity4 energy secretary @entity54 last month at a three - day symposium on climate change in @entity1			0
" he was there and i was there and he showed interest , " @entity25 told @entity2			0
" that 's exciting , but i do n't particularly want to discuss this in a public forum because i think this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to tailor my proposals to the @entity51 in a way that makes them more palatable			0
" @entity25 started working on the concept of an ambient carbon catcher in 1998			0
" i argued back then and i still argue that the reason this can be done , from a theoretical point of view , is that the co2 in the air is actually surprisingly concentrated , therefore the device you need to collect @entity75 is quite small			2
" the " synthetic tree " looks more like a public convenience block than a hi - tech method of reducing carbon emissions , but @entity25 told @entity2 it is highly efficient for its size when compared , for example , to a modern power - generating wind turbine			1
" if you give me one of those big windmills which have those big areas through which the rotor moves -- how much co2 can i avoid ? and if i had an equally sized @entity75 collector -- how much co2 can i collect ? it turns out the collector is several hundred times better than the windmill			0
" is the " synthetic tree " an interesting alternative , or a scientific flight of fancy that 's unlikely to happen ? sound off below			1
@entity25 told @entity2 that initial concerns over the cost of the technology were focused on the " front - end " carbon collector , including the sorbent used to catch the carbon dioxide in the air			1
but after years of research , @entity25 told @entity2 he and his colleagues have developed a sorbent that is " close to the ideal , " in that it uses a relatively small amount of energy to release the @entity75 and is not prohibitively expensive			2
" by the time we make liquid @entity75 we have spent approximately 50 kilojoules [ of electricity ] per mole of @entity75			1
" compare that , @entity25 said , to the average power plant in the @entity4 which produces one mole of co2 with every 230 kilojoules of electricity			0
" in other words , if we simply plugged our device in to the power grid to satisfy its energy needs , for every roughly 1000 kilograms [ of carbon dioxide ] we collected we would re-emit 200 , so 800 we can chalk up as having been successful , " he said			1
@entity25 told @entity2 the biggest cost was at the " back - end " of the collector , primarily the technology used to release the co2 from the sorbent			0
he said for that reason , on a cost - basis , the " synthetic tree " could not compete with modern coal - fired power plants that are designed to release fewer carbon emissions than their older predecessors			1
but he said when compared to the cost of retro - fitting an existing coal plant , the " synthetic tree " becomes more viable			1
" the bottom line is we have in this way the ability to deal with the problem at a cost which is somewhat higher than on a coal - fired power plant retro - fit , but not much higher			0
" besides , he said , the technology is not being developed as an alternative to the carbon capture and storage methods currently being tested for large - scale use on coal - fired power stations			2
he 's targeting carbon that 's already in the air			2
the concept of the " synethic tree " has caught the imagination of one of the first scientists to warn the world about global warming , @entity25 's colleague at @entity30 , @entity162 of @entity163 and environmental sciences , professor @entity165			1
" i 'm extremely excited about this			0
i think this is something that the world 's going to have to have , unfortunately , " @entity165 told @entity2 from @entity167 where he received a @entity168 for his work on the issue of climate change			1
@entity165 told @entity2 most people still do n't recognize the magnitude of the task the world faces in reducing global carbon emissions , and it was likely that one day urgent action would need to be taken , above and beyond the current measures being discussed			1
" we 're probably not going to stop @entity75 rising until it 's double what it was near - 1800 and maybe even more than that , " he said			2
" i think we will find that the planet is too warm , ice is melting too fast ... and we 'll want to bring the co2 back down again			0
the only way we can do that on a short timescale would be to pull it back out of the atmosphere			0
" @entity165 told @entity2 the units could stand in the middle of @entity195 , for example , and their presence would n't significantly disrupt the atmospheric distribution			0
" each unit would take out a ton of @entity75 a day -- which would be the amount of co2 produced by 20 average automobiles in the @entity4 and the cost of each unit would be about the cost of a @entity207			2
so that would mean if you added a five percent surcharge on automobile purchases that money could go to building units to remove the @entity75 those vehicles are going to create			0

" synthetic tree " would capture carbon dioxide in the air to reduce emissions
trapped carbon would be compressed to liquid @entity75 ready for *sequestration*
technology is being developed by scientists at @entity30 in the @entity4
@entity165 : " i think this is something that the world 's going to have to have "
