-- there 's a standard @entity3 itinerary : arrive at one of the many casinos along the @entity6 , head straight for the card tables and slot machines , drink some complimentary cocktails and proceed to empty your wallet			1
sometimes it feels like it would be easier to cut out the middleman and simply hand over your money directly to the dealer because , let 's face it , the odds are not in your favor			1
but do n't let this dissuade you from visiting @entity3			1
even if you 're not a gambler , good times can still be had in this iconic @entity28 spot , which has largely bounced back from the devastation wrought by @entity30			1
@entity3 falls somewhere in between @entity32 ' glitz and @entity34 's grime , and you can find a bit of either , depending on your taste			1
there are a myriad of eating , drinking , sightseeing and shopping options , both inside and outside the casinos			1
so venture past the slot machines and try some of the following activities to see what @entity48 truly has to offer beyond gambling			1
belly up to the bar at local watering holes sure , @entity3 's casinos offer a glut of nightclubs and ritzy bars with bottle service and pounding sound systems			1
but for a cheaper drinking experience with more character , check out the city 's local dive bars and pubs			1
many are open 24 hours for those who wish to imbibe until the sun rises			1
you might even chat with some regulars at places such as @entity70 's ( 2437 @entity69 ; 609 - 348 - 5170 ) , a pleasantly seedy establishment a few blocks off the @entity6			1
if you 're looking for some bar food to wash down your beer , try the @entity76 ( 164 st. @entity77 ; 609 - 344 - 9064 ) or @entity79 - @entity78 ( 231 s. @entity80 ; 609 - 344 - 1113 ) -- both offer wings , burgers and more , with a hearty dollop of local flavor on the side			1
pretend you 're an extra on ' @entity86 ' the knife and @entity88 ( 3600 @entity69 ; 609 - 344 - 1133 ) was a @entity90 - era speakeasy and restaurant			2
it frequently played host to a gang of colorful characters , including the real - life @entity96 ( the inspiration for the @entity102 show 's @entity100 character ) , before being raided and shut down by the feds			2
it soon reopened , and the restaurant is still going strong today , having been fully renovated and restored in 2005			2
it 's an elegant place to enjoy a steak , some seafood , a martini or two and soak in the aura of the @entity112 ' 20s			2
get curious about history if you 're in the mood to do some historical sightseeing in the greater @entity3 area , there are several interesting landmarks			1
just south of town , in @entity121 , sits @entity122 the @entity123 , a six - story high @entity124			2

learn to gamble this might seem like a cheat , but technically it 's not gambling			0
some casinos , such as the @entity245 , offer instructional lessons in their poker rooms			1
according to the casino 's faq , you can ask the shift manager to set up a free private or group lesson			0
who knows , you might learn a thing or two for when you decide to hit the tables for real			0
of course , the house does n't like to lose , so maybe hold off the high - limit tables for just a little while			0
explore beyond the tables there is plenty to do inside @entity3 's casinos besides gambling			1
take in a music or comedy show , pamper yourself at an upscale spa , eat at one of the many posh restaurants or budget buffets or embark on an epic shopping spree			0
if consumerism is your preferred method of relaxation , you 've come to the right place			0
the @entity274 at the @entity275 is an @entity277 - themed cluster of shops , restaurants and nightlife , nostalgically hearkening back to the days of @entity281			0
the @entity282 at @entity230 is another area where you can spend a few hours away from the casino floor eating , shopping or watching @entity286 , a vegas - style water , light and sound extravaganza that pops off once every hour ( check with the hotel first , it is occasionally out of service )			0
walk the @entity6 finally , take a leisurely stroll down the entire length of the @entity6 , a tourist attraction that dates back to the late 1800s			0
on one side lies the @entity297 , stretching out behind the dunes and grass , and on the other are countless casinos , stores , novelty shops and fast - food joints			1
this summer , free events such as a concert by country singer @entity307 ( july 31 ) and @entity309 pro volleyball ( september 5 - 7 ) will take place along the @entity6			0
settle in for some serious people watching			0
a diverse mass of humanity descends every summer , from @entity316 - @entity315 parades to teenage skaters to extended families from @entity319 , all enjoying the sea air perfumed by the scent of fried dough and cotton candy .			0
