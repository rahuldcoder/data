@entity1 votes wo n't be cast until 2016 , but the next @entity4 occupant will have an extremely busy 2015			1
a flurry of official entrances into the race could come this spring -- with all eyes on @entity9 on the @entity11 side , and @entity12 looking at a wide - open field that includes more than a dozen potentially viable candidates			1
and much of the action will take place in the first two states to vote : @entity18 and @entity19			1
many of the events on 2015 's calendar will be familiar : conservatives will flock to major conferences			1
the @entity25 will draw a huge crowd			0
the first debates will be major events			2
but presidential election cycles are " almost unique , " said @entity30 , a former @entity18 @entity31 co-chairman and the chief of staff to two of the state 's @entity12 governors			1
the 2016 cycle , @entity30 said , " is well underway			2
it 's almost all under the radar			0
" many contenders visited @entity18 to campaign for @entity12 @entity42 candidate @entity41 in 2014 -- and did some outreach and organizing while they were there , he said			1
" there are a lot of phone calls that are being made among @entity18 activists , and certainly into the state -- some from the candidates or would - be candidates , and others from people who are helping them , " he said			1
" we 've been in the somewhat invisible primary -- the activist organizing stage , etc. , for some time now , " said @entity54 , a @entity19 @entity55 who co-chaired @entity57 's campaigns and is backing @entity9 in 2016			1
here 's a look at some of the key events and dates on 2015 's calendar : jan. 15 : an unofficial @entity57 decision			1
that 's the date pro-clinton aides and confidants have long said that if she 's not running , she 'll make that clear -- at least privately			0
otherwise , @entity11 could be in a tough position , with the field effectively frozen and no clear alternative emerging in the early polls			0
outside infrastructure like the group @entity78 are also making plans into 2015 , but no other candidate has any comparable backing			0
jan. 23 - 24 : the @entity82 confab			2
@entity83 sen. @entity82 will host his fourth annual " @entity88 " gathering at the @entity85 on @entity87 's @entity86 -- this time , with a huge decision to make : is he running for president ? the meeting will give @entity82 a chance to take stock of how deeply former @entity83 gov. @entity95 's own steps into the race will cut into the senator 's home - state donor base -- including right - leaning @entity99 who could have been angered by president @entity102 's move to ease tensions with the communist country			1
it 's also crucial in putting together the infrastructure @entity82 would need for a national campaign			0
the inaugural event organized by rep. @entity110 and the conservative group @entity111 will feature at least eight prospective @entity31 presidential candidates who will speak with grassroots activists from across the state			1
on the guest list so far : @entity117 gov. @entity116 , @entity119 sen. @entity118 , former @entity121 gov. @entity120 , former @entity123 sen. @entity122 , @entity119 gov. @entity124 , businessman @entity125 and businesswoman @entity126 , and @entity127			0
@entity129 gov. @entity128 has said he might attend , as well			0
feb. 25 - 28 : @entity130			2
@entity31 presidential hopefuls will flock to the annual @entity130 -- known as just " cpac " -- to court their party 's ideological grassroots			1
the conference has also offered a window into the debates riling conservatives			0
in 2011 , the participation of the pro-gay rights group @entity140 and the invitation of then - @entity143 gov. @entity142 , who had called for a " truce " on social issues , sparked boycotts from conservatives who are focused on just those policies			2
the conference has also been criticized for taking a libertarian turn , with @entity119 rep. @entity152 winning its 2010 and 2011 straw polls			0
it could be a particularly important barometer for @entity157 sen. @entity156 , who won the 2014 @entity130 straw poll and has since sought to increase @entity12 ' outreach to minority voters and smooth over his divisions with the @entity31 establishment			2
march 9 - 13 : @entity164 's 50th anniversary			2
commemorating the @entity164 - to - @entity166 voting rights march , and the police beatings of protesters it included , has long drawn presidents and @entity4 hopefuls to @entity172			1
this year 's 50th anniversary will be no different			2
march 19 : @entity57 's last scheduled paid speech			0
the lone heavyweight in the @entity11 presidential field is scheduled to deliver a paid speech to the @entity178 on march 19 -- the last one currently on her calendar			2
the date itself is n't all that meaningful : @entity9 's presidential campaign plans are unlikely to be stalled by the @entity178			1
she could call off the event , or send @entity57 instead			0
or , she could still schedule more paid speeches , especially if she does n't want to enter the race until the spring			2
still , those looking for signs of @entity57 's plans will watch to see whether the current timing of her last paid speech moves in either direction			0
it 's a must - visit for presidential candidates looking to mix and mingle with a broad swath of voters			1
the @entity197 , @entity18 's most important newspaper , will have what @entity199 called a " massive presence " at the state fair -- including the @entity203 , where candidates will make appearances , deliver stump speeches and take questions			1
the 11 - day fair will see visits from a candidate a day , and sometimes more			2
for a non-binding gut check of conservatives , this summer - before - the - caucuses tradition gets a lot of attention			2
thousands of @entity216 -- as well as candidates , political operatives and journalists -- have historically descended on the @entity221 campus , where they 're courted by campaigns that see the event as an early test of their organizational strength in the state that kicks off the nominating process			2
however , the straw poll has n't predicted much in recent years			0
in 2011 , @entity232 rep. @entity231 won , with @entity119 rep. @entity152 landing a close second -- though both had faded by the time the elections rolled around			0
in 2007 , @entity236 won the straw poll , but former @entity121 gov. @entity120 won the actual @entity18 caucuses			1
there 's also the question of whether the straw poll will continue in its previous form			0
some conservative groups have pushed to eliminate it , or at least make major changes			0
@entity18 gov. @entity245 commented in 2012 that the straw poll has " outlived its usefulness			1
" still , @entity31 operatives say it 'll likely take place in some form in 2015			0
the straw poll was held in early august 2011			0
the date has n't yet been set for 2015 , but it 'd likely come shortly after the state fair			1
fall : state party dinners			1
most campaigns ' top donors will come from out of the early - voting states , but they 'll need as much of the local party infrastructure in their corners as possible			1
in @entity18 , for example , @entity12 will flock to the state @entity31 's fall dinner			1
" that 's where the activists and donors show up all at one time			0
by that time you better have your campaign rolling and your organization well underway , " @entity30 said			0
in @entity19 , the state @entity11 's annual @entity271 dinner and its @entity274 dinner would be big opportunities for candidates not named @entity9			1
" if you 're less well known than @entity9 , scoring a speaking engagement at one of those two big dinners , which are populated by activists , would be a big deal for anybody , " @entity54 said			1
@entity18 's 99 counties and @entity19 's 10 counties will also offer candidates lower - profile speaking opportunities			1
late 2015 : the debates			0
national republicans have tried to winnow what during the 2012 election cycle seemed like an unending string of debates			0
but the debates will still happen , they 'll be televised nationally , and they 'll present candidates with opportunities to grab media attention -- for better or , as @entity119 gov. @entity124 learned when he forgot the name of the third federal agency he wanted to abolish during one debate , for worse			0
the @entity302 and the @entity19 @entity303 at @entity304 co-host these regular @entity19 events			1
candidates typically speak for about 15 minutes , and then take questions			0
dates for 2015 appearances have n't yet been announced -- but a spate of presidential contenders are all but certain to be added to the schedule in the coming months			1
" that is a real tradition			0
virtually everybody that has run for president has spoken at one or more of those over the years , " @entity54 said			0
" my guess is that will really heat up after the new year , and that 's a great way to meet a crowd that 's not a typical political crowd -- it 's bipartisan , heavy on business people and education and non-profit types and students			0

the coming year will be *jam* - packed with ca n't - miss events for 2016 presidential hopefuls
the key events include activists ' *conventions* , state party dinners and even state fairs
many of the most important events will take place in @entity18 and @entity19
