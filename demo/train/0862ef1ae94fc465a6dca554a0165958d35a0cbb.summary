-- the @entity1 , a division within the @entity2 , was a troubled agency long before the oil spill in the @entity4 and the recent revelations of employee misconduct			1
the agency -- which oversees @entity8 offshore drilling , including the @entity4 -- has come under fire for mismanagement , questionable conduct and cozy relationships with industry officials			0
the @entity1 issued permits for the @entity16 drill rig -- contracted by @entity17 -- which exploded on april 20			1
the explosion killed 11 people and resulted in an oil spill that is threatening parts of the @entity4			0
@entity2 secretary @entity22 , during an appearance wednesday before the @entity24 , said he was trying to change the agency 's culture and its structure , which some critics say leads to mismanagement			1
" my belief is that most of the employees of the @entity1 are good public servants , " @entity22 said			1
he , however , acknowledged some of the past conduct was " scandalous " and " reprehensible			0
" @entity22 said some people have been fired and others referred for prosecution			1
two sources told @entity0 on thursday that @entity1 director @entity38 has been fired			1
at a @entity24 subcommittee hearing thursday , @entity22 insisted @entity38 had resigned " on her own terms and own volition			1
" president @entity43 later said he did n't know whether @entity38 was fired or resigned on her own			1
the @entity43 administration has said in recent weeks that many of the problems within the @entity1 were inherited from the @entity48 administration			1
@entity22 , during his testimony and in his answers to members of @entity53 on wednesday , also made that point			1
during the hearing , rep. @entity55 , @entity56 , asked @entity22 why he and other officials were " harping on what @entity1 did or did n't do in the previous administration			1
" " why are n't we talking about the here and now ? " @entity55 asked			0
@entity22 was blunt in his response			1
" we 've done a lot to clean the house at @entity1 , unlike the previous administration , " he said			1
" this is not the candy store of the oil and gas kingdom which you and others were a part of			0
" conflict of interest ? the @entity1 , which has about 1,700 employees , has two responsibilities when it comes to industries such as oil or natural gas			2
it must act as a regulator while also collecting royalties from the companies			0
some critics say those are opposite pulls and make the agency ripe for mismanagement			0
the @entity8 government technically owns resources such as the oil in the @entity4			0
companies pay the federal government for the rights to drill in certain areas			2
the @entity1 collects and distributes about $ 13 billion a year , @entity22 said			1
@entity91 of the @entity92 said there is a built - in conflict of interest , resulting in lax regulation of involved companies			0
" the @entity1 has a lot of incentive to collect as much , in the way of royalty income , as it can			2
that means pressure to authorize a lot of drilling and then to do everything possible [ to make sure ] that the flow of production is robust and unimpeded , " said @entity91 , who recently wrote a piece critical of the @entity1 for @entity104 magazine			2
" @entity1 , as it is currently structured , has to simultaneously put one foot down hard on the gas pedal and the other on the brake , " he said			2
" and the imperatives to go fast are a lot stronger than to slow down			0
" @entity22 said organizational change within the mms and a restructuring of the agency was necessary to deal with such conflicts			1
@entity22 advocated plans to " remove revenue collectors away from the leasing and policing functions of the @entity1			1
" he then wants to create two bureaus within the @entity1			2
one would be responsible for creating energy resources -- including oil and gas -- in the outer continental shelf			0
it would issue leases and collect royalties			0
the other would act as the policing arm of the agency , carrying out inspections and enforcing regulations			0
' misconduct , management and spills ' " @entity1 used to stand for @entity1			2
it now stands for misconduct , management and spills , " said rep. @entity143 , @entity144 , during the @entity24 hearing wednesday			0
a report released this week from the inspector general 's office at the @entity2 revealed federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the @entity4 accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored			1
the report said all the events detailed in it occurred before 2007			2
in one case , an inspector in the @entity1 office in @entity162 , @entity163 , conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company , the report said			1
others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil , with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in			0
the report also alleged employees at the same office received tickets to 2005 @entity180 football game from an offshore production company			2
the report also includes a confidential source informing investigators that a @entity1 inspector abused drugs , including crystal meth			1
in 2008 , during the waning months of the @entity48 administration , @entity189 , then the @entity2 's inspector general , issued a report condemning the behavior of some of the agency 's employees			1
" the single-most serious problem our investigations revealed is a pervasive culture of exclusivity , exempt from the rules that govern all other employees of the federal government , " the report said			1
the report said , between 2002 and 2006 , some of the staff received gifts from oil and gas companies with whom they were conducting business			2
some of the more salacious charges in the report included substance abuse and sexual relationships with industry contacts			0
' the revolving door ' meanwhile , sen. @entity216 , @entity217 , focused on the " revolving door " between industry and government			0
the " revolving door " refers to people who work in areas such as the oil industry , move to a government agency such as the mms and then return to the private sector			2
@entity216 proposed legislation that would have federal oil industry regulators wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate			0
among other things , the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies			0
it also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies , and prohibit them from part - time employment in the industry			0
it is time , @entity216 said wednesday on the @entity246 floor , to " stop this cozy , incestuous relationship between the oil industry and the regulators			0
" @entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity254 's @entity253 contributed to this report .			0
