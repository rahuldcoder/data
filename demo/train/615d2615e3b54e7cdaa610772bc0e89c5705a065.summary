-- @entity1 knows how to stay in the spotlight			2
and for a politician who 's sitting on the sidelines , possibly waiting to make his next move , staying in the spotlight is smart politics			0
some out - of - office politicians write books , some host cable tv or radio talk shows or serve as pundits			1
@entity1 's following a different playbook			2
the former @entity15 senator from @entity16 , who recently moved to @entity18 and is considering a @entity20 challenge this year to @entity22 sen. @entity21 , is once again in the headlines			1
@entity1 jammed on stage this past weekend at a concert in @entity26 , @entity16 , with longtime rock group @entity27 , joining the band in playing " surrender , " one of its biggest hits from the 1970s			1
" hope you all enjoy this as much as i did , " he said in a @entity32 post , which links to the @entity34 video of @entity1 singing and playing guitar			2
the story played across @entity18 and @entity16 , and grabbed some national coverage as well			1
this was the second high - profile jam session for @entity1 , who started to play guitar about year ago			2
in december , he rocked with his daughter , @entity44 , of " @entity46 " fame , and @entity47 on the former @entity49 governor and 2008 @entity20 presidential candidate 's @entity51 program			0
a few weeks ago , @entity1 made the front page of the " @entity54 , " @entity18 's largest newspaper , as he stripped down to his bathing suit for the annual @entity58 plunge at @entity59			1
the event raises money for the @entity62			0
@entity1 famously stripped down years before , as a @entity64 centerfold during his years as a law school student			0
from the @entity66 to @entity67 in january 2010 , the little - known @entity20 state senator in @entity16 pulled an upset in a special election to serve the final three years of the late @entity22 sen. @entity72 's term			1
@entity1 lost his 2012 re-election bid to @entity22 challenger @entity74			0
since leaving @entity67 , @entity1 took an on - air contributor gig at @entity51 , served as a colonel in the @entity78 's office at the @entity79 , and is an attorney at the global law firm of @entity82 , which has offices in @entity84			2
last year , he passed on running in a special election in @entity16 to fill the term of @entity87 , who left the @entity88 to become secretary of state			1
and at the time , @entity1 also announced that he would n't make a 2014 bid for an open governor 's seat in the @entity16			1
@entity1 last year made a number of speaking appearances at @entity20 events in the @entity18			1
and last fall , in another hint about a possible run for the @entity88 in @entity18 , @entity1 dropped the ' ma ' from his @entity99 handle			1
a few months later , he sold his home in the @entity16 and moved his residency north to @entity18			1
a brand name @entity1 's well known in @entity103 , which gives him many advantages			2
" he can be an undeclared candidate and make news			0
he does n't need to build his name @entity106 , " a @entity20 strategist who 's been in contact with @entity1 told @entity0			2
" that gives him the luxury to wait longer than a new and unknown candidate			0
he already has a brand name and has the ability to raise resources to launch a campaign , " the strategist said			0
@entity118 , a @entity20 strategist and communications director for the @entity120 the past two election cycles , said @entity1 's cementing his image as a regular guy			2
" the main reasons candidates announce early is to raise money , boost name @entity106 and to have an edge in their party 's primary			0
but @entity1 already enjoys the unique position where those are n't necessarily major factors if he decides to run in a state with a late september primary and where he 's already well - known and well - liked among many @entity18 voters , " @entity131 said			1
@entity1 's strong name @entity106 is definitely a plus , but it also may be a minus			2
after a couple of outside conservative groups ran tv commercials in support of @entity1 , @entity21 started fundraising off the threat of a @entity1 entry into the race			0
and some outside @entity146 groups targeted @entity1 , including the @entity147 , which went up with attack ads , charging that he 's a favorite of the @entity151 crowd			2
will @entity1 run ? the strategist in contact with @entity1 , who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely , says @entity1 's looking to make a decision about a @entity88 bid in the next few weeks			1
" i think he understands the opportunity in 2014 to win , but he 's facing a number of family concerns that are weighing on this decision			0
i think he is genuinely conflicted and he first needs to figure out if he has the ability to run a political campaign given the family concerns			0
among those concerns is his mother 's in declining health			0
plus , he 's helping to plan two weddings right now , as both of his daughters are getting married this summer , " the source said			0
some @entity18 republicans who at first did n't take @entity1 's flirtations seriously have changed their minds			1
" i 've gone from a skeptic to a convert on the possibility of a @entity1 candidacy			0
he appears to be considering this race very seriously , which clearly makes sen. @entity21 and her team nervous			0
his favorable poll numbers plus the activist encouragement he is receiving only helps , " @entity20 strategist @entity181 told @entity0			0
" either way , voters hope he decides soon as they 're anxious for the primary field to be set , with other @entity20 candidates out there working hard , " added @entity181 , who was a senior adviser for @entity185 's 2012 presidential campaign			0
as @entity1 continues to mull his options , @entity0 has confirmed he will speak next month at the @entity193 , a high - profile event in @entity18			1
this latest move keeps @entity1 in the spotlight , and sparks more speculation he 'll run for @entity88			1
