while he awaits the next legal steps in the death of @entity4 student @entity3 , @entity0 appeared in court friday to answer charges on another case -- an alleged abduction , sexual assault and attempted murder from nearly a decade ago			1
during a brief appearance at the @entity12 in northern @entity13 , @entity0 only uttered two words -- " not guilty " -- to all three charges related to the september 2005 incident			1
judge @entity17 set a trial date of march 9			1
the trial is expected to last six or seven days			2
authorities say that on september 24 , 2005 , a 26 - year - old woman was returning from a grocery store in the city of @entity24 when someone grabbed her from behind and sexually assaulted her			2
" we saw her purse on the front sidewalk , " said neighbor @entity26			0
" he had already dragged her behind our units to the dark pool area			0
" the @entity33 would say later that " the offender was scared away by a passerby			0
" it was n't until last month that a @entity12 grand jury indicted @entity0 in that case			1
the october 20 indictment came two days after authorities found what turned out to be @entity43 's skull and bones on an abandoned property eight miles from where the @entity4 sophomore was last seen			2
the 18 - year - old @entity43 went missing before dawn on september 13 after being last spotted on several surveillance cameras in @entity51 's @entity50 area			0
surveillance video and other accounts led authorities to identify @entity0 as the suspect in her disappearance			1
@entity0 was taken into custody september 24 on a beach in @entity59 , @entity60 , about 1,300 miles away from where @entity43 was last seen			1
the victim in the 2005 case was able to provide enough of a detailed description to yield a police sketch			1
years later , that information would link @entity0 to the case of another missing young woman -- @entity69 , a @entity70 student who vanished in @entity51 in october 2009 and was found dead a few months later			1
prosecutor : victim will fly from @entity73 to testify at friday 's court hearing , lawyers for the 32 - year - old @entity0 waived the hearing of the charges against him			1
but according to the indictment in the 2005 case , he " did feloniously , willfully , deliberately , intentionally and with premeditation attempt to kill ( the victim ) in the commission of or subsequent to an abduction with the intent to defile			1
" the woman now lives in @entity73 and is prepared to fly to the @entity88 to testify in the upcoming trial , @entity12 @entity86 's attorney @entity85 told reporters friday			2
" this is a difficult process for anyone , and for us to step back into her life so many years later ( can be very difficult ) , " @entity85 said of the woman , who was 26 at the time of the attack			0
" i know that she is grateful ... i 'm just so pleased that she is cooperating			0
and she has just been really a saint to me			0
" in addition to the victim 's potential testimony , the @entity33 also said it has dna evidence in the case			2
lawyer seeks sanity test for @entity0 one of @entity0 's lawyers late last month tried to introduce a motion late seeking a sanity evaluation for his client			1
but a judge cut defense attorney @entity114 short , saying that motion could be filed and considered later , once a judge was permanently assigned to the case			0
@entity114 was n't in court friday , and there was no mention then of another mental evaluation request			0
@entity0 is charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the @entity43 case			1
he has not yet been charged in the 2009 case			2
analysts say he may be tried first in @entity12 , because authorities there have had more time to build their case , and they have potential eyewitnesses in addition to the dna evidence			0
speaking about the timing of the two cases , prosecutor @entity85 said that " on a personal level , i 'd like to get it going thinking about my victim			0
... on the other hand , i recognize the situation and i 'm totally flexible			0
whatever the right to do is , that 's what we 'll do			0

@entity0 pleads not guilty to abduction , sexual assault and attempted murder
his trial in that 2005 case should start in march ; the alleged victim should testify
@entity0 also is charged in the case of @entity3 , who was found dead last month
