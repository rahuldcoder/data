@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday reinstated a federal ban on gun possession for people previously convicted of certain domestic violence misdemeanors			1
justice @entity7 wrote the opinion for the 7 - 2 majority			1
the 7 - 2 vote was authored by justice @entity7 , who read a portion of the ruling from the bench in a strong , steady voice			1
it was her second day on the bench after undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery february 5			0
the opinion was a defeat for gun rights supporters , who had challenged groups fighting domestic violence over which ex-felons should be allowed to buy and keep firearms			1
at issue was whether a federal law blocking gun possession for those convicted of a " misdemeanor crime of domestic violence " should apply as well to someone convicted of a general misdemeanor , such as simple battery , which may have been committed against a spouse , child , or other relative			2
the ambiguity in the federal language and whether it could be applied retroactively was at the heart of the legal debate			2
" @entity42 sought to apply the firearm ban to all persons convicted of domestic - violence offenses , whether or not their [ state ] statutes of conviction happen to contain a domestic - relationship element , " wrote @entity7 , who said the rule could be applied retroactively			1
the case involves @entity51 , who pleaded guilty in a @entity53 court in 1993 to a misdemeanor battery charge for slapping his then - wife @entity55 with his hand during an argument			1
the conviction led to a year of probation			0
more than 10 years later , police responded to a 911 call of a domestic assault occurring at the home @entity51 shared with his girlfriend			0
deputies responded and , in a search of the house , found an unloaded @entity69 rifle under @entity51 ' bed			0
@entity51 was charged with obstruction for lying about whether a gun was in the home , and with domestic battery , another misdemeanor			2
the battery charge was eventually dropped , but the federal firearms violation stuck			0
his lawyers claim he could not be convicted in federal court of the weapons violations because the original state conviction did not include a domestic relationship element			2
only 17 states had misdemeanor domestic violence provisions when @entity42 passed the @entity85 in 1996			0
@entity53 , like many states before and since , often prosecuted such cases as simple assault or battery			0
crimes classified as felonies automatically trigger the gun possession ban			2
a federal appeals court ruled for @entity51			2
the high court in november 's oral arguments had criticized the language of the federal law , which justice @entity98 lamented was a " mess			1
" in dissent , chief justice @entity100 and justice @entity101 , found the federal law ambiguous at best , as it applied to the various state statutes on domestic violence			1
" an individual should not go to jail for failing to conduct a 50 - state survey or comb through legislative history , " wrote @entity100			1
" ten years in jail is too much to hinge on the @entity112 of statutory meaning pursued by the majority			0
" the @entity7 - led majority , however , agreed with the government 's position that @entity42 clearly wanted to include misdemeanor battery in domestic relationships , even if an abuser was not specifically convicted of that offense			1
gun rights groups say the amendment championed by sen. @entity124 , a @entity126 @entity125 , was the first time gun ownership was prevented because of a misdemeanor conviction			0
" why are men with clean histories except for one domestic dispute punished like hardened criminals who mug strangers on the street ? " wrote @entity129 for the conservative @entity130 , which filed a legal brief with the high court supporting @entity51			1
" the answer is that the feminist agenda calls for domestic - violence laws to punish husbands and fathers above and beyond what can be proven in court under due - process procedures			1
" but opponents said the names of thousands of dangerous abusers could be purged from mandatory federal criminal background checks if the law is diluted			0
" the @entity2 should follow the will of @entity42 and protect domestic violence victims and law enforcement officers who risk their lives stopping abusers , " said @entity152 , head of the @entity153 to @entity154			0
" we should not make it easier for dangerous abusers to get firearms			0
