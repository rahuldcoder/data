" heroes " lives : @entity1 helped kickstart the superhero tv trend in 2006 with " heroes , " an @entity5 - ish action - drama about a group of people with superhuman powers			1
now the network is bringing back the show for a 13 - episode event series to air in 2015			1
original series creator @entity13 is on board to run the show			1
titled " @entity18 , " the project is billed as a stand - alone story ; the characters have not yet been announced			1
" the enormous impact ' heroes ' had on the television landscape when it first launched in 2006 was eye - opening , " said @entity22 president @entity21			2
" shows with that kind of resonance do n't come around often and we thought it was time for another installment			2
we 're thrilled that visionary creator @entity13 was as excited about jumping back into this show as we were and we look forward to all the new textures and layers @entity36 plans to add to his original concept			2
until we get closer to air in 2015 , the show will be appropriately shrouded in secrecy , but we wo n't rule out the possibility of some of the show 's original cast members popping back in			1
" the news seems to echo @entity46 rebooting its action franchise " 24 " for a limited series to launch this may , though @entity1 has long been fond of recycling prior tv hits â€” there have been short - lived new version of " @entity53 , " " @entity54 , " " @entity55 , " and the network had also developed ( but not aired ) new editions of " @entity58 " and " murder she wrote			0
" reviving " heroes , " which was canceled four years ago , might be met with some mixed feelings by the show 's fans , however			0
the show got off to a strong start in both ratings and acclaim ( averaging 14.5 million viewers its first season ) , then was widely considered to have creatively collapsed into a confused muddle and became a serialized tv cautionary tale			0
but with broadcast drama tv ratings on the decline , networks are increasingly turning to event series to grab attention , and brands that were cancelled years ago now seem like potential hits even if they only deliver a large percentage of their previous audience			0
plus , " heroes " performed well on dvd , having sold more than 10 million units			0
" heroes " might be coming back onto a field with plenty of competition , depending on how many current superhero projects get renewed or greenlit			1
there 's the @entity93 's @entity92 , its spinoff @entity95 , @entity46 's @entity97 prequel in the pipeline gotham and @entity100 's @entity99			0
