-- what could be bigger than the appointment of the first female minister in @entity4 ? @entity4 @entity5 made more than one noteable appointment to his council of ministers			1
possibly the appointment of a new minister of justice who may actually help her get equal rights with her male counterpart			2
right now , @entity13 , the new deputy minister for women 's education , is bound by the same laws as every other woman in the land			1
she can do only what her closest male relative permits			0
for many women of her status and education , that law is interpreted liberally , but for the vast majority , it is not			2
over the weekend , at a single stroke , @entity5 set @entity4 on what appears to be an irreversible new course , one of modernization			1
he replaced the conservative ministers of justice and the head of the @entity34 with people closer to his way of thinking			1
the king also appointed a new head of the central bank , @entity41 -- widely seen by financial experts as a wise move -- and brought in young blood and fresh ideas to the @entity46 , the closest thing the country has to a parliament			2
that these changes happened should not be a surprise			0
since he took over as king in august 2005 , when his ailing half - brother @entity53 died , @entity5 has been working quietly to bring about change			0
indeed , @entity55 used to lead the king 's @entity56 , a sort of talking shop that allowed issues such as women 's rights to be debated			2
the hope was that as discussions about change bubbled up in national and regional arenas , they would also filter out to newspapers and onto television			0
it 's exactly what 's been happening			0
the king is well into his 80s and inherited many ministers and other top officials almost as old as him			0
many had been in their posts for decades , and many , unlike the king , held their conservative upbringings more than half a century ago to be models for the country 's future			2
so when a judge recently upheld the marriage of a 47 - year - old man to an 8 - year old - girl , there was a public backlash			0
why ? because debate about this issue had percolated into the public arena			0
and suddenly the judge looked out of step with society			0
it 's not what made the king decide to replace the minister of justice ; it just highlights how his steady behind - the - scenes work has helped him outflank the sizeable conservative segment of @entity4 society			1
what the king and many of his fellow royals have realized for a long time is that no country is an island , least of all one as rich and prosperous as @entity4			2
the kingdom 's large and rapidly growing young population watches satellite tv , surfs the @entity111 and chats on @entity112 with friends in @entity114 , and it expects a different future than the one currently on offer			1
the sweeping changes remove some of the ministers most likely to hold back the next generation			0
the old promotion of @entity121 and prevention of vice commission head , who runs the religious police , is an example			1
he has been replaced with someone closer to the king 's thinking , according to a deputy minister i talked with			1
the religious police patrol shopping malls and streets , enforcing religious laws such as ones requiring women to keep their heads covered and refrain from talking to men who are n't their relatives			1
they rile the youngsters who strain for more freedom			0
but no one is expecting revolutionary change overnight			0
@entity4 is not about to become a " permissive society			2
" religious law , long - held customs and deep religious principles are not up for negotiation			0
after all , the @entity4 king derives respect and authority from his role as " guardian " of @entity155 's two holiest sites , @entity156 and @entity157			1
to be less than thoroughly religious would not wash , even with @entity4 's moderates			1
@entity5 is calculating that he is making change at a pace people can cope with			0
on a recent visit to a shopping mall where religious police had taken a back seat for the past year , it seemed to me the octogenarian king is just about keeping up			1
the religious police were in the background , and among young girls in particular , headscarves were gone and lipstick was in bright abundance .			1

with minister picks , king appears to have put @entity4 on a new course
woman at education post is kingdom 's first female minister
conservative justice minister , head of religious police have been replaced
