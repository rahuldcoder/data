" as the @entity1 launched air strikes against @entity89 and @entity4 targets in october 2001 , @entity2 emerged as the voice of @entity4 , recording one video message in which he said : " the @entity4 organization declares that @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 are the arch - criminals from among the @entity136 and @entity137			1
" and in a later statement , published in 2002 , he said : " we are continuing with our blows against the @entity1 and the @entity118 , and with attacking them , both people and installations [ so as to stress ] that what awaits the @entity1 will not , @entity145 willing , be less than what has already happened to them			0
@entity1 must prepare itself ; it must go on maximum alert			0
" in the same statement he said : " the @entity1 have still not tasted from our hands what we have tasted from theirs ... we have ( the ) right to kill four million @entity1 , " including with chemical and biological weapons			0
one @entity156 detainee interviewed after being transferred home from @entity76 said he and @entity2 had spent time in @entity8 's company after the beginning of the @entity1 bombing offensive in @entity79 in october 2001 before traveling with @entity4 's leader to @entity9			1
