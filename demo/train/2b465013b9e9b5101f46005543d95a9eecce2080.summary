-- not so long ago , tv shows like " @entity2 , " " wonderfalls , " " terminator : the @entity10 " and " @entity11 " were mourned by science fiction fans as having been canceled before their time , due -- as it always is -- to low ratings			1
another thing each had in common : they aired on @entity14 on friday nights			2
so observers of the tv world were surprised thursday to learn of the network 's renewal of the series " @entity21 " for a full fourth season after two months in a friday timeslot			1
adding to the surprise : it was picked up in march , much earlier than many other shows with " on the bubble " status -- an equal chance of cancellation or renewal -- would traditionally find out their fates			2
( one week earlier , @entity34 renewed two of its " on the bubble " series with a passionate fanbase : " community " and " @entity39			1
" ) fans and many tv critics feared that the show 's cancellation was imminent when it was moved from a thursday slot to friday			1
despite encouraging words from @entity14 , fans rallied support for the show on social media , and star @entity51 even got involved , reminding the " @entity21 " faithful not to rest on their laurels			1
the show 's ratings started out on par with what they were on thursday but then started to drop , eventually hitting a series low six days before it was renewed , which begs the question : did fan support and other factors count for more than the show 's raw viewership ? @entity14 's news release announcing the pick - up of the show , about a war between an alternate universe and our own , certainly gave the fans plenty of credit			1
" the series ' ingenious producers , amazingly talented cast and crew , as well as some of the most passionate and loyal fans on the planet , made this fourth - season pickup possible , " said the network 's entertainment president , @entity72			1
" ultimately , i think @entity14 is making a decision not based purely on ratings but based on ( fan ) commitment and dedication , " said @entity82 , editor and creative director of @entity84 , who is contributing a chapter to an upcoming book examining the science behind the series			1
" this is an unprecedented level of support for a show with a small but dedicated fanbase , something that sci - fi in particular has had a very difficult time attaining on network television			1
" @entity101 , creator of @entity102 , attributes it to @entity105 viewing , especially considering its current timeslot			0
" it consistently ranks as one of the highest shows in dvr viewing , " he said			2
" and people who like it really like it			0
" @entity101 quoted a recent interview on thedailybeast.com in which executive producer @entity115 said , " not everybody likes licorice , but people who like licorice really like licorice			2
we 're happy being that			0
" but is being " licorice " really all it takes to make a show successful today ? " ' @entity21 's ' ratings looked very decent for a friday , " said @entity124 , who follows tv viewership very closely as co-founder of @entity128 and found the renewal 's timing " a little odd			1
" " the ratings that matter most are ones nobody sees , the ' @entity137 ' rating that measure commercial viewing live plus three days of @entity105 viewing , " he said			0
" all that dvr viewing is great for @entity14 's pr department , but it does n't add much extra advertising revenue			0
" indeed , the anonymous @entity144 user who claims to work for @entity14 , known as the @entity145 , recently tweeted about an improvement in " @entity21 's " ratings the night after its renewal : " supporting shows by viewing live helps more than u know			1
" another possible factor : science fiction shows typically bring in audiences with higher household incomes			0
" seeing that kind of data was what got me interested in doing the website to begin with , " @entity155 said			0
" however , that data does not flow freely at all			0
" so , despite the advent of dvrs and full episodes streaming online , have there been any other major changes since the days of " @entity2 " that would add more weight to the passion of a show 's fanbase ? " there are now more people watching cable instead of broadcast			0
the broadcast ratings are lower now than they were when ' @entity2 ' was on , " @entity155 said , meaning that some shows do , in fact , stay on the air with ratings that might have gotten them canceled in years past			2
as for whether fan efforts can consistently make the difference between cancellation and renewal -- in the way it seemed for shows like " @entity187 " and " @entity188 " in the past -- @entity155 said , " it ca n't hurt , but i 'm not really sold on that			1
i am sold to some degree : fans ' passion about a show does register with the networks			0
but i do n't think that 's enough to save a show if the ratings are n't any good			0
" no matter the reason , fans understand just how fortunate they are to have the show last this long			0
" as a sci - fi fan , expert and writer , the renewal and network backing pleases me because it sends a message to writers and developers of future science fiction television that there is a place for intricate , intelligent shows with a multilayered plot on network television , that the risks are worth taking , and that networks are beginning to recognize the value of the niche as a fan base , " @entity82 said			1
" i think @entity21 is just a really unique situation			2
it 's been this experimental show at @entity14 since the beginning , " @entity101 said			0
" and so far , it 's gotten through everything thrown at it			0

sci - fi series " @entity21 " was renewed early for a full fourth season on thursday
recent move to friday worried fans and some tv critics alike
fan *devotion* alone usually is n't enough to keep shows on air but does n't hurt
