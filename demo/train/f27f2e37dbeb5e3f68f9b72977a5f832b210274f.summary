-- midway through @entity4 's fitness journey to get six - pack abs by june , the 27 - year - old had a breakdown			1
halfway through his fitness goal , @entity4 said he sees a four - pack gradually forming			1
after months of eschewing junk food in favor of lean protein -- egg whites , chicken breast and vegetables -- he devoured pie			1
the slice came from @entity16 's , drizzled with caramel , loaded with candied apples and layered with cream cheese			2
yes , it was delicious , @entity4 said			1
then he got home and had a @entity22			2
then , he ate a @entity24 ice cream bar			2
the breakdown came late february after months of following a lean diet			2
it also came with consequences			2
" when i woke up the next day , i had a horrible stomach ache , " @entity4 said			1
" my trainer said once you 're on the diet , you can try to go back and have a day where you binge on bad food and it 's going to give you a stomach ache			1
" since january , @entity37 has been following the progress of three @entity40 contributors as they strive to meet their @entity43 's diet and fitness goals			1
one of them is @entity4 , a @entity46 , @entity45 resident , who wanted to get a six - pack by summer in time for his 10 - year high school reunion			1
he also wants to show off a chiseled stomach on his blog called " @entity50 , " where he stands shirtless to give " the naked truth about today 's news			2
" the junk food breakdown came after almost two months of staying on a lean diet			2
the self - described " candyaholic " often craved his favorite treats like @entity57 patties , macaroons , @entity60 bars and @entity61			1
" the key to falling off the wagon is not to stay off the wagon , " said @entity63 , a certified fitness trainer and model whose chiseled six - pack has appeared on the cover of @entity67 18 times			1
" if you fall off the wagon for one day , the problem is it could lead to two days , three days , a week , then you fall off completely			1
next thing you know , it leads to two weeks of binge eating			1
" @entity4 has maintained his diet of 16 egg whites , one and a quarter - pound of meat , four cups of vegetables , potatoes and rice a day			1
he treats himself to one @entity22 a day , and sometimes indulges in gelato			2
@entity4 's quest for six - pack abs -- which initially included 500 daily crunches -- brought attention from his neighbors , an egg company that ships him 15 dozen eggs every two weeks and news media such as @entity98 and his hometown newspaper , @entity100 and blogs			1
some people left words of encouragement for @entity105 's quest for tight abs , but others were less supportive			1
a picture compared him to a toothpick			2
another one showed a kitten shooting a shirtless @entity4			1
" a lot of people said , ' you need to put on a shirt , ' " he said , so @entity4 set up a web site called putonashirt.com where he compiled the comments			1
the hate mail comes " when they see a thin guy trying to be more fit			2
they 're jealous , " @entity4 said			1
the negative comments add fuel to his fire			0
" i 've wanted to do this before and last year , i had the same resolution , " @entity4 said			1
" i did it for two weeks and by january 15 , it was time to move on			0
so i applied for @entity40			0
i wanted people to follow it , so i 'm motivated to do it			0
so many people are watching , so mentally , i have to do it			0
i put my mind to it			0
i have to do it			0
" watch @entity4 's video @entity4 does n't have a six - pack yet			1
" you can see four , " he said			0
" it 's more defined			0
the middle two are coming in			0
i 'm so white it 's hard to see			0
" in january , @entity4 's exercise regimen started with 500 stomach crunches a day , after hearing a @entity146 interview about her sit - ups for toned abs. @entity4 has abandoned the crunches and enlisted a personal trainer who has designed 11 core body exercises			1
for 20 minutes , @entity4 performs 25 repetitions of the exercises , which include a floor bicycle , upward leg lifts and a type of sit - up where he lifts his legs and arms up at the same time			1
he spends an hour jogging , doing cardio and lifting weights			0
he also changes his exercise routines and works out four to five times a week			0
recently , @entity4 lost his job in sales for a @entity46 show , which he attributes to a sluggish economy			1
he still has his job as an emcee for a night club and on the bright side , he said he " can dedicate more time to work out			0
" " i 'm working out my legs and arms to burn the calories , to lose the layer of fat , " he said			0
" i do n't want to plateau and have a two - pack			1
" many fitness fanatics do the same exercises and never see improvements because they plateau , said @entity63 , a trainer in @entity180 , @entity181			2
" in the gym , you need to change the factors of what you 're doing , " he said			0
" if you 're doing heavy weights and lower reps , you can change to more moderate weights and moderate repetitions			0
you can change exercises , do different types of cardio			0
the body adapts to change quickly and responds really well when you hit a plateau			0
" at the same time , some people have difficulty getting a six pack , because of elevated levels of cortisol which can lead to belly fat , said @entity63 , author of " @entity203 : more than 150 meals to feed your muscles and fuel your workouts			2
" " you 've got to make sure the cortisol level is not elevated , " he said			0
" one way is proper sleep and reducing stress			0
" before blaming hormones for flab , @entity63 warned , " you really need to make sure you 're doing all the right things first			0
so many people do n't take accountability			0
" the good news for @entity4 is that the hardest part is getting the initial six pack and afterwards , it gets easier			1
" there 's a big learning curve , " @entity63 said			0
" granted there are people who can eat pizza and can get a six - pack			1
for people struggling to get a six pack , you learn to eat properly , get in a gym and be consistent			2
you know what you need to do			0
definitely , it would be easier to maintain it and more difficult to obtain it in the beginning			0
