@entity4 in a modern twist of public square shaming , a @entity1 court has blazoned the names and offenses of 50 individuals and four companies that have dodged paying fines			1
their photos and personal details have been splashed across a giant electronic screen outside a major train station in @entity15 in @entity1 's southern province , @entity17			1
curious onlookers and commuters gathered outside the bustling train station as a series of individual headshots , identity numbers , their offenses and amounts of outstanding court fines rolled across a massive electronic billboard , one after the other , as shown on @entity1 state television			1
instead of flashing ads , it serves as a public " wall of shame " for those that failed to pay court - ordered fines for violating property disclosure laws , disobeying court orders or failing to respond to subpoenas			1
the amount of outstanding fines range from 10,000 yuan ( $ 1,600 ) up to 29 million yuan ( $ 4.5 million )			1
