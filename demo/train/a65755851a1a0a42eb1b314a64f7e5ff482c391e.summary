-- can lightning strike twice for filmmakers hoping to cash in on the popularity of @entity5 's teen fiction ? the " @entity7 " movies did n't wow critics , but they struck a chord with their target audience			1
i 'm afraid " @entity14 " will only duplicate the first half of that experience			1
the story borrows from @entity17 's " @entity16 , " which has been filmed several times -- by @entity19 in 1956 , @entity20 in 1978 and @entity21 in 1993 , and more recently , but less successfully , by the @entity22 as " the invasion " in 2007			1
the idea that other people are alien automatons just does n't go away			0
@entity5 's 2008 novel " @entity14 " departs from @entity17 's yarn by skipping forward a few years			1
the invasion is over , the body snatchers have won ; only a handful of humans have escaped detection , subsisting off the map , scavenging for survival			0
this is also the first version willing to meet the aliens halfway : they may not be as sexy as vampires in @entity5 's imagination , but they 're about as benevolent as any extraterrestrial occupying power could be			1
in fact , they 're " souls , " a higher form of consciousness who never lie , kill , or steal			0
which makes you wonder how they annexed the @entity50 in the first place ? @entity52 , @entity54 talk ' @entity14 ' @entity56 's heavy - handed adaptation gives rise to that question and several others : like why the souls can not track down the holdouts with their superior otherworldly technology -- or failing that , figure out that anyone wearing sunglasses probably merits cross examination ( after they 've been possessed by the souls , human eyes turn a peculiarly virulent light blue )			1
@entity70 is @entity71 , another of @entity5 's divided " tweenagers , " who falls into the hands of the souls and is possessed by an alien named @entity76 ( " @entity77 " for short )			1
@entity71 is a holdout , though			0
she refuses to vacate her consciousness and carries on an internal debate with @entity77 for most of the story			0
@entity82 is one of our most promising young actresses , but listening to her wrestle for command of her own brain made me yearn for @entity89 's antic duels with @entity90 in " @entity91			1
" @entity89 's bisexual split personality spilled out into the way he held himself , the way he walked , and ate , and urinated			1
@entity82 is more like a ventriloquist 's wooden dummy , understandably unhappy but also unbending no matter who is inside her head			2
@entity71 gains the upper hand long enough to escape the @entity61 ' surveillance and get away to a human sanctuary , a refuge deep inside a cavernous desert butte			0
( this network of caves is the most eye - catching thing in the movie			0
) here she must convince her former friends and family that @entity77 means them no harm -- one of several themes that will echo with " twilight " fans			0
like @entity115 , @entity71 is courted by two rivals : one who was in love with her before her conversion , and another who feels strangely attracted to @entity77			0
" you would n't love me if you saw what i really looked like , " she warns him -- though like horny young men anywhere , he 's not unduly concerned in such philosophical imponderables			2
as for @entity77 , she develops an admiration for the grit and passion embodied by these mortals , and secretly wonders whether a little interstellar intercourse would be such a bad thing ? this is pretty silly stuff , " @entity137 " - lite if you will , but played with maximum solemnity , no discernible humor and minimal excitement			0
at least it 's a modest improvement on @entity56 's last foray into sci - fi allegory , the glum and pretentious " in @entity141 , " and " @entity142 " before that , but by now it 's clear his rudimentary directing skills do n't do his screenplays many favors			2
to be fair , i enjoyed the dazzling hand - cranked solar panels that allow @entity151 's green - fingered old coot @entity150 to farm wheat deep inside a desert crater , not to mention the hare - brained audacity of casting @entity151 as a coot named @entity150			2
and who can resist the unusually crowded romantic triangle -- with four aching hearts but only three bodies to play for ? too bad @entity56 fails to flesh out the male suitors ( @entity52 and @entity54 -- both blandly anonymous ) , and he does n't make much of the story 's most intriguing character -- @entity165 's obsessive alien cop , the seeker -- either			2
that leaves @entity82 talking to herself as the film 's dramatic linchpin , a prospect unlikely to get audiences worked up one way or the other .			1

" @entity14 " is the latest film adaptation of @entity5 novel
@entity5 's " @entity7 " series were super successful
critic says " @entity14 " has a similar formula , but with aliens
