they and their relatives -- crocodiles , caimans and gharials -- can also sing , much like birds do , although most of them sound more like diesel engines or chainsaws being started			1
some crocodilians , the order that includes all of these animals , can even put small sticks on their snouts to lure egrets looking for nest building material			1
in the eight years i 've been studying crocodilians , my research has taken me to 26 countries on five continents			1
i enjoy both the animals and the travel , studying the difficult - to - observe aspects of the life of well - known creatures and exploring the remotest corners of the world in search of more enigmatic species			1
@entity32 hunt with sticks , @entity34 and other researchers say here are a few of the best spots to see rare animals in the wild			1
some are very easy to visit , while others would require a certain adjustment if you have @entity45 standards of safety , personal comfort and hygiene			2
@entity49 , @entity50 have you ever seen an alligator dance ? millions of people visit this national park to see alligators and crocodiles , but some secrets of these animals were n't known until just recently			2
in my first week of research for my phd in 2005 , i discovered " alligator dances , " nighttime courtship gatherings of up to a hundred gators			1
i call them " dances " because they remind me of village dance parties , where people come alone or with their partners to communicate , flirt , shake their booties , show off , pair up and sometimes fight			1
where to go : these dances can be often seen late at night in late april			1
just walk to the end of the park 's @entity75 boardwalk with a flashlight			2

you can also take a whale watching tour to look at gray whales ( in winter and spring ) , blue whales and humpbacks ( in summer and fall ) , and with some luck , killer whales , dolphins , porpoises and whatever else comes by			2

@entity123 , @entity124 this is a stunning part of the continent , where i 've dived with giant @entity129 sharks , petted a seal pup , paddled around a colossal meteor crater and watched a huge gannet colony at arm 's length			1
july and august are good for diving and birding , november is good for aurora spotting , and seal pups appear in march			2
where to go : the best places to visit are @entity141 , with the largest gannet colony in @entity143 and good summer seal - and whale - watching ; @entity146 , where you can take a helicopter tour to see harp and hooded seal pups in march ; @entity151 for diving , and the road to @entity154 for @entity156 scenery , wildlife and the @entity158			1
@entity159 , @entity160 this is my favorite corner of the @entity163 , where i studied caimans in 2007 , and it 's beautifully preserved			2
it has miles upon miles of @entity169 regia water lily - covered lakes , pristine forests , tranquil rivers and lush savannahs			2
where to go : @entity174 is a private reserve with almost no hunting , so monkeys , birds , giant otters , anteaters and other wildlife are tame and easy to watch			0
10 ultimate adventures around the @entity183 @entity184 , @entity185 @entity184 is my favorite place in @entity188 to see wildlife			1
it 's especially good if you have kids because it 's easily accessible ; the camps are very comfortable and safe ; there 's a big store with all kinds of supplies and the animals are always present in huge numbers			0
where to go : in august and september you can sit on a bench facing a watering hole , and watch countless herds of antelopes , zebras , elephants , giraffes and other animals walk in from the desert			0
it 's a better wildlife spectacle than the more popular @entity214 migration			0
@entity215 , @entity216 @entity216 has so much biodiversity that biologists think of it as a small continent rather than a big island			0
@entity215 has the largest remaining lowland rainforest there , still relatively pristine and containing a lot of yet undescribed plants and animals , as well as the most beautiful lemurs , the weirdest geckos and chameleons the size of a match			1
where to go : visit @entity215 , where you can arrange a variety of hikes , walking tours or overnight camping trips			0

i explored the @entity271 side in 1993 during a four - month hitchhiking trip around @entity271 and visited the @entity270 part in 2004 to look for the woolly flying squirrel , the largest and rarest squirrel in the world			1
i eventually found it one magical winter night in the snow - covered forests of @entity288 , the westernmost @entity290 peak			0
where to go ( if you dare ) : this is n't always a safe trip			0
from the @entity270 part of the road , i like to travel to @entity297 ; to ancient castles of @entity299 ; or up one of the numerous glaciers that terminate near the highway			1
in @entity271 , the area between @entity304 and @entity305 has several lakes with splendid views of both peaks , and a camp where you can stay in a @entity312 yurt			0
the border crossing area is a nature reserve with lots of ibex , giant @entity319 sheep and snow leopards			0
the @entity271 side of the nature reserve is @entity321			0
the @entity270 side is @entity323			1
@entity324 , @entity325 perhaps the world 's hottest desert , @entity326 is also difficult and dangerous for travelers			1

i 've been at the edges of this fascinating realm , and hope to explore it thoroughly someday			0
where to go ( if you dare ) : @entity374 has a boiling lava lake and both lowland and mountain gorillas			0
