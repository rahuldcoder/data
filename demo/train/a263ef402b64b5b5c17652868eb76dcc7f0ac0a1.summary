when @entity1 was convicted again on thursday , @entity0 reacted with bafflement			1
the appeal was the third round through @entity6 's grinding , multi-level legal system , with its numerous checks and balances			2
but the saga is also confusing because , while the crime is simple , the case built around it is a grand spectacle combining aspects of national pride , sexist archetypes and race			2
@entity17 and her co-defendant , @entity18 , were first convicted by a jury in 2009 for the murder of @entity24 student @entity22 in 2007			1
an appellate judge overturned the conviction in 2011 and @entity17 returned to the @entity0 after four years in jail			1
the prosecutor then appealed the acquittal to the @entity6 @entity30 , which sent the case to the new appellate panel that reinstated the conviction			1
it is n't over yet			0
the defendants will now appeal and the case eventually could be returned to another appellate panel for yet another review			0
i spent two years researching and writing a book about the @entity17 case , living in @entity42 , attending the trial , interviewing every lawyer involved in the case , reviewing thousands of pages of police documents and court transcripts , interviewing forensic police , coroners , the principals of the case , their family members and associates			1
americans like me who believe the case against @entity17 and her then - boyfriend is fatally flawed have been accused of disliking @entity6 or disrespecting its judicial system			1
but what has happened in the @entity1 case is not an @entity6 problem			1
when prosecutors make mistakes anywhere in the world , they do n't like to admit it			2
it takes an exceptionally brave and wise " @entity70 " to reframe a case after arresting the wrong people			2
the latest @entity6 proceeding did not involve any new evidence and , sadly , did n't shed any new light on the crime			1
there is still no proof that @entity1 was in the bedroom where someone stabbed @entity22			1
the dna and fingerprint evidence is still entirely linked to a man named @entity22 , who is serving a 16 - year jail sentence for the murder -- shortened thanks to testimony that put @entity1 on the crime scene			1
after he arrested them , the trial prosecutor proposed that the motive was a post-halloween ritualistic sex game			0
but when authorities soon realized the dna and fingerprints in the murder room belonged to neither @entity17 nor @entity18 , rather than reframing their case , the small town prosecutors and police in the glare of international media dug in their heels			1
in the latest proceeding , a new prosecutor abandoned the sex game motive but suggested @entity17 murdered @entity105 after an altercation over @entity17 's poor hygiene and sloppy housekeeping			1
in other words , out with @entity109 and in with the dirty laundry			0
with no hard evidence and no credible motive , spectators around the world are right to wonder what 's going on in these @entity6 courtrooms			1
@entity22 has never denied watching @entity22 bleed to death , and he left a bloody handprint in the victim 's blood on her wall			2
according to testimony from @entity6 forensic police , his dna was inside the victim — although it was not clear whether there was a sexual assault			2
in his prison writings and in his testimony at his appeal , he talked of how difficult it was for him to get the image of the blood that flowed from @entity22 out of his head			2
did this garish confession shock the @entity42 authorities and courthouse press corps into trying to ascertain just who and what this young man was ? on the contrary , he apparently elicited mercy , and had his sentence cut in half			0
he may well be walking free before the @entity17 case is settled			1
in his first comments on the case , before he was captured , @entity149 was surreptitiously recorded by @entity42 police in a @entity154 conversation with a friend , according to police wiretap transcripts in the trial record , saying that @entity17 had nothing to do with it			1
but as soon as he was connected with a defense lawyer , he started to change his story			0
it 's a trope of the case that @entity17 ( and @entity18 ) had a p.r. machine , vast amounts of money and great legal defense , while @entity149 was legally under - served			1
in fact , his attorney was one of the busiest criminal defense lawyers in @entity42 , well - connected with the prosecution , with a career behind him handling hundreds if not thousands of local crimes , often involving drugs and violence			0
prosecutors ' reluctance to deeply investigate @entity149 is understandable ; they do n't want to know			0
but @entity149 may be the most interesting character in the story			0
born in @entity179 , brought to @entity6 at age 5 , he is more @entity6 than most immigrants , but , like other immigrants , he is legally just a guest in the homogenous country , not a citizen , required to report to the authorities annually ( which was why his fingerprints were on file in @entity42 )			2
in the months before the @entity105 murder , @entity149 was broke and showing signs of mental illness , and was involved in three and possibly more home invasions , according to police reports , trial testimony and interviews with victims			0
his apparent modus operandi was to break into what he thought were empty houses and make himself at home			0
a few weeks before the @entity105 murder , someone broke into a @entity42 law office through a second floor window , according to trial testimony from the lawyer who practiced there , turned up the heat , rearranged small trinkets , drank an orange soda from the refrigerator and appeared to have slept on the couch before making off with a laptop			0
at a nursery school in @entity214 a week later , director @entity212 , walked in on a saturday and found @entity149 sitting at her desk , she told me in an interview			0
they found the stolen laptop and a knife in his pack			0
@entity224 suspected he might have gotten a key to the nursery school from one of her employees who frequented the @entity214 club scene			0
@entity224 told me she believed he spent a night on the children 's cots and cooked a pot of pasta in the kitchen , then placed it in little bowls around the room			0
from that interview and many more , i pieced together a picture of a young man who seemed to be acting out some sort of fantasy of a home , a fantasy that perhaps abruptly cracked when @entity22 came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house , and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him			2
( @entity149 has maintained " whoever committed this terrible crime is still free			0
" ) i believe one reason for the lack of interest in this young man is that a man killing a woman is mundane and boring , compared with the more titillating image of women fighting and killing each other			1
the other reason , sadly , is a kind of reverse racism			0
he 's black , and innocent black men are far too often railroaded in white systems , @entity6 and @entity0			1
to suggest that this young man might have been the lone killer has a taint of political incorrectness			0
male violence against women is a major public health problem worldwide , according to the @entity275			0
in the end , in this case , it appears that the commonness of the crime is what the @entity6 prosecutors — and many others -- refuse to accept , searching for something more interesting and unique , in an elaborate , headline - grabbing crackpot theory that , they unfortunately still can not relinquish			1
remove the racial aspect , forget national pride and whether you " like " @entity1 , and we can see that this simple tragedy is all too routine .			2

@entity292 : *guilty* *verdict* -- again -- for @entity1 baffles @entity0 for good reason
she says @entity6 prosecutors still lack evidence , but *unwilling* to admit mistake , reframe case
she says far more ties just @entity22 to murder . prosecutors choose to *pursue* @entity17
@entity304 : men *hurting* women almost banal ; @entity6 prosecutors prefer tale of white women , sex
