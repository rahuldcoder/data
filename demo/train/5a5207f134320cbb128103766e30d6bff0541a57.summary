@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a brightly - lit @entity0 restaurant , 21 - year - old @entity3 , a migrant worker from the inland province of @entity5 , describes his life in this southern @entity1 city as " bu kai xin " -- glum			1
he says his working hours are too long ; his salary too low and he has no personal life			0
" i feel lonely in this big city , " he says			0
for the past three years , @entity3 has been fixing photocopy machines at various factories in @entity1 's manufacturing heartland			1
his monthly salary of 3,500 to 4,500 yuan ( $ 580 - $ 740 ) -- depending on overtime -- is higher than the average wage , but only because his job requires more risks -- the ink has toxic fumes			2
yet , he worries about losing a job he loathes			0
in fact , he says he feels constantly anxious -- a state of mind made clear by a habit of cracking his knuckles and jiggling his leg as he talks			0
if he were able to speak to a psychologist , it 's possible he would be diagnosed as suffering from anxiety disorder , a common problem among migrant workers , according to professor @entity34 at @entity35 in @entity36			1
" their mental health is far more worrying than we originally thought , " he said			1
emotional burden @entity34 and his colleagues interviewed 807 migrant workers in the @entity0 area and had in - depth conversations with 60 of them			1
their research suggested that 58.5 % of those surveyed suffered from depression , 17 % from anxiety and 4.6 % had considered the idea of suicide			0
his team found that the majority of those surveyed , half of whom were under 30 , bore a heavy financial and emotional burden as they left behind aging parents or young children			1
they felt guilty for being unable to care for them and , at the same time , felt pressure to provide for their families			0
@entity34 said he first noticed this issue five years ago when he conducted research on the mental health of sex workers in the region , most of whom worked at factories before turning to prostitution			1
in 2010 , the issue made international headlines after a spate of worker suicides at @entity78 , a large electronic manufacturer that assembles many @entity81 products , making the professor determined to find out the root causes of the workers ' mental health problems			1
loneliness and a sense of isolation were reported to be among the reasons that drove the workers to jump off factory and dormitory roofs			2
though the focus of @entity34 's research was in the southern province of @entity98 , the mental health of migrants is likely to be similar elsewhere in the country			1
some 260 million @entity1 farmers have left their villages and to work in cities , according to the @entity103			1
despite their contribution to @entity1 's economic miracle , the social status of these migrant workers remains low			1
it 's not a phenomenon unique to @entity1			1
throughout the world , research suggests that migrant workers are more likely to experience mental illness than those who stay behind as they adjust to a new environment without their families and social support groups			1
in @entity1 's case , the hukou system -- or household registration system that divides the population into two distinct categories of the urban and the rural -- makes things harder for the migrants , who do n't enjoy the same access to healthcare and education as other city residents			1
they are often discriminated against in terms of salary and treatment			0
better - educated and internet savvy , younger migrants like @entity3 suffer more from this urban - rural divide than their elders			1
@entity3 's parents left home with one goal in mind : making money in the city and then returning home			2
' toad who eats swan meat ? ' @entity3 , however , aspires to become a true urbanite and wants to be an interior designer			0
he tries to study the subject on his own but struggles to find time to do so			0
his parents -- who work in @entity0 as a small time trader and a domestic helper - laugh at his efforts , calling him " a toad who dreams of eating swan meat			2
" " the glaring gap between what they desire and the harsh reality intensifies the anxiety and depression for some young workers , " said @entity34			2
many workers ' lives are confined to production lines and dormitories			2
they may change jobs -- indeed they change more frequently than their parents did -- but their chances of climbing up to the next level to become , say , a designer , are limited			2
having grown up with his grandparents in his hometown in @entity5 , @entity3 does n't have much to say to his parents			2
he is aware that he should consider himself lucky to have his family around , but he nevertheless feels lonely in @entity0			0
he has only a few friends here , all young migrants from @entity5			2
constrained by time , money and changing shifts , they are unable to meet often			0
one day , he hopes to settle in @entity184 , the capital of his province where he spent two happy years studying at a technology college			0
the government recently announced plans to relax the control over hukou system in a bid to narrow the gap between rural and urban areas and to help migrants assimilate better into the city life			0
but the process will be a long and slow one			0
" we just have to pay more attention to mental diseases as they can lead to suicide , " said @entity34			0
he recommends compulsory mental health testing in the workplace and a practice he calls " positive psychological intervention " -- setting up hotlines and counseling services and providing workers with more opportunities to socialize			1
it is a big question when , if at all , professor @entity34 's ideas may be turned into reality			0
for young @entity3 and millions like him , the struggle is likely to continue .			0

@entity1 has more than 260 million migrant workers
survey suggests many may suffer from mental health problems
leaving behind children and elderly parents an emotional and financial burden
better - educated and internet savvy , younger migrants suffer more than their elders
