in @entity0 , a " prayer for peace " and a candlelight vigil will take place sunday evening			0
another candlelight vigil will take place at the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			0
" the public has had enough of the police and prosecutors operating in secrecy when it comes to people of color , especially african - americans , " said @entity65 , president of the @entity1 @entity66 , the group planning the @entity0 vigil			0
the case has sparked a national debate over the @entity1 law and concerns about racial profiling			2
@entity13 was black and @entity24 is white @entity82			1
the attorney for @entity13 's family , meanwhile , said bringing a federal hate crime charge against @entity24 will be " a challenge , to put it lightly			1
" family of @entity13 to pursue civil case @entity89 told board members of the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) on saturday that prosecution on the state level stands a better chance			1
" most state laws tend to be better for the prosecution of state crimes			0
and that 's why we see the federal authorities expressing , although gently , in their statements that they can only do so much if there 's some type of race statements involved			2
the state officials do n't have that problem , " @entity89 said			0
" i think the focus is not necessarily a federal arrest over a state arrest			0
we want an arrest , period			0
and i think that the state aspect of that is the one that 's most feasible , most attainable in this matter			2
" @entity89 said there is evidence that the @entity119 homeowners ' association told residents who saw suspicious activity to call @entity24 if they could not contact the police , according to an @entity91 statement			0
the @entity13 family plans to pursue a civil case against the homeowners ' association , @entity89 said			1

" we as a nation have become much too violent , " the rev. @entity130 said sunday			1
" ... if it 's black on white , it 's jail time			2
if it 's white on black , it 's revolt time			2
if it 's black on black , or white on white , or brown on brown , it 's @entity144 time			2
" in response to an @entity147 report that @entity24 worked at the @entity148 , @entity1 , office of @entity150 , a spokeswoman for the the risk mitigation and surveillance company said sunday she could not comment on @entity24 's current or future employment status , but " we can confirm he is not at the building , nor has he been since the incident			2
" " our utmost concern is for the safety of our employees , specifically based on the potential turmoil that could arise from the recent announcement of a bounty for his capture , " spokeswoman @entity160 said in a statement			0
@entity24 's attorney said sunday that after reviewing @entity1 's " stand your ground " law , he believes it applies to the situation and that his client is innocent			1
initially , lawyer @entity177 said last week the law was " not really applicable to this case			2
the statute on ' stand your ground ' is primarily when you 're in your house			1
" " this is self - defense , and that 's been around for forever -- that you have a right to defend yourself , " @entity177 said earlier			2
" so the next issue ( that ) is going to come up is , was he justified in using the amount of force he did ? " the 2005 law allows people to use deadly force anywhere they have a right to be if they have reasonable fear an assailant could seriously harm them or someone else			2
it also eliminated a long - standing " duty to retreat " in the face of imminent harm , asserting that would - be crime victims have the right to " stand their ground " and " meet force with force " when attacked			1
noting that 23 states have some version of the " stand your ground " law on their books , sen. @entity210 , @entity211 , called sunday for the @entity219 to investigate " whether these laws are creating more violence than they are preventing " and whether some deaths go unprosecuted " because the laws place unintended additional burdens on local police and prosecutors that encourage dismissals of otherwise problematic cases			1
" " these laws seem to be encouraging vigilantism by allowing individuals to use deadly force as a first resort , " @entity210 wrote in a sunday letter to attorney general @entity230			0
the @entity236 said officers were prohibited from arresting @entity24 the night of the shooting because physical evidence and testimony supported his claim that he acted in self - defense in accordance with @entity1 law			0
the police department gave the explanation to city manager @entity247 , who included it in a letter to the community about the case , posted on the city 's website			1
@entity24 said he was driving in his gated community when he saw @entity13 walking and called 911 to report a suspicious person			1
@entity24 told the dispatcher he was following the boy , but the dispatcher told him that was n't necessary			0
moments later , several neighbors called 911 to report a commotion outside , and police arrived to find @entity13 dead of a gunshot wound			1
@entity177 says his client was injured that night and went to the hospital with a broken nose and a serious cut on the back of his head			0
@entity0 police said @entity24 did not indicate a chase , telling them instead that " he had lost sight of @entity13 and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by @entity280 , " the police said in the letter posted by @entity247			1
@entity1 gov. @entity282 has formed a task force to review the law in the wake of the shooting			0
@entity282 told @entity2 's " @entity294 " on sunday that he met with @entity13 's parents thursday to " let them know that i appointed a new state attorney and introduced them to the @entity292 agents that are working on the case			1
" " your heart goes out to them because ... no family ever imagines this could happen to their child , " the governor said			0
@entity2 's @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 contributed to this report .			0
