this time , too , @entity1 is pinning hopes on veteran athlete @entity17 , who will be competing at the @entity27 in the women 's 100 - meter and 200 - meter events			1
although she stands at no. 31 in the @entity33 rankings list for the 100 - meter sprint , it does not exhibit her true potential			0
