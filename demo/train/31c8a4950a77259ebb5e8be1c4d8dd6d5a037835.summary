-- @entity1 is notably normal compared with the kooky roles she 's known for playing			1
whether it 's her 10 - season stint as @entity5 or the fame - starved @entity6 on just one season of " @entity6 , " the actress admits a fondness for delusional characters			1
since " friends " ended in 2004 , @entity11 has developed and appeared in several other shows , and become a producer and writer of her own projects , including " web therapy , " in which she plays self - obsessed internet therapist @entity18			1
the @entity20 series enters its third season on tuesday , july 23			2
the new episodes take place solely in online video @entity25 chats , and will feature a slew of new guest stars , including @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , as @entity18 grapples with the ramifications of last season 's finale			2
@entity1 also executive produces the documentary series " @entity39 " which premieres the same day on @entity38			1
that show , which traces the ancestry of various celebrities , is an opportunity for @entity1 to dive into her work off - camera as well			1
the fourth season of the show will feature eight episodes and look into the backgrounds of @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
@entity1 invited @entity0 to the offices of her production company , is or is n't @entity61 , which she owns with @entity62 and @entity63 , to discuss both projects			1
sitting in the space 's living - room - like conference room , where a massive bulletin board displayed the episode breakdown of this season of " web therapy , " @entity1 discussed her work on the shows and why fans need to stop waiting for a " friends " movie			1
@entity0 : did you get these two shows to premiere on the same day on purpose ? @entity1 : is n't that crazy ? we do n't have that kind of power over @entity38 and @entity20			1
i think @entity20 changed the date , but i do n't think that 's why			1
@entity0 : is there one person on " @entity39 " this season whose story was most compelling to you ? @entity1 : they 're all really compelling			1
that 's why we end up shooting them			2
one of the more different ones we 've ever done is @entity58			2
her father is @entity95 and her mother is @entity97 and they were all raised to be @entity95			2
her mother 's parents were here from @entity97 and she grew up with them and knew them really well			2
her grandfather was a soldier during @entity103 who never spoke about it and so she 's always wondered			2
she knew it would be hard			2
@entity0 : for those who are n't familiar with " web therapy , " can you set up the premise ? @entity1 : it 's a really bad therapist named @entity18 who conducts sessions online only through @entity25			1
three - minute sessions , because that 's all she really wants to do			2
we end up seeing a lot of her life happen			2
@entity0 : when the show began as a web series , how much of the show 's narrative did you have planned out ? @entity1 : we certainly knew she had not a great marriage , but it worked given who the two people were			1
at first we were n't going to see ( her husband ) @entity128 until the end -- that was the big surprise -- but then once it was a half - hour format we thought " ok we need to know a little more about her			1
" we had her mother show up because we thought it would be important to know why she 's so damaged			0
@entity0 : when you shoot the online sessions , are you actually interacting with the other actors or do those scenes happen separately ? @entity1 : we are shooting together			1
we 're on different sets but on the lens of the camera that we 're looking into there 's a prompter that 's a monitor			0
so i can see everything the other person is doing in real time and we can hear each other in real time			0
so it 's like a real @entity25 session			0
@entity0 : how much is actually improvised ? @entity1 : the dialogue is improvised for sure			1
we come up with the outlines for stories and we give those to people			0
sometimes when we 're coming up with the story we have some lines that we think are funny and the person can use them or not			0
mostly , it 's improvised			0
we 're listening and talking to each other			0
and sometimes i crack myself up , which is embarrassing in a whole other way			0
@entity0 : what 's changing for @entity18 in this new season ? @entity1 : she 's not changing as a person , but she 's taking some hard knocks			1
in the season before with the campaign -- her husband @entity128 was running for @entity174 -- it all exploded because he was having an affair with his campaign manager , @entity176			0
so they have in fact run off together			0
they 're living the gay life , but we 'll see them			0
so he wants to divorce her and she 's also being investigated for campaign finance improprieties			0
( her assistant ) @entity188 has left her to work for her mother , who has stolen the idea of web therapy			0
she 's doing @entity192 , which is different			0
@entity0 : how many of your " friends " co-stars have now appeared on " @entity191 " ? @entity1 : we had @entity198 ( @entity199 ) in the first season , ( @entity202 ) @entity201 in the second season and now we have @entity32			1
@entity0 : watching this show and going back to " @entity6 " and " friends , " it seems like you 're attracted to characters who are pretty delusional			1
does that feel true ? @entity1 : yes , that 's what 's funny to me ! delusional people are really funny to me			1
people who live in a different reality , and it 's really obvious to everybody else but them , is really funny			0
for @entity18 and @entity6 , there 's a certain amount of @entity222 coating them			0
things do n't stick too much			1
mess does n't stick too much			1
if you have kids and you 're at a school , the parents are all " oh no , my 2 - year - old can read ! " i think people are always spinning things and that 's what i 'm interested in			0
i had to learn to spin things when my son started school			0
maybe it 's just people in a panic trying to look calm is what makes me laugh			0
@entity0 : how did you feel about the false news a few months ago that a " friends " movie was in the works ? @entity1 : well , i knew there was n't ever a movie			1
there was never a " friends " movie			1
so i 've always known it 's not happening			0
but with this last rumor someone came up with a great graphic with the couch and it looked like a real teaser and i went , " wait ! " and then someone came up with a fake story and got some publication to buy the lie that there was going to be a reunion , so i saw on @entity267 people were posting this article that @entity269 was really going to do it			0
and i went , " wait a minute , was i not invited ? oh my @entity271 , maybe there is one and i was n't asked to do it			1
" i even had a moment where i believed it because everything around it looked real			0
it was a good setup			0
@entity0 : are the rumors finally put to rest ? @entity1 : the creators have put them to rest			1
i do n't know who else needs to say , " it 's really not happening			2
" @entity0 : @entity285 recently listed " @entity6 " as one of the 100 @entity287			0
do you think you 'd ever revisit that show ? @entity1 : we talk about it all the time , we just have n't asked @entity292			1
maybe a special , maybe not the series again			0
at the time we did n't see where it would end			2
( the character ) really just wants celebrity and i think now that we 're all a little more comfortable with that notion , it could be interesting .			0
