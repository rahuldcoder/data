@entity0 -- former @entity0 mayor @entity2 paid tribute to his " friend and comrade " @entity6 , calling him the first @entity8 president to " put his people before the interests of @entity13 oil companies			1
" @entity6 , who died tuesday , used some of @entity8 's vast oil wealth to bankroll huge social programs for the poor during his 14 - year presidency			1
critics , on the other hand , say much of the country 's oil riches were squandered by a corrupt administration more focused on consolidating political power than lifting people out of poverty			0
@entity2 , nicknamed " @entity2 " for his socialist leanings , struck a controversial deal in 2007 with @entity6 to fuel @entity0 's buses with discounted @entity8 fuel , in exchange for advice on how to develop @entity8 's urban infrastructure			1
while @entity2 used the £ 14 million ( $ 21m ) fuel discount to subsidize buses for the poor in @entity0 , his critics say the deal exploited and further impoverished the poor people of @entity8			1
his successor , @entity40 , promptly cancelled the deal upon taking office in 2008			0
@entity2 dismissed criticism of the deal , saying the advice he and his associates gave @entity8 would have cost " hundreds of millions of pounds " from the private sector , and insisting @entity6 only ever had the interests of @entity8 in mind			1
" it 's very few world leaders who remain unchanged , " @entity2 told @entity1			0
" and it 's hard to think of anyone who has been in power that long who 's carried on looking after the ordinary population rather than enriching themselves			0
" the former mayor first met @entity6 during the @entity8 leader 's 2006 visit to @entity0 and said @entity6 's offer of discounted oil for advice was characteristic of a man who saw himself as more than just the president of @entity8			1
he said : " @entity6 saw clearly that his job was to look out for the people of @entity8 , but he also saw that it was a global struggle between the great corporations and the vast mass of the people who get screwed by them			1
" @entity2 , who would end up travelling to @entity73 in 2008 to deliver the advice he promised as part of the oil deal , was taken aback by the " proper welfare state " @entity6 had created through his initiatives			2
" i found it amazing the number of 40 - year - olds wandering around with braces on their teeth , because there had n't been a dentist when they were a kid , " he said			0
" there were little old ladies carrying around copies of the constitution which they could read , because [ under @entity6 ] everyone got access to literacy programs			0
" calling him a " pleasure to be with , " @entity2 said @entity6 told him he never planned on being a politician - and that @entity6 only became more radical following the failed 2002 coup attempt , which he blamed on the @entity99 the coup fell apart within 48 hours and " @entity101 , " as he is affectionately known in @entity8 , was restored to office			1
@entity2 , who called @entity6 a man with great tales , says the @entity13 leader 's " best story " was his version of events during the coup			2
@entity2 said @entity6 told him that the generals who sprung the coup did n't want to kill the president themselves , so @entity6 claimed three @entity99 whom he did not identify were flown in to kill him instead			2
" @entity6 told me that the three @entity99 were ushered into the room where a sergeant with a machine gun was guarding him			0
and the sergeant , who was n't stupid , realized that after they killed @entity6 they 'd kill him as a witness			0
and so he turned his gun on the three men and said ' you leave the room or i 'll kill you ' , " @entity2 told @entity1			0
a @entity124 official categorically denied @entity6 's " ridiculous " claim and told @entity1 the @entity99 had in fact alerted @entity6 to a " credible assassination plot " on his life in the days before the coup			2
souring @entity99 - @entity8 relations reached their nadir when @entity6 called @entity132 " the devil " in a speech in front of the @entity136			2
watch : @entity6 calls @entity132 " the devil " at @entity138 " coming so close to death [ in 2002 ] really pushed @entity6 to the left , " @entity2 said			1
" if you think @entity132 has authorized your assassination , you 're not going to be very friendly about the @entity99 after that			0

@entity2 calls @entity6 's death a " *sad* loss , " calls him a " friend and comrade "
