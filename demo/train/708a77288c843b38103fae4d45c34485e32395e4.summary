@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 reported tuesday finding radioactive materials at levels " drastically exceeding legal limits " in 11 types of vegetable grown in @entity9 , including broccoli and cabbage , according to @entity12			1
none of the vegetables has been shipped since monday , it said			1
the news agency , citing the ministry , said , " if a person eats 100 grams ( 3 1/2 ounces ) of the vegetable with the largest detected amount of radioactive materials for about 10 days , it would be equal to ingesting half the amount of radiation a person typically receives from the natural environment in a year			2
" if a person keeps eating the vegetable at the same pace , the amount of radiation intake could exceed the amount deemed safe			1
" prime minister @entity33 asked @entity34 -- near the stricken @entity36 nuclear power plant -- to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley , chief cabinet secretary @entity32 told reporters wednesday			2
and the government of @entity9 told residents not to eat leafy vegetables , he added			1
" even if you do eat these food items now , it 's not going to cause any human health problems right away , and these levels are not high , so it would not cause any health problems over the longer term , " he said			1
but , as the radiation levels continue to rise , " we are looking at the possibility of levels reaching levels that may harm human health , " he said			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity59 on tuesday said it has issued an import alert covering milk , milk products , fresh vegetables and fruit from any of four prefectures near the @entity3 reactors -- @entity9 , @entity34 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
under the alert , those products will be prevented from entering the @entity72			1
other food products from one of those prefectures will be diverted for testing , she said			1
but the @entity78 said its air monitors -- three in @entity80 and one in @entity82 -- have detected levels of radiation that were " millions of times below levels of concern			1
" meanwhile , the process of getting @entity72 out of the stricken region continued tuesday			1
seven charter flights left @entity3 tuesday carrying about 1,800 military dependents voluntarily evacuating from @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
some of the flights were bound for @entity96 and the rest to @entity98 in @entity80			2
as the @entity100 continues to distribute potassium iodide to personnel , the service is instructing sailors who have come within 100 miles of the damaged reactor to take the pills , said @entity106			2
that recommendation clashes with one issued monday by the @entity109 , which said it was making available supplies of the pills to @entity72 government - related personnel in @entity3 , but that the distribution was being carried out only as a precaution			1
" no one should take @entity120 at this time , " it said , referring to the salt by its chemical formula			2
the @entity109 did not immediately return a call seeking an explanation for the divergent recommendations			2
the salt protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine but can result in side effects , especially among people with allergies to iodine and shellfish and those who have kidney disease , certain skin disorders and thyroid problems , according to the @entity136 of @entity137			1
the @entity138 reported tuesday that the disaster has killed at least 9,301 people and left at least 13,786 missing , many of them killed when a wall of water swept over them after the quake			2
workers at the @entity36 nuclear power plant have been checked for radiation levels			1
@entity150 aired what it said were the first interviews with workers , which were conducted tuesday from @entity155 in @entity9 , where they have been billeted			2
" it has settled down quite a lot compared to the beginning and we could even begin to see a bright hope that maybe it would somehow work out in a little bit , " said one man			1
" we are constantly switching over all the time , since the work can not be stopped , " said another			0
neither man was identified by name			0
as for the plant 's six reactors , @entity169 official @entity168 said wednesday that power had been connected to reactor no. 1 and fire trucks were being used to inject seawater into the core to cool it			0
the @entity175 reported tuesday that coolant in the unit was covering only about half of the fuel rods in reactor @entity180 , 1 , 2 and 3 and that @entity3 officials believe their cores have been damaged			0
in the no. 2 reactor , power had not been restored , but the core was stable and workers were continuing to inject seawater into the spent - fuel storage pool , he said			0
the @entity175 said that , after an explosion march 15 , officials expressed concern that the containment vessel may no longer be intact			1
in the no. 3 reactor , electricity has been restored to the central control room and the @entity197 was expected to start spraying water into the spent - fuel storage pool beginning at 4 p.m. wednesday , @entity168 said			0
the no. 3 reactor has been a priority for authorities trying to contain damage to the plant and stave off a possible meltdown			0
its fuel includes plutonium mixed with the uranium in its fuel rods , which experts say could cause more harm than regular uranium fuels in the event of a meltdown			0
in the no. 4 reactor , power was connected to the control board ; because the reactor has no fuel rods , the focus was on continuing spraying rods in the spent - fuel pool , he said			0
power has also been connected to the no. 5 and no. 6 reactors , he said			0
officials say some radiation has been released from the crippled plant since the quake and tsunami			0
and with the nuclear plant 's six reactors in various states of disrepair , concerns have mounted over a potentially larger release of radioactive material from the facility , located about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0			0
restoration of power may not solve the cooling problems			1
@entity243 said monday the quake and tsunami had damaged pumps and other gear at units no. 1 through no. 4			0
the company said spare parts were being brought in to make the repairs			0
the coolant pools contain used fuel rods that are radioactive and generate heat			0
authorities have been working to keep the pools full to prevent the rods from being exposed and releasing radiation			0
about 660 workers were at the site tuesday , @entity243 said			0
about 330 of those were employees of the power company			0
several countries , including the @entity72 , have urged citizens living within 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) of the plant to evacuate or stay indoors			1
@entity1 's @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0

new : eating *contaminated* food " is not going to cause any health problems " long term
@entity78 finds levels in the @entity72 " millions of times below levels of concern "
" it has settled down a lot , " says a worker
