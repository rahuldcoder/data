courtroom experts call it a one - of - kind murder mystery that some people believe has yet to be completely solved			2
the remarkable story of @entity5 and the stabbing deaths of a mother and two small girls is full of shocking legal twists and turns			1
during the course of 21 years , @entity5 underwent three trials for the same crimes in three courtrooms			1
the case puts constitutional questions about double jeopardy squarely under the spotlight			1
it all began in @entity20 , @entity21 , in 1985			2
@entity5 , who was then a 27 - year - old @entity22 soldier based at nearby @entity23 , visited the home of @entity25 and her husband , @entity26 , a captain in the @entity28			1
the @entity29 were planning to move outside the country and had placed an ad in the newspaper to sell their dog			2
@entity5 stopped by the house in response to the ad			1
four days later , when neighbors became concerned , police entered the home to find the bloody bodies of @entity41 and two of her daughters			2
the youngest @entity45 child , a 22 - month - old girl named @entity46 , was found in the house alive			2
police said @entity49 was undergoing training in @entity51 at the time of the killings			2
@entity5 came forward to police when he heard on tv news that authorities were looking for a man who visited the house in response to a newspaper ad			1
investigators had been gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses			2
a witness named @entity64 said he was near the @entity45 home the night of the killings and saw a tall white man wearing jeans , a knit cap and a members only jacket leaving the @entity29 ' driveway with a trash bag			0
a police artist drew a sketch based on @entity64 's description			0
prosecutors said the sketch resembled @entity5			1
police put @entity5 in a line up , and prosecutors said @entity64 identified @entity5 as the man he saw			1
in 1986 , his first trial police arrested @entity5 and in 1986 , prosecutors put him on trial			1
they said his motive was sex			0
the theory was that " @entity5 ' wife was out of town , he had a new baby and so he decided to make a pass at a married mother of three -- and that did n't go well , " former local reporter @entity95 told @entity97 's " @entity96			1
" @entity95 had covered the case in depth for @entity102 's @entity101 newspaper			2
@entity49 told police several items were missing from his home , including an envelope of cash , an atm card and the @entity110 account password			0
police said the atm card was used to withdraw $ 150 twice over two days			0
prosecutors said @entity5 was behind on his rent , which was about $ 300			1
he paid his rent the monday after the killings , prosecutors said			0
a woman who used the same bank @entity118 shortly after the @entity29 ' atm card was used told investigators she saw a man nearby matching @entity5 ' description			1
during the trial , prosecutors showed jurors gruesome police photos to illustrate their case			2
the jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced @entity5 to death			1
while on death row , @entity5 received a mysterious , anonymous letter in the mail : " dear mr. @entity5 , " the letter said			1
" i did the crime , i murdered the @entity29			0
sorry you 're doin the time			0
i 'll be safely out of @entity21 when you read this			0
thanks , mr. x " the letter 's author was never determined			2
a second chance to prove his case @entity5 ' lawyers appealed his case to @entity21 's @entity146 , where judges ruled that the graphic police photos had wrongly influenced jurors to render a guilty verdict			1
the ruling allowed @entity5 a rare second chance to prove his case in a retrial			1
compared with the first trial , @entity5 ' defense attorneys engineered a complete 180 on their strategy			1
after exhaustive preparation , they attacked many of the prosecutors ' most damaging accusations one by one			0
they discredited the prosecutors ' star witness , @entity64 , and his testimony			0
he had testified that the weather was clear the night of the killings , but another witness said it was overcast			0
a new defense witness who looked similar to @entity5 testified he was walking in the neighborhood at the time of the killings			1
the witness , @entity173 , " lived down the street from the @entity29 , " @entity95 told " @entity96			0
" " he was an uneasy sleeper and had a habit of walking the neighborhood at 3 in the morning			0
he often wore a beanie hat and he had a black members only jacket			0
" @entity173 's testimony , defense attorneys said , gave jurors the reasonable doubt they needed to acquit @entity5 in 1989			1
escaping death row as a newly freed man , @entity5 then re-enlisted in the @entity22 , eventually retiring in 2004 as a master sergeant			1
but prosecutors continued to pursue the case			2
in 2006 , vaginal swabs from a rape kit taken from @entity41 's body yielded new evidence			0
dna testing was an imperfect science in the 1980s , so the semen found in @entity41 's vagina was n't pursued as evidence during the first trial			0
but by the 2000s , technological advances in dna analysis had improved			0
experts said the dna from @entity110 's rape kit was consistent with @entity5 ' dna			2
@entity22 steps in a team of military attorneys evaluated the case and the @entity22 decided to pursue it			2
@entity5 was recalled to active duty two years after his retirement and promptly arrested on three counts of murder			1
" @entity215 is the only person in @entity217 history who 's been tried for his life three times after guilty and not guilty verdicts , " said @entity95 , whose book " @entity213 " was made into a 1996 tv movie			1
was n't @entity5 shielded by constitutional protections against so - called double jeopardy ? " in the simplest terms , if a defendant is acquitted and the prosecutor says to the judge , ' i want a do - over , ' that is clearly prohibited			1
that 's the definition of double jeopardy , " said @entity97 legal analyst @entity230			1
" but if a different prosecutor in a different court comes up with a different way to frame charges in the same crime , then that is generally permissible			0
" maj. @entity238 of the @entity22 @entity239 , who worked on the @entity5 case , told " @entity96 " that the military 's ability to prosecute a case that has already been tried is " well - settled law			1
nothing the state does actually effects what the federal government can do			0
" " in a very narrow category of cases where the federal government believes an injustice has been done , then federal prosecutors will step in , " @entity230 said			0
" but by and large , they operate in separate spheres			0
" when it came down to it , the prosecution 's case in @entity5 ' court - martial hinged on the dna testing results			1
" the sperm found in the vagina of mrs. @entity41 is the person who raped and slaughtered her and her children			0
and that 's @entity5 , " maj. @entity265 , another @entity266 attorney who worked on the case , told " @entity96			1
" the jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced @entity5 to death			1
he now sits in solitary confinement on death row at @entity275 military prison in @entity276 , awaiting appeal			1
but many unanswered questions remain			0
" there 's a ton of physical evidence in that house that they ca n't explain , " @entity95 told @entity97 's " @entity96			0
" a head hair was found in the @entity29 ' bed that is not @entity286 ' , @entity95 said			0
unidentified dna was found under @entity41 's fingernails			0
" we should be running that dna against our known database , " @entity95 said			0
" let 's find out what happened			0
" it likely will be a long time before the final page is written in this bizarre murder mystery			2
even after the appeals process is over , @entity5 can not be executed without presidential approval			2
in recent years , that has n't happened very often			0
the @entity217 military has not executed anyone from its ranks since 1961 .			1
