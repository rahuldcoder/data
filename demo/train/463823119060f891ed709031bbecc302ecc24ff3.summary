@entity0 , @entity1 -- the effort to place a massive containment dome over a gushing underwater wellhead in the @entity6 was dealt a setback when a large volume of hydrates -- icelike crystals that form when gas combines with water -- accumulated inside the vessel , a @entity9 official said saturday			1
the dome was moved off to the side of the wellhead and is resting on the seabed while crews work to overcome the challenge , a process expected to take at least two days , @entity9 's chief operations officer @entity16 said			1
@entity16 declined to call it a failed operation but said " what we attempted to do last night did n't work			2
" @entity16 said the gas hydrates are lighter than water and , as a result , made the dome buoyant			2
the crystals also blocked the top of the dome , which would prevent oil from being funneled up to a drill ship			1
" we did anticipate hydrates being a problem , but not this significant [ of one ] , " he said			0
also saturday , response crews discovered tar balls on a beach on @entity45 , @entity46 , and sent them to a lab to determine if they 're from the @entity49 oil slick			2
the analysis could take 48 hours to complete , the @entity50 said saturday			0
the tar balls , which a @entity54 @entity53 spokesman described as " pieces of emulsified oil " shaped like pancakes , ranged in size from dimes to golf balls			0
@entity62 balls can sometimes occur naturally , said the spokesman , @entity63			0
cleanup crews have placed snare boom -- a pompom shaped material designed to collect tar balls -- around @entity45			1
two options officials are looking at to resolve the problem are heating the dome or adding methanol to dissolve the hydrates , @entity16 said , adding that they are continuing to assess other methods to capturing the oil			1
the crude is leaking at a rate of 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels ) a day			2
@entity16 said that another possible solution would be to " take ground - up material of various types and try to inject it into the blowout preventer at the bottom of it and it will flow up and plug it up , " an operation he compared to stopping up a toilet			1
the maneuver is called a " junk shot , " @entity16 said			1
the blowout preventer is a 48 - foot - tall , 450 - ton apparatus that sits atop the well 5,000 feet underwater			1
it would stop the leak , @entity9 has said , but it has not been working properly since the @entity95 oil rig exploded in flames on april 20 and sank two days later , triggering an oil spill that president @entity98 has called a " potentially unprecedented environmental disaster			1
" @entity16 cautioned that a junk shot is not without risk or challenge , which is why crews have not yet attempted the method			1
meanwhile , hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the @entity6 coastline , and thousands of workers and volunteers diligently worked to skim the water 's surface			1
@entity16 said 17,500 barrels ( 735,000 gallons ) of oil - water mix were collected friday , and crews conducted five successful controlled burns			2
hopes were high for the success of the four - story containment dome , but officials had cautioned that the risky operation had never been tried at such a depth			1
" it 's a technology first , " @entity9 ceo @entity124 said friday			1
he said the dome works in 300 to 400 feet of water , " but the pressures and temperatures are very different here			2
so we can not be confident that it will work			2
" the arduous process takes time , @entity124 said			0
@entity133 , ceo of the environmental group @entity134 , said saturday she was n't counting on the operation to be successful			0
" i 'm praying for them to come up with anything , " she said			0
" in the meantime , though , we have to be realistic and we have to be planning , because it 's still a minimum of 5,000 barrels [ a day ] pouring out into the @entity6 until that thing is stopped			0
" if the hydrate problem is resolved , @entity9 , which owns the well , hopes to connect the dome to a drill ship over the weekend and to begin sucking oil from the containment dome up to the ship by the beginning of next week , @entity16 said friday			1
the stakes are high for residents of coastal @entity151 who make their living from fishing in the @entity6			0
oil washed ashore thursday on @entity151 's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the @entity156			0
" it 's killing everybody down here , everybody is more or less getting ulcers worrying about this , and it 's something we experienced five years ago with [ @entity166 ] @entity165 , " charter boat owner @entity167 told @entity2 saturday			0
" but we knew it was coming faster than this thing is and we do n't know what the long - term effect of what 's going to happen with this if it [ the oil ] does get up here			0
" on friday , the @entity174 said it has expanded the area closed to fishing to better reflect the spill 's location			0
the restriction , announced sunday , is being extended until may 17 , the agency said .			0

new : @entity9 officials considering " junk shot " of trying to clog blowout container with material
crystals accumulated inside containment dome , rendering it *ineffective*
@entity192 moved to side of wellhead while crews work to overcome the challenge , @entity9 ceo says
