-- at some companies , the night before a multibillion - dollar stock offering might come with lavish parties and champagne			1
at @entity6 , it will be work and @entity7			1
according to a rundown from @entity6 about the day leading up to friday 's initial stock offering , staffers will be all - hands - on - deck for the company 's 31st " hackathon " -- one of its all - night coding sessions that have become a @entity6 tradition since the company 's earliest days			1
" although all - nighters have been a @entity6 tradition since the beginning , we made hackathons official in 2007 , " the schedule says			1
it was provided to media due to intense interest in advance of the @entity28 debut			0
" they are all - night coding sessions where employees focus on any project they choose , with only one rule : it has to be different from their day job			1
" why @entity6 wo n't start trading at the opening bell life on planet @entity6 no assignments are handed out , and the prize for participation is a t - shirt			1
the casual wear ( which ceo @entity44 still embraces even when meeting with the suits in @entity46 ) has become a bit of a status symbol there			0
if you 've collected 31 t - shirts , it means you 've been hacking for the company since the old days			2
timeline : @entity44 's rise from child prodigy to @entity6 billionaire @entity58 , the " like " button and even an early version of @entity61 were devised during previous hackathons			1
" of course , no @entity6 event would be complete without food , so our culinary team will be providing snacks and meals throughout the night			2
we 'll also have some employees djing inside and ample @entity7 , " the schedule says			0
folks at @entity6 's @entity73 , @entity74 , headquarters will meet in " @entity75 , " where the word " hack " is built into the cement			2
employees at other locations will also be participating			0
are you living without @entity6 ? the hacker culture has long been engrained at @entity6 , a multinational corporation that famously has roots in a @entity85 dorm room			0
as @entity87 notes , @entity44 even used @entity89 filing papers as an opportunity for a sort of pro-hacker manifesto			0
" the word ' hacker ' has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers , " he wrote			0
" in reality , hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done			0
like most things , it can be used for good or bad , but the vast majority of hackers i 've met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world			0
" @entity6 's new billionaires we 'll withhold judgment until we see what comes out of this 't was - the - night - before - ipo hackathon			1
it 's clear @entity6 wants to stick to its roots , or to seem that way , even in the face of billions of dollars it 's likely to make on friday .			2

at @entity6 , all - night hacking will greet initial public offering of stock
the company 's 31st " hackathon " lets employees work on *pet* projects
@entity58 and the " like " button came from earlier hackathons
