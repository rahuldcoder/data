-- a letter of reprimand was sent to the 911 operator who handled the emergency call from a social worker seeking help as @entity8 killed his sons and himself in his @entity12 , @entity11 , home in february			1
it took eight minutes for 911 communications officer @entity14 to send a police car , and it took an additional 13 minutes for a police car to get to @entity8 's home , according to the letter released thursday			1
@entity14 violated several department policies and failed to recognize " many red flags " that should have led to a faster response , the reprimand said			1
@entity8 snatched the children from a social worker delivering them for a supervised visit , locked the doors and hacked them with a hatchet before an explosion engulfed his home february 5			1
the gas - fueled blast killed @entity8 and his sons , @entity33 , 7 , and @entity34 , 5 , a grisly end to a story that started with the 2009 disappearance of the boys ' mother			2
" you said that you have learned from this call to be more attentive to every caller and listen carefully to what they are saying and assuming nothing , " wrote @entity40 , the assistant director of the @entity41 , which operates the 911 call center			2
@entity14 was confused about how the social worker , who brought the two children to @entity8 's home for a supervised visit , " fit into the equation , " the letter said			1
" during the fact - finding you said that you were indeed confused and at first thought that the caller was the mother of the children , " @entity55 wrote			2
" you said that you regretted sounding contentious when you said ' you ca n't supervise yourself			0
' " the operator was also criticized for responding to the caller 's question of " how long will it be " with the answer " i do n't know ma'am , they have to respond to emergencies -- life threatening situations first			2
" his assumption that the caller was a mother involved in a custodial dispute contributed to the operator missing what " appeared to be many red flags , " @entity55 wrote			1
" when asked about this in the fact - finding you responded that custodial interference calls typically have heightened emotions and feel like emergencies to the person making the 911 call , " she wrote			0
" you further stated that you wished you had known who @entity8 was			0
" in march , investigators found @entity85 's blood inside the family 's @entity87 home and a handwritten will saying she feared for her life at the hands of her husband , court documents show			0
the documents offered a glimpse of the evidence authorities collected that put @entity8 at the center of the investigation into her december , 2009 , disappearance			0
the reprimand regarding the 911 call also listed factors that were beyond @entity14 's control			1
the 911 computers have a system to quickly identify addresses known to be related to problems , but there was no " premise hazard " information for @entity8 's home despite his history			1
this " would have alerted you and the dispatcher to the need for a heightened response , " the letter said			0
the appropriate discipline should be corrective , not punitive , the letter concluded			0
" you have undergone local and national scrutiny , have admitted your errors , and have identified the ways you will correct and improve your call handling in the future , " @entity55 wrote .			0
