is @entity0 a liar ? turns out the @entity3 senator and gubernatorial hopeful had some help paying for her @entity7 education ( though she never said she did n't )			1
turns out , too , that @entity9 ' two children spent most of their time back in @entity3 while @entity9 got that education ( though she never said they had n't )			1
she claimed she was 19 when she divorced , but the truth appears to be that she was separated at 19 and divorced at 21 ( busted ! )			1
and though she 's told stories about the difficulties of time spent living in a trailer with her daughter , a recent @entity16 article might lead us to ask , is that so bad ? ! she lived in that trailer " only a few months			2
" for these errors , @entity9 has been branded a liar , a whore and a terrible mother			2
no matter , one could argue that her embellishments are no worse than those of the average politician , or , for that matter , any 50 - year - old recounting details of events that happened some 30 years earlier -- not that anyone 's asking male politicians whether their wives helped pay for their education , or who watched the kids while they were off supporting the family			1
" so @entity47 had a @entity48 , " tweeted @entity44 pundit @entity43 , referring to @entity9 ' filibuster last year of an anti-abortion bill			0
@entity51 @entity50 @entity49 tweeted , " @entity0 has solved @entity53 's student loan crisis ! just find a dumbass to pay off your loans in exchange for sex			1
" @entity59 weighed in with a somewhat less vitriolic but no less pointed jab at @entity9 and her then - husband 's decision to have her daughters stay home with him in @entity3 while she attended law school : " gosh , " wrote @entity59 , " children are sooo inconvenient , huh ? " while @entity9 has conceded that she inaccurately represented , if only slightly , a few facts concerning her background — or , at least , allowed the media to do so for her — the controversy surrounding her candidacy is n't about whether or not she is too untrustworthy to serve as governor as her detractors would have you believe			1
it 's about whether she 's too female			0
consider that male politicians , and men in other big jobs , leave their families for days or weeks at a time in order to earn their best living			2
or that it 's not unusual for husbands to go through school with support , financial and otherwise , from their spouses			2
and let 's be honest : would people accept @entity9 as a legitimate candidate for @entity3 governor if she had skipped school in favor of staying home with her kids ? if she had not become a lawyer or a senator but instead spent her days driving carpool ? no. no more than we 'd consider asking our male candidates how they had the audacity not to choose to be stay - at - home dads			1
this is n't a debate over @entity9 ' values , but rather a reminder that she is a woman , and that a woman 's place is at home			0
the digs here are n't about her character or her politics			0
they 're about her gender , and the fact that voters continue to want their female candidates smarter , sharper and more unimpeachable than their male ones -- and to have stayed home with the kids , too			0
this is a prejudice that 's not even rooted in truth , since a number of studies have found that children raised in single - father homes fare just as well as those in single - mother homes			2
still , this controversy could be the best thing that 's happened for @entity9 , and for female politicians in general			0
with every blatantly misogynistic conservative view spewed into the discourse , female voters become more acutely aware of , and angry about , society 's enduring sexism			0
the @entity50 's " war on women " has directly impacted votes , and not in a small way			0
in a @entity148 poll conducted shortly before the 2012 election — and not long after events like @entity153 's comments about " legitimate rape " and the right - wing smearing of attorney and activist @entity157 — 60 % of women said government policies on birth control would be extremely or very important in influencing their vote			1
so go ahead , @entity161 and @entity162 of the world			0
call @entity0 or any other female politician a " whore " and a " bad mother " enough and @entity53 women will start to wonder what you think about them			1
which , of course , is n't very much .			0

@entity174 : @entity0 , running for governor in @entity3 , had *discrepancies* in her *bio*
was she divorced at 19 or 21 , did husband help pay for school , how long did she live in trailer / ?
@entity174 : in misogynistic attacks , right wing calling her " whore , " worse . men not treated this way
@entity174 : *double* - *standard* smears will help , not hurt
