-- it was n't so long ago that orange fell off the home decor color wheel			1
after a decade of being associated with popular appliance colors like " avocado green " and " harvest gold " ( ah , the ' 70s ) , orange became outdated and was quietly dropped from the roster			2
but , as @entity10 , the president of the @entity11 points out , a color as bold as orange is never gone for good			1
the @entity11 forecasts the colors major industries , manufacturers and services will use one to three years in advance			0
) in recent home decor trends such as " modern global " and the @entity23 revival , orange has been a key player in shades of pumpkin , cinnabar , terra cotta , vermillion and coral			0
" the beauty of orange is its energetic appeal in almost all of its values , " @entity10 said			1
especially in its brighter spectrum , orange is considered fun , upbeat and unique , he said			1
but even as colors come and go in popular use ( orange is already beginning to cycle down in popularity , with cooler blues taking the forefront in design and color news ) , orange always comes to mind as the weather cools down			1
" @entity52 decorating will often take its clues from the natural world , " @entity10 said			1
" as leaves change color , we are introduced to a collection of reds , browns , golds and , of course , oranges			1
of them all , the orange seems most to be the last vestige of summer joy			0
so it becomes a bridge color , hovering between the golds and browns with a hint of the past season marrying the coming season			2
" perhaps it wo n't be so easy to let go of our orange decor as fabric and furniture trends continue to evolve , @entity10 said			1
while orange is the natural complement to the brand new blues soon to be seen in the home furnishing aisles of major retailers , the real future of the hue , @entity10 said , is metallic : think " copper			1
" " it is poised to be the metal to embrace in coming years and will keep orange alive , " he said			0
" in the end , orange has been embraced by so many that we wo n't want to see it go , " @entity10 said			1
" it may step back for a bit and become more subtle , but we will always want its bit of fun and energy			1
" want to add orange to your home 's color palette ? here are anecdotes and advice from this week 's @entity109 contributors : take inexpensive risks " if you 're afraid to use color in your home , choose an inexpensive way to add color like pillows or bedding			1
these things can be replaced ( more ) easily and effortlessly than , say , an expensive orange couch or chair			0
using neutral elements like gray curtains and white walls gives a bold color a resting place so that the room is n't too overwhelming			2
it also keeps the look fresh			0
" -- @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 less is more " pair orange with cooler colors , and use it more as an accent to add a small dose			2
it also works well with metals : copper , gold and brass			0
with black or darker colors , orange can be a bit too ' heavy			0
' " -- @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 mix it up " my husband loves bright orange , not the muted fall orange , because bright orange is represented in his school colors			0
i fell in love with the color , too , and wanted it somewhere else in our home			2
i love the combo of pink , gold and orange , and that 's what inspired me to paint the little box under our coffee table in that color combination			2
it is eye catching to say the least			0
while it 's not for everyone , i have to say that i love it			0
