-- mayors @entity2 of @entity4 , @entity5 of @entity6 , @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 , each attended public schools in the cities they now lead			1
this month , they launched a tour to meet educators , families and innovators in each of their cities , with the hope of understanding their shared problems -- and potential for solutions			1
" education is more than a quality of life issue			1
education impacts everything that we do in the city			1
it really is a fundamental right and it 's a path out of poverty , " @entity10 said			1
" we 're working to see what 's going on in each other 's city and to share solutions and help adapt them to our own city			1
" they hope to take home lessons learned in each city in order to address gaps between wealthier areas with great schools and poorer neighborhoods where schools struggle			2
the tour will continue through march			2
" we have an achievement gap between children of color and white kids that quite frankly , if we do n't address and begin to address effectively with some sense of urgency , will threaten the real vitality and freedoms of this country , " @entity5 said			0
here are lessons the four mayors learned by working with their cities ' schools -- and through their own experiences as students			1
not all a 's are created equal before he was mayor of @entity8 , @entity7 had gotten a basketball scholarship to @entity65 and thought he was a good student , he said			1
but during his freshman year at @entity67 , @entity7 realized that getting @entity68 's in high school did n't mean he was prepared for college			1
" i was in an @entity72 class with 30 kids and they were all talking about a word -- the word was ' euphemism ' -- and 29 of those kids knew what the word meant , " @entity7 said			0
" i was the only kid who did not know the word ' euphemism ' and i remember thinking , ' am i in the wrong class ? ' " @entity7 realized then that an a in one school might not equal to an a in another , and even students with good grades can be in for a rude awakening when they go to college			2
( after graduating from @entity65 , @entity7 went on to play twelve seasons with the @entity93 and the @entity94			0
) " far too often a child 's educational outcomes are determined by her or his zip code , and that 's the case in @entity8 , too , and this has led to an unacceptable achievement gap , " @entity7 said , describing how slow they 've been to close the gap between white and black students ' scores			2
" @entity6 mayor @entity5 described a similar experience			2
" i got into college , as well as many of my peers , and we realized we were not where we needed to be , we were behind some of our peers , " he said			0
" so we had to do special classes and programming to get caught up and really put in the extra effort			0
" he struggled with writing and math early in college , he said , which makes him consider what hard - to - spot problems might exist in @entity6 's schools			2
" that 's where we begin to see some of the cracks and some of the gaps that may not be as apparent in the primary system , " said @entity5 , who is an advocate of school choice			1
" families should be able to pursue the best possible educational opportunity that is available to them , no matter where that opportunity exists in the city , " teachers can change lives @entity4 mayor @entity2 was just a few years into his school career when he began to understand the power of a good teacher			1
" in the first or second grade , i had a teacher who gave me extra homework to do and she explained that she had confidence that i could do the extra work and that made me feel great about myself , " @entity2 said			0
" i got to excel in school and that was the beginning of my feeling good about achieving academically			2
" @entity11 mayor @entity10 said he became a lawyer because his third - grade teacher , mrs. @entity150 , told him he could			1
" she was someone who asked me what i wanted to be when i grow up and i told her that i wanted to be a lawyer			0
she asked me ' why ? ' and i told her that i wanted to help people			0
she made me repeat it to anyone and everyone who would listen , " @entity10 said			0
the same teacher suggested @entity10 test for a gifted program , which allowed him to take more intense math classes , and eventually led him to a more challenging school			2
it 's never too early to start learning @entity10 , himself a graduate of the early childhood education program @entity166 , said he has worked to improve early childhood literacy in his city by introducing programs such as @entity170			1
the program aims to close the " word gap			0
" research shows low - income children hear millions fewer words in the early years of their lives than their peers in middle - or upper - income homes			0
the program provides low - income children with recording devices that count the words they 're exposed to each , and coaching parents and caregivers on how to improve their children 's vocabularies			0
the devices work in several languages , including @entity72 and @entity188 , and is expected to launch in 2014			0
@entity170 was the winner of the $ 5 million @entity190 , a contest created by @entity193 mayor @entity192 to draw out ideas from city leaders			1
@entity2 described how @entity4 residents had recently voted to fund full - day pre-kindergarten for more than 22,000 of the city 's 4 - year - olds over the next eight years			1
@entity2 said he hopes it will prevent students from falling behind , experiencing the frustration of falling behind and perhaps dropping out			0
children 's educations can begin even before they 're enrolled in school , he said			1
" one of the biggest challenges is ensuring that students are prepared when they start school , " @entity2 said			0
" we have so many young people who are not read to and they 're not prepared when they start pre- k. "			0
