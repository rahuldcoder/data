@entity16 @entity15 held on to the race leader 's yellow jersey after claiming it the previous day from @entity21 teammate @entity20 of @entity22			1
@entity1 , who has already taken a stranglehold on the green points jersey he won for the first time in last year 's @entity6 , has been denied victory on four previous stages , but made no mistake this time after superb work from his @entity31 team			1
they pushed on after the second of the day 's climb which left other star sprinters such as @entity36 of @entity37 and @entity10 's @entity38 , winner of stage six , trailing			2
they came home in an 84 - strong group nearly 15 minutes down , leaving @entity1 to pay his compliments to his helpers			0

" even if it 's not an ideal stage for me , i 'll keep on trying			0
" we did a lot of work on the second climb and we dropped the sprinters and the team started to believe that we could do well			0
" @entity15 , the first @entity16 to don the yellow jersey , admitted it had been tough to hold on to it			1
" there was a moment on the second climb that the pressure was on , but we handled it pretty well , " he said			0
" but i was happy to see the top of that climb , that 's for sure			0
" @entity1 now has a lead of over 100 points in the battle for green , but saturday will see the race for yellow hot up as the peloton hit the @entity71 for the first time in the eighth stage over 195km from @entity74 to @entity75			1
