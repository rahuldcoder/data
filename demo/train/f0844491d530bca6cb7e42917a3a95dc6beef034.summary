-- when @entity2 lacrosse player @entity1 would feel exhausted and defeated during one of her home games in @entity5 , @entity6 , a quick look over to coach @entity8 would change her perspective , and her determination			1
" he makes you want to do better and push yourself harder and give it your all because if he could , he would be doing that			2
and he is doing it , because he comes out here in his condition			2
" @entity8 uses a wheelchair , the result of @entity21 , or @entity21 , which is also referred to as @entity23 's disease			1
it is a neurodegenerative disease in which the brain progressively loses the ability to control muscle movement			1
the life expectancy of someone with @entity21 is on average two to five years , with their condition worsening over that time to a possible full paralysis			1
@entity8 can still hold his head up , breathe and give his girls the advice and sarcasm they expect			2
his mind is still as sharp and as witty as ever			0
but it has been difficult for players like @entity40 to see his physical decline			0
" i was 10 years old when he started coaching me and it 's just hard to see someone you care for have to go through such a struggle every day of his life			1
" but the girls on his team did not shy away from the heartbreak of what their coach was going through			1
they embraced it with him , making it part of their lives			0
they researched als and when they learned that there was no cure , they became committed to helping raise money for the @entity63			1
their school and community were soon barraged by bake sales , silent auctions , fundraisers and @entity21 awareness events			1
the girls formed their own " walk to defeat @entity21 " team , and to help @entity8 with his medical expenses , they started an annual 5k run called " @entity77			1
" coach @entity8 's team they also pushed to make a difference in @entity8 's home life , bringing meals to his house , hosting " @entity87 " and showing up for visits during the off - season			1
on the field , @entity87 began to take on a different meaning			0
seasons were dedicated to @entity8 , and the team 's rallying cry was for him			1
they would each wear a red sock on their left leg in his honor			0
@entity8 would give them a sarcastic remark , but @entity40 knew him well enough to see he appreciated their help			0
" i think he is definitely the first one to tell you that he does n't want all the attention , he just wants us to think of it as his challenge that he has to overcome			0
but i think it really helped us become a year - round team , because in the off - season we are raising money for @entity21 and we 've just become so close that we 've now become a family			1
" some girls on the team , like @entity113 , realized that choosing to get closer to someone succumbing to @entity21 is worth it , even at their young age			1
" @entity8 's the first person that i 've ever had to watch slip away from me , and it 's been hard on me , but i also know that his experience has transformed me into who i am			1
so even when his physical presence is n't with us anymore , it 's always going to be a part of me			1
that i can carry him with me so other people can see what he was like by seeing what he did to me			0
" @entity8 's journey @entity8 did not have a choice about @entity21			1
it was a burden thrown his way , which he took on without complaint , but with plenty of sarcasm			0
his team says you would know something was bothering @entity8 if he would not joke about it , so he made sure his als was a regular punch line for all to hear			1
but you would n't hear @entity8 complain that life was n't fair			0
he did n't even get to choose lacrosse , the sport that he says drives him crazy			1
" i do n't hate girls ' lacrosse			1
it 's just the rules are so frustrating			1
i got into it because my daughter was playing , and they said they just needed an adult to stand on the sideline and shuffle kids in and out of the game			0
i told them i did n't know anything about lacrosse , and they took that for a yes			1
" when @entity8 found out he had @entity21 , he stopped working and thought he was finished coaching			1
but parents would call , saying their daughters would only stick with the sport if he would still coach them			2
so he continued as best as he could			0
as his muscles became weaker , he moved from using a cane to sitting in a golf cart on the field			2
this cart became a popular destination for the girls to hang out and talk about their boy problems			0
@entity8 says he was a trapped confidant			0
" so i kind of became the team mom , and with a bunch of teenage girls , when you ca n't go anywhere and you 're surrounded , it 's a little frustrating , because you hear stuff you do n't want to hear			1
" so there he was , coaching a game he did n't really like , having to listen to all this high school girl drama , and knowing that these were hours of a shortening life that he was not sharing with his family			0
then these lacrosse girls pushed even closer			2
they made a big deal about his als , and they would even show up at his house during the off - season , and watch his tv			0
you might expect some frustration			0
but for @entity8 , this became his salvation			0
through all this , he did have one choice : whether he was going to share his journey of @entity21			1
no one would fault him for keeping the pain and embarrassment of his condition to just his family			0
people would understand the desire to face your own mortality in private			0
but @entity8 chose to share his journey			0
he let the girls get close and help carry the load			0
he does n't fully understand why he means so much to these girls , but being needed helps him get up each day			0
changing his attitude is one of the few things @entity8 can still do			0
he references a quote from @entity214 , another @entity6 high school coach suffering from @entity21			1
" he said everybody has difficulties , and it 's like the wind			2
you ca n't control the wind but you can adjust your sails , and i actually told the girls that , and this being able to come out here with them , it 's like that 's what i do to adjust my sails , because they give me something to get up and look forward to			2
" a year ago , the @entity87 team got to the state championship finals , and lost			2
at the end of this season , they were back in the championship match , ready to finally win it for @entity8			0
both times the team was feeling dejected , until @entity8 broke the silence			2
@entity113 remembers it clearly : " he was the first one after the game to come up to us and be , like , it 's not the @entity249 , that 's not what it was about			2
it 's about the journey that we 've been on together and the experiences that we 've shared together			2
" he also sarcastically added that because they lost , he now has to come out for yet another season			0
with that , the team knew they had really won .			2
