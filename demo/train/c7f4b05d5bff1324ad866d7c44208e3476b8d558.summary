-- an @entity2 cruise line has said it " deeply regrets " the deaths of two @entity5 fishermen amid claims that one of its cruise ships failed to help their stranded boat			1
@entity11 said passengers on the @entity13 apparently alerted a crew member to the disabled fishing boat in march , but initial indications are that the captain was never told			1
later that month , the @entity19 navy rescued the only survivor of what was meant to be an overnight fishing trip , 18 - year - old @entity23 , after 28 days adrift			1
since then , pressure has grown on the cruise line from local and international media to explain why it failed to help			1
broadcaster @entity27 first reported the claim by three passengers , all bird - watchers , that they had spotted the castaways and told cruise ship staff but had seen no action taken			1
a reporter with the @entity5 - @entity37 website confirmed with @entity23 that he and his two friends , who at that point were still alive , had tried to attract the attention of the passing cruise ship			1
@entity11 " deeply regrets that two @entity5 men perished at sea , " its statement thursday said			1
" the preliminary results of our investigation have shown that there appeared to be a breakdown in communication in relaying the passenger 's concern			2
neither captain @entity55 nor the officer of the watch were notified , " it said			0
" understandably , captain @entity55 is devastated that he is being accused of knowingly turning his back on people in distress			2
" if @entity55 had received the information , he would have been able to respond appropriately , the company said			0
" we all understand that it is our responsibility and also the law of the sea to provide assistance to any vessel in distress , and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea , " it said			2
its ships have been involved in more than 30 rescues in the past decade , @entity11 added			1
the story of @entity23 's miraculous survival gained international coverage when he was picked up north of the @entity83			2
the alert was first raised by @entity23 's parents after he and his two friends , @entity87 , 24 , and @entity88 , 16 , failed to return as expected to the town of @entity90 , @entity5			1
local fishermen and then the @entity5 navy joined the search , sending ships and airplanes to look for the trio , to no avail			0
for nearly a month , their fate remained a mystery			0
but on march 21 , fishermen spotted the boat , named the @entity102 , adrift nearly 600 miles from where it had launched			2
after being alerted by the fishermen , the @entity19 navy rescued @entity107			0
rear adm. @entity108 said @entity23 showed " severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition " when he was found			2
he said the survivor had thrown his friends ' bodies into the ocean " because they had become badly decomposed			0
" @entity23 's mother , @entity118 , told @entity0 last month that she was overjoyed to have her son back			1
" after 28 days of anguish , after praying to @entity122 that he be found alive ... this is indeed a miracle , " @entity120 said			1
she said her son told her the february 24 fishing trip had started out well			0
the three caught plenty of fish			0
but the boat 's engine died without warning and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , there was little the trio could do , @entity120 told @entity0			0
soon , currents had swept their boat out into the @entity138 , far from the coast			0
@entity140 said the three ate raw fish and drank rainwater			0
they had already been adrift for two weeks when passengers on the @entity13 apparently spotted their tiny boat as the fishermen waved for help			1
@entity0 's @entity148 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 is investigating what happened after passengers raised the alert
one of its cruise ships is accused of failing to come to the aid of the *stricken* vessel
cruise line : a communication breakdown meant the captain was *n't* told of the boat
a sole survivor , @entity23 , 18 , was eventually rescued after 28 days adrift
