-- @entity2 's president called on @entity4 officials to stop gun trafficking across the border thursday , saying the move would be the best thing @entity4 could do to stop brutal drug violence			1
" the criminals have become more and more vicious in their eagerness to spark fear and anxiety in society , " president @entity10 said			2
" one of the main factors that allows criminals to strengthen themselves is the unlimited access to high - powered weapons , which are sold freely , and also indiscriminately , in the @entity4			1
" speaking in @entity20 , the border city across from @entity21 , @entity22 , that has become @entity2 's murder capital , @entity10 said a dramatic increase in violence in @entity2 was directly connected with the 2004 expiration of the @entity4 assault weapons ban			1
the @entity2 president has asked @entity4 lawmakers to renew the ban on assault weapons before , most notably in a 2010 speech to the @entity34			1
but the backdrop thursday was dramatically different			0
@entity10 stood in front of a massive new sign , constructed with tons of decommissioned arms			2
" no more weapons , " the sign said -- in @entity41			0
americans on the other side of the border are the intended audience , @entity10 said			0
" from here , from @entity20 , on the border of @entity2 and the @entity4 , we say , ' no more weapons			1
no more weapons to @entity2 , ' " he said			0
thursday 's speech came as a @entity4 congressional inquiry continues into " @entity53 , " an operation run by @entity4 federal agents			0
authorities have said the operation was intended to track the flow of illegally purchased @entity4 guns to the @entity2 cartels -- but in practice , agents from the @entity61 allowed so - called straw buyers to take weapons across the border without being intercepted			1
@entity10 praised @entity4 president @entity67 's efforts to deal with the " very sensitive issue " of assault weapons , noting that officials in his administration had done more than previous leaders to investigate and block illegal weapons trafficking to @entity2			1
" they have taken positive steps , but we all know that unfortunately it is not enough , and we can not stop here , " he said			0
out of 140,000 weapons @entity2 authorities have seized since @entity10 declared a crackdown on cartels at the beginning of his presidency , 84,000 were high - powered assault weapons , @entity10 said			1
more than 47,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence in @entity2 since december 2006 , according to government statistics			2
during his thursday speech , @entity10 looked toward the border and said he had a message for @entity4			2
" we need your help to stop this violence			0
we need you to reduce your consumption of drugs and to dramatically reduce the flow of money to criminal organizations in @entity2 , " he said			0
" but beyond the topic of drugs , the best way that you , the @entity4 people , can help reduce the violence in @entity2 is through legislation that has already been in force in the @entity4 , blocking the inhumane weapons trafficking into our country			2
" @entity0 's @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0
