-- you know about the obvious impacts of the government shutdown : federal workers idled , offices closed , funding disrupted for all sorts of activities			1
but some of the impacts are less obvious , more outrageous , or a little bit of both			2
here 's a sampling of some of the spinoff effects of the shutdown showdown in @entity16 : @entity17 defends $ 5 million for high - end glassware shuttered websites in the digital equivalent of throwing a sheet over unused furniture , many federal agencies have replaced their websites and all the information on them with static pages announcing the government shutdown			1
whether a website will be up or not , however , is something of a guessing game			2
the @entity32 site is down			2
it sends visitors to the @entity36 's website , which is up but not being updated			2
the @entity41 website is up , but the website for its subordinate agency , the @entity42 , greets visitors with a stark white page reading , " due to the lapse in federal funding , this @entity39 ( @entity39 ) website is unavailable			1
" that you can still reach the websites mean the computers that serve the data are still up and running , and the government is either paying a private company to operate them or they 're using taxpayer - funded power to continue running			1
but it does n't matter if running the sites with big " closed " sign draped across the front costs the same or even more than letting them run , the @entity56 said in a september 17 memo to federal employees			1
" the determination of which services continue during an appropriations lapse is not affected by whether the costs of shutdown exceed the costs of maintaining services , " according to the memo			2
icing @entity71 research while @entity72 has the okay to keep supporting @entity74 astronauts at the @entity75 , the same apparently is n't true of scientists at what may be the @entity74 ' next most desolate outpost : @entity71			1
the @entity79 said wednesday that it would run out of money to keep the @entity81 going by october 14			2
so it 's putting the program into " caretaker status , " leaving research stations and other facilities staffed with only the bare number of people necessary to " ensure human safety and preserve government property , " the agency said			1
that means many of the scientists who would be heading to the program 's @entity71 research stations to work over the @entity95 's summer , which begins in december and runs february , are in limbo			1
the agency says it will try to restart the research program once funding resumes , but says that it could be tough once seasonal workers are let go and the seasonal window to do some of the work has passed			1
emptiest catch the shutdown also could make its way to your seafood dinner plate			0
without federal employees to set rules and quotas for the fishing season , crab fleets in @entity109 are in limbo -- unsure whether they 'll be able to head out in pursuit of lucrative crab that bring in millions of dollars each season			1
a delay of even a few days could be costly , rep. @entity118 , @entity119 , said in a @entity56 speech last week			0
her district includes the home port for some of the fleets that fish for @entity127 crab			1
what you need to know today " a delay could mean they 'll miss out exporting to the all - important @entity133 holiday market when demand is at its highest and most lucrative , " she said			0
that could cost the industry millions , dealing it what she called a " crippling blow			0
" one fishing captain told @entity0 affiliate @entity143 that the delay threatens what they call the " @entity145 of crab fishing			0
" " we think of a lot of other things besides the government affecting our fishing -- weather , boats , crew , " said capt. @entity147 of the fishing vessel @entity148			0
" this has really caught us off guard			0
" no shutdown for @entity56 gym rats move along , nothing to see no , the @entity164 administration has not deployed helicopters to hover in front of @entity167 with a giant , view - obscuring sheet , as the rumor - busting site snopes.com debunked last week			0
but federal officials did -- for a time at least -- put traffic cones up at a pull - off where people stop to view the carving from a distance			1
depending on whom you ask , the cones were either to block motorists from pulling off or to guide them into viewing areas			0
" they wo n't even let you pull off on the side of the road , " the @entity183 newspaper in @entity184 , @entity185 , quoted state @entity187 secretary @entity186 as saying			1
" i just do n't know what they 're trying to accomplish			1
" the newspaper said park officials told the state the cones were meant only to channel motorists into viewing sites			0
they went up october 1 , the day the shutdown began			0
federal officials removed the cones for at least a while after a snowstorm hit and crews needed to plow the roads , the newspaper reported			2
" once the snow 's off the ground , we 're going to be keeping an eye on how the cones go up , " the newspaper quoted the governor 's chief of staff , @entity208 , as saying			0
on shutdown 's 9th day , survivors of fallen troops take center stage do n't go in there the area around the @entity220 is a ghost town			1
it 's no different inside , and park rangers are working to keep it that way , according to @entity227 newspaper in @entity228			2
park officials have written about two dozen citations for people trying to sneak into the park			1
some have been caught at the canyon 's @entity220 , others on trails or attempting hikes , the newspaper reported			1
shutdown leaves ranchers in the cold , blizzard kills their cattle do n't ' recreate ' according to the @entity244 newspaper of @entity245 , @entity246 , tourist @entity247 said @entity248 held her tour group under armed guard in a @entity253 hotel and brusquely told tourists who had filed off their bus to take pictures of bison that they were n't to " recreate			2
" the tour guide argued to rangers that the tourists -- some of them from overseas -- were n't " recreating , " just taking pictures			1
" she responded and said , ' sir , you are recreating , ' and her tone became very aggressive , " the newspaper quoted @entity247 as saying			0
@entity253 spokesman @entity267 , who despite being furloughed was asked by park officials to respond to some media inquiries when available , said hotel guests were never held under armed guard			0
he acknowledged that tourists were frustrated by limitations imposed by the shutdown -- he said parks officials were , as well			0
@entity276 : @entity278 ' new bogeyman and stay out ! a @entity281 couple said they were kicked out of their home in the @entity283 , @entity0 affiliate @entity279 reports			2
retirees @entity285 and @entity286 own a cabin on federal land , and were told last week they had 24 hours to clear out and stay out until the government reopens			1
park officials gave @entity279 a statement saying overnight stays are not allowed in the park until funding is restored , but said owners can visit their properties to retrieve belongings			0
while the decision has angered some commenters on @entity279 's story -- some of whom suggested the decision to kick out property owners was made out of spite and encouraged the couple to sue -- @entity307 said they 're taking the situation in stride			0
while they 'd like to be allowed back in their home , the worst impact has been that she had to buy her husband new clothes they forgot while packing up to leave their cabin			0
" we 're not hurt in any way except it might cost me if i have to go buy more pants , " she told @entity279			0
@entity325 worries : can it count on @entity74 ?			0

new : some websites down , others up ; @entity71 research program iced
rangers are *ticketing* people who try to sneak into the @entity220
@entity335 ca n't fish without federal permits
