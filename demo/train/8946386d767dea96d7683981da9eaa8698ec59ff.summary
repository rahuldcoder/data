like many of his counterparts across the world , @entity1 prime minister @entity0 was quick to stand with @entity6 in the wake of the deadly attack on the offices of @entity6 satirical magazine @entity10			1
while most people in @entity1 were equally disgusted by the events in @entity14 , others felt it was preventable			1
@entity17 lawmaker @entity16 wrote an opinion piece claiming the magazine was " virtually inviting a reaction week after week			0
" @entity21 , a politician and former senior police officer , tweeted : " @entity6 terror - shoot - out sends a message : why deliberately provoke or poke ? be respectful and civil			0
do n't hurt people 's sensitivities ! " but in a post on its @entity32 page , the country 's @entity33 , or the " @entity33 " that just swept state elections in @entity28 in an unprecedented victory , pointed to an issue much closer to home			1
" a lot of you have expressed shock at the attack on satirists @entity10 and have shared some of their cartoons as well			1
but did you know that doing so can get you jailed here in @entity1 ? " the use of controversial cartoons had reignited a furious debate about freedom of expression in the world 's most populous democracy			1
take the case of @entity54			0
in 2012 , the chemistry professor was arrested for circulating by email a cartoon that poked fun at @entity60 chief minister @entity59			0
the cartoon , which was a parody of a scene in a popular @entity1 movie , went viral on social media			1
he was charged with a range of offenses including defamation , insulting a woman and sending offensive messages from a computer			2
@entity54 called the charges a misuse of the law " in the name of surveillance , to curb democratic rights , freedom of speech and human rights of common people			2
" cyber law in @entity1 stipulates that alleged offenders could face up to three years in jail for posting material that is " grossly offensive , " has " menacing character , " -- or perhaps even more ambiguously -- causes " annoyance or inconvenience			1
" @entity28 went one step further in its digital crackdown in 2011			0
the so - called " intermediary guidelines " implicated web platforms themselves			0
the rules now require @entity95 companies to take down any content seen as " disparaging , " " blasphemous , " or " defamatory " within 36 hours of a user submitting a formal request for removal			0
in @entity102 , @entity1 's financial center , police spokesman @entity100 told @entity5 that some 650 posts and pages were blocked last year under these regulations			1
@entity106 says that in the last half of 2013 , it removed 540 items from its pages in compliance with orders issued by @entity1 courts , government agencies , and law enforcement			1
it 's a similar story with @entity32			1
the social networking site took down nearly 5,000 pieces of content reported by the @entity1 government in the first half of 2014			1
meanwhile , @entity121 -- an @entity1 equivalent of @entity123 , which allows online users to write reviews of products and services -- has taken its case to the country 's @entity129 to protect what it says are the rights of @entity1 citizens and consumers enshrined by the @entity1 constitution			2
a number of companies had objected to negative feedback and applied to have comments removed under the guise of " harmful speech " in current legislation			0
the question marks over @entity1 's internet freedom come at a time when @entity0 is planning to splash out $ 17 billion to build a fiber optic " broadband highway " that will cover the entire country			1
if the prime minister 's ambitious plan bears fruit , more than a billion @entity1 will be surfing the web for the first time within three years			2
but a rapid rise in access to the web potentially exposes millions of ordinary @entity1 to a new threat			2
" schemes like this will bring the bulk of @entity1 communications online and therefore , open to interception , unless we regulate this before we start			2
unless we have proper laws , " said constitutional lawyer @entity166			0
ultimately @entity1 is an important case study in how developing markets deal with regulating an increasingly connected society			2
" a lot of people do n't see the relationship between free speech and privacy , " explained @entity166			0
" but when you survey communications and intercept private communications ... this has a chilling effect on free speech			0
" in 2013 , the @entity1 government rolled out the @entity182 , a mass surveillance system capable of intercepting all phone and internet - based communications			1
@entity186 warned of its potential to threaten civilian rights , given the @entity1 government 's " reckless and irresponsible use of the sedition and @entity95 laws			1
" as of the time of writing , @entity1 's telecom minister had not responded to multiple requests for comment on this issue			2
later this year , an internet surveillance mechanism called @entity201 -- an acronym for network traffic analysis -- is expected to go live			0
its exact functions have n't yet been spelled out by the government , but @entity166 pointed to its possible use as a tool for untargeted , dragnet surveillance			2
the @entity211 -- reportedly the architect of @entity201 -- has refused to comment on the project			0
where privacy rules dovetail with @entity0 's digital aspirations is especially troubling			0
" if you have @entity220 and @entity201 hand - in - hand -- in effect , what this scheme will become is a large , massive surveillance project , " warned @entity166			0
it 's not all necessarily bad news for @entity1 's future internet users			2
in the latest freedom on the @entity228 report , of all 65 countries surveyed , @entity1 showed the biggest improvement worldwide where internet freedom was concerned			1
relaxed restrictions on access and content -- plus a drop in the number of arrests for social media posts -- pushed @entity1 up in the rankings			1
behind the gains -- the country was not , as regularly , calling into action its existing internet controls			0
so , it was n't that policy was being reformed ; it 's that these controversial provisions were being called upon with less frequency than in past years			0
a more lenient approach was reinforced only last week when additional solicitor general @entity250 -- @entity1 's third most senior law officer -- said posts made " on any internet medium which were not grossly offensive would not be treated as a criminal act			1
" in effect , that could mean dramatically reduced restrictions over what can be freely said in posts made on social media sites such as @entity32 and @entity261			1
but ultimately , the government is bound only by its written submissions , so it remains to be seen whether these verbal concessions will find their place in ink in the @entity1 penal code			1
for now , this spate of embroiled cyber legislation is under deliberation in the country 's highest court			0
cyber security expert , @entity274 , will be among those looking to see where the anvil falls on digital freedoms			0
for him , the answer is simple : " let society or the legal system decide what must be seen on the @entity95 , not the state or the police			0

attack on @entity10 reignited a furious debate about freedom of expression in @entity1
offenders can be jailed for posting material that is " grossly offensive , " causes " annoyance or inconvenience "
@entity32 took down nearly 5,000 posts reported by the @entity1 government in the first half of 2014
