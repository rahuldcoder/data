@entity0 , @entity1 a long walk for justice will end soon for nine @entity6 men who pioneered the " jail , no bail " strategy during the lunch counter protests of the civil rights movement			1
the men , dubbed the @entity13 after the @entity0 , @entity1 , college that eight of them attended , were looking to make a statement about the plight of the segregated @entity1			1
and that 's just what they did			2
on wednesday , the attorney who represented the men almost 5Â½ decades ago is scheduled to return to court to have their names cleared			1
in a poetic twist , @entity26 judge @entity25 , who will preside over the hearing , is the nephew of the judge who originally sentenced these largely unsung civil rights heroes			1
the prosecutor who pushed for this momentous day , 16th circuit solicitor @entity31 of @entity0 , leans on a quote from the rev. @entity33 when asked why he was motivated to take up the cause of the @entity13 : " the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends towards justice			1
" lunch counter protests had become the cause celebre the year before , in 1960 , just two hours up the road in @entity41 , @entity42			1
african - americans , many of them students , sought to break the barrier of segregated lunch counters by sitting in " white - only " sections			1
as the protests spread from @entity41 to other parts of the @entity1 , protesters were arrested and charged			1
civil rights groups had to pay the mounting bails and fines that the protesters were incurring			2
the men of @entity55 wondered whether paying fines and bail -- to the very people who were oppressing them , no less -- was the best course of action			1
rather than pay the $ 100 for their release , the men felt they could make a more profound statement by accepting the full punishment for trespassing : 30 days of hard labor			1
" it showed that this was a moral crusade against injustice , " @entity68 of the @entity69 in @entity70 said			0
" most of the support came from working - class african - americans , so it was very expensive to bail out a lot of protesters			2
so , in a sense , what they did is turn the system on its head			0
so if you are going to incarcerate me , you are going to pay for it , " @entity68 said			0
on the evening of january 30 , 1961 , @entity86 , a student at @entity87 and civil rights organizer , sat down to write a letter to his parents			2
" by the time you read this , i suppose you both will be upset and probably angry , but i hope not			0
i could n't tell you , but this morning i wanted to , but just did n't know how			0
" he and his cohorts had been planning for months			0
they were ready on the morning of january 31 , 1961 , and just after 11 a.m. , they arrived at @entity98 's 5 - 10 - 25 cent @entity97 in downtown @entity0			1
local authorities had caught wind of their plans and awaited their arrival			0
the men stood outside , protesting for a spell before entering			2
the details of exactly what happened inside were disputed in court , but what is known is that 10 men walked in and -- in defiance of the era 's @entity111 -- sat at the counter where people of their skin color were forbidden			1
they were taken to jail , where they sat until their quick trial on trespassing charges			1
" try to understand that what i am doing is right , " @entity86 wrote to his parents before his arrest			0
" it 's not like going to jail for a crime like stealing , killing , etc. , but we 're going for the betterment of all colored people			2
" they spent the night thinking and praying , hoping that what they did next would shock the conscience of a nation			0
@entity134 , a young african - american civil rights attorney from the area , represented the group			2
records of the trial have long since been destroyed , so it 's not clear who said what in the courtroom , but the group was found guilty and offered a choice of paying a $ 100 fine or being sent to a labor camp for 30 days			2
nine of the men chose the labor camp			2
" jailers and the municipalities were receiving these funds to perpetuate the oppression , right ? " @entity68 asked			0
" it was a practical reason behind the ' jail , no bail ' ( movement )			2
" the men were shipped out to the @entity160 to begin their sentences , but according to local news reports , many of the @entity13 were sent to solitary confinement			1
pictures from local newspapers document how the prison farm became a rallying point for protesters			0
it was a shot in the arm for the @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , @entity68 said , because the authorities were saying , " ok , we have to have another strategy to confront this			0
" the group served 28 days at the camp and was released early -- not for good behavior , but because local officials wanted to get them out before the national press arrived			0
on wednesday , the national press will shine a spotlight on the men , in a reminder of the country 's checkered history on civil rights			1
@entity25 is expected to right the wrong of his uncle by clearing the men 's names and vacating their sentences			1
author @entity195 , who wrote a children 's book about the men , " @entity201 , " was integral in getting the @entity13 's case on the court docket			1
she met the still - living members of the @entity13 at a local restaurant in 2011 , and after listening to their story , found herself surprised that she had never heard of them			1
" i was proud to be african - american because i looked at them and thought what a wonderful thing they had done to open the path for me as a children 's author , " she told @entity2			2
" i know i would not be where i am today if folks before me had not forged the way , so i was very honored to be in their presence			0
" after reading a speech from the rev. @entity33 addressing how demonstrators arrested for nonviolent protests were n't disobedient in the broad sense of the word , but rather , " just being disobedient to the immorality of what that law represented , " she began thinking about what she could do to help vindicate the @entity13 , she said			1
she shared her thoughts with @entity31 and asked whether the men could get a pardon , a request @entity31 had field before			2
but he had his reservations			0
" a pardon is an act of forgiveness , and what these guys needed was n't forgiveness because they did n't do anything wrong			0
what these guys needed was justice , and a pardon did n't really speak to the underlying problems with the fact of the conviction in the first place			0
" having their convictions vacated would attack those underlying issues head - on , he felt , and while he 's proud to be able to " play some small part in history " by exonerating the men , do n't call him a hero			1
" the real act of heroism was done by these men 54 years ago , " he said			2
the men of the @entity13 , based on their activities and accomplishments both during and after their 1961 stand , are an impressive bunch			1
