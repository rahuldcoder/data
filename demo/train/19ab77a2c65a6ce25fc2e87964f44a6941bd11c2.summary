-- four suspected @entity2 drone strikes have pounded @entity4 's tribal region since the @entity2 military killed terror leader @entity6 , actions that signal an uptick in the @entity2 fight against @entity11 militants			1
the latest was friday , when four suspected militants died in the @entity14 region of @entity15 , according to two @entity4 intelligence officials , who said an unmanned aircraft fired four missiles at a militant 's vehicle			1
drone strikes have been controversial in @entity4 because of concerns over civilian deaths and disrespect for @entity4 's sovereignty			1
" i do n't think the @entity2 cares about the @entity4 sensibilities , " said @entity26 , a military - affairs analyst			0
" i think it 's game back on			2
" @entity15 is one of the seven districts of @entity4 's volatile tribal region bordering @entity33 , and @entity14 has a strong presence of militants , @entity26 said			1
based on a count by the @entity39 bureau , friday 's suspected drone strike was the 24th so far this year compared to 111 in all of 2010			1
the @entity40 , a website that provides analyses and reporting on war - related matters , said the @entity2 military launched only two strikes in april and seven in march , in both @entity15 and @entity48			1
@entity26 , the managing editor of @entity40 , told @entity0 that there have been drone - strike pauses during spring months in the past , but he said the latest lull came during problems between the @entity2 and @entity4			2
he cited the disagreements over the case of @entity55 , the @entity56 contractor who had been incarcerated and later released after allegedly shooting and killing two @entity4 , and @entity4 rage about a couple of the drone strikes			1
but @entity26 said he believes the dynamics have changed after @entity6 was killed may 2 in a hideout in the @entity4 military garrison town of @entity63			2
he said there 's a lot of @entity2 impatience with the @entity4 and that 's " no big secret after the @entity6 raid			1
" he emphasized that the @entity4 military has n't taken on militants in the @entity14 region , which @entity26 calls a " snake pit " and a " known @entity73 hub			1
" " it 's clear now they are just gon na keep doing it , " he said , referring to the drone strikes			1
the other drone strikes since @entity6 's death occurred last friday , tuesday , and thursday			1
@entity15 is in the same dangerous northwestern @entity4 swath as the district of @entity82 in @entity84 province , where a twin suicide bombing killed at least 80 people on friday			2
the province borders @entity87 , one of the seven district tribal regions where the @entity4 @entity91 members are based			0
the @entity4 @entity91 said it carried out the bombing in retaliation for the killing of terror leader @entity6			2
nearly all of those slain were military recruits who had just completed their training , a government official said			0
about 140 others were injured			0
@entity100 is believed to be a hideout for @entity91 fighters and @entity73 - linked militants fleeing last year 's military operation in the district of @entity48 and ongoing @entity2 drone strikes in @entity15			1
the @entity4 army has carried out numerous ground and air operations in @entity100 but they have n't been able to stamp out the militants			0
last december , around 150 militants ambushed six security checkpoints in @entity100 , killing 11 @entity4 soldiers , officials told @entity0			0
earlier in december , a twin suicide attack targeting a government building in @entity100 killed at least 40 people			0
@entity26 said the @entity4 @entity91 represents a confederation of @entity91 groups in northwestern @entity4 , where they are based			0
they make attacks on @entity4 targets and cross the border into @entity33 for attacks , @entity26 said			0
they are different from the @entity33 @entity91 , focused on re-establishing the @entity126 in @entity33			0
the group is headquartered in @entity128 , @entity4			0
both groups swear allegiance to @entity91 leader , @entity131 , and have close links to @entity73 , @entity26 said			0
journalist @entity133 and @entity0 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			2
