@entity1 , @entity0 -- sometimes , a little inspiration can come from unexpected places			0
in an article on the @entity8 website earlier this month , @entity5 was quoted as saying " the @entity10 model does n't even work for us anymore			1
" then last week , the @entity10 government announced plans for the elimination of about 500,000 state - provided jobs			1
and comments from @entity17 have indicated that that number could rise to a million			0
at the same time , it has said it will encourage foreign investment and privately run firms			0
the new economic policies in @entity10 represent a major turn away from a strict economic ideology and toward a more practical approach			1
but while the @entity28 in @entity10 are becoming more practical in their economic policies , in @entity30 , any discussion of economic policy is becoming more ideologically entrenched			1
the @entity35 wing of the @entity36 , fresh off primary wins in @entity32 and @entity33 , are adamant in their call for lower taxes and reduction , or elimination , of government regulation			0
they want to roll back the @entity45 administration 's health care reform and financial market reforms			2
on the @entity49 side , we have the @entity45 administration 's economic advisers who , for the most part , seem bent on increasing spending at any cost			0
this die - hard @entity57 approach would have @entity58 turning in his grave			0
maybe it is time for us to admit , like @entity10 , that there are parts of our economic system that do not work			1
the @entity64 surely should be a wake - up call			0
we must address some of the fundamental misalignment of incentives that exist in our economy			2
one of them is the economic role the housing industry plays			0
while public policy that encouraged home building may have made sense during the last century , particularly when @entity71 needed more new houses to accommodate the post-war baby boom , does it still make sense today ? today , the @entity71 family is shrinking , and yet many continue trading up , and new houses are getting larger and larger			1
vast amounts of this country 's financial resources still go to the housing market			2
we should ask : are there better uses for these resources ? chief among the subsidies the housing industry receives is the income tax deduction for home mortgage interest			1
according to the @entity94 , this is estimated to cost the @entity95 $ 131 billion in 2012			0
by eliminating or scaling back the deduction , not only would the government generate more tax revenue , but it would also remove an important distortion in our financial markets			1
in addition , we need to address the problems these housing industry subsidies have caused			0
we can do this by establishing special temporary bankruptcy courts that have the legal power to force write - downs on delinquent mortgages			0
here in @entity0 , we had temporary bankruptcy courts in the 1980s to deal with all of bankruptcies resulting from the oil bust			0
we should do the same thing in states now hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis			2
in these temporary courts , those who speculated on the mortgage market should be financially punished , while those who were duped should have their mortgages restructured			2
this would greatly increase the flow of money through the mortgage market and help revitalize our financial markets			1
second , we must address the issue that our financial markets are not doing a very efficient job in allocating capital			2
entrepreneurs and small businesses find it difficult to get the capital they need to start and expand their businesses			1
this is because of misaligned incentives : banks can borrow money from the @entity137 at an interest rate of essentially zero and use those funds to buy and sell stocks , bonds and currencies for a profit			2
under this setup , why would banks go to all the trouble of lending money to a small business ? it is much easier and profitable for the banks to simply trade financial securities			1
and that is what they have been doing -- making huge profits without lending to small businesses			1
instead of limiting banks ' ability to trade securities for their own profits , something former @entity137 chair @entity159 has suggested , @entity30 seems interested only in protecting the big banks ' profitability			2
this is not to say we can let the financial system collapse			0
we need a functioning banking system to make sure workers ' paychecks do n't bounce			0
but if , as the big banks claim , they can not provide basic banking services at a high enough profit level , and thus need to sell complex and risky financial products such as derivatives , then nonprofits should be afforded a larger share of the market			1
perhaps credit unions should be allowed to grow in size and in the types of financial products they offer			0
in addition , to pay for additional regulation , we should work with the @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 to establish a worldwide sales tax on financial transactions -- the often discussed modern version of a @entity189 tax , named after the late nobel laureate @entity189			1
a @entity189 tax may reduce the amount of financial transactions and even cost jobs in the financial markets			1
however , as @entity195 of @entity196 has shown , there has been an excessive increase in the amount of resources our financial markets consume			0
a @entity189 tax could reduce this distortion			0
making structural changes to our economy will not be easy and , yes , some of them require some people to pay more taxes			0
but we , like the @entity10 , need to realize that parts of our economy are simply not working			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 says @entity10 is *re-evaluating* economy , maybe @entity71 should look inward , too
parties should not dig into ideologies , he says ; instead fix parts of economy not working
get *rid* of costly mortgage tax deduction , he says ; get banks to start lending to businesses
@entity214 : try a worldwide sales tax on financial deals ; @entity71 must change structure of economy
