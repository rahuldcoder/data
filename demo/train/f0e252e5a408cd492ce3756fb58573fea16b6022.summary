@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i tell people outside @entity1 that i live in @entity0 , i 'm almost always asked the now inevitable question : " do you feel safe there ? " or worse , " what 's with the rape culture in @entity1 ? " the december 16 , 2012 gang rape of a student inside a moving bus has sadly become @entity1 's defining story of the past year			1
@entity14 : do you think anything has changed ? tell us the horrific details so ingrained in people 's memories , @entity1 cities are now perceived by many around the world as " rape capitals			1
" however , for anyone who knows @entity1 and lives here , these sweeping generalizations are simplistic and unjustified			1
the definition of what constitutes rape varies from country to country so there 's no internationally accepted method of comparing @entity1 's rape statistics with those of other nations			1
@entity0 rape exposes perils of being a woman in @entity1 but in a country of 1.2 billion people , where local sexual assault cases which would n't merit a mention in the @entity46 or @entity47 now make headlines , you can be excused for thinking @entity1 is suffering from a " rape epidemic			1
" even @entity1 women 's rights activists will agree , rape is not part of the country 's culture ; it 's certainly not a new phenomenon and it 's surely not particular to @entity1			1
heightened awareness what is new to this country though , and what is significant , is the heightened awareness of sexual violence against women			2
the discourse has dominated local newspaper editorials and television talk shows this year			2
women are now feeling more emboldened to ignore the stigma and report not just cases of rape , but even harassment , molestation , stalking and voyeurism			1
opinion : where have @entity1 's females gone ? it is this change that makes the december @entity0 gang rape a turning point for @entity1 and perhaps the victim 's lasting legacy			1
@entity1 law prohibits the naming of sexual assault victims , but to her family and millions of @entity1 , she will be remembered by the name the media gave her : @entity88 , or " fearless one			1
" on december 17 , 2012 , the day after the attack , i received a text message from students at @entity0 's prestigious @entity93 , informing the media of a protest being held at the location where the 23 - year - old medical student and her male friend had boarded a bus the previous night			1
the white chartered bus that circled the city for almost an hour while the student was repeatedly raped by six men and sexually violated with an iron rod			1
i was n't expecting a large showing , after all , sexual assault is sadly commonplace			2
government statistics show a woman is raped every 20 minutes in @entity1			1
' @entity109 ' but when i arrived at the intersection in the upscale @entity112 neighborhood , i saw hundreds of young urban students holding hands , hoisting placards , shouting slogans			0
your views : one year on , has anything changed for @entity1 's women ? send us your experiences			1
i remember reporting how unusual it is for this section of society to protest in @entity0 ; they tend to be politically apathetic because they are the materially contented , having benefited more than others from @entity1 's economic growth over the last two decades			1
but one after another , young women and men took to the streets shouting , " enough is enough			2
" " i 'm protesting today because this ( rape ) is an everyday problem , " explained one student			1
" i ca n't wear what i want , i ca n't go where i want without men staring at me ... where is my freedom ? " asked another			0
what happened next was unprecedented			0
day by day , the protests swelled from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands ; young and old , men and women marching to @entity1 's seat of power , jumping over barricades , braving the water cannons in @entity0 's december cold			1
no one expected it to become so big			0
some even called it the " @entity109			0
" the government was shaken to its core			0
" sometimes it just takes one incident to galvanize a society and to inspire change , and this certainly seems to be that watershed moment , " i said during a live shot			1
relating to victim what was it about this particular incident that struck a nerve ? the horrific nature of the act was one thing , but would people have reacted in the same way if this had happened in rural @entity1 ? probably not			1
as one student put it , " we 're protesting here because she ( the victim ) could have been me			2
" many in @entity0 could relate to the victim			0
she represented the aspirations of so many @entity1 girls , studying hard , daring to dream big			1
the victim 's family migrated to @entity0 from a village in @entity187 state in search of a better life			0
her father worked 16 - hour shifts as a baggage handler at the @entity0 airport to pay for her education			2
she even tutored several neighborhood children to help put her two younger brothers through school			0
" she had a great passion for academics			0
every year the happiest day for us was when my daughter 's school results would come out , she would always be one of the top two students in class , " her father @entity200 remembered proudly			0
she wanted to become a doctor and lift her family 's status in society , a culture that places high value on social class			2
in some ways she succeeded			0
she managed to attend some of the country 's best schools , get a job at an international call center , inspire her brothers to study engineering and aeronautics			0
on that fateful night , she was watching @entity231 's " @entity230 " at an upscale mall , where young girls in skinny jeans and tank tops hang out at @entity226 , shop at @entity228 and eat sushi			0
fighting for women one year on , i reflect on what 's changed			2
i have met some incredibly strong women fighting against all odds in a society which often places less value on women			1
meet @entity1 's @entity240 : the teens fighting back @entity242 , 25 , was pressured to abort all four of her babies simply because they were girls			2
" how could they afford to pay for their daughter 's dowry ? " her husband asked			0
daughters , especially in rural @entity1 , are often seen as a burden			2
a 16 - year - old student from a lower caste ( known as a dalit ) was gang raped by eight upper class men in the state of @entity257			1
when her father found out what his daughter had been through , he killed himself out of shame			0
relatives and neighbors advised the family not to report the case to the police because no one would want to marry a " tainted " girl			0
@entity270 blamed in @entity1 's rape culture i also met a mother who has been tirelessly fighting for justice the past six years			1
her daughter was gang raped by wealthier neighborhood boys when she was just a teenager			2
this remarkable woman has hired more than a dozen lawyers , some female , but they all kept switching sides or said they could no longer represent her			0
the mother suspects they were bought over by the wealthier rapists			0
a teen 's rape has far - reaching effects @entity1 's awakening under enormous public pressure , the government ordered the december @entity0 gang rape case to be fast - tracked			1
but what about the tens of thousands of other rape cases left languishing in @entity1 's notoriously slow - moving judicial system ? all of these women though , no matter what corner of @entity1 they come from , have heard about the @entity0 gang rape and the justice the victim eventually got			1
they say they too have a sense of hope now			0
in the headlines this month , the managing editor of one of @entity1 's most respected investigative magazines resigned in disgrace after he allegedly assaulted a young female colleague			2
he acknowledged a " lapse of judgment " but insisted it was not assault			0
in another case , an intern accusing a @entity316 judge of sexual harassment			0
stories which would have likely gone unnoticed , unreported a year ago			0
something has shifted in @entity1 this year			2
@entity88 's parents take solace in this			0
they told me they have lost everything , their lives will never be the same but they are proud of the change their daughter helped bring about			0
" let us not forget , it was because of her sacrifice that all these changes have taken place and i believe there will be more positive changes in the future , " her father told me , underlining the societal changes emerging out of a personal disaster			0
keeping chivalry alive in @entity1 : men respond to rape crisis			1
