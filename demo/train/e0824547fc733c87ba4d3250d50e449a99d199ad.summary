@entity0 -- president @entity2 is calling for the immediate release of three @entity5 hikers seized by @entity7 forces along the @entity9 border who will have been in custody for exactly a year on saturday			1
" their unjust detention has nothing to do with the issues that continue to divide the @entity5 and the international community from the @entity7 government , " @entity2 said in a statement friday			1
" this is a humanitarian imperative , as these three young people are innocent of any crime			1
" the three @entity5 -- @entity22 , @entity22 , and @entity22 -- were detained after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border while hiking in @entity9 's @entity24			2
the @entity25 reported last month that two witnesses have said they saw members of @entity7 's national police force cross into @entity9 to apprehend the three			2
@entity30 has claimed the three hikers are spies			0
@entity7 's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of @entity7 prisoners , according to state media			1
" i want to be perfectly clear : @entity22 , @entity22 and @entity22 have never worked for the @entity5 government , " @entity2 said			1
" they are simply open - minded and adventurous young people who represent the best of @entity5 , and of the human spirit			2
they are teachers , artists , and advocates for social and environmental justice			0
they have never had any quarrel with the government of @entity7 , and have great respect for the @entity7 people			2
" the president said he spoke with the hikers ' mothers this week and noted that the @entity7 government allowed the women to visit their children earlier this year			1
but " i can not imagine how painful it was for these three courageous women to return home without their children			0
i told these three mothers that @entity22 , @entity22 and @entity22 are in my thoughts and prayers , and that the @entity5 government would continue to do all that it could to secure their release			1
" meanwhile , the mothers continue to grow increasingly angry and exasperated as they press the @entity7 government to free their children			2
" this is unbelievable to us at this point , " @entity65 told @entity1 's @entity66 earlier friday			0
" i mean , it is outrageous that they are still there			0
" @entity22 , the mother of hiker @entity22 , said at first they thought the ordeal would be " over fairly quickly			0
" she said it has gone on " long enough			0
" @entity2 also recently spoke with the wife of @entity76 , a former @entity77 agent who went missing in @entity7 over three years ago			1
" we continue to have no information about his welfare , and reiterate our call for the government of @entity7 to provide any information that it has about his whereabouts , " the president said			0
" it is time to facilitate @entity76 's return to the family and friends who have suffered so greatly in his absence			0
