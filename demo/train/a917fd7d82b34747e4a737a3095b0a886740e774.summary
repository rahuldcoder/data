-- the search for debris that could belong to missing @entity3 evokes different emotions for relatives of the passengers			1
some just want closure ; others might have their hopes of seeing their loved ones alive dashed			0
the objects , seen in satellite images taken sunday , have not been confirmed to be parts of the missing plane			2
the first search plane to fly over the area found no sign of debris			1
still , @entity20 's interim transportation secretary called it a " credible lead			0
" so the hopes and fears of the passengers ' families are once again floating to the surface as they await a definitive answer on the newest clue			2
" it strikes me as just one more lead that may or may not come true , " said @entity29 , the partner of @entity31 passenger @entity30			2
" so it 's enough to make us all anxious again after a couple of days of quiet , but you know , i 'm cautiously pessimistic that it 's not a piece of the plane			2
" @entity29 's intuition is that the passengers are alive , the victims of a hijacking plot in which their return remains a possibility			2
" so if this debris is indeed part of that plane , then it kind of dashes that wishful thinking to pieces , " she told @entity0 's @entity54			1
" so i really hope it 's not a part of the plane , but , you know , if it is , then at least we can go down another path of deciding that maybe we need to start preparing for another scenario instead			1
" officials from @entity66 met with passengers ' families in @entity69 behind closed doors for about two hours thursday			2
they were shown the satellite images that were used to pinpoint the debris but also told that there is no confirmation that it is the plane			1
the families , for now , were reserving judgment on what the new development may bring			0
many who entered the meeting were stoic , doing their best to stay composed in stressful times			0
relatives waiting at a @entity84 hotel watched on tv as @entity87 prime minister @entity86 briefed the @entity87 @entity88 on the " new and credible " information about the two objects in the southern @entity91 that could be from the plane			1
the families ' mood was tense as they watched @entity86 report the new findings			0
a heavy sigh punctuated the attentive atmosphere , giving voice to their frustrations			0
as they listened to a @entity102 translation of the news conference , the relatives hung on every word , sitting up straight or edging forward			1
psychologists attending to the relatives in @entity84 are worried that when definitive news comes out , it could be overwhelming for the families			1
some of the elderly have reported suicidal thoughts because their only children -- products of @entity102 's one - child policy -- were on flight 370			0
it could be just as hard on the families if the debris turns out to be a false lead			2
" i firmly that believe my son , together with everyone on board , will all survive , " said @entity120 , a missing passenger 's father			1
" this is the first time in my life to experience something like this , " he said			0
" in the past i just watched other peoples ' stories on the news			2
i watched explosions , ships sink and plane accidents			2
those were other peoples ' stories			0
this time , it is my turn for bad luck			0
it is my turn to actually experience this			0
this is not watching news ; it is living it			1
" at the hotel in @entity84 where the briefings are held , a message board was put on a wall and , within a few hours , was overflowing with notes			0
" dear dad , i miss your face , i miss holding your hand , i miss hearing your teachings and your wisdom , " one message said			0
@entity20 acting transportation minister @entity161 said he understands that the news about the debris will be foremost on the families ' minds			1
" we do care about them , and we understand what they are going through , " he said			0
" for the families around the world , the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just do n't have : the location of @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity29 disagreed that the relatives are a priority for the officials			0
" i do n't necessarily think the people investigating the situation are particularly caring about what the families feel like			0
they 're caring about finding the plane , and that 's probably as it should be , " she said			0
in @entity69 , where @entity3 originated , families had the same mixed feelings as those in @entity84 and elsewhere			1
@entity192 , the father of one of the passengers , said he hopes those on board are still alive but is ready to acknowledge that the plane may have met another fate			1
" my feeling is , personally , i am grateful to the @entity87 government for finding it , " he said			1
" both governments , @entity87 and @entity20			1
if it 's true , i will accept that			0
" @entity66 said it wo n't be sending representatives or family members to @entity87 unless the objects are confirmed as plane debris			1
