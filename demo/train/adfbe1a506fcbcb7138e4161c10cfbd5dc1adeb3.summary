-- which state has given us @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 ? @entity9 has			1
which state has given us pro football 's @entity11 and @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 ? @entity9 has			1
and which state has given us countless thrills , championships galore and some of the most famous teams in the history of @entity22 sport ? @entity9 has n't			1
but that is about to change			0
in fact , it probably already has changed			0
if you check out college football 's latest national rankings , the no. 1 team in the entire @entity22 is , to the shock of many , @entity31			1
close on its heels at no. 3 is , almost as unexpectedly , the @entity35 , better known to y'all as " @entity37 " @entity9 are burning with football fever			1
a state without a franchise in pro basketball , baseball , football and hockey , a second fiddler to the @entity47 bands of @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 in college football for quite a while , @entity9 is making up for lost time in 2014			1
ok , not everybody from the @entity9 is overjoyed about this -- there must be at least 10 or 20 folks down there who do n't give a hoot			1
otherwise , the campus towns of @entity61 and @entity62 are experiencing a rare kind of double - your - pleasure euphoria , and alumni ( or just plain old football followers ) from @entity67 to @entity68 are busting with pride over @entity22 's hottest teams			1
is this temporary ? a midseason night 's dream ? could be			0
the season 's only half done , after all			0
and @entity31 's @entity74 still have strong opponents on the schedule , like those always dangerous @entity77			2
@entity9 's rebels , meanwhile , must still get past opponents like the @entity80 and upset - minded opponents like the @entity82			2
and to top it all ? somebody 's going to emerge victorious in what very well might become the most talked about battle in this state since the 1863 ( at @entity90 , for those of you wondering ) -- hang onto your helmets for @entity31 vs. @entity37 on november 29			1
if you 've been missing how this @entity9 madness came to pass , let us catch you up : @entity31 , unranked , unnoticed by a whole mess of @entity97 and @entity98 in spite of bowl - game victories in 2010 , 2011 and 2013 , began this season by defeating @entity102 49 - 10 , @entity103 47 - 34 , @entity104 35 - 3 , @entity105 34 - 29 , @entity106 48 - 31 and , this past weekend , @entity80 38 - 23			1
as a result , coach @entity108 's squad has made an unprecedented rise in the @entity113 poll 's rankings -- and is believed to be college football 's first team to go from unranked to no. 1 in just six weeks			1
@entity31 received 45 first - place votes to leapfrog @entity118 , which got just 12			2
@entity37 , meanwhile , claimed three first - place votes for itself and is ranked no. 3			2
so far , coach @entity121 's guys have knocked off @entity122 35 - 13 , @entity123 41 - 3 , @entity124 56 - 15 , @entity125 24 - 3 , @entity48 23 - 17 and , this past weekend , @entity106 35 - 20			0
it 's proof positive that , to quote former @entity77 running back @entity129 , life really is a box of chocolates -- you really do n't know what you 're going to get			0
in the grand old @entity137 town of @entity61 , population 23,888 , the teams of @entity31 are loyally supported and loved			1
but the football team there has barely been a blip on the national radar since a 1940 one went 10 - 0 - 1			2
for as long as football has been there , the @entity74 have lost more games than they have won			0
in the charming , brainy community of @entity62 , population 20,865 , the teams of @entity37 are followed and revered			1
but not since the glory years of 1959 , 1960 and 1962 -- three straight @entity151 triumphs -- have the @entity149 truly generated a nationwide gridiron sizzle			0
the name of @entity31 's quarterback , @entity156 , did not roll off many tongues in @entity159 preliminary discussions			2
now , almost no one out there in @entity162 is asking " who 's @entity156 ? " after all , @entity156 's impressive play , along with the rushing of @entity165 and receiving of @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 , took this school from @entity170 of ' @entity172 status to the exalted team people are talking about			0
@entity37 has a fine qb of its own , @entity174 , with a running game led by @entity176 and the memorably named @entity177			2
if anyone expected a letdown when big , bad ' @entity180 came to town , a hard - earned 23 - 17 win over the @entity77 resulted in the @entity149 ' faithful storming the field and ripping down the goal posts			0
that impromptu act of celebration cost the school $ 50,000 in a fine from the @entity190 , one that seemed well worth paying to many of those fans			0
hey , why not ? mississippians must get tired of the constant attention given a @entity195 or @entity196 or @entity197 or some other event from the wide world of sports , never having a horse in those races			0
it 's nice to be in play			0
college football is cool , and hundreds of thousands there are true to his or her school			1
again , the season 's only half - done			0
but most of @entity9 wo n't miss a minute of the next half			2
join us on @entity215 / @entity214 .			0
