-- think 1960s @entity1 and images of hippies , @entity5 protests , the civil rights movement , sexual revolution and drug experimentation will mostly likely spring to mind			1
" @entity15 , " @entity9 famously sung as counterculture ideas gripped the west 's imagination -- much to the horror of the establishment			1
@entity16 was no different , with one of the decade 's most iconic images that of @entity23 sprinters @entity20 and @entity21 making their gloved @entity24 salutes at the @entity25 , catapulting the issue of @entity23 segregation to a worldwide audience			0
it was no easy ride for @entity23 female sporting pioneers in the 1960s either			1
jockey @entity32 faced such vitriol at her first race that the 18 - year - old required a full police escort			1
the first professional female jockey in the @entity23 still remembers the mayhem that surrounded her as she took to the @entity39 in @entity40 in 1969			1
the petite teenager with curly brown locks was forced to fight her way through the flashing cameras and jeering crowd to a small office -- the only available space for a female to change			1
" the crowd was just swarming all over me			2
they were crazy , up in arms , " @entity32 told @entity0			1
" the hecklers were yelling : ' go back to the kitchen and cook dinner			2
' that was the mentality at the time			2
" they thought i was going to be the downfall of the whole sport , which is such a medieval thought			2
i was like : ' come on people , this is the 1960s ! ' " today there are several dozen female jockeys racing professionally in @entity1 , compared with the hundreds of male jockeys who still dominate the sport			1
women are making progress -- albeit it slowly -- with @entity67 becoming the first female jockey to compete in the world 's richest horse race , the $ 10million @entity66 , earlier this year			1
speaking from her home in @entity72 , @entity73 , feisty 63 - year - old @entity32 explained half the battle , as she fought to ride professionally , was simply getting male jockeys to compete against her			1
in 1968 two female riders had been forced to drop out of their races after the male jockeys boycotted the race , even going to the extent of throwing stones at the women 's changing room trailers			0
" people were saying we were n't strong enough or smart enough to ride in a pari - mutuel ( professional gambling ) race , " @entity32 said			1
" they thought it would be dangerous for other people to ride against us because we would n't know what to do under pressure			0
" it was only when officials threatened to fine or suspend refusenik male jockeys that @entity32 finally got her chance to compete			1
the smiley teen dressed in pink silks happily proved the naysayers wrong , riding horse @entity98 to a respectable ninth place in a 12 - strong field			0
" when i finally got on the horse it was perfect because everyone just cares about the race , " @entity32 said			2
" everyone cheered me when i came back			0
sure , i had a handful of hecklers , but for the most part i never encountered too much trouble from the crowd after that			0
" as @entity32 explains , women simply were n't a part of the horse racing world in the 1960s			1
" a woman 's place was in the kitchen or caring for the children , " she said			0
" the women 's rights movement was happening , but to be honest all i cared about was horses			0
i just wanted to ride			0
i marched to the beat of my own drum			0
" yes , i 'm a feminist			0
but i 've always seen myself as more of an equal rights activist			0
" just two weeks after her debut , @entity32 returned to the track to win her first professional race			1
in a career spanning three decades , she rode 300 winners , and became the first woman to compete in the prestigious @entity132 in 1970 -- a race that only six women have taken part in since it was first run in 1875			1
@entity32 , who grew up in @entity136 , @entity40 , says no one in her family " had ever even heard of a horse , " let alone the @entity132 , until she began riding at a nearby ranch as a 13 - year - old			1
but even younger brother @entity142 , who was serving in @entity5 at the time , was glued to his radio for that historic @entity132 race			1
bunkered down in his barracks with around 100 other soldiers , @entity142 cheered on as his sister rode horse @entity149 in one of the country 's most famous derbys , finishing 15th in a field of 17			0
now a grandmother - of - two , @entity32 still receives hundreds of letters from children every year asking her how it felt to make history that day			2
" it was great for me as a rider , as a female and as a person , " @entity32 said			1
" for someone to think i was capable of riding in the @entity132 was a huge step forward			2
" @entity32 's racing career took her to competitions across the world , with her popularity skyrocketing -- in of all places -- in @entity171			1
she recalls a race in the early 1970s which saw her and a @entity174 jockey whipping each other in a fierce battle on the field			0
while leading the pack , @entity32 realized the jockey just behind was holding on to her saddle , giving his horse a free ride			1
in the days before cctv cameras , @entity32 did what any jockey would do and get away with -- she got out her stick and whacked him			1
the pair spent the remainder of the race hitting each other until finally he pulled away in the last leg and won			0
" when he came off the track , the women in the crowd blasted him with tomatoes , eggs , anything they could find , " @entity32 said			2
" they were booing their own country 's jockey , threatening bodily harm to him after the race , while i was greeted by cheering , enthusiastic women			0
" after marrying and the birth of her two daughters , @entity32 juggled her racing career and family life until a horrific accident in 1992 left her virtually bed - bound for months			1
" the horse i was riding fell backwards and i broke my leg in six or seven places			0
the doctors said i would never ride again , " @entity32 said			2
" but despite the fact i looked like some sort of bionic woman with braces on my legs , i eventually started training again			0
" she finally retired in 1999 , setting up her own equine sales business			0
@entity32 remains pragmatic about her contribution to the industry -- arguing that while things are still not quite equal for female jockeys , they have come a long way since 1969			1
" when i was 16 and first got my exercise rider 's license there was not one other female stable hand			2
but by the 1990s around half were women , " @entity32 said			2
" somebody had to open the door			0
it was n't all down to me but i think i was a big part of that			0
" she added : " the mentality in the 1960s was that women were n't smart or strong enough to be jockeys			0
but i proved that a woman could do the job			0
" i like to think i was a little footprint on the path to equality			0

1960s @entity1 was a time of shaking up the establishment -- and sport was no *exception*
@entity32 caused controversy as the first professional female jockey
needed a police escort onto @entity255 amid swarming hecklers
