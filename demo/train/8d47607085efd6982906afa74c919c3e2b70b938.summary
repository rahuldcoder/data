@entity0 , @entity1 -- more than 13 years after his parents drowned in a flash flood , @entity3 is at the @entity6 , building a bridge that might have prevented their deaths			1
the hanging footbridge will provide safe passage over the @entity11 , a frequently flooded waterway in @entity0 , @entity1			2
" before the bridge , there [ were ] so many people , so many who lost their lives , " said @entity3 , 32			1
" i know , because i have no parents			0
i have no parents , because this river took them			0
" @entity3 is working alongside other local residents and @entity22 , a master mason who has been building bridges through @entity1 's mountainous terrain since 1997			1
@entity22 , a @entity26 , @entity25 , native who came to @entity1 in 1989 , has seen firsthand how flash floods -- and the threat of predators such as crocodiles and hippos -- can make rivers impassable in isolated communities			1
" i 've worked all over @entity1 , " said @entity22 , 54			1
" and every community [ has ] a story of ... loved ones lost			0
" when @entity22 arrived in @entity1 as a young missionary , he befriended @entity38 , a fellow development worker who introduced him to a bridge build in 1996			1
the experience changed the course of his life			0
" it was a plea from the community , " @entity22 recalled			2
" i saw that building a bridge could change lives and transform communities			2
" @entity22 has been building bridges ever since , and in 2003 he founded the nonprofit organization @entity50			1
the organization oversees the building of bridges that not only save lives but connect isolated villagers to resources that can improve their way of life			1
" when it floods , people really suffer not being able to get to the clinic or the market or to their school , " @entity22 said			1
" like every people , they have dreams			2
" since 1997 , @entity22 has helped build 45 bridges in @entity1			1
he estimates they 've affected tens of thousands of lives , but he insists his work is not about the numbers			2
" i have built many bridges in very remote areas for the ' few and the needy ' that a larger organization may not consider , " he said			2
" knowing this bridge will probably save at least one life is what makes me tick			2
... i build bridges because i want to save lives , lives that i will never know about			1
" @entity22 's hanging footbridges are simple in design , with an average length of 120 feet and an average cost of about $ 6,000			1
they are built using basic materials and local tools so villagers can maintain them and make repairs when needed			0
there is high demand for @entity22 's help			1
but because of limited financing , he is able to organize only five or six projects a year			1
to determine which projects he takes on , @entity22 visits the village that initiated the request			1
to qualify for a bridge , the river in question must be considered a peril to cross			2
it also has to inhibit access to education , health care or commerce			1
@entity22 also requires that the community demonstrate a willingness and ability to participate in the construction of the bridge , whether it 's by gathering sand , making gravel or digging foundations			1
it 's " so they can take pride in their bridge , so that they feel they played a big role in it and that they have ownership , " @entity22 said			1
@entity3 has no problem with making that commitment			0
" it is good for us , because this is our bridge , " he said			0
" it is not for the men who gave it to us			0
so people should guard and watch over it like it is their own			0
" although the bridges are sponsored by donors , villagers are also expected to provide some form of financial contribution			0
" i do n't know how many goats i have in this region			0
but they always give me a goat , " @entity22 said			2
" i was even offered a young wife in a real rural area			0
and i had to refuse that			0
" @entity22 's work requires that he spend weeks , even months at a time away from his wife and home in @entity155			1
and over the past 15 years , he 's been robbed at gunpoint , plagued by parasites and afflicted with grave illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever			0
but he does n't see his role as sacrificial			0
" i feel i 'm blessed ... privileged to do what i 'm doing , " he said			0
" a bridge is a beautiful metaphor for many things			0
there are bridges of hope , bridges of peace , bridges of life			0
to me , bridges are beautiful			0
" want to get involved ? check out the bridging the @entity176 website at @entity177 and see how to help .			0
