-- the one question we all desperately want answered may have gone to the grave with @entity4 : why ? why did he park at the @entity6 on monday , walk into @entity7 , perch himself on an overlook above the atrium and open fire ? the bullets that rained down killed 12 people and wounded eight others			1
why ? but that 's not the only missing puzzle piece			0
investigators are painstakingly trying to piece together the motive , the means and the method			0
" no piece of information is too small , " says @entity20 of the @entity21			0
" we are looking to learn everything we can about his recent movements , his contacts and associates			0
" for now , here 's what we know and what we do n't know			2
what is security like at the @entity6 ? the motive what we know : senate majority leader @entity37 may have said it best tuesday when he told colleagues that " there is no explanation for the violence			1
" so far , investigators have n't offered any clue as to what motivated @entity4 to kill			1
friends say he had been frustrated over pay and benefits issues from a previous contracting job , and federal law enforcement sources said he may have contacted @entity52 hospitals for possible treatment of psychological issues			2
but so far , investigators have n't said if either of those issues contributed to the attack			1
what we do n't know : what he might have left behind in his @entity62 hotel room , either in writing or on any computers @entity21 agents may have found while searching the room			1
terrorism has n't been ruled out but seems unlikely , according to @entity62 mayor @entity68			1
the shooter what we know : throughout the day , authorities said they were looking for a second man			0
but by nightfall , they said they were " confident " that @entity4 was the lone gunman			2
" we have exhausted all means to eliminate that possible last suspect , " said @entity77 chief @entity76			0
" so we do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person responsible for the loss of life inside of the base			0
" on tuesday , @entity20 , the assistant director in charge of the @entity21 's @entity62 field office , underscored that , telling reporters it 's believed that @entity4 acted alone			1
what we do n't know : while authorities have stated they do n't think anyone else besides @entity4 opened fire at the @entity6 , that does n't mean others did n't help him or know about the plot			1
@entity4 arrived in @entity62 on or around august 25 , staying in hotels in the capital ever since , said @entity20			1
@entity99 , a former executive assistant director of the @entity21 , said he believed authorities will be talking to people @entity4 has known for years -- including those he went to school with and served in the @entity6 with -- as well as looking at things like bank and cell phone records			1
the victims what we know : we now have all the names of 12 victims			0
they range in age from 46 to 73			0
another eight people are recovering from wounds inflicted in the shooting , including three at @entity116			0
@entity62 mayor @entity68 said many of the victims gunned down in the @entity6 's @entity7 were eating breakfast when @entity4 shot at them from above			1
what we do n't know : we have yet to find out more about many of the victims , such as what they did at the @entity6 , where they were at the time of the shooting , etc. victims from @entity6 shooting identified @entity128 what we know : @entity62 police chief @entity76 said tuesday that @entity4 had " multiple contacts " with officers from several agencies during the shooting spree			1
the ordeal ended when @entity62 police officer @entity136 fatally shot @entity4 , 34 , mayor @entity68 told @entity0			1
what we do n't know : exactly how @entity4 died , beyond the fact it happened after 30 minutes of gunfire , according to @entity68			1
his history what we know : he left @entity143 after apparently helping rescue efforts at the site of the @entity146 after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , according according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation			0
his father told @entity153 police after a 2004 arrest that @entity4 was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder related to that experience			1
he had served in the @entity6 , but officials moved to discharge him in 2010 over a pattern of misconduct that included insubordination , unauthorized absences and other infractions , according to a @entity164 defense official			2
it was n't enough for a general discharge , so @entity6 officials decided to grant him an honorable discharge , the official said			1
as a contractor , he worked in information technology , had medium security clearance , high enough to work at multiple @entity6 offices over the summer			1
he had an @entity175 badge to enter the @entity6			2
his employer says the shooter jumped through all the right hoops			0
" @entity4 had a security clearance that was updated in july , approved by military security service personnel , " said @entity179 , ceo at the experts			1
" there is nothing that came up in all the searches			0
" he appeared to become increasingly troubled in recent years , according to the source with direct knowledge of the investigation			0
he was hearing voices and having problems sleeping , the source said			0
he was growing increasingly troubled and in recent months had exhibited signs of mental problems , according to the source			0
based on family accounts , it appears @entity4 " basically snapped , " the source said			2
on august 7 , police in @entity197 , @entity198 , investigating a harassment complaint at a @entity200 encountered @entity4			1
he told them that an individual " had sent three people to follow him and to talk , keep him awake and send vibrations into his body , " according to a police report			0
these individuals , @entity4 police , had followed him to three hotels in the area -- including talking to him through walls and the floor and using " some sort of machine " to send vibrations through the ceiling that prevented him from falling asleep			1
police subsequently notified officials at a @entity6 base in @entity197 , the police report stated			1
officials at @entity197 referred @entity0 to the @entity21 on tuesday when asked about the incident , and the @entity21 subsequently had no comment on the august police report			0
what we do n't know : how he was able to get a security clearance with such a spotty background			1
former @entity6 seal @entity229 says a poor or incomplete background check is to blame			2
" most people , when they get into that , they are given an interim clearance , and that means that the background check has n't been done but it 's in the process of being done , " @entity229 said			2
" he may have started out with an interim clearance and a background check should have been done			0
" the former @entity230 says just running @entity4 ' fingerprints would have turned up his arrest record			2
in @entity153 , he fired several shots into the tires of a car during an altercation over construction near where he lived in 2004			0
there was also a weapons incident in @entity251 in 2010			0
who was accused @entity6 gunman @entity4 ? security at the yard what we know : @entity4 drove onto the grounds of @entity6 on monday morning with a shotgun , according to federal law enforcement sources with detailed knowledge of the investigation			1
he proceeded into @entity7 and opened fire			0
he had access to the @entity6 because of his contracting work , and he used a valid pass to gain entry			2
city police were the first law enforcement personnel on site within eight minutes of when the first shots rang out , according to @entity68 , and they were joined soon by @entity271 members			0
@entity62 police chief @entity76 said there 's " no doubt in mind " that law enforcement officers response to the shooting " saved numerous lives			1
" what we do n't know : even to drive or walk onto the base , a person would be required to present credentials , said @entity6 capt. @entity283			2
building 197 has armed security at the door			0
how did he get the guns past them ? did cost - cutting compromise @entity6 security ? rep. @entity291 , an @entity293 @entity292 and a member of the @entity295 , thinks so			1
he wants a congressional briefing from the @entity298 inspector general on a @entity6 security audit that he says was released after monday 's shooting			1
" it is my understanding that the @entity304 report indicates the @entity6 may have implemented an unproven system in order to cut costs , " @entity291 said			2
" i also learned that potentially numerous felons may have been able to gain restricted access to several military installations across the country due to insufficient background checks , increasing the risk to our military personnel and civilian employees			0
" audit reports @entity6 risked security to cut costs , says source his weapons what we know : federal law enforcement sources say authorities have recovered three weapons from the scene of the mass shooting , including one -- a shotgun -- that investigators believe he brought in to the compound			1
the other two weapons -- handguns -- the sources say , may have been taken from guards			0
what we do n't know : the sources , who have detailed knowledge of the investigation , cautioned that initial investigation information that an ar - 15 rifle was used may have been incorrect			2
it is believed that @entity4 had rented an @entity344 , but returned it before monday morning 's shootings			2
on sunday , @entity4 purchased a @entity347 shotgun and a small amount of ammunition at @entity350 in northern @entity351 , the store 's attorney , @entity354 , said			1
@entity4 spent " a couple hours " there , including at its practice range , the lawyer added			2
in according with federal law , @entity4 name and other applicable information was provided to the @entity362 and he was approved to purchase the gun , according to @entity354			2
@entity4 had the proper credentials to get into the @entity6 , said @entity62 's mayor			1
but @entity68 added that it was unclear how he got the shotgun past security			1
@entity20 , from the @entity21 , said tuesday that @entity4 may have gotten hold of the handguns after he got into the military facility			0
@entity372 what we know : the incident will certainly rev up the often explosive debate over gun control			0
but initial reports show @entity4 obtained his primary weapon legally			0
what we do n't know : will the shooting at @entity6 change the political landscape ? high - profile shootings over the last several years have done little to move the needle in @entity62			1
president @entity385 pushed for universal background checks and other directives after the the @entity389 , @entity390 , shootings , to cut down on the access @entity164 would have to firearms , but they never gained traction			0
at the state level , it 's been a similar story			0
the successful recall elections last week of two @entity399 lawmakers who backed new gun restrictions sent a shiver through the gun control lobby .			0

new : it 's unclear how @entity4 got a shotgun past security
new : a @entity62 police officer ended the 30 - minute spree by killing @entity4 , mayor says
@entity4 had issues in the @entity6 and with police , but still had security clearance
authorities do n't know his motive , and friends say they *'re* *surprised* by attack
