-- the mother of a woman who burst into a @entity4 hotel to tell journalists that she had been beaten and raped by troops loyal to @entity8 leader @entity7 said monday that her daughter is still being held			1
her claim contradicts an earlier statement from the government , which has said that @entity13 was released and is at home with her family			1
" yesterday , late at night at 3 a.m. , they called me from @entity21 , " @entity7 's compound in @entity4 , @entity17 's mother told @entity19 television monday			1
" and they told me : make your daughter @entity24 change her statement ... and we will release her immediately and whatever you ask for you will get , whether money , or a new apartment , or guaranteeing financial security for you and your children			1
but just tell @entity24 to change her statement			2
" a government spokesman said sunday that @entity17 had been released and was with her family			1
spokesman @entity34 said then that @entity17 and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by " one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family			1
" he refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that @entity8 society is " very conservative			1
" a group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach @entity47 's sister 's house monday , but were blocked by security forces			2
the sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in @entity4 told @entity0 , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel			2
the family of @entity17 said she is a lawyer -- and not a prostitute or mentally ill as @entity8 government officials initially said after the incident			1
the government has since changed its story , saying she is sane and pursuing a criminal case			2
@entity47 's father told @entity19 that his daughter " has her full mental capabilities and she is a graduate of law school and a lawyer and she is pursuing higher education in @entity4			1
and she was kidnapped by @entity7 's tyrannical forces			1
" " i am not ashamed of my daughter , " @entity17 's mother , who spoke from an undisclosed location in @entity8 , told the network			1
" i am proud of her because she has broken the barrier			0
she broke the barrier that no man can break			0
and those dogs there with him , @entity7 , ( are ) the criminals ! " she urged the youth of @entity8 to take action			1
@entity47 burst into a @entity4 hotel as international journalists were having breakfast saturday morning			0
her face was bruised , as were her legs			0
she showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh			0
speaking in @entity89 , she said she was from the rebel stronghold of @entity91 and had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men			0
though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , @entity0 could not independently verify @entity97 's story			2
" look at what @entity7 's brigades did to me , " she said			1
" my honor was violated by them			0
" @entity47 displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles			0
government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted			2
security forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife			2
" traitor ! " he shouted			0
another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head			0
one government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt			0
others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment			0

" @entity0 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
