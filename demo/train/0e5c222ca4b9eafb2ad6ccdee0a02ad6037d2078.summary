-- @entity2 authorities say there 's no evidence to back up a 19 - year - old @entity7 woman 's claim that one of the countless killings she carried out was in their state			2
@entity12 told a newspaper reporter over the weekend that she killed so many people across so many states in the last six years that she lost count			1
she told the @entity18 newspaper in @entity19 , @entity7 , that the killings spanned from @entity2 to @entity21			2
however , @entity22 said tuesday @entity24 's claims do n't bear out -- at least in their state			2
" at this time the @entity22 are not aware of any information -- beyond @entity24 's comments quoted in the press -- or evidence that would implicate @entity24 with a homicide committed in @entity2 , " a statement from the agency said			1
the agency said it has been in contact with @entity7 authorities			0
" we will follow up on any credible lead that is provided to us , " the statement said			0
claims invite skepticism @entity24 told the newspaper that she began killing when she was 13			1
she took credit for more than 22 but fewer than 100 killings , @entity18 reporter @entity41 told @entity0 affiliate @entity43			1
authorities have n't verified her claims , although they are investigating			1
@entity24 and her husband , @entity12 , 22 , do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42 - year - old @entity50 , who police say the couple lured with a @entity54 ad , strangled , repeatedly stabbed and dumped in a yard			1
if her other claims are true , @entity24 would be one of the nation 's most prolific serial killers			2
@entity59 , known as the @entity60 , pleaded guilty to killing 49 women in @entity62 in the 1980s and 1990s			0
@entity63 may have killed as many as 65 young men in the 1970s and early 1980s			0
based on the numbers she gave @entity41 , @entity24 would have had to kill on average somewhere between every three weeks and every three months			0
yet in the 2013 killing , police documents show @entity24 told police she and her husband could n't clean up all the blood @entity50 's killing left in her @entity73 , and that one of the ways investigators traced the killing to her was her own cell phone			1
the last number dialed on @entity80 's phone led to @entity24 , according to police			0
even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple , @entity85 district attorney @entity84 , said he discounts @entity24 's other claims			0
" as of this date , there has been no verification of any of the information that has been subject of media coverage regarding prior acts of the defendant , @entity12 , " @entity84 said in a statement			1
" any information regarding crimes committed in other jurisdictions has been or will be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the @entity99 for further investigation , " he said			0
woman accused in @entity54 slaying tells newspaper : i 've killed lots of others @entity0 's @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 contributed to this report .			0
