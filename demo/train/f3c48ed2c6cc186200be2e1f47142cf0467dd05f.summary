@entity2 media had reported wednesday that the @entity11 intelligence leaker was issued a document that would allow him to wait elsewhere in @entity2 while his request for temporary asylum was considered			1
but @entity1 , after meeting with @entity4 in @entity17 's transit area wednesday , told reporters that @entity4 had n't received the certificate and that he would remain in the transit area for now			1
that certificate still could come at " any time , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
interactive : @entity4 's options the news is the latest development in @entity4 's search for a place to settle after the @entity11 charged him with espionage			1
the former @entity31 contractor , who admitted last month to revealing sweeping @entity11 electronic surveillance programs to the news media , left @entity34 for @entity6 on june 23			1
since then , he 's been unable to leave the airport 's transit area because the @entity11 revoked his passport			1
@entity39 spokesman @entity38 said wednesday the @entity11 government is seeking " clarity " about @entity4 's status			1
and a spokeswoman for secretary of state @entity44 said @entity45 would find it " disappointing " if @entity4 were allowed to leave the airport			1
@entity44 spoke with his @entity2 counterpart , foreign minister @entity48 , on wednesday morning , spokeswoman @entity47 said			2
" he reiterated our belief , which we stated publicly and privately , that mr. @entity4 needs to be returned to the @entity11 , where he will face a fair trial , " @entity47 said			2
@entity0 exclusive : @entity53 on @entity4 @entity4 applied for temporary asylum in @entity2 on july 16			2
if granted , he would be able to live in @entity2 , and even travel abroad , for at least a year , @entity1 said last week			0
a ruling on the application could take months			0
but @entity1 has said that the @entity2 government could issue him a certificate that would allow him to leave the airport and wait somewhere else in the country while the application is considered			2
on wednesday , @entity1 said that he is in daily contact with @entity2 authorities about securing @entity4 permission to leave the airport , state - run media outlet @entity62 reported			1
if @entity4 is granted temporary asylum in @entity2 , it 's unclear whether he 'd try to move elsewhere			1
he 's previously indicated that he eventually wanted refuge in @entity71			0
but @entity1 suggested last week that @entity4 might take his time in @entity2			2
" as far as i know , he 's planning to stay in @entity2 to learn @entity2 culture , @entity2 language and ( to ) live here , " @entity1 told @entity0 last week			0
@entity45 has no extradition agreement with @entity2 , and @entity78 agents who work at the @entity11 embassy there have no authority to make arrests			2
@entity2 president @entity83 said this month that @entity4 would need to " stop his work aimed at harming our @entity71 partners " if he wanted to stay in the country			0

official : @entity4 did n't access ' crown jewels ' of @entity31 intel the presidents of @entity98 and @entity99 have said their countries would give @entity4 asylum , and @entity103 's president said he would offer it " if circumstances permit			0
" but he would need the legal ability to travel there -- something that temporary asylum in @entity2 could give him			0
the @entity11 government has asked @entity2 to expel @entity4			1
absent that , it will watch carefully the route he takes if he tries to reach one of the @entity71 countries willing to take him in			0
the @entity11 could grab @entity4 if any plane carrying him were to refuel in a country that respects @entity11 arrest warrants			0
but he probably will be careful to avoid that scenario			0
nevertheless , the @entity11 has sent provisional arrest warrants to a number of countries where @entity4 could either transit or seek asylum , a @entity11 official said last week			0
