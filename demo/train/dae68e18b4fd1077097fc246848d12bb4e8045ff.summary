" it only takes one virus to get through for a person to be infected , " explained dr. @entity1			0
this is true of any viral infection , but in this instance , @entity1 is referring to @entity6 and his ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine against the virus			1
" it 's been so difficult to make an hiv / aids vaccine			1
" those were the words of many working in hiv vaccine development until the results of a 2009 trial in @entity16 surprised everyone			1
" the field is energized , " said @entity1 , director of the @entity18 at the @entity20 @entity19 , describing the change in atmosphere in the vaccine community			2
the trial included over 16,000 volunteers and was the largest clinical trial ever conducted for a vaccine against @entity6			1
it was also the first to show any protection at all against infection			0
two previously developed vaccines , known as @entity6 and @entity33 , were used in combination , with the first priming an immune response against @entity6 and the second used as a booster once the immunity waned			1
the duo reduced the risk of contracting @entity6 by 31.2 % -- a modest reduction , but it was a start			1
to date , only four vaccines have made it as far as testing for efficacy to identify their levels of protection against @entity6			1
only this one showed any protection			0
" that trial was pivotal , " @entity1 said			2
" prior to that , it was n't known whether a vaccine could be possible			2
" in recent years , there have been parallel findings of an equally pivotal nature in the field of hiv prevention , including the discovery that people regularly taking their antiretroviral treatment reduce their chances of spreading @entity6 by 96 % and that men who are circumcised reduce their risk of becoming infected heterosexually by approximately 60 %			1
both improved access to antiretrovirals and campaigns to increase male circumcision in high - risk populations have taken place since the discoveries , and although numbers of new infections are falling , they 're not falling fast enough			0
in 2013 , there were 35 million people estimated to be living with @entity6 globally			1
there were still 2.1 million new infections in 2013 , and for every person who began treatment for @entity6 last year , 1.3 people were newly infected with the lifelong virus , according to @entity82			1
a vaccine remains essential to control the epidemic			2
a complex beast scientists like @entity1 have dedicated their careers to finding a vaccine , and their road has been tough due to the inherently complicated nature of the virus , its aptitude for mutating and changing constantly to evade immune attack , and its ability attack the very immune cells that should block it			2
there are nine subtypes of @entity6 circulating in different populations around the world , according to the @entity101 , and once inside the body , the virus can change continuously			1
" within an individual , you have millions of variants , " explained dr. @entity104 , chief scientific officer for the @entity105			0
@entity6 invades the body by attaching to , and killing , cd4 cells in the immune system			1
these cells are needed to send signals for other cells to generate antibodies against viruses such as @entity6 , and destroying those enables @entity6 to cause chronic lifelong infections in those affected			1
measles , polio , tetanus , whooping cough -- to name a few -- all have vaccines readily available to protect from their potentially fatal infections			0
but their biology is seemingly simple in comparison with @entity6			1
" for the older ones , you identify the virus , either inactivate it or weaken it , and inject it , " @entity104 said			0
" you trick the body into thinking it is infected with the actual virus , and when you 're exposed , you mount a robust immune response			0
" this is the premise of all vaccines , but the changeability of @entity6 means the target is constantly changing			2
a new route is needed , and the true biology of the virus needs to be understood			0
" in the case of @entity6 , the old empirical approach is n't going to work , " @entity104 said			2
scientists have identified conserved regions of the virus that do n't change as readily , making them prime targets for attack by antibodies			0
when the success of the @entity16 trial was studied deep down at the molecular level , the protection seemed to come down to attacking some of these conserved regions			1
now it 's time to step it up			0
in january , the mild success in @entity16 will be applied in @entity160 , where over 19 % of the adult population is living with @entity6			1
the country is second only to bordering @entity163 for having the highest rates of @entity6 in the world			2
" the @entity16 vaccine was made for strains ( of @entity6 ) circulating in @entity16 , " said dr. @entity166 , principal investigator for the @entity167 , which is leading the next trial in @entity160			1
the strain , or subtype , in this case was subtype @entity179 " for @entity160 , we 've formed a strain with common features to ( that ) circulating in the population			2
" this region of the world has subtype @entity182 an additional component , known as an adjuvant , is being added to the mix to stimulate a stronger and hopefully longer - lasting level of immunity			0
" we know durability in the @entity16 trial waned , " @entity166 said			1
if safety trials go well in 2015 , larger trials for the protective effect will take place the following year			0
an ideal vaccine would provide lifelong protection , or at least for a decade , as with the yellow fever vaccine			0
a broad attack the excitement now reinvigorating researchers stems not only from a modestly successful trial but from recent successes in the lab and even from @entity6 patients themselves			1
some people with @entity6 naturally produce antibodies that are effective in attacking the hiv virus in many of its forms			1
given the great variability of @entity6 , any means of attacking these conserved parts of the virus will be treasured and the new found gold comes in the form of these antibodies -- known as " broadly neutralizing antibodies			1
" scientists including @entity104 set out to identify these antibodies and discover whether they bind to the outer coat of the virus			0
the outer envelope , or protein coat , of @entity6 is what the virus uses to attach to , and enter , cells inside the body			2
these same coat proteins are what vaccine developers would like our antibodies to attack , in order to prevent the virus from entering our cells			2
" broadly neutralizing antibodies " could hold the key because , as their name suggests , they have a broad remit and can attack many subtypes of @entity6			1
" we will have found the achilles heel of @entity6 , " @entity104 said			2
out of 1,800 people infected with @entity6 , @entity104 and his team found that 10 % formed any of these antibodies and just 1 % had extremely broad and potent antibodies against @entity6			1
" we called them the elite neutralizers , " he said of the latter group			0
the problem , however , is that these antibodies form too late , when people are already infected			2
in fact , they usually only form a while after infection			0
the goal for vaccine teams is to get the body making these ahead of infection			0
" we want the antibodies in advance of exposure to @entity6 , " explained @entity104			1
the way to do this goes back to basics : tricking the body into thinking it is infected			0
" we can start to make vaccines that are very close mimics of the virus itself , " @entity1 said			0
teams at his research center have gained detailed insight into the structure of @entity6 in recent years , particularly the outer coat , where all the action takes place			2
synthesizing just the outer coat of a virus in the lab and injecting this into humans as a vaccine could " cause enough of an immune response against a range of types of @entity6 , " @entity1 said			1
the vaccine would not contain the virus itself , or any of its genetic material , meaning those receiving it have no risk of contracting @entity6			1
but for now , this new area remains just that : new			0
" we need results in humans , " @entity1 said			0
rounds of development , safety testing and then formal testing in high - risk populations are needed , but if it goes well , " in 10 years , there could be a first - generation vaccine			0
" if improved protection is seen in @entity160 , a first - generation vaccine could be with us sooner			1
making an impact when creating vaccines , the desired level of protection is usually 80 % to 90 %			2
but the high burden of @entity6 and potentially beneficial impact of lower levels of protection warrant licensing at a lower percentage			1
" over 50 % is worth licensing from a public health perspective , " @entity104 said , meaning that despite less shielding from any contact with the hiv virus , even a partially effective vaccine would save many lives over time			1
the next generations will incorporate further advancements , such as inducing neutralizing antibodies , to try to increase protection up to the 80 % or 90 % desired			1
" that 's the history of vaccine research ; you develop it over time , " @entity166 said			0
he has worked in the field for over 25 years and has felt the struggle			0
" i did n't think it would be this long or this hard ... but it 's been interesting , " he ponders			0
but there is light at the end of tunnel			0
" there has been no virus controlled without a vaccine , " he concluded when explaining why , despite antiretrovirals , circumcision and increased awareness , the need for a one - off intervention like a vaccine remains strong			0
" most people that transmit it do n't even know they have it , " he said			0
" to get that epidemic , to say you 've controlled it , requires vaccination			0

in 2009 , hiv vaccine trial in @entity16 to offered *glimmers* of hope for a future vaccine
a modified form of the vaccine is to be tested in @entity160 from january
broadly neutralizing antibodies could offer another avenue against the range of @entity6 viruses
protective levels of 50 % would have an impact on public health
