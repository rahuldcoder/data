" @entity57 has provided nonlethal aid , but promised weapons have not materialized			0
the @entity27 is active in every @entity1 province and reportedly has 80,000 men under @entity31 ' control			1

fighters seeking a more cohesive structure and stronger ideology desert to @entity69 units			1
others leave for better - funded brigades			0
moderate @entity72 moderate @entity69 groups identify with the ideology of the @entity77			1

@entity135 groups joined forces in december 2012 to create the @entity137 ( @entity137 )			2

members say the organization has more than 30,000 fighters , including some foreigners , but mostly @entity1			1
the @entity137 has shunned suicide bombing but uses car bombs to target regime forces			2
though its platform is vague , it constantly references the integral role of @entity97 in @entity1 's future , but declares " our course is the centrist and moderate course , far from exceeding the proper bounds of religion			1
" as proof , it offers ambiguous assurances to minorities			0
the @entity137 asserts that its conflict is limited to @entity1			1
@entity135 brigades cooperate with all other rebel units			2
they work with @entity30 journalists but eschew their governments			0

@entity176 pioneered the use of suicide bombing , targeting both civilian and military targets			0

as jihadists grow in strength , they have sidelined other brigades , and captured their bases and weapons			2
nevertheless , they cooperate with rebel groups across the ideological spectrum			1
@entity27 criminal outfits as consolidation occurs within the rebel ranks , @entity27 units that dabble in criminal activity are increasingly being squeezed			1
in @entity93 , smugglers created the @entity222			0
the group earned hefty fees controlling the @entity226 border crossing			0
but its criminal activities led other units to break up its monopoly			0
recently it was forced to relinquish partial control of @entity226 , and @entity187 has taken over many of its checkpoints			0
the @entity93 - based @entity235 , another brigade whose leaders have criminal roots , has seen a similar decline			0
as the @entity27 has lost ground , jihadists and @entity25 have gradually become the most important actors in the @entity1 revolution			1
and an @entity23 strike against the regime will only make them stronger .			1
