-- now that the midterm elections are over , the presidential election begins			1
a significant number of potential candidates in both parties participated in the midterm elections , understanding that this was an important opportunity to enhance their national profile and to demonstrate what they could do for their party			1
the candidates are also shrewd enough to understand that the congressional environment and legislative relations with president @entity15 will shape the political landscape for 2016			1
so , how did all the big players do ? @entity18 the results were mixed for the former secretary of state			1
without any question , the defeat of the @entity22 in the @entity24 campaigns and the plummeting approval ratings of the president for whom she served pose a big challenge for her			1
the candidates she supported did n't do so well			2
the new @entity33 will offer a powerful platform for the @entity35 to keep chipping away at the president , and @entity15 will have trouble passing any bills that she can in turn boast about on the campaign trail			2
meanwhile , the results are no doubt going to embolden some @entity35 , someone such as @entity44 perhaps , to step into a presidential fight they might otherwise have skipped			2
one bit of good news for her , though , is that the @entity33 will offer a perfect foil			2
nobody has been better at using the theme of @entity35 extremism than @entity54 , an approach she honed while first lady as a way to push back against an aggressive @entity35 in the 1990s			2
if @entity35 have trouble controlling themselves as the party in power , @entity54 will be in perfect position to bring back the arguments about the dangers of right - wing extremism and to remind voters that while she served in the @entity24 , she was able to build rather than burn bridges			2
@entity68 speaking of bridges , the @entity70 governor received a much - needed boost from these elections			2
the governor has been struggling to regain his standing ever since " @entity79 " ended the air of inevitability that surrounded his candidacy			2
until recently , @entity68 was damaged goods			2
the pundits speculated as to whether he would survive			2
yet @entity68 resisted the pressure to close up shop			2
and , most importantly , he used his position as the chairman of the @entity88 to rebuild his national profile and demonstrate that he could still deliver @entity35 votes -- and campaign contributions			2
with high - profile gubernatorial victories in @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and possibly @entity96 , @entity68 comes out of the elections in much better shape			2
though he suffered some losses in states such as @entity103 , there were enough big wins to strengthen his reputation			2
of course , the irony is that the victories of several high - profile republicans , such as @entity109 in @entity93 , will create new problems , since that particular governor might very well run in 2016			1
@entity109 so far , @entity109 has survived controversy of his own , and this strong re-election win is sure to energize his supporters			0
he is clearly much more damaged as a candidate than a few years ago after facing a recall election			0
that came about from a row over curtailing the bargaining rights for public employee union members			0
but many @entity35 are enamored with the tough - on - unions @entity109 , with his executive experience in a @entity22 state			0
@entity125 the relatively unknown @entity22 outgoing governor from @entity127 does n't come out of the elections in any better shape than when he started			0
unlike @entity35 @entity130 or @entity132 @entity131 , @entity125 did n't shine on the campaign trail			1
worse , in a major upset , democrat @entity134 lost out in the race to succeed him to @entity35 @entity138			1
@entity125 's critics will be asking why he could n't deliver			1
@entity131 she continues to insist that she wo n't run			0
but the midterms were good for sen. @entity141 , even if @entity22 took a thumping			1
@entity141 has positioned herself as a critic of her own party , warning president @entity15 and others that they have not been doing enough for struggling middle class @entity149			0
exit polls suggesting economic concerns were front and center for much of the electorate seem to bolster her approach			0
the thumping @entity22 suffered tuesday night will surely prompt more soul - searching within the party and pressure for a candidate who , unlike @entity54 , seems to offer fresh ideas			1
@entity161 on the surface , the midterm results look like a great thing for sen. @entity161			0
after all , he is the conservative firebrand who has spent the past year campaigning for candidates and making the case that the @entity35 is alive and well			0
he has been a superstar as he has shaped the conversation within the @entity35			0
but now that @entity161 is in the majority , he will also be under greater scrutiny , and his ability to govern will be tested -- until now , the senator has seemed to enjoy the role of maverick and the freedom that comes from being the party of opposition			0
at a time when many @entity35 will see the 2014 elections as evidence that the establishment is in better shape to win than the tea party , he can also expect to start receiving push back from his own party			0
@entity186 @entity186 was once the clear frontrunner for the @entity35 in 2016			1
but his star has faded over time , not least because his party killed most efforts to pass immigration reform			0
other candidates , such as @entity161 and sen. @entity130 , also stole some of his conservative thunder			1
still , as part of the @entity24 majority , @entity186 now has an opportunity to show what he can do			0
with @entity161 dismissed by critics as the ultraconservative @entity35 , @entity186 has a chance to show that he can govern and form the kind of coalitions -- within his own party and maybe with centrist @entity22 -- that would be attractive to voters frustrated with @entity203			0
if he could somehow build momentum on immigration reform , @entity186 could yet emerge as one of the stronger @entity35 candidates in the 2016 primaries			1
@entity130 if anyone doubted that @entity130 is thinking of running for president , his intentions now should be crystal clear			1
@entity130 posted photographs on his @entity215 page of @entity54 campaigning with candidates who lost			1
and in @entity218 , @entity130 said in an interview that voters had rejected both @entity221 and what they stood for			1
@entity130 has shaped himself into one of the more exciting voices in the @entity35			1
but he still has many potential liabilities , including the anti-interventionist foreign policy position he has staked out , at a moment when there seem to be multiple crises demanding @entity149 attention			0
however , he has also consistently drawn huge crowds on the campaign trail , and he has been able to position himself as a new voice in the party			0
this suggests he might be able to tap into the enthusiasm of tea party @entity35 , while still appealing to younger voters who usually shy away from the @entity35			0
he might also be able to appeal to mainstream republicans looking for a candidate such as then - sen. @entity15 back in 2008			0
being part of the majority will give him a greater opportunity to showcase his arguments			0
@entity44 the former governor of @entity95 comes out of this election with a party that has momentum and feels that a presidential victory is possible in 2016			1
they will be searching for a candidate who can win , and for many republicans , that person is @entity44			0
the voting tuesday seemed to confirm that establishment republicans are the way forward for the party , and no one represents the establishment like @entity44			1
@entity44 also continues to stick to his position on issues such as immigration that separate him from others in his party			0
@entity265 though he insists that he wo n't run , the truth is that the midterms have bolstered the notion that he should			1
@entity265 showed that he is still a valuable asset on the campaign trail , and that he can deliver on fundraising			0
and as the speculation about him running intensified ahead of tuesday 's vote , there was a distinct sense that he was n't quite as set against the idea as before			1
the odds remain slim that he 'll run , never mind win			0
but those odds look shorter than they did			0
these are n't the only potential candidates whose stock rose or fell tuesday night			1
@entity285 gov. @entity284 , for one , will likely be trying to figure out what this election means for his aspirations			0
as will @entity289 , @entity291 's @entity35 governor , who won re-election soundly			1
and that is one thing that tuesday did not change -- the possibility that a candidate could come out of nowhere			1
in the meantime , even as some votes are still being counted , @entity22 and @entity35 across the country will be mulling over this week 's election to determine whether there is enough in the results to suggest that they might be the best candidate for 2016 .			1

midterms have only just finished , but 2016 race has begun , @entity304 says
@entity18 had a mixed night tuesday , @entity304 says
@entity304 : @entity130 surely laid to rest doubts he 's running
