-- the enduring symbol of the government shutdown was when @entity4 veterans stormed the barricades on the @entity6			1
they reminded those of us in public service that they fought and died so we could resolve our differences peacefully			2
nowhere on our monuments will you read the words : " i will not negotiate			2
" in fact , our monuments tell the opposite story			2
our @entity6 is a monument to compromise and sacrificial leadership			1
as the debate about how to end the government shutdown converges with a debate over the nation 's borrowing limit , the real decision @entity23 faces is whether to make hard choices now or later			1
we do n't need short - term extensions as much as we need a long - term spending addiction recovery plan			1
we are out of control			2
@entity33 should do what any responsible parent would do if their adolescent child could n't handle the responsibility of a credit card			1
we should cut up the credit card and live within our means			2
if we do nothing , sooner or later we 'll see the @entity42 's worst fears realized -- a sudden interest rate spike , a collapse of our credit rating and a global economic meltdown			2
people of good faith on both sides agree on the math. there is no way we can grow fast enough to avoid massive -- and debilitating -- tax increases or structural changes to our entitlement programs			0
my friend @entity57 , who served as chief of staff to president @entity60 , put it best when he said we face the " most predictable economic crisis in history			1
" so when treasury secretary @entity64 says failing to lift the debt ceiling would be playing with fire , he 's the one on the wrong side of economics and history			0
the real danger is not solving the underlying problem of overspending that requires us to raise the debt ceiling			1
as @entity75 's @entity74 has explained , not raising the debt limit will not cause a default and will leave our " creditworthiness intact			0
" regardless , we can , and should , act now to avoid further crisis in the future			1
the good news is we have plenty of options			0
the president 's own budget is a good place to start			1
in it he proposed $ 435 billion in savings over the next decade that many @entity89 would accept			0
why would he not work with us to enact those savings ? specifically , the president proposed using a more accurate way to adjust for inflation with @entity94 benefits and other federal payments			1
his proposal could save $ 230 billion over 10 years			0
why should this idea be off limits ? the president also proposed saving $ 50 billion over the next decade by asking wealthy seniors to pay a little more for their @entity102 premiums			1
i introduced a bill with @entity106 sen. @entity105 building on this policy			0
why should our bipartisan bill inspired by the president be off the table ? this week i released a report with @entity106 sens. @entity112 and @entity113 and @entity114 sen. @entity114			1
featured on " @entity116 , " it exposed a " disability industrial complex " that is riddled with fraud			0
the @entity119 will be bankrupt by 2016			1
millions of disabled @entity120 will face benefit cuts or middle - income @entity120 will face an increase in their payroll taxes			1
why should we raise the debt ceiling without working to cut the billions in waste and fraud that has been uncovered in our bipartisan investigations ? meanwhile , the nonpartisan @entity131 has detailed $ 250 billion in duplication in our discretionary budget that both parties have largely ignored			0
why would we impose billions of dollars of additional debt on future generations when we could instead find billions in additional savings ? i 'm pleased my colleagues in the @entity42 are making similar and additional proposals of their own			0
the fact is the menu of options from numerous commissions and proposals amounts to trillions in savings			0
what we need is the political courage to act			0
the real question is : if now is not the time to negotiate , then when ? delaying these decisions might be good for our political security , but it will seriously undermine our economic and national security			1
our founders understood that politicians and factions would always be tempted to not compromise , and would try to ideologically cleanse the public square of meaningful opposition			1
this hyperpartisan mentality was on display with both the passage of @entity163 and the counterproductive backlash in my own party			0
the result has been a government shutdown			1
as someone with a record of cutting spending and holding popular -- but costly -- bills , i 'm not afraid to say that principled compromise is courageous , and neither should anyone in public office			1
i believe the very compromises that gave us our nation can be used to save our nation			0
as much as i would love to see 67 pure conservatives in the @entity181 , that is n't going to happen			0
and as much as i would love to cut spending by $ 9 trillion , as i detailed in my own " @entity184 " plan , i 'll settle for less if we can save @entity120 in the process			2
at pivotal moments , our best leaders have always chosen negotiation and compromise over domination and humiliation			2
@entity192 could have been king but he gave up power			0
@entity194 chose reconstruction over retribution			0
@entity197 gave our vanquished foes a new beginning with the @entity200 , and he even let @entity201 keep its emperor , and with it secured the peace			0
it 's time for president @entity205 , and all our congressional leaders , to do the same			2
all our problems can be solved , but only if we participate			0
the time to do so is now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			1

@entity211 : we need a long - term deal , not short - term extensions in shutdown crisis
@entity211 : the real danger is not solving the problem of our spending addiction
he says for example , the @entity119 will be bankrupt by 2016
@entity211 : the president and @entity33 must show real leadership and compromise
