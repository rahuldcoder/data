-- for the generation of @entity4 artists who came of age under @entity7 's regime in the 1980s , one common subject was the dictator himself , often depicted holding a sword or riding an arabian horse			1
politics aside , those were good days for artists , says @entity14 , 49 , an @entity4 sculptor who considers his commissioned work of @entity7 to be an achievement			1
" working as an artist in @entity4 , when @entity7 was president , was a golden period for all artists , not just myself			1
he was supportive of artists and was open to them , " he says			2
" but we were n't open to the world for security reasons , and that 's it			2
" receiving small recognition from @entity7 was important to him as a budding artist , @entity14 says			1
as a student he entered a large competition -- one that he did not expect to win -- and @entity7 attended the event			1
upon viewing his work , " @entity7 himself told me that the idea was nice , and that 's the only thing i remember from the whole competition , " he says			1

some were made for aesthetics and others to reflect events or issues that the country faced , he says			0
his memories of the time under @entity7 can verge on idyllic			1
" there was never a day , for any artist in any form of art , who was forced to work for @entity7 or the country , " he says			2
" we were all happily working , and there were competitions that anyone can participate in			2
" and when @entity7 fell in 2003 , so too did @entity14 's statues			1
he says it is disheartening to think of art being torn down			0
now living in @entity68 , @entity14 still sculpts using various mediums , but there are stumbling blocks			0
few people there want to buy large statues , he says , and there is not even a foundry for his bronze works			2
he has to mail molds more than 1,000 miles away to @entity79 , and the bronze rarely survives the return journey intact			0
in @entity68 , " the art movement is still yet to begin in the right way			0
it did start , but it needs more solidarity and extra encouragement from certain entities for it to be mature , " he says			0

and he says art has nothing to do with politics or religion			0
as for his associations with the dictator , it only meant he was at the top of his game			0
" i do not regret that i once worked for @entity7 , " he said			1
only the best artists work for presidents			0

under @entity7 's regime , @entity110 was commissioned to create works depicting the dictator
@entity43 , a sculptor , says artists received much support from @entity7
he says working for @entity7 was only a " fact of history " and does not regret it
