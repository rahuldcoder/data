-- " @entity3 , @entity5 - nine @entity4 , builds a new aero - dynamic car at popular prices ... this year @entity3 does the unexpected again ... introduces not one new car ... but two ! ... we ca n't describe the new @entity9 model			1
you will have to see it yourself to know how truly beautiful it is			2
" go to a public library or a used - books - and - periodicals store sometime , select at random an @entity16 magazine from decades ago , flip through the pages at your leisure			1
what may strike you is not the now - forgotten news stories , but the energy and effort expended , the enthusiasm displayed , in the advertisements extolling products that were prominent at the moment , and that today are nowhere to be seen			1
" when your head is stuffed up ! nothing helps a cold more than rest and sleep but you ca n't sleep when your head is stuffed up , and you ca n't enjoy your food when you ca n't smell and taste			1
if you want to have your head clear , enjoy your food and sleep peacefully , just buy a bottle of @entity34 , put a few drops in each nostril and see how much better you feel immediately			2
" @entity37 is as good a time as any to reflect upon what endures -- what matters -- in the life of @entity16 commerce and industry			1
what lasts are not the specific products we desire and purchase			1
people , for a while , decide they need or want them			0
we 're terrific at making stuff -- at conjuring what the market will go for , at expertly constructing and packaging it , at promoting and selling it			0
we 're so good at it that we sometimes forget that the thing to be most proud of is not the products , which are largely ephemeral , but the work -- the labor -- that goes into them			1
the products , those worthy and those without much worth at all , tend to disappear in time			1
the diligence and skill behind the labor renews itself each generation			0
" quieted down to a mere whisper ... it 's cushioned			0
@entity71 this significant feature of @entity73 now : there 's no ratchety rasp and bang when the carriage is thrown across the machine			0
just a gentle purring swish ... that 's all			0
" the products mentioned above were featured in the january 21 , 1935 , edition of @entity82			2
they shared the pages with promotions for the @entity86 on @entity87 in @entity88 ( " @entity91			0
400 outside rooms , 400 baths " ) , @entity95 automobiles ( " ride in one			0
prove to yourself that without doubt , @entity16 's finest motor - car is this year 's @entity95 " ) , and the @entity89 of cruise ships ( " @entity100 to the @entity101 and the @entity102 " )			1
all of them are now long departed			2
on this @entity37 , page through any magazine on the newsstand , click through the ads on any website , and you will encounter products that are fresh and enticing today , but that will have gone the way of the @entity95 or the @entity113 by the time your grandchildren who have n't yet been born are consumers			1
there 's optimistic news in that			0
by then , inventors and laborers and sales representatives will have come up with something they believe is better , something more suited to the needs of that era			0
they -- the creators , the work force -- are what maintains			1
in the summer of 1960 , when the medium of network television was still relatively new and booming , @entity127 presented a preview of the @entity131			0
on this archived video of the broadcast , you will notice the trumpeting of sponsors			0
there 's @entity138 ( " bringing the exciting story of people to 28 million readers every issue " )			0
there 's @entity145 cigarettes ( " the only cigarette with a filter made of tobacco -- an all - tobacco filter for that all - tobacco taste			2
" ) and , at the end of the broadcast , there 's an invitation to viewers : " if you have any question about the convention or its people , simply send a telegram to @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157			0
" look went out of business in 1971 ; @entity145 @entity145 and their all - tobacco filters drifted away like a waft of spent smoke ; and when you have an urgent question for someone all the way across the country , the impulse to send a telegram undoubtedly never occurs to you			2
" ask the man who owns one , " the @entity177 automobile company proclaimed in that old issue of @entity82			0
@entity177 went away in 1958 , but there are new ideas for new products and services being dreamed up right now			2
it 's the one certain thing about @entity16 life			1
given the opportunity , given a job to do , we know -- we always have known -- how to build			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190			1

@entity190 : ads for long - gone products a record of what lasts , what does n't , in @entity16 commerce
he says @entity37 *reminds* of enduring *importance* of worker as fashions , retail tides shift
who gets excited about a @entity3 , an @entity207 *typewriter* ? just the work force that built them
@entity190 : one certainty in @entity16 : given opportunity , @entity16 always have known how to build
