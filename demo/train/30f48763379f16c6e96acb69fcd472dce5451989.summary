@entity0 is a @entity1 political strategist and co-chair of the @entity3 , a pro-business advocacy organization			2
she was director of the @entity6 administration 's @entity4 from 2001 to 2003 and is ceo of the @entity8 , which specializes in market research about women and @entity11			0
@entity0 says it remains to be seen if @entity13 agrees with the broader @entity11 community 's values			1
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- the @entity19 administration has no intention of pushing comprehensive immigration reform any time soon , but with his nomination of judge @entity13 to the @entity24 , the president may have found a suitable consolation prize for the @entity11 community			1
hispanics gave 67 percent of their votes to president @entity19 , delivering key states like @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 to his electoral column , and sending him two new @entity36 senators and three new @entity37 @entity36 from those states alone			0
but the problem with identity politics is that not just any @entity11 will do			0
@entity19 made clear he wanted to pick a justice who would have empathy for those whose cases come before the court			1
as impressive as @entity13 's life story is , it remains to be seen whether she truly has the much - talked - about " empathy " for @entity11 values and dreams			1
if @entity13 is truly representative of our values , she will understand that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in the @entity11 community and is our best hope for moving @entity11 households solidly into the ranks of the @entity59 middle class			1
in a study earlier this year , @entity60 , the research arm of @entity61 , confirmed that there are at least 2.2 million @entity11 - owned businesses in the @entity59 , generating about $ 388 billion in combined revenue			1
empathy with the lives of millions of @entity11 today means that she must appreciate the impact of federal , state and municipal tax and regulatory schemes on individuals and small businesses alike			2
her writings should reflect the view that access to the marketplace is a constitutional guarantee no less important than freedoms of speech , religion or assembly			0
if she understands the hopes and aspirations of the @entity11 community , she should have a record of interpreting the @entity86 of the @entity87 in ways that encourage individual risk - taking , free enterprise and job creation , not in ways that discourage it			1
likewise , @entity13 should show evidence of being suspicious of government 's power			2
many @entity11 are fresh from regimes where the rule of law has been crushed or never existed ; we know that with centralized power comes arrogance , and that bureaucracies inevitably become cold , callous , unyielding and corrupt			0
she should be imbued with a core appreciation that our @entity87 establishes a government of limited , enumerated powers , and should have a record of writings and decisions that support the conclusion that she will err on the side of limiting , not expanding , the powers and influence of government			0
like all other immigrants , @entity11 came here with the hope of acquiring property for themselves and their children			0
we treasure as sacred our own homes , farms and land , and we know there is often little practical difference between broad government restrictions on the use and enjoyment of that property and its being taken outright			0
as a @entity24 justice , @entity13 should believe , as we @entity11 do , that the @entity87 affords us due process and just compensation in either case -- and that no property should be taken unless there is a legitimate public use			1
as everyone knows , at the core of the @entity11 experience are our families and the opportunity to freely exercise our religion			0
the next justice , if she is empathetic to our lives and values , will protect the sanctity of the family and of life itself			2
@entity19 's nomination of the first @entity150 to the @entity24 is a historic moment that has moved each of us , but our pride will be fleeting if she does n't really share @entity11 values			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			0

@entity0 : @entity19 sought a high - court nominee who would show empathy
but , @entity0 asks , as a justice , who would @entity13 empathize with ?
@entity11 community places high value on entrepreneurship and family , she says
@entity0 : will @entity13 share those values if confirmed to the court ?
