faster appointments to top government jobs			1
revised regulations and rules reflecting government policy			1
those are the practical impacts from the nuclear option @entity8 approved to end filibusters of most presidential nominations and appointments			1
@entity12 supports @entity8 's nuclear option to end some filibusters the politics of the move are messy , with majority democrats saying it was needed to end unprecedented obstruction by minority republicans , and @entity20 contending it was a power grab			1
both sides are right , at least in part			0
here are five things that will change because of the move : 1			0
easing @entity8 gridlock first and foremost , eliminating the ability of senators to block most nominations means the majority party -- in this case @entity8 -- can hold votes and approve presidential nominations and appointments more quickly			1
before the rule change , minority senators could mount a filibuster that required 60 votes in the 100 - member chamber to overcome			0
with @entity8 holding a 55 - 45 majority , the filibuster served as an effective minority veto			1
once a rare maneuver of specific opposition , the filibuster has become routine , especially since president @entity12 took office in 2009			0
according to senate majority leader @entity49 , the @entity51 @entity50 who spearheaded thursday 's nuclear option rule change , there have been 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominations in @entity8 history , with about half of them occurring during the @entity12 administration			1
in the @entity8 's first move after the 52 - 48 vote thursday to change the rules , it ended a filibuster against one of @entity12 's three nominees for a key federal appeals court in @entity68 who had been blocked by @entity20			1
the altered filibuster rules also will apply when the day comes that @entity20 hold the @entity8 majority , a fact emphasized by @entity20 leaders who decried the change			1
" this changes everything , " veteran @entity20 sen. @entity75 of @entity76 told reporters thursday			0
he blamed newer @entity81 senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue , adding : " they succeeded and they will pay a very , very heavy price for it			0
" what is the nuclear option ? 2			0
more new judges @entity12 and @entity8 have complained for months that @entity20 prevented the president from filling three vacancies on the @entity93 , considered the nation 's second most important judicial body behind the @entity96 because it handles many major government - related cases			1
the @entity93 appeals court became the focal point of the filibuster issue , with republicans blocking the three @entity12 nominees to prevent a more liberal - leaning majority on the panel that now has eight judges -- four considered conservative and four considered more liberal			2
@entity20 leaders argue the court caseload does n't require any more judges on the panel			2
now , the three @entity12 nominees -- @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 -- are likely to get @entity8 approval to join the @entity93 court in coming weeks or months			1
upcoming cases the court could consider include challenges to tougher @entity119 limits on carbon emissions and other regulatory issues			0
the @entity8 rule change specifically exempted @entity96 nominations , meaning they still can be filibustered , though some @entity20 argue that no such distinction exists			1
if @entity49 " changes the rules for some judicial nominees , he is effectively changing them for all judicial nominees , including the @entity96 , " conservative @entity20 sen. @entity125 of @entity126 said			0
" apparently the other side wants to change the rules while still preserving the ability to block a @entity20 president 's ability to replace a liberal @entity96 with an originalist			0
" both sides have been guilty of political hijinks over judicial nominees in the past			0
during the administration of president @entity144 , republicans who held the @entity8 majority in 2005 threatened the nuclear option to prevent @entity81 filibusters of @entity144 's judicial nominees			1
the confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators			0
@entity12 , then a senator , opposed the nuclear option at that time , saying on the @entity8 floor that " in the long run , it is not a good result for either party			2
" asked about @entity12 's past stance compared with his support thursday for @entity49 's move , @entity161 spokesman @entity160 cited increased obstruction of @entity12 nominees as the reason for needing to get the @entity8 working again			2
" the circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005 , " @entity160 said , noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when @entity12 took office compared to 93 today , and that many of the president 's nominees have bipartisan support but ca n't get an up - or - down @entity8 vote			1
@entity125 , however , noted that almost half of the 93 judicial vacancies today lack a nominee by the president			0
executive branch appointments when @entity12 nominated @entity183 as his defense secretary , the choice seemed safe from major @entity20 opposition in the @entity8 because @entity186 himself was a former @entity20 senator			2
however , the bitter partisan divide of @entity68 brought a @entity20 filibuster that initially prevented a final vote -- the first time in history that a defense secretary nominee had been blocked			0
" what seems to be happening , and this has been growing over time , is the @entity20 minority in the @entity8 seems to think that the rule now is that you need to have 60 votes for everything , " @entity12 complained at the time			2
the rule change means that @entity12 and future presidents will be able to fill @entity202 posts and agency leadership positions more freely so long as their party controls the @entity8			1
however , if divided government means the president is of a different party than the @entity8 majority , look for even more obstruction of such appointments in the future			1
rules and regulations a major target of @entity20 political attacks now is @entity218 secretary @entity217 , who oversees the implementation of the health care reforms passed by @entity8 in 2010 and despised by the political right			1
in her job , @entity217 oversees the setting of regulations and rules under the @entity226 , just like @entity119 administrator @entity227 is considering regulations on greenhouse gas emissions opposed by @entity20			0
that 's what agency and department heads do , and the ending of minority filibusters against a president 's nomination will mean faster implementation of an administration 's policies			1
by essentially lubricating the nomination process , the rule change increases the chances of more " @entity245 politics " in the future , with each new administration undoing regulations and policies of predecessors under the opposite party			1
man who coined the term ' nuclear option ' regrets ever pursuing it 5			0
@entity256 politics the @entity8 rules change applies only to appointments and nominations , not legislation			1
while some democrats call for a similar move to apply to proposed laws , such a step remains highly unlikely			0
however , @entity20 warn that the rule change will harm the political relationships between senators of different parties that can lead to bipartisan agreements and cooperation on drafting and passing laws			0
" there 's still quite a bit of legislation that goes through the @entity8 , and it 's done on the basis of people 's agreement and work with one another across the aisle , " @entity75 told @entity271 on thursday			2
" there are going to be difficulties from time to time where cooperation was probably the case in the past and will not be now			0
" with the @entity20 - controlled @entity161 already an opposition bulwark against @entity12 and @entity8 , the president needs the @entity8 to have any chance to push forward his agenda			2
what remains unclear is how much the nuclear option will stiffen @entity8 @entity20 resolve to join their generally more hardcore @entity161 conservative colleagues in efforts to repeal or dismantle @entity226 , prevent immigration reform and other policy stances			2
" we 're not going to shut down the @entity8 , " @entity75 said , then adding that " we 're going to focus on trying to repair @entity226 , which is plaguing the lives of millions of @entity297			2
" opinion : ' nuclear option ' makes @entity20 do its job			0

ending filibusters of some presidential nominations will ease @entity8 gridlock
expect more new judges and faster filling of government vacancies
a full team means more regulations reflecting administration policies
the changes apply to present and future administrations
