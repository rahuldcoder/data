-- president @entity1 on monday reiterated his call for a comprehensive package of steps against gun violence as the focus on possible @entity8 legislation appeared to narrow to expanded background checks and limited ammunition magazines , rather than a ban on semi-automatic rifles that mimic assault weapons			1
@entity1 took part in a discussion with @entity17 officials before telling police officers and others that an increase in gun violence nationwide , including the @entity22 school massacre in december , made it vital to address the issue now			1
" no law or set of laws can keep our children completely safe , " @entity1 said in calling for " basic , commonsense steps to reduce gun violence			1
" he added , " if there 's one life we can save , we 've got an obligation to try			0
" @entity1 emphasized his support for banning semi-automatic rifles modeled after military weapons as part of an updated version of an earlier weapons ban that expired in 2004			1
opponents led by the influential @entity41 , oppose any ban on weapons , and senate majority leader @entity44 has indicated that such a provision faced an uphill struggle			1
@entity44 told @entity47 on sunday that he backed expanding background checks to private gun sales at shows and other steps , but he refused to endorse a ban on what are called assault - style rifles modeled after military weapons			1
@entity1 shooting image gets blasted on the web a popular version is the @entity61 semi-automatic rifle that can be purchased with magazines holding 30 rounds			2
a similar weapon was used in the @entity22 school shooting that killed 20 first graders and revived a national focus on tougher gun control measures			1
while @entity1 and some top @entity71 , including sen. @entity72 of @entity73 , seek a ban on many semi-automatic rifles , the @entity41 and politicians from both major parties oppose such a move as an infringement on constitutional rights			2
in his remarks monday , @entity1 rejected that argument , urging supporters to tell opponents of renewed weapons ban that " there 's no legislation to eliminate all guns ; there 's no legislation being proposed to subvert the @entity89			1
" @entity1 's trip to @entity17 was intended to raise attention to steps taken in the city , including a recent regional gun summit hosted by mayor @entity95 and @entity97 mayor @entity96			2
both cities have experienced mass shootings in recent months , and @entity1 met with two @entity17 - area law enforcement officials last week when he discussed the issue with local police and sheriffs department members at the @entity105			2
the @entity41 and its leading supporters in @entity107 argue that steps proposed by @entity1 wo n't work and would fail to address the problem			0
for example , they say criminals skirt background checks , so expanding the system would miss the main target of the legislation			0
they also contend that the semi-automatic rifles targeted by @entity72 in a proposal introduced last week are used in a fraction of the nation 's gun violence			1
gun debate : where is the middle ground ? @entity1 and other supporters of stronger gun control measures say all possible efforts must be made to address what they call a chronic and growing problem of gun violence , particularly involving vulnerable targets such as students			1
@entity44 of @entity134 is the top @entity8 @entity135 , who sets the chamber 's legislative schedule			2
he said sunday that he wants the @entity138 to produce a bill that could be debated by the full @entity8 and would be open to proposed amendments by any senator			0
however , @entity44 signaled that the committee version would lack the ban on assault - style weapons			0
" if @entity72 , by the time it 's through the @entity138 , if she does n't have her assault weapons , at least let her have an opportunity to offer this amendment " on the @entity8 floor , @entity44 told @entity47			2
@entity44 , who noted he owned guns and was a former law officer , said he opposed the @entity153 - era assault weapons ban that expired midway through the @entity155 administration			1
he called for expanding background checks and steps to halt federal gun trafficking while saying the @entity8 should " take a look at " unspecified limits on ammunition magazines			2
asked about backing he has received from the @entity41 , @entity44 said that " just because they resist it does n't mean we ca n't do things			0
" other steps under consideration include better monitoring of people with mental illness to prevent them from obtaining guns			0
@entity71 have said the background check measure would stand the best chance of garnering bipartisan support , including from some pro-gun @entity71			0
even if passed by the @entity8 , a gun bill would face tougher scrutiny in the @entity177 - led @entity105			2
@entity1 said monday that lawmakers in @entity107 from both parties were working together on plans that would expand background checks to all gun purchases and criminalize " straw purchases " in which legal gun owners buy weapons for people prohibited from doing so			1
the faces of @entity189 's gun debate guns sold through private sales currently avoid background checks -- the so - called gun show loophole			0
@entity71 sen. @entity194 of @entity195 said last week that he was in talks with colleagues -- including several who are ranked highly by the @entity41 -- on possible legislation to expand background checks on private gun sales			0
sources close to both @entity194 and @entity203 sen. @entity203 of @entity204 told @entity0 the two were in serious discussions about co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen background checks			0
@entity194 sits on the @entity138 , while @entity203 is a former member			0
however , @entity41 chief executive @entity209 told the panel that the current background check system does n't work , so expanding it would only create an unmanageable government bureaucracy instead of reducing gun crime			0
during the @entity215 on sunday night , a group called @entity216 broadcast an ad showing the @entity41 's @entity209 , in 1999 , endorsing the expanded background checks his group now opposes			0
supporters of gun control argue that the constitutional right to bear arms can be limited , for example , by the existing ban on private citizens possessing grenade launchers and other military weaponry			1
however , @entity230 law professor @entity229 said last week that the @entity231 made clear that gun control could not include weapons used commonly by law - abiding citizens , such as the top - selling @entity61 that @entity72 's legislation would ban			1
@entity0 's @entity237 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity1 says no law can stop all gun violence , but the nation must try
new : @entity1 continues to call for reviving a ban on some weapons
