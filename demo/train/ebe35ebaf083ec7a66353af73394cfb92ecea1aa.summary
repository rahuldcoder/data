people who suffer from migraines with aura during middle age have double the risk of developing @entity5 or other movement disorders later in life than those who do not , according to a study published wednesday in the journal @entity11			1
migraines are the most common brain disorder in both men and women , according to the @entity15 , and one of the top 10 most debilitating conditions			1
@entity18 is the term used to describe the feelings and symptoms that happen shortly before and during a migraine			0
" roughly one - third of affected individuals can predict the onset of a migraine because it is preceded by an ' aura , ' visual disturbances that appear as flashing lights , zig - zag lines or a temporary loss of vision , " according to the @entity32			0
researchers followed more than 5,000 people between the ages of 33 and 65 for 25 years , who were originally enrolled in a clinical trial designed to study heart disease in @entity39			1
the participants were interviewed about migraine symptoms in middle age and then , about 25 years later , asked about @entity5 's disease symptoms			1
they were also asked about symptoms for a related disorder called @entity46			0
the results were based on the study participants ' self - reported diagnoses , though in the majority of the cases researchers confirmed the diagnoses by looking at medical records and the participants ' medication use			2
" the patients in this study were not carefully examined and definitely diagnosed with @entity5 , " said dr. @entity57 , national medical director of the @entity58 , which is why he believes more research is needed before drawing any conclusion that the two are related			0
" head trauma and other neurological issues can manifest with symptoms similar to parkinson 's disease and future studies will need to better control for these factors			1
" compared to those without headaches , people in the study who suffered from migraines with aura in middle age were about twice as likely to have been diagnosed with @entity5 when the researchers checked back			1
they were also more likely to report at least four symptoms commonly associated with @entity5 later in life			0
@entity5 's - like symptoms were also more common in those with migraine without aura , though the link was not as strong , lead study author @entity82 told @entity88 in an email			2
@entity82 , a professor of epidemiology at @entity91 in @entity92 , wants to make sure people understand the actual risk of @entity5 in people with migraine is still very low			0
researchers do n't yet understand why migraines might be linked to parkinson 's disease or other movement disorders , @entity82 says			1
they do n't believe that the link is due to medications taken to treat migraines , some of which block dopamine			2
nor do they think that the link is due to related brain diseases , " since we controlled for these factors			2
" possible explanations for the connection , she agrees , might be a previous head injury or a shared genetic risk factor that increases the risk for both migraine and parkinson 's disease			1
one common link may be abnormalities in dopamine production and dopamine receptors in the brain , said @entity57			2
some groups suggest the same dopamine treatment that helps @entity5 's patients may also help with migraines			0
" another theory is that in migraine sufferers there seems to be a higher deposition of metals , such as iron , in the brain and specifically in areas important to movement , " said @entity57			0
" some experts believe that this metal deposition may place patients at risk for diseases like @entity5 's			0

migraines are the most common brain disorder in men and women , @entity15 says
researchers followed more than 5,000 people for 25 years
experts say link between migraines and parkinson 's disease needs further study
