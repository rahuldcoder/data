-- @entity1 married for love , against her family 's wishes , more than a decade ago in the @entity5			1
shortly after the marriage , she and her husband , along with their two children , moved to @entity10 for work			1
there , she says , her husband began to drink , heavily			1
he became violent , holding a knife to her throat , she says			1
" he started raping me , which affected me mentally , lots of stress and the relationship between me and my sons			2
i could n't speak out because i learned that to speak out against your husband to anyone outside , it is big shame			1
" " so , i was struggling between eastern culture with what i learned and western culture where i should live freedom , equality , justice			2
" she still finds it difficult			2
@entity1 is not her real name			1
she spoke to @entity0 on condition of anonymity , saying she fears for her life			1
during her marriage , she says , the violence continued			2
she showed @entity0 police reports she eventually filed , but she decided not to pursue a case , and her husband was never charged			1
roughly eight years into the marriage , she ran away and met another man			2
she decided to ask for a divorce			1
opinion : condemn the powerful elite over ' honor ' murders " i told him i want a divorce			1
i do n't want to cheat on you			2
i said , all i want is relationship with my sons			2
" she says her husband initially agreed but insisted they both go back to their home in the @entity5 , to explain to their families			1
" he gathered all his family in his house			1
and i was shocked to see 60 or 70 people at his house			1
his mother called me by very bad names			1
she called me a prostitute in front of my sons			2
" i remember when my mother - in - law looked at my face and held my sons in her hands , big hands			1
she told me : ' my son is a doctor			2
you should hold your head up			2
who are you to cheat on my son ? who are you ? ' " after that , she told me : ' i will look after them , you do n't deserve to be a mother			1
and my sons were looking at me			0
' " then , @entity1 says , her husband issued a death sentence , calling her father in the neighboring town , demanding she be killed for dishonoring her family -- an " honor " murder			1
" he told my father , if you are a man , clean your shame			0
if you are a man , kill your daughter			0
" her sister warned her not to return home , she says			1
but she called her father to hear his voice one last time			0
" he told me : ' i miss you , i want to see you			0
' he did n't tell me what he heard from my husband [ about ordering her death ]			1
because he knows i would run away			0
he said ' come , i want to protect you			0
' " @entity1 was ready to flee her home in the @entity5			1
but she decided to see her father one last time , even though she knew it might have been a trap			0
a part of her , she says , almost wished for death			2
just rubbish ! i wanted to die			0
i wanted to disappear because i did n't want my father , or my brother , or my cousin to kill me			0
my son will carry my shame			0
" my father told my mother : ' the problem , i know , she did n't cheat on her husband			1
the problem is she brought us shame , shame that can not even be cleaned by blood			0
i know she 's innocent			0
but we ca n't clean this shame			0
" faced with this impossible choice , @entity1 says her father realized he had no alternative			1
' honor ' murderer boasts of triple killing " my father sent me away because he knew that i would be killed by my uncles or my cousins			0
there is no other option			0
he does n't want to get rid of me			0
but he wants to get rid of shame ... that i brought my family because of my stupidity , to be honest with my husband that i love another man			1
" so @entity1 's father banished her from their home in the @entity5 and sent her back to @entity10			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's husband filed for divorce in the @entity139 court of the couple 's hometown in the @entity5			1
this meant she was separated from her children , she says , without her knowledge or consent			0
much of @entity1 's story is hard to verify with her former husband			1
@entity0 has seen court documents and her applications for asylum , but @entity1 's case workers with a @entity10 women 's aid agency say we can not ask her husband for a response , for fear it may trigger a violent reaction			1
@entity1 has not returned to the @entity5 since leaving five years ago			1
when she left , her sister wrote to her imploring her never to return			0
" it will be your grave , " she wrote			0
@entity1 has now gained residency in @entity10 and has chosen to leave @entity163 , a decision that has cut her off from her children , who are now teenagers			1
when she last spoke to them , she says they told her they wanted no more contact with her			0
" they do n't want to hear my voice			0
it was very painful to hear that			0
i felt like i got divorced twice : from a husband and my sons			2
i 'm not angry with them			0
i 'm tired of culture and religion			0
i 'm very tired to be a woman			2
i 'm very tired to be a mother			2
" she is defiant when asked if she believes she will see her sons again			0
" i gave birth to my sons and i am a mother			2
i will not give up my right as a mother			2
i will fight until the end			0
they will be proud of me and i will be proud of them			0
i am sure about this			0
" @entity1 says she does not hate her husband or her own relatives , even though she still fears they may kill her for bringing shame on the family			1
she sees them all as victims -- like her -- of a brutal , unrelenting tradition , one that leading @entity196 thinkers insist has no place in @entity163			0
@entity10 court convicts parents in ' honor ' murder			0

one woman , " @entity1 , " describes *aftermath* of her decision to ask her husband for divorce
@entity1 says her husband gathered up to 70 family members to home in @entity5
there @entity1 says her mother - in - law *insulted* her , husband issued death sentence
@entity0 unable to speak to her husband for fear it may trigger a violent reaction
