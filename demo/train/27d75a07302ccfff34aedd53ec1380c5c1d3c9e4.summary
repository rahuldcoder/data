@entity0 -- senate majority leader @entity2 , @entity3 , may have to fold his efforts to push a measure legalizing online poker in the @entity7 into a tax - cut bill , in light of strenuous opposition from @entity11			1
such a provision would greatly benefit some of @entity2 's biggest campaign backers -- those in the gaming industry , which has been lobbying for the change			2
but when @entity2 was asked wednesday afternoon whether he was still pushing the poker bill during the congressional lame - duck session , he said , " we are still working on it , " according to this office			2
@entity23 and @entity11 sources had told @entity24 was pushing for the provision to be included in the bill to extend the @entity28 - era tax cuts			0
one of those leading the opposition is sen. @entity31 , @entity32 , who vowed to block any attempt to include the poker legalization in the tax bill			1
wednesday afternoon @entity31 told @entity1 the measure was dead , saying , " senator @entity2 has agreed with me that it will not happen			1
" @entity2 's office refused @entity1 's request to discuss his push for the legalization			2
the support by the four - term @entity44 @entity43 , who won re-election in november , for the online poker measure is an apparent reversal			1
when @entity48 addressed online betting in 2006 , @entity2 opposed its legalization			2
some @entity50 @entity11 also bristled at news @entity2 was attempting to shoehorn the @entity44 - friendly legislation into the tax deal			1
" creating a federal right to gamble that has never existed in our country 's history and imposing an unprecedented new tax regime on such activity require careful deliberation , not back - room deals or earmarks for special interests , " @entity11 reps			0
@entity66 of the @entity67 ; @entity68 of the @entity69 and @entity70 of the @entity71 wrote last week to @entity2 and @entity73 minority leader @entity72			0
between 2005 - 2010 @entity2 's campaign and his leadership political action committee received $ 224,450 from @entity76 and $ 113,450 from @entity77 , making them some of his largest contributors , according to the non-partisan @entity79 , which tracks the influence of money in politics			0
@entity76 and @entity77 did not respond to requests for comment			0
" it sure looks like payback , " a @entity11 congressional official told @entity1			0
according to a draft of the proposed measure obtained by @entity1 , large , established gambling companies would be the biggest winners if the legislation passed			0
it would legalize online poker basically only in @entity44 and @entity93			1
the draft bill says that online poker could be offered only by businesses that have 500 or more slot machines in the same building			1
that includes huge casinos in @entity44 and @entity93 and would make ineligible most @entity101 - land casinos and even long - standing poker places throughout @entity103 because they do n't have slot machines			1
seventy percent of the revenues from a new internet gambling trust fund would go to the states sponsoring the poker , presumably @entity44 and @entity93			1
only 30 % would go to any of the other states where the person playing is based			0
also the proposal includes new rules that would make it easier to bet on horse races			0
@entity11 congressional officials suspect that is an attempt to entice support from the senator from the biggest horse - racing state , @entity121 -- @entity72 .			0
