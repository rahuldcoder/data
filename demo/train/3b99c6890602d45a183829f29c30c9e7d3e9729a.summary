" i swear i did n't mean it , " pleads the man , who from his clothes and accent appears to be a migrant laborer , adding , " i swear to @entity22 i did n't know			2
" the abuser begins slapping his victim as he continues questioning him , demanding to know why the worker would dare contact his wife			2
officials are n't sure where it happened , but they 're looking into it			0
women who defied @entity2 driving ban fear repercussions the @entity2 government - backed @entity33 has condemned the video , telling @entity36 it launched an immediate investigation			1
" we are taking this very seriously and are looking into it with @entity2 security , " said the commission 's @entity38			2
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the accused abuser is arrested and tried			0
we are also doing everything we can to find the abused man , so that we can help him in any way			0
" @entity36 can not independently verify the authenticity of the video , but another @entity2 government - backed human rights group , the @entity50 , is also investigating			1

as awful as the incident captured on video is , it is not an isolated one			0
global human rights groups have documented widespread abuse of migrant workers in @entity2			1
according to @entity69 , there are " over nine million migrant workers in @entity2 -- more than half the work force			1
" in july , the rights group issued a statement saying that " many suffer multiple abuses and labor exploitation , sometimes amounting to slavery - like conditions			2
" the group added : " the kafala , or sponsorship , system ties migrant workers ' residency permits to ' sponsoring ' employers , whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country			1
employers often abuse this power in violation of @entity2 law to confiscate passports , withhold wages and force migrants to work against their will or on exploitative terms			2
" @entity69 @entity2 researcher @entity98 said that " @entity2 needs to get serious about protecting migrant workers by providing adequate avenues to justice and mechanisms of redress			1
" @entity2 preacher sentenced to 8 years , 600 lashes for killing 5 - year - old daughter the sponsorship system is n't limited to @entity2 -- migrant laborers throughout the @entity109 face similar problems			1
" nobody can come into the @entity115 states or in the @entity109 without a sponsor , " says @entity111 , with the @entity112			0
according to @entity111 , many migrant workers are asked to surrender their passports upon entering countries in the @entity109 , which can make them vulnerable to abuse			1
" when the employer has that kind of power , then they can dictate the working conditions , " explains @entity111			0
" whether it 's a question of the wage rates , whether it 's a question of the work time			0
" adds @entity111 , " what is lacking in the @entity109 and many of these countries is that the workers do n't have representation			0
" rights activists say it 's a huge problem that 's only getting worse -- this latest case being a prime example			2
toward the end of the video , the real brutality begins			0
" sit down ! kneel down ! " yells the @entity2 man , as he begins to flog the victim with a belt			1
standing above him , the @entity2 man also repeatedly slaps and kicks the worker			1
the screams of " no " are bloodcurdling			0
before the end of the nearly two - minute video , the @entity2 man asks the worker if he wants to die			1
many are asking if the beating went on and what happened to the victim afterward			0
apparently , like the fate of so many abused and forgotten foreign workers , for now , hardly anyone knows			0
