-- on wednesday , @entity2 officials announced a serious problem with the @entity5 satellite , the world 's most successful planet - finding machine			1
since its launch four years ago , @entity5 has found more than 2,700 possible planets orbiting stars other than our @entity12 , of which more than 100 have been confirmed			1
a few of these exoplanets resemble the @entity16 in size or mass. recently , three @entity16 - like planets were even reported to be in the habitable zone : close enough to the star they orbit that water is liquid , yet not so close that it is boiling			1
planets with liquid water may well harbor life			1
now , the second of four of the @entity5 spacecraft 's reaction wheels , which aim the vessel 's instruments , appears to have failed			1
it remains to be seen whether full repairs are possible			0
for the spacecraft to point accurately , at least three reaction wheels are needed , corresponding to the three dimensions ( up - down , north - south , east - west )			2
the fourth wheel serves as a backup and provides cross-comparisons of data among the wheels			0
the first wheel failed last summer ; now @entity5 has too few reaction wheels to keep pointing with sufficient stability			2
when a major component like a thruster fails on any spacecraft , operations software points the craft 's solar panels toward the sun to ensure a continuous power supply			0
power is a satellite 's lifeblood : lose it and you lose communications , so the satellite ca n't be oriented properly or take data			2
backup batteries allow the solar panels to be misdirected for a few hours or so , before all power is lost			0
but batteries drain quickly , so engineers design software to make sure that when something goes wrong , the spacecraft points in a direction that preserves power			0
@entity73 : three more homes for life in the universe ? reaction wheels are spinning flywheels that carry " angular momentum , " a term roughly analogous to the force that keeps a car coasting even when the driver 's foot is off the gas			1
spinning objects keep spinning unless they transfer angular momentum to another object			0
for example , if a flywheel is commanded to spin more slowly ( through an electric motor ) , the spacecraft will pick up spin to compensate			0
if the flywheel spins faster , the spacecraft will spin in the opposite direction			0
increasing or decreasing the spin of a reaction wheel is therefore a way of pointing the spacecraft			0
this may sound like a complicated way to make a telescope move , but the problem is , there is nothing in empty space to push on			0
to close a door , you push on it			0
this works because gravity holds you firmly on the ground , and your feet stay put because of friction with the floor			0
if you pushed on an open door in space , it would push you in the opposite direction			0
in space , there is no standing still			0
so @entity5 's reaction wheels are essential for pointing the spacecraft accurately and steadily			1
unfortunately , less stable pointing means less accurate photometry ( the measurement of light from the star )			0
since @entity5 finds planets by measuring the tiny dips in a star 's brightness when a dark planet moves across the face of that star , less accurate photometry means @entity16 - like planets will be too hard to find			1
@entity73 : a meteor and asteroid -- 1 in 100 million odds @entity2 is trying to figure how to fix or work around the broken reaction wheels			1
it has done amazing things before ; you do n't have to be an optimist to think there is still a chance to turn @entity5 around			2
but the loss of a fully functional @entity5 would be terrible			1
it has found more potential planets than any other facility or method			2
@entity5 data have yielded an estimate of the total number of @entity16 - like planets in the @entity157 galaxy : at least 17 billion			1
that 's an @entity16 - like planet around one in every six stars			1
fortunately , there are other ways to find planets than by detecting transits ( the passage of a planetary body across a sun ) , as @entity5 does			1
in fact , the first few hundred exoplanets were found by the " radial velocity " technique , which detects tiny motions of a star as it and its planets orbit one another			2
a @entity176 astronomy professor , @entity175 , has pioneered clever improvements to this technique so that she can find 100 @entity16 - size planets , perhaps 10 % of which might harbor life			1
( hear the full story in @entity175 's @entity183 talk , " why we need to find 100 earths			2
" ) @entity175 is going after @entity16 - like planets in the habitable zone			0
after all , the discovery of life on another planet would cause a profound shift in our world view , akin to the @entity194 shift from an @entity195 to a @entity12 - centric world			1
so when @entity175 says we should be " the alien civilizations that explore other worlds , " i say : with @entity5 or without , it 's only a matter of time until we find signs of life on other worlds			1
read more space and science news at @entity208 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity73 .			2

@entity2 says planet - finding @entity5 satellite directional *equipment* failing
@entity73 says @entity5 has found 2,700 - plus exoplanets , some that may harbor life
she says @entity2 's *resourceful* scientists working to fix it ; loss of its photometry would be huge
@entity73 : @entity176 prof has other method to find exoplanets ; we *'re* bound to eventually find signs of life
