the 5th @entity0 has stayed the execution of @entity4 death row inmate @entity2 , who was scheduled to be put to death at 6 p.m. wednesday , according to the court clerk 's office			1
@entity10 's case has sparked debate for years over whether the state can execute someone who is severely mentally ill. during his trial for the 1992 slayings of his mother - and father - in - law , @entity10 represented himself -- dressed in a purple cowboy outfit -- and called @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21 to the stand			1
the now - 56 - year - old was convicted of shooting them to death at close range , in front of his wife and daughter			1
@entity10 has suffered from schizophrenia for 30 years , his lawyers say , and he was hospitalized for mental illness numerous times before the murders			1
attorney asked governor for stay though @entity10 received initial evaluations of his mental health , his state of mind has deteriorated , his lawyer @entity38 said			1
she noted in a letter to gov. @entity43 that @entity10 has n't received a mental evaluation in seven years			1
@entity45 asked that @entity43 grant a 30 - day stay to the scheduled execution so that that an evaluation can be done to determine if he understands his punishment			2
it 's not just @entity10 's legal team that believes his execution would be a violation of the @entity55 's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment			0
mental health professionals and advocates , members of the @entity58 and representatives from the @entity60 have urged that he be spared			1
more than a dozen conservative leaders -- including a @entity65 opinion editor and a @entity67 biographer -- have also written to @entity43 , asking that @entity10 's execution be halted and his sentence be commuted to life in prison			0
" rather than serving as a measured response to murder , the execution of mr. @entity10 would only serve to undermine the public 's faith in a fair and moral justice system , " their letter reads			0
ex-wife : he should never have stood trial as a recent @entity85 opinion piece noted , @entity81 , @entity10 's ex-wife and the daughter of his victims , filed a petition stating that because of @entity10 's paranoid delusions when he committed the killings , he never should have faced trial			2
opinion : the atrocity of killing a mentally ill man " if he 's executed there should be a sense of outrage , " said @entity93 , legal director for the @entity94			1
" there 's no question he 's mentally ill. if this happens , the message would be -- ' we just do n't care			1
' " to execute him flies in the face of even supporters of the death penalty who say that it should be carried out with inmates who are the worst of the worst , " @entity93 continued			2
" it would be much more compassionate and practical to spend money treating inmates with mental illness rather than execute this man			2
" @entity114 denied the @entity115 voted 7 - 0 to deny clemency in @entity10 's case			2
there is still an appeal before the @entity121 @entity120 , in addition to the appeal the 5th @entity0 granted wednesday			0
@entity10 would be the 11th person @entity4 officials have executed in 2014			0
@entity126 psychiatry professor and @entity128 member dr. @entity125 said that he 's followed the case since 2007 , when the @entity121 @entity120 stopped @entity10 's execution and ruled that another competency review be performed			0
the 5th @entity0 found in 2013 that @entity10 was competent enough to be executed			0
lately , @entity121 society has been engaged in a conversation about mental illness and the role of the death penalty for inmates who are not of sound mind , @entity125 told @entity85			1
" we 've come to understand that there is no legitimate penal reason to put such a person to death , " he said			0
" it 's not likely to deter people from committing crimes and given @entity10 's impairment , it 's not a fitting punishment			0
