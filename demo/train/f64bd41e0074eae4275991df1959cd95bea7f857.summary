@entity0 -- the report into @entity3 17 says everything			1
and yet it says nothing about the cause of the plane 's crash and the criminals			1
it tells us that @entity13 was brought down by " high energy objects " which were of " external causes " and never once uses the word missile			1
how can this be ? the purpose of the preliminary report is not to apportion blame ; that is left to prosecutors and courts who deal with those who caused this atrocity			2
this investigation is all about finding out what happened and making sure it never happens again			0
once you understand that , reading the report makes sense			2
there is a great deal about how the plane got to be flying where it was , how engine oil was added in @entity36 airport before @entity13 flew into @entity37 and some thundershowers			1
the report details how the plane was flying legally , over eastern @entity37 and in unrestricted air space			1
that point is made again and again , lest anyone wants to suggest otherwise			0
the reports goes into the routine progression of the flight			2
how the pilots asked for a slight change of course to the left to avoid bad weather , then air traffic control re-directed them to avoid other planes in the area			1
indeed , the report makes clear that there were three other large commercial planes in the area , two 777s and an @entity60			2
@entity13 was the victim of the awfulness of being in the wrong place at the wrong time			1
hauntingly , when you read the transcript of the air traffic control communications , there were no warnings , no maydays , nothing			0
the plane just disintegrated after being hit by those " high energy objects			0
" it is left to the air traffic controller in @entity76 , who comments minutes after the incident , that it seemed as if the radar signature " started falling apart			0
" other air traffic controllers say " it 's disappeared			0
" i have read many air traffic accident reports			0
in this report they have to make clear that the so - called black box 's unique digital signature was correct for this aircraft			1
in other words , this was the right flight data recorder for that aircraft			0
the report made clear it had been neither switched nor tampered with			0
this report is stark because it shows just how normal everything was until the second when the " external causes " hit			2
there is no long discussion about performance of engines , as they start to go wrong , no analysis of pilots actions as complex avionics start to flash warnings			0
just the sad , awful fact that at 13:20 the plane was blasted out of the sky			0
and it never says the word missile			1

report into @entity13 's crash says everything -- but nothing about the criminals behind its downing
@entity1 's @entity128 asks how it can *explain* the incident without using the word missile
the report goes into great detail about the plane 's flight over @entity37 , the bad weather , and the black box
quest says the report shows the plane was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
