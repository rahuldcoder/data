-- ok , so you 've resolved to lose weight , travel more and organize your finances in 2014			2
that 's a good start			1
but what about your virtual self ? the dawn of a new year is also a good time for a digital makeover : a savvier , more disciplined approach to @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and other social platforms			1
given that 73 % of online @entity17 adults are active on social media , according to a new @entity20 survey , this could have a bigger impact on your life than cleaning out that overstuffed closet			1
may we present these seven resolutions -- suggestions , really -- for better social - media use in the new year			1
do n't post pictures of all your meals sure , the tuna tartare at that fancy restaurant sure looks pretty			2
but interrupting your dinner to instagram it is rude to your dining companions , not to mention obnoxious for other people sitting nearby who have to endure your camera flashes and " which filter looks better ? " questions			2
some restaurants have even witnessed food " photographers " climb atop their chairs to get a better camera angle			2
do n't be that person			2
try limiting your food pics to special items like a customized birthday cake or maybe that famous 2 - pound burger you must finish to earn a free t - shirt and your photo on the pub wall			2
think before you tweet ok , this one may seem obvious			2
but it 's amazing how many otherwise smart people blast out thoughts on @entity12 without pausing to consider the sheer stupidity of what they 're saying			1
in august , tv 's dr. @entity58 sparked a backlash after a tweet posted on his verified @entity12 account asked whether it 's ok to have sex with a drunk girl			1
the tweet was quickly deleted but not before the @entity66 erupted in outrage			2
then there was @entity69 , the @entity70 executive who posted this on @entity12 this month before boarding a flight to @entity73 : " going to @entity73			1
hope i do n't get @entity74			2
i 'm white ! " the tweet went viral while her plane was in the air , and she was fired soon after			0
it takes only a few seconds to compose a dumb tweet			0
the damage can last much longer			0
do n't tag people in unflattering photos hey , buddy ! i tagged you in this party pic ! yeah , i know your eyes are closed , your stomach is sticking out and your tongue is caressing a bottle of tequila , but it 's hilarious , right ! right ? no ? oops			0
ask permission before posting questionable photos of people online			1
it 's just common courtesy			0
fact - check first no , @entity100 did n't die in april in a car accident in @entity102			0
but you would n't know that right away from all the breathless posts on @entity11 and @entity12			1
then there are the fake @entity11 posts , offering cheap airfare or free @entity108 , that try to scam you with malicious links			1
social media can spread misinformation as fast as truths			1
unless you want your friends to stop trusting you , @entity115 is a good source for debunking these rumors			1
or you could just use common sense			0
remember that less can be more an artfully rendered @entity13 photo of your baby or cat or snowy backyard can be a beautiful thing			1
seven photos in an hour , not so much			0
the same can apply to rapid - fire tweeting or constant @entity11 updates			1
unless you 're live - blogging from a forest fire or the @entity132 , do n't overwhelm your friends ' feeds			0
go easy on the selfies yes , " selfie " is the word of the year for 2013			2
and selfies can be fun to look at when the person is 1			0
wearing a costume , 2			0
with a celebrity or 3			0
standing in front of the @entity144			0
preferably all three at once			0
but we do n't really need to see you in front of your bathroom mirror , making a duck face			0
by its nature , social media is already narcissistic enough			1
be your authentic self unless , maybe , you 're @entity153			0
there is now a whole corps of " social media experts " who will tell you " how to build your personal brand			1
the nature of networking has n't really changed -- it 's still about who you know , staying in touch and being willing to put yourself out there -- and no number of marketing gimmicks will change that			0
be someone you 'd enjoy talking to at a party			0
if you 're using social media only to collect likes and followers , you 're probably doing something wrong			1
but you still might want to hold off on those knee - jerk @entity12 rants or @entity180 of yourself naked			1
