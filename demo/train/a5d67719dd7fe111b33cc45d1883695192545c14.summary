-- it 's remarkable how strong the @entity3 specials continue to perform in the ratings , year after year			1
" a @entity11 " is not the most popular entry in the beloved animated franchise ( both " a @entity7 " and it 's the " @entity10 , @entity3 " deliver bigger numbers )			2
yet the program still managed to hold its own against @entity14 ' " @entity13 " and @entity16 's " the x-factor " ( in fact , the special edged out factor in total viewers , see below )			0
plus , " a @entity11 " delivered its biggest audience in four years â € ” 8.1 million viewers and a 2.2 rating in the adult demo , up 22 percent from last year			1
pretty spry for a 39 - year - old repeat , huh ? as for the rest of the programs last night , well ... only the most masochistic of tv showrunners and network executives even look at ratings during a holiday week ( which is to say , pretty much all of them )			2
everything slipped from last week , with @entity14 ' " csi " dropping the least ( only 8 percent ) and @entity37 's " @entity36 : @entity38 " falling the most ( down 24 percent )			0
