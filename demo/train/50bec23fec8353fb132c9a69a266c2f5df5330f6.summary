-- a child was killed friday because that child went to school			1
the shooting friday at a high school in @entity6 , @entity7 -- just miles from my home in @entity10 -- is a tragedy on two levels			1
first , most profoundly , two people are dead , four others wounded , and the parents , relatives , friends , teachers and classmates of the shooter and his victims have had their lives grievously changed			0
but this is not the first shooting in and around schools and colleges in @entity28 since the most infamous shooting at @entity30			2
( the exact numbers differ depending on how you count			0
) the other tragedy , then , is that gun violence -- in schools , in workplaces and across our communities -- has become virtually normal in @entity28			1
it is not normal , in a civilized nation , to have over 30,000 gun deaths a year			2
it is not normal , in a civilized nation , to expect educators and parents and first responders to have plans at the ready for a shooting at their school			2
it is not normal , in a civilized nation , to assert that the best solution to gun violence is for more people to have more access to more guns			1
so the question we must confront is : are we a civilized nation ? earlier this week , i listened to a @entity65 correspondent open a report on the shootings in @entity68 , @entity69 , by saying : " in a scene reminiscent of @entity28 ...			1
" that is not the kind of exceptionalism @entity28 should be proud of			1
though the @entity76 crisis makes us rightly careful about using the word " epidemic , " it is no overstatement to say that the @entity28 has been in a years - long epidemic of gun violence			1
the sheer volume of homicides , accidental killings , suicides and merely disabling injuries is staggering			0
the number , both in absolute and per capita terms , exceeds by many times that of any other developed country on @entity92			0
what also makes this an epidemic is that it is contagious			1
the more it spreads , the more it spreads			0
the more that a minority of citizens block prevention and treatment , the less effective prevention and treatment become for all			0
to put it bluntly , gun violence is orders of magnitude more deadly to @entity28 than @entity76			1
so , what do we do about the public health crisis of gun violence ? we have to turn to both law and norms			2
many gun - rights absolutists respond to the death and mayhem of a @entity6 or a @entity30 by saying that a particular gun law -- say , background checks for gun purchases -- would n't have prevented that tragedy			1
but when someone driving under the speed limit dies in a car wreck , we do n't throw out speed limits and declare them an ineffective burden			0
we recognize that speed limits and seat belt laws are part of a grown - up system of rules that reduce the overall likelihood of traffic fatalities			0
in precisely the same way , a requirement of background checks for gun purchases reduces the overall likelihood that people will die of gun violence			1
that 's why in the state of @entity7 , i 've been working with other citizens to secure passage of a ballot initiative that will create such background checks			1
and it 's why that measure seems to most people here not like tyranny but like common sense			2
the challenge extends beyond lawmaking to norm - setting			0
the coalition of parents , faith leaders , educators , businesspeople and others in @entity7 who are uniting behind background checks do so in the name of a core social norm : responsibility			1
all our @entity28 rights -- and particularly @entity169 rights -- come with responsibilities			2
the responsibility , for instance , to minimize the danger inherently created by the circulation of weapons that can kill en masse			0
the responsibility to foster a culture of safety , especially for our youth			0
when middle - aged " open - carry " activists walk into @entity183 with semi-automatic rifles slung over their shoulders , they are n't exercising their rights with an ethic of responsibility			1
they 're trying to intimidate their way to respect and esteem			0
they 're acting out , demanding attention and rejecting curbs on their desires			0
that 's not being a citizen			0
it 's being a toddler			0
we the people get to decide whether that 's normal			1
whether it 's acceptable or laughable to brandish firearms in the produce aisle			0
whether it 's tolerable or disgraceful that we average more than one school shooting a week now			2
laws like background checks can help set a tone for what 's ok			1
but ultimately , with our family and friends and neighbors , each one of us must decide what kind of civilization we expect in the @entity28			2
somebody 's child was killed friday because that child went to school			1
somebody has to do something about it			0
in ways full of both risk and responsibility , you are that somebody .			0

@entity227 : a child was killed because he went to school in @entity6 , @entity7 , today
**liu** : steady stream of shootings makes them virtually normal . is this " @entity28 exceptionalism " ?
it 's contagious epidemic . gun activists *wrongly* say background checks wo n't help , he says
**liu** : we the people must set tone , standards , with laws , norms . it 's our responsibility
