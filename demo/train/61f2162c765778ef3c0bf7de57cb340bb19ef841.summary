@entity0 , @entity1 -- when 23 - year - old magazine editor @entity4 looked to make his first investment in 2012 , he considered the stock market			1
many @entity8 investors have jumped on the skyrocketing property market , but it was too rich for @entity4 's blood			1
instead he decided to invest in bitcoin			0
" i believed in bitcoin as a more secure way to store the value than renminbi , " @entity4 said , referring to @entity1 's currency			1
" i trusted in its mechanisms			0
" @entity4 's trust paid off -- he purchased bitcoin when it was trading at 60 yuan ( u.s. $ 9.85 ) on the @entity8 market and sold when it was trading at 700 yuan ( $ 115 ) in june			1
last week , bitcoin was trading at 7,000 yuan ( $ 1,149 )			2
with bitcoin now reaching prices equivalent to an ounce of gold , more investors are turning toward the digital currency for a return on investment			2
and @entity8 investors seeking similar investment success like @entity4 are feeding the bitcoin frenzy			1
more than a third of the world 's bitcoin transactions now flow through @entity1 's largest bitcoin trading website @entity1 , according to bitcoin data websites			1
@entity1 has surpassed @entity39 's @entity38 and @entity41 's @entity40 , reaching 100,000 @entity42 in daily trading volumes , or more than 400 million yuan ( @entity44 $ 65.7 million ) in daily transactions			1
infographic : what is bitcoin ? " we think it 's because @entity42 presents itself as a new asset class , albeit digital in nature			1
and given @entity1 is a country with strong practice of savings , " @entity52 , ceo and co-founder of @entity1 , told @entity2			2
" it is quite understandable that the @entity8 would want to explore bitcoins as yet another potential asset class for investing some of their savings			2
" in recent years @entity1 has been pushing to internationalize the yuan , adding more value to the once tightly controlled currency on international markets			2
but despite the changes , controls mean individuals still find it difficult to invest in assets outside @entity1			2
as a result , more @entity8 are looking to invest in alternative assets like bitcoin			1
trading in the digital currency has been extremely volatile			0
early in november the currency rose to what was then an all - time high of $ 900 earlier , only to fall back to $ 500 in the span of 28 hours			0
by last friday , it was trading as high as $ 1,242			0
bitcoin worth almost as much as gold " @entity8 interest could play a huge role in turning bitcoin into the first trillion dollar non-fiat currency , " @entity80 -- founding director of @entity81 and the @entity82 , an asset - backed internet reserve currency -- recently wrote in a @entity85 opinion piece			1
" ironically , it is the @entity91 , the ' free market ' financial heavyweight in the world , that finds itself moving slowly to figure out how to adopt bitcoin , " he wrote			2
" meanwhile , @entity1 is proving to be a leading player in this 21st century currency			0
" however , digital currencies are not officially recognized as legitimate in @entity1			0
in 2009 , the government restricted the use of @entity102 coin , a popular virtual currency created by tech tycoon @entity104 , to only virtual products			0
now @entity42 faces a similar move			0
@entity1 's central bank warned late on thursday that @entity42 carries substantial risks and issued new rules to prohibit financial institutions from dealing in the digital currency			1
@entity113 : @entity42 could ' destroy the dollar ' under the new regulation , financial institutions in @entity1 are banned from trading , underwriting or offering insurance in bitcoin			1
in addition , websites in @entity1 that provide trading services are required to report investors ' identities to regulators and take steps to prohibit money laundering			1
following the central bank 's announcement , the bitcoin price on the @entity8 market shrunk by more than 20 % and is still in decline			1
while the central bank did not outlaw or prohibit individuals from owning bitcoin , the guidelines specify that it is not to be considered a currency			0
with his past gains , @entity4 is happy to besitting out the current bitcoin boom and bust			0
" the ongoing trend is nothing more than a hype to attract geeks , " he said			0
" it 's still very hard to spend			0
and i 'm not investing more in bitcoin until i can use it to buy things from @entity151 and @entity152			0
" " these are speculators that do n't have faith in @entity42 's value			2
they 'll bailout from the market immediately after they suffer a deficit , " he added .			0
