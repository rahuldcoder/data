-- i have the utmost respect for dr. @entity3 and @entity4			1
dr. @entity3 , an academic philosopher at @entity8 , has for decades spoken up for the poor			1
@entity4 , talk show host and author , has always used his platform to discuss the issues of the black community and the country as a whole			1
president @entity17 said during the 2008 campaign that we should be able to disagree without being disagreeable			1
that is a simple injunction that many in politics do not follow			0
that said , i respectfully disagree with @entity3 and @entity4 's characterization of president @entity17 's first term in office			1
@entity3 has simply described it as a failure , and referred to the president as " the black mascot of @entity34 oligarchs , " and the " head of the @entity37 killing machine			1
" @entity4 has accused the president of ignoring the issues of the black community			1
the two held a 16 - city " @entity43 " earlier this month , during which they aired their complaints about @entity17			1
to hear them tell it , one would think that @entity17 is in the back pocket of @entity34 and the banks and has turned his back on the working poor , impoverished and middle class in @entity37			1
i am not looking at president @entity17 's first term through rose colored glasses			1
there is always room for criticism and improvement ; our president 's decisions are far from perfect			2
but the criticism from @entity60 and @entity4 leave out a lot			2
they ignore the positive moves @entity17 has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community , the poor , the disadvantaged , and the country as a whole			1
let 's take @entity17 and health care reform			1
under the @entity71 , which he shepherded and signed into law , insurance companies are no longer allowed to deny insurance to individuals because of pre-existing conditions			0
children can now remain covered by their parents ' insurance until age 26			0
no longer will there be kids fresh out of college starting in entry level positions walking around with no health insurance			0
the prescription drug cost for @entity89 recipients was cut by 50 %			0
more than 30 million people who did not have access to coverage will now have that access			0
this legislation is not perfect -- it lacks the public option many had hoped for -- but it is the largest federal reform in a lifetime , a tremendous accomplishment			0
then there is the @entity99 , signed into law by @entity17 , which provides health care to millions of kids			2
let 's talk @entity17 and education			1
president @entity17 signed @entity105 , which invests $ 5 billion in early childhood programs like @entity107			1
studies show such programs help kids stay in school longer , earn more money in the long term and have lower involvement in crime			0
president @entity17 also expanded @entity116 , which help low income students pay for college			1
he has done what no other president had done before by enacting the student aid and @entity122 , which makes college more affordable while ending federal subsidies to private lenders and replacing them with a @entity127 program			2
this is a direct contradiction of @entity60 's claims that the president has " sold out " to the big banks			2
the banks lost billions on this act ; in taking them out of the equation , students are no longer held hostage to credit markets			0
somehow , these accomplishments , which have a direct impact on the poor are not mentioned in @entity60 's and @entity4 's critique			1
@entity17 signed the @entity142 , restoring basic protections against pay discrimination through the @entity145 , signed in march , 2010 , @entity17 gave $ 18 billion in tax breaks for small businesses			2
he signed a bill extending unemployment insurance			0
to review , then : putting money into community colleges , job readiness programs , putting actual checks into actual hands -- these things do n't sound like the actions of someone who does n't care about the poor and impoverished			0
there is a very real crisis in this country			0
according to the @entity162 , about 45 million @entity37 live in poverty			0
such statistics are , as rep. @entity166 has said , " unconscionable			0
" president @entity17 has been demonstrating that he knows this			1
so why make someone like him your enemy when you are fighting on the same side ? if @entity3 and @entity4 would like @entity17 to do more , that 's valid			1
if they feel , like rep. @entity175 , that " people need to know that the president feels their pain , " that too is understandable			0
but the facts simply do n't support the accusation that @entity17 holds a laissez - faire attitude toward economically marginalized @entity37			2
he has faced huge partisan resistance			0
his campaign adviser , @entity184 , says @entity17 will soon announce a jobs plan that is expected to include an extension of payroll tax cuts , new revenue for transportation projects and an extension of emergency unemployment benefits			2
he notes that there 's nothing in the proposal " that reasonable people should n't be able to agree on , " yet many @entity195 are already preparing to reject whatever the president puts on the table			2
are they trying to stymie job creation initiatives , and then blame the president for high unemployment when the election rolls around ? i 'm not saying that president @entity17 should be exempt from criticism , nor do i believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions			1
but @entity3 and @entity4 have a responsibility to present a fair and complete picture , not a skewed version			1
could their slanted criticism result in so many of the working poor and impoverished working class becoming so discouraged that they stay home on election day in 2012 ? if they think they have issues with the president not doing enough for the poor now , wait and see what happens if the opposition takes office			2
then they would really need a poverty tour			0
we must not forget the mess that president @entity17 walked into			1
@entity17 said in his victory speech , " even as we celebrate tonight we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime			0
... the road ahead will be long			0
our climb will be steep			0
we may not get there in one year , or even one term			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			0

@entity3 , @entity4 critical of @entity17 's first term
@entity244 rejects view that @entity17 has failed
he says president has directed aid to those in need
@entity244 : if @entity17 loses , the poor will get much less help
