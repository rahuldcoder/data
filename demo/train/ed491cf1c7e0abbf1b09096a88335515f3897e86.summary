@entity0 -- more than 1,000 @entity3 troops have now been killed in @entity4 , according to @entity1 calculations			1
the @entity3 passed that grim milestone tuesday , when an improvised explosive device killed two of its troops in southern @entity4 , bringing the total to 1,001			1
the death toll does not include those killed in support of @entity14 in other countries			1
but the large number of casualties is in sharp contrast to the rates from another recent war			2
the deaths of these service members come 104 months since the start of the war in @entity4 , compared with the war in @entity26 , where more than 1,000 @entity3 troops were killed in the first 18 months of fighting			1
but @entity4 is getting deadlier by the day			2
from 2001 through 2006 , the @entity3 casualty rate never reached 100 in any single year			0
but that number started going up in 2007 and spiked to more than 300 last year			0
if the current rate continues , 2010 will be the deadliest year of the war , nearly a decade after it started			0
the milestone comes just 24 hours after the single deadliest day for coalition forces in @entity4 this year			1
insurgents killed 12 @entity37 soldiers on monday , seven of them @entity3			0
officials with the @entity39 say it was no single event but six separate attacks in southern and eastern @entity4			1
it was the most fatalities among @entity37 troops in a single day since october 26 , when 11 @entity3 were killed in two helicopter crashes			0
coalition forces are working to secure @entity47 and establish a legitimate government there and are launching an offensive to target up to 1,000 @entity52 fighters in @entity53			1
" we all expect the fight to get tougher as we carry out the new campaign , " defense secretary @entity54 said			0
added chairman of the @entity59 adm. @entity60 , " i think we 've been very clear for months now that this was going to be a very difficult fight in the south			0
and the expectations , try to set expectations ... as tragic as it is , for these losses			0
" a defense official says that @entity3 troops and their allies are tightening security around the city of @entity53 but that the operation there will take months and will not resemble a typical battle			2
more than a million @entity4 live in @entity53 , and the @entity52 are embedded in the population			1
the official says the goal will be weeding out the @entity52 , as well as the drug gangs and warlords that control much of the area 's economy .			2

death toll at 1,001 after explosion in southern @entity4
but fatalities have come *slower* than in @entity26 war
coalition forces working to secure @entity47
