-- a burger grown in a laboratory			2
sounds like science - fiction ? well up until very recently it probably was but now the prospect of lab - grown meat appearing on our supermarket shelves is closer than ever			1
synthetic or test - tube meat involves taking a small amount of cells from a living animal and growing it into lumps of muscle tissue in the lab , which can then , in theory , be eaten as meat for human consumption			1
as well avoiding killing animals , scientists believe it could help reduce the environmental impact of meat production			2
the technology to create artificial meat has been around since the turn of the century -- @entity28 once looked into developing it for their astronauts -- but making an edible and commercially viable product has remained out of reach			2
it also remains to be seen whether consumers will accept it as an alternative to farm animal - based meat			2
but now a @entity39 scientist says he is closer than ever to achieving the technological breakthrough			1
what 's more , he believes a market for his lab - grown meat does exist			1
@entity46 - born @entity45 , of the @entity47 , is a specialist in tissue engineering , working to create replacement tissue and organs for humans			1
he realized the same technology could be used to engineer meat for human consumption			0
he became the first scientist in the @entity39 to produce and publicly eat some of his tissue - engineered meat , at the 2011 @entity59 conference			1
his company , @entity60 , has already attracted a number of investors since being launched in 2011 , including , says @entity45 , funding from the @entity39 @entity63			1
see also : @entity64 initially at least , his engineered meat is likely to be more of a " niche " product , priced somewhere close to @entity67 beef , which is currently around $ 125 - $ 395 a kilo			1
" this product is n't going to be for the masses at the beginning , it 's going to be for eco-conscious people and people who do n't eat meat for ethical reasons , " says @entity45			1
however , @entity78 is not the only scientist working on lab - grown meat			1
@entity85 researchers , led by professor @entity82 of @entity83 , are promising a high - profile launch for their synthetic hamburger by the end of the year			0
" it 's not going to be as easy as some people imagine , " says @entity45 , and adds , " i am not racing him ( @entity82 )			2
" in fact , rather than attempt to race to produce an engineered meat product , @entity45 said his first lab - grown product is going to be leather , which he says " is a similar product to some extents but not as controversial and does n't require the same legislation that meat does "			1
when it comes to producing meat , @entity45 says the most difficult part is creating muscle tissue that tastes , looks and feels like animal flesh			1
" what the final outcome is going to be is difficult to predict , " says @entity45			2
" one thought is that it 'll be something like an ingredient to a lot of staples which are based on animal protein -- for example we make something which has the consistency of ground meat and that can be used for @entity118 © , meatballs			2
" take the analogy of flour			0
you do n't eat flour , it 's not very tasty but you eat a zillion products that contain flour and are very yummy			0
whether or not this is going to be a major application of our product i do n't know but this is definitely something i envisage it leading to			0
" see also : ' @entity134 ' to protect phones from prying ears @entity45 says lab - grown meat is becoming increasingly necessary as the world struggles to cope with an unsustainable meat industry			1
as well as animal welfare concerns over rearing large numbers of farm animals in close proximity , the water use , farmland for animal feed , waste and greenhouse - gas emissions associated with meat production make it one of the most significant environmental problems in the world today			1
the @entity153 estimated that 18 % of global greenhouse emissions are accounted for by the livestock sector , and demand for meat is predicted to double over the next 40 years			0
research from the @entity159 , published last year , estimated that lab - grown meat produces 78 - 96 % lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventionally produced meat within the @entity162			1
it also had a 99 % lower land use and a 82 - 96 % lower water use			0
" the rules of the game of meat production are not the same as they were 100 years ago , " says @entity45			2
" it 's not sustainable			0
we are destroying this planet with intensive meat production			0
seventy percent of arable land today is one way or another connected to animals through grazing animals or growing food for them			0
we 're running out of it			0
" he adds : " what we 're doing is a transformational idea			0
we 're going to produce something that is not exactly the same but it is going to be cost efficient and much less harmful to the environment			0
" what still remains uncertain is whether or not consumers will accept a lab - grown meat product			1
@entity189 , a sociologist from the @entity190 at @entity192 's @entity191 , has been studying the emergence of lab - grown meat and has interviewed a number of researchers working on the technology			1
" is this stuff really meat or something else ? " says @entity189			0
" some want it to be meat , and recognized like any other meat			0
others think it is better to be seen as a new type of meat and as such ok to taste or look different			0
then there is a minority who feel it is a meat substitute , very meat - like but not meat			2
" without a product available for people to see , smell and taste , @entity189 says it is difficult for any debate about how to classify it to move forward			0
" if it ever becomes a marketable product it will still be a small one			0
it is not going to be plumped in the supermarket			0
it will take time to gain acceptability , " says @entity189			0
many of the scientists working on lab - grown meat still see their research as marginal and are striving to get synthetic meat accepted as a reality , according to @entity189			1
whatever the final outcome , lab - grown meat is no longer in the realm of science fiction			1
there is no question that someone will hit it big and if we are the ones then so much the better , " says @entity45 .			2

@entity39 scientist says he is close to creating commercially available meat in a laboratory
@entity45 is taking cells from a living animal and growing them into muscle tissue
his first lab - grown product is going to be leather
some *experts* question if there is a market for lab - grown meat
