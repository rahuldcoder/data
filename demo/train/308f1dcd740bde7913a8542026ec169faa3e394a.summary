the first human trial of an experimental @entity2 vaccine has produced promising results , @entity5 scientists said , raising hopes that protection from the deadly disease may be on the horizon			1
all 20 healthy adults who received the vaccine in a trial run by researchers from the @entity10 in @entity15 produced an immune response and developed @entity18 antibodies , the @entity10 said wednesday			1
none suffered serious side effects , although two people developed a brief fever within a day of vaccination			1
the vaccine is being developed by the @entity10 's @entity25 and @entity27 pharmaceutical giant @entity26			1
the process has been fast - tracked in light of the current catastrophic @entity2 outbreak in @entity31 , which has claimed more than 5,000 lives			2
" based on these positive results from the first human trial of this candidate vaccine , we are continuing our accelerated plan for larger trials to determine if the vaccine is efficacious in preventing @entity2 infection , " said @entity33 , director of the @entity25			1
in this trial , genetic material from two strains of the ebola virus , @entity45 and @entity46 , was delivered using a chimpanzee cold virus that does not harm humans			1
the vaccine does not contain the ebola virus and can not cause a person to be infected with @entity2 , the @entity10 said			1
the current outbreak involves the @entity46 strain			0
blood tested the adults , volunteers ages 18 to 50 , were split into two groups			2
@entity60 received an intramuscular injection of vaccine at a lower dose and 10 received the same vaccine at a higher dose , the @entity10 said			2
researchers tested the volunteers ' blood at two weeks and four weeks after vaccination to determine if @entity71 antibodies had been produced			2
all 20 volunteers developed such antibodies within four weeks of receiving the vaccine , with levels higher in those who were given the higher - dose vaccine			1
the researchers also looked to see if the vaccine prompted production of immune system cells called t cells , after a previous study on primates using the same vaccine suggested they may also help to protect from the disease			0
they found that many of the volunteers did produce t cells , including @entity87 t cells , which may play a crucial role in protecting against infection by @entity2 viruses			1
four weeks after vaccination , the @entity92 cells were found in two volunteers who received the lower - dose vaccine and in seven who had the higher dose , the @entity10 said			1
the two volunteers who briefly developed a fever had received the higher - dose vaccine			2
unanswered questions professor @entity101 , a leading virologist at @entity27 's @entity102 , told @entity103 that the trial was an " essential first step " toward a vaccine to prevent @entity2 and justifies some optimism			1
however , there are still some unanswered questions , he said			0
" we know from some of the preliminary work that went on in animal studies previously that the antibodies that are generated in response to the vaccine do n't last as long as we would like -- there was a clear reduction over a fairly long period of time , about 10 months , " he said			2
" so it 's possible that that might be a problem in humans , but the reality is we wo n't know until it 's actually been tested in humans			0
" we can hope that it will provide a longer - term protection			0
if it does n't , at least it gives us some level of protection over a window , which could be enormously valuable in protecting people from outbreaks at the time the outbreaks occur			0
" other approaches are being looked at too , he said , and will also benefit from the @entity137 's decision this summer to allow some processes to be fast - tracked			0
who : @entity141 cases may be increasing if further clinical trials result in an effective vaccine , health care workers on the front line of the fight against @entity2 are likely to be the first to receive it			1
the virus has already taken a heavy toll on those caring for @entity2 patients , with 592 health care workers known to have been infected , including 340 who have died , according to @entity137			2
in total , 5,689 people have died from the ebola virus , as of november 23 , the @entity137 said in an update wednesday			0
there have been 15,935 cases in eight countries since the outbreak began , but @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity141 remain by far the worst affected countries			0
they reported 600 new cases in the week ending sunday , with 385 of those in @entity141			0
" case incidence is stable in @entity163 , stable or declining in @entity162 , but may still be increasing in @entity141 , " the @entity137 said			0
the @entity137 update also warned that cases and deaths continue to be under - reported in this outbreak			0
@entity162 , @entity163 and @entity141 have between them recorded 15,901 cases and 5,674 deaths attributed to the virus since the beginning of the outbreak .			0

a virologist says the trial is an essential first step and justifies some optimism
all 20 volunteers in the first clinical trial of the vaccine produced @entity18 antibodies
none of the volunteers suffered serious side effects , the @entity10 says
the vaccine carries genetic material from the virus , but there 's no risk of @entity2 infection
