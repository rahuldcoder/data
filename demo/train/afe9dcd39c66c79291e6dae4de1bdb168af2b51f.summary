-- @entity1 remembers when his hometown of @entity3 , @entity4 , had no commercial airport			1
now , he ca n't imagine life without it			0
more than a half - century ago , @entity1 boarded a @entity9 bus for the 300 - mile trip to @entity11 where he enlisted in @entity14 boot camp amid the @entity15			0
two years later , he returned home to @entity4 and a bus brought him back to @entity3 , safe and sound			1
but @entity9 does n't service @entity3 anymore			0
so @entity1 , now an 81 - year - old retired widower , relies on a @entity23 flight from the @entity3 airport to the @entity11 , where he receives medical treatment for his eye condition			1
when he ca n't make the flight , he shares a @entity29 van with several other travelers willing to endure the six - hour drive			0
@entity1 would drive himself -- if it were n't for his eye condition -- which he says is similar to macular degeneration			0
it restricts his driving to daytime only -- on non-interstate roads			0
" if nobody else is scheduled to take the van , then i have to fly , " @entity1 says			0
" if we did n't have a flight out of here that i could take , i do n't know what i 'd do			0
we 're kind of stranded up here			0
" @entity1 's situation could get a lot worse			1
a @entity46 bill proposes virtually killing a subsidy program that helps 162 small rural airports , like the one in @entity3 , stay in business			1
airports in @entity51 and @entity52 would be spared			1
subsidized airport locations and amounts it 's a threat that could leave @entity1 and other travelers who rely on tiny local airports with frighteningly few travel options			1
without the program -- which is called @entity60 , @entity3 would change radically , say community leaders			0
commercial airlines would pull out , they say , leaving the airport with nothing but income from private aircraft and charter flights			1
the airport ferries business travelers for a local paper mill as well as hunters and other outdoor sports enthusiasts			1
over the long term , officials say , the airport infrastructure would suffer due to the loss of funding			1
not only would those travelers be left with few options , the economic effects on the town , they say , would be staggering			1
" it would be incredibly difficult , probably impossible , to find another carrier to come here without an @entity60 contract , unless the economy surges astoundingly and fuel prices simultaneously decline , " says @entity83 , executive secretary of the airport commission			1
falling numbers , crucial connections @entity3 ' airport started getting the @entity60 subsidies in 2009			1
" for many , many years we never needed it , " says airport commission chairman @entity94 , until the nation 's economic crisis took its toll			1
in the last two to three years the facility 's annual commercial airline traffic has plunged from about 25,000 departures and 25,000 arrivals , to recent figures of 13,000 or 14,000 each way , @entity94 says			2
" but we 're seeing those numbers starting to increase			0
" a recent price for the least expensive round - trip ticket from @entity3 to @entity11 was more than $ 450 , says @entity109 , @entity11 - area branch manager of @entity110			0
" we have a lot of people who come down from @entity3 to @entity11 and shop -- they go to @entity114 -- and we have a lot of people who visit their family , " @entity109 said			0
" and if they 're going to stay awhile , they might drive down so they can have their cars , but for weekend trips -- yes they want to fly			0
" vacationers from @entity3 and @entity4 's other small towns also rely on their local airports to ferry them hundreds of miles to @entity11 where they must make crucial airline connections in their itineraries			1
@entity60 is projected to pay more than $ 1.3 million in subsidies this fiscal year to @entity23 for its @entity3 service			2
that works out to a subsidy of about $ 49.79 per passenger , according to the @entity136			0
now @entity23 is looking to pull its service from the community			0
under @entity60 , airlines ca n't pull out of an airport until a replacement carrier agrees to fill the gap			2
negotiations are now ongoing with @entity144 to have that airline replace @entity23 , @entity94 says			0
is it obsolete ? @entity60 opponents point to news reports out of @entity149 , @entity150 , describing outrage over last year 's sky - high average per passenger subsidy of $ 3,720			2
the @entity60 program began in 1978 as a temporary way to help small airports survive federal deregulation			1
rep. @entity159 , chairman of the @entity46 aviation subcommittee , says the program is obsolete			1
" why should the government have to pay for all this ? " asks @entity159 , a @entity163 @entity162			0
being from a big state , @entity159 is very aware that small airports are important to rural voters			1
what does he tell them when they complain about his plan to cut subsidies ? " up in northern @entity163 , a number of people were n't happy about this sort of thing , " he admits			2
" i say well ... my part of the state , @entity179 , had air service and it was canceled numerous times and each time it was canceled people got together and started a new airline themselves			0
it 's not that hard			2
you just need a pilot and a small plane			2
" @entity159 suggests that these airports join a federal small communities program which provides grants to help start new air service			1
supporters say taxpayers should n't have a problem with @entity60 because much of the fund does n't come from taxpayer dollars			0
according to the @entity136 , $ 50 million of the fund 's $ 193 million is paid for by foreign airlines through fees they pay to fly over the @entity200			2
if @entity60 dies , says @entity159 , that money will continue to be collected and could possibly go toward many other goals , including deficit reduction and speeding up implementation of @entity205 -- the @entity207 's massive overhaul of the nation 's air traffic system			1
@entity159 says it 's time for small airport operators to put free enterprise in the driver 's seat			1
for @entity1 , getting in the driver 's seat for a holiday visit to see his three daughters and grandchildren is not an option			2
his eyesight has failed him and now , he fears the airlines and @entity222 might fail him too			0
" i favor it more than other kinds of government subsidies , " says @entity1			2
" it 's more important than subsidizing oil companies			2
" @entity46 and @entity228 negotiators are hammering out a compromise bill this month			1
@entity159 says they 're " very close " to an agreement			0
but it 's unclear if the @entity60 program will survive			2
if so , full @entity46 and the @entity228 votes on a final bill are expected sometime in january			1
some might suggest that @entity1 consider moving closer to his doctor and family in @entity11			0
but after living in @entity3 nearly his entire life -- working at the local paper mill and raising his three daughters -- he says that 's just not going to happen			0
" it 's a small town and it 's so easy to get around and it has such friendly people			1
i do n't know if i could ever relocate			0
