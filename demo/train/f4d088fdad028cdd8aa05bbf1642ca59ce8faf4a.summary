@entity0 , @entity1 -- the man accused of shooting into a packed movie theater made his first court appearance monday , giving the public its first look at the 24 - year - old former doctoral student since his arrest moments after the gunfire ended early friday			1
@entity11 , his hair dyed various shades of orange , looked down , then straight ahead			1
he sat without blinking for long periods			1
at times , his eyes fluttered , then squeezed tight and reopened in a blank stare			1
occasionally , his eyebrows arched over several days of stubble , giving his face a mournful mien			1
but the dazed - looking man , who identified himself to police as " @entity25 , " wore a maroon jumpsuit over a white t - shirt and gave little indication that he was paying attention to the courtroom procedure that ensured he will continue to be held without bond			1

" he described @entity11 as a coward and a genius			1
" i do n't believe for a second that he 's sitting there with his wide eyes and pretending to be incoherent , " @entity63 said			2

" ' you could feel the anger in the room ' " the charges on which the court found cause included first - degree murder , " @entity37 district attorney @entity84 told reporters outside the courthouse			2
