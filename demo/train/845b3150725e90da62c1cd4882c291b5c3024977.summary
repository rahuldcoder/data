-- on a soundstage in @entity2 , @entity3 , 34 , has just finished filming a scene for her new @entity6 show , " @entity7			1
" we sit on a couch on set , a well - thumbed script beside her			1
still in an olive gown and full makeup , she 's ready for her next scene -- oh , except for the pair of white nikes on her feet			1
it 's a perfect illustration of how this working mom ( of 2 - year - old @entity23 ) and wife ( of nine years , to @entity25 ) manages both sides of her life			1
much like the twins she plays on tv , she has twin personas : " i 'm @entity3 when i 'm at work , " she says , " and i 'm @entity33 when i 'm not			1
" as the crew sets up the next shot , @entity3 talks about her healthy food obsession , why she naps during lunch , and the " weekends off " rule she credits for keeping her happy			1
q : how do you think growing up in @entity41 affected who you are today ? i think , automatically , you look at the world differently if you 're from a big city			2
you 're never bored , you do n't stay home , you 're always on your feet			1
i think it generates type a personalities			2
@entity0 : the hottest ways @entity51 lives healthy q : what are your favorite workouts ? i like anything outdoors			1
but i 'm just as happy on a treadmill			2
i grew up with [ stretches her back ] , and i still have , major scoliosis			2
growing up in @entity62 , you had your schoolbag , but we were so trend - conscious , nobody wanted to put a backpack on both shoulders , so almost all the girls i grew up with have it to some degree , because we all were so lopsided			2
so pilates not only is a great exercise , but does relieve a lot of discomfort			1
q : how did you keep fit when you were pregnant ? well , i went into labor at the @entity57 gym			2
q : you did n't ! and it was funny , too , because i was getting cranky , and i said to my trainer , " i 'm just cranky today			1
" she was like , " maybe it 's because you 're going to give birth ! " and i was like , " nah , not yet			2
" it turned out i was in labor , i did n't realize			1
@entity0 : @entity57 -- the secret to an amazing body q : have you changed your workout since you started @entity7 ? @entity91 , ha , um , if you count walking from @entity90 to stage 16 ! no. if anything , it 's downgraded			1
and i made sure that my body was strong before we started , because these hours are really difficult			1
q : do you have a go - to way to lose five pounds ? i do n't believe in trying to trick your body into things			1
i eat healthy , i exercise , i love food -- but i do n't like junk food			1
i mean , we 're women			2
we go up by five pounds , we lose it , depending on the water , the moon , your cycle , whatever			2
so i just try to maintain			2
q : you seem so confident			2
do you ever have moments of insecurity ? oh @entity113 ... i 'm a female ! [ @entity114			2
] i totally have body dysmorphic disorder			1
i think most women do			2
a makeup artist friend once said , " i do n't think i 've ever seen you look in a mirror			1
" i 'm surrounded by them all the time -- you sit in hair and makeup -- so i guess i just have this mechanism where i tune it out			2
so every once in a while , i 'll look and i 'll be like , " wait , that 's what i look like ? " i just have to remember that i 'm human , and i 'm a mom			2
being a parent changes the vanity at least a little bit			2
@entity0 : 8 ways to fall in lust with your body q : if you were ever to put a famous woman 's body on your fridge for inspiration , whose would it be ? i would never do that to myself , especially because i 'm aware of the airbrushing and trainers and food programs			1
you have to use yourself as inspiration			2
i think if i were ever going to put something up , i would put a picture of myself where i was proud of my body			1
but i would rather not look at a picture of myself on my fridge			2
in fact , we have a nonmagnetic fridge			0
q : what picture would it be ? probably before i got pregnant -- i was in really , really good shape			0
i think when i was doing buffy i was a little bit thin , actually , because even though i was working out constantly , it was just the time and the age			0
but i was happy being pregnant , too			0
i 'm not as critical as i used to be about my body			1
and it 's also funny , too , how women perceive women , and how men perceive women			0
because a woman will look at the skinniest person and think that 's the most attractive , and a man will not think that 's attractive at all ! q : everything i 'm seeing now is about @entity181 , like , " @entity113 , she 's rail thin			0
" but it seems like people are worried that she 's stressed			0
i feel like 10 years ago , it would have been like , " oh , she looks incredible			0
" whereas you look at her sister , who has such a fabulously athletic body -- i mean , a real athlete 's body -- and i think there 's this movement now , where more women , finally , want to look like that			1
@entity0 : 25 shocking celebrity weight changes q : how will you raise your daughter so she has a healthy outlook ? well , we 've already taught her to love [ healthy ] food			1
we took her to sushi on saturday night , and everybody could n't believe what she inhaled			1
i think it 's important at a young age to enjoy different tastes			0
and we make this green juice for her			0
it 's basically everything but the kitchen sink			0
we go to the farmers ' market and buy everything and just put it in the juicer : kale , @entity220 chard , carrots , celery			1
and now we 've all started drinking it , and we 've all been healthier			0
q : you drink it in the morning ? in the afternoons			0
and we all get that boost			0
@entity231 to clean up , though			0
i 'm going to invent a juicer that self - cleans and i 'm going to retire ! q : who gets the job of having to clean it ? [ puts head down and jokingly whispers ] my husband			1
@entity0 : 11 healthy milk shakes and smoothies q : what has been your favorite age ? oh , right now , for sure			0
a lot of people say how much more relaxed i am , and it 's because i do n't take things as seriously			1
you know , it 's not just [ about ] work , i have a different priority			0
and i can let things roll off differently			1
the only thing that makes me mad is if i lose time with my child			0
q : is there a way you speed up the quality time with your family ? napping			1
that 's why i never do anything at lunch , because most of the time i eat before we break for lunch , and i nap during lunch			0
i do n't want to miss the mornings with her , so no matter how late we work , i get up with her			1
my weekends i refuse to work			0
because that 's her time			0
i love this job -- it 's not my first priority anymore			0
q : what 's your go - to healthy meal ? sushi , probably			0
i eat a lot of fish , and it 's so high in omegas			0
i do love some halibut sashimi with truffle , i like me some blue crab hand roll			0
ooh , i 'm making myself hungry			0
q : what 's the one thing you put on that makes you feel really good about yourself ? i 'm a @entity41 : t - shirt and blue jeans			0
my stylist years ago said , " if you have a crisp white shirt and a nice pair of blue jeans , you ca n't go wrong			1
" @entity0 : the best jeans for your body q : do you worry about what you 're putting on , and if paparazzi will be taking pictures ? if you 've seen some of my paparazzi pictures recently , you would knoooooow i do n't ! q : you and your husband have been married for nine years , which is a lifetime in @entity51 , of course			1
what 's your secret ? we communicate			0
it 's not a secret , but it 's how i handle all my good relationships , whether they 're male - female [ or not ]			0
if you bottle things up , it explodes on you			1
q : how do you keep from getting too stressed out ? i 'm not saving the world			0
i have to remember that i like my job , but it 's work , and it 's not my life			0
my life is my family			1
and i think that 's the best thing			0
you know , take a minute			0
it 's not the end of the world			0
q : if you could paint a picture of you in your happiest place , where are you ? snuggling with my daughter			1
i could be on a subway			0
