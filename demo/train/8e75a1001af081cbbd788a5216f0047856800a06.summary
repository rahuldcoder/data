@entity0 -- @entity3 congressman @entity2 now leads among @entity5 republicans and has tied @entity6 for second in @entity8			1
@entity10 conservatives have cycled through a series of " @entity12			2
" is it now @entity2 's turn ? @entity2 's core following has been small but fervid			1
however , @entity2 now is gaining a larger following , especially among younger voters attracted by his message of drug legalization and his comprehensive -- if utterly wrong - headed -- explanation of the country 's economic crisis			1
unexpectedly , young voters seem also to appreciate @entity2 's grandfatherly anti-charisma : his self - presentation as a good - natured old codger , charmingly baffled by the modern world			1
the ill - fitting suits , the quavering voice and the slack - jawed laugh all support the image of an anti-politician , the lone voice of integrity in a sullied word			0
there is however a flaw in this benign image of @entity2 : the now - notorious newsletters published under his name in the early 1990s			1
@entity2 collected nearly a million dollars in one year from newsletters suffused with paranoia , racial bigotry and support for the period 's violent militia movements			1
four years ago , @entity46 of the @entity47 unearthed partial collections of the newsletters in the libraries of the @entity51 and the @entity52			0
from @entity46 's subsequent report : " take , for instance , a special issue of the @entity55 , published in june 1992 , dedicated to explaining the @entity58 riots of that year			0
' order was only restored in @entity58 when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began , ' read one typical passage			0
" according to the newsletter , the looting was a natural byproduct of government indulging the black community with ' " civil rights , " quotas , mandated hiring preferences , set - asides for government contracts , gerrymandered voting districts , black bureaucracies , black mayors , black curricula in schools , black tv shows , black tv anchors , hate crime laws , and public humiliation for anyone who dares question the black agenda			0
' it also denounced ' the media ' for believing that ' @entity91 's number one need is an unlimited white checking account for underclass blacks			0
' " there 's a lot more in this vein			0
@entity2 now claims that he did not write the newsletters , was unaware of their contents at the time and now has no idea who did write them			1
it 's fair to say that almost no one who has followed the controversy believes that @entity2 is telling the truth about any of this			1
the authorship of the newsletters is an open secret in the libertarian world : they were produced by a community of writers led by @entity2 aides @entity117 and @entity118 , who wrote a newsletter of their own at the same time that expressed similar ideas in similar language			1
the racism of the newsletters -- and the elaborate lying subsequently deployed to evade responsibility for the newsletters -- say much about the ethics of @entity2 himself and the circle around him			1
yet @entity2 is something more ( or less ) than a racist crank			1
as @entity133 aptly observed in the @entity134 last week : " as crazy as it sounds , @entity2 's newsletter writers may not have been sincerely racist at all			1
they actually thought appearing to be racist was a good political strategy in the 1990s			0
after that strategy yielded almost nothing -- it was abandoned by @entity2 's admirers			1
" a fellow libertarian offers more detail on @entity2 's racism - as - strategy			1
@entity2 and his circle aspired " to create a libertarian - conservative fusion ... [ by ] appealing to the worst instincts of working / middle class conservative whites by creating the only anti-left fusion possible with the demise of socialism : one built on cultural issues			2
... [ the strategy ] apparently made some folks ( such as @entity117 and @entity2 ) pretty rich selling newsletters predicting the collapse of @entity160 civilization at the hands of the blacks , gays , and multiculturalists			1
the explicit strategy was abandoned by around the turn of the century , but not after a lot of bad stuff had been written in all kinds of places			0
" do n't get the idea , however , that racism - as - strategy was some brief , futile dead - end for @entity2			2
@entity2 exploited bigotry throughout his career , before as well as after the newsletter years			2
as @entity188 and @entity189 reported in the libertarian magazine reason , " @entity177 president @entity176 told @entity178 he recalls a conversation from some time in the late 1980s in which @entity2 claimed that his best source of congressional campaign donations was the mailing list for @entity183 , the conspiracy - mongering , anti-semitic tabloid run by the holocaust denier @entity186 until it folded in 2001			2
" @entity176 is the president of the premier institution in the libertarian world			0
if his recollection is correct , @entity2 was appealing to consumers of @entity187 denial for political purposes half a decade before the newsletters commenced			1
nor is it wholly accurate to describe @entity2 's strategy of appealing to the extremes as " abandoned			1
" @entity2 delivered the keynote address to the @entity203 as recently as the summer of 2009			2
he is a frequent guest on the @entity205 radio program , the central station for @entity207			0
as i can attest first - hand , anybody who writes negatively about @entity2 will see his email inbox fill rapidly with anti-semitic diatribes			2
not all the " bad stuff " of @entity2 's newsletter period was racist , exactly			1
some of it was just general - purpose paranoia , designed to trick money out of the pockets of the fearful and gullible			0
@entity218 has unearthed an example of a solicitation letter for the @entity2 newsletters : the solicitation warns of the coming danger of " new money " : " i uncovered the new money plans in my last term in the @entity227 , and i held the ugly new bills in my hands			1
i can tell you - they made my skin crawl ! " these totalitarian bills were tinted pink and blue and brown , and blighted with holograms , diffraction gratings , metal and plastic threads , and chemical alarms			0
it was n't money for a free people			0
it was a portable inquisition , a paper ' third degree ' to allow the feds to keep track of @entity91 cash , and @entity91 citizens			0
" [ in an e-mail to @entity1 , @entity2 's campaign chairman @entity252 said , " dr. @entity2 did not write that solicitation and the signature is an auto pen			1
it does not reflect his thoughts and is out of step with the message he has espoused for 40 years			0
" he added , " he should have better policed it and ... he has assumed responsibility and apologized			0
" ] the daffy old coot side of @entity2 's personality is genuine enough			1
the crank side is certainly genuine , as are at least some of the racial views			0
even after @entity2 abandoned the crude race - baiting of his 1990s newsletters , he continued to engage in elaborate apologetics for the @entity274 side of the @entity275			2
also genuine , however , is the huckster aspect of the @entity2 persona			2
that 's the persona that terrifies people who had never before heard of " diffraction grating " that the government might use this optical scanning technology , which can detect counterfeiting , to wiretap their wallets			0
@entity2 's admirers see him as a man of integrity			1
they are tragically mistaken about that			0
despite his too - dotty - to - lie persona , @entity2 is not in fact on the level			2
in evading responsibility for his newsletters , @entity2 has replied " i do n't know " and " i do n't remember " to queries whose answers he must know and surely remembers			2
the back story of the newsletters shows a man who , sufficiently saturated in racism and extremism himself , was ready to exploit the even greater racism and extremism of others for financial gain			0
@entity2 is the @entity308 of monetary cranks -- and this latest presidential campaign represents the summit of his bunco artist career , his very own " @entity312			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity315 .			0

@entity315 says @entity2 is riding high in @entity10 polls
he says @entity2 benefits from an image of being a codger *unafraid* to say what he thinks
@entity315 says racist remarks in @entity2 's newsletters belie the benign image he projects
he says @entity2 has peddled extreme views for his personal benefit
