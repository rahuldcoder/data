@entity0 -- a " defiant " pregnant woman who was subjected to three taser stun gun shocks by law enforcement officers after refusing to sign a speeding ticket will not get her appeal addressed by the @entity7			1
the justices without comment tuesday rejected separate petitions from both @entity11 and the @entity13 police officers sued for excessive force			1
the court also rejected a similar appeal from a separate plaintiff in @entity18			1
hundreds of such taser - related lawsuits have been working their way through lower state and federal courts , but the @entity7 so far has refused to address the issue of what the officers call " a useful pain technique			1
" @entity27 was seven months pregnant and driving her 11 - year - old son to school in 2004			0
police clocked her going 32 miles per hour in a 20 mph school zone			1
she handed over her driver 's license but denied wrongdoing			0
a speeding citation was issued but the woman refused to sign it as state law required			1
@entity27 later claimed she mistakenly believed signing the ticket was an admission of guilt			1
an argument ensued with two police officers			1
a federal appeals court later said , " she remained defiant even after ( officer ) @entity47 told her she 'd be arrested if she continued to refuse			0
" a police sergeant soon arrived and informed the motorist that force would be applied if she did not get out of her vehicle as ordered			1
a taser electro - shock weapon was displayed , and officers warned her it would be used if there was further resistance			1
@entity27 explained her pregnancy , and later claimed one of the officers replied , " well , do n't do it in her stomach , do it in her thigh			1
" the @entity65 was applied in a " drive - stun " mode three times in a one - minute span -- in her thigh , arm , then neck , according to court testimony			0
@entity27 fell out of the vehicle , was dragged onto the street face down , and then was handcuffed			0
she gave birth weeks later to a healthy girl			0
soon after , the then - 33 - year - old woman was cited for a misdemeanor , refusing to sign the ticket , but not for resisting arrest			1
she sued , claiming emotional and physical scars from the incident			2
a federal appeals court in @entity85 eventually issued a split decision , finding excessive force was used , but saying the officers could not be sued because " it was not sufficiently clear " in the law at the time that what they were doing was a constitutional violation			1
first the judges found the force applied was unreasonable			2
" the record unambiguously reflects that the officers knew about and considered @entity27 's pregnancy before tasing her , " said the ruling from october			2
" three tasings in such rapid succession provided no time for @entity27 to recover from the extreme pain she experienced , gather herself , and reconsider her refusal to comply			0
" but on the immunity question , the officers were cleared from liability			2
two judges said @entity27 brought some of the problems on herself			0
" the officers , for their part , were endlessly patient , despite being called liars and otherwise abused by @entity27 , " said chief judge @entity112			2
" they deserve our praise , not the opprobrium of being declared constitutional violators			0
the city of @entity13 should award them commendations for grace under fire			0
" and judge @entity123 noted force must sometimes be used even when the underlying offense is minor			2
" no constitutional violation was shown			0
@entity27 conceded that the police had the right to remove her from the car when she repeatedly refused to step out voluntarily , " said the judge			1
" there are only so many ways that a person can be extracted from a vehicle against her will , and none of them is pretty			0
fists , batons , choke holds , dogs , tear gas , and chemical spray all carry their own risks to suspects and officers alike			2
" a similar appeal heard by the judges came from @entity150 , when a 2006 domestic disturbance got out of hand after officers arrived on the scene			1
@entity155 was tased with a dart - mode device in a rapidly escalating and confusing scene inside a residence			0
she and her husband , @entity160 , were arrested on harassment , resisting arrest and obstruction charges , which were eventually dropped			0
the appeals court ruled the same : force was excessive , but the officers could not be sued			1
the appeals court rulings ultimately cleared the officers , but made clear future law enforcement use of a taser and similar devices might be a constitutional violation of a suspect 's search - and - seizure rights			2
the @entity7 has generally been tolerant of police use of force when dealing with belligerent or defiant individuals , but has not yet accepted any cases on the specific use of @entity65 , a brand name from a company by the same name			1
the justices have noted similar excessive force claims are by nature fact - specific , and have usually been reluctant to substitute their hindsight judgment for the real - time decision - making officers must practice in a stressful , often dangerous situation			1
in an unrelated the 2007 ruling , the high court noted that while any " attempt to craft an easy - to - apply legal test in the @entity195 context is admirable , in the end we must still slosh our way through the factbound morass of ' reasonableness			0
' whether or not ( an officer 's use of forceful ) actions constituted application of " deadly force , " all that matters is whether ( the officer 's ) actions were reasonable			2
" tasers are handheld devices that use electric current to cause a disruption of physical control from " neuromuscular incapacitation , " according to the company 's website			0
some law enforcement agencies consider them a safer alternative to other forced - restraint methods , for both suspects and police			0
@entity27 asked the high court to hold the officers liable for damages , while the officers asked the high court not to restrict future use of the forced - compliance and immobilizing tools			0
their employer , the @entity229 , had asked the justices to stay out of the case , worried it and other law enforcement agencies would be subject to a flood of personal injury claims			1
@entity27 herself is continuing a separate state lawsuit seeking damages			0
the cases are @entity240 v. @entity27 ( 11 - 898 ) ; @entity27 v. @entity240 ( 11 - 1045 ) ; @entity241 v. @entity155 ( 11 - 1032 ) ; and @entity242 v. @entity241 ( 11 - 1165 ) .			0

@entity11 sued @entity229 officers , saying they used excessive force
she refused to sign a speeding ticket because she thought doing so would admit guilt
justices rejected her appeal without comment , along with a petition from police officers
