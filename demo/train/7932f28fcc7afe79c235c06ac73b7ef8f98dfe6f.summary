-- this is the time of the year when everyone can channel their inner @entity3			1
just make sure not to startle your co-workers if you start yelling , " awesome , baby ! " everyone in the entire country , starting on selection sunday when the @entity12 brackets are revealed , becomes a college basketball expert			1
from president @entity15 to that annoying woman in accounting who lets her corgie make the picks ( and still somehow wins the office pool ) , we 're all about to pretend we know more about @entity22 than the prince himself			0
so if you 're just now beginning to pay attention , here is an @entity28 - z primer of what you 're going to find in your brackets			1
@entity31 is for @entity32 , which is the real first name for dynamic @entity35 guard @entity34			0
he averages 4.9 assists for the @entity38 , which went 30 - 1 in the regular season to become one of the favorites this month			1
@entity42 is for @entity43 , which is where a few thousand fans will converge during the @entity45 ( the games are march 31 and april 2 )			1
this is the fifth time @entity48 has hosted the event , and if you believe geography has anything to do with a team 's success , you might pick @entity55 ( the winners there in 1982 and 1993 ) , @entity57 ( 1987 ) or @entity35 ( 2003 )			1
@entity58 is for @entity59 , the defending national champions who have had anything but a smooth season wearing the crown			1
the @entity65 underachieved to start the season , then watched their iconic head coach , @entity67 , sidelined with back problems			1
but now @entity67 is back , and there 's no doubting his team has talent			1
" it 's been a different kind of season , " he said at the @entity73			1
" but through it all , somewhat by separation , i realized how much i care about these kids			0
" @entity80 is for @entity81 , and if you like watching college basketball to see a player develop , you like @entity85			0
the forward averaged just 3.3 points and 3.3 rebounds as a freshman at @entity90 , but four years later , he was named @entity91 in leading the @entity92 to a share of the league title			1
@entity95 is for emergency room , which is where @entity99 center @entity97 was rushed on april 28 , 2010 , after his heart stopped			0
his condition was so serious the school prepared a press release to announce his death , but two years later with @entity97 as the key player up front , the @entity101 are potentially one of 10 @entity73 teams that could make the tournament field			2
@entity112 is for @entity113 , the head coach at @entity114			0
you want a successful first season on the job ? try @entity113 leading the @entity118 to a 27 - 4 record in the regular season			2
but now comes the real goal : getting @entity114 , which will be making its 25th @entity12 appearance , into its first @entity45			1
@entity123 : see where your team stands for @entity12 @entity126 is for @entity127 , the nickname for @entity131 champion @entity129			1
if you 're from @entity132 ( or just enjoy @entity134 's beer ) , you 'll like the @entity127 : they 've built their program on a pipeline from @entity138 that now includes conference player of the year @entity140			2
as fans chant during their games , " @entity138 ! @entity138 ! @entity138 ! @entity143 ! @entity143 ! @entity144 ! " @entity145 is for @entity146 , which is getting as much attention for its basketball team these days as its business school			0
not only are the @entity150 back in the tournament for the first time since the @entity153 ( that 's 1946 ) , but their former star @entity154 has quickly become a worldwide superstar for his surprising play for the @entity157			1
@entity158 is for @entity57 , back in the @entity12 for the first time since 2008			1
if that does n't seem like a long drought , consider : the @entity162 were a tournament fixture every year from 1986 to 2003 and have won five titles ( 1940 , 1953 , 1976 , 1981 and 1987 )			1
@entity165 is for @entity166 , the unique mascot for first - time tournament participant @entity168			1
the origin is believed to be an early 1900s newspaper article that described the team " as quick as jackrabbits			0
" and they better be , since they 're likely headed to a first - round matchup with one of the top programs in the country			0
@entity179 is for @entity180 -- or , if you prefer , coach k. @entity181 coach @entity180 has won this tournament four times , more than any coach in the tournament ( just one man in the history of college basketball , @entity191 with 10 , has more )			2
do the @entity192 have what it takes to deliver no. 5 ? they 'll have to count on emerging freshman star @entity197 if they do			2
@entity199 is for @entity200 ( @entity201 ) , where the colorful @entity202 is the head coach			0
when @entity202 was a graduate assistant at @entity201 , he worked a side job as a bartender in the @entity206 section of @entity207 -- and his reputation for courtside theatrics means the tv cameras will spend plenty of time watching him during the @entity214 ' first - round game			2
@entity215 is for @entity216 , which is the best team most casual college fans have never heard of			0
only a four - point loss to @entity219 kept the @entity220 from rural @entity221 , @entity222 , from entering the tournament at a perfect 31 - 0 , and with junior guard @entity225 ( 19.2 points per game ) , there 's no telling how far they 'll go this month			1
@entity229 is for @entity230 , and that 'll be one of the biggest questions heading into @entity234 : will the @entity235 finally earn their first ever berth in the @entity12 ? " the stats are out there , " is all head coach @entity239 would say when asked if his team belonged this week , so do n't expect much lobbying from @entity242			1
@entity243 is for office pools , on which the @entity245 estimates more than $ 2.5 billion is gambled each year			0
that 's a lot of people who think they know which no. 12 seed is going to advance to the @entity249			0
take the @entity0 bracket challenge @entity251 is for proud papa , which is how @entity254 coach @entity253 is feeling this week			0
not only are his titans back in the @entity12 for the first time since 1999 , but they 're in the field because his son , @entity258 , carried them there			1
@entity258 , who scored 21 points in the @entity262 championship game , could have played on a bigger stage but decided to stick with dad			0
" this is the greatest feeling in world ! " he said			0
@entity267 is for @entity268 , which did not make the tournament			2
but doing an a to @entity271 would be much easier if it finally did			0
@entity273 is for regionals , or the round of the tournament that determines which teams reach the @entity45			2
if you live in @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 or @entity282 , you might notice some folks wearing their team colors and milling around downtown bars and restaurants in a few weeks			0
@entity287 is for @entity288 , the nickname for @entity290			0
looking for the next @entity292 , that unexpected team to make a run to the @entity45 ? the @entity288 are deep and talented enough , with point guard @entity294 and 7 - foot center @entity295 , that it would n't be , uh , shocking if they went on a run			0
@entity299 is for @entity300 , as in @entity301 coach @entity300 , who has the @entity302 back in the tournament with their best record in 20 years			1
can they pull off a first - round upset ? " we have achieved our no. 1 goal now and that was winning the tournament championship to go to the @entity311 , " @entity300 said			2
" we are not out of our goals yet			0
" @entity313 is for @entity314 , and do n't bother looking for them in your brackets			2
the team with more @entity12 victories than any other is not in the field			1
neither is @entity322 , the surprising team from @entity324 that reached back - to - back national championship games			2
@entity326 is for @entity327 , back in the tournament field after pulling off perhaps the most unlikely @entity45 run in history last season			1
the @entity332 went all the way from the " @entity334 " -- the matchups played in @entity336 , @entity337 , on the tuesday before the full tournament gets under way -- to the @entity45 under head coach @entity340			2
can they do it again ? it 's unlikely , of course , but the @entity332 are one of the hottest teams in the nation , winning 17 of their last 18 games			0
@entity349 is for @entity350 , which started the season at 5 - 14 but managed to win the @entity352 to lock up its automatic bid			2
do the 15 - 18 @entity354 belong in the field ? as long as that means their cuddly amorphous mascot @entity357 gets a chance to dance in the dance , who cares ? @entity362 is for @entity363 , which has reached 10 of the last 11 tournaments but is sitting squarely on the tournament bubble this year			1
will the @entity366 and senior guard @entity367 make it ? it 'll be one of the biggest questions when the field is revealed			1
@entity373 is for youth , and @entity350 is among the favorites to win the national title because of it			0
two freshmen have led the way for the @entity235 -- @entity380 , the 6 - 10 shot - blocking specialist from @entity242 , and @entity382 , the intense forward from @entity383			0
enjoy them while you can : both are likely @entity388 lottery picks if they enter the draft at the end of the season			0
@entity271 is for @entity392 , as in @entity392 , the @entity393 at @entity55			0
the @entity394 are arguably the most talented team in the country , but do they have what it takes to win six games in the tournament ? of course , if anyone could answer that question , it would n't be @entity12 .			1
