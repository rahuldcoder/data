-- if @entity1 prosecutes one of the men who helped the @entity4 hunt down @entity5 , what does it say about the state of relations between @entity9 and @entity10 ? nothing good , according to national security experts contacted by @entity0			1
new questions are being raised about strained ties between the @entity15 and @entity1 in the wake of a @entity1 commission 's recommendation of treason charges this week against a @entity1 doctor who helped @entity15 intelligence officials track @entity5 to a compound in @entity23			1
@entity23 is a largely military community on the outskirts of @entity10			0
" a case of conspiracy against the state of @entity1 and high treason is made " against dr. @entity36 , the information ministry declared , summarizing the commission 's investigation into the death of the @entity31 leader			1
it remains to be seen whether the government will act on it			0
@entity36 allegedly helped the @entity4 use a vaccination campaign to try to collect dna samples from people who lived in @entity5 's compound			2
the goal of the effort was to acquire dna evidence from @entity5 family members , according to @entity49 , a @entity50 newspaper			2
the vaccination campaign , a senior @entity15 official told @entity0 , occurred shortly before @entity15 forces raided the compound and killed @entity5 on may 2			1
@entity1 officials insist they were unaware of @entity5 's location , and have expressed anger over president @entity59 's decision to move ahead with the raid without consulting them			1
incidents such as the @entity5 raid and continued @entity15 drone strikes within @entity1 's borders have also raised questions of @entity15 violations of @entity1 sovereignty			1
several analysts also have noted lingering @entity1 anger over the case of @entity72 , a @entity4 contractor and @entity15 citizen charged with killing two men in january in @entity1			1
@entity72 was released in march after compensation was paid to the victims ' families			0
for their part , @entity15 officials have expressed concern over the alleged infiltration of @entity1 's intelligence services by @entity85 extremists , as well as growing anti-american sentiment in @entity1 , among other things			1
they 've also expressed concern about @entity36 being jailed without charges			0
" this was one small piece of a very large intelligence effort , " the @entity15 official said			2
" people need to put this into some perspective			0
" the recommendation is " a short - sighted move to gain leverage by the @entity1 in a troubled @entity15 - @entity1 relationship , " said @entity100 , a former national security official in @entity102 's administration			1
" they 're obviously angry at the @entity15 for the @entity5 raid , and this is just another way they can express their anger			1
" " each time one side does something to insult the other ... it undermines the ability to rebuild trust between the two sides , " @entity100 said			0
" every public move ( such as the recommended treason charge ) makes the private ability to negotiate a path forward harder			1
" @entity117 , a national security analyst at the conservative @entity118 , called the continuing uproar over the @entity5 raid the latest " in a long line of reasons for @entity1 being angry at the @entity15			1
" " never have we had an ally with whom we 've agreed on so little over such a long period of time , " @entity117 told @entity0 , noting @entity15 - @entity1 ties dating back to the @entity124 era			1
" the @entity5 raid was simply the icing on the cake			2
" but " any doubt @entity1 was n't knee deep in the @entity5 mess has now been put to rest , " @entity117 argued			1
" the fact that they 're prosecuting the doctor shows that given a choice between the @entity15 and @entity31 , @entity1 would rather be an ally with the latter , " he said			1
some analysts , however , draw parallels between @entity1 's possible decision to prosecute @entity36 for treason and an earlier @entity15 decision to prosecute former @entity144 intelligence official @entity143 on the same charge			1
@entity143 was caught spying for @entity146 -- a close @entity15 ally -- in 1985			2
he was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment			0
" @entity1 has a pretty legitimate " case , said @entity149 , a national security expert and director of the @entity151 , a non-partisan @entity9 think tank			2
" it does n't really matter how valid the goal is			0
that does n't change the fact that you 're spying for a foreign intelligence service			0
" why , @entity149 asked , " should @entity1 somehow not play by the same rules that a lot of countries play by ? " @entity149 called the recent @entity72 case " seismically important " in @entity1			2
it " seemed to confirm a widely held view in @entity1 that a bunch of people working for @entity4 are wandering around their country			2
" " that 's the context in which ( the recommendation of treason charges ) is happening , " he said			0
is there anything the @entity15 government can do to help @entity36 ? " the @entity15 finds itself with very little leverage " in this case because @entity36 is a @entity1 national , @entity100 said , drawing a contrast to @entity72 ' situation			1
a solution can be found , she argued , but " i expect the @entity1 will exact some price for this			0
" it 's possible , @entity149 said , that @entity36 " may just become a bargaining chip at some point			0
" regardless of the circumstances , @entity15 policymakers have an obligation to do what they can to help @entity36 , @entity117 asserted			0
" it 's not just about this man			0
it 's about signaling we 'll protect anyone who comes forward to assist our fight against terrorism , " @entity117 said			0
" @entity5 is dead , but there 's always going to be a new bin laden out there			0
we 'll always need help like this doctor provided			0
" @entity0 's @entity201 and @entity202 and journalists @entity203 and @entity205 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 may charge a doctor with treason for helping @entity15 officials find @entity5
case creates new strains in already troubled @entity15 - @entity1 relationship , analysts say
the @entity15 may have little ability to help the doctor
