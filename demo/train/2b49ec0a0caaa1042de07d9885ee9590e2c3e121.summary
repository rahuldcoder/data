@entity0 -- @entity2 is the new @entity4 wardrobe			2
@entity4 's lawyer was unable to persuade a @entity0 judge to let the singer out of jail on monday			1
@entity4 , 24 , wore an orange jail jumpsuit at court , with his mother sitting behind him , while attorney @entity12 argued the singer should be allowed to enter another rehab program instead of spending the next month in jail			1
the singer was locked up on a probation violation warrant friday after he was booted from a court - ordered drug rehab program			1
assistant district attorney @entity19 said @entity4 has already been ejected from two rehab programs in the last five months and another program should not be considered			1
@entity24 judge @entity23 said he was concerned about a " provocative " statement counselors said @entity4 wrote on a card at the @entity28 rehab center			1
" i am good at using guns and knives , " according to a document read in court			0
the rehab program told @entity4 to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations , the document said			1
@entity4 refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient , according to the document			0
@entity4 's next chance to get out of jail comes on april 23 when @entity23 considers if his arrest on a misdemeanor assault charge in @entity44 justifies keeping him locked up			2
there is a possibility the judge will speed up that decision so @entity4 can travel to @entity44 for a trial on that charge			0
@entity4 's legal troubles began five years ago , when he beat @entity52 as the two sat in a rented @entity53 on a @entity55 street			1
he pleaded guilty to felony assault in june 2009 , which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor			0
the judge has revoked @entity4 's probation twice in the past year , most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the @entity65 after he allegedly punched a man			1
@entity4 voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a @entity44 jail in october , but he was kicked out a few days later for " throwing a rock through his mother 's car window " after a family session at the center , a probation report said			1
@entity4 was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment , the report said			0
" mr. @entity4 proceeded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother 's car window and it shattered , " according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report			1
his probation was revoked in november , but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90 - day anger management and drug rehab program			2
although he completed that program last month , the judge had ordered him to remain a resident at the @entity28 treatment facility until a hearing on april 23			0
@entity4 's probation officer reported at a hearing last month that the singer " continues to make great improvement " in dealing with anger , stress and drugs , but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in @entity44 on april 17			2
if he is convicted in that case , the judge would decide april 23 whether @entity4 should complete his probation in jail			2
@entity4 has been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in @entity0 three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements , his probation report said			0
at that rate , @entity4 could complete the labor in mid-october and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year			0
however , the clock is stopped while @entity4 is locked up			0
@entity1 's @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			0
