-- it started with sinus congestion for @entity3			2
then the splitting migraines came			2
@entity3 soon discovered the furry causes : @entity6 and @entity7			2
@entity3 endures headaches and congestion to keep her 30 - pound pug , @entity6			2
her 30 - pound pug and orange tabby scattered dead skin flakes around the house , triggering @entity16 's allergic reactions			2
her two daughters are also allergic , but their reactions are less severe			2
like the 10 million @entity21 pet owners with allergies , the @entity19 faced a dilemma : can human and dog co-exist in the same house ? " we love them , " said @entity3 about her family 's pets			1
they 're really our babies			0
they 're part of the family			0
we could never live without them			0
" allergies can cause itchy eyes , hives , sneezing , congestion or even asthma			1
to keep animals around , allergic pet owners get shots , pop antihistamines , squeeze eyedrops , squirt nasal spray , use inhalers or just deal with it			1
others try to find a dog that wo n't trigger the symptoms			1
president - elect barack obama 's family has said his family is seeking a " hypoallergenic dog , " because of his eldest daughter , @entity55 's , allergies			1
unfortunately , there 's no such thing			0
the belief that certain breeds are hypoallergenic is " a complete misconception , " said dr. @entity63 , chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at @entity66			1
" you ca n't predict by type or breed , or length of hair			1
" pet allergies are not caused by dog hair , the @entity72 noted in a recent statement			1
" the allergen is produced in saliva , urine , dander -- it 's not just hair , " said dr. @entity76 , an allergist at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			1
" even with a hairless dog , there are still allergens			0
" for their next pet , the @entity19 are considering a poodle			1
although poodles , bichon frises and @entity92 are often touted as hypoallergenic dogs , these breeds all produce allergens			1
there has n't been sufficient research to determine whether certain breeds are more allergy - friendly , said dr. @entity98 , an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the @entity100 in @entity101			1
" there is not a lot of research in this area , " he said			0
" there are differences between breeds , but we do n't have research to definitively say			1
" the key factors are the animal 's size and the volume of hair			1
the fur can collect pollens , mold spore and allergens and bring them indoors , triggering reactions			0
even so , reactions vary widely , because everyone 's body is different , doctors say			0
before committing to a pet , make an arrangement to bring the animal to the home for a trial period to see how the person with allergies fares			1
" it 's always going to be trial and error , " @entity63 said			0
" someone might be allergic to one breed , but the main dog allergen that people are allergic to is present in all dogs			0
" it is also possible for someone to develop dog allergies months or years after bringing the animal home			1
if symptoms arise , doctors recommend getting tested to be certain that the allergy is coming from the animal			1
allergic reactions could come from other irritants , such as pollen or dust			0
a person 's allergies can also inexplicably change over time			1
in the same way that some people outgrow food allergies , there is a rare possibility that pet owners could outgrow their allergies to animals , experts said			1
pills and medications are available to treat the symptoms , but the best remedy , said @entity166 , is to not have pets			1
" there 's nothing that can be done except for avoidance , " she said			0
" there 's no cure			0
you 're exposing yourself to high levels of allergens in your home			0
we generally recommend they should not have a pet			1
" for many families , having a loving , furry companion outweighs the runny noses , wheezing and water eyes			0
@entity3 , who is also allergic to mold , dust and yeast , suspects it 's not just the dog and cat causing her headaches			0
after cutting out beer , bread and cheese from her diet , she says she does n't get as many allergic reactions			0
but she ca n't pick up the cat without getting congested			0
sometimes @entity6 and @entity7 trot into the house bringing all sorts of allergens with them and trigger her allergic reactions			0
despite the discomforts , the @entity19 are n't getting rid of their animals			0
" our lives are so enriched because we have dogs and cats , " she said			0
" you can live in a positive way and live well with the pets or you can suffer every day and think it 's miserable			1
it 's really how you look at it			0
the reason we live with pets is because we live life in a positive way and we work it out			1
" her two daughters have cat allergies , but they do n't have asthma or breathing difficulties , so @entity7 is staying put in their @entity228 , @entity229 , home			1
" pets are healing for we humans , " @entity3 said			2
" they are for my children			0
we adore them as part of the family			0
on a mental health level , children gain something from pets			2
children gain a lot from being in nature and being outside			0
dogs and cats as pets are part of that experience			2
" pets do provide therapeutic value , said @entity98			2
" pets make people feel good , " he said			2
" pets reduce anxiety , blood pressure			2
pets are here to stay			2

10 million @entity21 pet owners have allergies
allergies caused by *protein* in animal dander , saliva or urine , not by hair
belief that certain breeds are hypoallergenic is " a complete misconception "
medications available to treat symptoms , but best remedy is not to have pets
