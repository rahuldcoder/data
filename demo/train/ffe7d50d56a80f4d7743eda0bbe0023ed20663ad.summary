-- if @entity3 lines and stories of violence , vehicular assault and child abandonment taught us anything , it 's that the holiday shopping season is a dark , competitive time			0
now search engines are getting into the cutthroat holiday spirit			0
in a new attack on @entity17 , @entity15 's @entity14 search engine accuses its rival 's @entity19 tool of being dishonest by only including paying vendors , ranking listings by how much they pay , and not clearly marking the results as sponsored			1
to make its point , @entity14 has launched a detailed site accusing @entity26 of unsavory business practices and coined a new word : scroogled			0
" in the beginning , @entity17 preached , ' do n't be evil ' -- but that changed on may 31 , 2012			0
that 's when @entity19 announced a new initiative			0
simply put , all of their shopping results are now paid ads , " reads the campaign 's mission statement			2
it goes on to say " when you limit choices and rank them by payment , consumers get @entity40			0
" the accusations are based on real changes			0
to appear in @entity19 results , merchants must now pay for @entity17 's @entity48 the company publicly announced the switch from free listings to a paid - inclusion system in may , and the transition was completed on october 17 in the @entity54			1
the new @entity19 will roll out in more countries starting in february			0
" the primary point is , we think they should stop the practice of pay to rank , or at least make it very clear what 's going on , " said @entity61 , senior director at @entity14			0
@entity14 's own search results also include results from companies that have paid to be listed			1
@entity61 says the majority of its listings are from vendors that signed up for free , but it also includes products from third - party aggregators like the @entity75 - owned @entity74			1
@entity14 has actually shut down its free sign - up for the holiday season , and any new vendors interested in being listed are directed to @entity74 , where they will have to pay to be included in search results			1
@entity14 does not visually differentiate between the free and paid listings , so shoppers do n't know if a vendor paid to be listed			1
but the search engine also does n't use any of that information to determine its rankings			2
by default , both sites sort shopping search results by their own custom " relevancy " algorithms			1
@entity17 's now weighs relevancy by how much a vendor bids , though it also takes into account quality and how relevant the results are to the search terms			1
to get past this biased listing , searchers can choose to sort by price			0
" if you actually were looking at pure price , they would be more comparable , " said @entity61			0
the disclosures that all @entity19 results are paid are somewhat hidden			2
on the main @entity19 page , a disclaimer that @entity17 is " compensated by some " vendors is buried at the bottom of the page			1
search results are formatted to look like a typical @entity17 results page , and you must click on a link that says " why these products ? " to see a similar disclaimer			1
( @entity14 's big @entity40 marketing push might actually address this problem for @entity17			1
now , everyone will know they 're paid			0
) by working closely with vendors instead of scraping public product feeds , @entity17 is attempting to tap into more current data , with up - to - date inventory and price information			2
as a result , the quality of the individual product search results should improve			2
the trade - off is that it is missing some major retailers that do not want to pay to play , most notably @entity17 's actual biggest competitor when it comes to online shopping , @entity131			1
@entity132 still includes @entity131 results , but @entity131 has positioned itself as an entry point for online shoppers in direct competition with @entity17 and @entity14			1
a @entity138 report released in july found that 30 % of online shoppers start researching products on @entity131 , while only 13 % started on @entity17			1
the @entity40 page claims the exclusion of free listings could result in " not getting the best price when you thought you were , " but cursory test searches of major tech products found prices were comparable on both sites			1
a camera might have a lower price on one , and a tablet come in a few bucks cheaper on the other			0
@entity19 claims a larger volume of product choices than @entity14 's product tool			2
@entity19 currently has around 100,000 vendors and over a billion products in its listings			2
@entity14 has 15,000 vendors and " hundreds of millions " of products			2
the @entity164 page is just one part of a spirited national campaign that will include digital , print and tv ads that attempt to vilify the first - place search engine			2
" this was meant to be a fairly lighthearted holiday campaign , " explained @entity61			0
he clarified that @entity173 is a reference to @entity175 , not the similar sounding naughty verb			0
seasonal hijinks aside , @entity61 said he has real concerns that this could be the start of a trend at @entity17 , spreading to other @entity17 services such as news			0
@entity17 is not addressing the @entity40 attack directly , but did release a statement touting the benefits of its shopping service , saying , " with new 360 - degree , interactive product images , social shopping lists and a fast growing inventory of more than a billion products worldwide , @entity17 is a great resource for shoppers to find what they need			1
" luckily , with access to browsers that support multiple tabs and basic math skills , shoppers can easily comparison shop their comparison shopping tools .			0

@entity19 is the target of a *nationwide* attack ad from @entity15 's @entity14 search engine
@entity17 now only includes paying vendors in its search results
@entity14 also includes paid vendors from third - party sites , but ranks paid and free listings equally
@entity131 , the biggest online shopping portal , no *longer* lists products on @entity17
