-- he travels in private jets and is one of the world 's highest - paid athletes , but @entity7 's humble beginnings are never far away from his thoughts			1
he recalls with fondness those childhood days when he used to race go - karts -- the precursor to his enormous success on the @entity13 circuit -- free of any pressure			1
back then he did n't have to worry about points or standings			2
his passion for motorsport stemmed from his father @entity19 , himself a former go - kart driver , and @entity7 is also quick to remember the sacrifices his parents made as they drove him around @entity23 and @entity24 during his rise through the ranks			1
his mother @entity27 would even make his racing outfits , adjusting the size of his overalls as her son grew up			0
" one of the most important things that i received from my parents was to have always this sense of family and to be united , " the @entity33 star -- who has an older sister , @entity34 -- tells @entity0 's human to @entity36			1
" you always have little fights with your family , with your sister when you 're a kid , but at the end of the day you must know that family will always be there			1
" @entity7 admits he wants to have children of his own one day , but for now he is focused on trying to win more titles with arguably the most famous @entity13 team in the world , the iconic " rosso corsa " of @entity33			1
talking to @entity0 at an exhibition of memorabilia in @entity56 documenting his illustrious career , the 32 - year - old reflects on his early days in @entity58 -- a city in northwest @entity23 , in the province of @entity61			1
" my father was the one to introduce the adrenaline and the passion for racing into the family , " @entity7 says			1
" the go - kart i had when i was three years old was going very , very slow			2
basically my father was walking alongside me to control the steering wheel or if i was doing any funny things			0
" the weekends were probably a nightmare for ( my parents ) because they needed to take the car , they needed to drive maybe 10 hours with me asleep in the back and then have a race somewhere -- and then come home because they needed to work and i needed to go to school			0
" @entity7 showed promise from a young age , but his mother and father made it clear that the priority was n't landing trophies			1
" first it was to study , " he says			0
" if i do well , i keep racing in go - karts			2
" i needed to do all the exams			0
i missed a lot of lessons and i needed to recover			0
i needed to recover in the back of the car reading books , so that was my school probably			0
" with his family 's support , @entity7 flourished -- becoming a megastar who last year was rated 19th in @entity100 ' top - earning athletes list on $ 30 million , and is considered @entity13 's most marketable driver			1
his first " key " moment , he says , was winning the @entity23 national championships in 1994			0
" i felt that this was a good moment and i would keep this trophy all my life because you never think that you will continue , " says @entity7 , a cycling enthusiast , too , who hopes to have his own team			1
" i did n't know if i would race anymore in go - karts or if my family would take me to the next weekend 's race			1
" you just enjoy the present			0
and maybe that was the nice thing about that period of my career when i was a go - kart driver			2
" you enjoy that sunday			0
you do n't think anymore because you do n't know if there is something more coming			0
" in @entity7 's case , plenty did come			1
in 1998 , he was runner - up at the @entity24 karting championships and two years later finished fourth in @entity123			1
@entity7 made his @entity13 debut with @entity125 in 2001 but was n't thinking of winning that day in @entity126			1
he was just happy he did n't crash			0
" we did n't have any preseason test because the car was n't ready , " he recalls			0
" it was just ready for the first race			0
they explained briefly what the steering wheel was , the buttons to press			0
" there was a panic moment because i did not know what the neutral button was , and i was trying to find it			0
i had one second or i would crash somewhere			0
" despite not tallying a single point in 2001 , @entity7 caught the eye and soon moved to @entity143 , where in 2005 at the age of 24 he became @entity13 's youngest world champion -- a record since beaten by @entity147 and reigning titleholder @entity148			1
" when you 're world champion , there are many memories from the past , 20 years in different motorsports , " says @entity7			1
" you arrive in @entity13 , you win the world championship -- that 's it			1
it 's enough for your whole life , probably			1
" the satisfaction you have in a few minutes of your life when you become champion , it 's enough to live forever			1
" yet @entity7 did n't stop there			2
he repeated as world champion to emulate the likes of @entity163 -- his hero			0
" when i was 10 years old to 15 years old , in my room when i opened the door to get clothes , i had a photo of @entity163 with a car			0
he was at @entity170 with @entity171 and i remember that particular picture every time i open the door of the room			0
" after leaving @entity143 for the first time in 2007 , he endured a difficult season with @entity171 , clashing with @entity147 and finishing third in the championship			0
his problems with the @entity181 driver led to accusations that @entity7 was difficult to work with , but he insists that reports of tensions with his teammates over the years are " exaggerated			2
" " it 's true that you should beat your teammate to have a better reputation or to have a better result in that weekend , " he says			2
" but believe me , when we are in a meeting or a debrief after a race , there are zero problems -- there are only good things , helpful comments from the other driver			0
" all are working together , if we discover something in the setup , immediately the other driver tests to see that positive result and confirm that that will be our standard setup from that moment on			0
" so there 's a huge communication and a huge teamwork , despite what you read or what you see from the outside			2
" like everyone else on the circuit , he has lagged behind @entity148 since joining @entity33 in 2010 , with the @entity220 driver claiming four consecutive titles			2
this season @entity7 is joined at the @entity225 team 's @entity223 headquarters by @entity226 -- the last driver to win the championship for the @entity33 back in 2007			1
@entity229 , the man @entity226 replaced , said last year he thought the two world champions would " collide " but @entity7 has welcomed the @entity230			1
" i think he 's very talented so that is a huge help and huge motivation for myself first and also for the team because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because @entity226 will deliver a good result , " @entity7 says			1
" myself i know i need to deliver my best			0
" and there 's nothing he 'd like more than adding to his already impressive collection of racing souvenirs			2
" if you ask me this question in 10 years ' time ... i will tell you that two championships are more than i could dream of -- i never thought i 'd become a @entity13 driver , i never thought i 'd win one grand prix			1
i 'm extremely proud and extremely happy with my career , " @entity7 says			2
" if you ask me right now ... i am hungry for victories , hungry for success -- i will tell you that two championships are not enough			2

the *foundation* for @entity7 's success stems from his family
the @entity255 remembers with fondness his childhood days of go - karting
@entity7 looks forward to starting his own family one day : " it is a goal of life "
but for now the 32 - year - old says he wants to win more @entity13 titles
