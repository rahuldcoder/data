-- @entity1 quit a lucrative job in international trade litigation to take up something he strongly believes in -- as a legal expert , a @entity6 and , most importantly , he says , as an @entity7			1
he wanted to make sure that @entity6 could fulfill zakat , one of the five pillars of @entity11 that mandates the giving of alms			1
@entity14 is especially important during the holy month of @entity15 , which ends on saturday			0
but after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , a dark cloud hung over @entity6 charities as the federal government heightened scrutiny over terrorism concerns			1
@entity14 suddenly became a risky religious obligation			0
agencies all over @entity7 from women 's shelters and health clinics to inner - city community centers saw donation checks dry up			1
" the fear of giving was very real , said @entity1 , 33 , who now works for @entity30 - based @entity29 , an agency that was created to address two needs in post-september 11 @entity7 : racial profiling of @entity6 and charitable giving			1
@entity35 partners with the @entity36 to attain accreditation for @entity6 nonprofits so that agencies can attain greater transparency and overcome perceptions of wrongdoing			1
plus , people can feel more at ease about their donations			0
the @entity45 , which began in august 2008 , examines nonprofits and trains agency leaders to comply with the federal government 's legal and financial regulations , said @entity1 , the program 's legal counsel			2
just before the start of @entity15 a month ago , three nonprofit organizations had met all 20 standards required for accreditation			2
@entity1 said several others are going through the process			0
in turn , @entity1 hopes that @entity6 charities will start seeing more dollars come their way			1
" we do n't make comments on which group to give to , " @entity1 said			0
" what we 're concerned about is giving the right way -- best practices for zakat			0
" to be able to give freely is a right of all @entity7			1
@entity1 takes phone calls from people around the nation seeking guidance			0
" we 're planning to send money , " people tell him			0
" is this group ok ? what 's the best way to send our donation ? " because of the widespread concerns , @entity35 decided to upload a guidance video on @entity80			0
it asks people to consider donating to @entity7 - registered tax exempt charitable organizations			2
it tells them to make the intent of their donation clear , keep records and perhaps ask for proof that the funds were used for their intended purpose			0
the guidance became essential after the federal government cracked down on @entity6 groups in 2001 , @entity1 said			1
according to the @entity98 , the @entity97 administration froze the assets of three @entity7 charities -- the @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 -- during @entity15 in 2001			1
six others have been shuttered to date , the @entity98 said			0
only one , the @entity100 , was tied to terrorism after five of its leaders were convicted of providing money to the @entity110 militant group @entity109			0
" the government 's actions against these three charities were the start of a pattern of conduct that violated the fundamental rights of @entity7 @entity6 ' charitable giving in accordance with their faith , " the @entity98 wrote in a report published in june			1
it said the result was that many in the @entity124 restricted or stopped their donations altogether out of fear that they would be investigated for terrorism			0
@entity1 , however , is hopeful the tide is turning			0
president @entity129 signaled change in his historic speech to the @entity6 world delivered in @entity133 , @entity134 , earlier this year			2
@entity129 said he was committed to working with @entity7 muslims to ensure they can fulfill zakat			2
@entity1 said the accreditation program , along with new government perspective , can return confidence and comfort to a religious obligation for @entity6			1
" it 's been tough for @entity7 @entity6 post 9/11 , " he said			1
" this has to do with civic engagement , to be treated as full @entity7			2
