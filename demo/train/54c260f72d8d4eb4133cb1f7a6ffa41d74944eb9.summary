@entity0 , @entity1 -- the next version of @entity4 will look a lot like @entity6			1
but the familiar pc design is still there under the hood			1
@entity10 unveiled the design for @entity12 at the @entity14 conference here on wednesday			1
the software giant plans to provide a more extensive demonstration at a conference for application developers in september			0
@entity4 8 , which may not be the final name for the operating system , wo n't be available in stores this fall , as optimists had predicted , said @entity24 , the @entity4 division president			1
analysts expect it to be released next year			1
the vast majority of pcs sold run @entity4 , but the tablet market currently belongs to @entity30			1
@entity10 put a large focus on tablets during the @entity12 presentation			1
@entity10 has been taking stabs at tablet pcs over the last decade			1
the company failed at its attempts to effectively adapt the @entity4 desktop , start menu and all , to touchscreens			1
in a grand concession , @entity10 is now borrowing a page from @entity30 's @entity43 and @entity45 's @entity44			1
@entity4 8 takes the colorful tiles and finger - swipe gestures from the @entity6 operating system and expands them to a larger screen -- in this demo , 10.6 inches diagonally			1
like a smartphone , the system lights up to a " lock screen , " which has some alerts and diagnostic information set atop a background picture			0
once inside , small squares represent each app containing snippets of information			0
a finger swipe on the right side of the screen opens a menu of buttons for functions like search , sharing and a shortcut to the home screen			0
swiping on the left side switches between open apps			0
@entity10 will ask developers to write software tailored to the new look			1
but the system will also run older @entity4 programs			2
they open to a screen that resembles the classic desktop , but windows can be dragged with a finger			0
@entity24 , the @entity4 head , stressed the importance of not abandoning the established and reliable technologies from the @entity84 era			2
" a mouse has a precision that your finger ca n't approach , " he said			0
" the mouse and the keyboard are just tools			0
they 're not evil in and of themselves			0
" @entity95 ceo @entity94 , who took the stage after the @entity10 folks , entertained the idea of building a @entity4 tablet			1
thanks to a recent partnership , @entity95 has " a very unique relationship with @entity10 , " and @entity12 looks " beautiful , " @entity94 said			2
companies with less unique relationships with @entity10 are n't as enthusiastic			2
for example , @entity106 ceo @entity105 told @entity108 that @entity10 was trying to set restrictions on software licensees			2
@entity10 comes into tablets as the underdog			2
the modern tablet war is already a year old , and new entrants are marching			0
@entity116 maker @entity115 is targeting businesses with its @entity118 , and @entity119 plans to install its webos software on the computers , printers , phones and tablets it makes			0
@entity119 may also license webos to other hardware manufacturers , @entity119 ceo @entity125 said here on wednesday			0
@entity12 is still in development , so it 's unclear how well the system will run on tablets			0
the demo was silky smooth , but the touchscreen @entity10 used was connected to a hidden desktop computer , rather than contained within the portable hardware			1
@entity10 says @entity12 will be able to run on processors designed by @entity137 , in addition to @entity140 chips			2
that 's an important addition because @entity137 's technology is winning among most smartphone and tablet makers			0
@entity137 president @entity145 predicted on monday that his chips will be used in at least half of all mobile devices sold , which includes laptops .			0

@entity4 8 looks much like @entity6 but also has the familiar desktop look
@entity10 unveiled the new design at a conference on wednesday
the next version of @entity4 is expected to be released next year
