for years @entity0 has battled the effects of rising waters on its historic architecture , but now it 's facing a new threat -- wheeled suitcases			1
city officials have become so tired with the cacophony of rumbling luggage they 're introducing fines of up to 500 euros ( $ 620 ) for anyone caught using one			1
the move , due to come into effect in may 2015 , is likely to create a headache for many of 22 million who annually visit the city and need to cart bags to hotels in car - free streets			0
for locals , long tired of plastic or hard rubber wheels rattling past their windows as they try to sleep , it will come as a welcome relief			0
the new rules , which will require luggage to be transported on quieter air - filled tires , are the idea of city commissioner @entity35 , according to the @entity37 newspaper			0
' serious discomfort ' city officials have reportedly said the noise from hard - wheeled suitcases and traders using trolleys was causing " serious discomfort			1
" there were also concerns about the " progressive deterioration " of historic marble steps , stone pathways and footbridges around @entity0 's old canals			2
the local @entity52 newspaper says the new rule will be legally binding as it 'll be written into local building code @entity35 has suggested the legislation will be an opportunity for an entrepreneurial luggage to cash in in by creating a @entity0 - friendly suitcase that runs on soft tires			2
whether or not the idea takes off could depend on how loud the rumblings of complaint from visitors are			0
do you think @entity0 is right to ban wheeled suitcases ? let us know in the comments below .			1

@entity0 *authorities* say wheeled suitcases are a noise *nuisance* and cause *damage* to historic streets
new laws *restricting* use of wheeled luggage will affect many of *27* million annual *tourists*
those *flouting* the *restrictions* could be fined up to 500 euros
