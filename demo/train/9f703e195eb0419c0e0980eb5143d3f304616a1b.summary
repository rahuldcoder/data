-- this week , @entity1 suspended all civilian and military cooperation with @entity3			1
@entity1 's top general said that 40,000 @entity3 troops are in a high state of readiness and could strike @entity8 within a few days			1
will @entity10 take territory from @entity8 , again ? before @entity10 annexed @entity12 on march 18 , not too many observers thought that he was seriously going to grab a piece of @entity8			1
maybe it 's just another political game for him -- all talks and nothing more			0
after all , @entity3 is legally bound by the @entity19 of 1994 , an agreement signed originally by the @entity21 , the @entity22 and @entity23			2
this document is an important part of the world 's nuclear non-proliferation pact			0
it secures sovereignty and territorial integrity of @entity8 in exchange for its non-nuclear status			2
at the time of the agreement , @entity8 had the world 's third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons			0
that 's why when @entity3 nationalists began saying @entity12 should be a part of @entity3 , few imagined that would become true			1
@entity10 can be iron - fisted and harsh , but he has shown respect for international treaties			1
during his press conference on march 4 , when @entity10 was asked if @entity3 was considering annexing @entity12 , he said no. then something changed			1
when the referendum was pushed forward to march 16 , it was amended to include the option of @entity12 becoming a part of @entity3			1
what happened ? is @entity10 just out of touch with reality , as @entity55 leader @entity54 once said ? this would be an easy explanation for @entity3 's takeover of @entity12			1
but i suspect that @entity10 wants to create a new reality , one in which a breakup with the @entity63 is no longer viewed as a potential drawback , but rather , a smart and savvy move			1
in @entity10 's new world order , existing institutions do not matter anymore : neither the @entity68 nor the @entity69			0
what are they going to do ? suspending @entity3 from @entity68 membership is n't going to scare @entity10			1
the @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity73 are upset that @entity3 has breached the @entity19 , but so what ? @entity10 's approval rating has increased , his political oppositions are split , and many @entity3 support the return of @entity12			1
@entity3 has more territory now , and there 's been no significant side effect			0
moreover , @entity10 wants more control over the @entity3 elite and their money			1
back in 2003 , the wealthiest of the @entity3 oligarchs , @entity87 , was suddenly arrested and served over 10 years in prison -- mostly because he was aggressively sponsoring different opposition parties and planning to run for president			0
@entity10 , who himself became president of @entity3 partly because of heavy contributions from oligarchs in his first presidential campaign , knows that the only thing that can defeat him is huge money			1
so he spent the last decade turning himself into a very rich man and making sure that he owns more resources than any potential competitor			0
being an oligarch in @entity3 is great -- as long as you do n't get involved with politics			2
the regulations are strict and the transactions are traceable			0
the oligarchs know the rules : when they want to have access to their money in @entity3 , they get out of @entity10 's way			1
certainly , after 2003 , no one really dared to try to compete with him			0
they can just look at @entity87 as an example			0
what worries @entity10 is money from abroad that would leak through the borders easily			0
that money is harder to keep track of			0
@entity10 has long insisted that the country 's new elite should bring money back to @entity3			2
but the @entity3 oligarchs have been spending their money outside of @entity3 -- by sending their children to @entity63 schools , buying up homes in @entity127 , or going on shopping sprees in neighboring @entity130 countries			2
the capital flight from @entity3 has steadily increased in the past years , reaching over $ 60 billion in 2013			0
now , every @entity3 oligarch has to decide either to leave the country and lose access to its endless resources , or bring all the money back			0
@entity12 gave @entity10 exactly what he desired -- an opportunity to build a financial iron curtain between @entity3 and the @entity63			1
and now that some of the elite are being sanctioned by the @entity63 , they 're finally forced to turn their attention -- and pocketbooks -- to @entity3			2
acquiring @entity12 and breaking up with the @entity63 is a win - win situation for @entity10			1
@entity10 can also take a page from other bad guys who did n't obey existing rules			2
maybe their successful experiences have taught @entity10 that it 's ok to play an enfant terrible of the world 's politics			0
just look at @entity154 , @entity155 and even @entity156 -- they are all doing quite well , are n't they ? @entity10 is playing by his own rules			1
what could the modern world do against a dictator with nuclear weapons and vast approval within his own country ? not much			0
and about the economic sanctions : how often are they truly successful ? only @entity10 knows whether he 's going to take more pieces of @entity8			2
the answer , " no , because @entity10 said he would never go beyond @entity12 , " is incorrect			2
" maybe yes , maybe no " is much closer to the reality			0
that 's bad news for the world .			0

@entity1 general said @entity3 forces are ready and could strike @entity8 in days
@entity178 : for @entity10 , annexing @entity12 is a win - win situation
he says @entity10 wants to build a financial iron curtain between @entity3 and the @entity63
@entity178 : @entity10 is playing by his own rules , the @entity63 ca n't really do much to stop him
