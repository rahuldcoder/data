-- a small tribe of @entity2 in @entity3 who have had virtually no contact with the outside world won a legal battle this week when rights groups stopped a @entity10 company from continuing to bulldoze the forest to clear land for cattle ranches			1
about 2,000 members of the @entity16 ethnic group live in 13 settlements in @entity18 and @entity3			1
the @entity16 tribe , said to number no more than 300 , is the last group of uncontacted @entity2 in @entity22 outside the @entity23 , indigenous rights groups say			1
the @entity16 , who are part of the larger @entity16 ethnic group , are nomadic @entity2 who hunt and fish , as well as gather fruit and honey and cultivate small temporary plots during the rainy season			1
they live communally , four to six families to a dwelling , in the dense forests of northwestern @entity3			2
two @entity10 companies have been rapidly clearing land the @entity16 live on , and the tribe has lost nearly 15,000 acres ( about 6,000 hectares ) this year , according to @entity39 - based @entity38 , an advocacy organization for the rights of tribal people			1
a ruling thursday by @entity3 's secretary of the environment canceled a special permit for one of the companies , @entity48 , to clear the land			1
the legal battle is being waged by local groups such as @entity51 , an acronym in @entity53 for @entity54			2
the activist groups have undertaken the fight without the knowledge of the @entity16			1
@entity59 rights proponents see thursday 's ruling as an important victory			2
" this sends a very significant signal , " said @entity62 , campaign coordinator for @entity38			0
" until now , the ranchers and the landowners have really had it all their own way			0
they are very politically powerful and well - funded			0
... this may be a sign that the government is starting to get a grip on the situation			0
" as their territory has been gobbled up , some @entity16 have been spotted by other @entity2 retreating deeper into the vanishing jungle : a group of eight or nine men on one occasion , a smaller group several days earlier , @entity38 reported in a release friday			1
the problems for the larger @entity16 ethnic group , who share a common language and culture and can be found in @entity18 and @entity3 , started about 50 years ago			2
between 1959 and 1987 , most @entity16 were forced off their ancestral land , according to the @entity87 , which describes itself as international network of citizens ' groups involved in efforts to defend the world 's rainforests			1
about 2,000 @entity16 live in 13 settlements : 10 in @entity18 and three in @entity3 , the rainforest group says			2
only the @entity16 tribe still lives in the forest , without contact with other @entity16 or foreigners , in an area known as @entity101			1
although no one has any direct contact with the @entity16 still in the jungle , their presence can be seen by such signs as footprints and holes in trees that indicate they have been gathering honey , the rainforest group says			2
there also have been occasional sightings in the distance			0
@entity62 said he interviewed a small group of @entity16 who made contact with the outside world in 2004 and who described what their life is like			2
" we were always running , " @entity62 said one @entity59 told him			0
" we would suddenly hear these bulldozers			0
we thought that it was a kind of monster that could smell us			0
we were very afraid , and we ran			0
" the bulldozers , @entity62 said , are much larger than the commercial bulldozers seen at construction sites			0
often , crews will string a chain between two bulldozers , which will move in tandem to cut down an increased number of trees			0
as a result , many groups of @entity16 are fragmented into isolated patches as they scatter , divided by areas with no forest and increasingly busy roads			1
families can be separated , and their lives become increasingly difficult , @entity62 said			0
by @entity38 's reckoning , the forest where the @entity16 live is being destroyed at a faster rate than the @entity149 jungle as a whole			1
despite thursday 's ruling , some observers say the future of tribes still living in the jungle in @entity3 and elsewhere , particularly @entity10 , does not bode well			1
" it 's almost impossible in some sense to protect these tribes , " said @entity157 , president of the @entity158 , a @entity160 - based policy center			0
the reason , he said , is the same as it has been since the western world started being colonized more than 500 years ago : " there 's a lot of money to be made			0

@entity16 tribe is among last uncontacted @entity2 in @entity22
ruling *revokes* permit for @entity10 company to clear forest
activists undertook legal fight without @entity180 ' knowledge
@entity182 has lost nearly 15,000 acres of land this year
