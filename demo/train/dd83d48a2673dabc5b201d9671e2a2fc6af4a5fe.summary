voters in 11 rural counties in northern @entity2 will go the polls tuesday to decide whether they want to continue living in the 137 - year - old state or break off and form their own			1
even if a majority of voters in the referendum approve secession , breaking away would be a daunting , perhaps nigh - on - impossible path			1
a new state would require approval first in the @entity2 legislature and then from the @entity12 , as laid out by @entity13 , section 3 of the @entity15			1
but then , that 's not the point			2
the point , says @entity18 , is to send a message " to the governor			0
send a message to our legislators , " said the commissioner of @entity23 , the most populous of the 11 counties seeking to secede			2
" we 're tired of being ignored , we 're tired of being politically disenfranchised , and if you do n't wake up and you do n't start to change things , you 're going to see more movements like this begin to take a more serious face and move towards creating our own political entity that we believe will protect our very way of life and our economy			0
" few in @entity2 expect the secession movement to succeed			1
but for many in the 11 counties -- 10 in the northeast and one in the northwest that would join @entity43 -- it seems the only viable option for having their voices heard in a @entity47 - controlled state legislature that they feel puts the concerns of urban residents ahead of the concerns of those in rural areas			1
in part , rural @entity54 feel they were n't heard when the state passed a stringent gun control measure , a law that lead to the successful recall of two of the state 's most powerful @entity47 legislators			1
but the straw that really broke the camel 's back , according to @entity18 , was an energy bill that raised the amount of electricity that must come from renewable sources			1
@entity18 argues the law unfairly favored urban communities while putting a much harsher , more expensive burden on those in rural areas			1
" we 're not renewable - energy unfriendly out here in rural @entity2 , " @entity18 said			1
" but when you start imposing mandates different on other folks than yourself , that 's the definition of tyranny , and i think it 's kind of where this whole issue started to manifest itself			2
" no governor wants to preside over a breakup of his or her state , and gov. @entity91 is no exception			2
" rural communities are hurting , but it 's not because of background checks on guns sales , civil unions for gay people or expanded renewable energy			1
in fact , these are popular proposals across communities large and small			0
the same is true of our efforts to protect water for agricultural uses , expand broadband into rural areas , and promote tourism and economic diversity across the state , " the @entity47 governor said in a statement			2
" there may be a political agenda behind secession i do n't get , because when i think of @entity2 , it means all of our diverse communities and people			1
i ca n't imagine @entity2 being @entity2 without the @entity121			2
if this talk of a 51st state is about politics designed to divide us , it is destructive			2
but if it is about sending a message , then i see our responsibility to lean in and do a better job of listening			0
" when it comes to the counties considering secession , politics run hand in hand with geography			2
when @entity139 , a political science professor at the @entity140 did the math , he realized that had the 11 counties been a state of their own in the 2012 elections , that state would have been the second most @entity148 of all , behind only @entity149			2
yet @entity2 overall went to president @entity151 , earning 51 % of the vote compared to @entity153 's 46 %			1
" you see this going on in a lot of states , that increasingly you have one - party control in a lot of state governments			1
right now there are 43 states where one party is in control of both chambers of the state legislature , " @entity139 said			1
" that 's actually the highest number since the 1950s , and the minority party is looking for ways to stop that in different places			0
" but @entity174 says secession is n't about politics			0
" it 's about having a government that is responsive to the needs of its communities , and what we 've seen at the state level is an urban - based legislature forced their will against rural @entity2 time and time again , " said the organizer of @entity178			1
" we think this is a healthy response to this urban - versus - rural divide that 's not just the case in @entity2			1
it 's really throughout the country			0
" secession is not the only item on @entity2 's referendum ballot tuesday			1
while only the 11 northern counties will be voting on breaking away from the state , all the @entity2 will be voting on a school - funding bill and on raising new taxes for marijuana , which was recently legalized			1
a new state from a portion of the old is not unprecedented , @entity18 said			0
of the 50 states , five were once part of another : @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			0
also worth noting : no state has broken away since @entity210 in 1863 and no state has technically seceded since @entity216 in 1861			0
not everyone in @entity23 agrees with @entity18 and @entity174			0
district attorney @entity218 says he wo n't be voting for the non-binding measure , even if he understands it			0
" it 's not the best strategy			0
the best strategy for dealing with the political issues is through the political system , " said the @entity224 candidate			0
working through the system has n't worked out for a lot of conservative causes lately			0
" i think what 's happening is that things are moving so fast the people do n't feel included in the process			0
we 've legalized civil unions			0
we 've legalized a lot of things very quickly , " @entity218 said			0
" that 's a lot of change for people to accept			0
