-- the latest problems with the @entity3 witch hunt , the seizure of phone records from @entity6 , the conflicting @entity8 stories and disastrous attempts to enforce @entity10 may all seem unrelated , but they are not			0
each of these events is the direct byproduct of two central philosophies of the @entity16 administration -- the massive expansion of the size and power of the federal government and a lack of trust in the @entity24 people			1
these scandals were bound to happen			0
in fact , it was inevitable , and there will be more			0
president @entity16 has grown the size , the scope , the debt and the power of the federal government to such irresponsible proportions that problems like these are an inevitable result			2
lord @entity38 famously noted that " @entity39 tends to corrupt , and absolute power corrupts absolutely			0
" in a pathetic attempt to defend president @entity16 , another noted statesman , @entity16 , said that the president could n't possibly know about all these scandals because " the government is so vast			2
" therein lies the problem			0
the government is so vast			0
just a few years ago , president @entity47 assured us that the era of big government was over			1
he could not have been more wrong			0
now we have not just big government , but big brother running big government			1
we do n't know what the president knew of these matters before they became public , and it strains credulity to suggest that his top political advisers were in the dark			0
but again , when you grow government this big , these kinds of scandals are inevitable , and he bears the responsibility for that			2
are these scandals the byproduct of liberalism or incompetence ? i 'd say the answer to that question is yes , both			0
the @entity16 presidency , and liberalism in general , are based on not trusting the @entity24 people -- a belief that big government is better for people			1
the latest scandals show why liberalism and big government do n't work			1
the scandals cut at the core ideology of the @entity16 presidency			2
indeed , these issues are n't just the failure of an individual , but the failure of a system in which liberals put too much trust in big government			1
look at liberalism across every issue , from healthcare to energy to spending , and one thing is crystal clear : liberals do n't believe in the dynamic and transformative power of freedom			0
bigger government and more power in the hands of a few means the interests of the public will be violated			0
many are wondering aloud if these scandals will tarnish @entity16 's legacy or weaken his presidency or cause his popularity to drop			2
some of that will probably occur , but it 's not the ever - charming @entity16 who will suffer the most from these scandals			2
no , fortunately the biggest loser here will be the paternalistic big government liberalism that @entity16 has foisted upon us			1
we need leaders who have more confidence in the @entity24 people , and more skepticism for big government			1
maybe we can get @entity47 to pronounce the second end of the era of big government ? it 's time for @entity126 to be put down			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of gov. @entity129 .			1

gov. @entity129 : there 's a common element in woes facing @entity16 *adminstration*
he says *controversies* flow out of a belief in the *virtues* of big government
@entity129 : @entity47 *declared* end of era of big government ; @entity16 has restored it
