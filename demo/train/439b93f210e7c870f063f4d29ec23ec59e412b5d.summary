@entity0 -- president @entity2 reached out to @entity3 on friday -- the start of the @entity5 -- in a video message offering " the promise of a new beginning " that is " grounded in mutual respect			1
" @entity2 's message to @entity3 echoes his inaugural speech , where he said " we seek a new way forward			1
" the message is a dramatic shift in tone from that of the @entity19 administration , which included @entity3 , along with @entity20 and @entity21 , in an " axis of evil			2
" it also echoes @entity2 's inaugural speech , in which he said to the @entity26 world , " we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect			2
" in friday 's video , @entity2 said : " the @entity32 wants the @entity33 of @entity3 to take its rightful place in the community of nations			1
you have that right , but it comes with real responsibilities			2
and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the @entity3 people and civilization			0
" there was no immediate response from @entity49 to @entity2 's message , but @entity3 president @entity51 said last month that his country would welcome talks with the @entity32 " in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect			1
" the @entity32 , several @entity58 nations and @entity59 suspect that @entity49 has been trying to acquire the capacity to build nuclear weapons , but @entity3 says its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes			1
last month , the @entity0 - based @entity64 released a report saying that @entity3 has reached " nuclear weapons breakout capability " -- it has enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb			0
the report was based on an analysis of data from the @entity73			0
however , an @entity73 official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data , saying @entity3 's stock of low - enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons - grade material			0
that has n't been done , the official said			0
the @entity32 has had tortuous relations with @entity49 since the @entity26 revolution in 1979 , but the @entity2 message speaks of " new beginnings " with the promise of a new year			1
" we have serious differences that have grown over time			0
my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the @entity32 , @entity3 and the international community , " the president said			1
" this process will not be advanced by threats			0
we seek , instead , engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect			0
