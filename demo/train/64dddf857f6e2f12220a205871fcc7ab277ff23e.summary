-- in the three years since @entity4 's last album , the world 's problems have gotten a little more urgent			1
a cratering economy , riots from @entity7 to @entity8 , the prolonged ubiquity of the @entity10 -- these are things that ca n't be solved with a lullaby , even from the biggest band to emerge in the 21st century			0
but @entity4 's fifth album -- and most ambitious yet -- suggests @entity15 cares too much not to at least try to help			1
@entity4 recently entered their second decade together -- the same point @entity19 made " born in the @entity25 " and @entity26 made " @entity27 " -- so it comes as no surprise they 'd want a zeitgeist - y , big - statement album of their own			0
on " @entity29 , " the choruses are bigger , the textures grander , the optimism more optimistic			1
it 's a bear - hug record for a bear - market world			2
aided again by @entity34 , @entity4 are still dabbling in the kind of cool - weird artiness they truly went for on 2008 's " @entity37			2
" but where that album sometimes seemed like a self - conscious attempt to diversify their sound , with a world - music vibe and @entity26 - style sound effects , this time @entity4 have integrated the " @entity46 " ( as they call it ) into their own down - the - middle core : check out the cascading choral vocals that augment @entity15 's soaring refrain on " @entity49			1
" prominent elements prop up the sonic cathedrals : @entity53 's guitar , which is riffier and more muscular than ever , and @entity55 synths that would n't sound out of place at a nightclub in @entity58			2
@entity15 says " @entity29 " was inspired by 1970s @entity60 graffiti and the @entity61 -- resistance movement known as the @entity63 -- it 's probably no coincidence both were about young people embracing art in times of turmoil			1
here , @entity4 rage in their own lovably goofy way			0
on the rave - tinged " @entity72 , " @entity15 imagines a revolution powered by dancing kids			1
" @entity79 " might be the first @entity4 tune to which you can bust something resembling a move			0
the lyrics seem to be about fighting the man -- " do n't let ' em take control ! " -- but @entity15 sounds ebullient over a sproingy @entity82 beat			1
explicit political statements are n't really @entity15 's thing ; he 's in the uplift business			1
" @entity29 " suggests he 's fully embraced his role as a not - terribly - cool guy who 's good at preaching perseverance , in a voice that 's warm and milky like afternoon tea			1
by the time he croons , " do n't let it break your heart ! " over " @entity100 " - style guitar sparkle near the album 's end , you ca n't help but think he 's an inspiration peddler who believes what he 's belting			2
oddly enough , the best moments are darker ones			0
" @entity110 " is a ballad about loss and regret , co-starring @entity109			0
it 's a partnership that probably came together over champagne brunch at @entity113 's , but its synth - fuzz groove is offhandedly seductive			2
it 's followed by " @entity115 , " a minimalist slow jam			0
@entity15 sings nakedly about how breakups can feel like the @entity118 , or maybe it 's about the actual end of the world			1
either way , as end - times lullabies go , it 's pretty sweet			0
