-- the @entity2 ' failure to properly maintain a shipping channel linking @entity4 , @entity5 , to the @entity6 led to catastrophic flooding during @entity8 , a federal court ruled wednesday			1
" it is the court 's opinion that the negligence of the @entity2 , in this instance by failing to maintain the mrgo properly , was not policy , but insouciance , myopia and short - sightedness , " @entity18 district court judge @entity17 wrote in his lengthy ruling , referring to the @entity15			1
" for over 40 years , the @entity2 was aware that the @entity24 levee protecting @entity25 and the @entity26 was going to be compromised by the continued deterioration of the @entity15 ... the @entity2 had an opportunity to take a myriad of actions to alleviate this deterioration or rehabilitate this deterioration and failed to do so			1
clearly , the expression ' talk is cheap ' applies here			0
" @entity17 's ruling was issued in a lawsuit brought by six plaintiffs affected by the 2005 hurricane , who claimed the @entity2 was liable for damages			1
the judge ruled against one couple , who lived in @entity44 , but awarded the others , from the @entity26 and @entity46 , damages ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 317,000			1
" the people of this city are vindicated , " said @entity48 , one of the plaintiffs ' attorneys			1
" they did n't do anything wrong			1
it 's now time for them to be compensated			0
" the ruling applies not only to the six plaintiffs , attorney @entity59 said , but to 100,000 homes and businesses in the parish and the @entity26			1
under the precedent set by @entity17 's decision , they too will be entitled to compensation			1
" the judge 's ruling today validates the feelings and beliefs that many citizens have held for four years , " said @entity4 mayor @entity67 in a statement			1
" although the ruling is liberating for thousands impacted by the devastation and tragedy of @entity8 , it is my hope that justice will prevail to help families make their lives whole again			2
" once a category 5 storm , @entity8 had weakened to a category 3 storm with 127 mph winds when it made landfall on the morning of august 29 , 2005 , between @entity85 , @entity5 , and the mouth of @entity15			1
a few hours later , the storm again crossed over land on the other side of the river , its winds only slightly diminished			0
more than 1,800 people died in the storm , most -- nearly 1,600 -- in @entity5 , where @entity8 devastated @entity4 when the city 's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred			0
overall , the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people , causing more than $ 81 billion in damage			0
@entity100 called @entity8 " the single most catastrophic natural disaster in @entity18 history			0
" while courts have declared the @entity2 was liable for @entity8 flooding , judges until now have issued it a " get out of jail free " card , the plaintiffs ' attorneys said			1
" it has been proven in a court of law that the drowning of @entity4 was not a natural disaster , but a preventable man - made travesty , " the attorneys said in a statement			2
" the government has always had a moral obligation to rebuild @entity4			0
this decision makes that obligation a matter of legal responsibility			0
" @entity17 ruled that because the @entity2 failed to maintain the shipping channel , erosion widened it , and its banks -- which helped protect the levees -- deteriorated , leaving the levees unprotected , undermined and more vulnerable to waves coming off @entity131			2
@entity133 also failed to take other actions , such as armoring the banks with rocks , the attorneys said			0
" this court can not but comment that the @entity2 ' approach reminds the court of the old adage , ' close your eyes and you become invisible , ' " said the ruling			1
" it is beyond arbitrary and capricious -- it flies in the face of the purpose of @entity148 [ the @entity148 ] and ignores the very heart of what ' operation ' means , " @entity17 wrote			0
the plaintiffs claimed the @entity2 was not entitled to immunity because its activities regarding the shipping channel " were in direct contravention of professional engineering and safety standards , " @entity17 wrote			2
" ... ignoring safety and poor engineering are not policy , and clearly the @entity2 engaged in such activities			0
" " this is not the corps that built the @entity165 , " said @entity48 , another plaintiffs ' attorney			1
" this is a different corps			2
this is a corps that 's reckless			2
" the attorneys said they plan to go to @entity168 after @entity169 to meet with the @entity170			0
although the corps was given immunity from liability in areas like @entity174 and @entity44 , they said they would like to start a settlement process for all citizens			2
" we want to leave no residents behind , " @entity59 said			0
" we 'd like to have a regional settlement			0
" @entity0 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
