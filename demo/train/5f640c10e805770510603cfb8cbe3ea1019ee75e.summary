@entity0 -- outside the @entity2 in @entity0 on a recent winter day are the regulars -- a small , devoted team of anti-abortion activists , handing out fliers and urging patrons to hear their message : " save that child			1
" " every life is precious , protect that life within you			2
" " please change your mind			2
" several people pray silently nearby			2
clearly marked on the sidewalk , nearly 12 yards from the front doors , is a painted boundary , a line the protesters can not cross			2
by state law , their first amendment rights stop there			2
a metaphoric line -- testing the competing limits of what has become a constitutional fight between free speech and public safety -- will now be surveyed by the nation 's highest court			1
the justices on wednesday will step back into the larger national debate on abortion , when it holds oral arguments on a challenge to a @entity39 law that established tighter buffer zones around facilities that perform the procedure			1
a ruling is expected by june			0
the state 's " selective exclusion law " makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic " employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment " to " enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk " within 35 feet of " a reproductive health care facility			0
" anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from effectively talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances			1
but a federal appeals court a year ago said " the right of the state to take reasonable steps to ensure the safe passage of persons wishing to enter health care facilities can not seriously be questioned			0
" supporters said the law was established to protect clinic staff and patients from what they said was harassment and intimidation from protesters			1
some anti-abortion protests have turned violent in the @entity77			0
" @entity39 ' buffer zone statute strikes the right balance between ensuring safe access to medical facilities and preserving freedom of expression , " said state attorney general @entity78			1
" this law has enhanced public safety in a fair and constitutional manner			0
" her office will defend the 2007 law before the justices			0
its defenders said most clinic workers believe the current buffer zones have eased concerns of clinic staff , and created a more welcoming , calming environment for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies			1
demonstrators have appeared regularly at clinics in @entity0 , @entity101 , and @entity102 and say they are unfairly singled out for exclusions on public property			1
reasonable restrictions , or unfair treatment ? " the prohibition applies even to speakers who are entirely peaceful , do not engage in any obstructive or intimidating conduct , " said @entity107 , a @entity109 law professor representing the group , " and seek only to proffer leaflets , engage in consensual conversations , or even just stand and display a sign or pray			0
" lead plaintiff @entity117 is a lifelong @entity109 who generally spends mornings two days a week peacefully spreading her anti-abortion message at the @entity120			0
with a large cross around her neck , the 77 - year - old grandmother often uses a baby stroller as a prop , along with a portable dvd player with images of a fetal ultrasound			0
on a recent day , she was seen standing at the edge of the yellow semicircle ringing the @entity0 clinic on @entity132			0
the current state law strengthened earlier restrictions that had created a 6 - foot protective bubble around clinic patrons approaching the facility			0
abortion rights supporters said it was ineffective , since they claimed it led to blocked entrances , and a gauntlet of protesters surrounding patients and staff			1
the last time the high court took a close look at the issue was in 2000 , upholding @entity150 's broad " no approach zone " regulations			1
similar to the earlier @entity39 law , protesters were kept at least eight feet from anyone within 100 feet of any health care facility			1
" private citizens have always retained the power to decide for themselves what they wish to read , and within limits , what oral messages they want to consider , " said justice @entity155 for the 6 - 3 majority			2
" this statute simply empowers private citizens entering a health care facility with the ability to prevent a speaker , who is within eight feet and advancing , from communicating a message they do not wish to hear			2
" but , in dissent , justice @entity169 said anti-abortion protesters were singled out for special , unfair treatment			0
" does the deck seem stacked ? you bet			0
as i have suggested throughout this opinion , today 's decision is not an isolated distortion of our traditional constitutional principles , but is one of many aggressively pro-abortion novelties announced by the @entity182 in recent years , " he said			1
" uninhibited , robust , and wide open debate is replaced by the power of the state to protect an unheard - of ' right to be let alone ' on the public streets			0
" ruling could affect other types of protest municipalities in @entity191 , @entity150 , @entity192 , @entity193 and elsewhere have since enacted similar " fixed " and " floating " buffer zone laws for clinics			1
what the high court decides could also affect a broader range of free speech arenas , over issues such as war , taxes , corporate bailouts and elections			0
the justices last month heard arguments in a separate appeal involving a longtime anti-war protester kept from spreading his message along a public right - of - way at @entity211 in @entity193			0
the sidewalk outside the @entity77 @entity182 itself is the scene of daily anti-abortion protests sponsored by @entity215 , where mostly young @entity217 adults stand silent wearing red tape across their mouths with the handwritten word " life			1
" and next week 's 41st anniversary of the @entity224 high court ruling legalizing abortion will attract thousands of marchers on both sides of the issue outside the court , just across the street from the @entity231			2
the @entity39 case is @entity117 v. @entity78 ( 12 - 1168 ) .			1

@entity182 will hear @entity235 case wednesday
case is about protest buffer zone near abortion clinics in @entity39
zone supporters say it protects against harassment
*critics* say it limits their right to talk with patients
