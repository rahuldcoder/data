-- in tuesday night 's @entity3 address , president @entity1 is expected to focus on the crisis of widening inequality in @entity6			1
and it 's no surprise			2
over the last few years , he has tried to draw attention to the decimation of the middle class over recent decades			2
he 's explained the scope of the problem -- that the severity of today 's inequality is akin to what preceded the @entity18			1
he 's adopted a catchphrase -- prosperity from the " middle out " -- and forced @entity22 to talk about the issue			0
and he 's proposed policies to address it			0
but in his sotu speech , and in the bigger scope of his presidency , @entity1 must do more than unfurl a list of policy remedies			1
he first has to acknowledge and then reckon with the conflicting emotions @entity6 have about " falling behind			1
" to be clear , policy matters			1
raising the federal minimum wage would be an effective way to lift people out of poverty			0
doing what @entity38 's new mayor , @entity37 , proposes -- raising taxes on the highest earners to pay for universal pre-k -- would help alleviate the effects of wage stagnation and wealth concentration			0
but outside the reliably liberal precincts of cities like @entity38 , most people are n't ready to jump straight to policy fixes			1
something blocks them -- a set of stories @entity6 have learned to tell themselves about success and struggle			0
these self - scripts influence the entire inequality debate : -- if i 'm struggling , it 's my own fault ( and complaining about it is for losers )			1
-- i may be struggling , but i work hard and i do n't want people who do n't work hard as i do to get handouts			0
-- if someone else is getting rich , it 's just sour grapes for me to complain that they have too much			0
it 's unbecoming , maybe even un-american			0
-- i may be struggling , but there 's nothing to be done -- it 's out of my control , and i do n't trust anyone , especially government , to help me			0
i 'm on my own			0
to point out these self - scripts is n't to validate divisive right - wing rhetoric about " makers and takers , " or the over-the - top comments by a prominent venture capitalist arguing that critiques of the 1 % feel like @entity82 persecution of @entity83			1
it 's simply to describe a political and psychological reality			0
millions of @entity6 have internalized these beliefs , which are woven into our culture and go back at least as far as the @entity18			0
each script has an emotional core : shame , pride , inadequacy , helplessness			1
and so before he gets to the minimum wage or any other proposal , @entity1 would do well to speak directly to such emotions and neutralize them with a set of counter-scripts			1
he 's got to say things like : " if you feel the middle class has fallen out of reach and you need help , it 's not because you are a lazy moocher			2
it 's because sometimes we all need help , and there is no shame in that			2
" " there 's no substitute for hard work and grit			0
but some of the hardest working people in @entity6 are poor or barely hanging on to the middle class			2
we 've got to resist the temptation to kick the guy one rung below us on the ladder just to make us feel like we 're climbing ...			2
" " envy is an ugly thing			0
and when people use words like " socialist " or " class warfare " to shut down a conversation about whether our wealthiest citizens owe more to the society that helped to create their wealth , well , that 's bullying ... " " @entity133 told us we have nothing to fear but fear itself			2
in this age , nothing breeds helplessness like believing you are helpless			0
we can turn this around together -- if we remember no man is an island and no community can improve its lot without using government wisely and well			0
" i 'm not calling for @entity1 to channel former president @entity146 and conspicuously " feel our pain			1
" @entity1 just has to be @entity1 -- the author who acutely sensed and articulated the cross currents of ambition and anxiety around him ; the organizer who could navigate the unspoken tensions of identity that influence politics			1
@entity1 knows well that before the head can engage on a complex issue , the heart must be acknowledged and its pain and fear must be named			1
whether @entity1 can get @entity161 @entity22 to take action on inequality is not a matter of his willpower or assertiveness ; the most forceful president can not force @entity168 to enact a thing			1
what @entity1 can do is build public pressure on @entity168 to act			1
and the best way he can do that is to make more people feel truly heard			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

@entity177 : president @entity1 must do more than list policy fixes for inequality at @entity3
**liu** : he needs to reckon with those who have mixed emotions about " falling behind "
he says the heart must be acknowledged and its pain and fear must be named
**liu** : @entity1 must tell those who feel shame for being poor to do away with self - blame
