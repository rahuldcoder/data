@entity1 , @entity2 it looks decrepit and disheveled			1
but if a witch were rich , she might feel right at home in this @entity1 house			1
just a few blocks from @entity9 sits the @entity10 , or @entity12 's @entity11 as it is universally called , inducing double takes from most who pass by			1
" most people think it 's dilapidated and vacant , " says @entity15 , owner of the storybook home			1
" i 'm an odd person to begin with , and the home is so odd for its neighborhood			2
" if it were n't so impressive , the @entity12 's @entity11 might be an eyesore : the shutters look like they 're falling off , the roof is curling and the yard is thorny			1
it resembles the rickety gingerbread house occupied by the witch in " @entity28			1
" " the whole concept is that the house should feel as if it emanated from the ground , " says @entity15 , a @entity29 real estate agent who bought the home nearly two decades ago and has been restoring its , well , decay ever since			1
everything is carefully designed to create " a home that looks as if it 's 300 years old that really is n't			1
" take the rotting cedar shingles : @entity15 had them dyed to look like they 'd been on the home for centuries			2
the wavy look of the roof makes it appear as if " the home could take off at any moment , " he says -- witchcraft , you might say , achieved by stacking plywood underneath the shingles			2
@entity15 actually lives in the home , making it off limits to the public			0
but tour guides shuttle eager visitors past the home daily			0
" it is , i 'm told , the most requested noncelebrity house to visit in @entity59 , " says @entity15			0
and while overzealous tour guides tout its appearance in everything from " @entity64 " to " @entity65 , " @entity15 says the only modern - day film the home has appeared in was 1995 's " clueless			2
" " it was strictly a background shot ( with ) @entity70 walking by the house , " he says			0
" but everybody respects the home for being in that movie			0
" the @entity12 's @entity11 is believed to have first appeared on screen in the 1921 silent film " @entity77 , " says @entity78 of @entity79 , an organization dedicated to promoting the history of the city			1
the building was constructed a year earlier in 1920 on the @entity85 lot in @entity86 , @entity2 , and was used as both a studio office and dressing room , @entity78 says			0
after the studio shut down , a producer moved it to @entity91 in @entity1 in 1924 where it began its second act as a private residence			2
" the thing that makes this property important is it set the bar for storybook architecture in @entity59 during the ' 20s and ' 30s , " she says			0
by the time the home came back on the market in the late 1990s , @entity15 , a @entity101 , called it a " sixties nightmare " and it was only getting interest from buyers who wanted to tear it down , something the seller forbid			2
the more @entity15 showed the @entity12 's @entity11 , the more it cast a spell on him			1
" i think it just hit me one day , and i thought , ' you know what ? why not ? ' " he said			0
" jump in ; take a chance			0
i 'm big on taking risks			0
" @entity15 bought the home and over the next decade transformed it into what it is today : an upscale incarnation of a storybook home			0
he 's even furnished the home with pieces to match the fairy tale theme , including a dining room table with a tree - trunk base			1
today , the home is n't just a tour stop or a must - visit for trick - or - treaters on @entity132			0
in 2013 the @entity12 's @entity11 became an official @entity1 landmark , something @entity15 worked hard to achieve			1
" it gives me great joy to be able to bring joy to people who stop by to look at it , " @entity15 says , though he concedes there 's always a few scared by the @entity12 's @entity11 , particularly children			1
they might have good reason : @entity15 gleefully notes his oven is " just about perfect child - size			0
something every witch should have			0

@entity10 in @entity1 is universally called the @entity12 's @entity11
the house is designed to look like a fairy tale witch 's home
