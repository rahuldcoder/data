-- it was the goal that broke a thousand @entity3 hearts			1
almost three years ago , @entity4 fired an incredible shot in the nail - biting final moments of a @entity8 semifinal at @entity9			1
scored in the last minute of stoppage time , it secured a 1 - 1 draw and put @entity13 into the final on away goals			2
@entity4 's ecstatic team then took the title in @entity18 , beating @entity3 's @entity21 rivals @entity19			1
on wednesday , the @entity23 champions will return to @entity24 to face @entity3 for the first time since that fateful day on may 6 , 2009 in the first leg of this season 's semifinal			1
unsurprisingly , talk has centered on that goal , with 2010 @entity32 winner @entity4 adamant that this time around @entity13 will not settle for a draw			1
" we are going there to get a win , to put in a good performance and commit as few errors as possible , " the midfielder said on @entity13 's website			1
" i guess it 's inevitable that that goal is being talked about again			0
it 's good to remember it because it was a special and very intense moment -- not just for me , but for all of us			0
life goes on though , and wednesday is a different situation and a different game			0
i 'm very proud of that goal and happy to have been able to have that experience			0
it 's a feeling that is hard to describe			0
" however , @entity4 warned that @entity3 's squad -- which now includes his compatriots @entity53 and @entity54 -- will be a a strong opposition despite the @entity24 side 's difficult first half of the season , which cost coach @entity59 his job			1
" they have more experience			0
they were strong in 2009 and they will be stronger now -- strong , dangerous and intense			0
that will all be multiplied by the atmosphere at their own ground , " @entity4 said wednesday 's match will be the fifth meeting between the two sides in the knockout stage of the @entity8 , with 2009 's dramatic match still looming large in the fierce rivalry			2
that game is also remembered for @entity3 player @entity77 's foul - mouthed tirade at referee @entity78 after the @entity79 turned down four penalty appeals from his team in the second leg			1
the @entity84 striker is keen to move on from the outburst which landed him a three - game ban			0
" it is not about 2009 because i think about the other times we played @entity13 and it is not only bad memories , we have some good memories as well , " he said on @entity3 's website			1
" so it is 50 - 50 , even if @entity13 are set to be the best team in the world and they have the best player in the world			2
it is two games , anything can happen			0
" @entity77 has reason to be confident , with the @entity103 boasting a perfect record in the @entity8 at home this season , winning all five games played			2
" the only thing i want is to play on wednesday with my teammates and make a good result			0
@entity13 are the winners of last year 's competition and nobody expected us to be in the semifinal so we have to show that we deserve to be there , " he said			2
the match will be particularly loaded for @entity13 coach @entity117 and his @entity3 counterpart @entity118 , who faced each other as players for the teams in the @entity8 quarterfinals 12 years ago			1
again , it was @entity13 who triumphed , beating the @entity103 5 - 1 after extra time at @entity126 to triumph 6 - 4 on aggregate .			0
