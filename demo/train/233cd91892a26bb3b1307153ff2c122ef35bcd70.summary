-- president @entity2 cares , the @entity1 insisted tuesday in asking @entity3 for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds to better respond to the flood of immigrants illegally crossing the border into @entity8			1
no he does n't , say @entity9 who note @entity2 does n't plan to visit the border area when he travels to @entity8 -- the epicenter of the immigrant influx -- on wednesday for a trip that includes a meeting with gov. @entity15			1
amid the political sniping , many of the tens of thousands of young @entity18 immigrants who have illegally crossed the border into @entity8 this year remain in limbo while waiting to be processed and possibly sent back to their home countries			1
the surge of undocumented youths from @entity26 has overwhelmed federal facilities and revived the debate over an immigration policy overhaul , one of the most partisan issues in the already overheated political climate of an election year			0
@entity35 authorities estimate that between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the @entity1 is calling an " immediate humanitarian crisis			2
" @entity2 administration officials blame the immigrant influx on dire conditions in countries such as @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 that cause people to send their children on dangerous journeys to the @entity35 with smugglers who falsely promise the kids wo n't get deported			1
critics , however , say the administration invited the problem by halting deportations of some young immigrants who came to the country illegally in past years			0
funding request @entity2 's emergency funding request is just over 10 % of the $ 30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the @entity63 - passed immigration reform bill that @entity1 @entity9 leaders have stalled			1
a breakdown of the request , which requires approval from the deeply divided @entity3 , shows a broad approach by the administration to a problem that the critics say should have been anticipated			1
it seeks $ 1.6 billion for the @entity73 and the @entity74 to bolster customs and border efforts as well as cracking down on smugglers , and $ 300 million for the @entity78 to help @entity80 and @entity26 governments counter what officials called " misinformation " by smugglers about what immigrants will face on the journey to the @entity35 border and once they arrive			2
a main goal is to speed up the processing of arriving young immigrants to send back those who lack legal status			0
for most , the likely outcome will be a return home , @entity1 officials told reporters on a conference call			0
@entity2 's funding request also seeks $ 1.8 billion for the @entity99 to provide appropriate care for unaccompanied children crossing the border			1
the officials said that money would allow the government to meet its legal and moral obligations for such youngsters now being crammed in overcrowded facilities in several states while awaiting processing			2
on tuesday , the @entity111 said it was processing requests from @entity99 to house more minors and @entity111 spokesman rear adm. @entity114 said the matter was still under discussion			2
but @entity35 officials told @entity0 's @entity118 the requests cover about 5,000 new beds at military facilities			1
there currently is space for about 3,600 children			0
the current arrangement is to use military facilities for up to 120 days			0
@entity114 would n't speculate whether the time frame would be extended , although he said it 's something that would be discussed			0
" @entity129 situation " in addition , the emergency funding request for the rest of fiscal year 2014 , which ends on september 30 , seeks an additional $ 615 million to ensure necessary money to fight wildfires -- an issue separate from the immigration matter			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity138 said the " urgent situation " that the emergency appropriation request would address should usurp any talk of making budget cuts elsewhere to offset the cost			0
" with an emergency request like this , traditionally @entity3 has not sought to bog down that process in a search for offsets , " he told reporters on tuesday			1
the administration also will seek more leeway under existing law to speed up the processing of the undocumented newcomers who are overcrowding holding facilities and sparking protests in communities intended as temporary destinations			0
in particular , it wants @entity3 to make it easier for the @entity73 to deport new immigrants who lack legal standing to remain in the country , which would ease a growing backlog of cases resulting from the influx , @entity138 said			2
" what we are seeing along the @entity170 border is a spike in illegal migration from a handful of @entity26 countries , " he added			0
" and what we would like is for the secretary of homeland security to exercise some greater discretion after the due process rights of those individuals has been acknowledged and respected			0
" partisan divide it was unclear how much cooperation @entity2 would get from congressional @entity9			2
a spokesman for @entity1 speaker @entity184 said the request would be considered , but noted it lacked a component sought by the @entity9 leader			0
" the speaker still supports deploying the @entity190 to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas - which this proposal does not address , " said @entity189			0
on the @entity63 side , @entity9 argued for changing a 2008 law signed by @entity9 president @entity196 that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from non-bordering countries			2
they blame the process for a backlog created by the surge in unaccompanied minors from @entity26 entering the @entity35 illegally from @entity80			0
" i do n't think we can solve the problem unless we revisit " the law , said conservative @entity204 sen. @entity204 of @entity8			2
democrats , however , want to keep the law intact to ensure that any children who deserve asylum get due process in the form of a full hearing			0
" i 'm not inclined to support any policy change that ultimately undermines existing law and would violate the right of someone who is actually a legitimate refugee , " said sen. @entity215 of @entity216 , a @entity217 of @entity219 descent who chairs the @entity221			0
" each child should be able to make their case as to why they qualify			0
many will be sent back but others will qualify			0
" no border visit @entity2 has come under criticism from @entity9 and some @entity208 for not planning to visit the border area during his @entity8 trip , which will include a @entity208 fundraising event			1
former @entity238 gov. @entity237 , a possible @entity9 presidential nominee in 2016 , called the situation similar to the much - disparaged federal response to @entity241 by the @entity196 administration			0
" for him to go to @entity8 and spend two days shaking down donors and never even getting near the border mess he helped create would be like flying into @entity246 in the highest waters of @entity241 to eat @entity249 cooking , but never getting near the @entity250 , the @entity251 , or the @entity252 where thousands languished in squalor , " @entity237 said			1
meanwhile , @entity208 rep. @entity255 of @entity8 questioned if the border problem would harm the president in the same way the @entity241 response tarnished his predecessor , telling @entity261 : " i hope this does not become @entity2 's ' @entity241 moment			1
' " the @entity1 officials on tuesday 's conference call repeatedly emphasized that @entity2 regarded the immigration crisis as " an urgent humanitarian situation			1
" political squabble @entity2 's trip to @entity8 set off a political squabble , with @entity15 refusing to greet the president at the airport and instead calling for a meeting to discuss the immigration crisis			1
in response , @entity2 invited @entity15 to a meeting in @entity277 with faith leaders and local officials , according to a letter written by senior adviser @entity281			1
@entity15 , who is seeking to re-establish his national credentials after a disastrous bid for the @entity9 presidential nomination in 2012 , said tuesday he looked forward to meeting with @entity2			1
previously , @entity15 has said he " readily " welcomes any federal emergency funds , but also has asked that @entity8 be reimbursed for more than $ 500 million the state has spent on border security over the past decade			1
secretary of homeland security @entity288 said sunday the administration will take steps to fix the nation 's broken immigration system , even without the help of @entity3			1
that 's the same message @entity2 has given in response to the refusal by @entity298 to take up a @entity63 - passed immigration reform bill			2
5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis what @entity2 can and ca n't do on immigration @entity0 's @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity310 in @entity311 .			1
