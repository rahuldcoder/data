@entity0 , who took @entity13 to the @entity14 , has signed a two - year deal at the @entity16			1
he will take charge of a side which romped to the @entity20 title last season with a record points tally , but suffered a crushing humiliation in the semifinals of the @entity25 , going down 7 - 0 on aggregate to eventual winners @entity27			0
it led to suggestions that @entity2 needed to make tactical changes , having gone out at the same stage of the competition for the past two years , but @entity0 believes it will not need a major revamp			2
" every team , even @entity2 which has already attained certain moments of excellence , can always improve , and @entity2 still has things to win , " he told gathered reporters			2

" we are not thinking of selling @entity59 , " he said			0
" that @entity62 are showing interest in @entity59 is normal , because he 's a great player			2
" that does n't upset us , that makes us proud that they want one of our players			0
" but whatever the offer , we wo n't be selling him			0
we are relying on him			0
" @entity0 's appointment tuesday came as a surprise as he has no managerial experience in @entity9			2
but his pedigree is clear , winning four championship titles in @entity89 , before guiding their national team to the quarterfinals of the @entity93			0
