-- with the advent of " cyberwar , " a poorly defined term that seems to be used as a catch - all phrase for all manners of computer - related attacks , it 's natural to ask about cyber arms control			1
@entity10 , former cybersecurity adviser to president @entity11 , has advocated along with others for cyber arms control or new legal rules for war in cyberspace			1
if governments have the ability to build the tools of cyberwarfare , then presumably , they can regulate and control them			1
but realistically , it 's unlikely that cyber arms control will happen anytime soon			1
when we think of arms control , we consider the efforts of the @entity27 , which dramatically cut the number of nuclear weapons and other strategic armaments , from the period of detente to the eventual collapse of the @entity34			1
arms control works fairly well for managing the arsenals of weapons that are large and complex			1
however , cyberweapons are of a different league			2
all you need is training in computer software engineering and some talent			2
on the @entity45 , there is readily available literature on coding and hacking , and of course , a plethora of open source tools			2
just as easy as it is to be an effective cyberdefender , you can learn to be an effective offensive cyber-operator			0
cyber attacks can be crafted and used by individuals or groups			1
importantly , they can make impact even without significant involvement from a nation			1
for example , the @entity63 hacker group is able to disrupt major corporations and even countries with its campaigns for transparency			0
furthermore , when @entity63 is unable to disrupt a target , it typically resorts to overtaking websites with massive denial of service attacks			0
despite the role of nonstate players , it is the brinkmanship between countries in cyberspace that make the big headlines			0
@entity80 , a cybersecurity company , reported a series of cyber attacks on @entity84 companies that was traced to @entity87 's @entity86 unit 61398 based in @entity88			1
one of the lessons in the analysis is how remarkably effective the @entity87 attackers were despite a stunning lack of sophistication and sloppiness in their tradecraft			0
in contrast , our biggest and most innovative corporations have developed and deployed sophisticated defense systems that still seem to be regularly breached , despite the efforts of their comically inept adversaries			0
if the @entity87 pla ever gets its act together , we 're in real trouble			0
how might this get worse ? we already know that cyber-espionage can harm companies			0
the risks of cybersabotage can be worse			0
for example , industrial control systems are largely computer controlled and they can be reached in some cases from the @entity45			1
future terrorist organizations could cause spectacular physical and economic damage to our refineries , power plants , water systems , pipelines and other important systems without leaving a marked trail or suffering significant personal risk			0
in the wake of the @entity124 attacks on @entity126 's uranium - refinement centrifuges or the @entity128 attack on @entity130 's computers , cybersabotage can no longer be considered theoretical			1
it 's not difficult to imagine a future in which cyber attacks become more frequent or serious			1
in such a world , there will be a need for diplomacy and norm - setting among the international community			1
but if we ever wanted to consider treaties on cyber disarmament , or regulations on the use of hacking tools by those wishing to do more than simply spy or steal , we would become immediately stymied by how to enforce the rules			2
barring a radical change in the technological playing field , there will never be an effective cyber equivalent of the @entity153 despite all the aspirations of organizations like the @entity156 to serve such a function			2
the very idea that an international organization could enforce rules on the misuse of computers is ludicrous			0
the problem of cyber arms control is akin to the greatest arms control failure of the @entity27 , which still persists : the mass distribution of the most produced firearm in human history , the @entity169			1
according to the @entity171 , as many as 100 million of these brutally simple weapons are scattered across the globe ( roughly one for every 70 people on the planet , and that excludes the millions of @entity177 military rifles out there , too )			0
from every major trouble spot , we see footage of kalashnikov - wielding soldiers , terrorists and rebels			0
@entity184 attempts to sweep up such weapons , as well as their bigger and more volatile relatives -- rocket - propelled grenades -- have been mostly ineffective			0
the @entity188 has worked for more than a decade on an arms trade treaty designed to limit the illicit trade of such weapons , but a final draft of the treaty is stalled			2
for better or for worse , the @entity45 has become one more field upon which the game of nations is played			2
just as the internet can be used for sharing information and enabling commerce , it can also be used to steal secrets and to cause damage			0
in the short term , we might see private industry adopt defensive practices			0
in the long term , while we may never be able to eliminate electronic espionage , we may be able to reduce its reach through vigilance and diplomacy			2
as for cyber arms control , forget about it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 and @entity217 .			1

@entity216 , @entity217 : cyber arms control is unlikely to happen soon
@entity216 , @entity217 : **cyberattacks** can be crafted and *launched* by individuals , groups
they say nations do *n't* even have to be involved for an attack to have impact
@entity216 , @entity217 : it 's hard to get *rid* of **cyberattacks** , but they can be curbed with diplomacy
