-- singing folk songs and strumming the guitar at his campaign rallies , @entity1 shows no sign that he 's facing the strongest challenge to his 13 - year rule in @entity8			1
he has dismissed his much younger challenger , @entity9 , as a " fly " not worth chasing , when challenged to a debate earlier this year			1
@entity1 's opponents are confident that this sunday , @entity9 will unseat the long - ruling leftist leader , a refrain previously heard before eventual defeats			1
yet the incumbent is a political survivor and remains popular at home			0
but there are signals , observers say , that this time @entity1 really is on the ropes			1
@entity1 's influence over @entity23 's left - leaning governments has often rankled the @entity24 , @entity8 's largest trading partner			1
@entity8 is the fourth - largest exporter of oil to the @entity24			1
despite that tight economic relationship , the two countries are not exactly close allies : @entity1 often rails against the @entity24 and its allies as " imperialists			2
" @entity1 on @entity24 election further complicating the @entity24 - @entity8 relationship , @entity1 is allied with @entity35 's @entity34 , he defended former @entity37 leader @entity36 and he has even offered his support for @entity40 's leader @entity39			1
at stake for @entity8 is the ideological trajectory of their country			2
@entity1 , 58 , has had more than a decade to implement his vision of 21st century socialism , a view that emphasizes use of state oil windfalls to fund social programs			2
observers say @entity9 , 40 , represents a moderate alternative			1
he has vowed not end the social programs that @entity1 has set up , and he promises to fight corruption that has grown in the public sector			2
the candidates offer two distinct paths to solve the problems that are on @entity8 minds : decaying infrastructure , high crime rates and political polarization			2
candidates hold dueling rallies a close race ? as expected , both sides claim they will be victorious -- and both sides have polls to back up those claims			0
several polls gave @entity1 a double - digit lead , while at least one gave @entity9 a narrow lead			1
@entity1 supporters say the majority of polls were clear			2
those supporting @entity9 say people were afraid to voice their real opinions			2
" the information we get from the polls is , at best , confusing , " said @entity78 , a political analyst and retired professor at @entity80			0
part of the problem is " an inherent bias in polling companies , " according to @entity85 , a @entity8 professor of politics at the @entity87 in @entity88 , who has taken a closer look at the pollsters			2
@entity9 , he noted , also must believe it is a close race , as evidenced by a speech this summer in which he spoke directly to the military , assuring them and other institutions that things will be ok if he wins			2
that address was significant because questions exist about whether the military , whose leadership ranks is stacked with @entity1 loyalists , will accept a defeat			2
2 killed as @entity8 campaign turns violent controlling for biases , there are two conclusions that @entity85 has drawn from the polls : that @entity1 is " stuck " with support near -- but not quite at -- 50 % , and that @entity9 is closing the gap			1
" we 're looking at a long night on october 7 because things look closer than polls or the government make it seem , " he said			0
@entity1 , cool and hip new campaign posters for @entity1 have featured him popping a wheelie on a motorcycle , playing basketball and even performing as a rap artist			2
it 's a sharp contrast with the image of a sick man who was diagnosed with cancer last year and underwent two surgeries , in addition to multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatments			0
the image makeover is part of an effort to capture support for @entity1 among @entity8 's undecided voters -- mostly young people -- who make up 23 % of the electorate and could play a pivotal role in sunday 's election			1
neither @entity1 nor anyone in his government have publicly discussed what kind of cancer he has			2
he recently objected to a reporter 's question about his health			0
" here i am , and every day , i feel in better physical condition , " the president said			0
" and i firmly believe , that that expression about physical limitations that you used , it 's not going to be a factor in this campaign			0
" crafting a youthful image is also important because @entity1 is 18 years older than his political rival , who turned 40 over the summer			1
" @entity8 are looking for a new way , " @entity9 has told his supporters			1
" it 's been 14 years of the same government			0
this government has already completed its cycle and has nothing more to offer			0
they 're only recycling promises			0
" @entity1 , presumably because of his health , has not held as many rallies or traveled as often as he has in previous campaigns			2
his re-election effort has been mostly through presidential addresses that state - run television stations are mandated to carry			0
@entity1 would have been unable to run for re-election this year because of constitutional limits			1
but his @entity177 of @entity8 pushed for a referendum in 2009 in which voters eliminated term limits			1
winning another term in office next month would allow @entity1 to rule @entity8 until 2019 , the 20th anniversary of his rise to power			1
whatever his health condition , @entity1 remains a force in @entity8 politics			1
his likeness is everywhere -- on television , on huge banners and the radio			0
his popularity remains high among @entity8 , and his supporters remain as ardent as ever			0
however , @entity9 has been constantly on the road , and his supporters say the momentum is shifting			0
" we see it everyday , people are opening up their doors and inviting us in , " said @entity197 , secretary - general of @entity199 party			0
with high stakes , accusations fly the campaign has heated up in the final stretch , with accusations of improprieties flying back and forth			0
in the past month , the @entity9 ' campaign has accused @entity1 of using a televised presidential address to bump an opposition campaign event from the airwaves			1
and the @entity1 campaign released hidden - camera footage that purportedly showed one of @entity9 ' campaign leaders accepting a bribe			1
" there are definitely moments of tension , " said @entity78 , the retired professor at @entity80			0
that tension has also erupted into violence at several campaign rallies			0
on saturday , gunmen reportedly killed three @entity227 activists in the western @entity8 state of @entity229			0
earlier this month , in the port city of @entity231 , a group of people identified as @entity1 supporters -- also known as " @entity235 " -- threw rocks as @entity9 made his way to a campaign rally			1
several people were injured in an ensuing clash between the two sides			0
@entity199 party has accused the ruling party of harassment during the campaign , particularly when the @entity1 campaign released a hidden - camera video showing a lawmaker working on @entity9 ' campaign accepting cash from a businessman			1
@entity1 's campaign said the money purportedly was a bribe for his opponents campaign and accused the @entity9 camp of financing itself in this way			1
@entity9 responded to the video by firing the lawmaker and joining in the government 's call for an investigation			0
" it 's a very difficult environment we are campaigning in , " said @entity197 of @entity199 party			0
he characterized the harassment of the opposition campaign as acts of desperation from the ruling party			0
" it 's the agenda of someone who is defeated , " he said			0
representatives from @entity1 's campaign declined to comment , but @entity1 told reporters last week that a @entity9 victory was impossible , citing polls			1
" we are ready for the will of the people to be respected and for no one to come and disrespect the @entity8 will , " @entity1 said			1
meanwhile , a former minister and vice president under @entity1 , @entity280 , accused the opposition of being capable of a coup or economic sabotage , if they lose			2
the back - and - forth accusations can only mean one thing , according to analyst @entity85 : " all the shenanigans that have been happening point in the direction that the government knows that things are close			0
" the biggest question mark for observers abroad is whether the election will bring instability to @entity8 no matter who wins			1
former @entity24 ambassador to @entity8 , @entity297 , said unrest is not inevitable , but in an analysis for the @entity300 , laid out several scenarios of concern , beginning with the fact that " @entity1 and several of his most senior associates have asserted that there will be instability and violence if he is not re-elected			1
" violence could break out if it appears @entity1 is going to lose , if he dies unexpectedly or if he wins with the appearance of cheating , @entity308 wrote			0
" although @entity1 has indicated he will respect the results of the election , most plausible scenarios for instability and conflict in @entity8 derive from the premise that the @entity235 will not willingly surrender power and would be willing to provoke violence , orchestrate civil unrest or engage in various forms of armed resistance to avoid doing so , " @entity308 said			1
@entity1 opponent wants to be a uniter journalist @entity325 and @entity0 's @entity326 contributed to this report .			0

on sunday , @entity8 will vote for president
@entity331 leader @entity1 is vying for a fourth term
his challenger is 40 - year - old @entity9
observers have expressed concern about *post-election* instability
