-- with his opinion for a narrow majority of the @entity8 , upholding major provisions of the @entity10 , chief justice @entity11 has , for the first time since his confirmation as chief justice in 2005 , breached the gap between the conservative and liberal wings of the court on a polarizing political issue			1
news : legal scholars unsurprised by @entity11 in doing so , he has jettisoned his reputation as a predictable conservative vote on controversial issues , such as campaign finance reform and affirmative action , that have been decided by a divided court			1
@entity11 , in finding the critical provisions of the @entity10 constitutional , has followed the example of his predecessor , chief justice @entity28 , who led the court during the tumultuous constitutional battles over president @entity33 's @entity32 legislation			1
@entity28 , like @entity11 , sometimes found narrow grounds to uphold @entity32 legislation and , as a result , cautiously steered the court away from the public perception that justices voted according to their political values , not constitutional principle			2
chief justice @entity28 , and now @entity11 , demonstrated that they placed a high value on projecting the image of the court as a nonpartisan judicial institution that upholds the rule of law and is above partisan politics			1
@entity28 skillfully worked to promote the court 's public image as nonpartisan , not just in his narrow opinions , but , dramatically , in defending the justices against @entity33 's attacks and his court - packing plan			1
later , in grudging admiration , @entity33 said that @entity28 was " the best politician in the country			0
" that was hardly the way @entity28 would have chosen to be remembered , but there was much truth in the president 's remark			0
in june 2012 it may be said that chief justice roberts , like @entity28 , has employed political as well as judicial skills in his role as the leader of the @entity8			2
news : emotions high after @entity8 upholds health care law @entity11 surprised almost everybody , including constitutional pundits and members of the @entity77 administration , when he announced thursday 's decision upholding the @entity10 's most controversial provision , the individual mandate , under @entity82 ' power to tax			0
judges on the lower federal courts who passed judgment on the @entity10 , as well as both the challengers and defenders of the law in the @entity90 , focused their arguments on @entity82 ' authority to regulate interstate commerce			0
the chief justice , after rejecting the administration 's commerce clause argument , turned to the more general power of @entity82 to tax			2
and tellingly , he declared that the court was obligated to uphold a law as constitutional if there were reasonable grounds to do so , even if there were alternative grounds to strike it down			0
in this respect , the chief justice 's opinion was a model of judicial restraint , a term that has not frequently been used to describe the @entity11 court			1
the chief justice pointedly wrote that the court did not pass judgment on the wisdom of the law , only its constitutionality			2
the distinction @entity11 made between what may be wise , or even good public policy , and what the @entity120 allows , has always been a hallmark of judicial restraint			0
when the @entity28 court in the 1930s , led by four ideological conservatives , struck down major pillars of the @entity32 , dissenters accused the justices in the majority of substituting their political judgment for that of popularly elected branches of the federal government			0
news : by the numbers : health care insurance though chief justice @entity28 sometimes voted with the court conservatives , he demonstrated , time and again , that he understood the distinction between the role of the political branches of the federal government and that of the court , which is obligated only to rule on the constitutionality of a statute			1
today , chief justice roberts , like @entity28 ( whom he is known to admire ) , has again struck a blow for judicial restraint and integrity			2
as a result of thursday 's decision , the ultimate fate of the @entity10 does not reside with a majority of the life - tenured members of the court , but with the political branches of federal government and the @entity162 voters			1
in a representative democracy , this is exactly where the responsibility should be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity168 : chief justice breached gap between court 's conservative , liberal wings
he says @entity11 *upended* reputation as predictable conservative , like a predecessor
he says @entity33 - era chief justice @entity28 also kept politics out of decisions
@entity168 : @entity11 left fate of law with political branches and voters , where it belongs
