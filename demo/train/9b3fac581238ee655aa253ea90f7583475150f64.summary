@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 said wednesday it is increasing its nationwide monitoring of radiation in milk , precipitation , drinking water , and other outlets in response to the ongoing nuclear crisis in @entity12			1
the @entity2 already monitors radiation in those potential exposure routes through an existing network of monitoring stations across the country			1
results from a screening sample of milk taken march 25 in @entity21 , @entity0 , detected radioactive iodine at a level 5,000 times lower than the limit set by the @entity25 , the @entity2 said			1
the @entity27 isotope has a very short half - life of about eight days , the @entity2 said , so the level detected in milk and milk products is expected to drop relatively quickly			1
the tests confirm that the milk is safe to drink , @entity0 gov. @entity32 said			1
" this morning i spoke with the chief advisers for both the @entity2 and the @entity25 and they confirmed that these levels are miniscule and are far below levels of public health concern , including for infants and children , " @entity32 said in a statement			2
" according to them , a pint of milk at these levels would expose an individual to less radiation than would a five - hour airplane flight			2
" @entity25 senior scientist @entity48 also said the findings are " miniscule " compared to what people experience every day			0
at least 15 states have reported radioisotopes from @entity12 's crippled @entity55 nuclear plant in air or water or both			0
no states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide , a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine			0
@entity27 has been found in eastern states from @entity66 to @entity67 as well as in western states like @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 , according to sensors and officials in those states			0
none of the levels poses a risk to public health , they said			0
the @entity12 plant has been leaking radiation since it was damaged in the earthquake and resulting tsunami earlier this month .			0

the @entity2 is increasing monitoring nationwide
it is monitoring milk , precipitation , drinking water , and other outlets
a milk sample from @entity0 shows " miniscule " *amounts* of radiation
tests confirm the milk is safe to drink , *governor* says
