-- the @entity2 administration is sending letters to all 50 states warning that it will limit road construction spending beginning august 1 unless @entity7 acts to fund a dwindling federal trust fund that helps pay for such projects			1
for motorists , that could mean everything from renewed encounters with axle - crunching potholes to more congestion as traffic is managed more tightly on outdated bridges			1
for state and local governments , it means juggling infrastructure maintenance and upgrades with an unsteady source of funds to carry out those priorities			2
like the situation involving many of the roads nationwide awaiting attention , there is nothing new going on here			0
the on - and - off legislative wrangling over related construction spending is another year older and like a lot of other things caught up in bitter partisan politicking in @entity37 , no closer to a resolution			2
@entity2 makes new pitch president @entity2 aimed on tuesday ahead of the july 4 holiday travel period to make another pitch for @entity7 to boost investment in infrastructure spending to address pressing highway and transit needs and spur job creation			1
@entity2 proposed a long - term highway construction bill earlier this year			1
other lawmakers have their own plans as well			0
some are calling for a hike in gas taxes to help pay for federal transportation priorities			1
others would like to see less government involvement and spending , and more private financing and creative financing approaches			1
the current two - year law allowing the government to send from the trust fund expires in september , a deadline that can be extended if more money is found			1
this is how road funding works now : motorists pay gasoline taxes each time they go to the pump			2
the federal portion -- just over 18 cents per gallon -- goes into an account called the @entity71			2
the money is mainly dedicated to projects spearheaded by individual states			2
these can include that highway widening job , repairing curbs on @entity78 , and replacing a rusting bridge			2
over the years , the trust fund balance has gone down sharply			1
the recession and high gas prices were blamed for people driving a lot less and the push for greater energy independence has led to more fuel efficient cars			0
this all means less money spent on gas and less money collected in related taxes			2
over the years , the trust fund balance has fallen and now there 's concern it will run out of money			1
running low on money the federal highway account started last october with approximately $ 1.6 billion in cash , and then received nearly $ 10 billion more from general tax revenues			0
at the start of june , the balance was roughly $ 8 billion , according to @entity105 figures			0
the @entity105 is now warning states that it will use a different method for distributing money to them once the fund balance dips below $ 4 billion in less than a month			1
normally , they get reimbursed once an invoice is submitted , but now the money will go out as part of a new formula			0
states will instead get two installments in august -- one toward the middle of the month and another at the end			0
at the end of august or early september , the fund will reach zero			0
" i believe this cash management plan is a sound one , " transportation secretary @entity121 wrote to state highway administrators			0
" it treats all states equitably and provides you with as much certainty as we can in an uncertain situation			0
will @entity7 act ? but " there is still time for @entity7 to act on a long - term solution , " @entity121 wrote			1
similar spending for mass transit is also in rough shape , prompting a similar response from federal transportation officials			1
moreover , summer is high season for road construction			1
@entity140 told @entity0 that congressional inaction would mean delays in road repairs â € ” and traffic jams			1
" those potholes that you saw this winter , well we may not be able to see many of those potholes get fixed â € ” or as many of them get fixed , " @entity121 said			0
" but more importantly , i think is that congestion , travel times are lengthening in many parts of the country			0
people are sitting in traffic longer , and the types of solutions that are needed to relieve that congestion are ones that are paid for by the @entity71			0
" @entity0 's @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
