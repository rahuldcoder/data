at first , @entity0 thought her young son 's affinity for wearing dresses , primping his hair and playing with @entity5 and @entity7 dolls indicated he was going through a stage			1
but @entity10 's interest in " girl stuff " has not been short - lived : he 's grown his hair out and has dressed as a girl when he can for much of his 7 years			1
@entity10 's been " outspoken " about his gender identity , said @entity0			1
the @entity15 , @entity16 , family 's recent attempt to sign up @entity10 with @entity19 , however , left him in tears , his mother said			1
a leader said he could not join because of his " boy parts , " @entity0 told @entity24 affiliate @entity23			1
the @entity19 of @entity16 has since said it was an " inclusive " organization and " if a child lives life as a girl " he or she is welcome to join			1
" when a family requests membership for their daughter , we do not require proof of gender , we respect the decisions of families			1
" @entity0 does n't label her son , who has been bullied and taunted			2
" i consider @entity10 to be born in the wrong body			2
" the @entity16 case has brought to light questions about labels and the rapidly evolving discussion about gender non-conforming children			1
" a person is going to be who they are going to be , " said @entity47 - based family therapist @entity46			1
" these children are operating in a hostile environment			2
as a parent , you are navigating a child in two poles -- authentic to their feelings , the other being on the brunt end of ill treatment			2
" despite the uphill battle , psychologists and therapists speak of a " sea change " toward growing acceptance of children who do n't meet long - held cultural norms			1
and , they point out , families have more resources to learn about gender variance , including websites and peer and support groups			1
it can be a complicated discussion , especially when terms like tomgirl , gender fluid or transgender are bandied about			1
the terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably , particularly on official forms , but sociologists say they are not the same thing			1
sex refers to biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women			0
gender refers to socially constructed roles and behaviors society considers appropriate for men and women			1
gender identity and sexual orientation also are different			1
sexual orientation refers to an individual 's enduring physical , romantic , and / or emotional attraction to another person , whereas gender identity refers to one 's internal sense of being male , female , or something else , according to the @entity103			1
transgender children and adults are " people who are being assigned one gender but affirm that they are the other , " said @entity109 , a @entity110 developmental and clinical psychologist and author of " @entity112			1
" there is little consistent advice for parents , because robust data and studies about transgender children are rare			1
the rates of people who are transgender vary from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 1,000 , depending on various international studies			0
gender non-conforming children who do not receive support from their families are at higher risk for mental health issues , attempted suicide and drug use , said real , citing research at the @entity131			1
in some cases , parents should strongly consider working with a gender - sensitive therapist , he said			1
" they have experience in helping a child and parent with difficult decisions , " @entity46 said			0
" things like disclosure , how do you talk about it , do you wear your hair long			0
... it is the responsibility of the parent to deal with the needs of this child			0
there are minute - to - minute questions			1
" the @entity131 , based at @entity152 , has produced videos to support families of transgender children			0
research has shown that a high proportion of lesbians , gays and bisexuals are gender non-conforming , said @entity162 , director of the center			1
people can be gender non-conforming and heterosexual , she adds			1
@entity167 said parents of non-conforming children should learn more about neighborhood schools			1
" parents need to find out what the school policies are , " @entity167 said			1
" do the teachers have training ? is the school environment overall supportive ? " but experts also said parents must be prudent			1
" in some cultures it may not be safe to send your boy to a school in a dress			1
you can work with schools , " said @entity109			0
' " support would be to tell the child it is an unfair world and there may be some places it is not safe to be who you want to be			0
it is not your fault , it is their fault			0
" @entity200 , a writer and activist in the @entity110 , blogs about " parenting a boy who is different			2
" the writer , who said she uses a pseudonym to protect the safety of her family , said her son , @entity206 , 9 , represents the gender spectrum -- one foot in the masculine world , one foot in the feminine			2
for that , she said , her son has endured bullying			0
@entity206 sees himself as a boy but has liked tiaras and dresses , @entity200 said			1
while he has long hair , @entity206 now usually wears masculine clothes			0
" he is just a mix , " @entity200 told @entity24			0
" the problem is not our kids , " @entity200 said			0
" the problem is our culture not accepting kids			0
" @entity200 said some readers have called her a weak parent for letting @entity206 express himself			0
@entity109 said she has received e-mails from critics telling her to read the @entity229 and " see @entity231 's way			2
" @entity109 and @entity167 said they have assisted people who are socially and religiously conservative			0
" we help them balance their beliefs with what is happening with their child , " said @entity167			0
in general , fathers have a harder time accepting gender variance than mothers , experts say			1
and the culture more often raises eyebrows when a boy dresses as a girl than when a girl looks masculine			1
" girls have more license to express a range of gender presentations until they get into junior high , " said @entity167			2
by then , they are expected to be interested in boys			0
the researcher and others stress the importance of parents paying close attention to children showing gender non-conformity			1
" they know what feels right to them			0
they know what clothes they want to wear , " @entity167 said			0
" they very clearly know who they are			0
" parents need to be careful not to rush to a diagnosis and predict a child 's eventual sexual orientation or gender identity , experts said			1
for example , a child dressed in drag may be depressed and looking for attention -- but not have a gender issue			2
" you have to live in a state of not knowing for a while , " said @entity167			0
" they are exploring their gender			2
the most important thing is to give them space for exploration			0
if you categorize them at age 3 , that could be a big mistake			0
" families also should be aware of what may lie ahead , @entity296 said			0
there could be discussion of delayed puberty and hormone therapy to decrease certain anatomical attributes			0
@entity304 , director of education and training at @entity306 , which promotes an " inclusive environment , " said " more and more families are seeing their children express themselves a little differently from what others believe			0
they are kind of saying , ' i am going to see where this goes			0
' " " we do n't talk about the damage we do when we do n't allow a kid to explore this aspect of self , " @entity304 said			0
not everyone is happy with that approach			0
@entity320 , executive director of @entity321 , a group that works with people who no longer practice gay , lesbian or transgender lifestyles , said of transgender individuals : " if they are n't helped to celebrate their true gender they will be confused			2
" gender confusion can be sign of a treatable mental disorder , according to @entity320			2
the @entity335 is reviewing its current definition of gender identity disorder			2
whether a person has a disorder is dependent on how much mental distress it causes , according to the @entity342 , composed of doctors , psychologists and others professionals			0
simply dressing in a non-traditional way does not mean the person has a disorder			0
@entity109 stressed parents need to become resilient to critics			2
" i 'm not letting my child do something , " parents might state , she says			2
" i am listening to who my child is			0
" @entity0 , who has two older children , said @entity10 is still interested in joining the @entity19 , but not the same unit he first came in contact with			1
the @entity19 of @entity16 is taking such situations " on a case by case basis , " said spokesperson @entity361			1
" this is a pretty new thing for us			0
" " i have absolutely heard of many situations of transgender kids who are absolutely living as a girl			2
girl scouts should n't be any different for them , " she said			1
@entity0 said her son does n't need counseling and does not the dress the way he does because of his environment			0
" i know it 's going to be a really hard road for @entity10 , " @entity0 said			2
" i feel if we are there for him , we will get through it together			0

a 7 - year - old @entity16 boy who dresses as a girl wants to join the @entity19
he initially met *resistance* ; the scouts now say he is welcome
experts see a sea change in society 's thoughts on gender non-conformity
they offer resources and advice for parents
