-- @entity1 expands access to health insurance for tens of millions of people come january 1			1
dental care for adults , however , is not included , and experts say we 've got a potential oral health care crisis coming			1
studies show that people who have insurance are more likely to get regular dental care			1
but only about 2 % of older @entity14 have dental insurance of any kind , according to a new report			1
" until we have an expansion of this kind of coverage , and until we have people really recognizing what this means for their overall health , i do believe we have an unimaginable tragedy on our hands , " said @entity18 , president and ceo of @entity20			0
@entity32 's organization published the report " state of decay : are older @entity14 coming of age without oral health care ? " which shows that baby boomers -- who have , for the most part , kept their natural teeth -- could be facing some serious oral health problems over the next decade			1
people with low income and racial and ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable , according to the report			0
how brushing your teeth lowers your risk of cancer " it 's an issue that is particularly important that is not always talked about , " said @entity50 , dean emeritus of the @entity51			0
" people in the @entity14 are retaining their teeth , and as a result , teeth that have been in use for 50 or 60 or 70 years will have problems			2
" neither @entity60 nor the @entity1 includes adult dental coverage , although some pediatric dental care is covered			1
even the @entity64 insurance that adults buy to expand their plans ' benefits still wo n't cover dental procedures			1
less than 1 % of dental services are covered by @entity60			1
and neglected dental health can turn into even bigger medical issues			2
" for instance , if you have diabetes and you have gum disease , your metabolic control will be worse , " @entity50 said			0
" there is a lot of data showing that periodontal disease can increase your risk for heart attacks and strokes			0
there are so many ways this can impact your overall health			0
that is why regular access to care is so important			2
" the study put together by @entity20 ranked states in terms of the oral care their populations receive			2
seventeen states received a " poor " grade			0
the states were evaluated on edentulism , which is the fancy word for total loss of teeth			0
other factors included community water fluoridation , adult @entity106 coverage , access to dentists and a state oral health plan that addresses older adults			1
some states ' medicaid programs cover adult dental care			1
however , of the 17 states that received a " poor " grade for dental care , the majority are led by @entity119 governors who have refused or are leaning against expanding @entity106 under the @entity1			1
dental screening that could save your life @entity123 is ranked the worst			2
@entity124 and @entity125 tied for second to last			0
the other states rated as " poor " are @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			0
" some of this ' poor ' care is in direct relation to the economic changes our country has experienced , " @entity32 said			2
" a lot of it , though , stems from the fact that some people see this as a tangential kind of medical care			2
" emergency room visits for dental health have doubled from about a decade ago			1
in 1999 - 2000 , there were a reported 1 million cases of adults over 65 who went to the er for dental problems ; in 2009 - 10 , there were 2.3 million cases			1
" dental care is extremely expensive , and the older adult will require the more extensive care , " @entity50 said			1
" the frustrating part is that we have some great technology now : dental implants , for instance , work remarkably well , but they are beyond the means of much of the population			0
" @entity175 's teeth : what you should know not all states fared as badly in the report			0
@entity180 ranked at the top of the list , with @entity183 a close second			0
" we wanted to show that there are states that are getting close to having a model kind of care that others could replicate , " @entity32 said			0
according to the report , @entity180 ranks high in terms of communities with fluoridated water , a @entity106 program that covers dental care for adults , a state oral health plan that addresses this population and , perhaps consequently , a low rate of edentulism			1
the report suggests that @entity180 still needs more dentists to serve its population			0
there is some good news : the number of federally qualified health centers that provide dental care have increased , and 41 of 50 states have state oral health plans			1
there is also a bill in @entity213 that would widen the @entity1 , @entity60 , @entity106 and veterans benefits to include dental health			1
that legislation , though , is in its very early stages			0
the @entity20 also put together a website toothwisdom.org that offers a handy guide on where you can find dental care in your state			2
it even gives suggestion on transportation options to these caregivers if an older person is unable to drive			0
@entity229 offers funding to help communities understand			0

only about 2 % of older adults have dental insurance
emergency room visits *due* to dental problems more than doubled in the past decade
@entity1 , @entity60 do not cover dental care for adults
