-- as @entity3 president @entity2 visited the @entity4 in @entity5 last month , the spotlight was once again on @entity3			0
and true to form , the @entity3 president made his fair share of provocative statements for the @entity11 media			0
but while @entity2 's mercurial rants captured our media 's attention , back in @entity3 a coordinated strategy against the women 's movement continued			2
on the eve of @entity2 's arrival to @entity5 , @entity20 , a prominent young female defender of human rights , received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of " waging war against @entity28 " -- a convenient catch - all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record			1
there 's no denying it -- @entity3 's women have had a bad year			2
@entity20 joins a steadily increasing number of other women 's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women			1
@entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 have all been sent to @entity51 's notorious @entity50 on trumped - up charges related to their activism			0
and while @entity56 laureate @entity55 , arguably the most internationally recognized @entity3 women 's rights activist , remains unable to safely return to her country , the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment , including her lawyer @entity62 and her former aide @entity63			1
since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement , the government has increasingly targeted women activists			2
the reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of @entity3 's religious leadership			0
rather , it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the @entity3 authorities to strike at the heart of the regime 's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people			2
see more @entity0 opinion articles @entity3 's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in @entity3 for more than a decade			1
one can roughly draw an analogy between the women 's movement in @entity3 to movements of religious groups in @entity92 or @entity93 , or the labor " solidarity " movements in the former @entity96 and associated labor - @entity98 solidarity in @entity99 -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress			1
while the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of @entity3 's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with @entity112 , an @entity3 widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime 's archaic viewpoint about gender			2
however , the government 's direct targeting of women goes beyond chauvinism and is an integral part of a strategy to quell any momentum for larger internal reform			1
women activists in @entity3 have worked for years at the ground level to promote internal change			1
although @entity3 's women suffered a significant setback with the imposition of discriminatory laws following the 1979 revolution , an ease in restrictions during @entity138 's presidential term in the late 1990s and early 2000s allowed women to organize around reforms and emerge as a formidable grass - roots force in civil society			0
women - led campaigns to collect signatures in support of reform of gender discriminatory laws and protest the stoning of women formed and grew rapidly , attracting many members and international attention			0
in the years that followed , women were often at the forefront of staging public protests			0
during the presidential election campaign in 2009 , women activists , drawing on their grass roots and organizational experience , played a critical role in shaping and influencing the political platforms of the opposition candidates			0
so when the government set out to suppress the larger civil unrest that broke out in @entity3 's major cities after the election , it set its sights on a perceived catalyst for this unrest -- the well - established women 's movement			1
in the mass indictments issued in august 2009 by @entity51 's prosecutor general , women were identified as an element of an alleged " soft " revolution			0
women 's rights activists report that government interrogators warned them to cease their activities and accused them of supplying the political opposition with organizational and leadership skills and knowledge			1
today the regime continues to systematically target the women 's movement , whose leading campaigners are being silenced , imprisoned and exiled in increasing numbers			2
it 's not sufficient for members of the international community to speak up only occasionally at the most shocking manifestations of the @entity3 regime 's targeting of women			0
rather , a sustained , consistent and broader campaign must be waged that seeks to promote and give voice to the major catalysts of comprehensive human rights progress in @entity3 -- its brave women activists			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			0
