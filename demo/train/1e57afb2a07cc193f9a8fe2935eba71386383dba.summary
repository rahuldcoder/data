@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 factory floor ai n't what it used to be			1
heavy industry machines now sit idle , where once hundreds of workers would have crammed into dickensian sweat shops , slaving away for little pay			2
@entity0 's army of migrant workers are smarter than ever , demanding higher pay and better conditions , armed with tough government labor laws			1
@entity16 has ridden the wave of @entity0 's economic boom and now says the tide is turning			1
" when i first came to @entity0 you had 200 people outside the factory gate trying to get in , " he says			2
" people would ask favors -- ' can you get my cousin a job ? ' now that 's gone and i 'm asking -- ' do you have a cousin who can come help me ? ' " @entity16 is an old - style middle man			1
for two decades he 's matched product - hungry @entity30 companies with @entity4 manufacturers			1
it worked for him , and it worked for the buyer and the supplier			0
but it also left him branded a traitor : an @entity37 helping @entity0 steal @entity37 jobs			1
it 's a catch - cry that 's making a comeback in this @entity37 election year			1
already anti-chinese television commercials are playing to blue - collar fears			1
@entity16 says it is nonsense			2
" @entity0 's not taking these jobs , the jobs have left ... the question is where are they landing ? " he says			1
yes , it is true those jobs landed in their millions in @entity0 , transforming mid-sized towns into booming cities			1
@entity0 became the world 's factory , running up breakneck economic growth			2
but @entity16 says that was another era			2
" @entity0 " is finished			2
increased costs , he says , are just part of the equation			0
the nature of work in @entity0 is changing ; out with the old dirty factory jobs and in with cleaner high - tech industries			1
@entity65 is feeling the brunt of these changes			0
he was once a factory worker himself			0
now he is the boss and simply ca n't find enough staff			0
the orders keep coming , he says , but who will fill them ? " the lack of workers will definitely have an impact on my business			0
we turned down many orders from our clients because we do n't have enough workers to make these products			0
it definitely has a huge impact , " he says			0
while bosses may struggle , for now at least @entity0 's army of migrant workers is reaping the rewards			1
@entity89 , 23 , came here to @entity91 in southern @entity0 from her home province two years ago			0
her first job paid her @entity95 a month , about $ 300			0
now she wants double that and is scouring @entity91 's busy job market to upgrade			0
" i think it 's a matter of improving my ability , " she says			0
there are big factories offering " good salary " and " job training , " she says			0
@entity0 is following a path chartered by the @entity37 a generation ago			1
old industries will fold as it enters a new era of higher paid , smarter work			0
ironically , president @entity111 is leading the call for manufacturing to return stateside			0
it is seen as an answer to @entity37 's stubbornly high unemployment			0
old @entity0 hands like @entity16 say , forget about it			1
" the reality is jobs like this are not coming back to the @entity37 it may be unpleasant , you may say i 'm un-american but it is just the reality of it , " he says			2
but with an election looming , that 's not really a message @entity37 politicians are keen to send to disenchanted voters			2
in meetings in @entity130 with @entity0 's presumptive president , @entity131 , president @entity111 has continued to raise his concerns about @entity0 's economic policies , what he argues is an artificially low currency and unfair export advantage			0
@entity0 's real challenge is to bridge the gap between the old and new industries , between the low paid and better paid , more demanding workers			1
if it fails the task , @entity0 may soon have its own political slogan : " @entity141 is stealing @entity4 jobs ! "			1

one @entity37 middle man in @entity0 says " the jobs have left "
@entity4 workers are demanding better pay , conditions
@entity37 election campaigns are playing to blue - collar fears
jobs wo n't return to the @entity37 , @entity16 says , asking " where will they land "
