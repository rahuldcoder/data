-- when it comes to reality competition shows , it seems less is not more			1
" @entity7 , " which will feature 90 - minute - long episodes when @entity10 kicks off tonight , is the latest series in its genre to adopt a longer run time			1
it follows in the footsteps of other elimination shows like " @entity14 " and " @entity15 " -- both of which switched from 60 - minute to 120 - minute episodes within the past two years			1
so what is it about elimination shows that draws viewers to the tube for hours at a time , or , in the case of " @entity24 " and " @entity25 , " multiple times a week ? " because of the structure of competition reality shows , people have an incentive to stick around to the end to see who gets eliminated , " said @entity26 , the editor of @entity27			1
" but that does n't mean the preceding 90 or 120 minutes have been full of worthwhile content			1
" while a show like " @entity38 " easily fills a two - hour time slot with complicated tasks , other competition shows struggle to keep viewers engaged , @entity26 says			1
it 's all about leaving viewers wanting more			2
for example , he says , " ' @entity45 ' tribal councils last for 45 minutes or an hour in real life , but much more than 10 minutes on screen would probably be too much , since not all of that conversation is compelling or consequential			0
" @entity52 , the executive producer of " @entity7 , " which follows aspiring fashion designers as they compete for a cash prize , agrees -- noting that 7 hour long shoots are often edited down to 20 or 30 minutes of footage			1
" 120 minutes is a huge commitment , " @entity52 said			2
" this [ 90 minutes ] just felt more like a natural progression -- to give you more , but still leave you wanting more			2
" the extra time will allow viewers to get to know the characters better , @entity52 added			0
" more character development makes the show pop. " " the real people aspect is a draw , " said @entity65 , executive producer and creator of " @entity14			1
" " i know what a scripted character is going to do , i do n't know what a real person is going to do			0
" it 's sometimes hard for viewers to identify with a scripted character , whereas they can watch a reality show and say , ' my mother is just that woman , ' or ' my brother is like that guy , ' @entity65 says			1
the moral of the story : longer episodes mean more time to explore each of the characters			2
that 's what viewers want , he said			2
they want to see " who these people are			2
" this is n't news to reality tv expert and author of " @entity97 , " @entity98 , who says viewers ca n't help but stay tuned when they become attached to the contestants			2
" ' @entity24 , ' ' @entity7 ' -- the professions these people are tying to be a part of are quite prestigious , " he said			1
" very few people have the talent or the courage to actually become [ musicians and clothing designers ]			2
people want to see someone like them achieve these things			0
" and it 's a win - win , @entity113 said			2
the longer " @entity24 " is on , the more ads they sell			0
but , he said , it 's only reality competition shows that this applies to			1
" the difference from these shows compared to ' @entity125 , ' ' @entity121 ' [ and ] ' @entity122 ' is there 's an extra tension in the drama -- someone like you could be humiliated in front of tens of millions of people			1
... there 's a very fine line between someone you feel complete empathy for and someone you 're willing to laugh at , " @entity113 said			0
" could you watch ' the situation ' for more than 40 minutes ? [ no. ] but for something like ' @entity7 , ' with skill and endeavor , people want to look behind the curtain			1
" and while the elimination aspect might be reason enough to tune in for some viewers , @entity65 said the appeal of such shows is very much embedded in the format and the overall process			0
" if [ people ] have to watch too intently , you can only do that for an hour or so			0
" with reality competition shows , you can read the newspaper or leave the room for a minute , come back and still be able to follow along , he added , joking that , during the " lost " finale , " i had to sit there with a piece of paper ... to keep track of what was going on			1
" one viewer who could n't wait for longer episodes of " @entity7 " is @entity166 , who blogs about the show			1
" i love the challenges , " @entity166 said			0
" i love to see the designers work their way through these challenges -- each with their own set of skills , talents and personalities			0
" @entity166 agreed with producer @entity52 that longer episodes mean more of an opportunity for fans to learn about the contestants			0
" you have your favorites that you root for , and usually somebody that you do n't like , " @entity166 laughed			0
" you watch waiting for them to get what they deserve			0
" but it 's not just the contestants on reality competition shows like " @entity7 , " " @entity24 " and " top chef " that keep @entity166 glued to the tube for hours			1
" sometimes i watch a drama and i feel depressed ... i have enough to deal with in life			0
i do n't want to feel unhappy or depressed after watching tv , " she said			0
" i want to feel like i had an adventure			0
i saw the problem , i saw the problem solved , i saw someone win			0
" despite the seemingly foolproof format of reality competition shows , @entity202 says a scripted series could easily hold our attention for more than 44 minutes -- though they usually do n't			1
" it just takes skillful storytelling and a strong arc , " he said .			0
