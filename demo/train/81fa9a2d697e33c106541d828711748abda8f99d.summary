-- new ships , expanded technology and pop culture phenomena are some of the factors making 2014 an alluring year for a vacation at sea			1
january through march is known as " wave season " -- when cruise lines roll out perks and promotions to entice travelers			1
but do n't fret if you 're not ready to plunk down your credit card			0
experts are predicting more year - round savings at sea			1
the traditional wave season booking window can be a great time to snag a deal such as 2 - for - 1 fares , on - board credits and suite upgrades , according to online cruise guide @entity24 , but it does n't always reflect rock - bottom pricing			1
cruise critic editor - in - chief @entity27 says that she 's expecting this year to bring " especially competitive pricing " in the @entity29 , because of an influx of ships plying those waters			1
and if @entity34 is on your cruising bucket list , she says now is a great time to book and take advantage of discounts for travel in april or may			0
@entity41 and other natural oddities " the first tip for saving money is not to primarily focus on saving money , " @entity43 says			0
good value comes from not only getting the right price but also in finding the right trip for your vacation needs and preferences			0
to that end , @entity53 , president of @entity54 , says online research is fine , but ultimately working with a trained agent will get you the best prices because cruises are " much more complicated than booking a flight from point a to point @entity65 " agents familiar with all the options can help with cabin selection , shore excursions and even packaging airfare to get the lowest price			1
follow your preferred cruise line on social media to keep up with flash sales and seasonal specials			1
once you 're on board , amazing add - ons can boost your experience , but they usually come with a hefty price tag			2
check to see if your cruise line offers any advance - purchase deals for dining , alcohol or spa treatments			1
and " keep an eye out for specials advertised in the daily program , " @entity43 advises , as those can be big money savers			2
12 months , 12 amazing adventures stick to a set budget for a la carte purchases for a vacation free of financial surprise and use the on - screen feature on your cabin tv to track your daily spending			2
" be sure to resolve any concerns before the final day , " @entity43 says			0
cruising in 2014 is a far cry from the lazy stereotypes of bygone years ; today 's cruiser can plan on zip lining and skydiving between meals shared with " @entity104 " or a favorite musician			2
pop culture has invaded the oceans			1
here are five things cruise lines are doing to lure new and repeat cruisers : creating exotic and intimate experiences cruise ships are getting a warm welcome in @entity114 , where @entity54 says 3.7 million passengers per year are expected by 2017			1
from the wilderness of the @entity118 to ports in @entity120 and @entity121 , there 's an emphasis on taking passengers to places far off the beaten path			0
@entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 are also beckoning cruise ships			1
what 's more , exotic destinations can also equal top cruising value , according to @entity43			0
" destinations like @entity129 , @entity136 and @entity137 offer exceptional value for money , as exploring them by land tends to be extremely expensive , but traveling by cruise ship costs much less and is often more convenient , " she says			2
the @entity24 editor also flags the @entity145 as a hot spot ; it turns 100 this year , with a new visitors ' center ready to welcome cruise passengers			1
the rivers of the world are also commanding more attention , with tailored itineraries and smaller , luxury vessels attracting globetrotters			0
river cruising is the fastest - growing segment of the cruise industry , says @entity53 , with eight of the 17 new ships due out in 2014 destined for river journeys			1
offering shorter -- and longer -- voyages to attract first - timers wary of an entire week at sea , cruise lines are offering more weekend - length cruises			1
at the same time , lines have realized that sometimes , the typical shore excursion does n't allow enough time to revel in all that a port has to offer , so itineraries have changed			1
for example , @entity136 and @entity172 spend more than a day in @entity174 , carnival ships stop overnight in @entity175 , @entity176 , and a @entity177 sails with a three - day stopover in @entity179 , @entity180			2
improving connectivity connectivity is at an all - time high on the high seas , with bow - to - stern @entity184 and less expensive communication services than in years past			0
cruise lines have spent millions revamping their wireless infrastructures , increasing bandwidth for faster connection speeds and even offering perks such as 500 minutes of free @entity184 that 's given to concierge - level cruisers aboard @entity192			1
these are especially appealing to the social media - loving millennial crowd , who ca n't wait to share their vacation experiences via @entity198 and @entity199			1
harnessing the power of pop culture the " wow " factor of cruising is still strong , with ships constantly trying to outdo each other , not only with bigger and better berths but also with unique activities and elite celebrity associations			1
this year marks the debut of " @entity210 , " a family program on @entity212 , featuring dr. @entity214 - themed fun including " @entity218 " breakfasts , costume parades and character events			2
adults will have no problem finding their pop culture fix afloat , thanks to programs such as " @entity226 " competitions on @entity225 , which will lead to a complimentary seven - day " champions cruise " for 15 finalists and their guests in december			1
for the less competitive , every @entity225 cruise offers free dance classes based on routines from the hit tv show			2
@entity235 out new ships every year brings new vessels designed to convince landlubbers of the advantages of a journey at sea			2
