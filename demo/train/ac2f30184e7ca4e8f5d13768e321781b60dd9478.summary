@entity0 -- the judge investigating the train crash that killed 79 people last july is expanding the preliminary charges to include numerous top officials of the state railway infrastructure company , @entity7 , for alleged negligence , a tuesday court order shows			1
judge @entity10 wrote that five @entity7 officials in charge of track and signal security , along with the current and two former @entity7 presidents , will face preliminary charges because there was no safety system that would have compensated for any human error by the train driver			1
the prime suspect remains the driver , @entity22 , who already faces preliminary charges of 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness			1
the judge 's latest order states that the passenger train was going more than twice the speed limit when it derailed on a curve near the northwest city of @entity33			2
in addition to 79 fatalities , some 170 passengers were injured			1
just before the crash , the driver took a phone call from another official on the train to discuss the train 's route farther north on the journey , the judge wrote			1
an @entity7 spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment about the judge 's order , and company lawyers were studying it			2
in the eight - page order sent by the court to reporters , the judge cites various security systems in place along the section of track where the accident occurred			1
but he adds it appears that @entity7 officials did not adequately mitigate all the predictable scenarios of human error by the driver			1
since the accident , the speed limit at the curve has been reduced from 80 kilometers per hour ( 50 mph ) to just 30 , @entity7 has confirmed			0
last week , @entity69 newspaper @entity68 exclusively obtained audio of the driver 's first , desperate phone call , while injured and still trapped inside the engine , to the train 's control center			1
the court said it did not release the audio , but there are several parties to the case who may have had access to it			0
in the audio , the driver told his control center he " got distracted " and was going 190 kilometers an hour when he should have been doing 80			0
news media reported that part of the conversation in the days after the crash , citing officials , who blamed excessive speed for the crash			2
but the audio recording also contains allegations by the driver that were not widely reported weeks ago , namely his contention that he had warned authorities about what he called the dangerous curve			0
" i had already told security it was dangerous , that one day we were going to eat it , and it happened to me , " the driver , @entity22 , is heard telling the control center in the audio recording			0
a few moments later he added , " oh @entity110 , i had already told the people from security that it was very dangerous			0
we are human ... and this can happen ... that this curve is inhumane			0
understand ? if there was a warning light ... " for weeks , the judge has been investigating other potential causes for the accident , beyond the train 's excessive speed			2
in the court order tuesday , he also asked @entity7 to provide the names of all company board members and all rail security senior officials , since december 2011			0
that 's when the section of track where the accident occurred , and its security systems , went into operation .			0

preliminary charges in the @entity69 train crash will now include top railway officials
judge @entity10 is adding the charges because the train lacked a safety system
he notes there were systems in place at various places , but driver error was not anticipated
the crash took the lives of 79 people and injured some 170
