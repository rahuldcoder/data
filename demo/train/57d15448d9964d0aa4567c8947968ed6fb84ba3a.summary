-- it 's an old accusation , but one that shows no signs of disappearing anytime soon : the @entity4 is disproportionately stricter about profanity and sex than it is about violence			1
relatively gruesome studio films like @entity9 or @entity10 frequently win @entity12 ratings ; relatively gentle films like @entity15 , by contrast , are slammed with a much more restrictive r rating — initially , at least — simply for dropping one too many f - bombs			1
and then there 's the @entity4 's historically fraught relationship with gay and lesbian content , which often seems to be treated more harshly than heterosexual relations			2
the latest apparent victim of this unspoken rule : @entity24 , a new teen comedy about the hottest girl in school ( @entity26 ) and her gay best friend ( @entity28 )			2
@entity0 : will the @entity4 ever get the ratings right ? " i always thought of @entity24 as a @entity12 movie , " the film 's director , @entity30 , wrote in a @entity33 post tuesday			1
unfortunately , he continued , " we were given an @entity36 ' while not having a single f - bomb , hint of nudity or violence in the film			0
perhaps the ratings box should more accurately read ' for homosexual references ' or ' @entity44			0
' " i look forward to a world where queer teens can express their humor and desire in a sweet , fun teen film that does n't get tagged with a cautionary @entity50 , " @entity30 concluded			0
@entity0 : ' @entity15 ' vs. the @entity4 : @entity51 could be collateral damage clearly , @entity24 's team is very disappointed with the @entity4 's decision			1
" i watch the shows awkward and @entity58 and you can find pretty much around the same level of references , and those are tv - 14 , " screenwriter @entity55 told gawker wednesday			0
" it 's so silly when you really think about the @entity4 in terms of how every 13 - year - old in the country has seen hardcore pornography in this age of the @entity69 , and yet they ca n't go to a movie theater and see a movie like @entity24 it would be funny if it were n't so sad			1
" @entity24 premiered in april at the @entity73			2
it hits theaters nationwide jan. 17			1
