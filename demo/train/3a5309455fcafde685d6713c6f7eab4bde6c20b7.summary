these days , both violent video games and @entity1 have come under fire in the media and the court of public opinion , albeit for different reasons			1
now , @entity6 hopes to change the perception of both gaming and the nation 's lawmakers with " government in @entity12 , " a @entity14 multiplayer game			1
designed for the college freshman @entity17 government course , which is taken by more than 750,000 students every year , the game allows players to experience the intricacies of life as a @entity17 representative -- and explain why actually getting legislation passed is n't always as easy as it would seem			1
for today 's digital generation , it may prove a fresher approach to complex subject matter than the traditional textbook			2
rep. @entity30 , @entity31 , who worked with game developer @entity32 , hopes this game will be another tool to get students interested in learning more about how @entity1 works			1
" the ability to interact rather than just reading a text in this technology - driven age will probably drive more interest , " @entity36 said			0
" video games with a core educational component may supplement traditional materials , such as textbooks , and may enable students to improve their understanding of certain subjects			2
" the game begins with the player getting elected to the @entity51 , with two years to get re-elected			1
according to @entity53 , chief digital officer at @entity6 , the goal is to build up political capital , awareness , approval and influence in multiple ways			1
gameplay takes place both in @entity61 and in the player 's home district			1
the game will randomly assign players a congressman and political affiliation , and the president of the @entity17 will also be randomly determined with each play			1
the game allows players to meet with the president and go to the @entity71			1
" players will need to work with both national and local media , appease local and national lobbyists , hold fundraisers and find co-sponsors of bills that will keep their constituents happy and align with their own political ideologies of left , centrist or right , " @entity53 said			2
" in multiplayer , which supports up to 18 players , fellow classmates can join together to co-sponsor bills , and the game 's been designed to be customizable based on how the instructor wants to utilize it during his class or throughout a semester			1
" the game , which is part of the @entity88 suite of hands - on , experiential learning games , was tested in schools across the country , including @entity93 , @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 in @entity95 and @entity99 in @entity100			2
professor @entity101 of @entity93 said the game helped his students tie all of the concepts in his course together to develop a deeper understanding and knowledge of the subject			1
" with an engaged classroom , i can spend less time transferring facts and more time exploring implications , " he said			0
despite the negative press that video games sometimes get , they 're changing the way subjects are being taught in classrooms across the country			2
according to a march 2012 survey of teachers , 32 % use games two to four days per week , while 18 % use them every day			0
an overwhelming 70 % of teachers agreed that using digital games boosts motivation and engagement , and 62 % of teachers said that games make teaching easier			0
@entity128 , president and ceo of @entity32 , said the challenge with serious games is to make them both fun and educational			0
while there have been proven benefits of using games as part of educational curriculum , educational games are n't flooding the market			0
" the fact that ' @entity141 ' and ' @entity142 ' still stand out after 30 years is n't great from the perspective of how powerful good , serious games can be , " @entity128 said			0
@entity128 's team is expanding " @entity150 " to work on @entity146 and @entity147 tablets to take advantage of touch controls			0
the @entity146 version of the game will make its debut at the 2013 @entity155 conference in @entity156 , @entity95			0
" educators seem to have more tools available to them than ever before , and there 's no doubt that , when appropriately utilized , technology has the capacity to enhance the classroom experience , " @entity36 said			0
" the key , of course , is to familiarize and excite teachers to maximize its use in the most positive way			0
" as is the nature of gaming , " @entity171 " has been designed to be addictive			1
instructors have found that students will replay the game again and again to explore myriad options , as well as to compete on the leaderboard			2
making virtual government fun is quite an achievement			0
now , if these game developers could just translate that into the real - world government , that would be something else .			0

the game from @entity6 is designed to be used in college classrooms
