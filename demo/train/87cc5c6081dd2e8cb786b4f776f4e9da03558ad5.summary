-- there had been no confirmed deaths in the @entity3 related to swine flu as of tuesday afternoon			1
but another virus had killed thousands of people since january and is expected to keep killing hundreds of people every week for the rest of the year			2
people are nervous about swine flu , but the regular flu kills 36,000 people a year in the @entity3			1
that one ? the regular flu			0
an outbreak of swine flu that is suspected in more than 150 deaths in @entity15 and has sickened dozens of people in the @entity3 and elsewhere has grabbed the attention of a nervous public and of medical officials worried the strain will continue to mutate and spread			1
experts are nervous that , as a new strain , the swine flu will be harder to stop because there are n't any vaccines to fight it			1
but even if there are swine - flu deaths outside @entity15 -- and medical experts say there very well may be -- the virus would have a long way to go to match the roughly 36,000 deaths that seasonal influenza causes in the @entity3 each year			1
" that happens on an annual basis , " dr. @entity34 said tuesday			0
@entity34 is vice president and medical director at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			0
since january , more than 13,000 people have died of complications from seasonal flu , according to the @entity45 's weekly report on the causes of death in the nation			1
no fewer than 800 flu - related deaths were reported in any week between january 1 and april 18 , the most recent week for which figures were available			2
the report looks at deaths in the 122 largest cities in the @entity3			2
worldwide , the annual death toll from the flu is estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000			1
about 9 out of 10 of those deaths are among people older than 65 , @entity34 said			1
most times , they already have health problems that the flu makes worse , he said			0
" regular influenza can be taxing , " he said			0
" it causes their underlying disease to decompensate and then they do n't have the reserves to get through it			0
" while it may not be the direct cause listed on the death certificate , it certainly contributed			0
" one of the reasons medical experts are nervous about the swine flu outbreak is that many of the people who have died in @entity15 have been young and otherwise healthy			1
the strains found in the @entity3 have so far been weaker			0
but even the regular flu is sometimes fatal for younger victims			0
" it 's not unheard of			0
it happens , either directly from influenza or they get a bacterial superinfection " like staph , said @entity34			0
while researchers have n't developed a vaccine to fight the new swine flu , it can be treated with antiviral drugs @entity90 and @entity92 , the same drugs used on the regular flu			2
many times , seasonal flu itself is tough to prevent because it has mutated to a form different than it was when the vaccine was made			2
seeking to put the swine flu outbreak in perspective tuesday , @entity100 public health officer dr. @entity99 echoed other public officials calling it " cause for concern , but not for alarm			2
" " given the size of @entity100 , given the traffic between here and @entity15 , it would be very surprising if we did n't have any cases , " @entity99 said			0
he said the county , where the @entity45 had confirmed 10 cases of swine flu by tuesday , sees more than 1,000 flu - related deaths every year			1
" so it would also not be surprising if there were deaths with swine flu -- even if it had the pattern of seasonal flu , " he said			1
" thus far , the pattern we see in the @entity3 is very similar to that of seasonal flu -- relatively mild to moderate cases			1
" @entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
