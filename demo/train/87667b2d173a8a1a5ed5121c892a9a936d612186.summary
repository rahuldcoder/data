-- a third person -- identified only as a girl -- has died from injuries sustained in last week 's crash of @entity9 , officials at the @entity3 hospital where she was being treated said friday			1
@entity11 spokeswoman @entity10 said the " minor girl " had been in critical condition at the @entity14 hospital since last saturday 's incident			1
the hospital did n't release any information about the girl -- including her name , age or ethnicity -- who died friday morning , according to dr. @entity23 , the hospital 's chief of surgery			1
" it 's a very , very sad day today at @entity11 , " said dr. @entity26 , chief of neurosurgery			2
" we have all done everything we could			0
" two other people -- both 16 - year - old girls from @entity32 -- were reported dead soon after the @entity34 crash - landed at @entity35			0
one of those teenagers was hit on the runway by a fire truck , though it 's not clear whether she was already dead when she was struck , @entity3 police spokesman @entity36 told @entity0 on friday			1
at the time , firefighters were using flame retardant that ended up surrounding areas immediately around the plane with foam , @entity36 said			1
" when the truck repositioned itself to get a better aim of the fuselage , they discovered the body of the victim in the fresh track from the path of the truck , " he added			1
the foam was thick enough to cover a body , @entity36 noted			2
moreover , it is difficult for those in the " industrial - size " fire trucks that responded to crash to see things on the ground , the police spokesman said			1
" right now , we are waiting results from the coroner to determine if she died from the crash or the fire engine going over her , " the police spokesman said			1
" and that will be part of our investigations , like any other case , by our hit - and - run and major accidents investigations teams			2
" of the passengers and crew on board , 304 people survived -- 123 of whom walked away relatively unscathed and the remainder sent to hospitals			0
a handful of them remained hospitalized , including six patients at @entity11 as of 3 p.m. ( 6 p.m. et ) friday			2
that hospital 's figure include two adults in critical condition with spinal cord injuries , abdominal injuries , internal bleeding , road rash and fractures			1
besides the passengers and crew members ' physical recovery , @entity35 is working to get back to normal as well			0
the airport was shut down to incoming and departing traffic for several hours after the @entity102 crash , which occurred around 11:30 a.m. saturday			2
two of its four runways reopened later that day , though the charred remnants of the downed 777 remained -- a visible reminder of the horror that had unfolded			2
early friday morning , that airline 's fuselage was hauled away on flatbed trucks to a remote section of the airport , said @entity35 in a press release			1
by 5:05 p.m. , a @entity116 jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that , for the first time in six days , all four of the airport 's runways were operational			1
" the tremendous efforts and around - the - clock work of airport staff , government agencies , airline tenants and contractors allowed us to complete all repairs and safety certifications for @entity132 in a timely and efficient manner , " said airport director @entity122			0
while the wreckage has been hauled away , investigators still have not pinpointed exactly why @entity9 crashed , or who was to blame			0
an in - depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway , the head of the @entity138 said thursday			0
the first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash and a second was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact , @entity138 chief @entity146 said			0
the agency has begun wrapping up its investigation at the airport and crews are cleaning up the debris left by the crash			0
investigators turned the runway back over to the airport			0
the runway has been closed since saturday 's crash			0
the investigation is shifting back to @entity138 headquarters in @entity169 , where authorities will work to find a more definitive answer about what led to the crash			0
the passenger jet 's main landing gear slammed into the seawall between the airport and @entity178 , spinning the aircraft 360 degrees as it broke into pieces and eventually caught fire			1
@entity0 's @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .			0
