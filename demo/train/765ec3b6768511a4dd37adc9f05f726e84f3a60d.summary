@entity0 , @entity1 -- as one of the world 's leading aviation marketplaces , the @entity3 is usually an opportunity for airline executives to reach for their checkbooks			1
this year some might also be reaching for the stars			0
you told us : top 5 spots for plane geeks for six days from july 9 , the airshow , will transform a small town to the west of @entity18 into a major aviation hub , attracting 250,000 visitors with its unique mix of big business and aerial entertainment			0
with the @entity25 and other major @entity27 markets wallowing in recession or serious debt problems , industry experts warn the show -- now in its 64th year -- could lack some of the sparkle of its predecessors			1
billions of dollars are still expected to change hands as passenger jets , cargo planes , fighter jets and unmanned drones are snapped up			1
but with no traditional aviation launches or announcements scheduled , the main attraction will be a spacecraft			0
a version of @entity45 's @entity44 -- a two - pilot , six - passenger craft capable of sub-orbital travel -- is scheduled to make its @entity27 debut at the show			1
reports suggest @entity45 boss @entity51 will use the event to reveal design changes to the craft , which could be carrying its first passengers into orbit next year			1
so far 500 people -- including movie star @entity58 -- have signed up for a $ 200,000 flight			0
where planes go to die @entity51 may also announce that @entity45 is reviving plans for a satellite - launching service , possibly spurred on by the commercial @entity65 spacecraft , which successfully docked with the @entity66 earlier this year			1
with 1,400 aviation companies from 40 different countries attending the show , conventional air travel will remain the overall focus -- but do n't expect too many surprises			2
see also : infographic on the global state of aviation " this year wo n't be a show for aircraft debuts or actual hardware that we 'll be seeing for the first time , " @entity76 , editor of flight international magazine , told @entity2			1
" there 's nothing there which will be new and terribly exciting			2
it will be more about the business			0
" and business is likely to be brisk			0
major manufacturers can expect to take significant bookings for their newest aircraft			2
@entity93 will be touting its @entity95 superjumbo while rival @entity96 will be seeking orders for its giant 747 - 8 and its super-efficient @entity98			1
in 2010 , @entity0 witnessed sales of 157 @entity96 and 133 @entity93 aircraft			1
among these was an $ 9.1 billion order from @entity104 - based @entity103 for 30 @entity105			0
in total , orders worth $ 47 billion were placed			0
however , says @entity76 , overall sales this year may suffer because of the squeeze that the economic downturn is putting on @entity27 civil and defense aviation budgets , which usually account for a major slice of the trade at @entity0			1
these people really love to fly this , he says , is doing little to help the airshow maintain its relevance at a time when the difficulties of holding a major aviation event near @entity18 are making it less viable			0
@entity124 defense giant @entity123 is among several big names missing from this year 's show			2
" @entity0 remains an important platform for the industry to meet , for the supply chain to get together and for the companies to meet their customers , " he said			2
" it 's also still an important platform for companies to make media announcements			2
" but on the negative side , its a big , costly show and some of the logistics are challenging , particularly for those people staying and traveling from @entity18			0
" it also struggles a little bit against some of the more niche competitors aimed at smaller parts of the industry			0
and it struggles because @entity27 is not a growth market -- the growth markets are @entity151 , @entity152 , the @entity153 and even @entity154			2
" where dead airplanes come back to life in addition to a glimpse of the @entity45 exhibition , those who do brave the traffic congestion and unpredictable @entity25 summer weather will also be rewarded with the noisy aerial displays that are a trademark of the @entity0 show			1
these will include an appearance by a @entity169 - outfitted @entity98 -- the first time the much - delayed flagship has appeared in airline livery			1
unconfirmed reports suggest the 787 may make a fly - past , ending @entity96 's long absence from aerial display at @entity0			1
says @entity76 , the displays at @entity0 ( which opens up to the public for its final two days ) often prove to be a distraction from the business side of the show , but they are also a key attraction			1
among those wowing spectators with their aerial agility will be the @entity188 @entity187 squadron , the @entity189 , the @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			0
" it 's really two shows			0
during the week it 's a trade exhibition and at the weekend it is more about showing aviation to the public			0
this shows @entity25 taxpayers what their money is being spent on and it engages young people in a possible aerospace career -- so there is a plus side , " he added			2
