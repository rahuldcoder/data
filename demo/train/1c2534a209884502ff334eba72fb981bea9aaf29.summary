-- physical attraction may be as old as time , but new studies are beginning to uncover the science behind sex appeal			1
unexpected factors -- like biochemical odors , face shape and voice pitch -- just might have more to do with your choice of mate than anyone ever expected			1
biostatistics expert @entity14 explains why actress @entity16 scored very high on facial attractiveness			1
@entity18 and @entity19 are leading the research on the human scent 's influence on sexual attraction			1
they 've found that when women are ovulating , they produce copulins , a scent that attracts men			1
the researchers believe when a man gets a whiff of copulins , his testosterone levels rise			0
as a result , he secretes androstenone , an odor that repels women who are n't ovulating			1
" bars and nightclubs across the world are the battlefield for this invisible biochemical war , " @entity38 says			0
sex therapist dr. @entity44 says attraction has a lot more to do with science and evolution than people might think			1
" we are innately all puppies in heat , " she says			1
" we are capable of discerning 10,000 different scents consciously			0
but then there 's a whole realm of unconscious scents that we 're not even aware that we 're smelling			1
" @entity0 : get dr. @entity44 's 5 steps to better sex these odors let people know when a woman is fertile and when a man 's testosterone levels are high , @entity44 says			1
as a result , individuals can tell when someone else is most ripe for reproduction			0
" it 's all about survival of the species , " she says			2
one common complaint @entity44 hears among women with relationship problems is that they love their partner , but they 're not in love with him			1
" there is a difference between love and chemistry , " @entity44 says			1
" take a really good whiff of him without cologne when he 's relatively clean			2
if that smell turns you on , that 's a really good cue of chemistry			1
" @entity0 : can the chemistry come later ? in one recent study , @entity44 says , researchers had women smell men 's t - shirts			1
the women were most attracted to the shirts of men with a different major histocompatability complex ( @entity98 ) from them			1
@entity98 is a collection of genes that are related to immune systems			0
" we unconsciously want to mate with someone who has a different immune system than ours because that helps with the survival of our offspring , " @entity44 says			1
the t - shirt study also found that women taking hormonal contraception were attracted to men who had similar @entity98 as they did			1
" if you 're on the pill , your body is being tricked into think you 're pregnant , so you 're not ovulating , " @entity44 says			1
" the bad news there is that they have looked at these couples who have similar @entity98 , and not only do they have higher levels of infidelity and higher levels of marital discord , but they also have higher infertility issues			2
" another unexpected factor that has been found to directly affect attraction is voice pitch			2
@entity127 , @entity128 , a professor at the @entity129 at @entity130 , says that women with higher estrogen levels have higher voices , which makes them more desirable to men			1
" when females are midcycle , when they 're the most fertile , the most likely to conceive , their voices are rated as being significantly more attractive , " he says			2
it 's hard to pinpoint what distinguishes a gorgeous face from an average one , but some researchers are getting pretty close			2
psychologist @entity142 , @entity128 , of the @entity143 in @entity144 says she 's found that women 's faces get more attractive to men when they are ovulating			1
" we 're not entirely clear why there 's this difference , but we think that the women might look healthier , have a bit of a healthier glow when they are ovulating			1
" symmetry is another factor that determines a face 's attractiveness			2
@entity14 , an assistant professor of biostatistics at the @entity160 , says there is a formula for the " perfect " face			0
she uses 29 different measurements to determine someone 's appeal on a scale of 1 to 10			2
to start , @entity168 says the ratio of the length of the face to the width of the face should be 1.6 , also known as the golden ratio			0
" the face should also be divided into three equal pieces vertically , " she says			0
" the forehead , then [ the bottom of the forehead to ] the nose and then from the nose to the chin			0
" who 's face is the most " perfect , " according to @entity168 's measurements ? no big surprise here ! " @entity188 's is the highest that i 've ever used the [ formula ] on , " she says			2
" he was a 9.3 [ out of 10 ]			0
" @entity188 's partner , @entity191 , did n't fare too badly either			2
" @entity191 was a 7.67 , and that 's pretty high , " @entity168 says			2
" most people rate about 4 to 6			0
... the thing that is probably lowering her score is the thing that she 's most famous for -- her full lips			2
" @entity168 says that ideally the width of a mouth should be twice the height of the lips			0
other celebrities @entity168 tested were @entity16 , who scored a 7.36 , and @entity204 , a 6.45			0
" there 's never been anyone who was a perfect 10 , " @entity168 says			2
" if you 're out there , we 're looking for you ! " not everything that goes into finding a partner is biological			0
researchers have also found that if a woman looks at the face of a man whom she knows nothing about , she will give it a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 that 's different than if she is shown the same face and a corresponding income			1
when a man makes a lot of money , a woman will rate him higher on an attractiveness scale than she would that same man with a smaller income			1
@entity0 : what do women really want ? @entity44 says this is n't a case of women being gold diggers			1
" it goes back again to evolution			0
when we were having babies who were very dependent on us , we could n't hunt and take care of ourselves , so we were looking for the man who had the most social status , who was the best hunter , who was going to bring home the biggest chunk of meat for our babies , " she says			0
" it 's the same thing today			0
" smell , voice pitch and face symmetry might be unconscious detectors of attractiveness , but if you 're trying to consciously assess the future of a relationship , @entity44 says there 's one surefire way			1
" you really learn a lot from a kiss			0
... sixty - six percent of women say they would dump a guy after a bad first kiss , " she says			0
" it 's not only because you 're getting that good whiff of him so you 're seeing if you like the way he smells			0
all your senses are engaged , and you get a sense of his sensuality , his connection , whether he 's a take - charge kind of guy or more of a stepping back kind			0
" when it comes to relationships , @entity44 says kissing frequency is a direct indicator of happiness			1
" it turns out that couples who kiss and cuddle regularly are eight times less likely to be stressed and depressed than couples who do n't get that , " she says			0
" you have to have a minimum of a 10 - second kiss every day			0
