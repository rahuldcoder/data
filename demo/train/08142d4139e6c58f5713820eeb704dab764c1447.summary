-- it 's almost that time : the once - a - decade - moment when the @entity2 tries to determine the population			0
counting more than 300 million residents is a complex and costly operation ( an estimated $ 14 billion ) , but the results yield the basis for how we apportion @entity9 , distribute more than $ 400 billion in federal funds and understand basic changes to the number and geographic distribution of @entity15 residents			1
the largest challenge that the @entity2 faces is ensuring everyone is counted , regardless of where they live , who they live with and perhaps most controversially , regardless of whether they are authorized to live in the @entity15			1
most households will receive a census form by mail in mid-march to be filled out as of @entity26 , april 1			1
first results of state counts for redistricting purposes must be delivered by december 31			0
the rest of the results will be released over a period of time that ends in 2013			0
filling out a census form is mandatory by law			1
the @entity36 will have 10 basic questions for each household member , but it is viewed as a burdensome task by some because they see the questions as too personal or the process too intrusive			1
others distrust what the government will do with the information or fear that it may be used against them			0
some are hampered by language barriers			0
still others have more than one residence			0
every decade , the @entity2 works hard to make sure everyone is counted once and only once			0
and it makes an extra effort to count those who have traditionally been hard to count : racial and ethnic minorities , immigrants and the poor			2
this coming census -- the largest count of the @entity15 population with more immigrants and minorities than ever -- will be complicated further by the economic downturn and foreclosure crisis because many people are " doubling up " or otherwise living in temporary quarters			1
the census questionnaire asks for a count of all people who live and sleep in the household " most of the time , " as of april 1 , but not those who are living away at college or in the military or those who are living in a nursing home or who are in a jail , prison or detention facility			1
( they are counted separately from households			0
) " home " may have changed recently for those whose hardship leaves them little choice but to live with relatives or friends , however temporary that may be			0
" home " for displaced residents of the @entity100 may be miles away from where they lived before the devastation that @entity94 and @entity95 wrought in their communities			0
" home " for some immigrants is in @entity15 communities even though they are not legally residing in the @entity15			1
and " home " may be in a prison or detention center in a state far away from the inmate 's hometown residence			0
these are the very residents that @entity36 will try hardest to enumerate this spring			1
abutting the challenges of where to call home are the public debates surrounding them : -- civil rights leaders , recognizing the unique context of the @entity100 region , are working hard to ensure an accurate local @entity36			1
at the same time , other regional leaders would like to see displaced @entity100 residents counted where they lived before the storms			2
-- a coalition of @entity124 leaders is lobbying for inmates to be counted in their place of residence before imprisonment			2
-- a tug - of - war has ensued between @entity131 leaders on one side who are working to get an accurate count of the population regardless of legal status and those on the other side who are advocating a census boycott by immigrants as a way to put pressure on @entity9 to move forward with federal immigration reform			1
-- a recent amendment introduced in the @entity143 would have delayed the implementation and hiked up the cost of the census , had it passed			2
in an attempt to exclude the unauthorized population from the official count for congressional apportionment purposes , it would have required questions on citizenship and immigration status for each respondent			2
that data is not collected to encourage participation in the census			2
the senators missed the deadline by two years to make a change of that order of magnitude			0
given the demands and challenges , it is vital that we bear in mind the importance of achieving an accurate count and the economic , political and policy implications if we fail			2
understanding our changing population : state and local data on age , race and ethnicity , household size and composition help communities with projections for school enrollment , housing , transportation and health care			0
businesses use census data for decisions about where to locate and for marketing purposes			2
information from the census is used to prepare for emergency services , research changes and advocate for various causes			0
distributing federal dollars geographically : more than $ 400 billion a year is at stake , federal funds that go to states and localities to build schools , hospitals , highways and fund programs such as @entity204			0
apportioning @entity9 : the redistricting and apportionment of congressional seats is contingent on census results			0
this is the primary purpose of the census as written into the @entity15 @entity211			1
states and localities also use the data to redistrict ; therefore it is in every state 's interest to be accurately represented based on their residents			0
one debate that has been resolved : @entity36 2010 will not use statistical sampling as many @entity222 leaders have feared			1
sampling has been proposed as one way to mitigate the undercount of minority populations , the majority of whom are assumed to vote @entity229			0
the @entity15 @entity2 does use sampling in its annual @entity231 that collects more detailed data including social , economic , and demographic characteristics			1
the political and equity arguments will continue to surface as we head into @entity36 2010			1
public officials , advocacy groups , and community organizations will need to work together with census officials to get the most out of what will be a difficult enumeration , but one that sets the stage for the next decade			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			1

as the @entity36 gets underway , the counting process will be especially difficult
@entity247 says *recession* has led to people doubling up in living quarters
she says @entity131 leaders are split over how to deal with the census
the census aims to count everyone , whether they *'re* legally entitled to be in @entity15 , @entity247 says
