@entity0 , @entity1 -- how do you count six days when you can see neither sun nor stars ? buried under a crumbled building , @entity6 marked time by the roar of tractors and bulldozers , by the sound of voices			1
" there 's nobody alive in there , " she heard them say			1
when there was silence , she believed it to be night			2
but @entity22 , a deeply spiritual young woman , chanted the @entity24 until she was discovered by @entity26 and @entity27 rescuers and pulled out of the rubble of @entity0 's @entity29 on january 18			1
" i always knew i would keep breathing			1
i knew i would live , " she said			1
but the miracle of rescue was only the first hurdle			2
sixteen days later , she is struggling to navigate life anew			1
she bears physical scars as proof of her ordeal			2
a bandage on her left shoulder			2
cuts and scrapes cover her head and arms			2
it 's harder to detect the inner damage of a young woman who gave her all to endure			1

the private college was n't cheap -- $ 1,000 a year			2
but her brother took her under his wing , paid her tuition , even gave her a place to stay at his house			2
on that tuesday , the house was empty by midmorning			2
everyone had somewhere else to be			2
the normally bookish @entity22 just was n't in the mood for class			1
she might have even skipped except that her tuition was due			2
she reluctantly showered and put on the gray collared shirt she always wore to school with a pair of black jeans and sandals			2
she did n't wear much makeup -- just some powder and eyeliner , though she fussed over her hair and nails			2
she liked to get a manicure every five days with a fresh coat of baby pink on her toes			1
she was n't hungry , but the housekeeper forced food on her plate			0
@entity96 , bean sauce , vegetables			0
she walked down to the bus stop and waited almost an hour before one carried her to @entity101 in central @entity0			1
by the time , she reached the university , it was almost 3 p.m. she ran her errands and settled into class on the sixth floor with 20 other students			1
on this day , she took a seat by the door , though usually , she sat farther inside			1

the two women lay conjoined like siamese twins , unable to move , trapped under layers of pancaked concrete , mortar and metal			0
' we 're alive ' there was no signal on @entity22 's cell phone , but with the @entity147 light , she could see the cuts and bruises on @entity131 's face			1
she knew she probably looked the same			1
above her , she could see the feet of the dead			1
soon the rats would come to gnaw on fresh human flesh			0
the two women maneuvered themselves so they were not smothered by concrete			0
they curled up together , @entity22 's legs bent over her chest to allow for breathing room			1
they took turns sleeping to keep their energy up			0
the other would stay awake and call out to the outside world			0
" she could see the levels of the building underneath her			0
occasionally , the earth trembled again , and more chunks came crashing down			0
when the phone finally gave out , @entity22 's world went dark			1
she tore a page from a notebook and stuffed it up her nostrils			0
it was n't enough to cover the wretched smell of human decay			0
as the days passed , @entity22 thirsted for water			1

it was to @entity190 that @entity22 came with boyfriend tales and all the tribulations of a 23 - year - old			1
the day after the quake , @entity190 had frantically run from one makeshift hospital to another in @entity0 , searching for her sister			1
when she did not find her , she stood every day before the mound of the university building , watching rescue teams dig deeper			2
she watched students and teachers come out alive			0

" give me strength , " she said			0
she pointed a finger at @entity227 and made a pact			0
" i 'm not dying today			0

she wanted to dance again , play tennis on her @entity261			0
and hear @entity263 's mellifluous voice			2
saved on monday , rescuers finally reached @entity22 and her friend			1
she does n't remember details of how they were pulled out			0
