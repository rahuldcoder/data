president @entity0 delivered one of the most crucial addresses of his presidency , seeking to convince an overwhelmingly skeptical public of the need to punish @entity6 militarily for alleged chemical weapons use while demonstrating a commitment to pursuing a surprise diplomatic opening to remove those stockpiles from the war - torn nation			1
with many in @entity14 and on @entity15 demanding clarity during fast - moving events , @entity0 had five questions to answer tuesday night : did he do it ? 1			1
with diplomacy in play , why is military action necessary ? this was the most important question the president needed to tackle in his 15 - minute , prime - time address			2
in a major development , @entity6 has reportedly accepted a @entity29 proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile to international control , but the details of what was actually agreed to are still murky			1
the @entity34 is skeptical , cautioning that it could be a stall tactic			1
but it said it would take a hard look , and it pledged to work with international partners to see what can be achieved			0
@entity0 is dispatching secretary of state @entity39 to @entity40 , @entity41 , on thursday to meet with his @entity29 counterpart to see where the initiative may go			1
a stunning turn that could silence @entity6 war drums @entity0 spent most of the speech laying out a chronology of events and pushing for military action on moral , political and strategic grounds , saying that previous efforts to resolve the @entity6 conflict diplomatically had failed			1
he painted a graphic picture of an august 21 attack that his administration says was carried out by the regime of @entity57 and killed more than 1,400 people			2
" the images from this massacre are sickening : men , women , children lying in rows , killed by poison gas			0
others foaming at the mouth , gasping for breath			0
a father clutching his dead children , imploring them to get up and walk			0
on that terrible night , the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons , and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off limits -- a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws of war , " he said			1
he only brought up the @entity29 development later in the address , calling the offer an encouraging sign			1
but he warned that " it 's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed , and any agreement must verify that the @entity57 regime keeps its commitments			2
" he left open the possibility of diplomacy falling short , saying that he has ordered the military to maintain its posture in the region " to keep the pressure on @entity57			0
" and he wrapped up by arguing that @entity98 must lead and that force was just in this case			2
" @entity98 is not the world 's policeman			2
terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong			0
but when , with modest effort and risk , we can stop children from being gassed to death , and thereby make our own children safer over the long run , i believe we should act			0
that 's what makes @entity98 different			2
that 's what makes us exceptional , " he said			2
he did , however , put on hold the domestic effort intended to approve a military strike			0
he asked @entity122 hold off on voting on the issue -- a vote he probably did not have majority support for			0
commentators said after the speech that most @entity98 probably understand the moral case , but they questioned whether @entity0 could ultimately sway public opinion to see things his way			1
a @entity134 / @entity133 initial poll of viewers of the speech found that 47 % said @entity0 made a convincing case for action , compared with 50 % who said he did not			1
@entity98 rep. @entity140 , a @entity142 @entity141 and staunch @entity0 supporter who is undecided about the @entity6 issue , praised him for " a very good job " but said his position remained unchanged			1
" it was not a wasted speech , " said @entity140 , noting that his constituents are tired of war			0
" i thought he made a great moral argument			0
" share your view of the speech 2			0
why should @entity98 worry about @entity6 ? @entity0 stressed again that the use of sarin gas in @entity6 was a moral abomination that @entity98 and the international community simply can not tolerate			1
but , simply put , @entity98 are sick of war			0
in a @entity134 / @entity161 poll released monday , six in 10 say the @entity163 war was a mistake , and about half say the same thing about @entity167			2
three - quarters say the @entity98 is not the world 's policeman			2
additionally , nearly seven in 10 say that it 's not in the @entity98 national interest to get involved in @entity6 's civil war			1
moreover , 72 % , say a @entity98 airstrike would not achieve significant @entity98 goals			0
still , @entity0 laid out a strategic rationale for military force , saying that what happens in @entity6 could affect allies in the region , including @entity182 -- all in the @entity98 interest , he said			1
@entity184 , he said , would leave @entity57 " with no reason to stop using chemical weapons			2
" and as the global ban against them erodes , " other tyrants " could acquire them and use them , as well against civilians and even @entity98 troops			0
" if fighting spills beyond @entity6 's borders , these weapons could threaten allies like @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity182			1
and a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction , and embolden @entity57 's ally , @entity207 , which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon or to take a more peaceful path , " @entity0 said			1
@entity134 poll : part of @entity6 strike opposition is the messenger 's fault @entity216 , director of the @entity217 at the @entity218 , said an indirect connection to @entity98 ' security is a difficult case to make , " and the president is not making it			1
" " i do n't think he can make a case , because i do n't think he knows what to do , " @entity223 added			2
what would be the endgame ? @entity0 explained the goal of military strikes			1
he has said the @entity98 does not want to use the strike to take out @entity57 , institute regime change or even aid the rebels in the civil war			0
" the purpose of this strike would be to deter @entity57 from using chemical weapons , to degrade his regime 's ability to use them and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 did say the @entity98 could not " resolve someone else 's civil war through force , " and he said he would not send in @entity98 troops or pursue an open - ended war like those in @entity163 or @entity167			1
" i will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like @entity250 or @entity251			0
this would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective , " he said			0
" even a limited strike will send a message to @entity57 that no other nation can deliver , " he said			2
" a targeted strike can make @entity57 , or any other dictator , think twice before using chemical weapons			2
" he said that " the day after any military action , we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism			2
" sen. @entity269 , a @entity271 @entity270 and a member of the @entity273 , told @entity134 after the speech that @entity0 did not provide a clear military objective for attacking @entity6			1
he said bombing the regime will not truly hold @entity57 accountable and " will create instability in the @entity281 " that would leave an opening for extremist elements in @entity6 allied with @entity279			1
@entity98 rep. @entity282 , @entity283 , agreed with @entity269			0
" the president has failed to deliver some sort of plan that tells the @entity98 people that we can do this and this is what we are trying to accomplish , " he told @entity134			0
@entity293 : how they 'll vote on @entity6 strike 4			1
if the @entity98 attacks , what if @entity57 retaliates ? this is a major risk that concerns many members of @entity122			0
if the @entity98 military attack is extremely limited and @entity57 retaliates , what are the contingency plans ? sen. @entity303 , @entity304 , asked that critical question : " what if we execute this strike and then he decides to use chemical weapons again			1
do we strike again ? " she said it 's one of her biggest concerns			0
@entity0 did not address the contingency scenario directly , other than to say that not responding would carry unacceptable risks			1
" if we fail to act , the @entity57 regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons , " he said , adding that continued use could make it easier for terrorists to get their hands on them			0
@entity324 has said he would respond			0
" you should expect everything , " he told @entity325 and @entity327 interviewer @entity326			0
@entity0 said the @entity98 does not dismiss threats			2
" but the @entity57 regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military			0
any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day			0
neither @entity57 nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise , " @entity0 said			2
now that @entity6 welcomes diplomacy , why did @entity0 address the public ? @entity0 told @entity134 's @entity345 this week that he is n't convinced that @entity6 is telling the truth			1
the administration distrusts @entity6 and its ally @entity29 , and it worries that the proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile is simply a tactic to buy time and derail a potential @entity98 strike			1
while the administration indicated that it will look into @entity6 's offer , the president does n't want to get burned			1
so he continued to press his case for a military strike			0
and if @entity6 's offer proves empty , the president wo n't have lost any time waiting on the sidelines			1
@entity0 told the nation from the start : " i want to talk to you about @entity6 -- why it matters and where we go from here			1
" @entity223 said the speech put the president in a difficult situation			0
" he was trying to convince people of a war they do n't want , but he 's also saying wait , " @entity223 noted			0
former house speaker @entity369 , a co-host of @entity134 's " crossfire , " said @entity0 was misguided in going on national television with the situation so fluid and having told @entity122 to hold off on considering a force resolution to give diplomacy a chance			1
rep. @entity282 said the president 's speech did nothing to convince him to support a possible military strike			0
he said that after attending every possible briefing and listening to the speech , " it 's locked me more into a solid ' no ' than anything			0

@entity0 addressed the nation from the @entity34 on tuesday night
he addressed several key questions in a bid to sway public opinion
