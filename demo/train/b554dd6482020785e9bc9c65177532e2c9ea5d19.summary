do not appear to be increasing their risk of heart attack or stroke , as some experts have feared , according to a new study published today on the website of the @entity11			1
stimulant medications -- a class that includes @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity14 , and their generic versions -- and the non-stimulant drug @entity18 have all been shown to slightly raise blood pressure and heart rate , which can contribute to heart problems			1
researchers have n't conclusively linked these side effects to heart attacks , strokes , or sudden death from heart - related causes , but the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) has received numerous reports of these and other heart problems in people taking stimulants for adhd			1
in 2006 , the @entity28 ordered stimulant manufacturers to add warnings about potential heart risks to their product labels , although the agency stopped short of requiring the so - called black box warning an advisory panel had recommended			1
@entity0 : 15 signs you may have adult @entity4 the new study , which was funded and partly overseen by the @entity28 and other federal health agencies , is the largest of its kind to date and seems to bear out the @entity28 's decision to opt for a milder label warning			1
researchers at several large health insurers across the nation analyzed the medical and pharmacy records of 443,198 people between the ages of 25 and 64 , roughly one - third of whom had filled prescriptions for stimulants or @entity18			2
after controlling for other factors that can increase cardiovascular risk ( such as smoking ) , the authors found no increase in heart attack , stroke , or sudden cardiac death rates among people who were currently using an adhd drug			1
nor did they find any differences in cardiovascular risk among people who had taken @entity4 medications in the past and those taking them currently			2
@entity0 : the worst habits for your heart although the findings should allay the fears of people taking these medications , the study does n't entirely rule out the possibility of small increases in heart risk , says lead author @entity83 , @entity84 , a research scientist with the @entity85 , in @entity86 , @entity87 " our study suggests that these drugs are not associated with a markedly elevated risk , but we ca n't say that they 're completely safe , " @entity83 says			2
" it makes sense for patients and doctors to talk about the potential risks			0
" the study had several limitations that prevent firmer conclusions about the drugs ' safety			0
the researchers could n't confirm that the participants actually consumed the prescriptions they filled , for instance , and they followed the participants for an average of just 16 months			0
" that 's not a very long time for looking at cardiovascular risk , because cardiovascular risk extends over many years , " says @entity109 , @entity110 , a professor of medicine and physiology at the @entity113			0
@entity0 : surprising heart attack risks and despite being very large , the study may not have been big enough to detect small increases in risk , since heart attacks and other serious cardiovascular problems are relatively rare , says @entity124 , @entity110 , an adhd researcher at the @entity125 who wrote an editorial accompanying the study			1
indeed , only 2,228 of the study participants -- one - half of 1 % -- experienced a heart attack , stroke , or sudden cardiac death			1
more than 1.5 million adults in the @entity2 take stimulants , according to the study			0
most take the drugs for @entity4 , although doctors sometimes prescribe stimulants off - label for depression - related fatigue , narcolepsy , and other conditions			0
@entity0 : adult adhd ? tips for increasing your focus although children with @entity4 have received the lion 's share of attention from researchers and public - health officials , adults accounted for one - third of all prescriptions for @entity4 medications in 2005			0
a previous study by the same group of researchers found no link between @entity4 drugs and serious cardiovascular events in children and young adults , @entity124 notes in his editorial			2
people who take @entity4 medications should continue to be aware of less serious side effects , such as insomnia and loss of appetite , @entity124 says			0
but , he says , the study is " very reassuring " regarding cardiovascular risk			0

stimulant medications have all been shown to slightly raise blood pressure and heart rate
in 2006 , @entity28 ordered stimulant manufacturers to add warnings to their product labels
but recent large study authors found no increase in heart attack , stroke , or sudden cardiac death rates
