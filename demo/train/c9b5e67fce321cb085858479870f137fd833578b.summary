-- @entity2 premier @entity1 has criticized plans by @entity5 leaders to boycott next month 's @entity7 football finals due to the treatment by @entity10 authorities of former prime minister @entity11			1
@entity13 chancellor @entity12 has raised her concerns at @entity11 's treatment , while @entity22 president @entity21 , @entity17 president @entity16 and the governments of @entity19 and @entity20 have all said they will not be attending any matches in @entity10 in protest			1
but @entity1 has waded into the row , telling journalists in @entity2 that sport and politics should be kept separate			1
" in absolutely every case , you ca n't mix politics , business and other issues with sport , " @entity1 told @entity2 news agency @entity30			1
" i stick to the principle professed and supported by the @entity37 -- sport is outside politics			1
" @entity1 's statement echoes the sentiments of @entity42 chief @entity41 , who defended the elite motorsport 's decision to race in @entity45 last month despite widespread concerns over human rights issues			1
@entity11 , the heroine of the @entity48 that swept the country in 2004 and 2005 , has been in prison since last october for alleged abuse of office			0
her supporters claim that the charges were politically motivated -- drummed up by current president @entity55 , who beat @entity11 in @entity10 's 2010 presidential election			1
it was alleged voter fraud by supporters of @entity55 during the 2004 presidential elections that originally sparked the revolution			2
her party was expected to be a formidable foe in next october 's parliamentary elections			0
last week pictures of @entity11 released by her family appeared to show bruises she claims came from a beating by a prison guard			0
she has since gone on hunger strike in a bid to secure medical treatment she says she is being denied			0
taking place a little over a month before the @entity7 opening ceremony in @entity76 , which is co-hosting the tournament , the row is just one of several controversies that have threatened to overshadow what the @entity10 government had hoped would be a showcase event for the country			1
despite huge investment in @entity10 's aging transport infrastructure , the country has struggled in its preparations			1
stadium delays had initially put @entity10 's hosting of the tournament in jeopardy , but now new problems have emerged			1
hotel prices during the tournament have risen so sharply due to profiteering that @entity94 , head of @entity5 football 's governing body @entity95 , was unusually critical when visiting @entity10 last month for the opening of a new airport terminal			1
" it 's annoying to have made a lot of investment and then say to people that they ca n't come because there are bandits and crooks who want to make a lot of money during this @entity110 , " he told the assembled press in @entity100			2
security concerns were raised when multiple bombs exploded in the city of @entity114 , close to @entity115 where the @entity117 team will be playing some of its matches			0
more than 20 people were injured in the blasts			0
the authorities have so far blamed criminal gangs rather than terrorists for the attack			0
and earlier this week @entity125 warned football fans traveling to @entity10 that they will face a " criminal " police force mired in so many abuse scandals that its behavior threatens to ruin the showpiece tournament			1
the @entity125 report " @entity10 : @entity7 jeopardized by criminal police force " details how security forces have been implicated in numerous cases of torture and extortion in cities due to host matches			2
according to the report , one recent case in the eastern city of @entity100 -- where @entity13 , @entity141 and @entity142 will play -- details how two men were beaten , robbed and then imprisoned by six police officers after a disagreement in a bar			0
prosecutors originally refused to open a criminal case until @entity150 footage emerged of the incident after one of the men 's lawyers gave an interview to a local tv station			0
" the @entity10 government must take action now to stop widespread police criminality , " said @entity157 , @entity125 's director for @entity5 and @entity158			2
" failure to do so will encourage them to continue acting as a law unto themselves and put @entity7 fans in danger from a force that is out of control			0
" the @entity10 foreign ministry responded to the avalanche of negative press stories this week in bellicose terms			2
" the @entity178 considers destructive the attempts to politicize sporting events , which have played an important role in the process of establishment of intergovernmental mutual understanding and unity since the earliest times , " it said in a statement posted on the website of the @entity177			0
" the calls to boycott the championship would in practice amount to undermining the image of a grand sports event and damage to the interests of millions of ordinary @entity10 that vote for various political parties or are not interested in politics at all			1
" @entity76 is split on the controversy , with opposition leader @entity198 calling for a boycott of the event and suggesting that matches be moved to @entity202			2
but president @entity203 dismissed those calls as " inappropriate			0
" meanwhile @entity12 , a keen football fan whose comments earlier this week on the fate of @entity11 sparked the media furor , says that she will wait until the very last minute to decide whether to attend the tournament			0
" i always decide on such things at short notice , " she told @entity209 , a regional newspaper in @entity13			0
