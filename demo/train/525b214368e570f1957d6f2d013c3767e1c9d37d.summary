-- every day , three women die as result of abuse -- that 's nearly 1,100 killed every year			1
" that number might not mean anything to you ... unless the woman was your mother , your sister , your daughter , " @entity5 says			1
young men who admit to hitting , kicking , choking and even wanting to kill the women they claim to love are opening up to @entity5 and giving an unprecedented look inside the minds of abusers			1
men who have abused women reveal to @entity5 why they did it			1
sir says the first time he laid his hands on his wife , @entity23 , was just weeks after their wedding			1
he says he got jealous after a party where she was dancing with someone else			1
" it set me off			2
i remember walking up to her and smacking her full force , " sir says			2
" i grabbed her by her neck , and i kind of held her against the car			2
then , i walked her over to the bushes and threw her in there , and i just started choking her			2
it was with every bit of rage , every bit of anger i 've ever had			2
" after the first incident of abuse , sir says he held a gun to his head			1
" it was very hard for me to come to grips with the man that i was , " he says			2
sir promised @entity23 it would never happen again , and she forgave him			2
though sir swore to his wife that the abuse would stop , it continued for the next two - and - a - half years			1
even while @entity23 was pregnant , she says sir beat her to the point where she feared for her life			2
" she did n't want to be intimate with me , she did n't want to have sex with me and i got very furious , " sir says			1
" i got on top of her and sat on her stomach			2
" @entity23 says sir choked her and covered her nose and mouth so she could n't breathe			1
" i was just thinking : ' oh my gosh , i 'm going to die right now			2
is this really happening ? ' " @entity0 : 7 ways to end violence against women when he was in a rage and beating @entity23 , sir says he did want her to die			1
" i had every intention to take her life			2
i felt like i had power and control over something in my life , " sir says			2
" it made me feel invincible			2
" luckily , @entity23 survived the abuse			1
" by the grace of @entity81 , reality would come back to me as the rage would decrease , " sir says			2
" i look back now and i can see that at that time , when the rage would come , it was like tunnel vision			2
i would try and express my anger and my disappointment the only way i knew how			1
and that was through abuse			1
" eventually , @entity23 left sir and gave him an ultimatum -- either they would include @entity95 in their marriage or she would not return to sir			2
" i went home and gave my life to @entity95 , " sir says			2
" with that [ freedom ] came the relationship with my wife			0
it was so much better			0
" sir says it 's been about two years since he last hit @entity23			0
" if one of our arguments were to progress and continue to escalate , instead of adrenaline , it 's knots , " he says			0
" i 'll have knots in my stomach , and i 'll say , ' okay , we have to stop talking			0
' that allows me to step aside and pray and calm down			0
" @entity23 says that if sir were to ever hit her again , she would leave			1
" he has full knowledge of what he needs to be doing as a man and a father and a husband , " she says			0
" if he 's not owning up to those responsibilities , then i 'm better than that , and my kids deserve better than that			0
" @entity0 : what happens when children witness abuse ? though sir says the abuse has stopped , he admits it 's an everyday struggle			1
" if i ever think i have it under control , i 'm in trouble , " he says			0
though sir ca n't speak for all men , he believes his own abusive behavior was triggered by his past			1
" kids are precious -- they record everything , " he says			0
" i grew up in an abusive household , so i did n't know how to verbally communicate with my wife without putting her down			1
i did n't know how to verbally disagree with her and say , ' we do n't see eye to eye , ' and be okay with that			1
" does sir believe that every man who hits a woman once will hit her again ? " i say yes because i hit [ @entity23 ] more than once -- there was a second occasion , there was a third , " he says			0
" do i think it 's a cycle that can be stopped ? yes			0
" @entity155 is another man who admits to having abused a woman			0
in an e-mail to @entity5 , he said he beat a previous girlfriend so badly she bled			1
" i could n't express myself verbally , so i would take it out on her physically , " @entity155 wrote			1
" the thing that triggered me was that i was insecure as a person			0
to see her stare at another man , or to see her have a conversation with another man , or if she confronted me about anything , it enraged me			0
" though @entity155 says he knew , even in the moment , that he should n't being doing what he was doing , he says he could n't stop			1
today , he says he 's trying to make amends for his previous actions by speaking out against domestic violence whenever he can			0
" [ i want ] to say , by grace and remorse , that i 'm still here today , " he says			0
" i made it through			0
" @entity155 says it felt like he " blacked out " during the abuse			1
" you do n't understand what 's going on , " he says			1
" i completely own up to [ what i did ] , but in that rage , it 's like your brain wires , they are n't clicking			1
" he says being in an abusive relationship is like being in a drug addiction			1
" it becomes like your bond in the sense that the woman is like cocaine inside of that relationship			0
that 's the only connection you have , because there 's no real love , " he says			0
" in order to overcome it , it 's almost like you have to separate , go to rehab , move out of the dope house and never come back			0
" although physical abuse is never acceptable , sir and @entity155 say it 's the emotional abuse that leaves the deepest scars			1
" the internal abuse , the demoralizing and demeaning of a woman , lasted longer than the physical abuse , " @entity155 says			1
on the inside , you strip away their pride , force them to compromise their self - worth , their self - respect			0
" @entity155 says a grooming process tends to take place within abusive relationships			1
" in a sense , you gain their trust , but it 's all lust and lies			0
the relationship is built on deception , " he says			0
" they feel like you love them , and when you get close enough to them , you 're able to critique them and criticize them in a way that they feel like , ' he loves me , so i need to change this			0
' " the grooming , sir and @entity155 say , stems from the man 's own lack of self - worth			0
" in public i 'm a very confident male ; at home i 'm very insecure , " sir says			0
it 's an issue sir says he and his wife are still working through			0
" she still heals from the verbal abuse			1
i took almost every secret that she gave me to in an argument and threw it back at her as an insult , " he says			0
" so it took awhile to kind of have communication			0
" many people who have never experienced abuse wonder why it is n't easy for a woman to leave after the first time she 's hit			1
if a woman does leave immediately , would an abuser get the message ? " would a man continue to hit a woman who refuses to be hit ? " @entity5 asks			1
" i think it 's different for each man , " sir says			0
" to me , it could have been reversed in the sense of , ' okay , i 'm going to have to tame this now			0
' or the opposite is , ' i should n't have done that			1
