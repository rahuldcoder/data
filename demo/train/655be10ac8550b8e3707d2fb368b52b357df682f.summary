her entire body is covered in bandages			0
@entity1 , a @entity13 refugee , in her 40s , a mother of four , her wounds not a product of the violence raging in her homeland , but self - inflicted			1
@entity1 's husband , @entity14 , peers into the room from behind the glass , shock and sorrow lining his face as he listens to the woman whose smile he fell in love with 24 years ago			1
" i chose death , i chose death rather than seeing my children die a million times in front of me , " she says , speaking to us through the intercom			2
only medical staff are allowed inside the room			0
" it 's hard , it 's hard for a mother to want to feed her children			1
they burned my heart , they burned my heart before they burned my body			0
i was like an insect to them			0
" targeted aid @entity1 's story of frustration , humiliation , desperation mirrors that of countless other refugees			1
but so deep was her agony that something inside this woman -- described as being strong , eloquent -- must have snapped			0
@entity1 and her family fled to @entity54 from the @entity13 city of @entity56 nearly two years ago			1
life as a refugee was hard , making ends meet always a struggle especially putting the children -- aged 13 to 22 -- into school and university			2
three of @entity1 and @entity14 's four children have a blood disease which makes it difficult to digest certain foods and can lead to hemolytic anemia			1
the family relied on aid to get by , but about six months ago the @entity72 and @entity73 conducted a vulnerability assessment and concluded that around 30 % of refugees can meet their own needs			2
that resulted in a targeted aid campaign , and @entity1 's family was excluded			1
there is a process to appeal the exclusion , which @entity1 's family says is why she made repeated visits to a @entity72 registration center in @entity85			1
" i went to them over and over , i said you must have made a mistake			0
" they lied to me , they mocked me , they shouted at me , get out of here			0
" " i said to them if you do n't give me anything where am i going to get it from ? " @entity1 continues			2
" i am going to set myself on fire , how am i going to feed my children ? feel my pain , feel what 's in my heart , feel that i have four children			1
eyewitnesses say she arrived outside the registration center , exchanged a few words with someone before dousing herself in gasoline			0
within seconds she went up in flames			0
" she fell to the ground and just started burning , " one of the men who runs a food stall recalls			2
@entity114 response @entity0 spoke to @entity114 personnel at the center and guards outside			0
they told us @entity1 had not been mistreated			2
still , the @entity114 says it takes these allegations very seriously and is looking into them			0
@entity1 does have a protection file with @entity72 and in january an assessment was done regarding her children 's medical condition , but they have no record of her appeal			1
@entity72 says the family was also offered resettlement into communal housing , which they refused , saying they feared for their daughters ' safety among strangers			0
the @entity114 is also following up on the family 's eligibility for re-inclusion in the food program and covering all of @entity1 's medical costs			1
" i am a mother , my children were getting dizzy from the lack of food , one said i ca n't lift my head , the other said i ca n't move my legs " @entity1 recalls , regret for her actions compounding her already penetrating physical and emotional pain			1
" my heart burns for my children			0
i hope that @entity149 forgives me , i want my voice to reach all the mothers , each person who has a conscience , " she pleads			0
" i want my children to be independent , i worked very hard for their education , i worked a lot in this life for them to be able to reach university			2
" @entity14 , her husband , wipes his eyes and turns away as she says she does n't want her children to see her like this			2
she wants them to remember her the way she was			0
number of @entity13 refugees in @entity54 passes 1 million , @entity114 says			1

@entity1 , her husband and their family fled to @entity54 from their home in @entity56 , @entity13
