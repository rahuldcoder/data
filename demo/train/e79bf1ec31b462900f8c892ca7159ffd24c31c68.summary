@entity0 -- @entity4 spies " can do little but shrug " when commanders ask for the information they need to fight the @entity8 insurgency , the top @entity4 military intelligence officer in @entity10 said in a blistering report			1
@entity4 military intelligence officers in @entity10 spend too much time focusing on enemy groups and tactics and not enough on trying to understand @entity10 's culture , people and networks , maj. gen. @entity12 wrote in a report published monday			1
@entity4 military intelligence gathering is " ignorant of local economics and landowners , hazy about who the powerbrokers are and how they might be influenced , incurious about the correlations between various development projects and levels of cooperation among villagers , and disengaged from people in the best position to find answers , " @entity12 wrote click here to have your say on the damning intelligence report his report comes out less than a week after seven @entity41 officers and a @entity43 intelligence agent were killed by a double agent who set off a suicide bomb inside their base in @entity10			1
but the report is about military intelligence gathering , not the @entity41 's work , one of @entity12 's co-authors , @entity53 capt. @entity52 , told @entity1			1
" this is primarily about improving intelligence within the @entity58 , " he said via e-mail " our timing was independent of the tragic event in @entity64 , " he said , referring to the attack that killed the @entity41 officers			1
@entity12 co-wrote the report with @entity52 and @entity66 of the @entity58 's @entity67 for a @entity0 think tank , the @entity69			2
@entity12 's boss , gen. @entity73 , the top @entity4 commander in @entity10 , backs the report , a spokesman for @entity4 forces there told @entity1			1
" we support this kind of activity			0
gen. @entity73 is looking for ways to make things better , " adm. @entity77 said			1
but @entity58 spokesman @entity81 said it is " a bit irregular " that a report of this kind would come out through a think tank			2
" i think it struck everybody a bit curious , " he said			0
" my sense is this was an anomaly and we wo n't see it again			0
" he said he was not sure secretary of defense @entity94 had seen the report , though he had been provided with a copy on the day of publication			0
" the most i will say is that it was an unusual and irregular way to publish a document , " @entity81 said			0
the report said some good work is being done on the ground , and that local intelligence officers " know a great deal about their local @entity10 districts			1
" but , the report said , they " are generally too understaffed to gather , store , disseminate and digest " information			0
and , critically , they do not have the resources to gather information which could give @entity4 a better understanding of @entity10 , such as census data , patrol debriefs , minutes from councils with local farmers and tribal leaders , polling data , translated summaries of radio broadcasts that influence local farmers and the like			2
" this vast and underappreciated body of information ...			0
provides ... a map for leveraging popular support and marginalizing the insurgency itself , " @entity12 and his colleagues argue			0
as a result , " @entity4 intelligence officers and analysts can do little but shrug in response to high level decision - makers seeking the knowledge , analysis and information they need to wage a successful counterinsurgency , " they say			0
the report claims they can not answer basic questions unrelated to the military fight against the @entity8 , such as : " is that desert road we 're thinking of paving really the most heavily trafficked route ? which mosques and bazaars attract the most people from week to week ? is that local contractor actually implementing the irrigation project we paid him to put into service ? " @entity1 's @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report			2

spies focus on enemy groups , not on learning @entity10 's culture , intel officer says
report comes less than a week after seven @entity41 officers killed by double agent
