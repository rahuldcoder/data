@entity0 -- state visits to the @entity3 are full of show and symbolism , and tuesday 's visit by @entity8 prime minister @entity7 is no exception			1
but @entity7 's visit , the first state visit hosted by the @entity13 administration , reflects @entity8 's growing political and economic importance to the @entity15 and the deepening partnership between @entity0 and @entity17			1
the 2005 civil nuclear cooperation deal between the two countries symbolized a new status in @entity15 - @entity8 relations			1
but that deal , yet to be ratified by the @entity8 parliament , was not in a vacuum			0
the @entity26 administration followed that up with agreements for increased cooperation on security , science and technology and education			2
@entity7 's visit this week will build on that , with announcements expected on a range of areas from the economy and defense to climate change and energy			1
@entity8 is a fellow democracy , and there is a strong @entity8 - @entity15 community in the @entity15 so as it rises to power , @entity8 is a natural @entity15 ally			2
on every big global issue today -- from the economy to climate change to fighting terrorism and curbing nuclear proliferation -- @entity0 needs @entity17 's cooperation			1
@entity8 is one of the biggest donors in @entity55 , with $ 1.2 billion in aid			0
although this has been met with suspicion in @entity58 , it has helped the @entity15 , sharing some of the burden of stabilizing @entity55 and providing civilian support			2
@entity8 is also considered a critical @entity15 partner in dealing with other instability in the region , in places like @entity65 and @entity66			0
even as the @entity15 deepens its cooperation with @entity70 on global issues , both @entity7 's government and the @entity13 administration want to manage @entity70 's meteoric rise			0
strong @entity15 - @entity8 ties help both countries ensure that the " @entity75 " is not merely the " @entity70 century			0
" @entity8 has also become a major trading partner with the @entity15 , with $ 61 billion in trade in 2007			0
the @entity15 is @entity8 's second - largest trading partner			1
and @entity8 is a major exporter of technology software and services to the @entity15 , and that 's expected to increase as @entity8 strengthens its role as a global leader in technology			1
the relationship is not without its irritants , however , the biggest one being @entity8 's nuclear neighbor , @entity58			1
@entity8 believes the @entity15 has failed to curb @entity90 's backing of @entity92 extremists based in @entity58 , and tensions between @entity8 and @entity58 remain high , especially with @entity58 's slow progress on the investigation into last year 's @entity97 attack that killed 166 people			1
before coming to @entity0 , @entity7 said that @entity58 objectives in @entity55 are n't necessarily those of the @entity15 @entity58 has long seen instability in @entity55 as critical to its war strategy against @entity8			2
@entity8 is also nervous about a possible integration of some @entity103 into power in @entity55			0
climate change is another point of friction			0
the @entity15 wants @entity8 , one of world 's the largest emitters of greenhouse gases , to accept limits on its carbon emissions			2
@entity8 maintains it is still a developing country and wants developed nations , like the @entity15 , to assume the lion 's share of burden in dealing with climate change			1
another potential difference looms over @entity118			0
@entity8 has been careful not to support @entity118 's government , but if @entity15 diplomacy with @entity118 fails , it remains to be seen if @entity17 will support tougher sanctions if the @entity15 decides to go that route			2
as @entity8 's economy grows , so will its capability to be one of the @entity15 ' great partners			1
but as its international position strengthens , @entity17 's interests may not always be aligned with @entity0 's			0
@entity13 must work to convince @entity8 that the @entity15 sees it as an important ally and that its rise to power is in the @entity15 ' strategic interest			0
the symbolism of giving @entity7 the administration 's first state visit will be a good start .			0
