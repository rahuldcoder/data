-- the @entity1 will get to try out its scoop this weekend , according to current @entity4 plans			1
" the request that the engineers made to the scientists was : find us a good sandbox , a good sand pit , to play in here , on our way to @entity18 , " said @entity8 , @entity1 mission manager at @entity4 's @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , at a press conference thursday			1
" this site , @entity20 , is exactly that			2
" the vehicle is currently parked 400 meters as the crow flies from @entity24 , where it landed on august 6			0
it will likely stay there for another two weeks , with scooping to begin on saturday			0
@entity1 rotated its wheel around the sandy material where it is to make sure that it was loose , dry soil , @entity8 said			1
the rover will use its instruments to further determine what this sand is made of , to make sure it meets the scientists ' needs			1
the sand also serves as a sort of " mouthwash " for @entity1 to finish cleaning out its hardware , @entity4 experts said			1
there are five tools at the end of the rover 's robotic arm			0
the collection and @entity48 mechanism does scooping , processing and sample drop - off			0
what we 've done on @entity53 , and what 's next although the hardware was clean when it was assembled at @entity4 facilities , it 's impossible to avoid an oily film that accumulates as a result of being on @entity60 , said @entity61 , a sampling expert at @entity9			1
the sample analysis instrument on @entity1 is so sensitive that it needs this film scrubbed away			1
the handling of sand sample will be used as a way to accomplish this , @entity61 said			0
effectively , the rover will vibrate the sand on sensitive hardware surfaces to sand - blast them , then spit the material out and repeat three times			1
scientists were looking for a " boring " and " safe " @entity53 sand dune for this purpose to make sure that it would n't do something weird such as turn to paste or absorb water , @entity61 said			1
the rover will be performing an x-ray diffraction experiment , using a device called @entity82 , to help detect the minerals present in the sample			1
this technique has never been done before on @entity53 , said @entity86 , deputy project scientist for the rover mission			0
" even the most boring sand on @entity53 is going to be a new result in that respect			0
" mission specialists say the rover will probably end up at @entity18 around the rover 's 90th @entity53 day , and then @entity1 will pause to try out its drilling system			1
there will be a similar cleaning activity for the drill			0
days on @entity53 are about 40 minutes longer than on @entity60 , and the people working on the mission are still living on " @entity53 time			0
" in its first two months on @entity53 , @entity1 stumbled upon an area where it appears that water once flowed in a vigorous stream			2
scientists say the rover spotted rock outcrops that seem to have formed in the presence of water , with rounded gravels that may have been transported by water			2
but the rover did not linger at these sites			0
instead , drivers proceeded to command @entity1 to continue moving toward @entity18 , a site of scientific interest because it contains three types of terrain , including layered bedrock			1
" we think there 's even better versions of that same material at @entity18 , at least that 's the hypothesis , " @entity86 said			2
if that does n't pan out , @entity1 can visit some of the outcrops it 's already passed on the way back			2
after @entity18 , @entity1 is bound for a 3 - mile - high mountain called @entity126 , composed of layers of sediment that have built up over time			1
these layers may hold organic molecules , indicating that at one time life could have subsisted			0
also this week , @entity1 checked in on @entity53 using the mobile application @entity133			2
while no human will be overthrowing the rover 's check - in supremacy anytime soon , users of @entity133 can score a curiosity - themed badge when checking in at certain science - y locations			0
this program will go into effect later this year			0
read more about the @entity53 rover on @entity0 's @entity144 blog			0

" find us a sandbox , " engineers asked scientists
@entity1 will scoop up sand for mineral analysis and to clean some hardware
the rover is on its way to a site called @entity18
