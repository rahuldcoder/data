-- tuesday 's deadly suicide attack targeting @entity2 just did n't fit the pattern of what had come before in this troubled country			1
the police formed the usual cordon at the attack site -- this time a shrine in @entity10			0
sirens pierced the odd moment of eerie silence , but the police chief 's face was contorted with fury and confusion , like he 'd seen something new and troubling -- even after decades of conflict here			0
yes , the insurgency has specialized in hitting targets right in the city center , often meters away from key institutions			0
yes , they are aimed for effect			0
but mass casualty attacks like we used to see in 2009 are rare these days			1
the insurgents prefer to hit strategic targets -- unless their roadside bombs are maiming civilians elsewhere			1
and no , the @entity2 simply were n't targets before			0
@entity33 was seldom an issue here : @entity35 has lacked the @entity37 divide in @entity38 that helped to keep @entity39 in power but made his fall so bloody			0
it has been spared the brand of @entity37 extremism in @entity45 , where ruthless attacks on @entity2 are a shocking part of the fabric			2
the question of who did it was quickly answered but unsatisfactorily			0
the interior ministry here points its finger at the @entity55 , despite an effusive denial from spokesman @entity57			1
it 's arguable that an offshoot of the @entity62 - e - @entity61 movement , which reportedly rang in a claim from @entity45 , is capable of mounting a sophisticated , targeted and vicious attack in the very heart of @entity10 without some assistance			1
if they are responsible , it does require some explanation as to how a small , rogue group of extremists -- which has links to @entity73 and the @entity45 @entity55 -- could suddenly develop the capacity to penetrate the capital of a neighboring state			2
and are @entity45 extremists really operating freely inside @entity35 now ? whether the culprits turn out to be the @entity45 - based @entity79 -- the group blamed for recent high - profile and sophisticated attacks in the capital -- the @entity62 - e - @entity83 , or another complex part of @entity35 's insurgency , fractured and complicated after 10 years , many @entity35 place the blame at one source : @entity45			1
that 's the " address " that @entity10 thinks the @entity55 now resides under			2
that 's who they blame for most of the ills here , despite simultaneously hoping they will come to the negotiating table and help			0
but we should not rush to attribute blame for one reason : the advent of @entity45 extremists trying to foment sectarian violence in @entity35 at this late stage in the war is a prospect too terrifying to behold .			1
