-- two advocacy groups filed a federal complaint tuesday alleging a @entity5 school district 's treatment of three @entity7 families was discriminatory because it did not provide important information in @entity9			1
the @entity10 and @entity11 , a project of legal aid of @entity5 , filed the complaint with the @entity15 @entity17 's @entity16			1
they say that in the cases of three students and their @entity9 - speaking parents , the @entity19 failed to provide documents about the students ' suspensions in @entity9			1
that meant the parents , who speak limited @entity29 , were unable to ask questions or even appeal the suspensions , which discriminated against them on the basis of national origin and violated their civil rights , the groups say			2
the school district responded by saying it has many programs in place to support and inform @entity7 and @entity9 - speaking families			1
it also provided forms in @entity9 , including notification of suspension , a form for parents to request information on disciplinary actions , and confirmation that a parent has made an appeal			1
the school district has had the @entity9 - language forms since the mid- 1990s , said @entity53 , spokeswoman for the district 's @entity54			1
after media inquiries about the groups ' complaints , superintendent @entity56 said last month , " we have been proactively engaging all students and families in the @entity19 , including those in the @entity7 community			0
" @entity5 's capital , @entity66 , is in @entity67			1
he added that " as a district , @entity19 has developed relationships with key community groups , leaders and media partners to support the needs of our @entity9 - speaking families			1
" the district has several measures to help @entity9 - speaking families understand school policies , including @entity9 - language parental training , explanation of policies through spanish - language media and bilingual customer service representatives			1
the advocacy groups said the spanish - language forms did not help the three families in these cases			2
" whether they gave these parents the blank forms themselves in @entity9 , in no instances in these cases did they provide the form in writing with individualized information about their students in @entity9 , " said @entity87 , spokesman for @entity89 of @entity5			1
" they may have given them the form , but the form did n't include the individualized information about their students in @entity9			0
" @entity102 , the deputy legal director for the @entity10 , also said the @entity9 - language forms are often filled in using @entity29 , with descriptive information about students left out			1
" it 's inadequate , and it certainly does n't benefit the family who 's trying to participate in the child 's education , " she said			0
" these are the absolute core and key responsibilities of a school system , " she added , especially because of the number of @entity7 and @entity9 - speaking families in the @entity67 district			1
latino students comprise 15 % of the district 's student population , the advocacy groups said , and students with parents who speak limited @entity29 are 7.5 %			2
as part of the same complaint , the @entity10 is also representing an unidentified class of students and their families with the same allegation of discrimination , @entity102 said			0
the three students specifically represented by the advocacy groups , who are identified only by their initials , were all recommended for long - term suspensions and have mothers who speak limited @entity29 , the groups said			2
the first case is that of a 12 - year - old with a learning disability			0
the school 's information about his suspension was in @entity29 , so the student 's mother did n't know she could appeal , the groups said			2
the second student was a ninth - grader , also with a learning disability			0
after she was accused of smoking marijuana on campus , the school recommended she be suspended for the rest of the school year			0
the girl 's mother could not understand the assistant principal when he called to discuss her daughter 's suspension , and the mother was unable to ask questions , the groups said			0
letters about her daughter 's disciplinary actions were also in @entity29 , they said			0
in the third case , the student was suspended after being accused of marijuana possession , and the notice of his suspension was sent to the student 's mother in @entity29 only			0
the mother wanted to appeal but was n't given information in @entity9 about her son 's alleged offense			0
the mother also requested her son be tested for special education services , but all of the written information about his eligibility was in @entity29 , they said			0
by the time the mother managed to appeal her son 's suspension , he had been out of school for more than three weeks because the mother had missed the deadline because of her limited @entity29 , the groups said .			2

@entity194 filed against school district in @entity67 , @entity5
they say the district gave @entity29 forms to @entity9 - speaking families
they filed a complaint with the @entity15 @entity204
the district says it has @entity9 forms and *outreach* programs
