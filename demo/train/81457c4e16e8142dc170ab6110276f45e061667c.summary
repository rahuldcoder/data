could " preacher " become @entity2 's next " @entity1 " ? @entity2 has officially put into development the long - rumored tv version of @entity5 and @entity6 's twisted 1990s comic series			1
@entity8 ( " @entity9 " ) will serve as executive producer and showrunner , while @entity16 and @entity17 ( " this is the @entity15 " ) will executive produce and write the pilot draft			1
' @entity1 ' pranks @entity18 with zombie attacks @entity16 and @entity17 said in a statement : " this is amazing ! we 've tried for seven years to work on ' preacher ' and we 're so psyched @entity2 is finally letting us			1
it is our favorite comic of all time , and we 're going to do everything we can to do it right			2
@entity28 ! " @entity2 's official description : " ' preacher ' follows reverend @entity29 , a tough @entity30 preacher who has lost his faith , has learned that @entity32 has left @entity33 and abandoned his responsibilities			1
he finds himself the only person capable of tracking @entity32 down , demanding answers , and making him answer for his dereliction of duty			0
accompanying @entity29 on his journey is his former girlfriend and a friendly vampire who seems to prefer a pint in the pub to the blood of the innocent			0

plus , @entity5 gave fans a lengthy statement : " @entity6 and i are very happy to see ' preacher ' being developed for tv , which seems a much more natural home for the story than a two - hour movie			2
between them , @entity65 and @entity2 have brought viewers two of my favorite shows with ' @entity9 ' and ' @entity68 , ' and it 's exactly that kind of creative commitment and courage that ' preacher ' needs			1
obviously it 's taken a while , but @entity77 along with @entity78 and his team refused to give up , long after the point when i myself grew skeptical , and their unrelenting enthusiasm for the project has gotten us where we need to be			0
i 'm particularly impressed that @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity8 understand ' preacher ' fully â€” meaning they get it for what it is , not some vague approximation			1
all in all , it looks like ' preacher ' can now be brought to tv in a way that i 'd previously not have thought possible , and i very much appreciate that @entity6 and i have been included in the conversation in the way that we have			2
