-- in 1937 , @entity1 disappeared over the @entity2 attempting to circumnavigate the globe			1
later this month , @entity4 will try to do what her namesake could not			1
despite recently discovering she 's not related to the more famous @entity1 ( for years she 'd believed she was ) , the 31 - year - old pilot will attempt to become the youngest woman to navigate around the world in a single - engine aircraft			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity1 about her forthcoming record attempt			1
@entity0 : did your name spark your interest in aviation ? @entity4 : getting asked questions day in and day out about my name has always been a part of my life			1
people would say to me , " are you a pilot ? do you think you can ever fly around the world ? " and for a long time , i said , " no , i 'm not a pilot but i always thought about flying around the world			1
" it was always in the back of my mind just as an ultimate goal			0
so i took my very first discovery flight , which is basically the first flight that every pilot goes through			0
after that first discovery flight , i was totally hooked			0
@entity0 : what was your reaction when you discovered that you were n't related to @entity1 ? @entity1 : it was a blow because , for 30 years , i thought that i was related to @entity1 in some distant way			1
but it really was n't why i started flying , i wanted to fly because it 's a lot of fun			2
so at this point , i 'm almost glad that the distant relationship is n't there because it shows that you do n't have to be named after somebody famous to do something great			1
@entity0 : why recreate her flight ? @entity1 : as pilots , whenever we fly , we have a flight plan			1
we open that flight plan , and then when we return safely , we close that flight plan			0
unfortunately , when @entity1 disappeared in 1937 , she never got a chance to close her flight plan and that 's what we all , as pilots , hope to do			1
i started thinking , " what if i could symbolically close @entity1 's flight plan for her ? " @entity0 : when is the takeoff date and where will you start and end the flight ? @entity1 : we start and stop the flight in @entity65 , @entity66			2
when you look at the departure date , we 've got a three - day window from june 23 to 26			2
the reason for that is we 're doing installations on the plane : additional fuel tanks and also a satellite communications system that will allow us to livestream from the cockpit			0
@entity0 : how long will the entire trip take and how much will it cost ? @entity1 : the whole trip will take two and a half weeks			1
we 've got 17 stops in 14 countries			1
over the past year and a half , i would say close to $ 2 million is probably the total value of the trip			2
@entity0 : are you nervous about embarking on such a major endeavor ? @entity1 : my biggest fear is that the trip will just fly by and the two and a half weeks will be over before i know it			1
i 've spent years planning this and it is my passion project			2
i do n't have a lot fear around what if something goes wrong with the aircraft			2
that 's not a concern of mine at all			0
i do have realistic expectations if something happens weather-wise			0
flying around the inter-tropical convergent zone is particularly tough for pilots so i 'm paying close attention to the weather patterns there			0
@entity0 : does the legend of your namesake worry you at all ? @entity1 : not at all			1
@entity1 's disappearance unfortunately came at a time when the technology just was n't there to track her			1
but when you think about how far that 's come in the last 77 years , we 're looking at whole different world			1
i 'm flying the @entity119 which is a single - engine turboprop and it 's one of most technologically advanced planes out there			1
we 've got dual gps systems on the aircraft			2
we 've got navigation that shows us exactly where we are and exactly what point in space			0
we want to show people that ... even small planes can be very manageable over long trips like this			2
@entity0 : how do you pack for this kind of trip ? @entity1 : that is the ultimate question because you have to be very cognizant of the weight aboard the aircraft			1
@entity140 , i have to keep everything very limited			0
so we 'll pack a certain amount of nutritional products			0
beauty products , i have to keep to a bare minimum , unfortunately			0
@entity0 : what do you do when you 're not flying ? @entity1 : i 'm really close with my girlfriends here in @entity150			2
we will go running together , do stuff outside together			0
trips or getting out of town , that 's pretty much to a minimum			0
i did just have a chance to go to @entity158 , @entity159 , for an aviation conference			0
that was a chance to relax even though we were working the whole time			0
things like that , where you 're working and playing , i like to blur those lines as much possible			0
when i 'm always playing and always working , that 's when i 'm happiest			0
