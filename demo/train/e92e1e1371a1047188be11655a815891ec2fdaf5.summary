-- overweight and obese adults who followed the @entity3 program lost more than twice as much weight as those who received weight - loss advice from a doctor or nurse , according to a new yearlong study funded by the company			1
the study , which was published wednesday in the @entity12 , included 772 men and women in @entity15 , @entity16 , and the @entity17 who were recruited during ordinary doctor 's appointments			0
the researchers randomly selected about half of the participants to receive a free 12 - month @entity3 membership ( including access to weekly meetings ) , and encouraged the other half to attend monthly one - on - one weight - management sessions at their doctor 's office			1
the 61 % of @entity3 users who stuck with the program for a full year lost 15 pounds , on average , compared with 7 pounds among the 54 % of people in the other group who continued to visit their doctors each month			1
when the researchers included the people who dropped out of either program before the year was up , the average weight loss was lower but followed the same pattern : 11 pounds in the @entity3 group and 5 pounds in the other group			1
@entity0 : 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day @entity45 , @entity46 , an endocrinologist at the @entity47 , in @entity48 , @entity49 , says it 's only natural that the weekly weigh - ins and " group spirit " of programs such as @entity3 would prove more effective than occasional guidance from a doctor or nurse , since research has shown that dieters are more likely to stick with weight - loss programs that stress accountability			2
" it 's not terribly surprising that a group whose whole career is basically helping people with weight management would do a better job than a primary - care group that has a lot more responsibilities on top of that , " says @entity45 , who was not involved in the study			0
similar studies of other commercial weight - loss systems , such as @entity76 and prepackaged food programs , have produced comparable results in the past			1
in a 2010 study funded by @entity76 and published in the @entity84 , for instance , women who completed one year of the program lost about 20 pounds , three or four times more than women who received occasional advice from a nutritionist			2
@entity0 : 25 diet - busting foods you should never eat still , the authors of the new study say they were surprised by how dedicated the @entity3 participants were — they attended three meetings a month , on average — and by how much weight they actually lost			1
" i do n't think we could have predicted that people randomly allocated to @entity3 by their doctor — rather than choosing to attend of their own accord , which would give a selected group of probably more motivated people — would lose significantly more weight , " says lead author @entity96 , @entity97 , a diet and population health researcher at the @entity17 @entity99 , in @entity100			2
people may be more likely to stick with a program like @entity3 when they 're participating free of charge , however			0
the cost of @entity3 can run as high as $ 500 per year , a price tag that could sap the motivation of real - world dieters who are paying out of pocket			0
at the same time , @entity45 says , it 's possible that some people paying out pocket might be less likely to drop the program because they 'd feel obligated to get their money 's worth			0
@entity0 : best superfoods for weight loss the study participants had a body mass index ( @entity127 ) between 27 and 35 and at least one additional risk factor for obesity - related disease , such as excess belly fat or a family history of diabetes			1
( people with a @entity127 over 25 and 30 are considered overweight and obese , respectively			0
a 5 - foot , 6 - inch woman with a @entity127 of 27 weighs 167 pounds			0
) people in the @entity3 group were three times more likely than the other participants to lose 10 % or more of their initial body weight			1
and nearly two - thirds of the @entity3 users lost 5 % or more of their body weight , versus one - third in the other group			2
" those really are medically very significant numbers , " @entity45 says			0
" for overweight or obese people , that kind of loss results in pretty substantial improvements in health and disease risk — to the point where , if you 're on medication for blood pressure or cholesterol or diabetes and you can [ lose ] 10 % of your weight , you 've got at least a reasonable chance of decreasing or discontinuing that medication			2
" @entity0 : the 10 best foods for your heart @entity165 and her colleagues say that partnerships between primary care physicians and commercial weight - loss programs like @entity3 could be an effective and inexpensive way to treat certain people who struggle to maintain a healthy weight			1
a cost - benefit analysis will be needed to determine whether doctors should recommend such programs to their patients more often , and which patients might benefit the most , @entity165 says			0
but , she adds , the programs appear to be promising and may be more cost - effective than one - on - one doctor 's appointments , not to mention untreated obesity complications			0
although @entity3 sponsored the study , @entity165 stresses that the company had no control over the design or results			1
" our research contract included a clause to allow us the right to publish the data regardless of the outcome , " she says			0

people lost more on @entity3 than with docs ' advice , @entity3 study says
studies of other weight loss plans have had comparable results
researchers were surprised at participants ' dedication
weight *watchers* funded the study but had no control over design or results
