@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the @entity5 private whose disclosure of hundreds of thousands of @entity9 military and diplomatic documents gave @entity9 officials a global case of heartburn , was sentenced to more than three decades in prison wednesday			1
a military judge sentenced @entity3 to 35 years -- less than the 60 prosecutors sought and far shorter than the 90 he could have received -- minus credit for the about three and a half years he 's already been behind bars			1
he showed little to no reaction when the judge , @entity5 col. @entity19 , sentenced him at @entity0 , outside @entity20			0
but in a statement read by his attorney afterward , he said he acted " out of a love for my country and a sense of duty , " to expose what he said were abuses committed in the wars in @entity26 and @entity27			1
the attorney , @entity32 , said the statement was part of @entity3 's application for a pardon from president @entity36			1
" if you deny my request for a pardon , i will serve my time knowing that sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society , " the statement said			2
" i will gladly pay that price if it means we could have a country that is truly conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all women and men are created equal			0
" @entity49 spokesman @entity48 had no comment on a possible pardon , saying only that @entity3 's request would be considered " like any other application			1
" @entity3 's lawyer : he should not ' rot in jail ' @entity3 , 25 , was convicted in july of stealing 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos and disseminating them to @entity59 , the online anti-secrecy group			1
@entity19 also reduced his rank from private first class to private , ordered him to forfeit pay and benefits and be dishonorably discharged			0
" we 're still here fighting for you @entity3 ! " a supporter yelled as @entity3 was hustled out of the courtroom			2
" we love you @entity3 ! " another said			2
an aunt and a cousin of @entity3 's wept openly in the courtroom			1
@entity3 was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against him , including violations of the @entity9 @entity74			2
he avoided a potential life sentence when @entity19 rejected charges that his actions aided the enemy			0
@entity19 already had agreed to reduce @entity3 's sentence by 112 days after ruling that the harsh treatment he was subjected to in the brig at the @entity83 base in at @entity84 , @entity85 , was out of line			1
@entity3 will be eligible for parole in 10 years , @entity32 said			2
in the meantime , he called on @entity36 " to focus on protecting whistleblowers , instead of punishing them			0
" the sentencing wraps up a case of what prosecutors called the biggest leak of classified materials in @entity5 history			2
the documents included field reports from @entity5 units in @entity26 and @entity27 , video of a @entity9 helicopter attack that killed two journalists in @entity26 and unvarnished assessments of other countries ' leaders by @entity9 diplomats overseas			0
prosecutors have said @entity3 acted as a " determined insider " in leaking classified information about the wars in @entity26 and @entity27 , arguing his actions created grave risk , disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives			1
@entity59 founder @entity114 , who last week criticized what he called a " forced " apology by @entity3 , said the sentence was " a significant tactical victory " for the defense			1
but he called @entity3 's prosecution " an affront to basic concepts of @entity124 justice			1
" " mr. @entity3 's treatment has been intended to send a signal to people of conscience in the @entity9 government who might seek to bring wrongdoing to light , " @entity114 , now holed up in the @entity126 's embassy in @entity127 , said in a written statement			1
" this strategy has spectacularly backfired , as recent months have proven			0
instead , the @entity36 administration is demonstrating that there is no place in its system for people of conscience and principle			0
as a result , there will be a thousand more @entity146			0
" but the chairman of the @entity148 , rep. @entity149 , criticized what he called a light sentence compared to the life terms some convicted spies have received			0
" @entity3 betrayed his country , his obligations as a soldier and the trust of all @entity9			2
he put the lives of our troops and our allies in danger , " @entity149 , @entity158 , said in a written statement			0
" given the vast damage he did to our national security and the need to send a strong signal to others who may be tempted to disclose classified information , this is a dangerous conclusion , " @entity149 added			1
judge explains verdict the disclosure of more than 250,000 cables from @entity9 embassies in late 2010 came in for particular criticism , with @entity180 officials arguing the leaks would make it harder for @entity20 to get accurate appraisals of the countries where @entity9 diplomats work			0
a @entity2 analysis of the first batch of cables @entity59 published found 170 that named sources whose identity was meant to be protected			0
but in 2011 , the human rights group @entity191 said the leaked documents helped galvanize opposition to longtime @entity196 strongman @entity195 @entity194 by revealing the depth of his government 's corruption			0
@entity194 was toppled by a popular uprising that january -- the first of the " @entity205 " revolutions still roiling the @entity204			0
capt. @entity206 , the prosecutor , said @entity3 's arrogance meant that he " felt he alone was knowledgeable and intelligent enough to determine what information was to be classified			1
" " there may not be a soldier in the history of the @entity5 who displayed such an extreme disregard " for his mission , @entity206 said monday during final sentencing arguments			1
but @entity32 said @entity3 was " a young man capable of being redeemed " and urged @entity19 to hand down " a sentence that allows him to have a life			2
" he told reporters later that @entity3 's case should be seen as a watershed in the debate over secrecy that 's now raging in the @entity9			1
" the ultimate role of oversight in @entity9 has always belonged to the @entity9 people , and it 's only to the extent that the @entity9 people can be informed as to these matters that oversight works at all , " he said			0
" there are too many things we do n't know about our national security apparatus			0
" @entity3 apologizes , tells court he must pay price @entity2 's @entity238 contributed to this report .			2

@entity3 will seek a pardon , says he acted " out of a love for my country "
@entity114 says case will yield " a thousand more @entity251 "
