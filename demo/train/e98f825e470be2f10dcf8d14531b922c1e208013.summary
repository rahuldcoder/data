@entity0 , the emerging if still somewhat mysterious digital currency , may be coming soon to a high - tech @entity2 near you			1
kiosks that allow people to buy the virtual coins , or exchange them for cash , will be installed within the next month or so in @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity11 , according to @entity12 , the @entity14 - based company that makes the machines			1
they will be the first such atms in the @entity17			2
@entity18 has installed machines in @entity20 , @entity21 , with more in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 in the works			0
the emergence of public atms , the company says , is a step toward making @entity0 , a currency that 's not backed by a government or bank and has no physical assets to prop up its value , a more comfortable buy for mainstream users outside the @entity39 circles where it currently thrives			1
" we think it 's a huge breakthrough when it comes to bringing accessibility to the consumers , " @entity18 ceo @entity41 said			0
since its inception in 2009 , @entity0 has fluctuated wildly in value			1
currently , a single @entity0 is worth about $ 636			1
that value was as high as $ 1,000 in december as investors began leaping into the currency			0
some traditional businesses , including online retailer @entity53 , some @entity55 sandwich shops and @entity57 's @entity56 , have begun accepting @entity0			1
but the anonymous nature of the currency also has linked it with less reputable outlets			0
@entity0 and other digital " cryptocurrencies " have been the de facto payment system on underground websites that deal in drugs , weapons and other illegal merchandise			1
last week , the anonymous owners of black - market website @entity68 announced that hackers had stolen $ 2.7 million worth of @entity0			1
in separate incidents , several online @entity0 exchanges have been taken down by hackers who exploited a flaw to create fake transactions			1
@entity77 wants his company 's machines to help the currency shed its shadier associations , even if that means alienating some supporters who like the mostly anonymous nature of @entity0 exchanges			1
" we 're trying to move @entity0 , put it in the mainstream , bring it to the masses , " he said			2
" to do that , some things have to go by the wayside , and one of them is anonymity			0
" to create a @entity18 account , a user enters their mobile phone number at one of the kiosks			0
the machine sends a code to that phone and , after the user enters the code , they are asked to scan the palm of their hand			0
" your phone is your user id and your palm is your password , " @entity110 said			0
the user is then asked to insert a driver 's license or other government - issued @entity113 , further personalizing their account as well as providing @entity121 an opportunity to verify the user 's name against government watch lists for terrorists or others who may not legally do business in the machine 's home country			2
then , the user takes a photo at the kiosk , which must be verified as a match with the picture on their id card			0
once their account is verified , a process @entity77 said takes two to five minutes , they are free to buy @entity0 at the kiosk			2
customers may either transfer them to an account , using a private code the machine dispenses , or use a smartphone app to store them on their phone			0
@entity18 sells the machines for $ 20,000			2
owners make money by charging a small transaction fee to use them , @entity77 said .			0

@entity121 , based in @entity14 , will install two atms for @entity0
the machines will be in @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity9
the @entity2 will let users swap @entity0 for cash with valid id
a @entity0 currently is worth about $ 636
