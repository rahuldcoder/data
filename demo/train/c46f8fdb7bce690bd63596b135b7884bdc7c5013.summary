-- about 200 @entity2 educators spent part of their holiday vacation in class themselves -- learning how to handle a gun			1
those who attended the free , specially tailored concealed carry permit session near @entity8 included school secretaries , substitutes and full - time teachers			1
whether they were committed to bringing a gun into school or simply giving themselves the option , they were united in their desire to learn more			2
" i 'm not really sure where i want to go with this , but i certainly think its good to be educated , " said @entity16 , the financial secretary at @entity17 in @entity18			0
" i know we have had concealed weapons in the building , and i know it made me feel safer			1
" the idea of a @entity2 teacher having a loaded weapon in class is n't new , nor is it illegal			1
still , thursday 's class received attention in the wake of this month 's massacre at a @entity36 elementary school , as well as @entity39 ceo @entity38 pitch that his advocacy organization can help facilitate the arming of more educators			1
mostly @entity44 politicians , teacher 's groups and mayors -- including @entity49 's @entity48 , @entity51 's @entity50 and @entity53 's @entity52 -- have blasted this proposal			1
for them , the focus policywise should be ensuring there are n't firearms in schools , not bringing more of them in			2
@entity39 president clarifies group 's stance on weapons in schools " guns have no place in our schools			1
period , " @entity70 and @entity71 , the presidents of the two biggest @entity75 teachers ' unions , said in a joint statement			2
" we must do everything we can to reduce the possibility of any gunfire in schools , and concentrate on ways to keep all guns off school property and ensure the safety of children and school employees			1
but to @entity88 -- president of the @entity90 , which ran thursday 's event in @entity92 -- it 's a matter of giving teachers , school administrators , janitors and others the same rights , when licensed , to carry a concealed weapon in their place of work as others have			1
" what we 're talking about is not arming teachers , " he said , contending that the approach of locking doors and hiding behind a desk " just is n't doing it anymore			2
" " we 're simply not taking away that ability of lawful self - defense within a school			0
" for 12 years , @entity2 educators have been able to do just that , even if only a small fraction do bring guns into their workplace			1
the state 's concealed weapon law allows for a person to have , on his person or in a secure lockbox , a weapon inside a school , @entity117 said			1
if they do have a loaded gun , their principals , school districts , and local police departments would n't even know , given the restrictions in place limiting who is told about who has a concealed weapons permit			1
opinion : teachers with guns a crazy idea @entity117 told @entity0 that , since this law took effect , there have been no accidents or incidents involving educators ' firearms in @entity2 schools , nor have there been school shootings in the state			1
the aim of thursday 's six - hour training sessions is n't to make educators into commandos roaming the halls to engage in shootouts with school shooters , he said			2
rather , it 's to give them one more option -- should the lockdown policies fail , law enforcement officers do n't arrive on time , and a gunman makes his way into their room			0
" when that shooter gets into the classroom , the teacher does n't need to do a lot of tactical training to access and engage a firearm , " said @entity117 , who is an instructor at thursday 's session			0
" point it at the shooter , ( who ) is probably going to be 5 to 10 feet away , and press the trigger -- thereby alleviating that option of jumping in front of the kids to soak up the bullets			0
" @entity179 , a @entity180 and stagecraft teacher at @entity181 , said she will do everything she can to protect her students			0
and she does n't want to regret not having done everything she can , should a gunman enter her school			0
" i 'm here because i do n't want to be a statistic , and i do n't want to lose any of my kids , " she said in between sessions thursday , adding that several parents have asked her if she 'd consider carrying a gun during school			0
" if somebody is coming after my kids , they 're going down and going down hard			0
" @entity179 was among the roughly 200 who went to the class thursday , which had only been announced a few days earlier , a response that @entity117 described as " overwhelming			0
" they were taught things like how to handle and secure their firearm , plus applicable laws -- a class that , except for one hour devoted to what to do in school shooting scenarios , any other qualified @entity2 could take			1
" this is nothing new for @entity2 , " @entity117 said			2
" you just have n't heard of it before			0
" some in attendance thursday were on the fence about whether they 'd personally bring a weapon to school			0
still , there was a widely shared sentiment that school would be safer if more trusted educators , beyond an armed guard standing watch at the front door , had guns			0
" the sooner these gunmen ... face opposition , the sooner the carnage will stop , " said @entity220 , an independent filmmaker who substitutes in @entity8 's @entity221			0
" if i was a parent , i 'd be ok with it as long as the people carrying the weapons were prepared , responsible and knew what they were doing			2
" opinion : look to @entity230 in changing our gun culture journalist @entity233 contributed to this report .			0

new : not all at class say they *'ll* bring in a gun , but they support having armed teachers
those in the free , concealed weapons class learned about laws , safety and more
*critics* have ripped the @entity39 's proposal to facilitating have more armed people in schools
but some @entity2 teachers have been able to carry concealed weapons in class for years
