-- just as @entity2 's revolution took the world by surprise , so did president @entity6 's unexpected assertion of presidential power so soon after he came into office			1
on august 12 , @entity6 forced field marshal @entity9 and his heir apparent , lt. gen. @entity11 , to retire			1
no one was prepared for @entity6 , a former leader of the @entity13 , to pull the proverbial rug out from under the two most powerful and widely hated military officials and to reassert civilian power			1
in hindsight , @entity6 foreshadowed his move against the military in his inaugural speech when he declared that " no institution is above the state			1
" in what has become almost second nature in @entity2 since the revolution , people took to the streets to express their political views			1
following @entity6 's announcement , @entity29 was instantly filled with supporters -- a powerful reminder of who motivated @entity6 to make his bold move			1
while ordinary people have shown their approval , the same forces that supported @entity37 's regime now insinuate that @entity6 has taken his first step toward dictatorship			1
they dismiss the possibility that @entity6 is fulfilling hopes of the revolution that brought him to power , and that he has a right to claim powers that come with his presidency			1
by unseating @entity9 and @entity11 , @entity6 responded to the longstanding demands of the revolutionary forces as well as ridding @entity2 of the handicap of a two - heads - of - state system			1
" @entity54 , down with military rule " has been chanted by revolutionaries since @entity9 replaced @entity37			0
no wonder the activist @entity56 and the @entity58 coalition were among the first to publicly support @entity6 's brilliant tactic			1
@entity6 himself has explained that he has acted in the interests of the nation by fulfilling the aspirations of the revolution			1
however , much more needs to be done			0
the revolutionaries have called for the retrial of @entity37 's acquitted regime heads and prosecution of @entity9 and @entity11 for their crimes against civilian protesters			0
@entity6 has opted instead for a more pragmatic " safe exit " for @entity9 and @entity11 , even bestowing them with decorations on their way out			0
@entity6 should pardon more if not all civilian protesters -- some 12,000 in total -- who are still being held in military detention			2
so far , @entity6 appears to be sensitive to the @entity2 street			1
recognizing his own diminishing popularity as well as the declining approval ratings of the @entity13 and the @entity80 that it dominates , @entity6 may feel the need to do more before august 24 , when nationwide demonstrations against the @entity13 are scheduled to take place			0
the two hard - won gains of the revolution -- civic participation and democratic processes -- have empowered @entity2 to engage actively in politics			2
the real force behind any change in @entity2 comes down to ordinary citizens who flex their political muscles			0
@entity93 , a taxi driver in @entity95 who voted for the first time in 67 years , spoke for many when he said : " i did n't like either of them ( presidential candidates @entity6 and @entity100 ) , but i like the system			0
... you have to take risks to bring about change , but these things take time			0
" everywhere in @entity95 , people are talking politics			0
nothing , including the opaque control of possibly 40 % of the @entity2 economy by military - connected entities , is taken for granted			2
for @entity6 , it might have been riskier not to act			0
@entity2 are growing impatient with the lack of noticeable change in political life while the country 's economy continues to slump			2
@entity119 's @entity2 polls indicate that @entity121 voters have the same priorities for government as secular voters : economic growth and security			2
distractions like the social issues pursued by the @entity13 - dominated @entity80 will not satisfy most @entity2			0
maybe this is why a @entity6 representative announced that the president is inclined to further changes , including reforming the unpopular @entity133 , which is charged with writing the @entity134			2
the jury is still out on @entity136			2
he will be hard - pressed to meet the demands of economic and social justice that fueled the revolution			0
@entity6 's new appointments send mixed signals			1
he replaced @entity9 with gen. @entity142 as defense minister			0
although @entity142 has good relations with the @entity145 , he is known for defending the barbaric " virginity tests " performed by the military during the revolution			0
arguably , the appointment of reformist judge @entity150 as vice president ( which has garnered little attention in the @entity153 ) holds greater promise and significance for @entity2 's future			1
what will @entity6 do next ? will he deliver what the revolutionaries have hoped for ? or will he move in the @entity13 's regressive direction , evident in their recent censorship of the press ? we will find out soon			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 and @entity167 .			0

@entity166 , @entity169 : @entity2 's new president took the world by surprise
@entity166 , @entity169 : president @entity6 forced two powerful military officials to retire
they say perhaps @entity6 is genuine about fulfilling the aspirations of the revolution
@entity166 , @entity169 : the jury is still out on @entity136 , early signs are mixed so far
