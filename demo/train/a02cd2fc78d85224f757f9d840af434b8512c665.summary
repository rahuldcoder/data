-- @entity1 , an online music store and " free locker " for digital music , was rolled out to the public on wednesday			1
on thursday , however , questions abounded as to whether the service will amount to simply a " me too " move , following @entity10 and @entity12 's well - worn trail through the digital - music forest , or a significant step toward making @entity1 an e-music player			1
and while much of the always ready - to - attack tech blogosphere was less than enthusiastic , it 's legitimate to ask whether that 's even the real question			1
in a way , the product is just one more front in the battle between @entity24 and @entity10			2
away from the desktop , @entity26 users must have an @entity29 , @entity30 or other @entity10 device to play the music , movies and other content they download			2
by selling more widely usable mp3s , @entity1 will be viable across multiple devices			1
and , of course , @entity1 would prefer you to choose a device running its android operating system			2
" in the end , this is n't about helping @entity1 ' catch up to @entity26 ' -- it 's about filling the big , gaping , musical hole in @entity1 's mobile business , " @entity40 wrote for @entity41 while no single @entity24 phone has approached the popularity of the @entity30 , @entity24 smartphones as a whole have become a serious force , capturing more than half the overall market during the last quarter			1
( @entity24 phones amounted to 52 % of the global market compared to about 15 % for the @entity30 , according to @entity54 )			2
@entity56 's @entity55 , who it 's safe to say was unimpressed with @entity1 's offering , says that nothing that was rolled out on wednesday would entice @entity26 or @entity12 users to switch			1
@entity1 is expected to soon offer 13 million songs from three of the four top record labels ( @entity62 balked ) as well as independent bands and includes free cloud storage for up to 20,000 songs			0
( @entity10 's similar @entity66 costs $ 25 a year )			0
" the technologies might be current , but the ideas behind @entity1 are tired , " @entity55 wrote			0
" speaking of old and tired , were you really pining away for another a la carte music store ? probably not			0
most of us have been buying tracks from @entity26 and @entity12 for years			0
" but : is enticing users to switch even the goal ? for someone trying to decide between buying an @entity10 or @entity24 device , @entity26 could be a deciding factor			1
@entity1 , at least in part , could take that bullet out of @entity10 's gun			2
" there are two things the critics decline to acknowledge : that @entity1 is providing a simple , free service , and that all @entity1 products start out underwhelming and gradually expand , " @entity81 wrote for @entity82			0
" @entity24 was a mess when it showed up			0
and it 's still a mess -- a mess blowing up to the tune of half a million devices a day			0
" and with a long - term investment of resources ( and , presumably , the successful wooing of more record labels ) , the @entity1 vs. @entity26 tilt could eventually rival the current iphone vs. @entity24 fight			1
" @entity10 now faces its arch rival in the retail - music sector where @entity10 is a juggernaut , " wrote @entity98 's @entity97			0
" but it also means that @entity26 will face a company with deep pockets , a history of success in music ( @entity107 is one of the popular music distributors on the @entity110 ) and popular consumer devices , @entity24 phones and tablets , that can help market the music store			1
this is something few previous rivals possessed			0
" but first , @entity1 will have to get over the cool reception the launch got in some quarters , largely dinging the company for lacking innovation in a product that got a star - studded , splashy roll - out .			1

by offering mp3s , @entity1 can be used on a host of devices
some tech *writers* were cool to @entity1 's rollout , saying it 's nothing new
but @entity1 gives @entity24 devices an @entity26 - like *option*
