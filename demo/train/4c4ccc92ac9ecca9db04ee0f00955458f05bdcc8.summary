-- a possible threat posed by thousands of westerners who have been drawn to @entity5 by the ongoing civil war has become a top worry among counter-terrorism officials in @entity9 and the @entity10 , fbi director @entity1 said friday			1
dozens of @entity10 residents have gone to @entity5 , made plans or attempted to go , @entity1 told reporters			1
of equal concern , he said , were citizens of @entity9 and other countries who can easily enter the @entity10 because of visa - waiver agreements			1
he drew comparisons to the thousands of foreigners who received military training in @entity24 in the 1980s and 1990s , after first being drawn with @entity10 encouragement to fight communism and then to join militant factions during the @entity24 civil war			2
some of those fighters became @entity31 operatives , he noted , drawing a line from the @entity24 war to the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the @entity10			2
" there 's going to be a diaspora out of @entity5 , " @entity1 said			1
" and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from @entity5 today to a future 9/11			0
" the comments came in a meeting with reporters at @entity43 headquarters that covered a number of topics			1
@entity1 said his agency was working with police around the country to try to help them respond to , and possibly thwart , mass shootings			0
he said the @entity43 's @entity50 is now providing advice to police in cases where they discover a possible plot in the planning stage			0
in the past week , he said , with the @entity43 's help , one police agency was able to intervene and get a person to mental health treatment , possibly stopping an attack			0
@entity1 declined to provide more details about the incident			0
@entity1 also said police agencies around the country are now getting @entity43 training to do cyber investigations			1
as more crime moves from the street to online , more victims of theft could be helped by local police who are trained to do such investigations			0
that would allow the @entity43 to better use its limited resources , he said			0
" our strategy is for the @entity43 to try and focus its resources on the national security intrusions , and the largest most sophisticated criminal operations , " @entity1 said .			2
