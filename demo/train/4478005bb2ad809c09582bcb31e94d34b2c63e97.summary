-- when the man destined to become @entity4 's next leader enters a circa 1866 @entity6 house in @entity7 , @entity8 , on wednesday , things will feel familiar			1
it was here in the town 's historic district that @entity13 first feasted on @entity8 beef and corn during a visit more than two decades ago			1
wednesday , the menu is a tad more upscale -- tenderloin , spring rolls and bacon - wrapped scallops			2
and the excitement , decidedly more palpable			0
after all , back in 1985 , @entity13 was a provincial official from the hog - farming region of @entity24 , @entity8 's " sister state			1
" he wanted to see how @entity25 raised their livestock and learn about different applications of corn , said @entity29 , owner of the @entity6 and host of @entity13 's visit			1
she would have been thrilled to have another @entity24 province official visit quiet @entity7			1
she 's honored and humbled that @entity13 chose to see his old friends again			1
in the @entity25 for a five - day visit , @entity13 , who is widely expected to become the next @entity37 leader and president of @entity40 's economic powerhouse , met tuesday with president @entity41 and other top @entity25 officials in @entity43			1
@entity41 and @entity13 discuss economics , human rights but part of wednesday is reserved for a private visit to this small eastern @entity8 town known for farming , the largest @entity51 plant outside of @entity52 and factories that used to spit out billions of mother - of - pearl buttons			1
that was before the refinement of plastic			0
now with @entity13 's visit , the global spotlight will shine on @entity7 , if only for an hour on wednesday			1
the town has never seen so many security personnel			0
nor have the high school boys swim champions had to share headlines before in the local newspaper			0
as @entity8 gov. @entity66 put it : this is the biggest thing to hit @entity7 since @entity70 's visit in 1979			1
@entity71 , editor of the @entity72 , said he had received thousands of e-mails from journalists around the world who were curious about @entity13 's visit			1
" it 's obviously a pretty big deal , " said @entity71 , " you never know what will come as a result of this kitchen - table diplomacy			2
" that kind of one - on - one relationship made an impression on @entity13 on his first trip to @entity8			1
" when you get the opportunity to meet somebody in their home or in a private setting , you get to know them differently than at a state dinner , " @entity71 said			0
" clearly that worked on mr. @entity13 when he was here 27 years ago			2
" rewind to a time when @entity96 was ascending to the leadership of the @entity98 , @entity94 was taken hostage in @entity100 and @entity101 was just another place in @entity103			0
@entity13 arrived in @entity7 for two weeks in april 1985 with a @entity4 delegation looking into farming technology			1
@entity106 , president of @entity107 , recalled how @entity13 discussed globalization , its scope then unimaginable to many @entity25			1
" here we are 27 years later and it sure is , " said @entity106 about the global economy			0
his own company now exports food and pet products to @entity4			2
back then , @entity106 escorted @entity13 on a tour of a corn processing plant			0
at times , the language barrier was hard to overcome			0
how do you translate words like centrifuge ? @entity106 gestured heavily and drew drawings in the sand to explain things to his @entity4 visitor			0
he kept a tin of black tea that @entity13 presented to him as a memento of the visit			2
after all these years , the tin is preserved half full			0
for all the talk of trade between @entity43 and @entity103 , in @entity7 it will all be very personal			0
" he is coming only to visit old friends , " @entity29 said			1
it has been a lot of work , a bit crazy for a one - hour visit , @entity29 said			2
but it 's worth it to have an old friend back			0
both @entity29 and @entity106 have given thought to what they might say when they come face - to - face with @entity4 's presumptive next president			1
" it 's a bit daunting when i think about it , so i do n't try to think about it very much , " @entity106 said			0
" it 's telling to me that he 's coming here			0
he understands the importance of long - term friendships			0
" @entity29 said she was n't nervous until she woke up tuesday			0
" what can you say when you have one minute to say it ? " @entity29 said she will talk about building a bridge to friendship in the future , and hope that @entity8 can set a global example			2
it 's not often @entity7 residents have a chance to do that .			2

@entity13 is *scheduled* to visit @entity7 , @entity8 , on wednesday
presumed to be @entity4 's next president , @entity13 visited the town in 1985 as a provincial official
@entity29 will be host to @entity13 on this visit , part of his five - day @entity25 trip
" he is coming only to visit old friends , " @entity29 said
