-- @entity2 transportation security officers are probably the least understood and most maligned of federal employees			1
travelers hate them for taking away water bottles and making them take off their shoes			0
if a story is reported about them , it 's along the lines of a little old lady getting groped			0
they are the victims of unflattering stereotypes that make easy targets for cheap laughs			0
even president @entity17 made a joke about pat - downs in a @entity20			1
and when the @entity22 found increased @entity24 officer misconduct , it just ratcheted up their unpopularity			0
the report was jarring and disturbing -- rising numbers of absenteeism , theft and intentional security lapses			2
obviously , these are red flags that ca n't be ignored			0
report : @entity24 employee misconduct up 26 % in 3 years unfortunately , instead of taking on the issue of stopping the misconduct , @entity22 's focus was on how @entity24 " could strengthen oversight of allegations of employee misconduct , " the safe issues of process oversight , management of the accusations and data gathering versus digging into the controversial root causes of the actual misconduct			0
@entity24 's response was to assure us it fires those proven to have violated the public trust			0
in fact , it does			0
it will be tempting for @entity24 leaders to rally around solutions involving tougher discipline , deeper investigations and more thorough documentation			0
that would be exactly the wrong way to fix the real problem			0
in today 's @entity24 , too many officers switch off their minds in favor of just finishing out the shift without rocking the boat			2
this may be the root cause of the @entity22 - identified misdeeds			2
@entity24 needs to have its officers switched - on and motivated			1
the security workforce comprises many who stepped up after 9/11 to stop terror attacks			1
my experience with transportation security officers is that they are overwhelmingly dedicated , sharp , willing and empathetic to passengers and their problems			1
as the @entity79 correctly pointed out in an editorial : " @entity24 asks its officers to enforce rules of questionable utility while giving them remarkably little discretion			1
... that is a huge waste of human talent			0
" inside look at @entity24 bomb training considering that the human brain is the most sophisticated technology on the planet and that the officers have experience with hundreds of thousands of passengers , the question would seem to be : " how do we get the most from this resource that we already pay and have on duty at checkpoints ? " it is not through additional rules and a more robust disciplinary process			1
security officers are in the best position to use their experience and training and detect a threat not covered in the @entity107			1
@entity108 knows the rules and designs its attacks to comply with it			2
to stop attacks , officers thinking on their own needs to be encouraged , not disciplined			1
once officers are allowed to think for themselves , it opens the door for mistakes and criticism			1
but people can be taught the fundamentals of risk management , which provides a framework for making informed judgments			0
the risk strategy must be carefully thought out -- complexity theory , with its network orientation , is the best way to think about transportation security risk -- and risk management tools understood and applied			1
a nation with no airline security armed with substantial intelligence resources , @entity24 's air marshals , inspectors and security officers need to be nimble in thinking about and applying the principles of risk management			1
but they also must be empowered to act			2
@entity24 needs to make these changes right now to take on the root causes of its public and security issues			2
it needs to clean up the mind numbing , overly complicated checkpoint " standard operating procedure , " which no longer matches our security needs and allow officers to act			1
what needs to be changed : the intrusive pat - down needs to be discontinued in favor of a lighter technique supplemented with available technologies			1
the " prohibited items " list needs to be radically reduced to ban only real security threats such as explosives and toxins			1
as far as carrying knives , the @entity158 should make it a serious federal offense to intimidate a member of the flight crew or another passenger with a blade -- and then @entity24 can remove blades from the prohibited list			0
blades represent virtually no threat to the aircraft at this point			0
and the baggie rule should be dropped			0
current technology allows threat liquids to be detected when they are taken out of the carry - on and scanned in a bin			2
passengers should be chosen randomly for shoes and coat inspections			2
@entity180 programs for frequent fliers that expedite security screening should be applied to all travelers			2
workers need to be retrained in risk management and encouraged to use their own judgment and experience , consulting with team members , to make prudent discretionary security calls			0
the pay - for - performance system for transportation security officers needs to be reinstated			1
when transportation security officers unionized , merit pay was replaced by the seniority system -- essentially , if officers follow the standard operating procedure , they get regular pay raises up till retirement regardless of how well they perform			1
we need to allow real private - sector innovation to compete and play a more meaningful role in security			1
today , a fig leaf system is in place that calls itself " private sector " but is in reality just personnel outsourcing			0
these outsourced employees have to follow the @entity24 process exactly -- the only difference is that they get to charge an 8 % markup on all their expenses			0
we need to get new ideas from outside the @entity24 that can be tested at our checkpoints			0
a clear risk management strategy along with these changes , taken together , would energize checkpoint activity , bring the public more on board , drive out the few bad apples , and improve security			0
see also : how much do we really hate the @entity24 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

@entity223 : @entity2 transportation security officers are *misunderstood*
he says *infractions* are *related* to being *unmotivated* and enforcing *senseless* rules
@entity223 : officers need to be trained , empowered and allowed to think for themselves
he says allow banned items , except obvious ones ; stop shoe inspections , intrusive pat - downs
