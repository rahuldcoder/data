-- when @entity2 drove up @entity3 on the eve of the @entity5 , he was in a confident mood			1
he 'd already won it twice , as well as the @entity8 and @entity9 , but this was to be his " @entity11 " -- the year he cemented his reputation as a global sporting superstar			1
" i was having some of my best times on the golf course , " he told @entity0 , in trademark understated fashion , ahead of this week 's masters			0
" i felt confident about myself and the way i was playing , and it worked out very well			0
" as the first major tournament of the golf year , the masters is a springboard to some of the most magical moments in the sport 's history			0
victory at the prestigious and highly exclusive @entity30 would be a career highlight for most players , but for a select few it is often just one jewel in an era - defining crown			0
@entity2 had been determined to erase memories of the @entity37 , where he double - bogeyed the final hole to hand victory to @entity42 rival @entity41 , the first international golfer to claim the coveted @entity43			1
the following year @entity2 led going into the final round , but needed two late birdies to go into a playoff with @entity47 and @entity41 -- " two of my very best friends in golf			1
" he started badly in the 18 - hole contest on monday but staged a remarkable late surge			0
fifty years on , @entity2 's memories of his eventual triumph are still sharp			1
" i had a pretty good back nine , that was the reason for my victory			0
" for " pretty good " read " stunning " -- @entity2 conjured up birdies at 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 and 16 for a 68 to better player by three shots and don the famous @entity43 for the third time -- he would again wear it in 1964			1
@entity2 's caddy , @entity62 " @entity63 " @entity61 , summed it up perfectly			2
" he just jerks at his glove , tugs at his trouser belt and starts walking fast , " he told reporters after the round			0
" when mr. @entity2 does that , everybody better watch out			2
he 's going to stampede anything in his way			0
" that year @entity2 went on to claim his second @entity75 @entity74 title at @entity76 -- " certainly one of my best opens " -- as he finished 12 under par on the seaside links to win by six from @entity79			1
his only setback came at the @entity74 at @entity83 , in his home state of @entity85 , despite going into the tournament as a heavy favorite			0
an eventual loss in an 18 - hole play off to the 22 - year - old @entity90 was " very disappointing , " said @entity2 -- who three - putted 10 times in five days to undermine his fine play from tee to green			1
but victories in six other @entity96 events , as well as winning the @entity97 ( named after the famous @entity99 golfer @entity98 ) for the @entity8 circuit 's low scoring average , rounded off an incredible year			1
golf 's greatest years by dominating golf as he did that season , @entity2 continued a trend started by @entity98 in the first year of the 20th century -- following in the footsteps of golf legends such as @entity108 and blazing a trail for the likes of @entity90 and @entity111			1
@entity98 , known as " mr. @entity112 , " set the ball rolling			0
born in the @entity75 isle of @entity115 , he left an indelible mark on the game by inventing the @entity118 -- the overlapping of the small finger over the other when holding a club -- which is used by the majority of the top players in the world today			0
in 1900 he crossed the @entity126 and became the first player to win both the @entity74 and the @entity128			2
overall , he captured a record six majors in his homeland			0
in 1920 , at the age of 50 and having suffered from tuberculosis , he still managed second place in the @entity74 -- a true measure of his greatness			0
paving the way for professionals that decade , another golfing superstar emerged in the form of @entity140 , who like @entity2 helped to popularize the sport with his attacking play and flamboyant lifestyle			2
the @entity8 was the first golfer to win $ 1 million in his career , claiming 11 major titles plus five victories at the @entity148 -- which in his era was one of golf 's leading events			2
in 1924 , @entity140 was at the peak of his powers and won the @entity128 as well as the @entity155 ( then a matchplay tournament )			1
he also won three other @entity96 events plus the @entity158			1
while @entity140 helped the acceptance of professional players in a sport that had been mainly amateur , in 1930 another man became a worldwide name despite refusing to accept a cent for his many triumphs			0
father of the masters when the world 's elite play at @entity30 this week , they owe their participation to the foresight and vision of @entity108 , who co-designed the course with @entity175 and co-founded the @entity176 with @entity177			2
competing on an equal footing with @entity140 and the top professionals , @entity108 had already won three @entity8 opens and two @entity75 opens plus four @entity183 crowns			0
but his feats of 1930 will surely remain unmatched			0
he claimed his own grand slam of the two pro and two unpaid majors on both sides of the @entity126 before promptly retiring at the tender age of 28 to practice law at the @entity192 bar			2
@entity193 the @entity194 brought an end to international competition , but that era saw the emergence of one of @entity2 's heroes -- the great @entity199			1
" i watched him and admired him very much			0
he was one of the greatest players of all time , " @entity2 told @entity0 as he recalled the @entity203 's feats			1
@entity199 's greatest year was 1945 , near the end of the war , when he set a record on the @entity96 which will surely remain unbroken			1
the @entity203 won 11 successive tournaments , beating the likes of @entity211 and @entity212			2
his 18 victories out of 35 starts included the pga championship , and his scoring average of 68.33 stood until it was broken by @entity111 in 2000			1
@entity199 retired the following year aged 34 to become a rancher but was the host of a @entity155 event which bore his name until his death in 2006			0
hogan the hero as the @entity8 economy started booming in the post-war years , golf 's profile was further boosted by the exploits of a player who bounced back from life - threatening adversity			0
@entity211 took determination and will to win to new levels in 1953 when he won all three majors he was able to contest , and five of six tournaments overall			1
badly injured in a car crash in 1949 which nearly claimed his life , @entity211 had to limit his schedule to prevent strain on his body			0
@entity239 won the masters by five shots and was six clear in the @entity74 at @entity83 , while he conquered the field at @entity243 in the @entity128 by four strokes to be the only man under par on the tough @entity248 links			1
@entity211 was unable to play in the @entity155 because it overlapped the @entity128 , but he would have chosen not to compete because he was unable to cope with the 36 holes per day expected of the players in the match play format			2
the " @entity90 " a decade after @entity2 's great year , one of his arch - rivals bestrode the game like a giant			1
@entity90 , who had denied @entity2 victory at the @entity258 , was at the peak of his powers			1
" it was easy to see that @entity90 would become a great player , " said @entity2			1
@entity90 won two majors in 1972 , the masters and the @entity74 , and was second to @entity265 at the @entity128			1
seven victories came on the @entity96 and , like @entity2 in ' 62 , he won the money list and the @entity97			1
@entity90 would eventually set an all - time record of 18 majors , the final triumph coming at the masters in 1986 with a famous final - round charge			2
champions duel the " @entity90 " would next be challenged by @entity275 , nine years his junior			0
@entity275 's win in their famous ' " duel in the sun ' " at @entity281 in 1977 will go down in golf history , but five years later his emergence was complete			0
@entity275 denied @entity90 victory again at the @entity285 at @entity286 with a miracle chip from the rough on the short 17th hole			0
the pair were tied for the lead with @entity275 looking certain to drop a shot when his effort hit the flag and went in for the most unlikely of birdies			0
it helped seal a two - shot victory , which the @entity8 followed up by winning his fourth @entity75 @entity74 title at @entity76 before being named the @entity96 's @entity299 for the fifth of six times overall			1
ice - cool @entity99 the balance of power in world golf shifted away from the @entity8 in the 1990s , with @entity99 's @entity304 taking over as the @entity305 as the decade started			0
with an attention to detail and competitive edge modeled on @entity211 , @entity304 claimed the masters for the second time in 1990 after a playoff with @entity312			0
at the home of golf @entity314 , he dominated the @entity128 from the start to win by five shots with a record 18 - under aggregate			2
@entity304 also finished tied for third , one shot back , in the @entity74 at @entity320 and was named golfer of the year on both sides of the @entity126			2
@entity111 on the prowl however , golf had to wait another decade before the astonishing feats of a player who has become one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet , and certainly one of the richest			2
@entity111 could manage only fifth place at the @entity332 at @entity30 , but it was to prove just about his only disappointment in a record - breaking year			1
his 15 - stroke victory in the @entity74 at @entity286 was " the greatest performance in golf history " according @entity336			2
the @entity8 broke @entity304 's @entity128 record with an eight - shot win at @entity314 and made it three majors for the year by beating @entity342 in a playoff at the @entity155			1
woods won nine of 20 @entity96 events that year , with the lowest scoring average in history			1
he then won the 2001 masters to hold all four of golf 's major titles -- the first player to do so in the modern era			0
@entity2 believes the 36 - year - old , who won his invitational tournament at @entity356 last month to end a @entity96 title drought dating back to 2009 , " can return to his best " in 2012			1
the world of golf is waiting to see .			0

50 years since legendary @entity2 claimed his third @entity176 triumph
1962 statistically his greatest year with victory at @entity128 and six other tournaments
every great golfer of the past century has had one year that stood out
@entity111 won three majors in 2000 and nine @entity96 events
