-- @entity1 drew on his vast experience to give a tennis lesson to @entity5 's @entity4 in the deciding singles as the @entity7 retained the @entity8 sunday			1
the 34 - year - old @entity1 kept his composure in front of a partisan crowd in the @entity12 to win 6 - 3 6 - 1 6 - 1 in one hour 52 minutes of largely one sided action			1
. @entity4 , a lowly 117 in the world , could not capitalize on the momentum built by @entity16 , who beat @entity17 in straight sets to level the tie at 2 - 2 ahead of the decider			1
. @entity21 , fresh from his triumph at the @entity23 , was winning his 24th straight match since the @entity25 , but it was all to no avail			0
@entity1 , who had paired with @entity17 to win the crucial doubles for the reigning champions saturday , was stunned in the very first game as he saw @entity4 break his service			1
but he hit back with two breaks of his own to take control and with it the first set			0
three breaks of service in the second set saw him take a stranglehold on the match and the third set followed a similar pattern			0
serving for the coveted team title , he made no mistake and completed victory with a decisive smash			0
by then many of the home crowd had departed , leaving a band of @entity7 supporters to celebrate their repeat success wildly			2
2010 champions @entity5 went into the final deprived of @entity52 , who is injured and @entity53 , serving a controversial doping ban			2
@entity16 sat out the doubles and despite beating @entity17 6 - 4 7 - 6 6 - 2 with another impressive display on indoor courts it was always likely that @entity4 's inexperience would be exploited by the canny @entity1			1
" i do n't think words can describe it			0
it is completely different from the first time			0
to defend this trophy means the world , " @entity1 told the official @entity8 website			1
. " playing in @entity5 on their surface in front of their fans ... we made history today			2
" @entity7 captain @entity73 paid tribute to @entity1 , who was also the hero last year as he beat @entity76 's @entity75 in the deciding singles of the final			1
" @entity1 is a real professional			0
in the final of the fifth rubber , to win 63 61 61 is something amazing			0
