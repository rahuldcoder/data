the @entity0 continues to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly @entity3 train crash while adding to the possibility that human error was involved			1
federal safety investigators have all but eliminated mechanical problems as the cause of the december 1 derailment but added one more clue suggesting the engineer might not have been as attentive as he should have been			1
at 7:11 a.m. that sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train 's headlights as required when it passed another train , the @entity0 said monday			1
engineer @entity16 acknowledged to investigators having a lapse in attention as the train approached a sharp curve , according @entity16 's lawyer , @entity23 , and his union representative			1
the train 's motion might have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed " highway hypnosis			0
" four people died and dozens were injured when the train , traveling at about 82 miles per hour , derailed on the curve , which has a 30 mph limit			1
the @entity0 said monday it believes that positive train control , a high - tech system that targets human error , could have prevented the crash			2

@entity41 is requiring most major railroads , including @entity43 , to install the costly systems by the end of 2015			0
railroad announces safety upgrades the @entity0 said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies			2
the " dead - man " switch -- a foot pedal that must be depressed to keep the train moving -- was also working , the board said			0
nor did it find problems with speed sensors , the brake control unit or the train 's propulsion controller			2
the board reiterated that it found no problems with the tracks or the signal system			0
finally , the board said it conducted a " site / distance " test and found no problems with visibility			0
" as a result , at this time , the @entity0 believes that if positive train control technology was installed on this line and train , it would have required the engineer to slow the train to an appropriate speed or stop the train in the event the engineer did not do so , likely preventing the derailment , " the board said in a statement			1
investigators are still awaiting results of crew drug tests and cellphone records , the board said , and it is continuing interviews with passengers , @entity43 employees who were riding on the train and first responders			2
