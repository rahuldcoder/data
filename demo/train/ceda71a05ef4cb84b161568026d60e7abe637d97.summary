@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government has aired videos showing three men , who claim to be members of the ousted @entity7 , saying they were involved in last month 's devastating @entity0 attacks			1
in recent months the @entity1 government has played a number of such videos for reporters			1
many @entity1 have voiced skepticism about their authenticity			0
in the videos shown sunday , the men said they were @entity7 members who were involved in planning and executing the october 25 bombings at government buildings			1
the two suicide vehicle bombings that struck the @entity20 and other government buildings in october killed 160 @entity1 and wounded more than 500			1
it was @entity1 's deadliest attack in more than two years			0
the attacks mirrored a pair of bombings on august 19 at the @entity27 that killed more than 100 people and wounded hundreds more			0
the @entity29 in @entity1 , an umbrella group that includes @entity31 in @entity1 , claimed responsibility for both the august and october attacks			1
the @entity1 government has said both attacks were a coordinated effort by @entity7 loyalists and @entity31 in @entity1			1
in recent weeks , the government and @entity1 prime minister @entity38 have stepped up the @entity40 rhetoric ahead of the country 's upcoming national elections , an escalation that some fear is a political ploy to keep some @entity47 candidates from running in the elections			1
@entity47 -- a minority in now - @entity50 - led @entity1 -- dominated @entity51 's @entity7 , which ran the country for decades and persecuted majority @entity50 and minority @entity54			1
the party is illegal in @entity1 now , and most of its former mid- and high - level officials are banned from government jobs			2
in an interview with @entity63 on sunday night , which re-aired on monday , government spokesman @entity61 said the attacks originated from people in @entity67			0
@entity68 cautioned that the @entity1 government is not accusing the @entity67 government of involvement			2
he said a group based in @entity67 was planning and carrying out the attacks			0
he said the confessions shown sunday were only a part of the information and confessions the government has			0
after the august bombings , tensions between @entity1 and neighboring @entity67 reached an all - time high and both countries withdrew their ambassadors			2
@entity1 accused @entity67 of harboring @entity7 members who , it said , were financing and planning the attacks in @entity1			1
earlier in august , @entity38 and a high - level delegation visited @entity86 and asked the @entity67 government to hand over a number of mid-level and senior @entity7 living in @entity67			2
@entity67 refused , and the @entity1 accused @entity67 of supporting the august attacks by providing a refuge for @entity7 who were working with @entity31 in @entity1			1
in late august , @entity67 repeated its willingness to help the @entity1 investigate the bombings and discounted the tapes the government had released as fabricated evidence			2
" @entity67 informed the @entity1 side of its readiness to receive an @entity1 delegation to inspect the evidence available to them concerning the bombings ' perpetrators , " a @entity67 official said , according to @entity98 , the state - run news agency			2
" otherwise @entity67 considers what has been broadcast through the @entity1 media as mere fabricated evidence intended to serve internal political goals , and the conflicting and contradicting statements by the @entity1 officials are proof of that			1
" the top @entity116 commander in @entity1 , gen. @entity115 , told reporters last week that investigations into the october bombings were under way and a number of suspects were in custody			1
he said @entity31 in @entity1 has teamed up with remnants of the @entity7 -- a statement that gave more weight to the @entity1 government 's claims			1
" we have been able to significantly reduce the capability of several groups to include @entity31 and some of the @entity47 rejectionist groups , so what i think we have seen happen over the last year or so is that these groups have started to work together			2
and so they have started to coalesce , especially at the local level			0
... so it blurs the lines sometimes			0
and i think sometimes it 's semantics			0
some people say @entity31 , some people call them @entity7			2
i would argue that they are probably both involved , they are coordinating at the local level , " @entity115 said			0
when asked if there was any indication the attacks came from @entity67 , @entity115 said : " i think my experience is that there probably was some movement of fighters or explosives coming in from @entity67			0
but again , we will continue to work our way through that			0
" @entity115 and @entity1 officials have warned that they expect more such high - profile attacks before the january national elections , the country 's second national vote since the @entity116 - led invasion in 2003			1
" we believe there will be attempts to conduct more attacks between now and the elections , because they want to destabilize those			0
we are working hard with @entity1 security force partners to come up with a comprehensive strategy to stop that , we are increasing efforts , the @entity1 are increasing efforts in the belts around @entity0 and @entity174			0
... we are increasing our efforts on the borders and we are increasing our counterterrorism targeting , and the tempo of that has increased significantly over the last month or so , " @entity115 said .			0

@entity1 officials air videos showing alleged confessions by @entity7 members
men in videos say they helped in bombings that killed 160 last month
some say government trying to *discredit* @entity47 so they wo *n't* run for office
@entity116 general says remnants of @entity7 have teamed up with @entity31 in @entity1
