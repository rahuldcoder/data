@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 premier @entity4 's offer to step down as part of a deal to entice the @entity8 into a coalition government with @entity10 rather than @entity12 's conservatives provoked a mixed reaction in the @entity5 press tuesday			1
in a statement outside @entity16 monday , @entity4 announced he would stand down as @entity17 in the autumn and allow a contest for his replacement to begin now			1
" @entity4 at last wielded his great clunking fist yesterday that @entity23 had predicted would halt the @entity25 advance on @entity16 , " declared @entity21			2
" after four days of watching a clumsy courtship between @entity12 and @entity28 , the prime minister timed his announcement to cause maximum trouble			0
" @entity5 parties look to resolve deadlock it added that @entity4 knew his continued occupancy of @entity16 would be an impediment to any hope of @entity10 remaining in power and that " over the weekend , even his closest allies had privately conceded that there was no real prospect of @entity4 remaining the @entity10 leader for long			2
" " squat a mess , " exclaimed @entity43 -- an influential tabloid and stable - mate of the @entity21 in the @entity47 - owned @entity46 empire -- which had switched its allegiance to @entity12 before the election			0
in a scathing attack , it claimed the " squatter pm 's bombshell had plunged the country into deep political chaos -- with no new government now expected for days			0
" the @entity57 , considered the most right - wing of the major @entity5 titles , described @entity4 's offer to quit as " a squalid day for democracy , " and added that many of @entity10 's old guard openly condemned the prospect of a " shabby deal with the @entity8 that would deny the keys of @entity16 to @entity12			1
" " i believe it will lead to a lack of legitimacy , and i think the @entity5 people will feel that we have not heard what they said to us , " former home secretary @entity67 was quoted as saying			0

the @entity84 labeled @entity4 's plan " a very @entity10 coup " that had outflanked @entity12 as he prepared to enter @entity87			1
it said @entity10 was attempting to " exploit the @entity90 ' reluctance to offer the @entity8 far - reaching voting reform			2
" @entity10 offered to hold a referendum asking voters if they want a proportional representation voting system -- a key issue for the @entity8			0
the left - leaning @entity96 said @entity4 's " last card " had panicked the conservatives into making an " extraordinary " counter-offer to the @entity8 : a referendum on the alternative vote electoral system and a coalition government with seats for @entity28 's party in the cabinet			1
this " hurried @entity25 offer , previously seen as completely beyond the ideological pale for the party , was swallowed by shell - shocked @entity110 , " it said			0
" for the greater @entity120 , " was the effusive response from the @entity10 - supporting @entity112 , as it painted a selfless picture of a prime minister who had " fallen on his sword " for the good of the country .			0
