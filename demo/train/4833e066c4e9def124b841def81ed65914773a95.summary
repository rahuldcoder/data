@entity0 -- tension in the stadium was at fever pitch , with the world record holder @entity6 gesturing for quiet from the partisan home crowd as two more star performers in the field settled into the blocks for what was billed as a grudge match			2
at stake was a @entity15 100m gold medal featuring rival runners who had been involved in a spat in an earlier race			2
but it was also the moment i realized for the first time that i was watching the contest not through the prism of disability but as a genuinely exciting sporting event that had me riveted to the edge of my seat			0
it was the first of two revelations of the night			0
as a sports fan and @entity32 i gobbled up hours of breathtaking competition from the @entity34 but i confess i had mixed views on the @entity36 before the event started			0
great for the competitors , great for the home crowd who could be confident of a high medal count , great for the profile of disabled sport -- but would we really be watching a fair contest ? for the most part , that reservation has been blown away by a week of heart - warming stories of courage and determination , and of blistering , thrilling athletics , cycling , swimming and a host of other sports i have not explored before			1
take blind football for example			0
it is an astonishing mixture of traditional football and a ballet in fast - forward			1
players sprint across the pitch , skilfully tapping the football from foot to foot , while defenders follow the game by sound , listening for the bell inside the ball			0
you can only wonder at their close control and spatial awareness			0
it 's thrilling stuff and such was their mastery that if you did n't know better , you would swear the players could see			1
then there 's the passion and aggression of wheelchair rugby , or " @entity83 " as it has been coined			0
it 's fast , it 's furious , and full - on			1
never mind that they are in wheelchairs -- the hits are real			0
the same agility is evident in the wheelchair basketball where the athletes can turn their chairs on a dime			2
on thursday night , @entity95 and @entity96 sprint star @entity94 -- " @entity94 " as he is known -- was pipped for third place in that eagerly - anticipated 100m sprint by his @entity100 team mate @entity99			2
local boy @entity6 duly delivered joy for the home crowd by winning gold , and @entity105 @entity104 took silver			1
it was an explosive race that made a change to the medal table ... and my second pause for reflection			0
where on earth was the @entity105 in all this ? given the size of the @entity118 , we have no business occupying third slot in the @entity36 medal table			1
@entity122 ran well in the 100m but the @entity105 languished in sixth place despite the team being the third largest represented at the @entity36			1
the @entity1 website has given prominent coverage to the @entity15 but @entity105 host broadcaster @entity128 decided to show only four hour - long highlight programs on its sport channel			1
it 's a decision that has drawn criticism from former paralympian and chef de mission of the @entity125 , @entity136			0
" that disconnect between the @entity105 being a world leader in disability issues and the broadcast coverage in real time of the @entity36 is disappointing , " she said in the @entity118 newspaper , @entity138			1
the lack of coverage is a terrible shame because @entity105 citizens have missed out on the fantastic endeavours of their athletes and could potentially hold back the future aspirations of many more			1
@entity105 athlete @entity151 has won a heap of @entity96 medals since 2004			1
but as her own website puts it : " she probably should not be alive			0
" she was born with spina bifida , resulting in paralysis below the waist , and spent the first six years of her life using her hands as if they were feet because she did n't have a wheelchair			0
she was rescued from a @entity164 orphanage in 1994 by @entity165 -- then commissioner of @entity167 for the @entity105 @entity151 has overcome abandonment , disability and illness to become a world beating athletic star			1
eight - time world champion @entity173 represents the @entity105 in the swimming pool and described to @entity1 the commitment needed to win @entity96 gold			1
it would be a tragedy if people like @entity151 and @entity173 were denied a chance to shine on an international stage			0
the @entity118 has been creating opportunities for disabled athletes since the end of @entity185 , and it shows on the medal table			2
but many nations were only able to send one or two athletes to @entity0			2
i hope the interest and enthusiasm demonstrated by the sell - out crowds at @entity96 events will be matched by other countries because the fun attached to inspiring , entertaining sport has been a welcome tonic to the economic gloom			1
there may still be questions over whether there is a level playing field in all sports in the @entity36 but the exposure and debate can only improve the way the events are organized			1
perhaps the real inequality is in the sporting chance that nations give to those who wish to confront their disabilities , excel in sports they have made their own and compete in the kind of activities that the able - bodied take for granted			2
perhaps too they deserve better media coverage at home			0
for my part , i just ca n't wait for the @entity221			0
i hope you get to watch them too .			0

paralympics showed stories of courage and thrilling athleticism , writes @entity229
@entity229 asks : where on earth was the @entity105 in all this ?
@entity105 citizens have missed fantastic endeavours of their athletes , he says
exposure and debate can only improve way events are organized - @entity229
