we asked him how to decorate the walls without robbing a bank			0
@entity0 : how did you develop your art expertise ? @entity1 : after business school , i became intrigued by the art world and ended up at a training program at @entity14 , where i was later hired as a contemporary - art specialist			1
then i helped found the @entity16 , in @entity17 , which is now the @entity18			0
@entity0 : you 're also a designer			0
@entity0 : easy paint makeovers @entity1 : yes			1
i was curating art for a client when he asked me to decorate his home			1
that led to work for the home - design magazine @entity27			2
now i 'm the creative director of the shopping site @entity29			0
real @entity30 : can you tell us why art is so tricky ? @entity1 : because it 's truly about personal taste			1
it 's more art than science			1
@entity0 : what if you do n't know what your taste is ? @entity1 : you can figure it out			1
gather images of rooms you 're drawn to and take a look at the kind of art in them			2
maybe it 's all watercolors — or black - and - white photos			2
@entity0 : then what ? @entity1 : think about your space			1
there should n't be a disconnect between the decor and the art. if you have a glamorous room , for example , you do n't want flea - market art in beat - up frames			1
it would be better to go with something more polished , with a gold or silver frame			0
@entity0 : fill in the blank : types of art that tend to look good at all price points include _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _			2
@entity72 : black - and - white photography , graphic posters , small drawings , and sketches			0
nice , large figurative paintings are hard to find at a low price , so maybe steer clear of those			0
@entity0 : transform a corner of your home @entity0 : what sites do you like for affordable art ? @entity1 : @entity85 has some fantastic modern - art prints , and @entity87 is great for fine - art prints			1
@entity29 has nice reproductions of iconic art from @entity91 and mixed - media work from artists like @entity94			1
@entity0 : what 's the difference between posters and prints ? @entity1 : posters are reproductions that are unlimited in number ; prints are often limited editions signed and numbered by the artist			1
@entity0 : how do you make posters look their absolute best ? @entity1 : some have text on the bottom			1
if you cut that off before framing , they can look so much better			2
@entity0 : 12 quick fixes for your household things @entity0 : any rules of thumb on framing ? @entity1 : affordable art should have affordable frames			1
affordable ornate frames are usually not good , so i would stick with simple , thin black or white frames			0
what you want to avoid is taking your $ 60 poster to a frame shop for a $ 300 frame			0
@entity0 : but does n't framing cost a fortune no matter what ? @entity0 : 11 bedroom makeovers @entity1 : check out wholesaleposterframes.com			1
you give them the size of your art , and they send you a frame that you put together			1
it 's easy — i 've done it			2
it looks almost like a custom frame			0
@entity0 : say that you want to fill the space above a sofa and you have a budget of $ 200			0
@entity1 : i would bring a family photo that does n't look staged — something candid or abstract — to @entity143 and have it blown up to about 30 by 40 inches , then frame it			1
@entity146 and white feels more artsy , so that 's one way to make it cooler			2
@entity0 : what if you have $ 500 ? @entity1 : get three works by the same artist , frame them the same way , and hang them in a row			1
@entity0 : 14 living - room and dining - room makeovers @entity0 : how about a bigger budget , like $ 2,000 ? @entity1 : look at local galleries			1
prints and photos tend to be the least expensive options			2
most places let you take things on approval			0
you may have to pay , but you can get a refund if the piece does n't work			0
@entity0 : how do you put together a wall of art ? @entity1 : there should be some commonality , like a consistent color palette or size			1
if there is n't , frame all the art the same so that the look is unified			2
on the wall in my home office , i have reproductions of @entity183 's love and @entity185 's @entity184 1963			1
it 's charming to add a postcard , a calendar , or even kid art. some of my favorite works are by four - year - old friends			0
@entity0 : any secret sources that we might not think of ? @entity0 : 21 ways to enhance an entryway @entity1 : museum shops			2
if you go to an exhibition and love it , see if there 's a cool object or poster			0
sometimes they 're hokey , so do n't pick the most iconic thing , like a reproduction of @entity206			0
go for something less obvious , less recognizable			0
@entity0 : some people recommend shopping student shows at art schools			0
any advice on this ? @entity1 : i would focus on pieces that are conceptual or abstract — big swashes of paint or something really geometric — because students are just starting to develop their technical skills			2
@entity0 : bottom - line it for us			0
@entity1 : art should make you happy			1
sometimes people buy things to impress others , but you damn well better like the pieces on your wall when you come home			0
good art collectors know to shop from the heart , and that applies at any price			0

art can be tricky because it 's really about personal taste , buyer @entity1 said .
framing does n't have to cost a fortune -- do it yourself options give you control
reproductions look at home in the *company* of *similarly* colored or sized pictures
