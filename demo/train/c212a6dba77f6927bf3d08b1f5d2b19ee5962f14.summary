-- @entity1 did not seem born for a life on the high seas			1
one of the greatest female sailors on the planet clearly did not take after her mother @entity6 , whose fear of water is so strong she will not even take a shower			1
so when @entity1 announced she was quitting her job as a school teacher to pursue a career sailing some of the roughest oceans on the globe , unsurprisingly it sent shock waves through her mother			1
" it 's a bit beyond her as she 's scared stiff of water , to the extent she wo n't shower as she does n't like the sensation of water running over her , " says @entity1 of her mother			1
" she has an understanding of what i do but , in genetics terms , i clearly have taken after my father			1
" last week , @entity1 set out from @entity32 with a course for @entity34 and the 6,125 nautical miles in between as part of the all - female @entity36 on what will be her fifth yachting voyage around the world , this time in the @entity40			1
@entity1 is the first woman to have sailed single - handed , non-stop around the world in both directions			1
" i never dreamt this would happen , i never dreamt i 'd once sail around the world , " admits @entity1 , who was teaching physical education to 11 to 18 - year - olds and loved the job , meaning she had no great urgency to leave			1
her first voyages on water were on a boat on the @entity52 with her father , @entity53 who , in many ways , was the inspiration for her change of career -- the 41 - year - old quit her job not long after his death 15 years ago			1
" it 's strange because i loved my job and had a lot of fun but i had a craving as an adventurer and to travel , " says @entity1 of her job teaching from a classroom on @entity65 's south coast where she regularly saw sailing boast pass by in the distance			1
water sports were the immediate calling -- first windsurfing and then scuba diving before she finally settled on her sport of choice , sailing , which she had , at least , done at university as part of her degree			1
" i remember thinking ' this is something i could do ' , " she recalls			0
" i told my mum i was going to take a break from teaching to go sailing and you should have seen her face			1
it was a picture -- her face just fell			0
i tried to reassure her by telling her i could go back to it if things did n't work out but thankfully they did			0
" now the only time i go back to school is to give talks , to hopefully inspire people and give them the confidence to dream			0
" as for @entity84 , her outlook has considerably shifted to one of pride , although still laced with a modicum of bemusement due to her own discomfort in water			1
for @entity1 , leg 2 of the @entity40 will be her first of the race			1
the last of the 14 - strong team to sign a contract in march , she sat out the opening leg , with only 12 competitors allowed on board to race at any one time			1
it is perhaps befitting for this latecomer to professional sailing to be a latecomer to this latest venture			2
she expects to add a fresh gusto to her teammates and is very clear what her role will be on board , one she hopes to keep right until the race finish next year			2
" i think i 'm the @entity84 of the group , a combination of experience with this being my fifth time around the world but also the fact i 'm the oldest in the group , " she says			2
" i 'm hopefully the level - headed one so they can look to me for confidence , particularly as for many this will be their first time in the @entity138			2
" it 's shell shock when you first go down there , it 's the race 's first big weather system and you realize how big the waves are and how cold it can be			2
but this is what i signed up for , this is the good stuff , when it 's blowing 40 knots and icy -- that 's fabulous			2
" despite her positive outlook , like many other competitors in the race she too has her fears , in particular one of heights and another of fish , both of which she has to tackle head - on			2
she recalls her time in the 2005 @entity162 race when she was stuck up the mast of her boat for three hours being flung around like a rag doll or having to squeamishly scoop up flying fish that have landed aboard her vessel during the @entity169			0
but she has a remarkable aptitude for dealing with the harsh nature of the ocean from just 50 minutes sleep at a time during the @entity169 to being pumped up on painkillers after suffering a badly swollen knee but having to plough on in the race			0
plus there is the issue of solitude -- at one point during her solo circumnavigation , the closest human beings to her were the astronauts on the @entity184			0
on this journey , @entity36 currently lie in fourth place overall , defying critics who argued that an all - female team could not match their male counterparts in such a rigorous race			1
" the sport itself is still pretty male dominated , " she explains , " but i think it 's beginning to change that it does n't matter whether you 're male or female			1
we 're all in the same boat doing the same stuff in the same conditions			0
hopefully we 're breaking down the stereotypes and i believe our peers see us as proper competitors			0
" we used to be called the girls but that 's changed , now we 're all referred to as @entity36			2
i like that , it shows we 're being taken seriously			0
" this race is one of the few big outings left on @entity1 's to - do list			1
it also doubles up as another chance to feed her wanderlust and travel the globe again			2
" you could say that round - the - world sailing is a drug , " she says			1
" when you 're not on the water , you 're pining to be back there			0
it 's just no two days are ever the same			0
it 's a fabulous place to be			0
the day i stop enjoying it is the day i stop			0
" on the eve of the competition starting for her , the great granddaughter of a @entity226 sea captain -- the only family maritime history she knows of -- she talked excitedly about getting out there , chomping at the bit to get going			0
she is well - versed to the potential dangers but argues that " the more miles you do , the more confident you are			0
" she is relishing the intensity and camaraderie of the team , a far cry from her solo venture			0
she wants to bring fresh arms , fresh legs and a fresh mind to @entity36			0
in her case , mum 's the word			0
