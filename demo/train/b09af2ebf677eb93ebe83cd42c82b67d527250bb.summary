-- @entity1 fought and died so blacks would no longer be viewed as inferior but rather enjoy the same inherent rights given to whites in @entity5			0
yet in 2014 , 50 years since the passage of the @entity8 , the @entity6 thinks it 's appropriate to publish a story about our first black president , @entity11 , with the headline , " @entity14 in the @entity15			1
" oh , the times we are living in			0
all i could do was feel sick to my stomach when i read the headline that the monthly newspaper serving @entity22 's @entity21 published			1
and it brought up the pain my family went through nearly four decades ago			2
not only is the word reprehensible but also why would an editor of a newspaper use the n - word in a headline about @entity5 's first black president ? as a black woman who is a dogged critic of @entity11 's policies and his presidency and also happens to be the daughter of parents who grew up in the segregated @entity37 and were called that word , i find the headline disgusting and reprehensible to say about the nation 's first black president , even if the author claimed he was actually writing in support of the president			1
the article , written by an 86 - year - old white man , @entity45 , supports @entity11 , noting , " far right voters hate @entity11 because he is black			1
" " that was the whole point in this , that a great many people in the @entity5 continue to think of president @entity11 as the n * * * * r , and i wanted to make that point , that there 's a substantial amount of racism still existing in the @entity5 , " @entity45 told @entity0 's @entity48 on monday			1
i guess @entity45 could be a liberal but in his heart still feels it is ok to use that word to describe @entity11			1
clearly , no political party owns racism and that 's just the problem			2
for the record , i do n't think it 's ok for blacks to call each other the word either or for so - called black hip - hop artists to lace their music with the word like they 're saying the " hello			1
" still , despite all the major achievements of blacks before and since the @entity73 , most notably the attaining the highest office in the land , many whites in this country have a deep - seated hatred toward blacks and will never view us as equal			1
they even think they are complimenting us when they call us that word			2
and at the end of the day , that 's all we 're considered , no matter what we do or accomplish			2
in a pathetic attempt to defend using the headline , the @entity6 ' editor , @entity85 , told the @entity86 : " in this article , however , @entity87 reminded me that the @entity89 avoids using the word which convinced me that @entity91 should			1
" @entity92 defends his decision as wanting to be provocative and " out do " the @entity89			1
i think it 's more plain that			0
it seems the only way @entity85 thought to praise a black president was to use a racist word to disparage him			1
the entire incident shows how far @entity5 has to yet to go in race relations			0
remember , this is 2014			0
that 's when i was just a child and my parents had to sue the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , suburb of @entity109 , @entity108 , for denying them membership a private club in our neighborhood only because we were black			2
it was then i learned about racism , specifically , that no matter what , some white people just hate black people for no other reason than the color of their skin			0
my father ( dr. @entity123 , an accomplished dentist ) and mother ( @entity124 ) had moved into their dream home they had spent a year building and applied for membership to the club their kids could ride their bikes to and learn how to swim and play tennis			1
but in the summer of 1977 , the club 's all - white board of directors voted to reject my parents ' membership application			1
the all - white board also rejected the family of @entity142 all - pro star @entity141			1
the club had no black members and no white applicant had ever been denied membership to the club			2
part of the reason my parents built a home in @entity151 was because the real estate developers of the subdivision advertised homeowners could enjoy club membership			0
they just failed to mention it was a perk available to " white - only homeowners			2
" after my parents got rejected , one of the co-developers , @entity159 , sent a letter to the @entity106 board of directors congratulating them on a job well - done and told them to " continue to act in the same responsible way , " according to june 5 , 1980 , @entity170 article " @entity168			0
" like the author in the @entity6 , @entity171 did n't use the n - word to refer to my parents in the body of his letter			1
but he may as well have because that 's how he viewed them			0
after a lower court ruled against my parents , they appealed to the @entity181 , which unanimously ruled on september 30 , 1980 , my parents had been discriminated against			0
my parents never joined the club			0
it was n't about the membership			0
it was about respect and teaching their three children about doing what was right and " responsible			0
" just before the ruling was handed down , my father was quoted saying : " you ca n't believe it 's 1980 , and they 're still doing this thing			0
" sadly , it 's 2014 and @entity198 , they 're still doing the same thing , only this time to the @entity200			0
join us on @entity203 / @entity202 .			0

@entity205 says the use of the n - word to describe the president was reprehensible
an 86 year - old writer used the term in a recent headline in a @entity89 newspaper
in 1977 , @entity123 's family was refused *admission* into an all - white country club
