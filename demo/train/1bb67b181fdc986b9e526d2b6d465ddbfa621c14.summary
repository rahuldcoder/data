@entity0 -- solicitor general @entity2 was easily confirmed thursday as the next associate justice of the @entity4 , completing the 50 - year - old native @entity6 's climb to the peak of the @entity9 legal profession			1
the 63 - 37 vote was mostly along party lines			0
five @entity13 senators backed @entity2 , and only one @entity14 -- sen. @entity15 of @entity16 -- opposed her			1
@entity13 leaders offered spirited floor opposition to the nominee , but were unable to muster a prolonged delay or filibuster of the vote			2
@entity2 is set to begin a lifetime position as the nation 's 112th justice			1
she will be sworn into office saturday afternoon , taking the traditional constitutional and judicial oaths			0
the newest justice will then be able to assume her court duties immediately			2
her brisk confirmation was a political victory for president @entity32 -- who placed justice @entity34 on the high court last year -- and for @entity36			1
@entity32 after the vote predicted @entity2 will be an " outstanding @entity4 justice , " and thanked senators for giving his nominee a fair and timely hearing			1
" they got a sense of her formidable intelligence , her rich understanding of our @entity46 , her commitment to the rule of law , and her excellent and occasionally irreverent sense of humor , " said the president			0
" and they have come to understand why , throughout her career , she has earned the respect and admiration of folks from across the political spectrum , an achievement reflected in today 's bipartisan vote			2
" @entity2 was the administration 's solicitor general when @entity32 nominated her on may 10 to replace retired justice @entity63			1
she will become the current court 's youngest member and third woman			2
@entity68 and @entity69 sources said @entity2 watched the confirmation vote on television at the @entity69 , with colleagues in the solicitor general 's office			1
during the final day of floor debate , republicans continued to raise deep concerns over what they contended was @entity2 's lack of judicial experience , her views on gun rights , and her past work inside the @entity83			1
they said that she will become a judicial " activist " intent on twisting the law to fit her personal political agenda			1
" throughout ms. @entity2 's career she has put her politics above the law , " said @entity89 sen. @entity88 , the top @entity13 on the @entity90 and leader of opposition to @entity2			1
" the @entity9 people will not easily forgive this @entity36 if we confirm ms. @entity2 to the @entity4			1
they will not easily forgive the @entity36 if we further expose our @entity46 to revision and rewrite by judicial fiat			1
" among other things , @entity13 have repeatedly slammed @entity2 's handling of military recruiters seeking access to the @entity106 campus earlier this decade , when @entity2 served as dean			1
@entity2 has said she staunchly opposes the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military			2
one last - minute " no " vote came from @entity115 sen. @entity114 , the chamber 's newest @entity13			2
" i believe nominees to the @entity4 should have previously served on the bench , " said @entity114 , generally considered to be a key moderate			2
" lacking that , i look for many years of practical courtroom experience to compensate for the absence of prior judicial experience			1
in @entity2 's case , she is missing both			1
" the best umpires , " he said , referencing to a popular line from chief justice @entity129 ' confirmation hearings , " must not only call balls and strikes , but also have spent enough time on the playing field to know the strike zone			0
" @entity114 , who replaced the late @entity136 sen. @entity135 in february , had earlier effusively praised @entity2 , and personally introduced her at the start of her confirmation hearings in june			1
@entity2 lived in @entity115 for several years before becoming solicitor general			2
democrats argued that @entity2 possesses the intelligence and professional background necessary to be a force on the high court			2
they said they hope she will help counter what many on the left contend are excessively conservative court rulings that defy the will of @entity152 while hurting individual workers and voters			0
when confirmed , " average @entity9 will be a step closer to once again having their voices heard in the highest court in the land , " said sen. @entity155 , @entity156 - @entity6			0
" @entity2 is a role model for so many women entering the legal profession today , " said sen. @entity161 , @entity162			0
" her intellect , other broad range of legal experience , her sense of fairness ( and ) her profound respect for the law make her well - qualified to serve as an associate justice of the court			1
" conservative opposition to @entity2 failed to resonate this election year , a stark contrast to the heated @entity4 confirmation battles of @entity129 and @entity178 in 2005			1
television and radio ads from advocacy groups were few , and serious grassroots outrage never materialized			0
administration officials painted @entity2 as a moderate liberal , and many legal analysts seemed to agree she was a politically safe pick for @entity32			0
" the president probably got exactly what he wanted , and that 's not someone who makes either the far right or the far left terribly happy			0
she seems to be a centrist , pragmatic progressive -- someone who 's on the left but not the extreme left , " said @entity191 , a top @entity0 lawyer and founder of the web site scotusblog.com			0
" she 's a nominee without much of a track record , and therefore not much to attack			0
and the air really went entirely out of the balloon when trying to draw attention to her , maybe paint her as a liberal , or create her as an issue for the upcoming elections in november			0
" @entity2 was born in @entity205 in 1960 , one of three children of a lawyer father and schoolteacher mother			0
she graduated from @entity106 and served in a prestigious @entity4 clerkship with the @entity211			0
while never a judge herself , @entity2 's resume is diverse : work on @entity217 ' 1988 presidential campaign ; a lawyer in private practice for two years ; stints as a law professor and later , dean ; four years as a legal and policy adviser in the @entity83 ; and most recently as solicitor general in the @entity224			1
she supervised every federal appeal presented to the high court during her tenure at the @entity69 , and personally argued six cases before the same justices she will now count as colleagues			0
@entity2 will join a closely divided court that often splits in favor of a shaky 5 - 4 conservative majority			2
despite no judicial record to draw clues on the kind of justice she would become , @entity68 officials had quietly assured allies @entity2 would be a " reliable " liberal vote similar to @entity63 , the well - respected unofficial leader of the left - leaning bloc on the court			1
she is , therefore , not expected to tilt the current ideological balance on the high court			0
among the cases she will confront in her first term beginning in october will be disputes over protests at military funerals , state bans on violent video games , and the death penalty			0
high - profile appeals that may reach the court in the next couple of years include @entity257 's sweeping immigration reform law and @entity162 's ban on same - sex marriage			0
@entity1 's @entity260 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 is confirmed as the 112th @entity4 justice
five @entity36 @entity13 backed @entity2 ; one @entity14 opposed her
@entity13 have called *kagan* a political activist with little judicial experience
@entity36 have praised @entity2 's intellect and said she may help balance the court
