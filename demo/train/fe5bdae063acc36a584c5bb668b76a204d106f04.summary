@entity1 the idea of a video phone has been around for decades			1
while there have been a handful of real video phones , they were never widely available for the average @entity8			1
then , a company with a strange name harnessed the power of the internet and the ever - growing ubiquity of webcams to bring that dream to the masses			1
but what does the name @entity1 have to do with talking to other people online ? @entity1 is a peer - to - peer communication technology , meaning one person connects to another person , via the @entity1 service			1
of course to the average person , the connection is happening in a mysterious , ethereal realm			2
so when they were developing the name , they hit upon the rather descriptive " @entity31 peer - to - peer , " which was shortened to " @entity33			2
" however , when they went to register the web address for their new product , skyper.com and the other			2
something variations were already taken			2
so , they decided to try dropping the " r " and , sure enough , skype.com was available			2
in hindsight , it worked out for the best -- saying you 're " @entity46 " with your friend sounds a bit clumsy			2
@entity0 : low - tech crooks thwarted by high - tech gadgets 2			2
@entity51 founded in 2005 , the online marketplace @entity51 has amassed over seven million registered users and saw revenues of just over $ 300 million in 2010			1
and while the name is catchy , many have often asked what it means			2
for a while , the company was pretty tight - lipped about the origin , leaving users to come up with their own acronyms or explanations			2
however , in a january 2010 interview for @entity66 , founder @entity64 finally revealed the secret : " i wanted a nonsense word because i wanted to build the brand from scratch			1
i was watching @entity71 's 8 ½and writing down what i was hearing			1
in @entity74 , you say ' etsi ' a lot			2
it means ' oh , yes			2
' and in @entity78 , it means ' and if			2
@entity79 for a while , it was widely believed that , in 1995 , then - 28 - year old software developer @entity82 created a website called @entity79 so his fiancée could buy and sell @entity86 dispensers			1
while the @entity86 part is n't true -- @entity82 was simply looking for a way to make something cool online -- it does make for a good story			0
what 's not legend , though , is that the first item sold on @entity79 was anything but glamorous -- a broken laser pointer			1
@entity82 only intended the laser pointer listing to be a test , but was surprised to find that someone actually bought it -- according to reports , the buyer collected broken laser pointers			1
thinking he might be on to something , @entity82 started working in earnest on the program			0
while contemplating names for the site , he initially planned to use the name of his computer consulting company , @entity110			1
however , echobay was already taken ( and still is )			0
so @entity82 shortened the name to " ebay " and bought the web address that we all know and love			1

@entity120 when @entity122 was developing the name for their new search engine , they wanted something that was a single syllable , memorable , and easy to spell			1
of course once they got into the naming process , there were other things to consider as well			0
for example , one idea -- " bang " -- was rejected because you could n't make a verb out of it without sounding , well , inappropriate			0
( " what other movies has @entity136 been in ? " " i do n't know			0
bang her and find out ! " ) so the marketers decided to put their money on " @entity120			0
" not only was it a single syllable , easy to spell , and easy to remember , it also sounded like " bingo , " which is usually said when you 've found what you 're looking for			0
the name also reminded people of the moment an idea is hatched , sort of like when that little light bulb goes off over a cartoon character 's head			1
you hear a " @entity120 , " which is what @entity122 hopes will happen when you use their website			0
@entity154 one of the fastest - growing websites around , @entity154 was started in 2004 by then - college students @entity156 and @entity158			0
the site allows community members to submit links to online content , which is then voted up or down to decide which submissions are most worthy of being read by everyone else			0
the name @entity154 is little more than a play on the phrase " read it , " as in , " i read it online			0
" but , as one member of the site ( also known as a " redditor " ) pointed out , there is a @entity78 parallel to the site 's name that turned out to be a pretty cool coincidence			1
one loose translation of " reddit " is " render , " which can mean " to submit for consideration or approval , " which is exactly what people do on the site			0
@entity184 @entity185 and its ilk might be the talk of the town right now , but for the true innovator in the online " @entity191 " game , look no further than @entity184			0
since 2004 , @entity184 has offered a new item every night at midnight to devoted fans , known as @entity194 , who obsessively check @entity184 's sites to buy everything from computers to flashlights to a " @entity199 " ( @entity200 ) -- a coveted , mystery grab bag that is often sold out within minutes of its unveiling			1
if you 're at all familiar with internet culture , you 'll know that " woot " is also an expression of excitement , sometimes spelled " w00t			1
" according to @entity184 , founder / ceo of @entity184 , that is where the company got its name , but it goes a bit deeper than that			1
" the company @entity184 was designed from the ground up to fit that name and adapt itself as a public ' employee store ' type of liquidation retailer , " @entity217 said			0
" what type of store would you load up and say " w00t ! " to ? answer ... that would be what we built and strive every day to reach			0
" so @entity184 is named after " w00t , " but where does " w00t " come from ? that 's actually a bit of a mystery			1
some believe it first appeared in the mid- 90s , adopted from the songs " @entity237 ! ) " and " @entity238 ! there it is ! " others define it as the acronym , " we owned the @entity243 , " originating as a victory cry for online gamers			0
still others say it comes from an old hacker term used whenever someone has gained full , or " root , " access to a server , exclaiming " w00t ! i have root ! " and one more theory traces woot back to the game @entity259			0
whatever the origin , there are a few idistinctions between " w00t ! " and " @entity184			0
" the company name does not have the zeros replacing the @entity266 , and the exclamation point is only used in the logo or when there is genuine cause for excitement			0
@entity0 : what 's a @entity273 ? 8 more tech names explained 7			1
the @entity275 what does a ferocious - sounding animal have to do with the news ? the @entity275 is the name of a newspaper in @entity282 's 1938 novel " scoop " , the favorite book of the website 's founder and editor - in - chief , @entity287			1
scoop , a biting satire of journalism , tells the story of a young writer sent to @entity293 as a foreign correspondent after he is mistaken for a similarly named , well - respected novelist			1
while there , a civil war breaks out and the naïve reporter accidentally does a great job covering the conflict			0
