@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 , the @entity3 presidential candidate in 2008 , took aim sunday at the field of contenders for the 2012 @entity3 nomination , accusing them of " isolationism			1
" " we can not repeat the lessons of the 1930s , when the @entity16 stood by while bad things happened in the world , " @entity2 said in an interview with @entity12 's " @entity11			1
" citing what he viewed as the @entity3 presidential hopefuls ' positions in general on both @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity2 said , " we are the lead nation in the world , and @entity16 matters , and we must lead			1
but sometimes that leadership entails sacrifice , sadly			0
" asked about a threat by @entity30 speaker @entity29 to consider cutting funding for @entity16 involvement in the @entity34 - led military mission , @entity2 , @entity35 , responded , " i was more concerned about what the candidates in @entity41 the other night said , " referring to a @entity1 debate among seven people seeking the @entity3 presidential nomination			1
" this is isolationism , " @entity2 said			2
" there 's always been an isolationist strain in the @entity3 , the @entity47 wing of our party			2
but now it seems to have moved more center stage , so to speak			0
" if former president @entity53 had watched the debate , @entity2 said , he " would be saying that 's not the @entity3 of the 20th century and now the 21st century			1
that is not the @entity3 that has been willing to stand up for freedom " for people all over the world			2
a bipartisan group of 10 lawmakers has filed suit against the @entity63 administration , alleging that continuing the @entity16 military involvement in @entity22 without @entity66 approval violates the @entity67			2
the @entity63 administration denies any violation			0
@entity2 said every president has disagreed with the constitutionality of the @entity67 , " but they have adhered to it			2
" " so the @entity66 should pass a resolution -- and senator @entity74 ( @entity75 ) and i have the resolution that 's ready to go -- that would comply with the @entity67 , " @entity2 said			0
@entity22 leader @entity77 " was at the gates of @entity79 , " @entity2 said			1
" he said he was going to go house to house to kill everybody			0
that 's a city of 700,000 people			0
what would we be saying now if we had allowed for that to happen ? " citing the 1988 bombing of @entity89 and a 1986 @entity22 sponsored bombing of a @entity92 disco frequented by @entity16 soldiers , @entity2 said @entity77 has @entity16 ' blood " on his hands			1
" " if @entity77 remains in power , it 's clear that you will see him engage in an escalated effort , of course , to harm the @entity16 , obviously , " he said			1
@entity2 was equally adamant that the @entity16 mission in @entity23 must continue			1
" we abandoned @entity23 once , and we paid a very heavy price for it in the attacks of 9/11 , " he said			0
" so that is an important lesson that we must learn			0
" in the @entity1 debate , former @entity75 gov. @entity106 , currently leading the pack of @entity3 hopefuls in polls , said " it 's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can , consistent with the word that comes from our generals that we can hand the country over			0
" @entity2 took issue with that			0
" i wish that candidate @entity106 and all the others would sit down " with general @entity119 , commander of the war in @entity23 , " and understand how this counterinsurgency is working and succeeding , " @entity2 said .			1
