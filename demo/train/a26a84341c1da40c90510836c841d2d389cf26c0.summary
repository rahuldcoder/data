-- as @entity2 demonstrates its staying power , media increasingly portray it favorably			1
because of its success , the movement is being asked to put forth a list of its demands			1
so far , members have said no. and well they should			0
the refusal of @entity2 to tie itself down with an agenda that can be debated piecemeal is one of its great strengths			1
the decision allows @entity2 to remain a @entity15 for all who believe they have lost ground over the last decade			1
in choosing this strategy , @entity2 is doing more than defying expectations			1
it is linking itself with the best of 1960s @entity21			0
fifty years ago in his 1961 @entity23 , president @entity22 declared that the torch had been passed to a new generation of @entity21			0
a year later , in its @entity27 of 1962 , the group @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , took @entity22 's generational declaration a step further , insisting that the time had come for @entity21 to make a new commitment to social justice			1
for @entity26 , an organization dominated by college and graduate students , participatory democracy was a version of @entity2 's horizontal democracy , and to look back at @entity26 's @entity27 is to see why @entity2 activists should feel confident about the path they have chosen			1
the @entity27 was often maddeningly vague			2
but like @entity2 's chant , " we are the 99 percent , " the @entity27 left no doubt about the all - inclusive equality @entity26 sought			1
as @entity44 has written in his definitive history " sds : the @entity49 , " the organization both captured and shaped the spirit of the new student mood			0
" @entity21 rests in national stalemate " was the underlying premise of the @entity27			2
@entity26 believed the " decline of utopia and hope " was the defining feature of the @entity21 political landscape in the early ' 60s , and its task was to search for " truly democratic alternatives			2
" @entity26 members had , they believed , grown up when @entity21 was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world , and they saw themselves struggling with the complacency such power produced			2
@entity26 did not underestimate the difficulty of overcoming the problems it faced			2
at a time when the @entity66 was still years away and the fall of the @entity68 was impossible to imagine , @entity26 was concerned not only with the questions of economic equality but the entrenched racism of the @entity72 and the nuclear arms race			2
the organization conceded that much groundwork had to be laid if serious change was possible			0
" the first task of any social movement is to convince people that the search for orienting theories and the creation of human values is complex but worthwhile , " the @entity27 says			1
the group never said exactly how it would succeed at that task			0
but it was clear about what it wanted			0
" we would replace power rooted in possession , privilege , or circumstance by power and uniqueness rooted in love , reflectiveness , reason , and creativity			0
" @entity26 was not bothered by criticism that such a declaration of principles was too idealistic			2
it faced its critics head on			0
" if we appear to seek the unattainable , as it has been said , then let it be known that we do so to avoid the unimaginable , " the concluding lines of the @entity27 declare			0
the organization 's faith in people , particularly those belonging to its college - age generation , was knowingly idealistic			0
at the core of the @entity27 was @entity26 's unapologetic insistence : " we regard men as infinitely precious and possessed of unfilled capacities for reason , freedom , and love			1
" by the end of the 1960s , @entity26 was a spent force , but the values expressed in the @entity27 had a life of their own			1
they were echoed in the civil rights movement as well as in the social programs of @entity127 's @entity126 , and they continued into the 1970s with the antiwar movement			0
it is too early to predict what will follow from @entity2 , but the example of @entity26 and its @entity27 provides a basis for believing @entity2 rests on much more solid ground than its critics realize			1
as @entity2 's @entity136 , its daily mass meeting open to everyone , shows , the movement is not about to be intimidated by the charge -- even when voiced by those on the left -- that it is too elusive and too egalitarian for its own good			1
occupy @entity2 's september 29 @entity144 lists a multitude of grievances , ranging from anger about illegal house foreclosures to outsourcing jobs , but the declaration never departs from its core article of faith and source of appeal			1
they are registered in its opening sentence , " as we gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice , we must not lose sight of what brought us together			0
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			0

@entity165 : occupy @entity2 makes smart move by refusing to list demands
@entity170 : in 1962 , @entity26 's @entity27 did *n't* list demands
@entity170 says the values *outlined* in that *statement* lived on long after @entity26 ended
occupy allows room for all who have lost ground to bring *issues* to light , he writes
