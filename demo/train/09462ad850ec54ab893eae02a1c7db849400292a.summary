-- @entity1 wo n't look at video that appears to capture this week 's cargo airplane crash in @entity4			1
@entity1 used to be afraid to fly			0
he got over it by looking at flight safety data , learning that flying is way safer than driving and talking to lots of pilots and flight attendants			1
now @entity1 flies more than 175,000 miles per year and documents his journeys on his travel website			0
" since i used to be afraid to fly i do n't want to risk triggering any of my old emotions , " he said in an e-mail			1
" i just do n't need those kind of images in my head			1
" the fiery images are alarming			0
@entity20 - based cargo carrier @entity19 confirmed that @entity21 had just taken off from @entity22 in @entity4 en route to @entity24 when the crash occurred , killing all seven crew members aboard			1
an approximately three - minute video , which has not been authenticated by @entity0 , shows what appears to be the @entity30 jet climbing shortly after takeoff , stalling , rolling from side to side and crashing into the ground			1
while the video might trigger a fear of flying in usually calm travelers or terrify already fearful passengers , most travelers are n't flying under the kind of conditions faced at @entity22 in @entity4			1
here are five things to keep in mind as you head for your next commercial flight : civilian aircraft do n't fly at such a steep angle the circumstances under which military troops and cargo airplanes fly in and out of a war zone are far from the routines of commercial airlines , says @entity53 , a former @entity54 member and airline mechanic			1
" commercial airplanes climb at about half the angle the military climbs at , " @entity53 says			0
" military aircraft take off at a such a steep angle to get high enough to get away from local arms fire			0
they need to get over 3,000 feet as quickly as they can			0
" a commercial airline 's cargo hold is small ( and full ) a military aircraft carrying heavy equipment might not fill an entire cargo airplane , requiring that the cargo be secured to prevent a potentially deadly sudden shift in weight , @entity53 says			1
in contrast , aircraft configured for passengers have much smaller cargo compartments , which are filled with baggage and any cargo that the airline can pack into the belly of their planes			1
" full compartments leave no room for cargo to shift , " he says			1
one crash is not a trend simply watching a video of a crash is n't a problem , says @entity91 , a psychologist with the @entity92 of @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity93			1
it 's the interpretations people make after watching a plane crash or other disturbing news events over and over again			1
" i will get people up until 4 a.m. watching the @entity103 bombing story , " she says			0
" they think , ' this happens all the time , which means it could easily happen to me			0
' " monday 's plane crash in @entity4 " is compelling and very sad , " she says			1
" however , it 's very infrequent			0
airline travel is the safest form of travel			0
as @entity20 , we are very good at overdoing it			0
" an ' @entity116 ' to calm flying fears visuals can pack an intensified punch watching such a video can activate a different area of your brain than reading a story , @entity91 says			1
the visual stimulation can activate people 's fight or flight response , making them think they are in imminent danger			2
" your brain is telling you that a predator is after you , " @entity91 says			0
" reading about it does n't tend to cause the same reaction			2
" a small percentage of people worldwide suffer from fearful flying to the extent that it impairs them in some way , she says , and some people can become traumatized by watching and fixating on disturbing videos			1
people overestimate the threat and underestimate their ability to react , she says			2
@entity0 commenter @entity143 says he usually does n't suffer from fear of flying			1
yet one airplane crash stands out for him			2
ever since he watched all the 1996 news coverage about @entity147 , which blew up a few minutes after takeoff , @entity143 wrote via e-mail that he 's " acutely aware " of the early part of his flights			2
" now , having watched the @entity22 crash , i expect my existing takeoff anxiety to increase slightly			2
" we can come to terms with our fears try not to avoid or try to stop your fears , suggests @entity160 psychologist @entity159			2
" they are hard to stop and they find sneaky ways of reminding you they are there , " he wrote via e-mail			0
" instead , try to make peace with them			0
" his suggestions : " notice your network of fears			2
say the word ' flying ' or ' 747 ' and notice what else comes to mind in your network of fears			1
let 's say the word is ' crash			2
' rate your level of anxiety when you say the word aloud			0
repeat the word out loud for 90 seconds and notice what happens to the scariness of the word			0
try this exercise three times			0
" and remind yourself of why you 're traveling , @entity159 suggests			0
whether it 's a business trip or a much - anticipated getaway or a trip to see a loved one , the reasons can help you see past your fears			2
are you afraid to fly ? what do you do to keep calm on an airplane flight ? please share in the comments below .			0

flying fears may be intensified by video that appears to capture a cargo plane crash
remember that conditions for cargo flight in @entity4 are n't routine for passenger flights
*dramatic* visuals may evoke *instinctive* responses that *amplify* a small threat
