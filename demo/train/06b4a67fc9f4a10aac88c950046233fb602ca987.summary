-- two @entity1 and an @entity2 were awarded the @entity3 in chemistry on wednesday for painstakingly mapping out the thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome -- work that paves the way for new antibiotics			1
@entity1 researcher @entity11 is one of three scientists sharing the @entity13 in chemistry			1
inside all animals , plants and bacteria are dna molecules that contain the blueprint for life			2
ribosomes are an organism 's protein factories			2
they use the information in the @entity26 to make the tens of thousands of proteins that enable the organism to function properly			1
these proteins include hormones , enzymes and hemoglobin , which transports oxygen			0
from a medicinal standpoint , the ribosome is important because it is what antibiotics target			0
in a bacterial strain , antibiotics bind to the ribosomes , preventing them from making the proteins the bacteria need to survive			1
@entity1 @entity44 and @entity11 and @entity2 @entity45 shared the $ 1.4 million prize for mapping the position of the thousands and thousands of atoms that make up ribosomes			1
their three - dimensional models showed how different antibiotics bind to the ribosome			0
" these models are now used by scientists in order to develop new antibiotics , directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering , " said the @entity56 , which awards the prize			2
@entity44 , a @entity1 citizen who was born in @entity67 , is a senior scientist and group leader at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , according to the @entity3 web site			2
@entity11 is a professor at @entity74 and an investigator at @entity76 at @entity74 , the site said			0
yonath is a professor at the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity2 , and director of the @entity82 at the @entity79 , the @entity13 site said			1
the @entity13 are being awarded this week and next			0
the medicine award was handed out on monday and the one for physics on tuesday			0
the prize for literature will be awarded thursday ; the @entity88 winner will be named on friday , and the award in economics will be issued on monday .			0

two @entity1 , one @entity2 to share $ 1.4 million prize for work on ribosomes
ribosomes in every organism use info from @entity26 to make proteins needed for life
antibiotics work by binding to ribosomes of bacteria so they ca *n't* make proteins
@entity13 winners ' mapping of ribosomes helps in development of new antibiotics
