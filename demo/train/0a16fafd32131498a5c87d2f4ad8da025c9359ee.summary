having kept a relatively low profile since being forced to step down as @entity4 's premier last year , @entity3 , the bad boy of @entity4 politics , has decided to run for the fourth time as the centre - right 's prime ministerial candidate in a keenly awaited parliamentary election likely to take place in february			1
@entity4 needs a @entity3 comeback like it needs a hole in the head			0
the scandal - plagued @entity3 , who was recently sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud but has a knack of successfully appealing against his convictions , epitomizes the dysfunctional nature of @entity4 politics , with its discredited leaders and unstable governments			2
read more : is the eurozone crisis almost over ? over the past year or so , @entity23 , @entity4 's respected technocratic prime minister , has drawn attention away from these failings by restoring credibility to @entity4 policymaking			1
the problem was that @entity23 , who took over from @entity3 in november 2011 in the face of a bond market crisis , was always dependent on the parliamentary support of @entity3 's @entity32 ( @entity32 ) party to govern			1
he now no longer has the @entity32 's backing and says he 'll resign as soon as next year 's budget is passed			0
so what next for @entity4 , and is a " @entity3 sell - off " in the bond market in the offing ? to be sure , @entity3 's comeback is not entirely unexpected and is more about the implosion of , and dramatic loss of support for , the @entity32 ( not to mention its dependence on @entity3 for most of its funding ) than anything else			1
read more : the eurozone 's reluctant leader the real question , therefore , is whether investors have become too complacent about @entity4 in their expectation that policy continuity under the next government - which may yet include @entity23 - is more or less assured			2
i suspect they have to a degree and are now staring at the uncertain prospect of a @entity59 political landscape in @entity4			0
fortunately for @entity4 , the bond - buying programme of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) is providing a powerful counterweight to concerns about @entity4 politics			2
if @entity3 's party had withdrawn its support for @entity23 's government before @entity62 president @entity70 promised in late july to " do whatever it takes " to save the eurozone , @entity4 yields would have already risen sharply			1
this is not to say that investors wo n't start to reprice @entity4 credit risk in the coming days and weeks			0
rather , it suggests that the scope for a sharp and disorderly sell - off akin to the one @entity4 suffered in november 2011 is quite limited			0
still , @entity23 's decision to stand down as premier once parliament approves the 2013 budget provides the first big test for @entity4 's bond market since the @entity62 - driven rally in @entity4 debt began in late july			1
having shone mostly on @entity90 over the past few months , the spotlight of the markets is now shifting to @entity4			0
the most important priority for @entity4 policymakers is to maintain confidence in the country 's huge stock of government debt , the largest in the eurozone in absolute terms and the second - largest as a share of gdp after @entity101			2
this is why @entity4 's upcoming government bond auctions will be scrutinized for any sign that investors are losing confidence in @entity4 debt - particularly since foreign buyers of @entity4 debt are already few and far between			1
perhaps the most salient point about the latest developments in @entity4 is that investors should start paying more attention to idiosyncratic , or country - specific , risks			1
just because the @entity62 is prepared to intervene forcefully in @entity4 and @entity90 bond markets does not mean that the underlying problems of the eurozone 's third and fourth - largest economies respectively are being addressed			2
indeed , quite the opposite			0
@entity4 remains mired in recession and now faces weeks of political uncertainty at a time when it can least afford it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity125 .			0

@entity3 is making a fourth run for prime minister in @entity4 's upcoming parliamentary elections
@entity23 leaving is the first big test for @entity4 's bond market since the @entity62 *vowed* to save the eurozone in july , @entity125 says
@entity125 says developments in @entity4 show investors should start paying more attention to country - specific risks
