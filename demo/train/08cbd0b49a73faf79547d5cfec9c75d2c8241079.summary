the facebook page " black women do breastfeed " has existed since 2010 with a modest audience of some 2,000 people who follow it for news and conversations along with the occasional encouraging image of a breast - feeding mother			1
over the weekend , the page shared a picture of a woman breast - feeding at her graduation , prompting a chorus of social media cheers and jeers			1
while much of the reaction has focused on whether the picture is appropriate , the women behind " black women @entity18 " say its message is lost in the social media chatter			1
" it 's important for black women to see other black women breast - feeding , " said @entity25 , who started " black women @entity18 " in 2010 as a blog and @entity28 group			1
" seeing other black women breast - feeding provides a sense of broad community and support for those who are trying to do it			1
" if that sounds weird to you , look no further than a recent post on the @entity28 page asking , " if someone tried to talk you out of breast - feeding , what were their reasons ? " comments vary from , " my mom said that 's what poor people did in the old days " to " you wo n't make enough milk " or " it 's something that white people do			2
" that was n't @entity25 's experience growing up in a black family outside of the @entity59 , where it was n't unusual to see women breast - feed openly in public			1
she remembers seeing her mother breast - feed her sister and knew that one day she , too , would breast - feed her children			2
when she turned to the internet in 2009 for support after her son 's birth , she noticed that most images and personal stories did not include black women			2
or , when conversations included black women , they focused on how they breast - feed at lower rates than other racial groups			1
" i said to myself , ' hmm , we seem to be missing from this broader conversation , ' " said @entity25 , a married mother of two in @entity81 , @entity82			0
" but , as i went through my life , i knew black women who were breast - feeding , including me			1
i thought one thing i can do to broaden the conversation is collect stories of black women who are breast - feeding			1
" @entity92 mother @entity91 also breast - fed her five children , but somewhere along the way , a friend said to her " you 're the only black women i know who breast - feeds , " remember @entity91 , who joined " black women do breastfeed " as a co-administrator in late 2013			1
" it became important to me to see other black women breast - feed and make it visible that yes , black women do breast - feed , " @entity91 said			1
on the @entity28 page , links to news articles and studies garnered a few likes here and there , but things took a turn a few weeks ago when @entity91 posted an image of a woman breast - feeding			2
more women sent pictures for @entity91 to post and engagement increased , hitting a high with a split image of a woman breast - feeding alongside a picture of pop star @entity123 in a see - through dress			2
it included the caption , " why is it ok for a star to wear this but for me to breastfeed it 's a problem			0
" @entity131 decided to post the photo of herself breast - feeding her child while wearing her graduation cap and gown in the comments of that photo			2
it immediately got more attention than any other post ever on the page , @entity91 said , who could relate to being a young mom finishing college			0
" it was just beautiful ; it just spoke volumes , " @entity91 said			0
" breast - feeding is tough at the beginning , so to see a young mom who balanced breast - feeding and school , that 's amazing			2
" but on social media and in other areas , @entity153 saw some backlash			2
@entity91 offered to take the photo down , but @entity153 refused			0
" i found out i was pregnant my last year of college , had my daughter one week into my last semester , she was my motivation to keep going , so me receiving my @entity163 was our moment , " @entity153 said , according to a post on the page			0
" black women @entity18 " also received negative comments about its name and its focus on black women			2
it also received new support -- the audience climbed to more than 7,000 by wednesday afternoon			0
@entity25 spoke with @entity174 about breast - feeding , race and how " black women @entity18 " has grown to accommodate a diverse audience			1
the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity : @entity174 : why is the group named " black women @entity18 " ? @entity25 : i named it " black women @entity18 " so that people could be aware that there is community of black women who do breast - feed and who are interested in breast - feeding and want to share their experiences			1
one of the things i used to do when i was looking online for information about breast - feeding is put in search " black women breast - feed , " and i figured if i named it something like that , it would come up in searches			1
the name is not there to exclude anyone because from the very start , we 've had women and men of varying races express interest in being on the page , but black women need advocacy in this area as well			0
that does n't exclude women from joining the advocacy , it just recenters the conversation			0
in addition to making black women breast - feeding more visible , we 've made women who felt like they were the only ones doing it realize they 're not alone			1
we made women who may not have previously breast - fed their children see this community of women			2
there are women in this country who may be the first generation in their family to breast - feed			1
they may be the only women in their community who breast - feed , and that makes it difficult to find support			1
@entity174 : how does sharing pictures of women breast - feeding contribute to this goal ? @entity25 : in the @entity59 , even though we do have breast - feeding , it 's not seen as a common thing			1
it 's not really something you necessarily see walking down the street			0
for black women who do n't know other women who breast - feed in their community , it is important to see that is happening			1
@entity174 : why do you think this image went viral ? @entity25 : i think people were impressed that this young woman was able to graduate while taking care of a young infant			0
because people are not used to seeing breast - feeding in public in this country , we tend to get really nervous or scared or unsure or outright offended because many of us are not used to seeing breasts in that context			0
but , i think it 's important that photos like this are out there because women need to be able to breast - feed their babies and sometimes it needs to happen in public			1
babies need to eat , and they ca n't control other people 's feelings			0
i think it 's important that people remember this is about feeding a baby , and we as nation need to figure out how to manage our own personal feelings and allow women and babies to breast - feed as they need to			1
@entity174 : how have you handled the reaction on your page ? @entity25 : when it comes to social media , you will always see detractors , you will always see people who disagree			0
but i think it 's good to remember that for each of those detractors , there are more people saying ' we support her , and we do n't see anything wrong with this			0
' we 've been very heartened by the positive comments we 've seen , and we 've definitely seen a lot more positive than negative ones			0
for us , we 've tried not to fan the flames because we do n't want to contribute to any harm that might come , and we certainly hope there is n't any so we 're trying to be a little bit more low - key			0
we are assessing how we want to manage pictures in the future			0
we do n't want to discourage anyone who has pictures they want to share from doing so , but right now , our main concern is that women featured in pictures wo n't fear any harm from sharing them			0
@entity174 : do you think the reaction would 've been different if a white woman had appeared in the picture ? @entity25 : it 's really hard for me to say , but i think that maybe certain assumptions might not have been made if the person in the picture was not black because we 've had people questioning her devotion to her studies , questioning her lifestyle and just making slanderous comments			0
it 's really difficult to say , but i do think the reaction might have been a little different			0
as a new parent , did you feel encouraged to breastfeed -- or discouraged ? share your experience in the comments , on @entity343 with the hashtag # @entity344 or on @entity347 's facebook page .			0
