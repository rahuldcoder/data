@entity0 , @entity1 -- i normally do n't dwell on what i am going to wear before i go on a shoot			1
it 's usually something presentable , comfortable and preferably in a bright " tv " color that makes my cameraman @entity8 happy			2
this time , though , i was perplexed			0
i was about to film a story on manual scavenging			1
we were going to film people who clean human excreta			1
knowing i would have to get close to human waste while filming , i opted for a pair of old water - resistant hiking boots			1
i told @entity8 to wear old shoes too			0
my feet were prepared for what lay ahead			0
i did not expect to see people cleaning human waste from the roads right in the heart of @entity0 , a booming financial capital and the face of modern @entity1			1
' night soil ' it 's called manual scavenging -- the removal of human waste or " night soil " from sites where there is no flush system			1
though the @entity1 parliament passed @entity39 and @entity40 , in 1993 and reinforced the ban in 2013 , private contractors hired by the municipal government continue to employ them			1
@entity42 , 42 , has been doing this job since 2007			1
" of course i do n't like it , " he tells me			0
" but i have to feed my family			0
" @entity42 's day begins around 6.30 a.m. , seven days a week			1
he 's a contractor who works for the city of @entity0 , earning just $ 5 a day			1
usually , he walks to work			0
@entity42 carries a broom , while his colleague carries a tin plate			1
@entity42 sweeps , his partner scoops			1
according to various studies , nearly 50 % of @entity1 's population does n't have access to toilets -- which leaves them with no choice but to go outdoors			1
the situation is acute in villages			0
and as i found out , in cities too			0
i saw child after child carrying a mug of water come to the road where we waited with @entity42			1
they pulled their pants down and squatted on the edge of the kerb			0
they did their business and walked away , leaving @entity42 and his colleague with the grim task of cleaning up after them			1
" now i am used to it , " @entity42 says , admitting he found it hard when he first started the job			2
dehumanizing and dangerous another manual scavenger , @entity84 , who works in a different part of @entity0 says he would throw up every day when he started working			1
" if i take you to the same area i guarantee you will throw up too , " he says			0
it 's an incredibly dehumanizing and dangerous occupation			2
most manual scavengers do n't have appropriate equipment			2
he wears a flimsy jacket and thin cloth mask that he made himself			0
a pair of old sandals leave his feet covered in muck			0
those who clean gutters use bamboo sticks to clear jams , while standing in the middle of waste matter that can come as high as their chest			2
in some instances they must crawl through sewage			0
they hardly wear any protective gear			0
sometimes they do n't even wear a shirt			0
often , scavengers have to enter manholes too to clear blockages and it 's not uncommon for them to drink a quick swig of alcohol before starting their job			2
" they have to numb their senses , " @entity42 explains			2
" how else can anyone bear the stench ? " i know what he means			0
standing next to @entity42 while he worked was hard enough -- the smell was repulsive and overwhelming			1
life expectancy amongst manual scavengers is low			1
many develop asthma , skin infections and tuberculosis on the job			1
hundreds reportedly die from the work each year			0
according to the @entity0 based research organization @entity139 ( @entity139 ) , 80 % of the manual scavengers die before they turn 60 because of health problems			1
@entity139 says in @entity0 alone , an average of 20 sewer workers die each month from accidents , suffocation or exposure to toxic gases			2
caste systems persists most manual scavengers are @entity149 -- people belonging to the lowest strata of @entity1 's caste system			1
they were once considered " untouchable " and were forced to live outside the village boundary			0
though @entity1 's @entity155 bans caste - based discrimination , dalits are still marginalized , despite government efforts to end it			1
" they are the most vulnerable section of our society , " explains @entity159 , a labor activist fighting for the rights of manual scavengers			2
though dalits are not shunned the way they used to be , they are still discriminated against because of the work they do			0
@entity42 says it 's hard to get a cup of tea			1
he 's often turned away from restaurants			2
a few small tea vendors will serve him a cup of tea provided he stands on the road and does not enter their premises			0
if he rides a bus , people turn away when he climbs aboard			2
" it 's just easier if i walk home , " @entity42 says			1
at home , we meet his family			0
they have a young daughter who was at school			0
i asked @entity42 what hopes he has for his child			2
his wife jumps in to answer , her eyes brimming with tears			0
" not this work , " she tells me , " no way			0
" she 's going to finish school and she 's going to stand on her own two feet			2
" i had no choice , " he tells me			0
" perhaps it was my destiny			0
" @entity1 's current prime minister , @entity203 , hopes to change the future not just for @entity42 's daughter but for millions of @entity1 who are forced to live with unsanitary and unhygienic conditions every day			1
on october 2 , he 's launching a clean @entity1 mission -- a nationwide movement that aims to solve @entity1 's sanitation problems in five years			1
he 's the first prime minister to make cleanliness a national priority			2
lets hope he delivers on this promise .			0
