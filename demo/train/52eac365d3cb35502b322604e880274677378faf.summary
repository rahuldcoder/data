a trio of disasters that battered @entity3 journalism -- the suspension of @entity6 anchor @entity5 , followed by the unrelated deaths of @entity9 correspondent @entity8 and @entity11 media critic @entity10 -- could not come at a worse time for the news business			1
to see three nationally well - respected leaders in the field vanish in a week 's time has left many in the news business shaken			1
@entity5 deserves the least sympathy ; he caused his own unpaid suspension by repeatedly distorting and exaggerating key facts about a story he helped report over a decade ago , a breach that calls into question the level of quality control at a network that made him the face of news to 9 million nightly viewers			1
by contrast , the loss of @entity8 and @entity10 is an unmitigated tragedy			1
@entity8 , killed in a car accident , won dozens of @entity38 and famously put his life on the line in 1991 , when the forces of @entity43 dictator @entity42 held him and his news crew captive for 40 days , during which they were blindfolded , beaten and threatened with death			1
@entity10 was a fearless critic of media and was unafraid of exposing the inner workings of even the most powerful companies -- including his own beloved @entity11 , which he took to task for firing ex-executive editor @entity51 in an essay that my friend and journalist @entity53 and i included in a list of the best newspaper columns of 2014			1
@entity8 and @entity10 were professionals who graced their chosen field and showed how much good you can do with skill , grit and integrity			1
as one media critic put it , " both were classic , fearless , old - school journalists who stayed at the top of their craft for decades , winning plenty of awards for their work ... but more importantly , the respect of both their readers and those in the industry			2
" the loss of two stalwart truth - tellers leaves journalism weaker when it needs to be stronger on behalf of the public			1
media organizations , already reeling from shrinking audiences , have recently been forced to weather an unprecedented level of government stonewalling of basic information			2
" this trend has been especially pronounced in the federal government , " read a blistering letter from the @entity87 to the @entity89 administration			2
" we consider these restrictions a form of censorship -- an attempt to control what the public is allowed to see and hear			0
" equally disturbing is the fact the @entity89 administration has conducted more criminal prosecutions of whistleblowers under the @entity102 compared with any of the previous administrations			0
seven , to be precise			0
add a dose of direct violence -- notably , the recent kidnapping and beheading of journalists @entity108 and @entity110 by @entity111 -- and the challenges confronting an already troubled news industry start to look like the stuff of nightmares			1
that 's the bad news			2
the good news is that a rising generation of journalists , journeymen who have been perfecting their craft for years , are preparing to take the reins of leadership in the nation 's major newsrooms			2
here are three of the best , whose success is a reason to cheer			0
full disclosure : i have worked with all of them , and consider each of them dear friends			0
@entity133 , a longtime political reporter for @entity134 , graduates this week to a prominent post at the @entity11 , where she will anchor the paper 's politics web section and help drive coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign			0
@entity140 , editor in chief of @entity142 , recently scored a one - on - one interview with president @entity89 that is notable , in part , because @entity142 , which started less than a decade ago , is considered a leader among the new digital organizations that attract and cater to young millennials			0
and @entity53 , editor in chief of the @entity150 and a @entity12 contributor , took the reins after the departure of @entity154 and is growing the organization by leaps and bounds , deepening its national security coverage alongside a lively coverage of the mechanics of @entity161 and @entity162			0
a cadre of opinion journalists -- notably , @entity165 and @entity166 on the left , @entity168 and @entity169 on the right -- are diligently building reputations for wit , insight and creativity at a time when @entity3 are looking for new faces and voices			1
we have , indeed , lost some great , brave journalists lately			0
may the new generation live up to the legacy we 've inherited .			0
