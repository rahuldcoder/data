-- over the past few years , @entity1 has established his acting rep by playing @entity3 in " heroes , " a couple of memorable roles on " @entity6 , " and , of course , @entity8 in the last two " @entity10 " movies			1
so you could describe his transition into producing as , well , " logical			2
" certainly it has gotten off to an encouraging start			2
@entity1 produced director @entity16 's financial crisis movie @entity15 through the actor 's before the @entity19 company — the production outfit he runs with partners @entity21 and @entity23 — and exec produced @entity16 's @entity25 - starring " @entity26 , " which just screened at @entity27			1
through @entity29 , @entity1 has also produced the new film " @entity28 , " a nuptials - themed comedy which is told through the lenses of the wedding videographers			1
directed by @entity34 and starring @entity34 's brother @entity35 and @entity36 as the engaged couple this tale of a big - day - which - goes - horribly - awry is available on @entity40 from june 18			1
below , @entity1 talks about " @entity28 " and , below that , you can exclusively check out the movie 's new poster here which was created by @entity46 ( the designer responsible for the similarly eye - catching posters for @entity49 and @entity50 )			1
@entity0 : i 'm guessing you 're kind of happy to be talking about something which does n't involve spaceships			2
@entity1 : well , i 've been having a great time talking about all that stuff , too			1
no complaints ! but it 's always good to promote other projects that i have going on			2
the great thing about this movie is that it really is a friends and family situation			2
we 've known @entity34 and @entity65 ( @entity66 , who cowrote the film with the @entity34 brothers ) for years			1
and to be able to give them this opportunity and to bring all the other collaborators that they work with on a regular basis into the equation was really gratifying for us			2
one of our main tenets is providing opportnities for people that we 've loved and have inspired us for a long time and @entity34 and @entity65 are certainly among them			2
@entity0 : the wedding comedy is well - tilled ground			1
what attracted you to the project ? @entity1 : one of the other things that we 're really focused on at my production company is innovative storytelling , whether that means the story itself or the style in which the story is told			1
in this case , we felt like , yes , the wedding comedy has definitely been done and done very well by other people already			1
but what we felt was fascinating about this script was taking the found footage mode — that tends to be reserved for more horror , thriller , genre projects — and applying it to this more traditional romantic comedy			1
we 're really excited to be working with @entity105 and obviously this poster that they 've done up which is so incredible , to see all the faces of all of our friends in that kind of high art rendering , it 's really gratifying			2
it 's been all - round a really good experience and on the heels of everything else that i have going on			1
@entity0 : this film is different in almost every imaginable way from @entity15			1
was it a similarly different experience in terms of producing it ? or were many of the challenges and problems the same ? @entity1 : it was very different to produce this , just simply based on the budget			1
i mean , @entity15 was about a $ 3.5m film and this is a half of a million dollar film			1
so we had less resources and less time			0
it was also different because it was our friends and literally their family — you know , @entity34 and @entity141 are brothers and @entity34 's mom is in the movie and @entity65 's mom is in the movie			0
it really was a friends and family affair			0
we had a lot of good times while making it but we basically holed ourselves up in a hotel out by @entity153 and just were there for pretty much two weeks banging away all hours and shooting multiple pages a day			0
it was definitely a brisk experience but luckily the style of the film allowed for that to happen			1
it was really fun , but definitely a brief encounter			0
@entity0 : did making this movie alter your own views on marriage at all ? @entity165			0
. no. i think there 's a tremendous amount of heart in the film and i think the journey that @entity141 and @entity36 take in the movie is one that is very relatable in terms of people entering into that institution			2
but i would say my views on marriage are ambivalent at best anyway so i feel like it 's just sort of kept me in that same space			0
@entity0 : what 's the one practical lesson you 've learned as a producer ? @entity1 : not to sit in meetings where they 're talking about actors and actors ' value			1
there are certainly things i 've learned as a producer that no actor should ever know			0
and the way that we are talked about in financing meetings and casting meetings is one of them			0
so i recuse myself of those conversations with financiers until my business partners are able to handle that part of it and then i come in			0
@entity0 : when you say the " value " of actors you mean their actual financial value to a project ? @entity1 : yeah			1
you know , we all have a number attached to our name and that number is different domestically than it is internationally			0
it 's different in different territories and financiers really do break it down by those kind of metrics			0
it 's horrible because you 're talking about people and you 're talking about talented people and to hear them talked about in such a broad and impersonal way can be really disappointing			0
@entity0 : well , if it makes you feel any better , i feel like we 've all got a number by our names one way or another			0
yeah , you 're right			0
i guess that 's true			0
it does n't make me feel any better			0
