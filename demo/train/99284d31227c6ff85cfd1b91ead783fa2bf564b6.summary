@entity0 should be a cyclist 's dream			1
it 's pancake flat , it 's riddled with cycle tracks and almost everyone gets around on two wheels			1
there are so many bikes it looks like -- hard though this may be to imagine -- the @entity13 for normal riders			0
in reality , it 's a nightmare , or at least it is until you grasp the rules of the road -- and then it 's a blast			0
within seven minutes of taking possession of my @entity24 rental bike , a motor scooter nearly rams me into a canal			1
by the time my first hour is up , i 've been verbally abused for halting abruptly in a cycle lane , and been loudly tooted at by a tram after getting my tires stuck in its tracks			1
i 'm not the only one			0
all around @entity0 hapless bike - borne visitors can be seen wobbling into the paths of furious @entity24 cyclists			1
" tourists think they 're in @entity44 , " says @entity38 , who runs @entity39 , a side - street cycle hire and repair shop in the @entity24 capital			1
" and @entity24 people think they 're @entity46 on a bicycle			0
" it 's a problem			1
as soon as summer starts , i sell more of these things than anything else , " he adds , brandishing an enormous brass bike bell the size of a clenched fist			1
" customers come into my shop and scream ' arrrrgghh ! ' " with more rental bike shops opening every year , the problem could get worse -- unless , of course , tourists grasp the essentials of riding in @entity0			1
it 's not hard though			0
here 's what i picked up			0
ride it like you stole it pedal slowly while gawping at tulips , or stop to check your map , and pretty soon all of @entity0 will hate you			1
" when we 're on bikes , @entity24 people are always in a hurry , even when they 're not in a hurry , " says @entity74 , another @entity0 bike mechanic			1
" you do n't have to ride like us , but if you ca n't , just stay out of our way and you 'll be fine			0
" but make sure someone else does n't steal it " if it is n't locked to @entity90 , then expect it to go , " says @entity83 , an economics major from @entity85 , whose year - long studies in @entity0 have literally and figuratively included a crash course in @entity24 cycling			1
an estimated 55,000 bikes go missing annually in the city , fueling rumors of gangs targeting them to smuggle to @entity96			1
" people are afraid to buy brand new bikes , so they get some old thing for 100 euros ( $ 136 ) , " says @entity38			0
" but if you lock it to something secure the chances are better			0
" be careful where you lock it though			0
@entity0 authorities have begun removing bikes locked outside of extensive designated cycle parks on canals and at the central station			1
it 's a long walk to the pound on the outskirts of town to get it back			0
try not to look like a tourist using one of the major rental companies gives the advantage of a citywide support network , but it also saddles customers with a brightly colored bike			1
less cycle - related abuse is attracted from locals if the ride does n't shout " i 'm a tourist			2
" i rented mine from @entity129 , which offers " classic " @entity24 machines that blend in seamlessly with the crowds riding indestructible , gearless step - through bikes			0
there are plenty of other low key rental shops , and while the quality may not match that offered by the big chains , that 's not necessarily a problem			2
" having a bike that makes noises is a good thing , " says @entity83			2
" people can hear you coming and get out of your way			0
" expect the worst more advice from @entity83 : " if you go with the expectation that you 're probably going to die on your bike -- anything less than that , you should be happy			2
" she 's joking , but after my run - in with the scooter and tram , it 's advice that rings truer than one of @entity38 's giant bells			0
some @entity24 cyclists seem to invite the worst			2
i saw one man riding along a canal - side road while using both hands to operate his @entity161			0
i saw another man riding undeterred by the fact he was carrying crutches and had one foot in plaster -- perhaps from an earlier cycle accident			2
the good news is , according to @entity24 cycling organization @entity168 , @entity0 and the @entity24 have one of the lowest rates of serious cycling accidents in the world			1
cycle sober after a day dodging tram rails or being railed at by impatient locals , it 's tempting to park the wheels outside a canal - side pub to sink a few foam - topped @entity24 beers before setting off again			2
that 's probably the fastest route to the bottom of the @entity183			0
@entity0 might have a liberal outlook on most things , but cycling under the influence of alcohol or whatever else is on offer is n't legal -- unless you 're on the beer bike , a pedal - powered mobile bar			1
that 's not to say it does n't happen			0
" if you 're out after dark , assume everyone on a bike is drunk , " jokes @entity83			2
stick to the cycle paths @entity0 might resemble a cyclists ' free - for - all , with bikes zipping into every available space , but there are rules and cycling is n't permitted everywhere			1
sticking to the city 's 4,000 or so kilometers ( 2,480 miles ) of designated cycle path will ensure safety -- as long as other cyclists remain patient -- and get you there far faster			1
when no way is marked by a cycle symbol , then it 's possible to mingle with traffic			2
the city does have pedestrian zones , though , so sometimes it 's best to get off and walk			0
give your bike a name this is somewhat random parting advice from @entity83 , particularly as her gold - sprayed bone - rattler does n't have a name , until we both agree it should probably be called @entity225			2
" if you name your bike , you become one with the bike , " she adds , sagely			2
and then if you wind up in a canal , at least you 're not alone			0
got any more good tips for cycling in @entity0 ? let us know in the comments			1
