@entity0 -- the week - old teachers strike in @entity0 's public schools will continue into the new week , after a representative group of the @entity5 decided not to end the walkout even though union leaders and school officials had reached a tentative contract deal			1
the move left mayor @entity11 vowing to go to court to force teachers back to work , calling sunday 's actions by the union " a delay of choice that is wrong for our children			1
" the mayor announced in a statement that he 's asked city lawyers " to file an injunction in circuit court to immediately end this strike			1
" he contended the strike is illegal because " it is over issues that are deemed by state law to be nonstrikable , and it endangers the health and safety of our children			0
" " i will not stand by while the children of @entity0 are played as pawns in an internal dispute within a union , " @entity11 said			1
members of the teachers ' bargaining team detailed the proposed contract to a group of 800 union representatives , called the @entity44 , in a meeting sunday afternoon			2
but @entity5 president @entity46 said that , after extensive debate , the delegates said they wanted more time to discuss the contract with union members			0
the @entity44 will reconvene tuesday afternoon , at which point delegates could decide to end the strike -- or not			2
if they do , classes could resume at earliest on wednesday			0
and even if the strike is ended , the more than 26,000 - member union 's rank - and - file would still have the opportunity at some point to accept , or reject , the proposed contract			1
as of sunday , though , @entity60 said a " clear majority " of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract			2
" they are not happy with the agreement , " @entity60 said			0
there were no classes all last week for more than 350,000 students in @entity0 , home to the nation 's third - largest school system , when the union went on strike after failing to reach a contract agreement with school board officials			1
why they teach despite it all the negotiations have taken place behind closed doors			0
publicly , the past week has been marked by sometimes biting remarks , as well as vocal picketing in and around the city 's schools , some of which opened for a few hours each weekday to give some students a place to go during the strike			1
both sides indicated friday that they 'd reached a tentative agreement , though teachers union leaders stressed then that any decision to end the strike or not would be determined this weekend			1
@entity60 , from the teachers union , said that one problem is that " there 's no trust " of school board members			1
delegates found several elements of the contract problematic , with the union president calling job security chief among them			2
" the big elephant in the room is the closing of 200 schools , " @entity60 said			1
" ( @entity5 members ) are concerned about this city 's decision on some level to close schools			1
" it was not immediately clear where @entity60 got the 200 figure or when she believes such school closures might happen			1
but @entity120 , a spokeswoman for @entity121 , called @entity60 ' claim " false , " asserting that union leaders said a few days ago that 100 schools would close , and " i 'm sure it 'll be another number tomorrow			1
" " all ms. @entity46 is trying to do is distract away from the fact that she and her leadership are using our kids as pawns in this process , " @entity120 told @entity1 by e-mail			0
another point of contention involves the teacher evaluation system , @entity60 said			0
the tentative contract would change it for first time since 1967 , taking into account " student growth ( for the ) first time , " according to the school system			0
and those teachers who are rated as " unsatisfactory and developing " could potentially be laid off			0
a parent on the impact of the strike principals would keep " full authority " to hire teachers , and the school system will now have hiring standards for those with credentials beyond a teacher certification			1
in addition , " highly rated teachers " who lost their jobs when their schools were closed can " follow their students to the consolidated school , " according to a summary of the proposed contract from @entity121			2
this contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school - age students , 10 more " instructional days " each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system , as opposed to the two schedules now in place , depending on the school			0
the pay structure would change with a 3 % pay hike for the first year of the contract , 2 % for the second year and 2 % for the third year			0
if a trigger extends the contract to four years , teachers would get a 3 % pay increase			0
@entity5 members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days , health insurance contribution rates will be frozen and the " enhanced pension program " is being eliminated			0
as is , the median base salary for teachers in the @entity0 public schools in 2011 was $ 67,974 , according to the system 's annual financial report			1
with the strike now continuing , the school system plans to open 147 " @entity194 " sites citywide monday for students to go to , in addition to programs run by the city 's park department and neighborhood organizations , @entity190 president @entity189 said			2
but @entity189 said that he , like the mayor , is " extremely disappointed " that such programs are necessary			0
he noted that classes began , for some students , on august 13 and that he did n't understand why they could n't continue as work continues to finalize a contract deal			0
" there is no reason why our kids can not be in school while the union reviews the agreement , " @entity189 said			0
for high school athletes , strike could put scholarships on the line @entity1 's @entity218 contributed to this report .			2
