-- @entity2 researchers say they have discovered the smallest known @entity4 dinosaur , a carnivore that roamed areas of the continent 75 million years ago and weighed less than most modern - day house cats			1
researchers say @entity9 , whose name means " western claw , " was about 1.6 feet tall			1
hesperonychus elizabethae , a 4.4 - pound ( 2 - kilogram ) creature with razor - like claws , ran through the swamps and forests of southeastern @entity16 , @entity2 , during the @entity17 , the researchers said			1
the diminutive dinosaur likely hunted insects , small mammals and other prey , perhaps even baby dinosaurs , said @entity23 , a paleontology research associate in the @entity25 's @entity24			2
" it 's basically a predator of small things , " @entity23 said			2
@entity23 co-wrote a paper on the dinosaur with @entity32 paleontologist @entity31			0
the paper appeared in monday 's @entity34			0
the researchers said the clawed dinosaur was slight , ran on two legs and had dagger - like teeth			1
it had an enlarged sickle - shaped claw on its second toe , the researchers said			1
although fossilized remains of @entity9 were collected in 1982 , they remained unstudied until @entity23 came across them in the @entity32 's collection in 2007 , the university said			1
because of their size , some of the fossilized parts had been thought to be from juveniles			0
@entity23 said he suspected the claws had come from another , smaller adult species , but said finding a fossilized pelvis in which the hip bones were fused -- which happens only once an animal is fully grown -- convinced him			0
" the claws were kind of a bread - crumb trail that we followed along , " until finding the well - preserved pelvis , @entity23 said			2
@entity23 and @entity31 determined that @entity9 , whose name means " western claw , " stood about 1.6 feet ( 50 centimeters ) high			1
albertonykus borealis , a 2.5 - foot - long insectivore , had been previously thought to be the smallest @entity4 dinosaur			2
@entity23 came across the dinosaur 's bones in storage at the @entity69 in @entity70 and decided to analyze them , @entity65 reported in september			0
a dinosaur smaller than @entity9 has been found in @entity73 , @entity23 said			1
he said he found searching through museums ' storage more productive in the short term than working in the field			0
" people collect stuff so much more quickly than they can process , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity80 contributed to this report .			0
