-- @entity1 will launch its long - awaited @entity3 app at @entity6 's @entity5 launch event on october 4 , @entity0 has learned			1
in addition to the @entity3 app , @entity1 is also expected to release a revamped version of its @entity5 app and may unveil an @entity12 - based mobile app marketplace			1
the @entity1 @entity3 app , which leaked earlier this year , has been in limbo at @entity1 for the past few months			1
that much was made clear in a blog post monday by former @entity1 engineer @entity16			0
in that post , he revealed that he left the company ( for @entity19 ) partially because @entity1 has been sitting on the completed app since may			2
the problem , according to two sources familiar with the situation , has been a combination of timing and a strained relationship with @entity6			1
it 's no secret that the two companies have been at odds over various issues during the past two years			0
for example , the social network pulled the plug on @entity34 in @entity35 because @entity6 did n't give @entity1 any warning about the feature , which would have eaten a great deal of bandwidth on @entity1 's side			1
we 've also heard rumors that @entity1 was supposed to be integrated into @entity43			0
this was meant to happen years ago , but disagreements on both sides eventually led to @entity6 integrating @entity47 into @entity48			0
the relationship between the two technology giants is warming up , however , thanks to the shared goal of beating @entity19 -- and the simple fact that @entity1 and @entity6 may need each other			1
the former does n't have a mobile platform while @entity6 does n't have a social platform			0
the culmination of this renewed friendship : the launch of @entity1 for @entity3 at @entity6 's iphone 5 media event			1
at this event , our sources also expect @entity1 to unveil a new version of @entity1 for the @entity5 , with design and speed improvements that mimic the @entity3 app. @entity1 has also been working on a project to bring the @entity70 to mobile devices			1
the project , labeled " @entity76 " by some ( a name not used internally at @entity1 , according to one of our sources ) , is designed to be a platform where developers can bring their @entity1 apps to mobile devices via an @entity12 platform			2
what we 're hearing is that @entity6 is actually working with @entity1 on perfecting the @entity12 platform			2
this could also launch at @entity6 's upcoming @entity5 event , though our sources would n't commit to a specific launch date for the platform			1
@entity1 decided not to launch it at f8 , as it did n't want to water down the announcement of the new @entity88 and @entity89			0
when we said last week that @entity1 would be profoundly changed , we were n't just referring to the new @entity88 and the " frictionless sharing " touted by @entity91			0
we were also talking about its secretive effort to become a mobile platform for the social web			0
and thanks to @entity6 , it looks like that effort is about to come to fruition			0
we 've reached out to @entity6 and @entity1 for comment			2
@entity0 's @entity99 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 is also expected to release a revamped version of its @entity5 app
@entity3 app , which leaked earlier this year , has been in limbo at @entity1 for months
sources say it 's been a combination of timing and a strained relationship with @entity6
