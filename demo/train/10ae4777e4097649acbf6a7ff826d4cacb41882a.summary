a common benchmark in the @entity2 for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol - related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive , transportation safety investigators say			1
the @entity6 recommended on tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood - alcohol content ( @entity9 ) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving			1
" most @entity2 think that we 've solved the problem of impaired driving , but in fact , it 's still a national epidemic , " @entity6 chairman @entity16 said			1
the idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving , which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the @entity2			2
@entity6 looks to technology to end drunken driving in the @entity2 @entity16 said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving , including a range of federal and state policies , tougher law enforcement , and stronger advocacy			1
but she said too many people are still dying on @entity2 's roads			0
the board acknowledged that there was " no silver bullet , " but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels			1
" in the last 30 years , more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol - impaired driving			2
what will be our legacy 30 years from now ? " @entity16 asked			0
" if we do n't tackle alcohol - impaired driving now , when will we find the will to do so ? " lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually , the safety board said			1
under current law , a 180 - pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour , according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the @entity62			1
that same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period , according to the calculator			2
@entity69 rules against police in drunk driving case many factors besides gender and weight influence a person 's blood alcohol content , and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel			1
the @entity6 investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues			1
it can not impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures , including @entity89			0
but the independent agency is influential on matters of public safety and its decisions can spur action from like - minded legislators and transportation agencies nationwide			1
states set their own @entity9 standards			0
the board also recommended on tuesday that states vastly expand laws allowing police to swiftly confiscate licenses from drivers who exceed the blood alcohol limits			1
and it is pushing for laws requiring all first - time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed			2
in the early 1980s , when grass - roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving , many states required a 0.15 @entity9 rate to demonstrated intoxication			0
but over the next 24 years , @entity118 and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 @entity9 standard , the last state falling in line in 2004			0
the number of alcohol - related highway fatalities , meanwhile , dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011 , the @entity6 said			1
drunk - drive blood tests divide @entity69 in recent years , about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment , the @entity6 said			1
" i think .05 is going to come			0
how long it takes to get there , we do n't know			0
but it will happen , " said the @entity6 's @entity133 , who helped guide the staff report			1
for some , the vote struck close to home			0
@entity6 board member @entity137 noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15 - year sentence in a related death			1
many of the recommendations " are going to be unpopular , " @entity137 said			0
" but if we keep doing what we 're doing , we 're not going to make any difference			0
" the @entity6 cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a bac of 0.05			1
currently , more than 100 countries on six continents have @entity9 limits set at 0.05 or lower , the safety board said			1
the @entity6 has asked all 50 states to do the same			2
@entity157 : teen drinking and driving rates cut in half a restaurant trade association , the @entity161 , attacked the main recommendation , saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent @entity9 after consuming one drink			2
the group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the @entity170 ( @entity170 )			0
but @entity170 told @entity171 on tuesday it no longer uses that chart " as there are many variables " that contribute to an individual 's level of intoxication			0
a new @entity170 chart shows a person with a 0.05 bac level experiences " reduced coordination , reduced ability to track moving objects , difficulty steering , ( and ) reduced response to emergency driving situations			2
" a beer industry trade group said it would examine @entity6 's recommendation for lowering the blood - alcohol threshold			1
" however , we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results : by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with @entity9 of ( 0.15 ) or more , " said @entity189 , president of the @entity190			1
the safety board also recommend that @entity170 provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes			0
@entity170 , which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data , said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower @entity9 standard to " gather further information on that approach			0
" at tuesday 's meeting , the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist 's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a @entity9 limit , or refuses to take the @entity9 test			2
some 40 states already use the administrative tool , which the @entity6 believes is effective because it is swift and immediate			2
and the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors , which police can use to " sniff " the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol			2
the sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints			2
if the sensor alerts , it is grounds for more thorough testing			0
the @entity6 recommended last december that states require ignition interlocks for all @entity246 offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance			1
tuesday 's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol - related crash in @entity2 history			0
on may 14 , 1988 , a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on @entity256 near @entity257 , @entity258			0
the truck hit a school bus , killing 24 children and three adults			0
more than 30 others were hurt			0
what sways teens not to drink , drive ? stories , not stats			0

for a decade , 0.08 has been the blood alcohol benchmark to consider a driver intoxicated
@entity6 would like to see a nationwide 0.05 level
the board would also like to see swifter action on taking away offenders ' licenses
restaurant , beer industries say focus should be on repeat offenders
