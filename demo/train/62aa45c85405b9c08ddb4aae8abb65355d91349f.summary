@entity1 , @entity0 -- he 's the man who has just rejected offers of up to $ 700,000 a week in wages -- but who really is @entity7 ? and what has he done to deserve so much money ? wanted man : @entity7 overcame a spine fracture before getting to the top of world football			1
born in @entity14 in 1982 , @entity7 , or " @entity7 " as he is more commonly known , is a footballer with @entity16 club @entity15			1
his name , @entity7 , is believed to come from a brother , who began calling him that due to his inability to say his proper name -- @entity7			2
said to be an amazing talent from a very young age , the attacking midfielder began his career with @entity26 at the tender age of eight , and had signed his first contract before his 16th birthday			1
do you think @entity7 should have stayed at @entity15 or taken the money at @entity32 ? tell us in the @entity35 box below			1
however , when all seemed set for a perfect career , @entity7 suffered a serious , potentially paralyzing injury from a swimming pool accident in 2000			1
the then 18 - year - old fractured a vertebra in his spine -- an injury that many thought could have ended his career and even prevented him from walking again			2
@entity7 did recover though , and it 's something that the deeply religious @entity46 has put down to the help of @entity48 , and ever since has given some of his income to his @entity51			1
once recovered , he did n't waste time in getting his career restarted			0
by january 2001 he had made his debut in the @entity26 senior team and led the team to its first @entity57 championship			0
the following year he was a part of the @entity14 team which won the @entity60 , and in 2003 his talents had attracted the interest of @entity64 clubs and he signed to @entity15 for euro 9 million ( $ 12 million ) per season , and remains under contract with them through 2013			2
since then he 's won the @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 with @entity15 , while on a personal level he won the 2007 @entity71 for the best player in @entity64 and the @entity73 2007 -- among many other awards			1
his international performances have continued to be strong -- and he has now scored 23 goals for @entity14			0
such is his influence inside and outside of football , that @entity7 was named in the @entity80 most influential people in 2008			2
outside of the game @entity7 has continued to be a devout @entity82			0
he married his long - time partner @entity83 in 2005 , and they had their first child in june 2008			0
oddly , the current season ( in which he finds himself being offered the biggest football salary ever ) has n't been as profitable for @entity7			0
the 26 - year - old has struggled with a groin injury and has not managed to combine as smoothly within the @entity15 team compared to previous seasons			0
still , that did not seem to worry @entity32 -- or @entity94 , and for now at least , the $ 150 million transfer effort remains the biggest in football 's history .			0
