-- she may have charmed audiences in " @entity4 " and " @entity3 , " but @entity6 's sweet demeanor belies a criminal history			1
" i used to steal my older sister 's pink - and - green @entity10 mascara , " says @entity8 , 33			1
" i see myself as optimistic , and i think that can be confused with being innocent and naïve			2
" although the @entity19 native , who appears this month in the movie " @entity21 " and in the upcoming " @entity22 , " has " outgrown petty theft , " she says , she has n't outgrown her love of mascara -- or any other beauty products			1
spend time with the actress and she 'll offer you a dab of her favorite lip balm ( @entity28 ) and a sample of her tooth - whitening system ( @entity31 )			2
when it comes to makeup , she 's more a giver than a taker these days			1
" if i outgrow something , i like to share it			2
it 's good to be my friend when i clean out my makeup bag ! " how skilled are you at doing your own makeup ? it 's a learning process			1
i can do a decent job , but i like to leave it to the professionals when it counts			1
when i first moved to @entity49 i got a callback , and a producer said he 'd like to see me with more makeup			1
but he told my agent that she might have to put it on " because i did n't seem like the kind of girl who would know how			2
" and he was right ! i had to go into the bathroom at my agency and have my agent do my makeup			1
have you come a long way since then ? i still keep it pretty simple , although i like getting dolled up to hang out with friends			0
sometimes , if you need a pick - me - up , there 's nothing better than a new lip gloss			1
at any given moment , i can have upwards of 10 glosses in my purse			0
and i am addicted to perfumes			0
i love @entity74 's scents -- the @entity75 , the @entity77 @entity76 , and the @entity78			1
i do n't have a signature scent ; i switch depending on my mood			0
is there another product you are more faithful to ? if i 'm outdoors , i 'm constantly reapplying sunscreen			0
my sister used to call me @entity86 because i was so pale			0
i went to @entity87 this summer and decided i 'd be a rebel and sit out in the sun wearing a sunscreen with a low @entity90			1
the next day i woke up with a rash all over my body			0
my skin rejects the sun. i had a grown man at a water park once yell at me to get a tan			1
a water - park heckler ? me in a swimsuit -- that 's a lot of pale skin ! how do you take care of it ? i get regular facials			1
i had some skin problems when i was starting to film " @entity4			1
" i had really dry skin			2
i went to @entity109 at @entity110 in @entity111 , and she got it under control			0
i 've been going there since then for the standard facial			0
what do you do for your hair ? @entity120 shampoo keeps the richness in it			2
i really like red , but i 'm always open to change			0
i would love to cut my hair and try platinum -- @entity124 blond			1
have you gone blond before ? i 've had red hair for the past four years			1
before that , i never thought of being anything but blond			2
there was a definite shift in my life when i decided to go red			0
i tend to laugh a lot , and i can be really silly			0
i think when you have blond hair , people associate those behaviors with being flighty			1
with red hair , you 're suddenly quirky			2
what is your quirkiest beauty tool ? i love the classic @entity145 hot rollers			2
i put my makeup on , take them out , spray , then just shake my head and i 'm ready			2
i think hot rollers are making a comeback ! anything on your wish list ? i always wanted to be taller			1
[ @entity8 is 5 feet , 5 inches			0
] i was a dancer , so i always admired that willowy effect			0
i still look at it with a sense of longing , but i fully accept i ca n't change it			0
get her look makeup to create @entity8 's smoky eyes , makeup artist @entity163 pressed @entity165 in @entity166 ( $ 20 ; shuuemura - usa.com ) on the eyelids			1
she neutralized the blue by blending it with taupe shadow , then used pearly green liner on the inside rims of the bottom lids			0
she applied beige lip pencil and finished with a slick of cover girl @entity176 in @entity178 ( $ 6 ; drugstore.com )			0
hair to build @entity182 bouncy waves , hairstylist @entity180 set @entity8 's hair in pin curls for 20 minutes after winding 2 - inch sections around a curling iron			1
when he removed the pins , he added mousse and brushed through the waves with a mixed - bristle paddle brush			0
he then lightly teased the crown , spraying in @entity193 dry shampoo ( $ 16 ; folica.com ) for texture			0
