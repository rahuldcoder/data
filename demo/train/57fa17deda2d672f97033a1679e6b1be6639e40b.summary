-- can i level with you ? the guy made me nervous			2
all those flashy jump cuts and strobe - like visual progressions from one scene to another ! i do n't go to movies to make myself more nervous			2
i go to movies to slow time down or make it vanish altogether			2
the movies of @entity13 , who jumped to his death sunday from a bridge in @entity16 , were high , hard adrenaline shots injected into the audience 's collective nervous system to make time ( and your head ) explode			1
his name on the credits virtually assured the moviegoer of a ride that rivaled @entity28 's @entity27 for gut - wrenching , head - spinning thrills that would leave you wobbly at the end			2
@entity34 director @entity13 dead after jumping from @entity36 bridge they were n't to everyone 's taste -- and not always to mine			1
and yet , i am altogether certain that over the next several decades , @entity13 's movies will be among the very first pored over by cinema scholars tracing the development of the action - movie genre , cultural historians seeking clues as to the jittery mood swings of the @entity49 mindset at the turn of the 21st century and aspiring filmmakers who simply want to know how the hell he mesmerized people in the first place			1
establishing @entity56 and @entity57 as action movie icons , however considerable ( or unlikely ) that achievement , is n't even half of @entity13 's legacy			1
unlike his older brother @entity64 , whose credits roamed the categorical countryside from science fiction ( " @entity71 , " " @entity72 " ) to period adventure ( " @entity73 , " " @entity74 " ) to contemporary bloodbaths ( " @entity69 , " " @entity70 " ) , @entity13 maintained a signature style throughout his career that arguably yielded a steadier rate of success			1
his first feature , the 1983 erotic vampire mood piece " @entity80 , " ended up a relative anomaly ( except in sheer style ) to such high - octane thrill machines as " @entity85 " ( 1986 ) , " @entity86 " ( 1990 ) , " @entity87 " ( 1991 ) , " @entity88 " ( 1993 ) , " @entity89 " ( 1995 ) , " @entity90 " ( 1998 ) , " @entity91 " ( 2004 ) , " @entity92 " ( 2005 ) , " the taking of @entity93 1 2 3 " ( 2009 ) and " unstoppable " ( 2010 )			0
" @entity85 " director left notes before jump most of these movies -- and their protagonists -- were governed by seemingly impossible deadlines			1
to watch " @entity87 , " " @entity89 , " " @entity90 , " " @entity93 " and " @entity101 " is to feel pressed for time			0
their heroes had no time to think , and neither did you			0
propulsion , urgency , energy - for - the - sake - of - its - expenditure were the only guiding principles of @entity13 's movies , and yet as you were pressed against your seat by their momentum , you somehow could n't help being transfixed by the images			2
the change of each frame from oily to sooty , from sleek to parched , from cramped to wide - open , seemed at once abrupt and flowing			0
maybe the din and distortions were n't your flagon of grog			0
but few filmmakers before or since have been able to consistently orchestrate such maddening elements into a metal rock flow			1
having a good script always helps -- and @entity127 's contributions to both " @entity88 " and " @entity89 " make those the @entity13 movies that the smarty - pants critics like to single out			1
" @entity85 " will remain the first thing people mention when they mention his name , and there 's a lot to be said for the charm and efficiency of the relatively laid - back but no less riveting " unstoppable			0
" ( it 's almost as if he was starting to calm down at last			0
) but grump that i am , the @entity13 movie i 'm going to single out for special scrutiny is one of his least successful -- at least , financially			1
" @entity92 , " whose story was inspired by the real - life adventures of a movie star 's daughter turned bounty hunter ( played by @entity145 ) is one of the more subversive action epics ever made , precisely because of the things that drive you crazy about it : set pieces that make you dizzy and giddy at the same time , patchwork plot devices that literally veer all over the map , lighting and scenery oozing raw menace and hyperbolic performances that somehow stay fixed on the narrative core			0
i did n't always enjoy it as i was watching it			0
but parts of it stuck with me long afterward			0
i could say the same for most of @entity13 's films -- and , for that matter , his entire career			1
join the conversation on @entity173			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			2

@entity176 says @entity13 films were adrenaline shots injected into the audience
he says scholars will see them as *emblematic* of jittery @entity49 mindset at dawn of 21st century
he says films ' protagonists -- @entity189 , @entity56 among them -- *faced* impossible deadlines
@entity193 : few could orchestrate maddening elements into metal rock flow like @entity13
