-- record - breaking cold across the @entity1			1
record - breaking heat in @entity3			1
makes you wonder what 's up with @entity6			1
for example , @entity8 heat made news all week -- for better or worse			1
@entity3 saw a record - setting winter heat wave , but on friday , gov. @entity12 delivered the bad news : he declared a drought emergency , after seeing little rain since 2012			1
that announcement came two days after @entity17 , @entity3 , reached 83 degrees wednesday , smashing a record for the date by 8 degrees			1
at the other extreme , it was just last week that a polar vortex delivered some of the coldest temperatures in two decades to the @entity1 and @entity25			1
have @entity26 and @entity6 gone @entity27 on us ? as it turns out , there 's nothing sinister at work			1
it 's natural variability , meteorologists say			2
" it happens every year , it just varies in intensity , " said @entity36 , a @entity0 weather producer			1
last year in mid-january , many @entity39 were wondering why it was so warm compared to most years			2
but now it 's the opposite -- well , for much of the country			2
it depends on where you live in relation to the jet stream			0
the jet stream is a ribbon of wind that flows west to east high across the globe , typically at 110 mph , although its speed can often top 200 mph			0
think of it as an aerial highway along which storms travel along			0
but the jet stream fluctuates north and south			0
it drives our temperature variability daily			0
one day you might be below a ridge in the jet stream and its warmth , and days later , a trough or dip will send brrrrr - utality your way			0
the @entity68 says climatologists in recent years observe a more wavy pattern to the jet stream , bringing outbreaks of colder weather to the areas of the @entity75 -- including the @entity39 and @entity76			2
" whether this is normal randomness or related to the significant climate changes occurring in the @entity80 is not entirely clear , especially when considering individual events , " @entity68 says on its climate.gov website			0
it 's something @entity83 meteorologist @entity83 talked about last week when asked to explain the polar vortex that was leading to the coldest temperatures in many states in decades			1
when asked if it was a side effect of global warming , his response was , it 's under review			1
" this is a hotly researched topic			0
in short , yes , it could be , " he said			0
" it seems counter-intuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one , but some research shows that it could			1
" we know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet , melting of the @entity104 , etc. this includes extreme distortions of the jet stream , which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter , " he said			1
@entity110 , the president of the @entity111 , says more study is needed on whether @entity80 warming will have a big effect on northern climates			2
in nature , air north of the jet stream is cold , and to the south it is warmer			0
but the @entity80 is getting warmer			0
" we 're relaxing or loosening that difference in temperature and that changes the jet stream and loosens it some , " he told viewers of a @entity124 video chat last week			0
" i think this is an area we have to look ( at ) ... closely in the science			0
i think it is quite plausible			0
" he agreed it 's too early to say with certainty			2
but a study by @entity138 of @entity140 's department of atmospheric science found no support for the increased temperatures in the @entity80 leading to additional slow - moving weather patterns			1
she described the relationship between the @entity80 and the weather to its south as " complex			2
" in the study , published last august , she said there are likely influences from other parts of the world and internal variability			0
as scientists press ahead in their research , this month 's jet stream reached far down to the @entity159 , bringing such frigidity that @entity1 resorted to outlandish experiments , such as tossing a cup of boiled water into the outdoor air and watching it turn to snow			1
finally this week , a weather ridge in the @entity8 pushed the jet stream back into @entity169 , to the relief of many @entity39			2
@entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0

scientists ca *n't* for certainty whether global warming is behind wacky weather
a heat wave and a drought emergency befall @entity3
but the @entity1 and @entity25 see coldest temperatures in decades this month
have @entity26 and @entity6 gone @entity27 on us ?
