-- heavy crude oil flowing like a river through a central @entity4 neighborhood could keep residents away for several more days as crews work to clean it up			1

the cause of the leak was undetermined , he told @entity0 affiliate @entity24 in @entity25			0

" hopefully in the near immediate future we can get residents back into certain areas of the neighborhood , " @entity33 spokesman @entity32 said sunday as reporters were given a tour of the neighborhood			1
@entity41 , which owns the 60 - year - old pipeline , met with displaced residents over the weekend to explain how they can make claims for losses			1

resident @entity52 complained to @entity0 affiliate @entity54 that being forced to leave his home was frustrating			2
