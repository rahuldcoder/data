-- @entity2 's defense team was expected to call more witnesses friday , a day after presenting testimony that seemed to try to create doubts about forensic evidence presented earlier in the case			1
on thursday , the first day the defense began calling witness , @entity9 's attorney @entity8 called several to testify about the evidence			1
two of them were @entity16 examiner @entity15 and @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity20 crime scene technician @entity19 who said that testing found no blood on any of @entity9 's clothes , in her car trunk or in the interior of the car			1
prosecutors allege that @entity9 , 25 , killed @entity2 in 2008 by using chloroform on her and putting duct tape over her nose and mouth			1
they allege she then put the little girl 's body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home			2
@entity2 's skeletal remains were found december 11 , 2008			1
although she was last seen june 16 of that year , her disappearance was not reported until july 15 , after @entity9 's mother demanded answers from her daughter about @entity2 's whereabouts			1
@entity9 faces seven counts in @entity2 's death , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			2
she has pleaded not guilty , and her defense attorney has said that when all the facts are known , his client 's innocence will become clear			2
the defense has said @entity2 was not killed but rather drowned in the family pool june 16			1
@entity8 told jurors in his opening statements that @entity9 and her father , @entity9 , panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death			2
@entity9 rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial			2
@entity65 discussed the execution of a search warrant at the @entity9 home on august 6 , 2008 , and his duties , which were to examine the clothing in @entity9 's closet with an alternative light source for any stains			1
@entity19 testified that no stains were found on the pants @entity9 wore june 16 , 2008 , the day @entity2 was last seen			1
however , he acknowledged to prosecutor @entity76 on cross-examination that @entity9 's mother , @entity78 , told authorities she had washed the pants after that day			2
@entity15 , who was a forensic dna examiner for the @entity16 in 2008 , told jurors in the @entity84 courtroom that testing showed an indication of possible female dna on a shovel			0
previously , the @entity90 ' next - door neighbor , @entity89 , testified that @entity9 asked to borrow the shovel from him june 18 , 2008 , saying she wanted to dig up a bamboo root			1
@entity89 said she returned the shovel shortly afterward			0
however , @entity15 said the amount on the shovel was so small she could draw no scientific conclusions from it			0
testing showed no blood present in @entity2 's trunk , she said			1
" if a method is used to kill someone that does n't involve bloodshed , then the absence of blood does n't really say it did n't happen , correct ? " prosecutor @entity103 asked @entity15			0
" correct , " she replied			0
" i ca n't speak to whether it happened or not			0
" but she told @entity8 that as fluids leave the body during decomposition , it is likely that blood could be among them -- if there is a hole in the plastic bag holding a body , for instance			0
@entity15 also tested three pieces of duct tape found at the scene where @entity2 's remains were recovered , two of them covering the mouth portion of her remains			1
she testified that a dna profile generated on the outside of the tape matched another @entity16 forensic examiner , @entity133			0
testing on the inside of the tape was inconclusive , but a possible indication of dna there did not appear to match @entity2 , @entity2 or @entity9 , she said			1
outdoor elements such as sunshine and water can degrade dna , she said			0
also testifying thursday was @entity142 , a supervisor in the @entity144 forensics unit			0
@entity142 testified that a piece of cardboard with a heart - shaped sticker on it was found about 30 feet from where @entity2 's skull was discovered			1
an @entity16 technician previously testified that heart - shaped adhesive was seen on the duct tape covering the mouth portion of the remains			0
sheets of heart - shaped stickers have been introduced into evidence after being found at the @entity9 home , but @entity16 analysis showed that the sticker found near the remains did not match those taken from the home			2
@entity133 testified that she examined the duct tape for any heart - shaped sticker residue but was unable to see it , even using specialized tools			0
she said she had no idea how her @entity137 wound up on the duct tape			0
in @entity173 's @entity172 , @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report			0
watch @entity175 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity176			0
