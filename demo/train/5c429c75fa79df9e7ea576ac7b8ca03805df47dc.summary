@entity0 , @entity1 -- the human cost of the @entity1 conflict is escalating , with killings and attacks on children by the @entity9 and other insurgent groups soaring , the @entity3 said in a report released tuesday			1
" @entity1 children and women are increasingly bearing the brunt of this conflict , " says @entity12 , special representative of the @entity3 secretary - general			1
" they are being killed and injured in their homes and communities in greater numbers than ever before			0
" according to the @entity3 ' 2010 @entity20 in @entity21 , in the first six months of this year , 55 percent more children were killed or wounded by the @entity9 and other anti-government groups than in the same period in 2009			1
the number of women killed or wounded by the @entity9 and other insurgents increased by six percent			1
the report says casualties caused by pro-government forces , including the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) and @entity1 security forces , fell 30 percent in the first six months of 2010			1
from january 1 to june 30 , 2010 , the @entity32 documented a total of 3,268 civilian casualties , including 1,271 deaths and 1,997 injuries			0
anti-government forces were responsible for 2,477 casualties			2
that is 76 percent of all casualties , up 53 percent from 2009			0
pro-government forces were responsible for 386 civilian casualties , 12 percent of all casualties , down from 30 percent in 2009			1
the @entity3 notes two lethal developments : insurgents , it says , are using more improvised explosive devices ( @entity48 ) throughout the country and are assassinating and executing more civilians			2
ieds alone accounted for 29 percent of all civilian deaths in the period , including 74 children , a 155 - percent surge from the same span last year			0
assassinations and executions , meanwhile , soared by more than 95 percent and included the public executions of children			0
aerial attacks are the most harmful tactic used by @entity30 forces , causing 69 of the 223 civilian deaths attributed to pro-government forces in the first six months of 2010 -- a total of 31 percent -- and injuring 45 @entity1 civilians			1
however , civilian deaths caused by aerial attacks decreased 64 percent from the same period in 2009 , according to the report			2
the @entity3 says this reflects greater implementation of an @entity30 tactical directive from july 2009 on regulating the use of airstrikes and other measures to reduce civilian casualties			2
@entity30 , in a statement , said the new @entity3 report is consistent with figures tracked by @entity30 headquarters			1
it quoted gen. @entity82 's new tactical directive , in which he says , " we must continue our emphasis on reducing the loss of innocent civilian life to an absolute minimum			0
" every @entity1 death diminishes our cause			0
while we have made progress in our efforts to reduce coalition - caused civilian casualties , we know the measure by which our mission will be judged is protecting the population from harm by either side			0
we will redouble our efforts to prevent insurgents from harming their neighbors			0
