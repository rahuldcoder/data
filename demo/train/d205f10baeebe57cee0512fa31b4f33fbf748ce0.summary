-- i strongly believe being mayor is the public post in which you have the greatest opportunity to change peoples ' lives for the better			0
people live in cities , not states or nations			1
as a mayor , you are connected directly to citizens			0
and cities are increasingly the preferred place for most people to live			1
today , half of the world 's population is settled in urban areas			1
by 2050 , seven out of 10 people will live in cities , according to @entity23 projections			1
i like to say i have the best job in the world			2
@entity27 is an incredible place , a vibrant place , full of energy , culture and virtues			1
in the recent past , the city and its people seemed to be be headed down -- after 1960 , @entity27 was was no longer the capital of @entity36 and it faced economic difficulties and bad public management , which helped aggravate urban problems such as poverty and violence			1
watch @entity43 ' @entity42 but those days are over , and that 's symbolized by the fact that @entity27 will host the fist @entity46 in @entity47 in 2016			1
it was not easy to get there			0
our @entity46 bid had to be selected over strong candidates such as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
but the @entity56 found our proposal was the one that would leave the greatest legacy			0
with dedication , inspiration and professionalism we have shown that things can be done			0
@entity42 : @entity64 sings of the city running a city is a great challenge			0
but it turns out that you do n't have to be powerful or rich to be innovative and find good forms of urban development			2
i believe there are four basic commandments that serve as pillars for building a better city : commandment 1 -- a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly @entity27 is an energetic , vibrant place , full of beauty and nature			1
but we face the kinds of problems any developing metropolis does -- with pollution , traffic congestion , poverty			1
distribution of green areas , for example , is not uniform			0
@entity92 , the heart of the suburb in @entity27 , is a concrete jungle			1
you have to find open spaces and make it so people can get to them			1
we are building the third - largest park in the city in @entity104 , the temperature will drop 2 to 3 degrees centigrade			2
every time you think of a city you have to think green , green , green			0
commandment 2 -- a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration cities are packed with people			1
how can you move people around effectively ? high - capacity transportation usually requires a lot of money			2
a solution we found was @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , presented by a former mayor of @entity121 , @entity64			0
you transform a bus so that it functions virtually as a train car , with dedicated lanes and the same comfort and features as a subway station			1
a kilometer of @entity119 costs 10 times less than a subway and it gets built much faster			2
we will see the proportion of @entity27 's population served by high capacity transportation rise from 18 % today to 63 % by 2015			1
@entity42 : why the world needs charter cities commandment 3 -- a city of the future has to be socially integrated in @entity27 , 1.4 million of the 6.3 million people live in favelas , or slums			1
they are all over the city but favelas are not always a problem -- sometimes they can be a solution , if you have the right public policies			0
what you need is to change from a vicious circle to a virtuous circle : bring basic services inside the favelas with the same high quality you have in richer areas			0
the second aspect is to create open space in the favelas and develop infrastructure			0
by 2020 , @entity27 aims to have all its favelas completely urbanized			1
commandment 4 -- a city of the future has to use technology we use technology to be flexible			2
in @entity27 we built a @entity166 , a situation room that gathers information from municipal departments and allows us to manage and help decision - making			2
i can check the weather , the traffic and the location of city 's waste collection trucks			2
each of 4,000 buses in the city has a camera connected to the situation room			0
that help us manage emergencies and extreme situations			0
at the end of the day , when we talk about a city we are talking about a gathering of people			2
we can not see that as a problem			0
the city of the future is a place that cares about its citizens and brings them together .			0

@entity43 : more than half the world 's people now live in cities
@entity43 : cities must be environmentally friendly , must find answers to congestion , pollution
@entity27 is using " bus rapid transit " as an *alternative* to building costly subway lines , he says
he says cities must be integrated socially , must take *advantage* of technology
