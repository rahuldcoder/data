-- there was no mistaking the target : the eight huge cooling towers at @entity5 power station , sending plumes of steam high into the watery blue sky of the @entity9			1
a mix of peaceful protest and direct action took place at @entity5 , @entity14			1
instead the question in the minds of an estimated 1,000 protestors gathered in the surrounding woods and scrubland was how could they get in and shut it down			1
surrounded by electrified fences , coils of razor wire and hundreds of police , this coal - fired power station run by @entity24 energy firm @entity23 was the target of environmental activists campaigning to stop climate change			1
organizers of the protest , an amorphous group called the @entity35 , claim the plant is one of the @entity39 's largest sources of co2 emissions and had named last weekend 's protest , " @entity42 "			1
" climate change is one of the most important and urgent problems facing us , " one protestor called @entity44 , told @entity0			1
" our politicians are not doing enough			0
we have to take action			2
" " we need to increase the pressure on [ @entity39 prime minister ] @entity53 until he changes his mind about coal , " said another called @entity50			1
" i would n't be here if i thought we could n't make a difference today			2
" many protestors were upbeat following a recent decision by @entity23 to shelve plans for a new coal powered power station at @entity63 , in southern @entity14 , and the site of a similar protest in 2008			1
@entity23 told @entity0 that the decision was " purely economic " , and " due to a marked fall in demand for electricity during the recession " , although many activists were claiming it as a victory for them			2
determination to act there was no doubting the activists ' dedication			2
the weekend began peacefully enough with a procession snaking up from the @entity79 train station accompanied by a pedal - powered sound - system and a band			1
several officers told @entity0 they were glad to be policing this event rather than a local football derby on the same day			2
yet over 24 - hours police say 57 protestors were arrested and both police and activists were injured in violent scuffles			1
the protest at @entity5 was the latest from a movement that has quickly come to define environmental activism in @entity39 , mixing elements of the mid- 1990s road protest movement with the more targeted , professional approach of groups like @entity97 and the mass civil disobedience modeled by the @entity99			1
although leaderless and non-hierarchical it has shown determination , organization and direction			0
there were several families with young children at the protests , as well as individuals of all ages , although the bulk were twenty - and thirty - somethings			0
while some wore bandanas to hide their faces , others were in dressed as clowns or scarecrows and seemed content to picnic within sight of the plant			0
peaceful protest and police in the spring @entity123 a climate modeler for @entity125 and prominent scientist lent his support for direct action , telling @entity130 newspaper : " the democratic process does n't quite seem to be working ... i think that peaceful demonstration is not out of order , because we 're running out of time			1
" the first action by @entity137 was at @entity139 coal power station in 2006 , followed by @entity140 in 2007 and @entity63 coal power station in 2008			1
in 2009 there have already been three events : a protest at the @entity145 in @entity146 , to coincide with the @entity147 ; a camp on @entity149 , @entity146 , in august -- the site of the @entity151 - and now the protests at @entity153			2
all have been characterized by a mix of peaceful protest around a " camp " that is intended to model low - carbon living , alongside militant direct action - and an increasingly tense relationship with police			1
at @entity63 a huge police presence carried out over 8,000 searches according to an official report by the @entity165 , which also criticized tactics as " disproportionate and counterproductive "			0
the death of @entity168 after being pushed to the ground by an officer at the @entity147 protests this april led to a storm of criticism , and seems to have brought about some changes in police tactics -- arresting activists before they act , rather than confronting them in the field			2
last week ten people intending to come to @entity5 were held by police on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass , according to @entity182			0
others have claimed they were phoned and told they would be arrested if they came -- something the police deny			0
willing to be arrested some of the most dramatic scenes came on saturday afternoon came when hundreds of protestors mobbed around the perimeter fence on the north side of the plant and attempted to pull it down			2
ropes were attached to fence posts , with protestors clasping their hands over them as officers tried to cut the cords with knives and secateurs , as the crowd heaved down the fences			0
others climbed up and hung on -- including one man and his young daughter			0
it was in this moment that a division seemed to emerge between those ready to confront the police head on , and those holding back			0
above the few dozen actually at the fence were many more holding back , cheering , but wondering what to do , obviously frightened of being arrested			0
" come down ! " came the cry from one man at the fence			0
" this is not a spectator sport ! " but few did			0
while the movement prides itself on inclusivity , and commitment is welcome at any level , it clearly needs people ready to be arrested			0
whether the weekend 's protests will inspire more of those who came to greater militancy next time around -- or scare them away - remains to be seen			0
but as dusk fell on saturday night and camp was set the protestors were claiming victory -- and the next target was already clear as they packed up tents and sleeping bags the next day after a chilly night under the stars , cell phones chirruped as a message arrived : " we did it ! 24 hrs of truly inspirational action ! fences down , gates blockaded , railway occupied , a camp in the woods			1
" now onwards to @entity250 ! "			0

@entity253 activists gathered at power station in @entity39 to protest against climate change
