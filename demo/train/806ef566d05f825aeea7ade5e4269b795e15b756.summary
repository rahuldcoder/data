for just a few ethereal minutes on the morning of november 14 , the nation 's northernmost tip will be plunged in to complete darkness , as the moon aligns precisely between the earth and the sun. @entity19 will certainly not be alone			1

for her part , @entity0 will be running in the @entity30 , a race that begins the moment the first shard of light emerges from behind the moon -- creating what the event organizers describe as an " intergalactic starting gun			2

with a large group , the anticipation leading up to the event is a big part of the fun , he says			2
" there 's a lot of excitement that builds up before the first moment when the moon kisses the sun. " and while " totality is probably the fastest few minutes you can probably live through , " the short duration does n't minimize the experience			2
" it 's a phenomenal thing to see , " he says			0
