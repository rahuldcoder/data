-- waking up tuesday to the news that my good friend and former team mate @entity2 was in a critical state in hospital after a blow to the head in a state cricket match made me instantly realize how fragile life can be			1
this is a bloke who lives life to the full			1
when we lived together in @entity15 and i was knocking around the flat -- getting stressed about something or the other -- it would be his arm around my shoulder , saying " you just got to enjoy it , bro " accompanied by a trademark grin			2
@entity2 is the type of guy you 'd expect to walk about with a surfboard under his arm , because he 's always looking for the next wave			1
a strong , energetic person , he has transformed much of my thinking about the game -- and even my life			1
my relationship with him started when i agreed to be the overseas player for the @entity38 cricket team in @entity39			1
@entity2 was the new young gun in @entity42 cricket who had burst onto the scene			1
we hit it off and i gained so much from this young guy who oozed such confidence			2
he seemed so fearless and full of life			1
he was carefree yet deeply focused and hungry ; i loved being around all that energy			2
it made me feel alive and it certainly brought me out of my own introspection			2
it contrasted starkly with the way i had gone about my career to that time			2
we made an odd couple			2
@entity2 was a breath of fresh air and it was only a few months later that we were sharing an apartment in @entity62 while he ripped up county cricket during his first stint playing for @entity65			1
i was in awe of this young kid -- five years my junior -- " what a player ! " i thought			1
so when i woke up in @entity71 to receive the news about his accident it sent a chill down my spine			0
i had spent the weekend watching @entity77 at the @entity78 charging towards his second world championship			0
frequently , during the weekend watching drivers careering around a track at incredible speeds , my elation at this high - octane sport was tinged with apprehension			1
my thoughts tracked back to the life of @entity88 , arguably the most naturally gifted racing driver of all - time			1
@entity88 was brave , a three - time world champion , but at the same fearful			1
he was deeply ambitious and individual			0
yet in a split second he was gone , losing his life after a crash at @entity92 in 1994			2
and then this happens to @entity2 -- left in a critical state			1
cricket is essentially a team sport but the life of a top order batsmen can be isolated and lonely			1
the hours spent hitting thousands of balls trying to perfect your game can drive you mad			2
on many occasions , you strap on your pads and go out to train despite feeling well outside of your comfort zone			0
pushing yourself to the limit , there is often more apprehension in training than there is in match play			0
then there is the lonely bubble under your helmet			0
just you and your thoughts			0
there is always the time to mull over your next move			0
being a batsmen is lonely , it takes drive and a courage to face your emotions and your fears			1
you are frequently tested by the best fast bowlers in the toughest circumstances			0
but it is n't often you face someone and are truly scared			2
i have faced 95 mph balls from a bowling machine off 18 yards in an indoor hall , with the lights turned off , and felt horrendous			0
it has become a regular occurrence in my life			2
this year , playing for @entity139 against @entity140 , i got a nasty crack to the head			1
i 've always prided myself on the way i play short pitch stuff but that day the angle of delivery , coupled with some foggy processing , did for me			0
i copped one flush on the side of my helmet			0
i recall , clearly , being shocked at how dazed i felt and i remember thinking " i could be in trouble			0
" i put my hands on my knees , and just waited for things to go dark around me			0
fortunately they did n't and , after lying on my back for a couple of minutes and taking on some refreshment , i was able to carry on			0
so seeing @entity2 fall flat on his face like that was spine chilling			1
@entity2 's accident was a complete freak			1
for a ball to miss everything and cause such harm to the head is desperately bad luck			2
granted , there has been a litany of incidents in recent times where the ball has found a way through the grill of the helmet bruising cheeks and noses , cutting the skin or removing teeth			0
but for a ball to almost find its way through , under the helmet , behind the ear , and to cause that sort of damage is unheard of			0
@entity2 mistimed his shot , was through it too late -- it happens to all of us -- and then got himself into a bit of a tangle			1
ninety nine times out of 100 , he would simply have been shaken and down on his haunches for a few seconds , before dusting himself off and carrying on			0
maybe even hit the next short ball for six			0
this injury has left everyone in the cricketing world stunned			0
our thoughts are with @entity2 and his family			1
i feel desperate thinking of everyone -- the love and adoration for him is overwhelming to see			0
right now i am thinking of him , that surfboard under his arm , taking on " ours " -- the notorious surfing break located in the @entity209 , @entity210			0
and if anyone can ride this wave , it is @entity2 .			1
