-- anything you can do , i can do better			0
that was the message from @entity5 to @entity7 's boy wonder @entity8			2
both players , teammates at @entity10 , have lit up this @entity11 with four goals in their opening three games			0
but unlike @entity8 , who at the age of just 22 has scored 35 goals in 52 international appearances , @entity5 has had to contend with critics who say he never delivers when playing in an @entity20 shirt			1
now , having scored more times in this tournament than his previous two @entity24 combined , those opinions appear to have disappeared ahead of the last - 16 tie against @entity26			0
two goals against @entity28 in wednesday 's 3 - 2 victory secured top spot in @entity31 against a @entity28 side which qualified for the last 16 in second place courtesy of @entity35 's 3 - 1 defeat by @entity36			1
" @entity5 is one heck of a player , " @entity28 coach @entity37 told reporters			1
" you ca n't take that away from him			0
i think there are other players in the @entity20 squad who are very strong , but @entity5 is from @entity46			1
" we gave too much respect to the @entity48 and did not play our game in the first half			0
we played a bit more aggressive in the second half			0
congratulations to the @entity20 team , i wish them all the best in the tournament			2
" @entity5 left @entity20 for @entity57 at the age of 13 -- a move which led many in his homeland to question whether he had taken on a @entity63 identity by the time he grew into one of the world 's greats			1
surely that myth will be extinguished should @entity5 lead his country to its first @entity11 triumph since 1986 -- and the signs are increasingly encouraging			2
he has now scored 42 goals in 88 international appearances while playing with an energy which suggests he may have been saving his best for last following a relatively poor season at @entity10 , which was interrupted by injury			0
his last - gasp goal which secured a 1 - 0 win over a valiant @entity35 was a moment of magic which will long be remembered			1
that goal , which came just moments after @entity82 -- arguably @entity20 's greatest ever player -- had left the stadium , appeared to signal his arrival as the nation 's new hero			2
@entity5 , who turned 27 on tuesday , said his perfect birthday gift would be to win the @entity11 -- and given his recent performances , it would take a brave person to bet against it			2
unlike on saturday against @entity35 , @entity5 required just three minutes to unpick the @entity93 defense in @entity94			1
a sumptuous through ball by @entity96 released @entity97 and , when his shot was pushed onto the post by the @entity28 goalkeeper , @entity5 followed up to lash the ball high into the net			1
@entity28 , which had n't conceded a goal in its previous two games , could scarcely have reacted better			2
just over a minute later , a quick break allowed @entity106 to find space on the left before he cut inside a curled home a delightful effort past the outstretched arm of @entity112			0
a draw would have been enough to take @entity28 through to the next stage for the first time since 1998 but the @entity116 struggled to contain a rampant looking @entity20			1
@entity97 , a star of @entity119 's @entity118 triumph , unleashed a fierce 30 - yard drive which @entity121 , the @entity28 goalkeeper , did well to turn behind			2
@entity121 , who has enjoyed an impressive season with @entity124 club @entity123 , then denied @entity5 from 25 yards as the forward arrowed a free kick towards goal			0
but with the first half drawing to a close , he was beaten again as @entity5 curled home an exquisite effort from 20 yards with his wand - like left - foot			1
@entity28 could have been forgiven for beginning to fear the worst at the interval given @entity5 's moments of magic			1
but @entity37 's men appeared reinvigorated after the break and @entity106 broke through the @entity20 defense to level within two minutes of the restart			0
@entity28 , paired with @entity20 for the fourth time in the @entity11 , suffered narrow defeats in each of its previous three fixtures against the @entity142			1
but any thoughts that this would finally be its day were soon extinguished when @entity145 bundled in @entity5 's corner just three minutes later			0
the mercurial @entity5 , having already tormented @entity28 for just over an hour , was then substituted by coach @entity147 -- either to give him a rest or out of sympathy for his opponents			1
as @entity5 walked off to a standing ovation and an almighty roar from the thousands wearing blue and white packed inside the stadium , the game appeared to meander somewhat			0
there was still time for @entity106 to threaten a hat - trick while @entity5 's replacement , @entity159 , should have done better with a headed chance late on			2
but with the news of @entity35 's demise filtering through from @entity163 , @entity28 appeared aware of its qualification and a showdown with @entity166 in @entity167 on monday			1
@entity35 , which fought so valiantly during the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity20 last saturday , required a victory to progress for the first time in its history , combined with a @entity93 defeat			1
but it was frustrated in its attempt by a @entity36 team , which despite already being unable to qualify for the knockout phase , appeared determined to go out of its first @entity11 in style			0
@entity36 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity28 , which riled coach @entity181 after his team wrongly had a goal disallowed , left several players inconsolable at the final whistle			1
but there was little sign of a hangover and @entity189 , the man whose effort was ruled out , finally gained the goal he so badly craved when he drove home from 20 yards			0
@entity194 's @entity193 added a second after the break before @entity197 pulled one back with 11 minutes remaining			0
but with @entity35 pushing forward for an equalizer , @entity198 rounded off a rapid move by firing in off the post to secure his country 's historic first @entity11 victory			0

@entity5 scores twice for @entity20
@entity28 qualifies despite 3 - 2 defeat
@entity35 beaten 3 - 1 by @entity36
@entity189 and @entity193 on target for @entity36
