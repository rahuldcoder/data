@entity0 -- several observers on the left side of the opinion spectrum write dismissively of the followers of the @entity6			1
about the kindest labels appended to them are " rednecks , " " highly volatile " and " laughable			0
" young research assistants at @entity10 see them as " psychopaths , " " racists , " " anti-semites " and " homophobes " and hold that , in the political arena , " one can not talk to them ; one must defeat them			0
" as i see it , it is never a good idea to dismiss out of hand a major social movement			1
one poll in december found the tea party movement was then viewed favorably by more @entity28 ( 41 percent ) than either the @entity29 ( 35 percent ) or the @entity30 ( 28 percent )			1
more importantly , the concern on the part of tea partiers that the government is not responsive to the interests and values of the majority is a valid one			1
whether the bank and auto industry bailouts , the huge economic stimulus package and the health care bill are good policies or bad -- and will help the economy or hurt it -- they are not favored by the majority of @entity28			1
and the things that people most care about -- the creation of new jobs and vigorous economic growth -- are lacking			0
even more important are the ways the bills were fashioned			0
there is a saying in @entity0 that one should never see the ways laws and sausages are made			1
well , many people are choking on them even without knowing how they were concocted			0
those of us who follow politics closely have become inured to the fact that the bills that are finally enacted ( often after months of haggling , slicing and dicing ) are loaded with earmarks that favor some congressional districts or industry and are riddled with exceptions for special interests			2
you may not wonder why the auto dealers won exemptions in @entity71 from the new financial regulations			0
but the behind - the - scene deals the @entity74 has made are enough to make you sick			2
these include deals with private hospitals to drop the public option in exchange for their support of the health care bill and with the pharmaceutical industry to block @entity28 from purchasing low - cost drugs from other countries			2
some of us have learned to live with these maneuvers as long as something comes out at the other end			0
however , many @entity28 are busy working or looking for a job , taking care of their families and trying to find some spare time to follow their favorite sports team and have a beer			0
but when they are made aware of these shenanigans , they are nauseated			0
i choose my words carefully			0
i suggest that the sense of the tea partiers that they have been had is largely a valid one			2
at the same time , their ideas of what ought to be done are very much off the mark			0
the desire to gut the government ignores the fact that there are many important missions that the government is best - suited to accomplish			2
however , before those of us who do not belong to this movement can carry this message to the tea partiers , we first need to validate their feelings , rather than dismiss them			1
and we must be honest : reforming the government so that it will be less captured by special interests and more responsive to the public interest is a difficult road to navigate			1
indeed , that road was recently made more difficult to navigate by a @entity125 ruling that largely lifted the limits on legalized bribery , which is the proper name for allowing corporations and labor unions to make unfettered donations to the political campaigns of those who do their bidding			0
the best we can offer is to point out that a major , populist social movement can serve to countervail special interests , as long as it sees its role as to straighten out the government , rather than to decimate it			1
this is what the progressive movement of yore accomplished			2
however , we can not have this very badly needed dialogue with the followers of the tea party unless we make it clear that we understand where they are coming from			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			1

@entity150 : tea party *correct* that government not responsive to majority
he says they are right to be disgusted by @entity0 deals that grant special favors
he says tea party movement is wrong about the *solution*
