@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 capt. @entity3 was half a world away from his home and his family in @entity0 on june 26 , when he received a text message from his wife : it was an image of a house on fire with the words , " this is our home			1
" " i could identify the house because of my car , which was in the driveway , " he said			2
both @entity3 and his wife , @entity19 , had been following the news of the @entity21 , which had started three days earlier , but neither was aware of their home 's fate until they saw that photo , which had been splashed across the front page of the @entity27			1
from his post in the @entity29 , @entity3 was n't even aware that his family 's home was in danger of being consumed by the wildfire			1
just hours before sending that text , @entity34 had scrambled the couple 's three kids into a car and rushed to a friend 's house , abandoning plans to celebrate their son @entity42 's 10th birthday			1
" we had picked up the cake			2
we were just preparing for a birthday evening , " she said			2
amid the last - minute birthday preparations , @entity19 continually checked local news reports about the progress of the massive fire as it bore down on @entity0			1
at that time , the blaze had forced the evacuation of 11,000 people ( that number would later triple ) , threatening 13,000 homes , and none of the fire had been contained			0
" i was watching the news and i would run outside and look at the plume , " she said			0
as the sky grew darker and more ominous , @entity19 knew time was running out			0
" when i looked up and saw the flames coming over the ridge is when i knew it was possibly very serious , " she said			0
" i just said , ' we need to get out of here			0
' " @entity67 share their harrowing views of the wildfires she knew she made the right decision hours later , when she saw the @entity27 's front page			1
she immediately sent the image to her husband , who showed the photo to his superiors			1
" the first thing they said was ' you need to go home , ' " he said			1
" i was on the next flight out			0
" as he boarded a flight home , @entity3 stayed in touch with his wife , keeping tabs on the situation without telling her that he was homeward bound			1
a day later , he arrived at the home where his wife and three children were staying			1
" i knocked on the door and i believe my daughter @entity92 opened the door first and she just stepped back for a moment , " he said			0
" she did n't know how to react , but after a few seconds she was just all over me			0
" the emotional pendulum swung from the despair to " elation , " @entity19 said			0
" there was a ring at the door bell and there he was , " she said , still beaming at the memory			0
" i felt so relieved			0
" " this was n't something my wife could do alone , " @entity3 said			1
" i definitely needed to be there for support			0
also , the kids , they needed a father figure around			0
" the @entity21 charred more than 18,000 acres and destroyed 346 homes , making it the most destructive in the state 's history			1
at the height of the fire , 32,000 @entity1 residents evacuated their homes			2

the couple 's three children -- @entity42 , 10 , @entity130 , 5 , and @entity92 , 2 -- splash around in the hotel pool while @entity19 and @entity3 talk about their hope for the family 's future			1
" we just feel compelled to rebuild there , " @entity19 said of the lot where their home once stood			2
" after 15 years of being together , we 've weathered a lot of storms together and we just know how to get through things together , " @entity3 said , putting his arm around his wife			1
