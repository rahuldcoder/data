editor 's note : @entity2 is the @entity3 at the @entity4 and director of the university 's @entity6			1
he is the editor of " @entity8 : @entity12 and the @entity13 , " and is a member of the board of the @entity11			0
@entity2 says @entity15 's nomination affirms that @entity16 matter in @entity17			1
( @entity18 ) -- i recently saw an old episode of " @entity21 , " where @entity22 , playing a fictional @entity24 federal judge , was nominated to become the first @entity25 on the @entity17 @entity26			1
i cried , thinking how remote this possibility seemed , yet how close			0
now that judge @entity15 has been nominated by president @entity29 to the @entity26 , that episode finally rings true			1
when i heard the news , i wept , for the long - overdue acknowledgement that @entity16 matter			2
judge @entity15 's life and legal career are arcs possible only in this country : a hardscrabble life in a south @entity38 housing project , educational opportunities made possible by her own intelligence and hard work , and a legal career devoted to public service			1
when she assumes her position on the bench in october , no other justice will have had the depth of legal experience she holds , and none will have served as a trial judge			0
the sum of her life is exactly what we should look for on this court : excellent academic credentials , an accomplished legal career in private and government practice , and appointments to federal benches by @entity63 and @entity64 presidents			0
her decisions have been well - reasoned and well - written , and she will ably take her place on the @entity26 bench			0
the search for a justice with " empathy " is no less coded than is the traditional search for " judicial temperament " and a person who will " judge , not legislate			0
" all nominees have the requisite merit badges , as does @entity15			2
and to make their way to such a short list , all have the combination of personal and professional lives that warrant their consideration			2
what @entity15 will have , as few other candidates , is the additional weight of historical expectations and the hopes of @entity16			1
in today 's culture , @entity16 are marginalized and demonized and feared			1
in @entity15 's @entity92 , roving gangs of thugs go " beaner hunting , " looking to harm undocumented @entity93			1
such racial hatred knows no nuance , as one such mob killed a permanent resident @entity98 , thinking him to be @entity93			0
vigilantes along the @entity93 border have taken the law of enforcement into their own hands			0
in cultural programming , this community is described as either lazy and shiftless , or stealing jobs from real @entity17			2
they are typecast as drogeros or maids , long characterized as banditos or greasers			0
the racial rhetoric against @entity16 has been tolerated for too long on cable television news and in political and polite discourse			2
i will be carefully watching the confirmation hearings for the coded political messages , knowing that justice - elect @entity15 's many merits will ultimately win her confirmation			1
but also watching will be little girls in a south @entity38 housing project , in the valley of @entity123 , and in rural @entity124			0
her service on our country 's highest court will be the evidence that they , too , have reason to hope and to achieve			2
all of this country 's citizens should realize that it is not just @entity16 ' dreams being realized , but our collective accomplishment			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0
