it should be a match made in heaven			2
but in the last decade the " @entity8 " has n't prospered in the blustery environs of @entity5 on the @entity6 in @entity7			1
since 1991 , @entity9 has played 10 times at the @entity11 , and not made the cut once			2
thursday saw one of golf 's most colorful -- quite literally -- characters tame the conditions , however , to shoot an impressive opening round of 65			1
the 48 - year - old has had well documented battles with alcohol and gambling during his career but showed he can still mix it with the best with a combination of big hitting and short game prowess			1
@entity9 , a two - time major champion , carded seven birdies in a bogey - free round to sit one off the lead , held by fellow @entity32 @entity31 and @entity33			1
it was his best opening round since 2005			1
" it 's been a long time since i played that well in the first round of this tournament , " @entity9 told the @entity36 's official website			1
" i still feel like i got somewhat of the length to play somewhat long golf courses			0
not like some of the guys , but i just hit it in good positions and i left myself those six or seven pins that were back that i left myself good uphill putts			0
" i had about four or five gim me birdies -- that always helps too			0
did n't knock any over the green			0
" @entity9 is renowned for his colorful attire and is usually accompanied on the course by his caddie -- girlfriend @entity53 , who also dresses accordingly			1
he has long been a popular player on the @entity36 , partly due to his hitting prowess -- he was the first man to average over 300 yards per drive over the course of a full season in 1997			0
but he also gained fans for being the antithesis of the traditional golfer with his flowing locks , alternative dress sense and , at times , controversial private life			2
he has twice been banned by the @entity36 , once for six months in 2008 when he was found drunk outside a restaurant in @entity65 and spent a night in jail			0
@entity9 's breakthrough came at the 1991 @entity68			1
@entity9 only got in as a ninth alternate and went on to win by three shots to claim his first @entity36 title			2
he followed that up with the 1995 @entity73 , defeating @entity74 after the @entity75 had holed a miraculous 60 - foot putt on the final hole to force a playoff			1
@entity9 has only two top 10 finishes to his name since 2006 and last came close to winning a title when he was beaten by 14 - time major champion @entity82 in a playoff at a @entity85 event			1
he is playing the pro-am with @entity87 , a former @entity88 star who went on to coach the @entity89 and @entity90 , and he was full of praise for his partner 's upbeat attitude			0
" he 's just the most positive human being in the world , " @entity9 said			2
" no matter what happens , everything 's positive			0
me and ( fellow player ) @entity98 were talking about it			0
we would like to go see him speak somewhere , just to get fired up			0
