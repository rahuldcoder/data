@entity0 -- president @entity2 said monday his $ 447 billion jobs plan is a common - sense approach needed right away , but @entity7 @entity6 leaders said they opposed @entity2 's intention to pay for it by ending tax relief for corporations and the wealthy			1
in a message accompanying the legislation he sent to @entity13 on monday afternoon , @entity2 said his proposal " is fully paid for			2
" " the legislation includes specific offsets to close corporate tax loopholes and asks the wealthiest @entity18 to pay their fair share that more than cover the cost of the jobs measures , " @entity2 's message said			1
in addition , he said , the package increases the target figure of a special joint congressional committee working on deficit reduction by the amount his plan would cost			1
if the committee reaches the higher target in deficit - reduction measures , then the offsets in his legislation that cover the cost of the plan would be unnecessary and therefore eliminated			1
however , house speaker @entity38 's spokesman said the @entity7 's proposal on how to pay for the measure was unacceptable			1
" it would be fair to say this tax increase on job creators is the kind of proposal both parties have opposed in the past , " @entity41 said in a written statement			2
@entity7 majority leader @entity49 echoed that stance , telling reporters : " i sure hope that the president is not suggesting that we pay for his proposals with a massive tax increase at the end of 2012 on the job creators that we 're actually counting on to reduce unemployment			1
" the @entity2 plan is part of the president 's effort to resurrect a comprehensive deficit reduction deal with @entity6 that would include reforms of the tax code and entitlement programs such as @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 to accompany government spending cuts			1
with $ 900 billion in spending cuts already enacted , the special joint deficit committee created under last month 's debt ceiling agreement has started work on finding another $ 1.5 trillion in deficit reduction steps that @entity13 can pass by the end of the year			1
in the meantime , @entity2 is pushing his jobs plan as a package of immediate steps that can spur economic growth and job creation			1
" this is a bill that will put people back to work all across the country , " @entity2 told a crowd of teachers , veterans , small - business owners and others at the @entity7			1
" this is a bill that will help our economy in a moment of national crisis			0
this is a bill that is based on ideas from both @entity101 and @entity6 , and this is the bill that @entity13 needs to pass			0
" with his poll numbers down as his campaign for re-election next year is beginning , @entity2 noted that " there are some in @entity0 who would rather settle our differences through politics and the elections than try to resolve them now			2
" but the " fact of the matter is the next election is 14 months away -- the @entity18 people do n't have the luxury of waiting 14 months for @entity13 to take action , " the president said			0
@entity2 made his pitch in the @entity121 hours before sending the legislation to @entity123 , where it received a polite but mixed reception			2
@entity38 , @entity126 , released a statement immediately after @entity2 's remarks , promising prompt consideration of the proposal			1
at the same time , however , @entity38 took a swipe at the 2009 economic stimulus plan backed by the administration			2
" the record of the economic proposals enacted during the last @entity13 necessitates careful examination of the president 's latest plan as well as consideration of alternative measures that may more effectively support private - sector job creation , " @entity38 said			1
" it is my hope that we will be able to work together to put in place the best ideas of both parties and help put @entity18 back to work			0
" @entity2 has been touting the virtue of his plan on the road , stopping in @entity152 last friday and heading to @entity153 and @entity154 later this week			2
among other things , @entity2 's plan would extend and expand the current payroll tax cut -- a proposal estimated to reduce revenues by $ 240 billion			1
the current cut , which has cost $ 112 billion so far , allows employees to pay 4.2 % instead of 6.2 % on their first $ 106,800 of wages into @entity67			0
@entity2 wants to continue the break -- now set to expire at the end of the year -- while reducing employee contributions further , to 3.1 %			2
at the same time , the president wants to halve the payroll tax that businesses pay -- to 3.1 % -- on the first $ 5 million in wages			2
@entity2 's proposal also includes a new $ 49 billion extension of unemployment benefits , which were lengthened to the current 99 - week maximum in 2009			2
top @entity101 argue that that money would immediately be pumped back into the economy in the form of new consumer spending			0
nearly 43 % of @entity18 's unemployed have now been out of work for more than six months			0
in addition , the plan proposes $ 60 billion for infrastructure development such as repairing roads and bridges , including the establishment of an infrastructure bank to help finance such projects			0
it is unclear whether the @entity188 -- consisting largely of targeted tax cuts , infrastructure spending and new job training assistance -- can win over enough skeptical congressional @entity6 , particularly in light of @entity2 's falling approval ratings and the looming presidential campaign			1
@entity49 , @entity152 , made clear he opposed new infrastructure spending and some other aspects of the @entity2 plan			2
" anything that is akin to the stimulus bill is not going to be acceptable to the @entity18 people , " @entity49 said , arguing that the 2009 stimulus that aimed money at boosting public sector jobs did n't work			0
instead , the @entity6 wants to target aid to small businesses , he said			0
" the fact is we do n't have the money and we 've got to prioritize , and right now it 's about getting people back to work , " @entity49 said			0
@entity49 cited tax credits for employers , reforming aid for the jobless , and passage of the three pending trade deals as areas of possible bipartisan agreement			0
while he agreed that infrastructure projects were worthy of focus , he said @entity13 should not be adding new money , but instead streamlining the process for getting current resources to state and local governments			0
" i do not think the president 's all - or - nothing approach is something that is constructive , " @entity49 said , adding , " let 's not allow the things his bill that we disagree with to get in the way of producing some results			1
" other provisions in the president 's proposal include $ 25 billion to refurbish schools , $ 35 billion to avoid layoffs among teachers and first responders , and tax incentives for small businesses to hire the long - term unemployed			1
under the @entity2 plan , businesses could receive a tax credit of up to $ 4,000 for hiring workers who have been out of a job for more than six months			1
to pay for the bill , new limits would be set on tax exemptions and itemized deductions for families making more than $ 250,000 annually			0
so - called " carried interest " for investment fund managers would be taxed as ordinary income , as opposed to the lower capital gains rate			0
additionally , a series of oil and gas industry tax loopholes would be closed , and depreciation rules would be changed for corporate jet owners			0
the total value of the changes , according to @entity264 director @entity263 , would be $ 467 billion -- approximately $ 20 billion more than the total cost of the plan			0
the special congressional deficit committee has until november 23 to approve more than $ 1.5 trillion in new deficit reduction steps , and @entity13 would then have to pass the plan -- unamended -- by december 23			1
if that does n't happen , more than $ 1 trillion in automatic across - the - board spending cuts would go into effect , including funding for the military , under a so - called trigger mechanism intended to motivate legislators to reach a deal			0
@entity1 's @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			0
