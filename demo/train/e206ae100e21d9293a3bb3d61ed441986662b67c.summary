-- @entity1 died tuesday at the age of @entity3 and here 's why you should know his name : @entity1 transformed the game of baseball even though he never put on a uniform			1
this slight union lawyer was considered the enemy of owners , and yet he might have done more than anyone else to bring free market competition to the national pastime and make it a modern big business			1
he was lionized and vilified and is sadly still denied entry into the @entity19			2
@entity19 combines sports and statistics , so consider these numbers when assessing the career of @entity1			1
when the @entity27 - born mustachioed man was named executive director of the @entity29 in 1966 , the average player 's salary was just $ 7,000 a year			1
many professional players had to work a second job just to provide for their families			0
in 1984 , when @entity1 left the position , the average players ' salary was $ 329,000			1
today it is $ 3.4 million			0
the reason is free agency			0
and that was the innovation that @entity1 brought to the game , against the bitter opposition of team owners			1
bizarre as it might sound today , 40 years ago baseball was exempt from antitrust legislation			0
one of the impacts was that players could be contractually obligated to work for one team in perpetuity through what was called the reserve clause			0
they were effectively denied the ability to test their value in the open market , something @entity1 saw as akin to slavery			1
in 1969 , he and a courageous @entity60 ' player named @entity61 , later christened " @entity63 in spikes " by columnist @entity62 , took their challenge to the reserve clause all the way to the @entity68 , where they lost by a 5 to 3 decision in 1972			0
but @entity1 persevered and pursued the players ' liberation of their capital through free agency in 1975			1
this survived a series of court challenges and became the norm today			0
yes , players are now paid sometimes absurd salaries , but fans come to see players , not owners , and they deserve their share of the profits as a result			0
yes , fans are too often denied their game by selfish strikes perpetrated by players and owners alike			0
these are unwelcome side effects of @entity1 's legacy			2
but the free agency era of increased competition has actually chipped away at monopolies in every sense			2
dynasties are less frequent and more teams have climbed from the cellar to the @entity100			0
the fact that @entity1 was denied entry into the @entity19 as recently as 2010 speaks to the influence of owners and their deep dislike of @entity1 's intrusions and innovations			1
but there is irony that the trust - buster actually helped grow the economic pie of baseball , making more players and owners wealthy			2
it was ultimately a win - win , though the owners would always have a hard time seeing it			0
the most eloquent tribute to @entity1 might have been his extended inclusion in the documentary " baseball " by @entity121 , one of my favorite movies			2
but the real tribute is all around us ; in countless ways the national pastime has been transformed through the efforts of a man whose name you might not have heard before tuesday night : @entity1 , @entity132 the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			1

@entity135 : @entity1 , who died tuesday , brought free market competition to baseball
@entity135 : when @entity1 became head of players ' union , the average player 's salary was $ 7,000
@entity135 : players could *n't* leave teams , which @entity1 *fought* , calling it a form of slavery
@entity135 : he made it possible for players to be free agents , but he never got in the @entity19
