the @entity1 also named @entity3 as a " primary money laundering concern			1
" @entity15 said she expects additional sanctions by other international partners and that taken together " these measures represent a significant ratcheting up of pressure on @entity3 , its sources of income and its illegal activities			2
" @entity4 cut all financial ties with @entity3 , the first time it has cut an entire country 's banking sector off from @entity4 finance , the @entity25 announced earlier on monday			1

the moves come days after an @entity38 report highlighted new concerns about " the possible military dimensions of @entity3 's nuclear program , " the @entity25 statement said monday			2
@entity3 says its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the @entity45 watchdog 's report " unbalanced " and " politically motivated			2
" " the @entity38 's report last week provided further credible and detailed evidence about the possible military dimensions of the @entity3 nuclear program , " @entity4 foreign secretary @entity46 said in a statement			1
" today we have responded resolutely by introducing a set of new sanctions that prohibit all business with @entity3 banks			1
" @entity5 foreign affairs minister @entity56 also cited the recent @entity38 report as " yet more proof that the current regime in @entity60 poses the most significant threats to global peace and security today			0
" " @entity5 is implementing , as of right now , a series of even tougher measures under the @entity66			0
these expanded sanctions prohibit almost all financial transactions with the @entity3 government , add individuals and entities to the list of designated persons and expand the list of prohibited goods , " he said in a statement			1
also monday @entity79 president @entity78 sent a letter to various leaders and heads of state , urging " new sanctions of unprecedented magnitude to convince @entity3 that it must negotiate , " according to a statement			2
@entity79 recommended that the @entity86 and its member states , as well as the @entity1 , @entity88 , @entity5 and other willing countries , freeze the asset of @entity3 's @entity91 and suspend purchases of @entity3 oil			1
@entity3 's nuclear program , the @entity79 president said , risks nuclear proliferation and " could spark a military escalation in the region with catastrophic consequences for @entity3 and for the world			2

following monday 's announcement , senior officials with the @entity138 spoke to reporters on a conference call , stressing the decision to designate an entire jurisdiction , like @entity3 , as a " primary money laundering concern " is rare			1
