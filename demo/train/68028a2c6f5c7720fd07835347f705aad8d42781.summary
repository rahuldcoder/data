@entity0 , @entity1 -- exactly 10 years ago , a brutal civil war was being fought in @entity1 as rebels advanced on the @entity5 in the capital , @entity0			1
from the former five - star @entity8 -- a luxury hotel without tvs which were banned by the @entity5 -- we watched as the rebels launched a daring raid on the airport			1
we could see the rockets flying in and flames coming from the fuel dumps and damaged aircraft			0
a few hours later we heard about the attacks in the @entity20			0
the @entity8 was where we watched the civil war , and where we were on 9/11 though the tv ban meant bizarrely we could not watch those events , and it was where the @entity5 foreign minister denied @entity29 's involvement			1
this year it came under attack from the @entity5			1
it 's in the heart of @entity0 and could symbolize the fragility of progress			1
a few months ago the @entity5 were able to storm the @entity8 and put up a three - hour gun battle that eventually involved @entity35 coming in to quell			1
that 's part of the story here			2
there 's the appearance of security but the @entity5 can mount complex attacks			1
the security we see is a veneer and that 's in the capital			1
meanwhile the rest of the country is open to violence and @entity5 intimidation			1
in @entity0 now , you can walk the streets but you ca n't set a pattern without opening up the risk of kidnap			1
for @entity1 , the city is relatively safe			0
people blame the police for a lot of bribery at the various checkpoints			0
but the city has improved			0
it 's much greener because the irrigation systems have been repaired and that makes the city look and feel brighter			2
under the @entity5 so much had been destroyed and it was always dusty			1
now there are new hotels being built and lots of brand new glass in the windows			0
the city looks and feels much better than it did but that does not make the place secure and right now the city is on very , very high alert			0
there are more checkpoints and the searches are much more thorough			0
everyone is aware the @entity5 can launch complex attacks , like the one on the @entity8 , and the anniversary of 9/11 would be a prime time for them			1
any moment when they can launch an attack that makes them look bigger or stronger than they are , they will exploit because of the worldwide headlines it would generate			2
the thing about being in @entity0 on 9/11 is we could not see any of the images because the @entity5 had banned tv			1
we could only visualize it through what others were telling us			0
i was on the phone to my wife when the second plane hit the @entity103 and at that moment i knew it was terrorism and most likely @entity29			0
he was the only one launching these ' spectacular ' attacks against the @entity20 that we had seen previously with the @entity106 and the embassies in @entity108 and @entity109			0
back then , eventually the @entity5 said it was not safe for us			1
under @entity1 culture when they invite you into the country they protect you			2
this was their way of saying we needed to leave			0
it was only when we were kicked out of the country about 10 days later that i got to see the damage from 9 / 11 for the first time			2
one of the hardest lessons over the past decade is the failure of the international community to step up			1
it 's frustrating that the window of opportunity that was there at the beginning was missed -- when all the @entity1 wanted was weapons and warlords to be removed and disarmed so that they could have a normal life			2
but the commitment that the international community gave was only sufficient only for its own needs - enough troops only to chase out @entity135 -- and did not address the fundamental problem of @entity1			1
then the humanitarian money over the following years did not measure up to the task and the @entity5 took advantage of that and exploited it			1
it 's also frustrating to realize -- without trying to heap all the blame on one person -- the failings or weaknesses of president @entity146 have limited what can be achieved in the country			1
when i first interviewed him he said the right things -- he wanted peace and stability for the whole country -- but he has failed to deliver , ran a corrupt regime and been accused by many of lying			2
one of the big political issues now is to get agreement on the number of @entity20 forces that can be based in @entity1			0
that will set in stone the future relationship between the two countries			0
i do n't think anyone expects good security in the near - term			0
there are no quick fix solutions to the fight with the @entity5			2
there is a sense among @entity174 officials that the @entity5 is getting worn down and worn out but that is not what the @entity5 says			2
they say they are ready to fight until the occupying force , @entity35 , leaves the country			0
the scene is being set for a continuation of what we have already seen and as coalition forces draw down the @entity5 will take any advantage			2
on a personal level when there were the 7/7 attacks in @entity187 2005 i was in the @entity20 and it made me very concerned about my family and i felt the same in the immediate aftermath of 9/11			0
i spend a lot of time examining the @entity135 threat , and while i am happy that i put it in perspective and do n't overblow it in my own my mind , i am very aware of what that threat could be			0
so if there is a heightened threat warning i would advise my friends and family to be cautious .			0

the @entity8 has *entertained* *diplomats* and come under @entity5 attack
one of the hardest lessons of the past decade is the failure of the international community to step up
president @entity146 's weaknesses have also limited what can be achieved in the country
@entity0 *enjoys* a veneer of security but the rest of the country is open to @entity5 violence
