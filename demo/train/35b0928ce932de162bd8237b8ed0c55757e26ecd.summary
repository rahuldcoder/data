the @entity0 and its allies are working to stop what they regard as an ominous trend : attacks against @entity7 - led troops by @entity9 security forces or others clad in military or police uniforms			1
the assaults , called green - on - blue or insider attacks , have spiked this year , causing the deaths of 39 @entity17 troops -- including two in @entity20 province friday			2
an estimated 101 @entity7 troops have been killed in green - on - blue attacks since may 2007 across @entity9 , military analyst @entity21 said friday			2
@entity21 , managing editor of the @entity25 blog , which reports and analyzes terror issues , said green - on - blue attacks have caused around 13 % of coalition deaths this year			1
of the green - on - blue attacks since 2007 , about 40 % of the deaths have occurred this year and 35 % occurred last year , @entity21 said			2
more @entity0 soldiers killed amid @entity32 claim of infiltrating @entity9 forces @entity0 defense secretary @entity34 said he is concerned that the attacks will damage coalition and @entity9 partnership efforts			1
speaking at a @entity39 news conference tuesday , he discussed measures to stop the acts by improving intelligence and vetting of security force recruits			2
" our enemies have attempted to undermine the trust between the coalition and @entity9 forces , and in particular they have tried to take credit for a number of so - called green - on - blue or insider attacks that have taken place this fighting season , " he said			1
" make no mistake about it			0
i 'm very concerned about these incidents			0
" one measure to combat the attackers is a " guardian angel program , " @entity34 said			1
that " involves identifying one individual who stands to the side so that he can watch people 's backs and hopefully identify people that would be involved in those attacks , " he said			2
@entity39 changing lingo to ' green - on - blue ' in growing threat @entity34 cited increasing " the intelligence presence " to obtain " better information with regards to these kinds of potential attacks			2
" he also mentioned increasing the counterintelligence presence to " identify those threats			2
" for example , a @entity7 official quoted in a column co-authored by @entity80 national security analyst @entity79 said that the increase of counterintelligence officers is designed to " ferret out @entity32 double agents			1
" @entity34 also said the military is using and reviewing a " thorough " and " eight - step " vetting process			1
" we 're doing forensics on the particular instances that occur in order to make sure , you know , how that process -- that vetting process operated and what we can do to improve it , " he said			1
another measure to fight the attacks is " implementing a notification process " for alerting people to threats			1
and another is that all troops at @entity7 headquarters in @entity102 now must carry loaded weapons around the clock , @entity80 has learned			0
@entity34 said gen @entity105 , the chief @entity7 commander in @entity9 , is meeting with village elders to discuss the issue			0
village elders " are the people who usually vouch for individuals			0
they have to sign something that vouches for the character of individuals , and he 's going back to them to ensure that that 's being done properly			0
" " all of this requires action both by the @entity0 and coalition forces and by our @entity9 partners who also face this insider threat			1
we should n't forget that the @entity9 themselves are targets of these kinds of attacks , as well , " he said			2
gen. @entity127 , chairman of the @entity128 , appeared at the news conference with @entity34			0
@entity105 is convening a conference of senior coalition commanders , and @entity9 security ministers are having a summit on the issue , @entity127 said			2
he stressed that @entity9 security forces are also suffering from the same trend and noted that president @entity137 has condemned the attacks			1
he cited an instance where @entity9 soldiers who were killed when they came to the aid of their @entity0 counterparts in one of the attacks			2
official : man in @entity9 security uniform kills 3 @entity0 troops " there 's far more stories about the positive relationship than there is about this particular insider attack trend , but it is one that we have to remain seized with and focused on , " he said			0
" unknown but important , they 've discharged hundreds of soldiers who did indicate ... that some of these young men had the capability to be radicalized , either by virtue of travel back and forth to @entity165 , by literature , by language , by music			0
" nevertheless , @entity32 leader @entity169 has claimed that fighters are infiltrating @entity9 security forces to attack @entity7 - led forces on their bases			1
" many @entity9 in the rank and files of the enemy have shown a willingness to help the ( @entity32 ) in a shrewd manner , " said a statement posted on militant websites thursday and obtained by @entity175 , which monitors the activities of militant groups on the @entity178			1
" as a result , the foreign invaders and their allies at their military centers and bases are suffering crushing blows by these heroic soldiers			0
" @entity34 said that " one of the reasons the @entity32 is targeting in this manner , we believe , is the success that our @entity9 partners are having on the battlefield			1
the reality is , the @entity32 has not been able to regain any territory lost , and so they 're resorting to these kinds of attacks to create havoc			1
" and , @entity34 said , there 's " no one source " for the attacks			0
some are people " who , for one reason or another , are upset and suddenly take it out			0
we 've seen that here in the @entity0 oftentimes			0
" sometimes , they are people who are n't @entity32 but become radicalized , he said			1
" they use cell phones to tune into various , you know , stations that provide incentives for that type of thing			0
and so we 've seen some of that take place in some of these attacks			0
and then others , you know , have some @entity32 ties , " @entity34 said			1
" it 's difficult to kind of draw any kind of firm conclusion as to just exactly , you know , whether this is kind of a pattern , a broad pattern			0
as a matter of fact , at least from everybody i 've talked to at this point , you know , these seem to be incidents that are taking place and oftentimes caused by different backgrounds of the individuals involved			0
" @entity79 , who wrote the column for @entity80 and the @entity245 with @entity246 , said the " motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to classify because the perpetrator is either dead or has fled			0
citing media accounts , @entity79 and @entity251 say many of the " green - on - blue " attacks appear to have occurred after quarrels between @entity9 and international troops , or because the @entity9 soldier has " personal grievances			1
" they cite a @entity39 report in april that said " investigations have determined that a large majority of green - on - blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the @entity264 [ @entity263 , ] but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel			1
" they said one military behavioral scientist who interviewed more than 600 @entity9 soldiers and policemen last year " found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of @entity271 soldiers			0
" " the @entity9 security forces aired grievances ranging from @entity7 soldiers ' supposedly indiscriminate fire that killed civilians to the public searching of @entity9 soldiers outside @entity7 bases , as well as @entity0 soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their @entity9 counterparts , " according to the authors			1
another cause of the increase in the attacks over the past two years is the growth of the @entity9 army and police force , @entity79 and @entity251 say			0
@entity9 police officer fires on @entity7 troops			0

the coalition has formed a " guardian angel " program
counterintelligence has been *bolstered* to *finger* @entity32 double agents
the forces are working to improve their recruit vetting process
analysts say " personal grievances " have caused many of the attacks
