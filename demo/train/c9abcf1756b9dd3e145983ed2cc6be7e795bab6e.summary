@entity0 -- in 1948 , a hospital outside @entity0 witnessed the birth of the @entity5 movement , as a @entity7 doctor who had fled @entity8 sought to change the lives of patients with spinal injuries -- and inspire new hope in them through sport			1
the first " @entity17 " were organized in 1948 to coincide with the @entity15 , the second to be held in @entity16			1
named for the hospital in @entity22 where prof. @entity24 's pioneering spinal injuries unit was based , the competitors in those initial games -- 14 men and two women -- took part in a wheelchair archery contest			1
many were military veterans injured on the battlefields of @entity29 just a year later , six teams competed at @entity31 -- with wheelchair netball , a forerunner of wheelchair basketball , being introduced -- as sport became a central part of a rehabilitation process that had been revolutionized by @entity24			1
in 1956 , a " statement of intent " was unveiled for the @entity17 , which were by this time international , according to to the @entity39 website run by the local authority			2
it read : " the aim of the @entity17 is to unite paralyzed men and women from all parts of the world in an international sports movement , and your spirit of true sportsmanship today will give hope and inspiration to thousands of paralyzed people			1
" four years later , inspired by @entity24 's vision , the first official @entity5 were held in @entity57 in tandem with the @entity15			2
and five decades on , some 4,280 paralympians from 165 countries -- the largest number ever -- have returned to @entity16 to compete in what is now the premier international sporting event for those born with disabilities , or disabled by injury or illness			1
in an echo of those first @entity17 , a number of those competing are military veterans , this time wounded in action in @entity73 and @entity74			1
blinded in @entity74 the @entity76 ' 227 - member 2012 @entity5 team includes 20 military veterans and active - duty service members , almost 10 % of the total			1
among them is navy lt. @entity81 , blinded last september in @entity74 when a homemade bomb exploded in his face			1
he will compete in a swimming event on the anniversary of his injury , the @entity85 website says			2
described by the @entity89 as " an inspiration to others and a true @entity76 hero , " @entity81 -- who made the swim team while at the @entity94 -- returned to the sport within weeks of losing his sight			1
in order to make the @entity15 team , he 's had to train hard and also learn how to steer a straight course in the lanes of a 50 - meter pool without the aid of vision			2
there 's no doubting his determination			0
" i am not going to let blindness build a brick wall around me , " @entity89 quotes @entity81 as saying			0
" i 'd give my eyes 100 times again to have the chance to do what i have done and what i can still do			0
" veterans of the conflicts in @entity73 and @entity74 also figure in the 300 - strong @entity16 squad , @entity115			1
cyclist @entity116 , who lost an arm to shrapnel from a rocket in @entity120 , southern @entity73 , five years ago is one of them			1
he found his way into elite sport thanks in part to @entity125 , an initiative to boost the recovery of injured military personnel run by the @entity16 @entity129 , with help from @entity16 charities , including @entity132			1
@entity116 , one of eight former or current @entity16 military service personnel selected for the @entity17 , was not an athlete before his injury -- but all that changed when he got on a bike at a talent - spotting day for injured veterans			1
' best thing that 's ever happened ' within months , @entity116 shed excess pounds , embraced the technical aspects of track racing and started to break national and world records			0
three years and two world championship titles later , he is keen to add a @entity5 gold medal to his haul , he told @entity1			0
" the way i think of it now is , it 's probably the best thing that 's ever happened to me , " he said of his injury			0
" i 've met new people			0
i 've tried a few things out , different sports ; done loads of things that i never did before			0
it 's kind of made me the person i am today			0
and i have changed since losing my arm , but i think only for the better			2
" @entity157 , who runs the @entity125 " @entity159 " program for @entity132 and was previously a major in the @entity161 , told @entity1 that @entity116 's remarkable achievements had been helped by close cooperation between @entity16 and the @entity76			1
shortly after the @entity125 program was set up in 2008 , a handful of @entity16 veterans traveled to @entity167 to join dozens of @entity168 at a sports training camp			2
there , @entity116 -- who was going through a tricky period in his transition to cycling -- was inspired by @entity76 track cyclist @entity174			1
quite literally , she " lent a hand " by letting @entity116 try out her prosthetic arm , specially engineered for cycling , in place of his all - purpose limb , @entity157 said			2
the gesture gave @entity116 a vital confidence boost			0
this year , 17 @entity16 veterans were the first overseas athletes invited to compete in the " @entity184 , " an event for disabled former and current service members staged by the @entity187 ( @entity187 ) in @entity188 , @entity157 said			1
it 's not necessarily easy for injured veterans to break into elite sport , especially competing against people who may have had decades to adapt to their impairments , rather than perhaps four or five years , @entity157 said			1
but @entity157 has high hopes both now and for the @entity195 in @entity196 , by which time the @entity125 program will have been running for twice as long			0
the self - discipline and mental strength of those from a military background , coupled with the access they have to military training resources , helps them make the most of natural talent and fight to the top , he said			0
in addition , some @entity16 @entity5 training programs are run alongside the equivalent @entity211 programs , so all those involved can access the same sports science experts and groundbreaking technological advances			0
" this is not a part - time endeavor , " @entity157 said			0
" if you want to be world class as a paralympian , it 's a full - time occupation			0
" watching around the world as the competitors from all backgrounds make their final preparations ahead of their big day on the world stage , excitement is building among those set to witness their endeavors			2
the @entity0 organizing committee says more people than ever before are due to attend these @entity5 , with a record 2.3 million tickets already sold and more set to be released			1
in addition , some 4 billion tv viewers around the world are expected to tune in live to the 11 - day event , which opens wednesday , the @entity187 said			0
the @entity238 has said it will also stream more than 780 hours of sport live on its website , www.paralympic.org			0
in the @entity76 , @entity241 plans to screen five - and - a - half hours of the @entity17 , in four one - hour shows and a 90 - minute special			1
the @entity187 says this is more than was broadcast for previous @entity243 , but some disappointed would - be viewers have set up online petitions calling for greater coverage			0
over the course of the @entity17 , @entity76 athletes will take part in 19 of the 21 sports contested and attempt to improve on their third place in the medal tables in @entity253			1
some of the events will be well - known to those who were glued to the @entity15 -- athletics , archery , table tennis and cycling among them -- while others , such as goalball , played by the visually impaired , wheelchair rugby and boccia , a game similar to petanque , will be less familiar to many sports fans			0
viewers will have to familiarize themselves with a key element in how the @entity243 work -- the system of classification of impairments , designed to ensure that athletes in each sport compete against similarly - abled rivals			2
the @entity16 government says it hopes the @entity17 will not only inspire more disabled people to embrace sport at all levels , but also help change public perceptions about disability			0
' pride and honor ' one of those at the forefront of breaking down barriers is @entity287 runner @entity286 , the first double - amputee to compete in both the @entity211 and @entity5			0
born with missing fibulas -- his legs were amputated below the knees as an infant -- @entity286 uses special carbon fiber prosthetic limbs			2
nicknamed " the @entity286 , " @entity286 made it to the semifinals of the individual 400 - meter and the 400 - meter relay final at @entity15 , competing against able - bodied athletes			2
he will be back in front of the roaring crowds at the @entity300 to defend his @entity5 100 - meter , 200 - meter and 400 - meter titles			0
his status as a world - class athlete , as well as a disability pioneer , has seen @entity286 grace the cover of publications from the @entity307 to @entity308 and @entity309 in @entity287			0
he also made it into @entity312 's list of the 100 most influential people in 2012			2
the @entity76 has its own " @entity319 " in sprinter @entity314 , a double amputee who could challenge @entity286 over 100 meters , and 22 - year - old @entity317 , from @entity318			1
the latter had his right leg amputated two years ago because of a medical condition but has swiftly transitioned from a talented able - bodied runner to a @entity5 contender			0
other @entity76 @entity5 to watch in 2012 include swimmer @entity325 , who took six medals at the @entity243 , four of them gold , and wheelchair racer @entity328 , who won five medals in 2008 and set a world record over 200 meters			1
" our @entity5 embody what it means to be an @entity76 , " @entity187 chief executive @entity332 says on the body 's website			1
" they will compete with the pride and honor that is inherent in representing the @entity76 , inspiring @entity76 young and old with their stories of triumph			1
" athletes from other nations will similarly dazzle and inspire those around them , as they overcome all odds to take home medals			2
from its humble beginnings in @entity31 , the place which also lends its name to one of the one - eyed @entity15 mascots , the @entity5 movement has come a long way			1
but in its commitment to bringing people together to test and celebrate what they can do , rather than what they can not , its core spirit has remained unchanged			0
@entity1 's @entity360 and @entity361 contributed to this report .			0

paralympic movement was born in @entity31 , outside @entity0 , in 1948
2012 games will be the biggest yet , with 4,200 competitors from 165 countries
in an echo of the first , @entity372 , injured veterans are among the athletes
they include a @entity76 naval officer blinded in @entity74 and a briton who lost an arm in @entity73
