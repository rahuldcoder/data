a @entity1 infantryman who lost all four limbs in a 2009 roadside explosion in @entity4 has undergone radical transplant surgery that may help him regain use of his arms			1
last month , the 26 - year - old infantryman had successful surgery -- a rare double arm transplant -- at @entity11 in @entity12			1
" it feels amazing , " @entity13 told reporters wednesday			1
" it is something that i was waiting for for a long time , and now that it happened , i do n't know what to say , because it is such a big thing for my life			2
" the last thing @entity13 remembers before being hit by an explosion in 2009 was that he was driving an armored vehicle			1
when he woke up at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity13 was alive , but missing all four of his limbs			1
" when it happened , i did n't remember too much , " @entity13 said			1
" i was still alive , so that 's really all that mattered to me at the time			1
" @entity13 is one of only seven people in the country to successfully undergo the surgery , and the first quadruple - amputee soldier , according to @entity38			1
the surgery , which took 13 hours and 16 orthopaedic and microvascular surgeons from five hospitals -- was also the first bilateral arm transplant performed at @entity38			1
all of the surgeons volunteered their services ; the surgery and rehabilitation costs were paid by the @entity48 's @entity47 and @entity38			1
the team of surgeons rehearsed the procedure on cadaver arms four times over the past 18 months , said lead surgeon dr. w.p. @entity54 , director of the @entity55 at @entity38			1
" on his right side we did an above - elbow transplant by connecting the bone , muscles , blood vessels , nerves and skin between the donor and recipient , " @entity54 said			1
on @entity13 's left side , " in order to preserve the elbow joint , we transplanted the entire donor forearm muscles over his remaining tissues , then rerouted the nerves to the new muscle			1
" while @entity13 is doing well , his recovery will be long and risky , the doctor said			1
" the nerves regenerate at the maximum speed of 1 inch per month			2
the therapy will continue for a few years , first at @entity38 , then at @entity27			0
the progress will be slow , but the outcome rewarding			0
" @entity13 is taking anti-rejection medication , which can lead to side effects like infection and organ damage			1
but he 's received an infusion of the donor 's bone marrow cells to further prevent rejection of his new arms			0
that infusion allows him to take only one anti-rejection drug instead of the usual three - drug cocktail			2
doctors call his recovery so far remarkable			0
watch : @entity96 eyes double arm transplant " now , i can move my left elbow , " @entity13 said			1
" this was my elbow , the one i had before			0
i can rotate a little bit			0
this ( right ) arm is pretty much not much movement at all -- not yet at least			2
hopefully , we are hopeful for the future to get some pretty good function out of it , out of both of them			0
" doctors said rehabilitation therapy is an integral part of the healing process			0
" the next two to three years , @entity117 's full - time job is doing hand therapy , six hours a day , every single day , once nerves grow in , " said dr. @entity114 , clinical director of hand transplantation at @entity38			1
" he 's going to be working very hard			0
" @entity13 said he 's up to the task			1
the thing he 's looking forward to most ? " driving			0
i used to love to drive and it was a lot of fun for me			0
so , i am really looking forward to getting back to that			0
and just becoming an athlete again			0
one of my goals is to hand - cycle a marathon			2
" @entity54 hopes the new anti-rejection regimen performed on @entity132 will become the new standard of care for limb and face transplants			0
@entity13 will participate in a anti-rejection regimen study that 's being funded by the @entity47			1
for his family , the surgery means moving forward with their lives			2
" our lives have been on hold for the last almost four years waiting for this surgery , getting him through @entity27 and getting to the point where he was pretty independent , " said mother @entity142			2
" and now he will be independent , and when he comes home , he 'll be the @entity117 we 've all been looking for			0
" @entity13 's message to other 's facing similar challenges ? do n't give up hope			2
" life always get better			0
you 're still alive ... just be stubborn			2
" advances in medicine are being made every day in different areas , whether it 's tissue transplantation or tissue regeneration , " he said			0
" research is being performed throughout the world with different ways of regenerating tissues and replacing arms , so they should be optimistic , as we are that there will be new treatments and modalities currently not available			0
" @entity13 said he 's is very optimistic about his future			2
" i just want to get the most out of these arms and just as goals come up , knock them down , and take it as absolutely far as i can			0
so really , i just want to get to the point that i can be completely on my own and just get back to enjoying life			0
