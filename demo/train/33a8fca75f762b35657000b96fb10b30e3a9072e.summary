-- @entity1 hit @entity3 's @entity2 at @entity4 saturday night the way he prefers to travel : with friends and family in tow			1
boasting a packed bill of today 's brightest young rap stars , the penultimate stop on his @entity10 felt celebratory , but tense			2
earlier that day , rumors swirled that the rapper might be apprehended by the @entity15 at the concert following an alleged nightclub brawl with @entity18 that left bodyguards and bystanders in stitches			1
but no bottles flew in the club this evening , and @entity1 seemed rattled but relieved : " when i woke up this morning , i had the choice to think about a lot of things , " he said at the top of his set			1
later , he hinted further at the stress of the previous few hours : " i wanted tonight to happen so bad , " he said			2
" i 'm so f * * * ing glad this happened tonight			2
" a steady stream of blistering rap music opened the show , with @entity35 and @entity36 plunging straight into their current hits to rile up the early audience			0
" turn up ! " may be this generation 's " rock on ! " and @entity40 embodied the phrase , leading a visceral set filled with little rapping and lots of gunshot sounds			0
" sorry to all you ' real hip - hop ' n * * * as , " @entity40 mocked after swarming through the crowd to club anthems like " @entity52 " and his latest gem , " @entity54			0
" later , @entity55 mellowed the venue with a grand sing - a - long to " @entity57 , " a slow burner featuring @entity59 that drips with all the songwriting promise the @entity63 - nominated @entity62 showed early in his career			0
performing with a full band , the once scrappy college - rapper has matured under @entity71 's @entity70 imprint , and the boss 's shadow loomed as @entity55 led the crowd in a @entity76 diamond salute , and interpolated " @entity77 ' " into the tropical " @entity78 " as tanned @entity79 belted along to every word			2
@entity10 is noteworthy for its openers as well as the headliner -- @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity55 all drape the windows into contemporary urban culture in 2012 , and each seem to have gotten there almost by accident			0
this , of course , is what makes @entity1 so exhilarating , and polarizing : the @entity92 @entity91 child - actor with a sheepish grin was never supposed to be a part of hip - hop , let alone at the center of it			1
yet here @entity1 was , shining bright and pulling in countless peers to orbit around him			1
after racing through some early hits at the top of his set , @entity1 promised to deliver " every motherf * * * er you want to see right here , " before introducing the @entity103 for their haunting collaboration " @entity105			1
" the mysterious young singer came off a bit flat early on , and seemed nervous despite a string of well - received solo gigs			2
but the enthusiastic crowd was forgiving , and if there 's one thing @entity1 does well , it 's share the spotlight			1
from rising profiles @entity122 and @entity121 to veterans the diplomats and @entity119 , @entity1 paid ample homage to @entity3 hip - hop , typically a locals - only fundamentalist sect that regionless artists like @entity1 have since knocked off the pedestal of hip - hop 's birthplace and sole proprietor			1
still , when @entity135 's @entity3 anthem " i really mean it " blared from the amphitheater , @entity1 was a fan first : " the songs these dudes made have influenced all of our music , " he said			1
" i 'm just a kid from @entity142 , but no matter where you 're from , make some noise for the legendary diplomats ! " most of the crowd , unfamiliar with their deeper cuts , took his word for it			0
after playing the doe - eyed lover - boy for much of his career , @entity1 has spent the past few months adding a snug layer of darkness to his persona			1
from the subtle warnings about catching bodies on " headlines " to the tougher talk on his now - infamous " @entity163 ' " verse ( the self - professed " real n * * * a " anthem ) , @entity1 's " you never know " attitude has somewhat validated the @entity142 - native in some corners			1
a brush with the @entity15 seemed almost inevitable considering his recent chest - puffing and associated acts , but the @entity1 onstage at @entity4 did n't portray any rebel streak			1
instead , the gummy charm fans fell in love with was on full display as he took an extended interlude to individually address members in the crowd from the front row to the nosebleeds			2
spirits were high , and he barely acknowledged the controversy surrounding the previous 48 hours			0
" the past few days of my life might 've been some whatever shit , " he confessed before launching into " @entity186 , " his moving duet with @entity185			0
if the lyrics were suggestive before , they felt almost literal on this evening : " we 've both had our nights , so do n't be so ashamed , " he sang sans the pop princess , despite many speculating that she 'd join him on stage			0
" you 've seen all my mistakes , so look me in my eyes			0
" chants of " f * * k @entity18 ! " rose in pockets of the audience as the song faded , affirming the weight of the moment			1
@entity185 was n't the only notable absence			0
for a show that was as much about his collaborators as it was his own career , @entity1 's major @entity210 cohorts were nowhere to be found , making @entity10 not quite the @entity213 consolation many @entity3 ticketholders had hoped for			1
despite @entity214 and @entity215 being no - shows , @entity1 alluded to bigger plans : " i had a call today with a short dude with some dreads who goes by the name of @entity214 , and i 'm gon na try to bring him with me next time , " he quipped as the night closed			2
" same goes for the beautiful ms. @entity215 , so bare with me while i work out that @entity226			0
" despite looming controversy and some missing teammates , there was n't much trouble in @entity1 's paradise , and he was emphatically clear that the fans on the floor were the real @entity234 : " you can open your eyes to what they write about me , and open your ears to what they say about me , but i do n't give a f * * k about anyone besides the people in this room , " he said with a slight smile as the show closed			2
" @entity3 : take care			0
