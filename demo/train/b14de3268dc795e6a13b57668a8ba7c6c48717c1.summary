-- the @entity2 and @entity3 region			0
the back roads of @entity5 and @entity6			0
@entity8 's @entity9 and @entity10 " forest distillery			1
" for seekers of premium malts , these are some of the touchstones of whiskey travel			1
now a new whiskey region is laying claim to world - class status			1
and at some distilleries , the youth movement is right out front and center			0
at age 26 , @entity23 has been tasting whiskey since she was 18 , primarily as a producer			2
she and her father , @entity27 , distill some of the world 's finest single malt whiskey in the garage of their suburban home in @entity33 , capital of the @entity36 island state of @entity37			1
in the terms of whiskey bragging rights , the @entity38 have already hit the distiller 's sweet spot above 94 out of 100 -- the score needed to reach " liquid gold " status in the ranking system used by international critic @entity47 in his annual @entity48			2
@entity37 has a solid share of the world 's single malt whiskeys that carry the " liquid gold " tag -- a testament to the island 's pristine water , richly flavored brewing barley , highland peat and a favorable climate			1
success on the global stage for names such as @entity23 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 has prompted a trickle of whiskey aficionados to drop into @entity37 distilleries to taste the product and discuss firsthand with the makers their distinctive characteristics			2
and where single malt was once the preserve of the over- 55 male , these days the buyers of $ 150 - a - bottle premium whiskey are just as likely to be young and female			1
" when i first started going to whiskey shows eight years ago , usually i was the only female , " says @entity23			2
" now it 's more like 50 - 50 men and women			2
" the world 's most southerly distillery visitor interest has given rise to a nascent @entity85 ( with a website that launched just this week ) that runs from @entity87 on the north coast of the island , through the picturesque central highlands to the lush valleys around @entity33			1
at the end of the trail visitors find the world 's most southerly distillery , @entity97 's operation at @entity98 , on the fringe of the @entity100			1
at 43 degrees south , there 's only the vast @entity102 between @entity97 and the @entity103			2
some of these distilleries -- notably @entity64 at @entity87 , @entity105 at @entity106 and @entity107 in the popular @entity33 waterfront precinct -- have well established visitor centers and tasting bars			0
for the others , it 's best to make an appointment			2
@entity114 near @entity115 is a one - man operation where sheep farmer , sand sculptor and occasional distiller @entity117 makes @entity36 's only rye whiskey at the rate of one 100 - liter barrel a month			1
" i may be the greenest distiller in the world , " says @entity117			1
that 's not a reference to a lack of experience , but to the size of his carbon footprint			2
his rye is grown , malted , fermented , distilled , barreled and bottled on the property			0
there 's no transportation cost , no wasted heat to dry the malt and minimal water usage			2
this sort of boutique operation is a world away from the blended whiskeys that cater to the mass market , where brands such as @entity145 , @entity146 's , @entity147 , @entity8 and @entity149 's @entity148 dominate respectively for @entity3 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity154 whiskey			1
as @entity37 's whiskey godfather @entity61 describes it , making a single malt is a mixture of science , art and passion			1
the big oily barley he uses in his @entity162 gives it a spicy , aromatic flavor that earned it the title of @entity36 's best single malt whiskey in 2009 from the @entity168 of @entity36			1
growing global demand @entity170 , based at @entity171 on the outskirts of @entity33 , has won its share of awards and praise , including a 96.5 score from the revered @entity177			0
but with output of just 20,000 liters a year , chief distiller @entity178 says it 's difficult to meet domestic demand , let alone the numerous inquiries he gets from @entity183 and @entity154			0
" the right attitude for us is quality , " he says			0
" we 're growing , but we 'll never be a giant distillery			0
" in the central highlands , where @entity189 operates @entity36 's only water - powered mill to grist its barley , owner @entity187 aims to make @entity62 a global brand through a network of whiskey bars			1
" we have five whiskey bars now -- two in @entity197 , one each in @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity33 , and we 'll open a new one in @entity202 soon , " he says			0
" my goal in five years is to have 70 bars around the world in cities like @entity207			0
" we scored a gold medal and two silvers in @entity210 in 2013 , so the @entity183 market is very attractive for us			0
" @entity187 says the highest rating @entity47 has ever given is a 97.5			0
" we got a 95.5 for a three - year - old @entity62			0
our challenge is to find a 98 among our barrels , " he says			0
at @entity216 overlooking @entity217 , @entity215 runs @entity36 's biggest whiskey distillery as a spinoff from the @entity220			1
" these are exciting times for us , " he says			0
" in a blind tasting at @entity223 a few months ago , we were named best @entity225 single malt whiskey			1
" @entity64 hosts 25,000 visitors a year -- as part of the distillery tour , visitors can choose to fill and wax - seal their own bottle			0
at the other end of @entity37 , @entity97 's x factor is the spring water that bubbles up from @entity98			1
" i came here for the pure water , to cool the spirit , " he says			0
" it 's a very small operation , so i have to aim high			0
