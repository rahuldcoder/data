-- in the wake of @entity12 's nuclear disaster , all milk , milk products , fresh vegetables and fruit from one of four prefectures closest to the quake - stricken @entity8 nuclear power plant will be prevented from entering the @entity13 , a spokesperson for the @entity15 said tuesday			1
all other food products produced or manufactured in one of those prefectures -- @entity8 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 -- will be diverted for testing , the spokesperson said			1
food products from other parts of @entity12 will be tested as resources allow , but the @entity15 's main focus is food from these four areas , the spokesperson said			1
the @entity8 nuclear power plant suffered damage from the earthquake and tsunami that hit @entity12 on march 11			2
efforts to bring the plant 's cooling systems back online to stabilize the situation continue			0
some of these food products have already been officially taken off the domestic and export markets : @entity12 prime minister @entity39 had previously ordered the governors of these four prefectures to halt the distribution of spinach and the local vegetable kakina and told the governor of @entity8 to cease all raw milk distribution , the @entity15 said			1
the @entity15 will continue to flag all entries from @entity12 in order to determine whether they originated from the affected area , the spokesperson said			1
levels of radioactive iodine in milk were found in four locations in @entity8 that ranged from about 20 % over the acceptable limit to more than 17 times that limit , @entity12 officials said sunday			0
testing at one location also found levels of cesium about 5 % over the acceptable limit , the health ministry reported sunday			0
and in @entity19 , a major center of vegetable production , tests at 10 locations found iodine levels in spinach that ranged from 5 % over acceptable limits to more than 27 times that ceiling			0
at seven sites , levels of cesium grew from just above 4 % to nearly four times the limit			0
keep in mind that the @entity13 only imports 4 % of food from @entity12 in general			0
and consuming the affected milk and spinach every day for a year would translate into taking in the same amount of radiation as a single ct scan , @entity12 's chief cabinet secretary @entity77 has said .			2
