-- i 've often said i 'd like to smother my entire body in soy sauce			0
but enough about my @entity5 profile			0
the truth is i 'm completely smitten with one particular sauce from @entity9 's called @entity8			1
it 's a little gift from heaven made with pineapple and ginger and garlic and sesame seeds			2
and if given half a chance i 'm fairly certain it could ultimately lead to world peace			1
" damn , this is delicious ! why are we even fighting ? " " your @entity22 is different than our @entity22			0
" " ah , right			0
" perhaps it 'll take more than just @entity8 to bring us all together			0
but it 's a starting point			2
unfortunately , however , the revolution wo n't begin in @entity29 -- because they do n't have @entity9 's			1
instead , what they do have in @entity33 , @entity34 , is a place called @entity36 's , which is an " unaffiliated unauthorized re-seller of @entity9 's products			1
" essentially , it 's like an @entity40 store for chocolate - covered nuts			2
( i 'm pretty sure there 's also a place for that on @entity46			2
but it 's waaaaay different			2
) naturally , this imposter store is now being sued			0
trader @entity9 , who declined to comment for this article , filed their complaint in @entity53 in may			1
then , earlier this month , lawyers for @entity36 's fought back , delivering a motion to dismiss			1
and that 's when the whole thing finally made news all over the @entity59			2
it 's a good old fashioned food fight ! basically , trader @entity9 is n't too pleased that the owner of @entity36 's literally crosses the border into @entity63 , purchases tons of food from their stores , hauls it all back to @entity34 , and then re-sells it for a higher price			1
of course , pirate @entity36 's does n't feel they 're doing anything legally wrong -- it 's the basic principles of import / export , and their website specifically points out that they even " add @entity29 compliant ingredient and nutrition facts labels			1
" calories 110 ( sorry			0
) fat 7 g ( sorry			0
) cholesterol 30 mg ( sorry			0
) so , as someone with six functioning brain cells and zero business sense , i have to ask : what 's the problem ? because , really , it all seems very win - win - win			2
trader @entity9 sells a lot of product			1
pirate @entity36 's makes a little money			1
and people in @entity33 can have soup from a box			2
@entity94 ? let 's all get naked in a tub of @entity97 ! but apparently it 's not that simple , for this is about trademark infringement , false advertising and a host of other legal issues arguing that @entity36 's hurts the @entity9 's brand			1
( that said , life is still pretty grand			0
and i 'm totally game for filling up the tub			0
) now , what makes this all so truly weird and amazing is that the owner of @entity36 's , @entity113 , calls himself trader @entity36 's " best customer , " and claims to have spent more than $ 350,000 with them over the past two years to supply his similarly - themed shop in @entity33			1
and trader @entity9 is basically saying , " hey , thanks for giving us heaps of money			1
" because , clearly , it 's not about earnings			0
trader @entity9 has worked hard to create a positive public image , and they certainly have every right to protect that			1
to @entity113 's credit , though , he has at least stopped selling perishable goods , for he says he understands that if something were to spoil , it could lead to health risks that might tarnish the reputation of @entity9 's			1
so , he really is trying			0
but with all the legal back and forth , things are getting rather intense			0
so much so , in fact , that @entity113 recently dropped the " p " from the name on his store front so that it reads _ @entity141 's			0
which is to say , he 's not overjoyed about the lawsuit			0
on top of that , running his business has become increasingly difficult			0
some @entity9 's stores in the @entity148 have begun asking him to leave			1
so he 's resorted to shopping with cash while dressed in drag so as not to be noticed			0
i do it to feel pretty			0
anyway , it 's all sort of a moot point for me here in @entity63			1
trader @entity9 is right down the street from my house , their shelves are always stocked with plenty of @entity8 , and a red , white and blue bald eagle soars over my really large tub			1
@entity94 ? follow @entity163 on @entity164 .			2

trader @entity9 is suing *copycat* pirate @entity36 's in @entity33 , @entity29
the owner of @entity36 's re-sells products from @entity9 's that he imports from @entity63
@entity163 : @entity97 from trader @entity9 could lead to world peace
