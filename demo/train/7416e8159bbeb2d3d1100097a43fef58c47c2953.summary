-- dear mr. @entity1 , i was sincerely disturbed when i found out you where planning on converting the " @entity7 " franchise to 3 - @entity6 this is one of the worst ideas you 've ever had about " @entity7			1
" and let 's face it -- you 've had some real stinkers : " @entity17 " ring a bell ? i want to believe that you think this is a good move for the franchise but please consider what @entity20 will do to the " @entity7 " legacy			1
sure , it seems like every other movie that gets released these days is @entity20 -- some a lot better than others			1
as a wise man once said , " this is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the @entity30			2
" i am a huge fan of the " @entity7 " movies			1
thank you for all the years of enjoyment you have given me			2
when i sat in the theater in @entity34 , @entity35 , in 1977 and saw " @entity7 " ( i refuse to call it " @entity36 " ) i walked away with a vision of not only how good can triumph over evil but how seeing a movie could be the coolest thing to ever happen to me			1
i was there for " @entity41 " and " @entity42 " and read everything i could about the movies			2
i had the toys and waited for the sequels you promised us			2
when i heard that you where going to make prequels i was a little kid again			2
i was in line to see the first one , opening night at 12:01 am and ... why did you do that to me ? to us ? there was little to love in " @entity56 , " and i was so ready to love it			2
i think this @entity20 idea is doomed to be a repeat performance			1
if you 're going to capitalize on me -- and people like me -- at least let us get something out of it that rivals our dedication to the @entity42 universe			0
to be fair , i get that the legions of die - hard " @entity7 " fans are partially to blame for your latest twist of the knife			1
if we did not see episodes @entity68 in droves , you would have never thought of doing this			0
and i 'll confess , as mad as i am at you , i will be there at 12:01 am again to see the @entity20 version of that torturous experience that is @entity75			1
i know i 'd regret it if i did n't			0
so would most , if not all , of the " @entity7 " fans i know			1
@entity78 : the people behind " @entity80 " we will say how we hate it			0
we will say we wo n't go			0
but as it gets closer we will cave			0
the worst part is you know we will and that we still care about your creations			0
please , mr. @entity1 , stop changing the movies			1
you do n't need to make them better			0
we already think they 're perfect			0
if you need to expand , then give us the sequel			0
give us something that is new and not just an indulgent reworking of one of the greatest movie franchises ever			0
i 'm asking " @entity7 " fans to try to stop spending money on your rehashes			1
by now it 's embarrassing how we act like starving dogs , happy with whatever " @entity7 " scrap we get			1
for the sake of our collective , cherished memories , this must stop			0
thank you sir for your consideration , and : may the force be with you !			0

@entity112 *announced* they would return the " @entity7 " movies to theaters , this time in @entity20
some " @entity7 " fans are not happy with *updates* to the franchise
could " @entity7 " fans be partially to blame for @entity1 ' *tweaking* ?
