@entity0 -- the breathtakingly incompetent way that @entity4 handled the introduction of what was thought to be the @entity9 's first @entity8 princess has me wondering : what kind of @entity12 operation is this ? given that @entity8 spending power is worth $ 1.2 trillion , it 's not surprising the media and entertainment behemoth wants a slice of it			1
but @entity4 's attempt has turned into a case study of how not to market a product to any group , let alone @entity8			1
apparently , @entity4 has the power to take @entity8 and " de-hispanicize " them			1
you start off chocolate , or cafe con leche			0
then , suddenly , abracadabra , you 're vanilla ! news : backlash for @entity4 's first @entity34 princess the first casualty is princess @entity36			1
meet @entity4 's newest princess , who is set to make her debut november 18 on the @entity39 in the tv movie " @entity36 : once upon a princess			1
" a tv series is scheduled to follow in 2013 on both the @entity39 and @entity43			0
@entity36 is the latest addition to a very exclusive club that also happens to be one of the most lucrative franchises in the @entity9			2
you have the old guard : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
then you have the racial and ethnic wing : mulan ( @entity57 ) , @entity60 ( @entity59 ) , @entity62 ( @entity61 ) and @entity58 )			0
now here comes @entity36 ( ? )			2
we 're not sure what @entity36 is			2
according to @entity67 , co-executive producer and writer on the project , @entity36 was born and raised in @entity70 , a " make - believe ' melting pot ' kingdom			1
" usually , a little ambiguity might not be such a bad thing			0
we 're a multicultural country			0
so what if a cartoon figure has an ethnic background that is unknown or undefined ? no harm done			0
as recently as seven days ago , @entity36 was @entity8			1
in fact , she was introduced -- informally , haphazardly and clumsily -- as @entity4 's first @entity8 princess by someone who ought to know : the executive producer of the tv movie , @entity85			1
in discussing @entity36 with @entity86 , she confirmed : " she is @entity34			2
" @entity85 also confirmed that @entity36 was the first @entity8 princess to hold court in the @entity9			1
the clues were there , but you had to hunt for them			0
@entity36 's name is spelled the @entity95 way -- with an " f , " not a " ph. " her mother has a dark complexion , and her name is " @entity102			1
" and that character will have the voice of @entity34 actress @entity105 of " @entity106			0
" ( @entity36 is being voiced by " @entity108 " star @entity107			2
) and @entity67 explained that , while @entity36 is of " mixed heritage , " her mother is described as having come from " an enchanted kingdom inspired by @entity95 ( @entity112 )			2
" news : @entity4 producer ' misspoke ' : ' @entity34 princess ' is n't @entity34 as the father of two little girls -- ages 7 and 3 -- this was good enough for me			1
the day the news broke , bracing for a @entity4 - style merchandizing juggernaut , i playfully posted on my wife 's facebook page a link to the story with the message : " we 've finally arrived			1
" then , ethnic pride gave way to ethnic squabbles			0
by being coy about @entity36 's background , @entity4 created a vacuum			1
into it , stepped three groups -- all pushing their own agendas			0
there were activists who saw the fact that the company was being vague about the princess as an insult			0
they asked : if she is @entity8 , what 's wrong with that ? why not just admit it ? there were @entity8 bloggers eager to engage in that favorite parlor game : " i 'm authentic , you 're not			2
" if @entity36 was @entity8 , why was she light - skinned ? what 's wrong with dark skin ? then there were those who , responding to the bloggers , pushed back against the idea that @entity8 had to look a certain way to be authentic			1
do n't we come in all colors ? it all gave me flashbacks to college -- and a headache			2
meanwhile , @entity4 had a headache of its own			2
it had worked out this whole complicated salsa dance that was suddenly getting a lot more complicated			0
it wanted a @entity8 product that would appeal to @entity8 but would also , apparently , not turn off non-hispanics			0
it wanted something that could be specific to one group and yet broad in its appeal , part of an ethnic niche and yet blended into the mainstream			0
it was easier turning @entity183 into a real boy			0
and now , because @entity85 had spoken out of school , and said publicly what i 'm sure the @entity4 creative team had discussed privately -- that , yes , of course , @entity36 is @entity8 -- the company was getting all the blame and none of the credit			1
and so , this week , it announced that there had been a misunderstanding and that @entity36 was , well , just @entity36			0
@entity196 , senior vice president of original programming and general manager of @entity198 , went to the @entity200 page for " @entity36 " and posted a statement that read : " some of you may have seen the recent news stories on whether @entity36 is or is n't a ' @entity34 princess			1
' what 's important to know is that @entity36 is a fairytale girl who lives in a fairytale world			2
" @entity209 , you 're kidding			0
how did i miss that ? @entity36 may be make - believe , but this public relations blunder is as real as it gets			0
whereas my mother 's generation , and my wife 's had to put up with being ignored and overlooked by the worlds of media and entertainment , @entity4 has taught my girls that there is something worse -- when being designated " @entity8 " is treated as a mistake that has to be corrected			1
the new @entity4 princess is not @entity8 and not historic			1
about this , a lot of @entity8 -- 52 million @entity226 who do n't like being played with -- are going to be , well , not happy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231			0

@entity231 : @entity4 's newest princess , @entity36 , may or may not be @entity8
@entity231 : executive producer said @entity36 is @entity8 , but @entity4 said she 's just a princess
he says a lot of @entity8 -- 52 million @entity226 -- do n't like being played with
@entity231 : @entity4 wants to *dip* into the @entity8 market but *botched* it with this attempt
