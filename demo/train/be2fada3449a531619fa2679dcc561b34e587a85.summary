@entity0 , the interactive panorama feature within @entity2 , has shared eye - level images of @entity4 , gone inside @entity6 's @entity5 , floated down rivers in the @entity8 and strolled the halls of famous museums			1
now the company is going underwater			2
the company on wednesday added panoramic undersea images of the @entity14 in @entity15 , the waters off the @entity17 in the @entity18 and underwater life around the @entity20			1
the stunning photos capture fish , plants , turtles and other marine critters going about their business in faraway oceans			0
now anyone can get an immersive view of the seas without getting wet or worrying about the bends			0
zoom in to check out a manta ray 's belly , join a school of fish or study intricate coral up close			0
more @entity15 wildlife news : albino whale puts on show the photos are part of a partnership with the @entity43 , an ambitious project focused on documenting the world 's reefs using high - resolution 360 - degree images			1
@entity48 is working to create a thorough archive off the world 's reefs that scientists can use to study the effects of climate change			1
by documenting reefs with photographs , it will be possible to determine the impact increased water temperatures and acidity will have on the areas over time			2
" if you want to reach millions of people worldwide , the first place you knock on the door is @entity2 , " said @entity62 , project director of the @entity43			1
the partnership with @entity2 ( which also involved a live @entity68 with a diver and a sea turtle earlier this year ) , is an attempt to get people invested in the fate of these ecosystems and the role the oceans play in sustaining the planet			1
for the 99 % of people who have never been diving , a panoramic photo is a vivid introduction			0
" it 's about introducing to the wide number of people on this planet the impact we 're having on these coral reefs , " said @entity62			2
" until we make coral reefs and the important ecosystem in the ocean relevant to people on the planet , we 're not going to get action			2
" @entity2 has used cars , trikes , snowmobiles and people outfitted with custom cameras to capture 360 - degree images around the world			1
for this project , the images were taken by a camera custom - designed for the @entity43 , the @entity104 , whose design was inspired by sharks			1
the rapid - fire camera can be controlled by a tablet in watertight housing , and it records gps data as well as the exact angle at which the photo was taken			0
to capture images at greater depths , between 30 and 100 meters ( about 98 to 328 feet ) , the group plans to send down special remotely operated vehicles outfitted with remote - controlled digital single - lens reflex cameras			2
nearly 90 % of the @entity14 is below 30 meters of water			1
so far , the project has taken 15,000 panoramic photos underwater , and each of those is made of three separate shots			2
they hope to have between 50,000 and 100,000 panoramic photos by the end of next year			0
future sites will include @entity129 , the @entity130 , the @entity131 and the @entity132 , an area where coral reefs retreated to after the last ice age			0
only the most interesting images will be used for @entity2 , but all will be accessible to scientists through the project 's main site			1
" one of the central concepts of this activity is to bring people on this jouney with scientists , " said @entity141 , director of the @entity142 at the @entity143			0
the @entity0 ( perhaps @entity151 ? ) ocean project was first announced in february			0
since it launched in 2007 , @entity0 has captured 20 petabytes of data in 48 countries			0
the @entity154 estimates that 95 % of the ocean is still unexplored .			0

@entity2 and the @entity43 are capturing underwater imagery
images of the @entity14 , @entity18 and @entity160 are viewable on @entity2
the project will help scientists *monitor* the effects of climate change on reefs
