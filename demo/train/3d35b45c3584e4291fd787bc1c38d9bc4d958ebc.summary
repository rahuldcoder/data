@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 members agreed thursday to take over enforcement of the no - fly zone over @entity7 , but stopped short of interpreting that mandate as a license to attack government troops who may be threatening unarmed civilians			1
" what we have decided today is that @entity4 will enforce the no - fly zone , " @entity4 secretary - general @entity12 told @entity2 's @entity13 from the organization 's headquarters in @entity1			1
under thursday 's agreement , @entity4 forces will be able to close air space to all flights except for humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self - defense			1
@entity4 also has sent a directive to its military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of @entity30 , according to @entity4 sources			1
under what some officials were calling " no - fly plus , " @entity4 would be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected , the sources said			1
and , in an effort to ease concerns from @entity39 -- the organization 's sole @entity40 country -- coalition forces would be allowed to withdraw from certain missions , such as those involving attacking @entity7 soldiers , the sources said			1
as for the prospect of a more robust mandate , one that the @entity49 - led coalition has followed so far , " that decision has not been made yet , " @entity12 said			1
he added that @entity4 will have outside help in whatever mission it opts to pursue			1
" it 's of utmost importance to stress that this is not primarily a @entity4 operation , " he said			1
" it is a broad international effort in which we will include partners from the region that have pledged to contribute to this protection of civilians in @entity7			1
" secretary of state @entity62 , who will travel to @entity63 to attend an international meeting on @entity7 on tuesday , gave an upbeat assessment of what the coalition has accomplished in five days			1
" we have made significant progress , " she told reporters			2
" a massacre in @entity71 was prevented			2
@entity73 's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective , and the coalition is in control of the skies above @entity7			2
" she welcomed the fact that the coalition includes aircraft and pilots from @entity82 and thursday 's announcement by the @entity84 that it , too , would send planes to protect @entity7 's civilians			1
" in the days ahead , as @entity4 assumes command - and - control responsibilities , the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern , " she said			1
" this operation has already saved many lives , but the danger is far from over			2
" @entity12 said the issue did not represent a split in @entity4 over the mission			1
however , he also acknowledged that , if unaltered , the agreement would mean the overall mission would have two parts , with @entity4 enforcing the no - fly zone and the @entity49 - led coalition handling a naval blockade and airstrikes			1
thursday 's deal was reached after a conference call among @entity106 and her counterparts from @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity39 , according to diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name			2
so far , @entity49 forces have shouldered the bulk of the mission , according to figures provided by the @entity117			2
of the 175 @entity119 missiles fired , 168 were from the @entity49 and seven from @entity109 , the only two countries to possess them , while @entity49 planes have flown almost two - thirds of the sorties and @entity49 ships comprise more than two - thirds of the total involved			2
the flurry of diplomatic activity came as the battle for control of @entity7 was continuing to unfold			2
after a fifth consecutive night of pounding by coalition jets , @entity7 gathered at a seaside cemetery in @entity134 on thursday for the funerals of 33 people @entity73 's government said were victims of an airstrike			1
state television said the dead were victims of the " crusader colonial aggression			2
" earlier , a @entity7 government official said coalition planes struck the suburb of @entity147 and state tv showed images of fires , smoldering vehicles and the charred bodies of the dead			2
at the cemetery , anger trumped grief and @entity73 's message was loud and clear : innocent people were wrongly killed and the @entity7 people will fight back			0
@entity2 could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were			0
in @entity134 , @entity2 reporters go on government - organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; @entity7 authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in @entity134			0
the reports of civilian deaths were given little credence by coalition forces , which launched airstrikes thursday near @entity134 , @entity176 and @entity177 in @entity7			1
" the only civilian casualties we know are for certain are the ones that the @entity7 government itself has caused , " @entity179 vice adm. @entity178 said			1
at the @entity185 , @entity184 ban ki - moon said he has seen no signs of a cease - fire by @entity7 government authorities , as called for by @entity30 , which was hurriedly passed last thursday as @entity7 forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of @entity71			0
@entity184 told council members , " to the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of " @entity177 , @entity176 and @entity195			0
he added that his envoy told @entity7 authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease - fire resolution , " the @entity197 was prepared to take additional measures			0
" @entity184 said he had sent his envoy to an @entity202 meeting to be held friday in @entity203 , @entity204 , at which representatives of the @entity73 government and the opposition were expected to attend			0
" their aim : to reach a cease - fire and political solution			0
" but there was no sign that any such solution was near			0
the battle for @entity176 , @entity7 's third - largest city , has been ongoing for more than a week			0
@entity217 foreign secretary @entity216 said thursday that many residents remain trapped in their homes without electricity and communications and with a dwindling supply of food and water			1
in the east , @entity73 's tanks were shelling @entity177 , where fighting had occurred the day before			0
loyalist forces still controlled the northern and western gates to the city			0
" this underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action , as do continued threats by @entity73 forces to ' massacre ' residents in areas under bombardment , " @entity216 said			0
the coalition has established a no - fly zone that spans from east to west along @entity7 's coast			0
@entity110 jets fired air - to - ground missiles on a @entity7 combat aircraft thursday that was in violation of the no - fly mandate , destroying it , the @entity244 said			0
the plane was struck as it was landing in a @entity176 airfield			0
the civil war was sparked in february by protests demanding an end to @entity73 's nearly 42 - year rule			0
the @entity7 strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend			0
though the rebels ' position may have improved since then , a @entity49 official said @entity73 's forces still have the upper hand			0
they remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well - organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said			1
@entity2 's @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0

*transition* to be complete by *sunday* night , sources say
