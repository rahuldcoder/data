-- i fell for " @entity2 " at a weekend - long destination wedding			0
i could n't yet pronounce either of his real names ( @entity6 or @entity7 ) and although his friends called him " sing , " i stuck with the catch phrase my girlfriends and i had coined the first time i met him because , frankly , my nickname captured his presence better			0
i had come around to a slight @entity15 of his real name by the first time we exchanged " i love yous , " but it seemed of little consequence when @entity6 then added that i would never be welcome in his family 's home			1
@entity6 had been told , all his life , more or less , that he was not allowed to marry someone like me			0
pronunciation aside , it had n't occurred to me that @entity6 and i made a mismatched couple			0
mixed - race yes , but i could n't fathom that my race could make me the " wrong kind of girl " for anyone			1
yes , it was white privilege that blinded me to the fact i might be the bottom of the barrel on someone else 's race card			1
perhaps even more so because i have been listening to the dialogue about how to make @entity41 more post-racial -- mostly as it pertains to black and white culture -- for so long that it never occurred to me that an @entity45 immigrant family might cry foul when their son fell in love with an all - american girl like me			1
but truthfully , i was blindsided for personal reasons , too			0
years before this i had fought with my own mother over our family 's prejudices when it came to love			1
i had more than one black boyfriend in my twenties , and a few others in shades between olive and dark brown			1
when my parents said that one of them should n't be invited to our holiday table , i stopped showing up also			1
that particular boyfriend and i only lasted six months , but i did not visit home for nearly two years until my mother and i agreed that unconditional love meant accepting anyone , of any race , who i chose to spend my life with			1
i do n't think i took such a stance with my family because i am @entity75 incarnate			1
rather , aside from this flaw , my parents are kind and generous people			2
parents often have a favorite child i knew their prejudices came from the ignorance of confusing economics , education and opportunity with culture			1
but they simultaneously taught me that i had a right to speak up for what i believed and to defend my choices			0
i only had the gumption to fight them and eventually end their narrow - mindedness because they showed me so much love			0
so i found it particularly saddening to be back in the same mess , 15 years later , dressed in different robes			0
even though @entity7 's family is educated , well traveled and chose to raise their kids in the @entity101			1
and even though , more to the point , @entity7 was a grown man			0
" you 've never told your parents that you get to pick who you love ? " i thought this but i did n't say it out loud			2
not at first , anyway			0
instead , when he told me his parents would never let him be with a white girl , i stared into his eyes and smiled			2
not because i was feeling his plight but because i 'd become cautious of him			0
this man i had woken up with earlier in the day now seemed like a stranger to me			0
specifically , he seemed like someone of another culture that i did n't know or understand			2
which was in fact true , because as much as we had in common , i was completely unaware of what it meant to grow up @entity45 -- both in his home and in the outside world			2
but @entity6 kept talking and what he was saying did n't allow me to recoil for too long			0
he wanted to be with me , no matter what			0
he had a plan for how he would address this issue with his parents and he wondered if i was willing to take the leap with him			2
his words shut off the alarm bells in my head and i agreed to follow him into the racially slurred forest where we would attempt to change what his parents , and so many , say in private to their kids about a mixed - race marriage			1
that turned out to be the most measured discussion @entity6 and i ever had about his family 's belief that marrying me might degrade them by watering down their culture or bloodline			1
because it was the only one in which i stayed silent			0
using my words , gently and respectfully , in many , many , many subsequent conversations about how i felt did in fact lead @entity7 and i to marry -- with the full support of all our parents			2
but it was only through continuous dialogue -- at the dinner table with friends who could advise us , and using calm voices in the bedroom with one another , and keeping an open mind on the couch at the therapist 's office -- that we were able to find a way to make our familial cultures meet in the middle at our mutual @entity41 one			1
seven years later and three half - @entity45 / half - @entity175 children deep , the discussion of race rarely comes up in our home			2
but only because we worked so hard to make sure the inconsistencies we were both taught in our parents ' homes about what kinds of people were worthy to love would never be a part of our home or life together			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity188 was *surprised* to be seen as an *undesirable* race by boyfriend 's family
growing up , @entity194 *battled* the prejudice of her parents when dating men of other races
@entity194 looks for a common ground : @entity41 culture
