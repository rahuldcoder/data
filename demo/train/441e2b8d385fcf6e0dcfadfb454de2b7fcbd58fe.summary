word to the @entity70 @entity71 , @entity20 : a word to the @entity70 ... earmark ( noun ) in a legislative bill , an earmark is something that is set aside for a specific use source : www.dictionary.com wasteful spending ? @entity32 : there 's a bill making its way through @entity83 right now that includes more than 8,000 earmarks ! the president of a group called @entity88 says these things are n't necessarily good or bad , it 's the process that 's problematic			1
president @entity33 has vowed to cut down on earmarks and wasteful spending , and as @entity92 tells us , he 's not the first president to try			1

@entity110 , the @entity111 : every president since @entity113 has promised his own crackdown on waste , fraud and abuse , and none have been particularly successful			2
