-- the space shuttle program should have come to an end a long time ago , @entity2 administrator @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview wednesday			1
the 30 - year program has been kept on life support because the @entity8 has not readied another vehicle to take its place			2
" what is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the world , the @entity8 , finds itself in a situation that we did n't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace shuttle when it lands its last landing , " @entity11 said			1
@entity2 originally planned to retire the aging shuttle fleet last september , but mission delays have pushed that date			1
but once @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 are permanently grounded , @entity28 's aging @entity27 capsules will ferry astronauts and cosmonauts to the space station and bring what supplies can fit in the smaller craft			2
and that will have to do , perhaps throughout this decade , until commercial cargo spacecraft are available			0
the last shuttle landing , according to the administrator , will not be in april when @entity29 is scheduled to fly			2
@entity2 says it wants one more mission to resupply the space station			1
that flight would be @entity45 this summer , using the @entity30 orbiter and designated with the acronym that stands for " @entity48			0
" but whether @entity2 will have the money for the flight -- about a half a billion dollars -- is in question			2
" we are budgeted for 135 and unless something disastrous happens , it 's our intent to fly it , " said @entity11 , " it 's in the authorization bill signed by the president back in november , so for me it 's the law and i 'm excited about it because i need it , so we plan to fly 135			1
" that would leave three flights before the program ends			0
@entity63 using @entity31 sits on the launch pad ready to make its last trip into space thursday			0
in april , @entity67 with @entity29 is schedule to fly			0
commanding that mission is astronaut @entity69			0
@entity69 's wife , @entity8 rep. @entity70 , was among 19 people shot in @entity72 during a political event			0
@entity70 is going through rehabilitation in @entity75 as she recovers from a gunshot wound to the head			0
during a news conference , @entity69 said his wife would attend his launch			0
" i pray that he is absolutely correct , " @entity11 said , " because for all in the @entity2 family , who have been praying with him ever since that saturday , and all of us who love her and him , it would be just tremendous , it would be tremendous for the nation			1
it would give everybody a big boost			0
" but with those launches , the nation is seeing an end to its only means of putting humans in space			2
it is also seeing an end to a program that caught the public 's attention nearly 30 years ago , with the launch on april 12 , 1981 , of the shuttle @entity103 on the program 's first mission			1
@entity11 hopes that at least two commercial space companies will emerge to transport astronauts to the @entity109			1
this will allow @entity2 to concentrate on building a new heavy - lift rocket capable of leaving lower @entity113 orbit			1
there had been concern whether the space agency would have enough money to develop this vehicle			0
@entity11 said the money is there to build a vehicle that will evolve over time			2
" when i say we are not going to do things the way we used to , we 're not building the world 's heaviest , biggest rocket right out of the chute			0
it 's going to take us ... a decade or so to get to the point that we have the final vehicle that is going to take the first humans to @entity131 , " said @entity11			1
the @entity132 has said it wants humans on @entity131 by the mid- 2030s			1
right now , @entity11 says his priority is flying these last three shuttle missions and bringing the astronauts home safely .			1

@entity2 's space shuttle program has three missions left
@entity2 administrator @entity11 looks to commercial companies for *future* space transport
@entity2 will focus on a new heavy - lift rocket
that rocket could " take the first humans to @entity131 , " says @entity11
