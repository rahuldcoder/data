-- @entity3 contributor and @entity4 as of 2012 , black actress @entity1 proves she really was n't acting in the movie " @entity6			1
" appearing on @entity3 ' " @entity9 " show , @entity7 called all black people in @entity12 government freeloaders who do n't work			1
@entity9 asked dash : " has voting with @entity15 95 % of the time and @entity17 , has that helped the minority community in @entity12 ? " " no , not at all			1
it still keeps them stuck			0
they 're getting money for free			0
i mean , as long as you are that way , they can keep you under their control ... " " they have a plantation mentality , " @entity7 said			0
" as long as they give you this much money , you 'll stay right there			0
you do n't need to know too much because if you do , you might start thinking for yourself			0
" i think @entity1 needs to get out more , perhaps visit @entity12 and the rest of @entity36 and see that all blacks , myself included , certainly do n't feel " worthless " under president @entity15 's administration			1
whether @entity40 or @entity4 , scores of black people -- @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and many many others -- are highly educated , gainfully employed , paying their bills and frankly doing quite well			2
dash is one of them			0
many black people may want @entity15 to provide more productive policies , but to suggest , as @entity51 does , that blacks are largely " uneducated " and " getting money for free " is a racist narrative that conservatives need to stop perpetuating			1
that kind of talk is an offensive nonstarter in getting blacks to consider voting @entity4			2
so is the often repeated meme by some black conservatives that blacks " have a plantation mentality			0
" whether you 're white or black , it 's never cool to invoke metaphors of slavery , which was a gruesome , painful institution protected by @entity40 in @entity36 that went on way too long			0
conservatives should remind @entity36 of the history of slavery and how the @entity40 perpetuates policies of paternalism that do n't benefit blacks			0
the " @entity9 " segment was about the @entity80 race between @entity40 incumbent sen. @entity81 and republicans @entity82 and @entity83			0
dash and other guests discussed how blacks in @entity12 have voted for @entity81 since electing her in 1997 but have not benefited from it			2
black republican @entity87 gave a much more reasoned commentary on why black people need to reconsider their blind allegiance to @entity40			1
referring to an ad produced by black @entity4 @entity93 sen. @entity92 focusing on @entity81 's record with blacks , @entity87 said : " i think state sen. @entity92 has done a tremendous job and service , by asking in this ad a very basic question : what have the @entity40 done for us lately ? black folks show up and vote 95 % for @entity15 , 95 % for @entity81 and ... what do you get ? eighteen years of poverty under @entity81 in @entity12			1
" @entity87 said that under @entity15 's presidency , black poverty and dependence on food stamps has increased and home ownership has declined			2
fact - based comments such as @entity87 's raise eyebrows and invite blacks voting for the @entity40 to consider voting for @entity4			1
@entity7 's comments are insulting and give blacks another reason to tune out the @entity4 and not take our party seriously .			1

black republican @entity1 , an actress , called @entity12 blacks freeloaders
@entity7 said blacks are " uneducated , " " feel worthless " under president @entity15
conservative @entity126 says that 's no way to get blacks to join the @entity4
@entity130 says @entity4 , including black @entity4 , need to stop racist comments
