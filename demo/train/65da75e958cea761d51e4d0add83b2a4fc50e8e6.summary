they may just have fled a war zone , but @entity4 children on recess at the @entity6 in @entity7 are n't so different from kids elsewhere			1
boys run around , wrestle and laugh outside a school comprised of tidy portable buildings on flat , rocky desert			0
nearby , girls dressed in pink with bows in their hair hold hands and huddle around a book			0
kids are resilient wherever they are			0
unfortunately , even with the hardships of living in a camp , these kids are still some of the lucky ones			0
after all , at least half of @entity4 refugee children are n't even in school			1
indeed , if @entity4 refugees were a country , they would have the lowest rate of educational enrollment in the world			1
and , without access to quality education , children here are at risk of not having the skills they need as adults			0
all this means that @entity4 is facing a lost generation			1
why is all this happening ? because the civil war is destroying @entity4 society			2
the @entity47 announced earlier this month that @entity4 are now the largest refugee population in the world -- more than 7.5 million @entity4 are displaced internally , while another 3.2 million are registered refugees in neighboring countries			1
that 's nearly half of @entity4 's total population			1
and while @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity7 , @entity58 and @entity59 have been remarkably generous hosts , the influx is so large that it 's changing some countries ' demographics , with refugees comprising at least 20 % of @entity56 's population , 10 % of @entity7 's , and 10 to 20 % of border areas in @entity57 , according to the @entity66 and @entity47 meanwhile , more than 80 % of the refugees reside in urban areas , not camps , and so rely on urban services , placing high demands on schools			0
all this is leaving education in crisis across the host countries			1
while each country officially allows @entity4 children access to the public education system , barriers remain , including school space shortages , having to learn new languages , transportation , the need for children to work for their family 's survival , and bullying			1
in addition , many are putting off school in the belief that their return to @entity4 is imminent			1
this creates very real risks to the quality of education for both host country nationals and @entity4 children			1
the presence of refugees has meant crowded classrooms and constrained budgets , and it leaves teachers managing students who are at different levels			0
continuous investment in these countries ' education systems is therefore important so that the quality of education does n't fall backwards			2
sadly , there 's no end in sight for @entity4 's civil war			2
and even when peace is re-established it will take years before many @entity4 can return to their homes , given the destroyed infrastructure and residual tensions within society			2
this is n't unique to the current situation : in protracted refugee crises around the world , the average time until refugees can return home is 17 years , according to the @entity47			0
the responsibility for providing formal k - 12 education for refugees lies primarily with the host governments , some of which are taking loans to cover the deficits			2
but while much of the international assistance response has so far been humanitarian , responding to urgent needs , what 's needed now is a transition toward development planning , in which longer - term , sustainable solutions for education and other sectors are planned and resourced			0
this means investing in building capacities of host country governments to provide education to these additional people in the future			2
donor funding will dry up over time , and the host governments will need systems to manage the additional children they must educate			0
moving forward , host countries and the international aid community should prioritize investment in access to quality education , with additional attention to building infrastructure to expand school spaces , understanding and addressing other barriers to access , developing transportation options , improving data systems , expanding school monitoring and support , and providing teacher training about refugee needs in the classroom			1
this will also constitute an investment in the longer - term education development needs of the host countries , meaning they 'll benefit , too			1
the suffering that has taken place in @entity4 since the civil war started in 2011 has been almost unimaginable			0
but by investing in the country 's future in this way , the international community can help ensure education is n't another casualty of the war			0
and perhaps help lay the foundations for a brighter future .			0
