@entity0 -- senators approved a giant farm bill thursday that is estimated to cut the deficit by almost $ 24 billion , largely by ending direct payments to farmers and replacing them with taxpayer - subsidized crop insurance to assist farmers in need			1
passage of the bill , by a vote of 64 - 35 , was a rare agreement in a chamber that has been fractured by partisan gridlock over much of this session			1
most of the bill 's savings are achieved through changes to crop assistance programs that have been in place in one form or another since the @entity24			0
" we eliminated four different agriculture subsidies and instead have moved to risk management so we 'll support farmers and ranchers when there 's a loss , where there 's a weather loss , it 's a price loss , through crop insurance , through other things where the farmer has some skin in the game , " said @entity26 chairwomen @entity25 , @entity27			1
not everyone agreed this was the best way to reform these agriculture programs			0
" unfortunately , it seems that @entity48 ' idea of farm bill reform is to eliminate one subsidy program only to invent a new one to take its place , " said sen. @entity44 , @entity45			1
the bill also saves $ 4.5 billion by making changes to the food stamp program			1
known officially as the @entity57 or @entity57 , these benefits , which were used by almost 50 million people last year , make up the bulk of the overall cost of the bill			0
" the @entity26 is getting back to operating the way it traditionally does , " said a satisfied senate minority leader @entity63 , @entity64 , as the chamber was wrapping up votes on scores of amendments to the bill			2
@entity72 have blocked many bills this session partly because they 've been denied by the @entity76 majority the ability to vote on amendments			0
senate majority leader @entity78 , @entity79 , seemed to agree			0
" the spirit on the @entity26 floor was good , " he said , because " everyone can feel we 're accomplishing something			2
" the bill still needs to be considered by the @entity86 , and it 's unclear when that will happen .			0

the measure , estimated to cut the deficit by almost $ 24 billion , passes in 64 - 35 vote
taxpayer - subsidized crop insurance to farmers in need would replace direct payments
move *signals* shift to " risk management , " @entity26 chairwoman says
@entity102 merely axes one subsidy program to " invent a new one , " sen. @entity44 says
