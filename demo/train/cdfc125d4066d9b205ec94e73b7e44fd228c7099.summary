-- @entity1 said the internet security breach targeting its networks was more extensive than originally thought			1
hackers also gained access to databases containing subscriber information for @entity8 , a @entity9 subsidiary that makes online multiplayer games for computers and the @entity12			0
the @entity1 division took its web services offline monday			1
that shutdown came 12 days after @entity16 disconnected the @entity18 console game network and @entity19 shut down @entity21 media streaming services			1
@entity1 said last week that it expected to start restoring some services this week , but they remain offline			1
@entity1 disclosed the first breach on april 22 , and then on april 27 , the company announced that personal info and perhaps credit card numbers had been stolen for as many as 77 million accounts			1
with the pc game network also compromised , @entity1 adds 24.6 million accounts to the pot. some popular games maintained by @entity1 's online division include " @entity34 , " " @entity35 " and " @entity36			1
" this additional network was targeted on april 16 and april 17 , the same days the other networks were hacked			1
while the infrastructures are separate , " there 's a degree of architecture that overlaps " among @entity1 's many networks , said @entity44 , a spokeswoman for @entity8			1
" initially , we believed that data was not stolen , " she said , but then the company uncovered evidence to the contrary during its ongoing investigation			0
" they used very sophisticated means to access the data , and they used sophisticated means to cover their tracks			0
" the information hackers took from @entity8 's system included users ' names , home addresses , e-mail addresses , phone numbers , login names , encrypted passwords , birth dates and genders			0
unlike the last breach , hackers did n't get the answers to security questions or have access to most people 's financial information			0
however , information from an additional 12,700 users stored on a database that was retired in 2007 was also compromised , @entity1 said			2
the data there included credit and debit - card numbers and expiration dates , but not security codes , for @entity84 residents , as well as direct - debit banking records for some customers in @entity87 , @entity88 , the @entity89 and @entity90			0
@entity1 apologized for the security lapse and outages on sunday			2
the company plans to offer @entity18 account holders a 30 - day voucher for the @entity97 service , which lets gamers download free and exclusive games			0
current @entity97 subscribers will get an extra 30 days added to their accounts			0
similarly , @entity8 will add 30 days to customers ' accounts , along with additional play time for each day the service is down			0
the company also says it is in the process of outlining how it will recompense gamers who own its @entity12 games			0
additionally , @entity1 will offer complimentary assistance for customers who want to enroll in identity theft protection programs			2
@entity1 says it 's working with the @entity113 to make sense of the security breach			2
on monday , @entity18 spokesman @entity116 denied a report that said the hacker group offered to sell @entity1 a list of credit card numbers stolen from its systems .			1

@entity1 says its online - game services were also targeted in the hack
