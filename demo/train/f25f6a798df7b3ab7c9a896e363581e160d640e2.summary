@entity0 , @entity1 -- what is most shocking about @entity4 now is how much she looks like her old self			1
her golden locks are back ; so is the sparkle in her eyes and her broad smile			0
gone is the short hair and thin frame we saw at the beginning of her recovery			0
yet she knows she will never be the same			0
stronger , better , tougher			0
stronger , better , tougher			0
" that 's how @entity4 describes herself			1
the former @entity1 congresswoman makes that declaration with determination and gusto			0
but it still takes a considerable amount of energy and concentration to articulate that , or anything else			0
being with @entity4 , who was shot in the head two years ago during an appearance in front of an @entity1 supermarket , it is obvious that she understands and absorbs everything around her			1
she follows conversation , reacts , engages and offers unsolicited ideas -- usually in the form of a single word or gesture that makes clear what she means			0
exclusive : @entity4 still appreciates gun culture but at times , even simple words are a struggle , like when she tries to explain how she spends her days			1
" occupational therapy , yogurt , " said @entity4			1
her husband , former astronaut @entity50 , patiently and quietly corrects her , saying " yoga			2
" " yoga , yoga , " @entity4 repeats , offering a playful smile to signal she gets how funny it was that she said " yogurt " instead of " yoga			1
" @entity4 and @entity50 : the new ' @entity56 ' of gun control she has go - to phrases that indicate how she feels , often saying " good stuff " to express encouragement and " whoa " to show something excites her or makes her happy			1
the right - handed @entity4 still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed			1
she generally wears a sling to keep it from flopping around			0
her right leg is also paralyzed			2
she wears a large brace and literally drags her right leg with her good , left leg to walk			2
still , she walks remarkably well			0
@entity4 has a service dog -- @entity71 , a golden lab -- with her at all times			2
she is also still aided by nurses , who come to her home , and by speech therapists , who constantly work with her to help improve her ability to communicate			2
she also does n't see very well			0
' yes , it 's tough ' : for @entity4 , a wounded life has a new purpose " not great at all , " is how she described her vision			2
@entity4 has limited sight in both eyes , no peripheral vision to the right			2
@entity50 jokes that when he wants to sneak up on her he will come around the right so she ca n't see him coming			0
it is clear watching the couple interact that humor helps keep her spirits up and eases the pressure of their intense daily struggle			0
for @entity50 and @entity4 , this is the new normal -- a life together that neither could have ever imagined when they first got together			1
she was a bright young political rising star and he was an astronaut			0
@entity50 said it is " different in a lot of good ways			0
" the biggest difference ? for the first time , they actually live in the same house , in the same city , in the same state			1
before @entity4 was shot , she jetted between her home in @entity0 and work in @entity111 , while @entity50 lived and worked in @entity112 , home of @entity113			1
they had a commuter marriage , which did n't allow them much time together			1
now , they are together all the time , living in a ranch - style home they bought last summer			0
and since january , the two have worked together as well			0
they started @entity123 , an organization and super pac dedicated to pushing @entity4 ' former colleagues in @entity126 to support new restrictions to help curb gun violence			1
@entity4 and @entity50 own guns , and @entity2 filmed @entity50 taking target practice with the same kind of gun @entity132 used to wound @entity4 and kill six other people			1
@entity4 says she would like to learn to shoot again , but it 's not a high priority			2
when asked about the @entity138 's argument that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " @entity4 becomes animated			1
" it does n't work ! " she says			1
" it does n't work			1
" she says if she were still in @entity126 , she would have supported new gun - control legislation in the wake of the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity150			0
@entity4 ' work and her recovery are not unrelated			1
those around her said she has noticeably made more progress with her speech and physical challenges over the past few months since she re-engaged in the world of politics and public policy			0
@entity50 said @entity4 does have moments of frustration , but both insist she is mostly optimistic and not resentful			1
" no. move ahead , " said @entity4			2
" @entity2 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
