-- a couple of high - profile openers could n't force the animals of " @entity4 3 : @entity6 's @entity5 " into their cages			1
the animated comedy topped the box office once again this weekend , while " @entity12 " and " @entity13 " delivered majorly disappointing debuts			2
@entity15 ' $ 145 million effort " @entity14 " roared a second time following its $ 60.3 million start			1
the cg - animated film dipped 41 percent to $ 35.5 million this frame			1
that 's better than the second weekend decline of its predecessor , " @entity4 : @entity24 , " which fell by 45 percent and had earned a slightly softer $ 116.9 million at the same point in its run			2
" @entity14 " has grossed $ 120.5 million over ten days , and is headed to a $ 180 million finish domestically			1
worldwide , the 3 - d film has grossed a robust $ 278 million , and will likely finish near $ 600 million			1
@entity32 's " @entity33 " prequel " @entity30 " finished in second place for its second weekend , despite dropping by a hefty 60 percent to $ 20.2 million			2
@entity35 's $ 130 million sci - fi thriller has earned $ 88.9 million since invading theaters 10 days ago , and it may struggle to match it production budget domestically			1
thankfully , the conversation - spurring flick has found $ 92.7 million overseas , giving it a worldwide total of $ 181.6 million			1
although many prognosticators expected " @entity12 " to vie for the number one spot this weekend , the hair - metal @entity42 adaptation could n't convince audiences to join the mosh pit			1
ages dropped like a rock , earning an abysmal $ 15.1 million in its debut — far less than comparative @entity42 adaptations like " @entity52 ! " , which began with $ 27.8 million in 2008 and " @entity54 " ( also directed by " @entity12 ' " helmer @entity53 ) , which started with $ 27.5 million in 2007			1
@entity55 says the film cost $ 65 million to produce , and there 's little chance it can match its production budget domestically after audiences , which skewed heavily female and decisively older , issued the film a mediocre " b " @entity63 grade , suggesting that it wo n't benefit from word - of - mouth			1
some are claiming that @entity12 ' awful debut is a sign that @entity68 , who plays rocker @entity69 , may have lost his @entity71 at the box office			1
while the a-list star appeared heavily in ads for the film , in all actuality , he only serves as a minor character , and the musical is so far outside his action / drama wheelhouse that it 's not a totally apt criticism			0
if there 's a star to blame here ( and , to be clear , i 'm not sure there is — i 'd bet the amateur look and sound of the movie is what kept audiences away ) , it 's lead actress @entity92 , whose first three music - and - dance features since leaving " @entity95 " have all been relative box office disappointments			0
" burlesque " found just $ 39.4 million in 2010 , and " footloose " achieved only $ 51.8 million last year — not a terrible result given its $ 24 million budget , but far below expectations			2
@entity92 may be @entity101 's go - to starlet for dance - heavy roles , but she 's not yet a legitimate box office draw , and her " @entity12 " co-lead , @entity104 , certainly is not either			1
in fourth , @entity106 's $ 170 million tentpole " @entity107 " dipped just 40 percent ( following a 59 percent decline last weekend ) to $ 13.8 million in its third weekend			2
the @entity112 / @entity111 showdown has earned $ 122.6 million so far ( and another $ 124.6 million internationally ) and seems headed for a finish of about $ 145 million domestically and $ 325 million worldwide			1
whether those grosses are fair enough to justify the " @entity116 " sequel reportedly in the works seems doubtful			0
rounding out the top five is @entity125 's latest , " @entity13 , " which , despite the presence of @entity122 favorite @entity120 , earned only $ 13 million over @entity124 weekend			2
that 's about half of what @entity125 's last comedy , the razzie - festooned " @entity129 , " earned in its debut ( $ 25 million ) , and his smallest opening for a traditional live - action comedy since " @entity135 's " $ 8.6 million bow in 1996			1
" @entity13 " received a discouraging " b - " cinemascore grade from audiences ( which were 54 percent male ) , with patrons under 18 giving the raunchy title an " a- " and those 50 and up issuing it a " d -			0
" if " @entity13 " did n't carry an r - rating , perhaps more enthusiastic youngsters would have turned out over the weekend			0
the failure of " @entity13 , " which cost @entity147 about $ 70 million , marks a pivotal moment in @entity125 's career			2
for years , he reigned as the most consistent box office draw in @entity101			0
though his comedies — like " mr. @entity154 " ( which earned $ 126.3 million ) , " click " ( $ 137.4 million ) , and " @entity156 " ( $ 162 million ) — were usually critical misfires , they almost always opened in the $ 30 - 40 million range ( or higher ) , and reaped major profits			1
it 's not just that @entity125 was starring in these films , either — he executive produced each of his 12 comedies that has earned over $ 100 million domestically			2
as a business - oriented filmmaker , no one could knock @entity125			0
but something changed with the release of @entity129 in late 2011			0
critics utterly savaged the cross-dressing comedy , and audiences who had been willing to laugh at the silly antics of @entity125 's amateur man - baby characters decided they had had enough			0
@entity129 became the star 's first live - action comedy ( i 'm not including dramedies " funny people , " " @entity179 , " or " spanglish " — none of which @entity125 produced ) to miss the $ 100 million mark since 2000 ′ s @entity183 , and @entity129 finished with a weak $ 74.2 million			1
" @entity13 " will be lucky to earn even half that amount			0
it seems that @entity125 ( and his longtime studio partner @entity147 ) may need to rethink their strategy moving forward			0
his formula worked wonders at the box office for 15 years , but @entity125 's shine is wearing off , and many of his formerly faithful paying customers are no longer amused			0
elsewhere on the chart , " @entity196 " took in another $ 10 million and passed the $ 150 million mark			0
after four weekends , the $ 230 million production ( though unceasing rumors suggest the budget was much higher ) has earned $ 152.6 million domestically and $ 544.3 million worldwide			1
in limited release , @entity203 's " @entity202 " continued its remarkable run			0
following an expansion from 96 to 178 theaters , the indie ticked up 40 percent to $ 2.2 million , giving it a per theater average of $ 12,253 — the strongest at the box office			0
after four weekends , @entity209 has found an impressive $ 6.8 million , and it 's got lots of life left in it			0
@entity4 3 : @entity6 's @entity5 -- $ 35.5 million 2			2
@entity30 -- $ 20.2 million 3			2
@entity12 -- $ 15.1 million 4			1
@entity107 -- $ 13.8 million 4			0
