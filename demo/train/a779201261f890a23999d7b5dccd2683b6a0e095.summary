@entity3 president @entity1 's plan to take the immigration system in his own hands is a daring test of the limits of presidential power			1
the steps he will lay out tonight in a prime time address will fuel a debate over his use of executive authority to enact change without the agreement of an opposition @entity18			1
conservatives are howling that @entity1 's effort to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation oversteps his own authority and infringes the @entity24			1
his backers say he 's simply exercising his power to select which areas of law to prioritize -- and addressing a major national issue that seems to elude @entity18			1
the law , however , may be as murky as the immigration system itself			2
" the issue is , if the president 's actions effectively nullify federal law , then they are unconstitutional , " said @entity32 , immigration policy analyst at the @entity33			2
" but if his actions merely channel enforcement resources to other areas covered under the law then it is within his discretion to do so			0
" he added : " drawing that line is a very difficult and murky process			0
" republicans and legal critics warn that by dictating groups of illegal immigrants that will not be deported , @entity1 risks infringing a clause in the @entity24 that requires him to " take care " that laws are faithfully executed			1
" all the signals of what they are planning to do suggest that it is beyond the bounds of the take care clause , " said @entity52 , a former special assistant to president @entity53 on immigration reform			2
share your thoughts on the immigration debate after @entity53 's own push for comprehensive immigration reform failed , he asked his legal team to examine his executive powers to change immigration policy			1
but they quickly concluded the kind of action @entity1 is now contemplating would go beyond presidential authority			1
" the president is taking an entire chunk of the law and simply declining to enforce it , " said @entity52			0
the @entity1 @entity78 is pointing to legal precedents established by earlier presidents who have used executive power to reshape the immigration system , notably @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity53 's father , @entity86			1
the elder @entity53 , for example , used executive power to permit 1.5 million undocumented spouses and children of people shielded from deportation by a previous law to also stay in the @entity94			0
@entity78 officials point out that number accounted for about 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the country at the time			0
@entity1 could cover a similar proportion of the current total of 11.4 million illegal immigrants with the moves he 's expected to announce			1
but lawyers who disagree with that view say @entity53 was using his power to fix problems with a recently passed immigration law — not acting alone after @entity18 refused to act			1
for his part , @entity85 used executive power to help 100,000 families caught in a loophole included in a comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by @entity18 in 1986			1
he also offered relief to 200,000 @entity115 exiles			0
the @entity1 administration is adamant that the president is acting within his powers to implement laws already passed by @entity18 and to prioritize resources but officials wo n't reveal the legal reasoning until tonight 's speech			1
other @entity1 supporters were reluctant to speak publicly about the potential legal arguments ahead of the address			1
but in essence , the @entity78 is expected to argue that @entity1 is simply wielding his constitutional powers to decide how laws are applied			1
the executive branch of the @entity94 government decides all the time whether or not to pursue certain offenders in much the same way a police officer sometimes turns a blind eye toward a driver traveling at 58 mph in a 55 mph zone but choosing to pull over someone else doing 70			0
it 's a concept known as prosecutorial discretion and @entity1 's supporters contend what he is doing is perfectly legal because he is directing @entity94 law enforcement agencies where they should focus their attention			1
so , instead of seeking to deport the undocumented parents of @entity94 citizens , the president is expected to channel resources towards enforcing @entity94 borders			0
officials said he may also require @entity94 authorities to spend more time seeking to deport felons or recently arrived illegal immigrants than those brought to @entity94 years ago as children @entity1 has argued that acting in this way is in fact more consistent with his legal obligations and authorities as president			1
and he says he is not infringing his powers by changing the law because a new president could take office and wipe out his executive orders with the stroke of a pen			0
" i ca n't wait in perpetuity when i have authorities that , at least for the next two years , can improve the system , can allow us to shift more resources to the border rather than separating families , " he said last week			0
" i would be derelict in my duties if i did not try to improve the system that everybody acknowledges is broken			0
" if republicans do conclude that @entity1 has overstepped the bounds of his office , what remedy do they have ? of course , they could pass legislation next year -- after they gain majorities in the @entity78 and @entity185 -- that would undo @entity1 's actions			1
but the president could then veto that legislation -- and it 's unlikely that there will be enough support in @entity18 to overturn a veto			2
@entity78 @entity194 are already taking the president to court alleging abuse of power over @entity199			0
they could add a question on immigration to the case			2
but that would risk turning what is at root a political crisis into an unpredictable constitutional showdown			0
and courts are notoriously loath to inject themselves into a dispute between separate branches of government			0
@entity1 could find his actions challenged in other courts			2
but an organization wanting to sue the president might struggle to find someone hurt by his orders — the legal term is " standing " — on whom to base a case			0
other republicans have even mentioned the " i " word — impeachment — but that 's also fraught with political peril			0
the most realistic path may be for @entity194 , who next year will control both chambers of @entity18 , to cut funding for @entity1 's executive actions			1
or they can wait until 2016 and elect a president who might overturn @entity1 's executive order			2
the debate over @entity1 's authority is partially of his own making			1
no one has made the case against the course of action @entity1 is taking better than the former constitutional law professor who now sits in the @entity242			2
under pressure for years by @entity246 supporters to stem deportations , the president has repeatedly complained that he can not just wave a magic wand and make things right			0
" this notion that somehow , i can just change the laws unilaterally is not true ...			0
the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that i have to enforce , " he said in 2011			0
@entity1 has pointed out that he is not a " king " or an " emperor " — words now being used against him by opponents and spooling on a loop on television channels			2
" our president has a preternatural ability to stay one thing and then do another , " @entity264 @entity263 sen. @entity263 said this week .			0

@entity1 will announce immigration changes tonight
@entity1 is making the changes without @entity18
the moves could prompt a legal fight
