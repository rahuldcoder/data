-- @entity2 's illustrations are bewilderingly complex - so complex that you might assume the artist uses a computer to render the exacting angles and three - dimensional illusions			1
and true , if you were to recreate his intricate mathematical illustrations using software , it probably would n't take you long at all			2
but the craziest part of all is that @entity2 does n't use modern technology to create his intricately drawn @entity14 series - unless , of course , you count a ruler and protractor			1

only instead of stashing those homework assignments deep into the locker of his brain , @entity2 uses these concepts to create his @entity34 drawings			1
in @entity2 's work , butterflies take flight amidst a web of lines and helixes , a shell is born from a conical spiral , and the mathematical complexity of nature begins to make sense			1
he says perspective and angles have always come naturally to him			0
" when i was young i began drawing perspective almost out of the blue , " he recalls			0
" i loved three - dimensional drawings and liked to find out ways to locate dots in the space			2
" before computer - assisted drawing , there were artists like @entity56 , who @entity2 counts among his biggest influences			1
" when i first saw @entity56 , i was speechless , " he says			0
" his artwork was so akin to my geometrical taste			2
" read more : origami - perfect blend of math and art working on an old drafting table , @entity2 began drawing his own perspective illustrations , eyeballing the trigonometry to plot dot sequences that would allow him to create curved shapes like double helixes and cones			1
if you look closely at @entity2 's drawings , you 'll notice each of the main shapes sits within a line - drawn square or rectangle - he began adding this to his works after realizing these scaffolding boxes created a more reliable way to correctly position the dots			1
" there is naturally a learning curve , " he says			0
" and as problems are solved , you become more adept and , again , daring			0
" as @entity2 became more confident in his skills , he began adding ink - drawn butterflies , insects and shells to the canvas and painting them with acrylic in order to add visual complexity to his work			1
each illustration takes him upwards of 100 hours , and that 's if he does n't mess up			1
" painting is very similar to cooking , " he says			0
" you 've got to be always careful ! " read more : these shimmering led installations transport you to an alternate universe even with the added embellishments , his work is restrained and exacting			0
but that scientific honesty is also what makes his illustrations so visually compelling			2
scientists and mathematicians often say there 's a comfort in their work because they know there 's always a right and wrong answer			0
it 's the same with @entity2 's art. there 's little gray area to be debated when it comes to angles and lines , and somehow that reliability and predictability translates into something beautiful			1
" i love @entity124 , and enjoy very much casting paint onto a canvas without rules , " he says			0
" but you 've got to make it to appear , if not " beautiful , " well done , and that is difficult			0

@entity2 creates *stunning* geometrical illustrations
he uses trigonometry and dot sequences to create da @entity151 drawings
each illustration takes him more than 100 hours to complete
