-- @entity1 is just one game away from a @entity4 final -- a year ago , she was just happy to be alive			1
it is a fairytale story at a tournament which has brought up more surprises than anybody ever thought possible -- but @entity1 ' tale is something special			1
in april 2012 , following a long haul flight to @entity13 , the tennis star was forced to visit an emergency doctor after complaining of searing pains in her legs			2
it was there that doctors discovered she had four blood clots in her legs -- had she ignored the pains , then she was told that her life would have almost certainly been in danger			0
she had been poised to travel to @entity25 for a @entity27 game , a journey which doctors told her would have left her body ' blue ' and left her on the edge			0
" i 'm lucky to be alive , " she said in january			0
now , she 's ready to make the most of her second chance			2
the 2003 junior champion is one of four women remaining with the name of a new winner guaranteed to be etched onto the famous trophy			2
for @entity1 , a hard - fought victory over 2011 champion @entity41 secured a first ever grand slam semifinal -- and the prospect of a place in @entity4 history			1
" it 's amazing , " she told the @entity47			2
" it 's more than a dream coming true , semifinals of a @entity52 , ridiculous			2
" last year i did n't get into qualifying of @entity4			0
" i was so calm on court , i went for my shots			0
@entity56 was playing really well in that first set			2
i just had to go for it from the second set on			2
" it is a marked contrast in emotion to that which @entity1 experienced after being forced to take a break from the game in a bid to overcome the blood clots in her legs			1
her ranking slumped from 182 to 262 -- a drop which led to the @entity72 withdrawing its funding			0
but under the guidance of former @entity75 and four time grand slam winner @entity77 , @entity1 fought back			1
she won her first title in @entity79 in september and rose to 43rd in the world after reaching the fourth round at the @entity82 in january			0
she reached the top 20 in march and believes the influence of @entity77 has played a major role in her revival			0
@entity1 added : " @entity77 was one of people last year still believing in me			1
" i have to thank her			0
the people believing in my i could count on one hand			0
" but @entity89 will face a tough task to reach the final thursday when she goes up against 15th seed @entity91 , who battled to a 6 - 4 7 - 5 win over @entity94 star @entity93			1
@entity91 , who finished runner - up in 2007 , edged a low quality affair where there eight breaks of serve in the opening nine games of the second set			1
@entity91 also courted controversy when she urged the umpire to abandon play when light rain began to fall with the score at 5 - 4 and 40 - 40 in her favor in the opening set			1
the crowd voiced its frustration , jeering the @entity113 lady before the players returned to action two and a half hours later			0
@entity4 : fast facts @entity91 quickly wrapped up the set and then moved into a 2 - 0 lead before @entity93 broke back			1
but the 20 - year - old @entity94 consistently struggled with her serve and was broken again in the 12th game			0
earlier , @entity120 followed up her shock win over title favorite @entity122 to become the first woman to march into the the last four			1
there was no need for a repeat of the @entity129 's giant - slaying slog on grass as @entity120 rattled out a straightforward 6 - 3 6 - 3 victory over @entity133 's @entity132			1
the 23 - year - old -- coincidentally also the 23rd seed for the grass - court tournament -- was in tears after beating @entity122 but said she had to pull herself together for her quarterfinal			0
" it was an amazing match yesterday , but i had to make sure that i had calmed down and was ready for today , " explained @entity120			1
" i have had experience of other years to help me			0
" @entity120 also spoke about having to " learn how to walk again " after a serious ankle injury in 2010 left her with no muscle strength in her left calf			1
" to come back on the court to compete and then to go even further than i did before the injury gives you a lot of strength , " she added			0
" it 's a different feeling when i 'm out there now			2
to have your hobby as a job is something that not a lot of people can say they have			0
i love the game so much			0
" @entity120 has never gone past the fourth round at any grand slam outside of @entity4 but she has an impressive record at the @entity160 , having reached the quarter - finals three times and the last four in 2011			1
the @entity129 faces @entity163 in the semifinals after the @entity166 world number four came through a grueling match against @entity169 's @entity168			1
their sizzling match - up on @entity172 was delayed twice by rain before the tournament organizers decided to close the court 's multi-million dollar roof			2
when the roof had slotted into place and the action finally resumed , @entity163 wasted no time building on her 2 - 0 lead over @entity168 in the deciding third set			1
but the @entity182 , who played with a heavily - strapped right thigh and then took an injury timeout to receive treatment on her other thigh , had to see off a final rally by the @entity169 sixth seed			0
the 2012 @entity4 runner - up needed eight match points , in a game that lasted just seconds shy of the 10 - minute mark , to defeat @entity168 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 4 - 6 6 - 2 and set up her meeting with @entity120			1
" she was playing unbelievable tennis , " said @entity163			1
" i 'm just very happy to go through even though i was struggling in the third set			2
" too much tennis , that was i was struggling with that			0
i 'm just going to keep going and try my best			0
" looking forward to her semifinal against @entity120 , @entity163 said : " we have known each other since our junior days -- it 'll be a great challenge playing each other on the grass			1
