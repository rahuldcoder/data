@entity0 -- shortly after his $ 447 billion jobs plan stalled tuesday in the @entity4 , president @entity2 vowed to break the broad initiative down into numerous , separate bills -- potentially setting up even more showdowns between @entity8 and @entity9 on how to boost the economy and where to get the money to do so			1
the @entity14 - pushed bill failed tuesday night to get the 60 votes needed in the @entity4 to proceed			1
a total of 50 members of the chamber supported the measure , while 49 cast ballots against it			2
in a statement issued tuesday night , @entity2 said that despite being an obvious defeat , " tonight 's vote is by no means the end of this fight			1
" he then outlined his intention to work with @entity28 and produce several smaller bills derived from the bigger plan			2
" in the coming days , members of @entity33 will have to take a stand on whether they believe we should put teachers , construction workers , police officers and firefighters back on the job , " @entity2 said in a statement released tuesday night			1
" they 'll get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle - class @entity46 , or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires			2
" the latter issue -- and , more generally , how best to pay for any jobs initiatives -- has been the most contentious in the debate , and the main reason the bill failed to go anywhere in the @entity4			1
specifically , @entity9 vehemently oppose a recently added provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6 % surtax on annual incomes over $ 1 million			1
@entity9 leaders have accused the president of engaging in so - called " class warfare " for political reasons , while @entity8 have called the proposal fair and accused their opponents of taking the side of the rich over the vast majority of @entity46			2
as he has repeatedly in recent weeks , @entity2 again pressed for @entity33 on tuesday night to " meet their responsibility , put their party politics aside and take action on jobs right now			1
" with the legislation to be broken down in several pieces , he said that legislators will now be forced to answer to their constituents " with each vote			0
" while the vast majority of @entity8 voted in favor of the president 's job plan , a few -- including @entity83 of @entity84 and @entity85 of @entity86 -- did not			1
@entity85 said , in a prepared statement , that " the things i support in this bill are outweighed by the things i ca n't support , " including " sending billions of dollars in bailout aid to states			0
" the @entity4 version of the measure has little chance of clearing the @entity9 - controlled @entity96			2
administration officials had indicated earlier that they were prepared to try to pass the president 's plan in smaller parts , if necessary			1
but it is unclear what -- if anything -- a sharply polarized @entity33 is capable of passing as the election year nears			1
@entity9 leaders dismissed the president 's plea , and characterized the plan as little more than a political stunt			1
" this whole exercise ... is a charade , " declared senate minority leader @entity109 , @entity110			0
" @entity8 have designed this bill to fail			0
they 've designed their own bill to fail in the hopes that anyone who votes against it will look bad for opposing a bill they misleadingly refer to as a ' jobs bill			2
' " " what matters most to the @entity8 ... is that they have an issue to run on next year , " @entity121 insisted			0
among other things , the package includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut , an extension of jobless benefits to help the unemployed , new tax credits for businesses that hire the long - term unemployed , and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters			2
but it is the proposed surtax on people earning over $ 1 million that has emerged as perhaps the most contentious dividing line between the two parties			1
the provision was added by key @entity8 to make @entity2 's bill more acceptable to his own party			1
@entity9 insist the measure would be devastating to small companies			2
" four out of five of these so - called millionaires are small businesses " employing over 300,000 people , @entity121 claimed last week in an interview on @entity149			0
" raising taxes in the middle of an economic slowdown is a bad idea			0
" in a speech tuesday afternoon to a union crowd in @entity159 , @entity2 said that addressing revenue streams is necessary			2
" in a perfect world with unlimited resources nobody would have to pay any taxes , " he said			0
" but that 's not the world we live in			0
we live in a world where we have to make choices			0
" asked last week if he is laying the groundwork to run against a " do - nothing @entity33 " -- a reprise of president @entity172 's 1948 campaign -- @entity2 told reporters : " if @entity33 does something , then i ca n't run against a do - nothing @entity33			1
" but " if @entity33 does nothing , " he added , " i think the @entity46 people will run them out of town			2
" with the economy remaining shaky and unemployment hovering above 9 % , the economy is virtually certain to be the dominant issue of next year 's presidential campaign			1
@entity2 has touted his new plan in a series of campaign - style speeches across the country over the past couple of weeks			1
" instead of trying to get compromise , ( @entity2 's ) embracing conflict , " @entity190 chairman @entity189 , @entity191 , said sunday on @entity193 's " @entity192			1
" the president is " running around the country campaigning on a bill that he knows wo n't pass -- he ca n't even get it out of the @entity4 right now -- rather than working with us on ideas that we agree on that would actually help create jobs			1
" " we want to go with ideas that work , " @entity189 declared			0
the largest measure in the package is the expanded payroll tax cut , which comes at a projected cost of $ 265 billion			0
employees normally pay 6.2 % on their first $ 106,800 of wages into @entity210 , but they are now paying only 4.2 %			0
that break is set to expire at the end of december , and @entity2 wants to cut the tax in half to 3.1 %			1
republicans previously embraced the cut , but have increasingly questioned its economic merit			0
a second key measure -- estimated to cost roughly $ 44 billion -- is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long - term unemployed			0
lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009 , and have since reauthorized the expansion five times			0
@entity121 has also blasted the bill as a whole , calling it a rehash of @entity2 's 2009 economic stimulus plan			1
@entity8 insist that measure helped prevent a more serious economic meltdown , while top @entity9 have characterized it as a failure that did little beyond adding to the federal government 's skyrocketing debt			1
" it reminds me of an old country saying at home that there 's no education in the second kick of a mule , " @entity121 told @entity149			0
" our view is we 've been there , we 've done that , we know that does n't work and we should n't do it again			0
" the 2009 measure " was a success in terms of job creation , " @entity96 minority leader @entity246 , @entity247 , insisted later in the week			0
" it was n't fully appreciated , but the fact is that it made a big difference			0
" the new proposal " is a much smaller package " but would be " a good start " in terms of job creation , she added			0
@entity1 's @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .			0

new : 50 senators voted for the bill , 49 against -- below the *threshold* for it to proceed
@entity2 says he 'll create several smaller jobs bills , each to come up for a vote
@entity33 ' failure to pass the bill could help set the stage for the 2012 campaign
@entity9 oppose the bill 's 5.6 % surtax on earnings over $ 1 million
