the first thing you notice about @entity4 's @entity3 hospital is its sheer scale			1
twenty - two buildings are perched proudly on the island 's south side , their original vocations ranging from maternity ward , to psychiatric unit , to the contagious disease wing			1
the @entity3 hospital complex , used between 1902 and 1930 , was where immigrants were checked before being allowed onshore			1
here , within view of the @entity18 , babies were born , people died , and a constant stream of patients with new illnesses arrived			2
it was the biggest public health initiative the @entity24 had ever attempted and now , it is open to the public for the first time in 60 years			1
the hospital 's record is impressive			1
no epidemic on the @entity24 mainland was ever attributed to an immigrant that came through its checking system			0
" there were fears of epidemics " the museum historian @entity38 told me			0
@entity40 had broken out in @entity4 in the 1890s , and " there were fears of smallpox ... and typhus			1
but there was no epidemic that ever stemmed from here			0
" the hospital , he added , " played a very big role in screening immigrants			2
" the second thing that hits you is the hospital complex 's authenticity			1
it looks like the dust has settled on a fire drill , from which no one returned			0
single stools are left overturned			0
buckets are left on top of closets , and bed frames lie rusty but intact in corners			0
the complex has survived extreme elements			2
two years ago hurricane @entity68 crippled the north side of the @entity3 , closing the immigration museum there for a year			2
but the hospital stood firm , testament to a time when buildings were built " very sturdily , " @entity38 says			2
one of the volunteer tour guides at the hospital , @entity74 , takes me into the morgue , where raked concrete benches tower over the area where autopsy tables once stood			2
" people always ask me , " he says , " when the concrete was restored			0
i tell them : ' it was n't			0
' " the third thing you notice is what makes this place so addictive to the curious visitor			0
it 's the blend of adversity and opportunity			0
patients were subject to suffering and humiliation , but they received top - class treatment and the opportunity of a new life			1
@entity3 has been described as an island of hope , an island of tears -- and the two fit in the same breath			1
this is not only a halfway house between origin and destination , but between captivity and free will , sickness and health			0
as part of its opening , the hospital @entity113 artist @entity112 has created an installation inside its brick maze			1
@entity112 has taken original photographs of the patients and doctors that walked its corridors , enlarging them to life - size and pasting them on the crumbling walls , windows and doors			1
@entity129 , president of the government - funded @entity131 group , says the use of historic photographs and their placement through the hospital " evoke some sort of an emotion , " making it easier to support the work			2
permanent exhibitions are not permitted by the @entity141 , which runs @entity3 , and the images can be peeled off if required			1
however , there are no plans to do so , @entity129 says			0
the exhibition " will last here for as long as it lasts			0

@entity4 's @entity3 hospital complex is now open to the public for tours
immigrants were stopped at the hospital and checked for disease between 1902 and 1930
@entity113 artist @entity112 has placed life - sized images of former doctors and patients on its walls
the complex is a mix of hope and pain , the *gateway* to a new life and world
