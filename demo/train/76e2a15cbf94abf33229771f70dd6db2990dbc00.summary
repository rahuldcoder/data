-- " @entity6 " is a light and tasty morsel of a romantic comedy in which two smart , funny , and basically sweet people try to conduct a cross-country relationship			1
the movie , which sounds like it was spun out of an advice column , is very high - concept , except that it has a gently authentic tone , a flavor rooted in its affection for the shrewd innocence of the 1980s			2
for the first 15 minutes or so , i actually wondered if it was set in the ' 80s			2
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) , who 's 31 , is finishing up her internship at a bustling newspaper , the @entity19 , and would do anything to land a job there			1
( i do n't know too many 31 - year - olds these days who even read newspapers , let alone dream of working at one			2
) @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , an easy - come - easy - go womanizer , works for a medium - size @entity30 record label , and what he does there sounds a lot like being an a&r guy -- a job that may be even more tied to a bygone era than newspaper reporter			1
the two meet at a quiet , homey bar that , miraculously , does n't have a blaring sports tv , and they proceed to bond over a round of the classic videogame @entity44			2
that night , back at @entity27 's apartment , they confess their mutual passion for " @entity49 , " and @entity27 's roommate ( @entity51 ) , a scruffy loser who is listening to their every move , blasts the film 's immortal @entity56 - sap power ballad , '' @entity58 , '' as they approach their first kiss			0
it 's funny , in a hot - tub - time - machine sort of way			0
after two love montages set to the @entity65 '' and the @entity66 ' '' @entity67 , '' i began to think : between this feel - good ' 80s jukebox and the fact that no one in the film has yet sent a text message , which year is this ? as it turns out , " @entity6 " is quite contemporary , but the wistful retro vibe is no accident			1
the director , @entity76 , is a veteran of documentaries ( she made @entity79 and codirected @entity78 ) , and here , making a major gear shift to mainstream @entity82 comedy , she 's out to take us back to an earlier vibe -- to a time when pop music was optimistic , and so were movie romances			1
@entity16 and @entity27 do n't just fall into glorified lust			0
they fall in love because they like each other 's company , and @entity17 and @entity28 have just the right sort of chemistry ; they act out the rhythms of companionship			1
" @entity6 " is mercifully free of the @entity99 plot twists that drive most romantic comedies , but it substitutes a development that , by comparison , may seem borderline inconsequential			1
@entity16 is set to go to grad school at @entity105 , and she and @entity27 know they 're going to be together only for six weeks			0
once she moves to the @entity108 , though , they realize they want to keep it going			0
and so they have to fly back and forth			0
( @entity113 has a workmate flirt buddy			0
) @entity117 , what do you think they should do ? the script , by @entity118 , is full of lines that pop. and @entity28 , who 's always had a unique -- and , to me , not entirely appealing -- way of making floppy - haired boyishness reptilian , comes alive as a movie star for perhaps the first time			1
he plays @entity27 as the kind of guy who uses his wit as an antenna for connectivity			0
@entity76 , as a director , is drawn to the @entity136 school of humane obscenity			0
" @entity6 " is filled with raunch -- a lot of it , delightfully , delivered by @entity17 's @entity16 ( she does a great , original bit about receiving oral sex )			1
but none of it is shock humor			0
this is comedy that catches the casual dirtiness of how men and women really talk			0
the blue dialogue liberates @entity17 , who has never been this womanly and confident on screen			1
so where 's the dramatic conflict ? " @entity6 " introduces real - world complicating factors that are meant to reflect the stagnant economy			1
that 's why @entity16 and @entity27 ca n't solve their long - distance problem			0
this gives the movie a surface topicality , though it also keeps it low - key , episodic , benign , and quaintly everyday			2
not that that 's such a bad thing			0
" @entity6 " may be a minor movie , but it 's also the rare romantic comedy in which you can actually believe what you 're seeing			1
