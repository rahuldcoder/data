@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 warned the @entity4 and other nations tuesday not to impose tougher sanctions in reaction to the @entity10 country 's nuclear ambitions			1
@entity1 already faces @entity12 sanctions and the five permanent @entity14 members -- the @entity4 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , all of which have veto power -- have been engaged along with @entity22 in discussions about possible further measures			1
" it 's high time for some people to open their eyes and adapt themselves to real changes that are under way , " @entity3 said at a news conference in @entity0			1
asked specifically about the threat of tougher sanctions , the @entity1 president said , " we prefer that they move in the spirit of cooperation			1
it wo n't put us in trouble			0
they themselves will get into trouble			0
" @entity3 also seemed to threaten unspecified retaliation , saying @entity1 wo n't act like it has in the past			1
" definitely , we will show a reaction that will put them to shame , like always , " he said			0
@entity3 's comments came one day after @entity4 secretary of state @entity47 and @entity49 foreign minister @entity48 expressed concern over @entity1 's nuclear program			1
meeting in @entity53 with @entity48 during a four - day trip to the @entity55 , @entity52 called @entity1 's recent announcement that it has started to produce higher - grade enriched uranium " a provocative move in defiance of @entity14 resolutions			1
" @entity52 further warned that the " increasingly disturbing and destabilizing actions " by @entity1 " will result in increasing isolation			2
" earlier monday , @entity52 told a town hall meeting in @entity65 , @entity66 , that the @entity4 believes @entity1 " is moving toward a military dictatorship			1
" @entity52 was responding to a question about whether the @entity4 was preparing for military action in @entity1			2
" no , we are planning to bring the world community together in applying pressure to @entity1 through sanctions adopted by the @entity14 that will be particularly aimed at those enterprises controlled by the @entity75 , which we believe is , in effect , supplanting the government of @entity1 , " @entity52 said			1
she added , " we see that the government of @entity1 , the supreme leader , the president , the parliament , is being supplanted , and that @entity1 is moving toward a military dictatorship			2
now , that is our view			0
" @entity52 called for stronger actions after @entity1 announced it is stepping up production of highly enriched uranium			2
" @entity1 leaves the international community little choice but to impose greater costs for its provocative steps , " @entity52 said			2
" together , we are encouraging @entity1 to reconsider its dangerous policy decisions			2
" speaking at the @entity4 - @entity94 , @entity52 said the @entity4 is " working actively " with its partners " to prepare and implement new measures to convince @entity1 to change its course			2
" @entity3 said at a monday news conference that @entity1 had no choice but to enrich the uranium because the @entity101 did not fulfill its obligation to provide the @entity10 republic with the nuclear material			1
@entity1 said last week that it had completed its first batch of 20 percent enriched uranium and will soon triple production			2
uranium enriched to 20 percent can set off a nuclear reaction , scientists say , but is not weapons grade			0
answering a question from @entity2 , @entity3 said it was not economical for @entity1 to perform its own enrichment			1
the @entity10 republic would rather buy it from other sources , he said			0
but the nation 's supply of enriched uranium was running low and @entity1 could not afford to wait any longer , @entity3 said			1
he would not confirm or deny that @entity1 would be willing to stop its enrichment program if it could obtain the uranium elsewhere			2
@entity1 enrichment of uranium at 20 percent is " wholly unjustified , " three diplomats wrote the @entity12 nuclear agency 's director - general in a letter obtained tuesday by @entity2			1
the @entity4 , @entity18 and @entity16 ambassadors to the @entity101 said the move is " contrary to @entity14 resolutions " and poses " a further step toward a capability to produce high enriched uranium			1
" such an enrichment , the three said in a letter dated february 12 , " is not only unnecessary , but would serve to further undermine the confidence of the international community in @entity1 's actions			1
" on monday , @entity4 assistant secretary of state @entity138 talked about the joint letter to @entity101 director general @entity140			0
" we referred back to the @entity0 research reactor proposal from last fall that @entity1 has yet to accept and we alluded to the availability of medical isotopes on the international market , " @entity138 said			0
" given these two legitimate and immediately available options , there is no rationale for @entity1 to attempt to produce its own fuel			0
" asked about comments made monday by the director of @entity1 's @entity153 , @entity154 , to the semi-official @entity155 that @entity1 would be prepared to stop its 20 percent enrichment , @entity138 encouraged @entity1 to put forth its proposals			1
" if they have ideas on how to enact the @entity0 research reactor proposal , they should bring them to the @entity101 and we can have another round of talks , " @entity138 said			0
" within the parameters of the @entity0 research reactor proposal , we are happy to discuss effective ways of implementing it			0
our problem is that we had one meeting on the issue and @entity1 has yet to come back to the table			0
" @entity1 insists its nuclear program is solely for peaceful civilian purposes			2
@entity52 said she 's not so sure			0
" @entity1 has consistently failed to live up to its responsibilities , " she said			0
" it has refused to demonstrate to the international community that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful			0
and last year , the world learned of a secret nuclear facility near the city of @entity177			0
" @entity1 could obtain the enriched uranium it says it wants for medical research by accepting a proposal under which @entity1 would ship its uranium abroad to be enriched and then returned , but @entity1 has rejected that offer , @entity52 said			0
" this has only deepened the international community 's doubts about @entity1 's nuclear intentions , along with the @entity1 government 's own isolation			1
" she added that @entity1 has also refused recent diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution			0
a soon - to - be released @entity4 assessment of @entity1 's nuclear program is expected to conclude the government has resumed limited work on a nuclear weapon , according to a @entity4 official			1
@entity2 's @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
