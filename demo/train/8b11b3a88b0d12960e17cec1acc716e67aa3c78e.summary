two state senators in @entity1 are proposing legislation that would eliminate the " personal beliefs " exemption for parents who do n't want their children to be vaccinated			1
dr. @entity8 and @entity10 's announcement came on the day the state of @entity1 announced the number of measles cases had grown to 99			1
many of those cases are tied to an outbreak at @entity17 in mid-december			2
the comparatively large number of cases in @entity1 this year and in the @entity20 the past year have sparked debate over whether unvaccinated children should be allowed in public school			1
dr. @entity24 : vaccines are a matter of fact @entity1 allows exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons and " personal beliefs , " and parents have been using them			1
" as a pediatrician i have personally witnessed children suffering lifelong injury or death from vaccine - preventable infection , " said @entity8 , who also wrote the @entity1 law that requires people who want to file a personal exemption to consult a doctor			1
he said the proposed bill would focus on vaccinations required to attend school			2
" we 're not reaching sufficient immunization rates and we want to reach the rates necessary to protect the public from those diseases , " he told reporters in @entity47			0
@entity2 affiliate @entity53 reported several members of the @entity55 will be co-authors of the bill			0
measles outbreak : different states , different rules on vaccinations @entity60 starts with a fever , runny nose , cough , red eyes and sore throat			0
for most people , it does n't get much worse than that -- and yet one out of every 20 children with measles also contract pneumonia , and one or two out of every 1,000 children with the disease die from it , according to the @entity76			0
while once widespread in the @entity20 , cases dropped significantly because of vaccines			0
in 2000 , health authorities declared that measles had been eliminated in the @entity20 , which meant it was no longer native to the @entity20 but continued to be brought in by international travelers			2
on monday , a @entity1 day care shut down because an infant there -- who is too young to be vaccinated -- contracted measles			1
the @entity86 inside @entity87 , a facility for 24 children of students and staff members , closed monday after it was learned that a baby under 12 months old being cared for there had measles			0
