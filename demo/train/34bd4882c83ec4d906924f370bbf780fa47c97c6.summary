-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 said monday that @entity3 must stop " bucking the trend of history and common sense " in continuing with its nuclear program and that any unilateral action by the @entity12 " carries too great a cost " for the world to allow it			1
@entity1 spoke at the end of a three - day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 for denuclearization on the @entity20 and getting @entity21 back to the negotiating table			1
" the @entity2 remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization , but the burden is on @entity21 , " @entity1 said in @entity23			1
" @entity16 must take meaningful steps to show it will honor commitments it has already made " and the norms of international law			1
last month , @entity3 scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the korean war and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the @entity20			1
it also recently pledged to restart its @entity38 nuclear complex , including a uranium enrichment plant and a reactor that was shut down under an agreement reached in october 2007 during talks with @entity3 , the @entity2 , and four other countries			2
" the world does not need more potential for war , so we will stand together			0
and we welcome @entity17 's strong commitment ... to the denuclearization of the @entity20 , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 : a nuclear @entity3 is unacceptable " the stakes are far too high and the global economy is far too fragile for anyone to allow these inherited problems to divide the region and inflame it			1
" a @entity55 official said monday there are no plans to move toward direct talks , however , " because @entity3 has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction			1
" @entity21 on sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue , one by @entity16 last week regarding the @entity12 's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate			0
a statement via @entity68 , the state - run news agency , called the @entity16 's offer a " crafty trick " and " empty words without any content			2
" a @entity68 commentary monday was titled , " @entity2 is to blame for escalating tension on @entity20			0
" @entity1 's trip finishes on one of the biggest dates on the @entity79 : " @entity80 , " when citizens celebrate the birthday of the country 's late founder and " eternal president , " @entity85			1
this year marks his 101st birthday			0
current leader @entity88 paid tribute monday to @entity85 , his grandfather , as well as his late father , @entity91 , visiting the halls where both men lie in state			0
it was believed to be @entity85 's first public appearance in two weeks			0
amid the pageantry , patriotism and festive images being played on @entity79 state television monday , many around the world wonder whether this will also be the day @entity3 decides to launch a missile , perhaps in a show of bravado after weeks of nuclear threats			1
some scholars say a launch is still possible , if not monday , then in the coming days			0
@entity0 correspondent @entity110 reports from @entity111 that because april 15 is the founder 's birthday , @entity3 would not conduct a missile launch then with the possibility of failure hanging over them			2
@entity79 missile : should @entity2 shoot it down ? @entity21 made good on its promise to launch a long - range rocket around the time of @entity85 's birthday last year ; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea			2
@entity3 has made more threats since then			2
it launched a rocket in december that apparently put a satellite into orbit , and in response , the @entity132 approved broadening sanctions against the country			0
angered by those sanctions , @entity21 announced in january it was planning a new nuclear test and more long - range rocket launches as part what it called a new phase of confrontation with the @entity2			0
it carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in february , and last month , @entity21 threatened for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the @entity2 and @entity16			0
the @entity12 also threatened to attack @entity2 and @entity16 bases			0
the @entity3 we rarely see @entity0 's @entity148 contributed to this report .			2
