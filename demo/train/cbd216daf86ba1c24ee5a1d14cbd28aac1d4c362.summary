@entity0 -- a @entity4 food processing plant is voluntarily recalling up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachio products that may have been contaminated with salmonella , the @entity2 announced monday			1
salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by @entity9 , one company that purchased the nuts			1
the nuts came from @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity4 , about 75 miles south of @entity14			1
they were largely distributed in 2,000 - pound containers to food wholesalers who would then package them for resale or incorporate them as ingredients in other products , such as ice cream and trail mix. no illnesses have been linked to this case , said dr. @entity27 , @entity2 's associate commissioner			1
but salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by @entity9 , one of about three dozen companies that purchase pistachios from @entity12 , he said			1
@entity9 notified the @entity2 on march 24			2
@entity12 did not immediately respond to @entity1 requests for comment			2
@entity27 emphasized that unlike the recent case of salmonella - tainted peanut butter , this recall was not prompted by an sickness outbreak , saying the decision was a " proactive " move			2
he said the @entity2 has received two recent complaints , from the @entity42 coasts , from people who say they became ill after eating pistachio products , but a link to @entity12 has not been confirmed , he said			1
the @entity2 is advising consumers not to eat any pistachio products , but not to throw them out , either , because additional recalls are likely and having products that could be turned in would allow for easier tracing of contamination			0
the agency is setting up a web site to update the public			0
dr. @entity55 , head of the @entity4 health department 's food and drug division , said it 's likely that the roasted pistachios will be found in a wide variety of products			1
he noted that @entity12 is the second - largest pistachio processor in the nation			1
raw pistachios are roasted to a temperature that should kill salmonella , @entity27 said			0
because the roasted products tested positive for salmonella suggest cross-contamination with raw products			0
@entity27 added that the @entity12 recall is related to the one announced friday by @entity72 , a grocery store chain with stores in 31 states			2
@entity72 recalled @entity75 shelled pistachios from its retail stores because of possible salmonella contamination			0
@entity72 , in a statement friday , said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the product			0
in february , @entity72 was among retailers that recalled peanut products tied to the @entity85 , a @entity86 - based company accused by the @entity2 of knowingly selling peanut butter and peanut paste that was contaminated with salmonella			0
@entity85 's peanut processing plant in @entity91 , @entity92 , is being investigated in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people and has been linked to eight deaths .			0

the pistachios , mostly sold to wholesalers , came from @entity12 in @entity4
@entity9 is one of three dozen companies to purchase pistachios from @entity12
no illnesses have been linked to this case so far
@entity12 is the second - largest pistachio processor in the nation
