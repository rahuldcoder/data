-- @entity1 , who filed the original case that could upend the @entity4 , says just getting the case to this point is a kind of victory			1
" we 've made a huge step forward and a huge difference in how people look at us , " she said			0
" and so , it 'll happen			0
another year if not now			0
" it was the death of @entity1 's life partner , @entity16 , that led to the case			1
theirs was not a fleeting romance -- the women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs , laughs and tears			1
they also shared what they 'd earned together , including from @entity1 's job as a programmer with @entity29 and @entity30 's work as a psychologist			1
5 things we learned from day one of oral arguments " we were mildly affluent and extremely happy , " @entity1 said			1
" we were like most couples			0
" but even after they married in 2007 in @entity37 , some 40 years into their courtship , the two women were not " like most couples " in the eyes of the state of @entity42 , where they lived , nor in the eyes of the @entity46 government , which under the @entity4 mandates that a spouse , as legally defined , must be a person of the opposite sex			1
this fact hit @entity1 hard in 2009 , while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after @entity16 's death			1
as she recovered and mourned , @entity1 realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes -- $ 363,053 more than was warranted , she later claimed in court -- because @entity16 was , in legal terms , little more than a friend			1
" it was incredible indignation , " @entity1 recalled feeling			1
" just the numbers were so cruel			0
" this anger gave way to action			0
why , she and her lawyers argued , should her relationship with @entity16 be any different when it came to rights , taxes and more than a heterosexual couple ? why should @entity1 have to pay , literally , for losing her soulmate -- even though , by 2009 , @entity42 courts had recognized that " foreign same - sex marriages " should be recognized in the state as valid ? in october , @entity1 got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd @entity46 @entity79			1
that court found , in her favor , that the @entity4 violates the @entity84 's equal protection clause and thus she should n't have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner 's death			1
this follows a similar ruling , in may , from another federal appeals court in @entity92			0
federal appeals court strikes down @entity4 neither opinion settles the matter for good			0
that is expected to happen when the @entity97 will weigh the constitutionality of the @entity4 through the prism of @entity1 and @entity16 's story			1
it is one of two cases related to same - sex marriage that the high court is considering			0
the other addresses @entity108 's @entity107			0
the court is expected to rule on both cases by mid-june			0
even with those cases pending , @entity1 said last fall -- when the lower court decided in her favor , three years after @entity16 's death -- that she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate			1
it was a day she relished , and one she did n't entirely expect after all her heartache			0
" what i 'm feeling is elated , " @entity1 said			1
" did i ever think it could come to be , altogether ? ... not a chance in hell			0
" by the numbers : same - sex marriage instant chemistry in @entity124 born in @entity125 in 1929 , on the eve of the @entity127 , @entity1 graduated from @entity128 and earned a master 's degree , in 1957 , from @entity130 , according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school 's alumni magazine			1
she had come to @entity42 hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage , according to the report			2
and professionally , she found it -- working for @entity130 's math department and soon entering data into its @entity140 , one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation			0
her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job , and to excel , at @entity29			0
but something was missing in her life , personally			0
or , as @entity1 put it more succinctly , " i suddenly could n't take it anymore			1
" in the documentary " @entity153 and @entity16 : @entity157 , " she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her " where the lesbians go			2
" and so @entity1 spent one friday night at @entity158 , a restaurant in @entity42 's @entity124			1
" somebody brought @entity16 over and introduced her			2
and we ended up dancing , " she recalled			0
" and we immediately just fit , " added @entity16 , on the documentary			2
timeline : same - sex marriage after reuniting two years later , according to their @entity169 ' wedding announcement , their connection proved deep and lasting			0
in 1967 , @entity16 proposed marriage with a round diamond pin			2
a year later , they purchased a house together in @entity174 , according to the @entity176 story			0
yet while the gay rights ' movement took off after the 1969 @entity179 , which occurred while @entity1 and @entity16 were vacationing in @entity180 , an actual marriage -- a legal union -- seemed out of the question			1
marriage , at last , and then heartache regardless , their love remained strong			0
on the documentary , filmed around 2007 , @entity16 said , " each one of us , in fact , looks different from how we looked when we met			1
but if i look at @entity192 now , she looks exactly the same to me			0
" @entity1 had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner , who suffered from multiple sclerosis			2
and it was after getting a " bad prognosis ( that ) i had another year to live and that was it " that @entity16 proposed again			2
" and i said yes , " @entity1 recalled			2
" she said , ' so do @entity200 ' " video shows @entity16 being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair			2
it was from that seat -- on may 22 , 2007 , at @entity37 's @entity206 -- that she gave her vows to make their marriage official in @entity209			1
" i , @entity1 , choose you , @entity1 , to be my lawful , wedded spouse , " she said			2
" for richer and for poorer , in sickness and in health , until death do us part			0
" married same - sex couple awaits epic high court appeal having happily gone four decades without , @entity1 soon realized how much the marriage meant to her			1
it made her and @entity16 's love legitimate and all the more real			2
" it 's different because somewhere you 're a hidden person , and suddenly you 're a citizen of the world , " she said in october of 2012			0
but what happened as @entity16 's condition worsened , and after her death , proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country			1
and the fact that @entity42 legalized same - sex marriage in 2011 did n't mean that @entity1 , for example , would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she 'd given to the government			1
that could happen , however , if the @entity97 upholds the appeals court ruling			1
that is @entity1 's hope , as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade			2
in the meantime , @entity1 said she 's proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with @entity16			1
she hopes , through her struggle , to help make it so gay teenagers can " fall in love knowing there 's a future , " that children of gay couples wo n't feel the need to explain their families , and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past			0
" i feel like i 'm representing them			0
" couple fights for right to marry			0

@entity1 and @entity1 met in @entity42 and were together more than 40 years
they could n't legally marry in the @entity46 , but they did tie the knot in 2007 in @entity37
when @entity16 died , @entity1 paid a large inheritance tax -- then fought it in court
a court rules their union was valid ; the @entity97 is hearing the case
