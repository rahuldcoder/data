critics of president @entity2 's foreign policy are getting louder by the day , and that poses risks for @entity5 this fall and even in 2016			1
according to previews of @entity9 's memoirs , " @entity14 , " the former secretary of state distances herself from @entity2 on certain decisions , such as on the question of whether to arm @entity13 rebels			1
she wanted to be more aggressive ; he did not			0
@entity5 have grown more nervous about foreign policy as @entity2 has been working hard to respond to critics who say has n't taken a tough - enough line			1
the controversy over the deal to secure the release of @entity23 sgt. @entity22 in exchange for five @entity26 prisoners has flared into an extraordinarily heated debate			1
@entity2 has watched as his approval rating for handling international affairs has fallen to 41 %			2
last month , @entity2 had to stand by as @entity30 launched another round of congressional investigations into the deaths of four @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			2
@entity38 's aggressive moves into the @entity39 stirred talk of a new @entity41 and concern that the president did n't really have a viable response to this kind of aggression			2
opinion : why we leave no man behind more recently , the controversies shifted to the president 's broader vision or lack thereof			0
republicans found a lot to dislike in his address at @entity58 , where @entity2 indicated that the nation should step back from using military power as freely as it has done in the past			2
soon after came the news about the release of @entity22 , in exchange for the release of five notorious @entity26 prisoners			2
republicans were quick to accuse the president of negotiating with terrorists			0
they have also accused him of violating the law by failing to inform @entity73 of the impending deal			0
even though @entity5 point to a number of huge accomplishments during the @entity2 presidency -- the killing of @entity80 , the drawdown of the wars in @entity83 and @entity84 and diplomatic initiatives to bring nuclear disarmament in @entity87 without bloodshed -- the critics have upped their volume			2
all of the recent stories add up to the potential for foreign policy to emerge as a potent issue in the midterm campaigns this fall			1
congressional democrats could suffer as a result of the unhappiness with the administration 's policies			0
even though midterm elections generally focus on bread and butter questions about the health of the economy , as well as local concerns , there are times when foreign policy can hurt the party of the president			1
in 1966 , for instance , republicans campaigned against @entity115 's policies in @entity116			0
@entity30 officials such as former vice president @entity118 said that @entity115 was not unleashing enough force against the @entity120 and leaving @entity34 troops in a quagmire			0
in 1978 , @entity30 railed against president @entity123 for his alleged weakness in foreign policy , claiming that he gave away too much in the @entity126 and that he was pursuing a dangerous policy of d√©tente with the @entity129			1
in 1982 , @entity5 , who were generally focused on the recession , also spoke in favor of a nuclear freeze and warned that president @entity135 's embrace of the military was bringing the nation close to war			0
more recently , republicans blasted @entity5 in 2002 for being weak on defense after having not supported the administration 's homeland security bill			0
and in 2006 , @entity5 candidates returned the favor by criticizing the president 's war in @entity84 as a reckless , unnecessary and extremely costly operation that had actually undermined the war on terrorism			0
@entity150 : @entity22 , @entity151 and @entity35 while foreign policy carried different levels of weight in these midterms , in some of these contests , such as 1966 and 2006 , the administration 's actions overseas dismayed voters			1
will foreign policy play a factor in the 2014 midterms ? it is unlikely that it will be a major issue but there are ways it could have an indirect effect on the ballot box and cause trouble for @entity5 when @entity34 turn out to vote			1
at the most immediate level , the foreign policy controversy has already distracted the news media from other kinds of stories upon which congressional democrats were hoping to focus			1
the foreign policy controversy intensified just as there was evidence that the economy was picking up steam and that the @entity2 's health care program was gaining strength			1
both signs of accomplishment were put on the back burner , overshadowed by the @entity22 debate			1
the stories also feed the perception of some voters who feel that @entity5 have not done a good job managing government			0
this is a @entity194 that once prided itself on competence			0
@entity2 , a well - educated politician who surrounded himself with bright staff , vowed to avoid the kind of mismanagement that had been on display with @entity200 during president @entity202 's term			2
but that reputation has slowly been undercut , especially after the botched health care website rollout and the @entity206 scandal			0
opinion : @entity22 deal was an ugly decision but right some of the coverage of the foreign policy , including recent reports on how the deal with the @entity26 was handled , have played into these kinds of criticism			1
the @entity217 published a lengthy piece about the diminishing returns that @entity2 was able to obtain over the past several years in exchange for the release of the @entity26 5 and evidence of how his team had mishandled the process			2
the @entity226 deal is also becoming a way to question the veracity of @entity5 promises			0
members of @entity73 , in both parties , have alleged that @entity2 violated the law by ignoring a federal statute that says the president must inform @entity73 one month before such a deal is completed			2
they have said he is acting exactly like @entity202 , whom he had accused of discounting legislative intent through sweeping notions of executive power			0
the foreign policy debate puts into focus the argument that @entity2 , as well as the party he leads , lacks a bold vision			1
this is something that has even frustrated many @entity5 who feel that the president is too much of pragmatist and not enough of a visionary			0
the speech at @entity58 fell flat for some @entity34 because it almost seemed focus on excusing what he could n't do rather outlining what he wants to do			0
during his visit to the @entity257 , the president explained his outlook on foreign policy by saying , " you hit singles , you hit doubles ; every once in a while you may be able to hit a home run			1
" the debate over foreign policy helps republicans by riling up the party 's base at an opportune time , five months before the election , while at the same time dispiriting the @entity5			1
yes , voters are thinking primarily about how they 're faring in today 's economy , but on the margins , their perception of their local candidate 's views on foreign policy could be a factor in november			1
opinion : how big a risk are former @entity282 prisoners ?			0

@entity284 : criticism of @entity2 foreign policy has been on the increase
@entity9 's book mentions her *disagreement* with @entity2 on @entity13 rebels
he says debate over prisoner swap for sgt. @entity22 adds to the controversy
@entity284 says foreign policy can have effect on midterms , usually dominated by economic issues
