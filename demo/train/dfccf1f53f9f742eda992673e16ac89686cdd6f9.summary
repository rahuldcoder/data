-- for @entity2 , revenge has been both sweet and sonorous			1
when music schools refused to admit him because he could not read music , he went to a design school instead — and invented a way to make melodies not only without sheet music , but without traditional instruments either			1
" it feels good , " he says			0
" i like playing music , i like doing design and now designing musical instruments and playing your own design — it 's kind of the ultimate happiness			1
in the end everybody can just play music that wants to play music and not have to learn a complex code			2
" when @entity2 enrolled at the @entity22 he began to play around with electronic sensors that would allow musicians to control sound using only the movement of their own bodies			1
one of his tutors encouraged him to look at the way people move when they dance and incorporate those movements into his design			2
read this : is this the world 's weirdest instrument ? the result is a collection of five instruments , which @entity2 calls sound on intuition : a sensor that measures the position of the musician 's hand , raising and lowering the pitch of the note with the rise and fall of the hand a collar that fits around the finger and converts tapping , bending and stretching movements into sound a heart rate monitor that produces rhythms based on the beating of the musician 's heart a strap that wraps around the musician 's foot and produces the sound of a bass drum in time with his or her foot - tapping a scanner that reads lines or dots drawn by the musician and represents them musically : " if you want to have a sound that goes up and down , " @entity71 says , " you just draw a line that goes up and down			1
" although electronic music is nothing new , @entity2 says that abandoning instruments altogether in favor of computer programs can take some of the joy out of making music			1
" now everybody sits behind his computer and just types in commands to create a sound , but it 's not that fun anymore , " he says			2
" if we have instruments that you can move and kind of play the computer in a fun way , i think making music is more fun			2
" @entity95 , a @entity96 film director and designer of the radically simple @entity98 , praised the intuitive interface and said that he could imagine the approach spreading to other art forms			2
" i really like it , " he says			0
" i think it could be the future in everything , even with computers and with graphic programs , even film			0
design is evolution or devolution			0
devolving of design is something that i really like — you know , making products simple again			0
" @entity95 urged @entity2 to keep developing and improving his design until it was ready for a wider audience			1
" as long as his heart is in it and he keeps his heart in it then he will succeed , " @entity95 says			0
read this : the brave new world of electric paint since @entity2 had little experience working with electronics , he looked for ways of adapting sensors and other devices that were already on the market -- rather than starting from scratch			1
he was pleased to see that this adaptive approach was then adopted by the people who used his prototype , some of whom found new and unexpected uses for the device			0
" it started as a music instrument project , but when i got to finish it , it opened up a lot more doors , " he says			1
" for example a woman came up to me and she said to me : ' this would be perfect for autistic children			0
autistic children would play with this for hours because they 'd feel that the instrument understands them and they do n't have to learn to play it			0
' " for @entity153 , that would be the ultimate vindication			0
the music schools that rejected him may not have seen his potential , but his musical instruments could help other to unleash theirs .			1

sound on intuition by designer @entity2 turns your body into a musical instrument
sensors *attach* to your hands , feet and heart to produce music that *responds* to movement
his creation allows people of any *background* or *skill* - base to make music
