@entity0 , @entity1 -- four portraits of @entity4 by pop artist @entity5 have gone on display at her home , @entity0 , for the first time as part of an exhibition of official images of the monarch marking the end of her @entity14 year			1
@entity5 's series of sparkling " diamond - dusted " portraits of the @entity4 was acquired earlier this year to mark the @entity14			1
royal librarian @entity17 told @entity2 they were the " most iconic " images in the exhibition , " @entity4 : portraits of a @entity21 , " which features pictures , paintings and sculptures by some of the world 's best - known artists and photographers			1
@entity5 , who once claimed he wanted to be " as famous as the @entity4 , " used a 10 - year - old official portrait of @entity4 , by royal photographer @entity30 , to create the four screenprints for his " reigning @entity33 " series in 1985			1
" what @entity5 did was he grabbed a pre-existing image of the @entity4 and wiped it clean , so what you 're left with is the outline , with the tiara , " @entity17 told @entity2			2
" then he played around with colors , and lighting , and ' diamond dust ' [ cut glass ] , really treating the likeness as an icon			0
" capturing a queen : images of @entity4 @entity4 's global significance -- as head of the @entity50 -- is hinted at by the number of works by international photographers and artists in the exhibition : @entity57 @entity56 , @entity59 @entity58 , @entity61 @entity60 and @entity63 @entity62 , among others			1
so which , of the millions of pictures of the monarch , will be the one which is remembered long after her reign , the defining image of @entity4 , who @entity17 says is " probably the most photographed person in the world " ? with so many to choose from , she says it is hard to be sure			0
" i suspect in this age of photography , that it will be a photograph , " said @entity17			0
" probably one of the incredibly glamorous photographs taken by @entity79			0
" but having said that , it could be one of the photographs taken very early in her reign , between the accession and the coronation , by @entity85 , because they were then reproduced on coinage and stamps , again and again			0
" " or it could be the @entity5			0
who knows ? " " the queen : portraits of a @entity21 " is on at @entity0 until june 9 , 2013 .			2
