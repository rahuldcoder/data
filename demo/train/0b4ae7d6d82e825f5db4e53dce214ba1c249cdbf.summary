@entity3 never told it about the free items			2
" we still have quite a few left if @entity6 needs those , " @entity15 said			2
" but we did find out , we did ask @entity6 , ' do you want these ? ' they said , ' no , we do n't need them			2
' so we offered them to the other states			0
" a @entity1 investigation revealed last week that @entity3 gave away 121 truckloads of material the agency amassed after 2005 's @entity28			1
the material was declared surplus property and offered to federal and state agencies -- including @entity6 , where groups working to resettle hurricane victims say the supplies are still needed			1
@entity15 told @entity1 's " @entity35 " his agency distributed more than 90,000 " living kits " to people in @entity6 whose homes were destroyed or damaged by @entity28			1
the kits included cleaning supplies , mops , brooms , pots and pans			0
after @entity1 reported on the giveaway , @entity6 officials asked that the supplies be redirected to the state , which originally passed on them			1
@entity51 , director of the @entity6 's @entity52 , told @entity1 he was unaware @entity28 victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office			1
sen. @entity57 of @entity6 , an outspoken critic of @entity3 's response to the hurricane , told @entity1 the supply giveaway was " just a shame			1
" " it 's just another example of the failings of the federal bureaucracy , " said @entity57 , who wrote homeland security secretary @entity62 last week to request an explanation			2
" we 're still trying to fix it			0
it 's going to take a lot more work			0
" @entity15 said much of the stockpile included " things we do n't normally store -- refrigerators , stoves , coolers , diapers , things like that			0
" @entity82 , meanwhile , were requesting those items , he said			0
" it did n't make any sense for @entity3 to sit on this much stuff and supplies we normally do n't even keep			1
we have plenty of supplies in place if we have another disaster			0
we can duplicate that type of commodities and get them for people in need , " he said			0
the agency 's chief spokesman , @entity97 , had declined a request for an on - camera interview and told @entity1 the giveaway was " not news			2
" @entity15 said the story " just really missed the mark " -- that the supplies given away were not exclusively for @entity28 victims , but were " donated from disasters all around the entire country			1
" but e-mails from @entity110 and from the @entity111 , which manages federal property , contradict @entity15 's account			2
in an e-mail sent in april , @entity110 told @entity1 " in many cases , items were purchased in the field by @entity3			1
" and in a phone interview with @entity1 , @entity110 said , " that is property that was purchased in response to @entity28			1
we purchased most of that equipment because of the catastrophic nature of that disaster			0
" @entity111 spokeswoman @entity126 wrote the supplies given away were " surplus from the @entity28 and [ hurricane ] @entity130 disasters ... some purchased by @entity3 , some donated by foreign countries and federal government agencies			1
" @entity110 said @entity3 's storage costs were running more than $ 1 million a year , and that @entity111 officials wanted to tear down the @entity136 , @entity137 , warehouses in which the stockpiles were being kept			0
@entity1 's @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
