@entity0 -- @entity4 to pay $ 1.5 billion over @entity6 manipulation , @entity3 paid $ 1.92 billion for failing to stop money laundering , @entity8 paid $ 667 million , @entity9 , $ 619 million , @entity10 , $ 536 million , @entity2 amro $ 500 million and the list goes on and on			0
while the number of fines imposed on banks has remained constant over the past 10 years , the value of fines has grown considerably faster than inflation			1
one has to ask , therefore : is this the new norm ? are @entity21 regulators using financial penalties as a method of indirect regulations ? and will it actually work ? @entity21 regulators have unique views about how to run a banking industry , views that often differ from their global counterparts			1
the latter , by and large , have a hands - off approach to an industry that is globally focused			0
the @entity21 has tried , on countless instances , to influence global regulations			1
but it has been to no avail			0
the financial services market outside the @entity21 is bigger than the domestic market			1
so , if @entity38 or @entity39 decides on its own path , the @entity21 has very little power to stop it			2
it 's therefore not unreasonable that the @entity21 regulators impose different oversight on foreign banks than domestic equivalents			1
this is likely the reason we 've seen fines of considerably higher value imposed on non- @entity21 banks for similar infractions			1
read more : @entity53 still has mountain to climb sure , some @entity21 banks have seen fines in the hundreds of millions : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 come to mind			1
but the vast majority of @entity21 - based fines are small			1
you would be forgiven for thinking this is discrimination			0
it 's really indirect regulation			0
if a @entity21 bank breaks rules , it is relatively easy for @entity21 regulators to march into their offices , take all the material they need for an investigation and then dictate policy for the bank			1
in the case of a foreign operation , they ca n't do that			0
the @entity21 authorities have no rights to material held in foreign offices			2
further , once funds leave the @entity21 , they are often irretrievable without political help			2
this is the reason why global financial services regulations are necessary and inevitable , although decades away			1
by fining at the billion dollar level , banks wishing to operate within the @entity21 will be encouraged to be far more carefully than domestic operations			2
this is exactly what the @entity21 regulators want			1
banks find it difficult to operate in the @entity21 because they often have to adhere to rules that are diametrically opposed to rules in their home countries			2
money laundering is a great example			0
the @entity21 basically asks banks to assume @entity102 and @entity102 organizations are guilty until proven innocent , while the rest of the world wants banks to assume @entity102 are innocent until proven guilty			1
this means global banks have to operate an infrastructure for @entity21 rules and a second infrastructure for the rules of other regulators			1
the costs are high and the risks are many -- and banks simply do n't want to do it			0
in the end , it 's not going to work			0
the @entity21 can fine @entity3 or @entity4 all they want , these two banks are incredibly strong and can easily afford it			2
but what about troubled banks , or ones like government - owned @entity124 ? if they were to levy the same fines for these banks they could put them out of business			2
if a bank of @entity124 's size went under , it could cause economic instability in its home country			0
the government would have to get involved			0
and fining them a lesser amount for the same infraction would not go down well with @entity3 or @entity4 who would most certainly send a thousand lawyers to @entity142 to ask why they were discriminated against			0
after all , you get a $ 100 fine for going 20 miles over the speed limit if driving a @entity146 or a @entity147			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

number of fines imposed on banks has remained constant for a decade , but fines ' value has grown faster than inflation

@entity21 regulators have unique views on how to run banking and have tried to influence global regulations
@entity21 wants banks to assume @entity102 are guilty until proven innocent , rest of the world wants the opposite , @entity150 writes
