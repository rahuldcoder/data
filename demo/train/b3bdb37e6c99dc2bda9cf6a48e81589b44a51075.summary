@entity0 -- get in line , have your money ready and move to your extreme left -- @entity6 , " the @entity6 , " is back			1
he reopened his famed soup store tuesday in @entity9			1
@entity10 and his @entity6 first rose to fame after he was caricatured in the long - running @entity12 " @entity13 " as the " @entity14 , " a cranky and demanding soup - stand cook who bellowed " no soup for you ! " to customers who did n't follow his strict rules for ordering			1
@entity10 , who first opened his shop in 1984 , closed the store six years ago , but kept the lease to pursue franchise opportunities and a line of frozen soups with the @entity6 brand			1
loyalty to the brand apparently has not faltered			2
@entity31 soup fans lined up around the block tuesday during @entity0 's steamy heat wave to get a taste			2
@entity35 secured the first spot in line by getting to the storefront at 5 a.m. " i love @entity40			0
and i ca n't wait for that first bowl of soup , " said @entity35 , who chose chicken vegetable			0
@entity44 , also in the line , said he did n't care if it was 90 degrees or 90 below outside -- he would wait for his favorite soup , the lobster bisque			0
" it 's like there 's an entire lobster in the cup			0
you open up the top and a claw comes out and strangles your taste buds			0
it 's so special , " @entity44 said			0
chef @entity59 , who mentored with @entity10 , was at the store a day before its opening , helping to set things up			1
" we are keeping the original recipes and adding more to the menu , " @entity59 said			0
although @entity10 did n't stop by for opening , @entity59 said he 's expected to make sporadic appearances			1
according to the " @entity13 " web site , @entity10 was at first unhappy with the publicity from the " @entity14 " episode and was quoted as saying he threatened to " smack " comedian @entity73 's face			1
@entity73 , whose title character was banned during the " @entity14 " episode , declined to comment on the store 's reopening			2
@entity1 's @entity77 contributed to this report .			0
