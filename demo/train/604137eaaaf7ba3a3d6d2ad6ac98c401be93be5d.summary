-- despite below - freezing temperatures , divers searched two bodies of water in central @entity5 on friday , looking for signs of a toddler last seen more than seven weeks ago			1
authorities said there was no initial indication that friday 's search led to the discovery of anything related to @entity15 ' disappearance			1
they added that more searches could be forthcoming			2
" if we do n't find anything that can be attributed to @entity15 today , we 'll be back again some other day -- maybe someplace else , " said lt. @entity18 of the @entity19			1
@entity15 's father , @entity21 , told police he put his then - 20 - month - old daughter to bed at 8 p.m. december 16 in the first - floor bedroom of their @entity27 , @entity5 , home			1
he called police the next morning , just before 9 a.m. , to report her missing			2
police have said the three adults in the home that night told them " someone snuck into the house , went into the bedroom where @entity15 was sleeping , and no one heard or saw anything			1
" yet authorities said days ago -- and @entity5 @entity41 spokesman @entity40 reiterated friday -- that there is no evidence of any break - in or kidnapping			1
" we still think they know more than what they 've told us , " @entity46 said friday			0
" we have grave doubts that an abduction ever took place there			0
" no arrests have been made related to @entity15 's disappearance , and no one has been identified as a suspect			1
nor has there been any public indication of where the girl may be , with @entity46 saying authorities are branching out to cover as much area as possible in a hunt for clues			0
friday 's search of part of the @entity69 , near the @entity70 , and @entity71 , near the @entity73 bridge , is part of that effort			0
both bodies of water had been looked at before , though @entity18 noted that the divers returned because " we did n't search them to the amount that we wanted to last time			1
" he explained that inclement weather prompted divers to twice cancel new searches			1
conditions were better friday , though the area the divers could safely cover was still restricted by daytime temperatures that were below freezing			0
" it 's not like diving down in the @entity92 , " @entity18 said , noting that divers are underwater for only about 20 minutes at a time			2
" it 's 20 degrees out there , and the water is freezing			2
so it just takes time			0
plus , it 's dark			0
" testing on blood found in the basement of @entity15 's home determined that some of it belonged to the girl , @entity46 said sunday			1
a website created by @entity15 's family disclosed the police findings in a posting that same day , saying investigators told them the blood found was " more ... than a small cut would produce			2
" earlier sunday , @entity46 said that while some of the blood found " was visible to the naked eye , some was n't			0
" @entity21 , @entity15 's father , sleeps in the basement of the home , which is owned by his mother			1
he has said that he would never do anything to harm his daughter			0
" i have to believe that @entity15 is with somebody , and i just want that person to find the courage to do the right thing and find a way to return her safely , " he said in a statement issued soon after the girl was reported missing			1
when asked friday about communication between authorities and @entity15 's family , @entity46 said , " there has been contact this week , and we hope that contact will continue			2
" the state spokesman noted authorities have received more than 700 tips , admitting that the pace has slowed down in recent days			0
the fears of a worst case scenario are increasing , as time passes , he acknowledged			0
" it 's been 48 days , and our concern grows every day , " @entity46 said			0
" but we remain hopeful that we 're going to find her			0
