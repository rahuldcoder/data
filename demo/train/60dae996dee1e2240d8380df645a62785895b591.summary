editor 's note : @entity2 is director of the @entity3 for @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 at the @entity8			1
@entity2 has written for journals including @entity10 , @entity4 , the @entity11 and the @entity12			1
after graduating from medical school , @entity2 earned his masters in @entity15 at the @entity16 and his ph.d. in @entity18 from @entity19			1
dr. @entity2 urges @entity20 to get tested for @entity4			1
@entity21 , @entity22 ( @entity23 ) -- every 9Â½ minutes someone 's brother , mother , sister , father , or neighbor becomes infected with @entity4 in the @entity20			2
that 's 56,000 people every year			2
but there 's something we can all do to help protect ourselves and our partners from this disease -- get tested for @entity4			1
in the fight against @entity4 , i can tell you that few things are more important than testing			1
it 's an essential step in reducing the number of new hiv infections and extending the lives of those who are infected			1
put simply , hiv testing saves lives			1
as a @entity8 official , i 've spoken with hundreds of people who have made the decision to get tested			1
many described the relief they felt when they found out they were @entity4 - negative			1
thanks to the @entity4 test , they could take steps to make sure they and their partners stay that way			0
i 've also met people who found out they were @entity4 - positive			1
although initially worried about their diagnosis and their future , they were thankful they had their infection diagnosed early , and were able to live long , healthy and productive lives with @entity4			2
they had the knowledge and will to protect their partners from infection , or to prevent their infants from becoming @entity4 infected			0
i recently met one young woman who learned about her @entity4 infection after being diagnosed during routine hiv testing in pregnancy			1
by getting tested early , and having access to effective treatment , her child was born without @entity4 , and she now has two healthy children			2
she is a living testament that life does not stop with this disease			0
instead , knowledge of her @entity4 status along with effective treatment and care has given her the freedom , resolve and respect to make choices to protect her life and the lives of those she loves			2
yet today , not everyone has benefited from knowing their @entity4 status			0
far too many individuals with @entity4 do n't know that they 're infected			0
@entity8 estimates that one in five people with @entity4 in the @entity20 is unaware of being infected			0
that 's more than 200,000 @entity20 who may be transmitting the virus to others without knowing it , and who ca n't take advantage of @entity4 treatments that could prolong and improve the quality of their lives			1
as we mark @entity108 on saturday , i strongly encourage all @entity20 to get tested for @entity4			2
at @entity8 , our goal is to make hiv testing as routine as a blood pressure check			1
@entity4 testing has never been quicker , easier or more accessible			2
in fact , with rapid hiv tests , results can be available in as little as 20 minutes , and tests can be given in your doctor 's office or other locations in your community , such as churches and college campuses			2
to ensure that all @entity20 know their @entity4 status , @entity8 recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for @entity4 as part of routine medical care -- regardless of their perceived risk for infection			1
@entity8 also recommends that those at increased risk , such as sexually active gay and bisexual men , get tested at least annually			2
we are also working with our partners to bring hiv testing services directly to communities across the nation			1
increased hiv testing will make it possible to significantly reduce the number of new infections			1
research indicates the majority of new sexually transmitted @entity4 infections are transmitted by people who do not know they are @entity4 - infected			2
studies also show that most people who test hiv - positive take steps to protect their partners from infection			1
nearly 30 years after the start of the epidemic , far too many people continue to be diagnosed late in the course of their infection			0
too many times , i 've heard stories from people who went to the emergency room after a few days of flu - like symptoms			0
once there , doctors conduct tests and inform them they have both pneumonia and @entity4			0
they never knew they were @entity4 infected , and yet they had the virus for years			0
in fact , data released today show that nearly 40 percent of people develop @entity4 within just a year of being diagnosed with @entity4			0
many of these people could have stayed healthier if they were diagnosed with @entity4 and began drug treatment much earlier			0
anti-retroviral treatment can lower the amount of the virus in the blood , slowing progression from @entity4 to @entity4			0
we must remember that @entity4 still kills in this country -- more than 14,000 people die every year			0
yet we have the tools to diagnose an hiv infection early , to begin life - prolonging treatments to prevent progression to @entity4 , and to ensure a strong quality of life for @entity4 - infected people			1
but without a test , there is no diagnosis -- and no treatment			0
the fight against @entity4 here at home is far from over			0
but too many mistakenly believe that @entity4 in the @entity20 is no longer a serious problem			0
in fact , a recent survey by the @entity198 found a troubling decline in awareness and concern about the domestic hiv / aids crisis , in the general population and among those at greatest risk			2
to help combat this complacency , the @entity207 recently joined @entity8 and the rest of the @entity20 @entity210 to announce a new communication campaign , " @entity212			0
" the campaign is working on a number of fronts to refocus national attention on the @entity20 epidemic , and to increase the number of @entity20 who get tested for @entity4			1
although hiv / aids continues to pose a serious threat to the nation 's health , hiv testing is a powerful weapon against the disease			1
by increasing the number of people who know their @entity4 status , we can decrease the number of new hiv infections , and help save thousands of lives			1
what you do n't know can hurt you			0
in fact , it can kill you			0
but a simple test could change your fate and the fate of others			0
that 's why today i urge all @entity20 to take the test -- and take control			0
to learn more about @entity4 and where you can receive a confidential @entity4 test , visit hivtest.org , call 800 - @entity8 - info , or text your zip code to " know it " ( 566948 )			0

@entity2 : testing is essential to reducing the number of new hiv infections
many who get tested are relieved when they find out they are negative after all
those who are positive can prolong their lives and ensure the health of loved ones
