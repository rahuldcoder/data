-- @entity1 has clarified that the next generation of its @entity3 , the @entity4 , will not be able to browse the internet without a @entity7 connection			1
users will still be able to use @entity4 to sync book and document purchases , but anything beyond @entity12 will be off - limits			2
browsing was ( and still is ) an experimental feature on the last iteration of the @entity3 , now known as the @entity17			0
the experiment appears to have failed as far as @entity1 is concerned , as it will restrict the 3g access of the @entity4 to browsing @entity12 and downloading books and periodicals			1
the @entity4 's webpage does not directly note this restriction , stating only that it has " free 3g wireless " that " works globally , " but a post in the official @entity1 forums states that " experimental web browsing ( outside of @entity12 ) on @entity4 is only available over @entity7			2
" since @entity1 subsidizes all @entity3 owners ' 3g use , the company may have determined the model is n't cost - effective enough to support the use of the entire @entity5			0
the 3g version of the @entity4 with special offers costs $ 149 , 50 percent more than the $ 99 @entity7 version , so this restriction may make the jump from @entity7 to @entity38 much harder for customers to justify when both models become available november 21			1
the announcement does n't affect the new @entity42 announced last week and due for launch november 15 , since it is @entity7 - only			0
the @entity17 , while it is still available , will continue to have unfettered internet access through the experimental browser			1
we asked @entity1 for confirmation of this policy , but have not received a response as of yet			0

the new @entity4 will have limited access to the internet
the 3g version of the @entity4 with special offers costs $ 149
the @entity17 will continue to have unfettered internet access
