@entity0 -- i recently returned to @entity0 from the latest round of @entity5 climate talks in @entity6 , @entity7 , and found this city of canals covered in snow			1
it was a beautiful sight			0
yet rather than filling me with joy , it caused me concern			0
over the past few years , climate - change skeptics have repeatedly used cold snaps as proof that our planet is not heating up			1
this argument ignores @entity22 's recent analysis of 2010 as the warmest year on record and the @entity25 's pronouncement of the first decade of this century as the hottest since records began			1
global warming does not simply mean that temperatures are always climbing			1
what it does mean is that although our planet is steadily heating up , a delicate set of climatic imbalances creates an increase in extreme weather events			2
these may include both dramatic heat spells and powerful snowstorms , such as those that have blanketed parts of @entity41 not used to seeing such weather -- as well as the more southerly reaches of the @entity44 of the @entity45 most scientists tell us that we must dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions if we are to avert catastrophic climate change			1
to do this , it will be necessary to mobilize people around the globe who are not yet concerned about the issue			0
but if the scientific evidence can be buried , in the eyes of some , by a single heavy snowfall , then we must have new strategies that generate interest in this complex issue and sustain public and political support for action			0
@entity65 - winning cartoonist @entity64 may have hit upon something with a cartoon he drew for last year 's climate talks in @entity69 , @entity70			1
it shows a scientist addressing a large audience at a climate summit			2
a spectator at the left side of the panel asks his neighbor : " what if it 's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing ? " the answer emerges on the right side of the panel where the following list appears on a chalkboard : energy independence , preserve rainforest , sustainability , green jobs , livable cities , renewables , clean water and air , healthy children , etc. , etc. there is indeed something for almost everyone in climate protection			1
a small nonprofit group called the @entity102 ran with this idea in 2007			0
it sponsored a yearlong competition between six towns in @entity107 with the goal of getting them to lower carbon emissions			0
they did this by reducing their energy consumption and accepting renewable sources of energy			2
a study had shown that a majority of residents in that region believed either that climate change was a hoax or that recent dramatic weather events were simply the result of natural climate cycles			1
organizers decided to highlight the more immediate benefits of cutting carbon emissions , including energy independence , development of the local economy and financial savings			1
the @entity133 reported in october that the project 's strategy seems to have worked			0
in a year , the article read , " energy use in the towns declined as much as 5 percent relative to other areas -- a giant step in the world of energy conservation , where a program that yields a 1.5 percent decline is considered successful			1
" most of the world 's major religions also offer reasons to engage in climate protection			2
because taking care of the poor and needy ( often disproportionately affected by climate - related disasters ) and protecting @entity155 's planet are tenets of most of the world 's major faith - based organizations , environmental protection is commonly becoming part of what they preach			2
some @entity164 and @entity165 groups , for example , are working on special product labeling that would inform consumers about environmental impacts of the items being purchased			0
similarly , around the globe , diverse organizations -- including trade unions , churches , non-governmental organizations and governments -- are coming together to find solutions to climate change			1
in 2010 , the fossil fuel industry offered , albeit by accident , one of the greatest motivations to take action on global warming			1
@entity185 's @entity184 resulted in the death of 11 rig workers ; local economies suffered deeply , and wildlife in the region could take decades to recover			0
the continued disintegration of public trust in government and business policy and procedures surrounding the disaster will , justifiably , have repercussions for a long time to come			0
speaking with a @entity200 friend , i commented that the snow -- which has caused great travel difficulties around @entity41 -- was at least a wonderful thing for children , who are out in force making snowmen			2
" yes , " he replied , but when i was growing up , winters were so cold the canals would freeze over every year , and we could skate on them			0
last year was the first time this happened again in over a decade			0
the world is no longer as we knew it			0
it is not possible to backtrack on climate change			1
it is , however , still within our power to help preserve our planet for future generations			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 said @entity0 snow *delightful* , but he *feared* it would fuel global warming denial
he says @entity22 analysis named 2010 the warmest year on record
@entity224 : even those who doubt climate change can take actions that benefit them and the planet
for skeptics , case must be made in terms of better health , water , energy independence
