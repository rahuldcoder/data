one of the world 's greatest fashion designers , @entity0 has helped blaze a trail for @entity4 over the last three decades			1
@entity0 brought masculine styles to the catwalk , rejecting traditional ideas of sexiness			1
he brought geometric minimalism to the catwalk in the late 1970 's while other designers focused on flamboyance , and if his name and clothing has become a brand over the last 30 years , for the man himself , it is always " creation first "			0
" i had no intention of working in the mainstream and i 've stated my objection against the main currents of fashion for the last 27 years , " he told @entity20			2
his firm standpoint on style , and his designs , has brought popularity with an international chain of clothing outlets and the courting of celebrities and companies -- he designed @entity36 's wardrobe for his latest world tour and has collaborated with @entity38 to produce the y - 3 street wear range			1
@entity40 toured one of his ateliers and showrooms in @entity44 , before moving to @entity45 for @entity46 , where @entity0 opened the doors to a model - casting session for the first time			1
while successful , his design house is far removed from the mega-brands of some labels such as @entity53 or @entity54 , and he has stuck to his ethos throughout			0
" i have no intention to deal with a market first and put my creation into it			0
i create my clothes at will and that will change the market -- that 's what i hope to see			0
" independent fashion houses are in an extreme minority			2
most fashion makers have to sell accessories , there are only one or two or three that are successful just selling clothes			2
this is the era that clothes can not sell			0
" known for his distinctive black , minimalist style , he discussed how he perceives his own impact on fashion and his unique philosophy : " civilized humans must wear monochrome			1
there is a minimum etiquette of fashion that you must not upset other people 's vision			0
it is wrong to think that standing out is a good thing			0
" " i prefer to be behind the scenes -- that to me is a fashion designer			1
" and behind the scenes , @entity0 practices karate to relax -- at black belt level , or course -- and recreating action through his designs			1
" i 'm very much interested in cutting , making forms , silhouettes , making motion ; that 's why i forget the color			0
