@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 has lambasted @entity5 's @entity4 for the pit - lane accident that ended both of their races at the @entity11 @entity10			1
@entity12 's @entity3 is far from happy after @entity4 pushed him out of the @entity11 @entity10			1
@entity4 's @entity5 rammed into the back of world champion @entity3 's @entity12 as the @entity14 and @entity15 , the race 's eventual winner , were waiting at a red light after the safety car was forced into action on lap 17			1
@entity3 , while claiming not to be angry , was clearly far from impressed			2
" there 's not much i can say			0
my race was ruined by @entity4 's mistake			1
" obviously , anyone can make mistakes , as i did two weeks ago in @entity27 , but it 's one thing to make a mistake at 200 hundred [ miles ] per hour but another to hit a car stopped at a red light			1
" i 'm not angry because that does n't achieve anything and does not change my result			0
i am unhappy because i had a great chance of winning			0
" @entity3 , who has failed to score points in the previous two races , said he had to start winning again			2
" there is still a long way to go in the championship and it is still very close and we have everything we need to regain the ground we have lost			0
" @entity12 team sporting director @entity45 said @entity4 had made a " serious mistake			2
" " i think the penalty imposed by the @entity48 [ @entity4 was given a 10 - place grid penalty for the @entity50 @entity10 at @entity51 ] is in line with it , even if it does not restore what was a lost opportunity for us			1
" @entity3 was in an excellent position to fight for the win " @entity4 , for his part , was apologetic			1
" i do n't know what happened to be honest , " @entity4 said			1
" i was comfortably in the lead , it was looking like an easy win			0
then i went in for the pit stop			0
it was not a good stop and i saw the two guys in front of me battling in the pit lane			2
" i saw the red light but by that time it was a bit late			1
it was not exactly a racing incident as such , it was unfortunate			0
it was one of those things			0
it is different to if you crash into the wall and you are angry			0
it is not like that			0
i apologize to @entity3 for ruining his race			2
