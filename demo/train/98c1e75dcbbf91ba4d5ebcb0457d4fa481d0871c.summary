@entity0 -- @entity3 's ground incursion into @entity0 , which it says is intended to destroy @entity6 militants ' tunnels and stop rocket fire into @entity0 , has entered its fifth day with the death toll mounting on both sides and @entity11 secretary of state @entity10 arriving in @entity12			1
@entity1 's @entity13 , a veteran @entity14 correspondent , puts the incursion into perspective			1
how does this incursion compare to previous ones by @entity3 into @entity0 , in terms of military force ? unlike 2008/09 , this incursion seems to be focused on areas with high concentrations of people , initially focusing on the @entity0 neighborhood of @entity24			2
in ' 08/09 the focus was on areas where rockets were being fired , which were typically away from highly populated communities			0
and of course at this stage , it 's unclear how many @entity6 casualties there have been in these locations			0
the people have been warned by the @entity3 to leave these areas with phone messages , but while many have left , a significant proportion has stayed behind			0
my impression is that @entity3 has mobilized a much larger military force than in 2008/09 and in 2012			2
this is part of the picture of the @entity3 going into heavily populated areas -- which is a much more dangerous operation , as can be seen by the deaths of at least 13 @entity3 soldiers on sunday			0
is @entity3 likely to achieve its objective of destroying the tunnels , and stopping the rocket strikes ? so far , @entity3 has n't been wildly successful in its stated mission			0
since this started , @entity52 has been using tunnels in an attempt to ambush and capture soldiers and continues to fire rockets at @entity3 , although the number fired has gone down			1
what we see is that as @entity3 's capabilities have changed , so have @entity52 '			1
whenever @entity3 comes up with new tactics , @entity52 and other factions seem to find new ways to counter them , such as by using longer - range rockets to fire at @entity3 , for example			1
what is significant now is that @entity52 fighters appear to be better trained , with a new set of skills that i do n't think @entity3 anticipated			1
one @entity3 soldier who came out of @entity24 was quoted in an @entity3 publication that @entity52 is fighting like @entity74 , which waged a successful guerrilla war against @entity3 's occupation in the 1980s and 1990s , and inflicted high casualties on @entity3 forces during the 2006 war between @entity74 and @entity3 in @entity80			1
the last serious street fighting i saw in @entity0 was in early 2008 , and it was almost like it was " amateur hour , " with fighters in @entity0 parading around with their weapons but not really able to stop the @entity3 forces			0
now it appears they 've learned they must keep a much lower profile			0
they 've developed what could be called commando tactics , and are taking full advantage of their knowledge of their turf			0
how long do you believe this incursion will last ? how soon before it realistically is better described as a war ? this is now a war , in my modest opinion -- it 's gone beyond a mere incursion			0
@entity52 shows no sign of backing down , and did n't jump at @entity12 's cease - fire proposal			1
they want to show that they 're a military force to be reckoned with , and are in it for the long run			0
@entity3 's defense minister said it would take two or three days to destroy the tunnels			2
if this crisis is to end soon , @entity3 will have to pull back and @entity52 needs to stop firing rockets			1
in @entity52 ' opinion , they have achieved one of their objectives , which is to give @entity3 a bloody nose			1
they claim to have captured an @entity3 soldier -- as yet this is unconfirmed -- but if true , it would be a huge feather in their cap , in their own terms			2
when @entity3 soldier @entity124 was captured by @entity52 in a june 2006 raid near the @entity3 - @entity0 border , it took five years before he was freed , in exchange for more than 1,000 @entity6 prisoners -- so , if true , this will be a huge bargaining chip for @entity52			1
will the death toll already suffered by @entity3 have a serious impact on public opinion in @entity3 ? @entity3 are used to this sort of death toll from @entity74 , but not from @entity52			1
i was on the streets of @entity0 on sunday night , when @entity6 celebrated the claims that an @entity3 soldier had been captured			2
shortly afterwards , the guns on @entity3 navy boats opened up			0
the immediate conclusion of everyone in the street was that this was @entity3 's response to the capture of one of its soldiers			2
how much effect will the pressure / condemnation from the @entity149 ( and in the off - mic remarks from @entity11 secretary of state @entity10 ) have ? i believe the @entity149 remarks will have no effect in @entity0			2
there is a perception there that the @entity149 " talks but does n't walk " -- it 's toothless in other words			0
@entity52 realizes it has few friends in the outside world			0
the remarks of the @entity165 last week though will not go down well in @entity3 , i believe			0
and the comments of @entity10 on sunday -- which left some wondering whether he was criticizing @entity3 assurances that its ground offensive in @entity0 would be limited -- indicate @entity11 patience may be wearing thin			1
after one of his deputies mentioned the latest number of @entity6 casualties , @entity10 was heard to say , " it 's a hell of a pinpoint operation			0
" it is estimated that 70 % of the more than 500 palestinians killed in @entity3 's assault have been civilians			0
@entity180 has tied itself to @entity3 , and that country 's right to self - defense , therefore the @entity11 is going to feel some responsibility			1
@entity11 support @entity3 rhetorically , but this high @entity6 death toll is very problematic for the @entity186 is why @entity10 may be feeling uncomfortable -- he spent almost a year trying to forge a @entity14 peace deal , and what 's he got to show for it now ? @entity10 seeks @entity0 cease - fire amid rising casualties @entity191 in @entity192 contributed to this report .			1

@entity1 's @entity13 says @entity52 is a stronger force this time
it has adopted commando - like tactics , he says
there was *cheering* at reports of an @entity3 solider captured
@entity11 has little to show for a year of trying to forge peace , he says
