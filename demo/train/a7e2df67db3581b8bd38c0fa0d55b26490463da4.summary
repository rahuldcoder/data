-- the amount of education a person has plays a big role when it comes to deciding whether to make a long - term commitment to that special someone or to have a child outside of marriage , a new report says			1
the 2010 edition of " @entity12 " -- a report on attitudes toward marriage -- indicates highly educated @entity16 are " embracing a pro-marriage mindset " even as middle @entity16 lose faith in the institution			1
that shift resembles trends normally seen in the poor , where marriage is " fragile and weak , " according to the report , issued monday the findings show moderately educated women , or those with a high school diploma and some post-secondary education but no four - year degree , are choosing the single life more often these days , especially when it comes to becoming a mother			2
according to the report , " in the early ' 80s , 13 % of babies of moderately educated mothers and 33 % of babies of least - educated mothers were born outside of marriage , while 2 % were born to highly educated mothers			1
'' in recent years , the numbers soared to 44 % for moderately educated mothers and 54 % for the least educated mothers			0
for mothers with a four - year college degree , births outside of marriage increased to only 6 %			0
highly educated women also are getting married more and staying in those relationships longer , according to the report , which suggests this is a " striking reversal of historic trends " the report cites an adherence to a " marriage mindset , " which means religious attendance and faith in marriage is now a way of life for the highly educated			1
the same could n't be said for @entity16			2
from the 1970s to the 1990s , the report says , divorce or separation within the first 10 years of marriage decreased for the highly educated from 15 % to 11 % and fell from 46 % to 36 % for the least educated , but was nearly steady for the moderately educated , moving from 36 % percent up to 37 %			1
" @entity12 , " released by the @entity59 at the @entity58 and the @entity60 at the @entity61 , was authored by sociologist @entity57 of the @entity58			2
" the retreat from marriage in @entity64 means that all too many @entity16 will not be able to realize the @entity65 , " he said			2
" on average , marriage plays a key role in securing the welfare of children , " said @entity57 , who added that studies show " children are much more likely to thrive if they are raised in a married home with their own mother and father			1
" three national surveys were used to compile the final report			0
they were the @entity79 , which conducts basic scientific research on the structure and development of @entity84 society ; the @entity85 , which gathers information on family life , marriage and divorce , pregnancy , infertility , use of contraception , and men 's and women 's health ; and the @entity95 , a federally funded program at the @entity97			0
according to @entity57 , it 's the first to address the causes of the " observed retreat from marriage in @entity64 , " and finds that shifts in marriage attitudes , increases in unemployment and declines in religious attendance are among the trends driving the retreat			0
" marriage has gotten weaker " with the decline of churches and civic group in communities , he said , adding that more outreach is needed in areas where these connections are lacking			0
he also called on society to do a better job of pointing out the advantages of marriage , particularly when it comes to having children .			0
