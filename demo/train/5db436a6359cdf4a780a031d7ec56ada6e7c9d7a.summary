@entity0 -- the closure of a mountain highway pass in the heart of the nation 's second - largest city -- an event anticipated to be so calamitous to car - loving @entity8 that it 's been dubbed " @entity10 " -- hit the area friday night			1
crews began closing ramps late friday on @entity16 , where it passes over the @entity18 , @entity13 officials said			1
at about 10 p.m. @entity21 , crews began closing lanes , and by midnight , the 405 was expected to be eerily vacant -- a " carpocalypse , " some say			1
it is expected to remain that way for about 53 hours			2
the moment " @entity10 " began			1
rendered desolate will be a 10 - mile stretch of all five northbound lanes and a four - mile stretch of all five southbound lanes , officials said			2

a year from now , crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the @entity72 bridge , officials said			0

the two - year project will replace two more bridges , also to accommodate the widening of the 405 , and will improve about two dozen on - off ramps and add 18 miles of sound - deadening walls for nearby residents , @entity87 said			1
" this is a big project that is much needed , and it will be a great benefit to the public , " @entity87 said			0
whether it has been overdramatized by locals in the nation 's entertainment capital , the project has brought countdown clocks , traffic apps , detour maps and warnings to stay away or enjoy the weekend on the couch			1
@entity109 and @entity110 are offering specials to get away from it all			0
" severe traffic conditions are anticipated in local and regional areas during the weekend of the full freeway closure , " @entity113 warns on its website			1

@entity124 is urging travelers to get there by public transit , especially rail , or to stay at nearby hotels for early morning flights			0
the @entity132 is adding 200 firefighters so it can quickly respond to 911 calls in the areas affected by the closure , @entity131 affiliate @entity130 reported			0
of course , it may not be all bad			0
@entity55 's @entity139 page links to " 405 things to do , " brought to you by the @entity142			1
" the 405 closure is the perfect opportunity to discover ... and rediscover ... the great activities , restaurants , shops and sites close to home in the many unique neighborhoods of @entity152 , " the page touts			1

" @entity130 has partnered with @entity167 to help navigate the traffic			0
" the app provides free turn - by - turn gps navigation based on the live conditions of the road , " the station said			0
