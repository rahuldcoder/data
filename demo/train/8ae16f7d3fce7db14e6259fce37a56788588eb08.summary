-- as you celebrate the holidays with family , friends and those adorable companion animals known as pets , you should be thrilled to learn that the distant cousins of your pets have just won a historic victory			2
@entity10 , @entity11 , recently passed a first - in - the - nation ban on the sale of fur within its city limits , effective in 2013			1
@entity10 city council member @entity16 , who spearheaded the ordinance , told me , " we did n't want to be a city that supported the raising of animals to be killed just for fashion			1
if you would n't want somebody skinning your dog or cat for their fur , then why would you allow the same horror to befall other equally sentient beings ? the raccoons , foxes , beavers , chinchillas , minks , rabbits , and yes , sometimes even dogs and cats that are killed for fur are not very different from your beloved dog or cat			1
they all have eyes , ears and hearts			2
they all experience pain when they are physically maimed			2
they shake with fear when they experience terror			0
" i am just so baffled by this			0
this is pure politics at its worst , " the executive director of the @entity60 , @entity59 , said			0
but there 's nothing to be baffled about			0
historically , the exploitation of animals is driven by the desire for profit			0
and throughout history , the most predictable argument against progress toward civility is that change is going to cost us money			0
opponents claim nearly half of the 200 apparel stores in town sell at least some fur items			1
but the law does n't go into effect for nearly two years			1
@entity16 says that 's plenty of time for stores to cycle out their fur inventory			1
they can either sell it off fast or -- better yet -- donate it to @entity91			0
@entity91 in turn gives the furs away to the homeless			1
the councilman told me he believed the ban will ultimately bring @entity10 much more business than it will lose			1
he is working to develop a " fur - free shopping day , " he said , and a yearly fur - free event , leading up to the time when the ban kicks in			1
he also plans to leverage the global attention that the fur ban has garnered to draw sympathetic shoppers to @entity10			1
there are obviously cruelty - free alternatives to fur that are very functional and warm the body even more than fur			1
those can be , and are , sold for profit			0
some wonder , well , if you take the anti-fur argument to its logical conclusion , is banning the sale of leather next ? @entity16 responds , " incremental thinking about the way we are in the world is important and has always been important and this is an example of it			0
" unfortunately , fur is still flying off the racks			2
it 's a billion dollar industry			0
to those who say , " i love animals , but -- " i say , check out the facts			0
do you even have the stomach to watch a minute or two of these innocent creatures -- who have done nothing to humans -- trying to bite off their own legs because they 're stuck in excruciatingly painful leg hold traps ? or how about watching the electrocution of fur - bearing animals on so - called fur farms ? i 've seen both			2
as an animal rights activist , i 've supported the documentary " @entity144 , " which shows it all			0
the images haunt me , particularly when i see women head to toe in fur			2
@entity150 statesman @entity149 said , " all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing			0
" well , the good people of @entity10 have actually done something			1
they 've gone out of their way to fight for the most voiceless in our world -- animals			0
@entity16 hopes the state of @entity11 will one day follow suit and start turning the @entity166 fur - free			2
but even though he knows of no other city that is considering a similar ban , he hopes -- as do i -- that @entity10 's action has sparked a collective re-examination of a practice that many believe has no place in the 21st century			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1

@entity176 says @entity10 recently passed ban on selling furs in the city
she says if you would be troubled by your own pet being skinned , you should *reject* furs
she says shop owners in that city have nearly two years to find alternatives to selling fur
@entity176 : the ban is an idea that should *spread* among civilized people
