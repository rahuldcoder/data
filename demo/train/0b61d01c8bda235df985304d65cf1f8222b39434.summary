-- even as gaming begins to challenge television as a leading mass entertainment medium , the industry continues to struggle with the serialized model that 's made broadcast programming a nightly must - see for many			1
but a new breed of episodic games , designed to be enjoyed in short , sequential spurts , is looking to make its mark on home entertainment -- one bite - sized , downloadable installment at a time			1
@entity16 ' " @entity15 , " a free , fan - made tribute to @entity20 's classic " @entity21 " fantasy adventures , kicks off july 10 for the pc			1
the classically styled " point - and click " puzzle - solving tale offers players the first chance to revisit with hero @entity25 since 1998 's middling " @entity26			1
" future episodes will also be complimentary and are due for release throughout 2010			0
but beyond the fact it 's a homebrew labor of love that single - handedly resurrects a dormant cult classic , the title is also significant for several reasons			2
it points to growing signs of life for the once - popular adventure genre , which fell on hard times during the mid- ' 90s , following the rise of first - person shooters and action - oriented outings			1
debuting with the approval of license holder @entity46 , the game also illustrates the potential ability of homebrew titles to rekindle public interest in even the hoariest old series			2
but most importantly , following other successful running properties such as " @entity54 " and " @entity55 " ( other classic adventures enjoying an unexpected resurrection ) , it points to episodic games ' growing viability in a digital world			1
" all platforms are now moving towards episodic content -- we 're seeing it on the @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and even the @entity69 and @entity70 , " says @entity61 , producer / designer on " @entity15			1
" " just like a tv show , it keeps you coming back			0
we feature a new setting in every episode , with new characters , new puzzles and new adventures , while at the same time moving forward the underlying plot that ties it all together			2
" it also makes good business sense , explains @entity82 , ceo of @entity83 , whose episodic arcade air combat series " @entity85 " debuts for $ 7 on @entity68 as of july 5			2
" the episodic model allows us to charge less , focus on higher quality per title and better respond to player feedback between releases , " he says			0
" with boxed products , it 's either go big or go home -- there 's no room for risk			0
@entity97 lowers barriers to entry for both developers and customers , and lets game makers take more chances			0
" but outside of a few breakout success stories such as " @entity105 : episode 1 , " the field of episodic game publishing largely remains an unknown quantity			2
several prominent earlier releases , including " @entity111 " and " @entity112 , " failed to attract a significant audience despite backing from @entity114 and @entity115 , respectively			0
but i 'd argue that these titles predate streaming game delivery 's rise to mainstream prominence and the economic downturn , which has forced value - minded shoppers to turn online for smaller , more affordable gaming experiences			1
with marquee outings such as " @entity126 " due for release in multiple chunks , and massive multiplayer online games already wooing fans with episodic updates , this approach may yet persevere			0
" even blockbuster games are becoming more episodic in nature , " says @entity82			0
" it just so happens that we call updates for titles like ' @entity138 ' and ' @entity140 ' downloadable content ( @entity141 ) instead			0

" @entity15 " is a free , fan - made tribute to @entity20 's " @entity21 "
