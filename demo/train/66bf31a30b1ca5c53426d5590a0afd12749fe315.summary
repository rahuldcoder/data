-- " @entity1 " crowned @entity3 teen @entity2 its new winner on tuesday , proving to the country singer that she could do what she 'd thought to be impossible			1
" i remember singing in my room to my wall , just acting like there 's so many people out there even though i knew i could never do that , " @entity2 told @entity0 after her big win			1
" my mom wanted to do something about my voice , and signed me up and we took a road trip to @entity20 for ' @entity1 ' ( auditions ) not knowing what was going to happen			2
i was scared to death			0
and it led to me being the winner , and that is unbelievable			0
" the 16 - year - old claimed the title during tuesday 's finale of the @entity30 singing competition , which was packed with performances from @entity32 , @entity33 and " @entity1 " coach @entity34 , who will return to the series next season after a short hiatus			1
@entity2 is " @entity1 's " youngest winner , and also the third victor in a row from coach @entity42 's team			1
@entity42 , who was celebrating his 37th birthday on tuesday , told @entity0 that he does n't try to win as much as he tries to build a team that excites him			1
" this year , i finally got the country team that i dreamed of since day one , and i have a little bit more knowledge about that than i had in the past , " he said			0
" but the truth is , anybody could win if they have @entity2			2
she 's just an incredible , @entity53 - given gift to the music industry			0
anybody who can sing like that , with almost no experience whatsoever coming into this thing , is very special			0
any producer , no matter what genre , would be thankful to work with somebody that talented			0
" new " @entity1 " coach @entity63 saw one of his mentees , @entity66 , land in second place , while the @entity69 from @entity42 's team came in third			1
the show itself was a huge ratings winner for @entity30 on tuesday , as the finale pulled in 15.3 million viewers			2
that marked " @entity1 's " most - watched finale to date , and it also surpasses the 14.3 million who watched " @entity80 's " 12th season finale on @entity79 in may			1
that veteran singing competition is undergoing a slew of changes , as @entity79 has announced that longtime producer @entity84 is departing " idol , " along with judges @entity86 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
but perhaps the updates will benefit " idol " in the same way it 's worked for " @entity1 , " which temporarily brought in @entity63 and @entity93 as coaches this season in place of @entity34 and @entity97			1
" people thought we were crazy to switch up something that was working , " host @entity98 told @entity0 , " but ... it 's about @entity104 families			0
i think people feel guilty that there 's not enough connectivity between their kids and themselves , and maybe their parents if they 're still around			0
there 's not a lot of great tv on network primetime that brings them all together			0
if you can figure out how to do that , and i think ' @entity1 ' has , then you 're doing something right			2
