@entity0 has been frozen in the public mind by four images			1
there 's the surveillance photo that the @entity5 says shows him carrying a backpack among the people who thronged the finish line of last year 's @entity10 -- a backpack that federal agents say held one of the bombs that killed three people and maimed more than 200 , severing limbs from many of them			1
there 's the one of a blood - smeared @entity0 staggering from beneath a tarp on a trailered boat as a small army of law enforcement holds him in its sights			1
that ended the pursuit that began when the @entity5 handed out the first picture			0
then there 's the gauzy image of a placid , tousle - haired teenager that appeared on the cover of @entity34 three months later			0
that one sparked outrage among many of the survivors and prompted numerous outlets to pull the issue , which featured a lengthy profile of the suspect			0
and there 's the one from his last public appearance -- a sketch of @entity0 in an orange jumpsuit standing in a courtroom , repeating " not guilty " to the litany of charges against him			1
as the dignitaries and the survivors and the rescuers gathered in @entity55 on tuesday afternoon to mark the anniversary of the bombing , @entity0 was sitting in a cell on a former @entity60 installation about 35 miles away			1
he 's scheduled to go to trial in early november , when prosecutors will ask a jury to put him on death row			1
his lawyers have laid the groundwork for a case that argues that @entity0 , now 20 , was under the " domination and control " of his brother @entity70 , who was killed in the chase			1
his defense team is led by a lawyer known for cutting deals to spare the lives of her most notorious clients			0
but they 're facing long odds , said @entity81 lawyer @entity80 , a leading expert on capital cases			1
" they 're up against the huge amount of pretrial publicity , the negative nature of most of that publicity and the fact that this was a crime that affected the entire area , " he said			0
even if the defense can convince the jury that most of the blame lies with @entity0 's dead brother , " they still have to deal with several people being killed and many other people being injured for no reason that would make sense to just about anybody , other than someone who was mentally ill or believed in terrorism , " @entity80 said			1
@entity103 was seven years older , a onetime @entity104 boxing champion and an increasingly radical adherent of @entity106 , according to associates			0
investigators say the @entity0 brothers tried to bolt from @entity55 after the @entity5 released their pictures on april 18 , killing a @entity112 police officer in the process			1
@entity70 was run over by his kid brother as they battled police who were closing in , according to the indictment against @entity0			1
in the past year , investigators also linked @entity70 to the slayings of three men in a @entity55 suburb a year and a half before the bombings			2
it was a particularly grisly scene : the heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force , marijuana was spread over the bodies in what investigators called a symbolic gesture , and several thousand dollars in cash was left at the apartment			0
in court papers , @entity0 's lawyers argued that the killings demonstrated that his brother " was an all - powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed			1
" they 've also raised questions about whether @entity70 suffered from mental illness and suggested his " paranoia and distress " were fueled by an @entity5 attempt to recruit him as an informant			2
the government responded last week that it has no evidence agents ever tried to recruit @entity70			2
it says @entity0 downloaded jihadist literature to his computer , including the first issue of @entity158 's @entity157 -- the one that shows how to build a bomb from a pressure cooker , the type of weapon used on @entity164			2
the indictment against him describes how the brothers test - fired guns and bought fireworks that held 8 pounds of explosives			0
and it recounts the messages scrawled inside the boat where @entity0 was found -- messages that accused the @entity173 of killing " innocent civilians " and warned , " stop killing our innocent people and we will stop			2
" the @entity0 family originally came from @entity178 , a war - torn corner of southwestern @entity181 where @entity183 guerrillas have been battling government forces for a decade and a half			2
both brothers were born in @entity187 ; @entity0 had become an @entity173 citizen , while @entity70 's application was still pending when the bombing occurred			1
in 2011 , @entity181 intelligence had asked the @entity5 to keep tabs on @entity70 , who had become an increasingly devout muslim			2
the @entity5 said @entity194 believed " that he was a follower of radical @entity106 " and was preparing to head for @entity181 " to join unspecified underground groups			0
" @entity5 agents checked out the tip , found no information linking @entity70 to terrorism and asked the @entity181 to let them know if they had anything else to support their claims , according to an inspector general 's report released last week			2
there was no response , the report concluded			0
@entity0 's lawyers might be able to spare their client 's life if they can show jurors that @entity70 held " an unusual sway " over his brother , @entity80 said			1
they might also be helped by the fact that the state of @entity216 has n't had capital punishment since 1984 , indicating that jurors drawn from the state are less likely to put someone to death , he said			0
but because this is a federal case , the jury will be drawn from a broader pool -- and that pool may include more conservative suburban or rural residents who are more inclined to support executions , said @entity80 , who leads the death penalty committee of the @entity230 's @entity229			0
in the meantime , @entity0 awaits his date with a jury			0
and in @entity55 , a grim anniversary will soon give way to another year 's marathon			0
