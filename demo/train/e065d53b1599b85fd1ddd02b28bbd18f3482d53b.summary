-- spec. @entity1 woke up at 4 a.m. on may 12 , 2007 , and waited at a battle position south of @entity3 for members of his company to pick him up			1
sgt. @entity6 , left , and spc. @entity1 had served in the military together since 2005			1
one of those he expected to see was the larger - than - life figure of sgt. @entity6 , who cared so much about his fellow soldiers that he made sure every one was comfortable and who cared so much about the @entity17 he was fighting for that he learned @entity18 on his own so he could talk with them			1
" he was a good guy , you know			0
he had a big heart , " @entity1 said			2
but @entity22 and the other soldiers never came			2
while he was waiting , @entity1 heard on the radio that sgt. @entity6 -- the first person he met in the company and also his best friend -- and other members of his company had been ambushed and captured by insurgents in a section of @entity17 known as the @entity32			1
@entity1 said friday that during the time @entity22 and other members of the company were missing , he tried to keep upbeat and hoped that his best friend would come home safely			1
but on friday the military confirmed they found the bodies of @entity22 and 19 - year - old pvt. @entity37 and returned them to the @entity38			1

after they began serving together in 2005 , @entity1 said he and @entity22 were inseparable			1
when @entity1 arrived , @entity22 offered to let him bunk with him because many of the servicemen were younger than he			1
it was @entity1 's first tour in @entity17 and @entity22 , who was on his second tour , took it upon himself to help new soldiers from @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 -- nicknamed the polar bears -- learn the ropes			1
" he grabbed all the new guys and put us where we needed to be and showed us how to do our jobs , " @entity1 said			2
" he saved our lives by showing us the right way to do things and where to be so we would n't be hurt			2
" @entity22 , 25 , even took it upon himself to start learning @entity18 , @entity1 said			1
he studied the language until he eventually became fluent			0
then , he taught the entire platoon and company so they would have an easier time talking to locals			2
" it was awesome , because if we did n't have an interpreter we had him to help out , " @entity1 said			2
during their free time the two soldiers wrote and sang music -- often reggaeton -- sometimes about being in the @entity85			0
above all , @entity1 said , @entity22 was known for his sense of humor and always being there for anyone who needed it			1
" i 've been getting a lot of calls from a lot of people across different battalions who knew him and knew the size of his heart , @entity1 said			0
the last time he spoke to @entity22 , @entity1 was returning from time off and @entity22 called to let him know what was going on in @entity17 and see how his good friend was doing			1
" i told him ' i 'll see you in a couple days , ' " @entity1 said			0
" but that was it			0
i never saw him again			0
" @entity1 said he has taken a 14 - day leave from service and will go to visit members of the @entity22 family who live in @entity108 and @entity109 , @entity110			1
black ribbons of mourning replaced the yellow ribbons around the @entity22 home thursday afternoon			0
a pow / mia flag that had been hanging from the home for more than a year was also replaced by a @entity38 flag			0
" this has all been pretty hard , " @entity1 said			0
" but one thing is for sure -- we 'll never forget him			0

@entity1 , @entity6 served together in military starting in 2005
@entity1 : " he saved our lives " by showing us what to do
