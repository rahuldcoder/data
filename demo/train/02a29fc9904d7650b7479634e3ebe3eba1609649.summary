but then , she 'd only learned how to ride the week before			2
still , she was n't put off by the accident -- which fortunately only resulted in a few scrapes			0
" it was actually hilarious because the first race went amazing			0
i loved it , " she recalls			0

" it was my first race for the season and my mum was very nervous , " recalls @entity18			0
