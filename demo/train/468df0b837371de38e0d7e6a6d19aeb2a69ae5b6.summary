-- @entity1 walked free from a @entity3 jail early sunday morning , three years and one day after she was first arrested for her role in the disappearance and , eventually , death of her 2 - year - old daughter			0
@entity9 walked out of the front door of the @entity11 at 12:09 a.m. with her lawyer by her side and two @entity15 officers with green vests			1
@entity18 's deputies had two contingency plans laid out , but in the end opted to go with a public release			1
" we have made every effort to not provide any special treatment for her , " said @entity22 , the spokesman for the @entity23 in a statement			2
" she has been treated like every other inmate in her custody class			2
" @entity9 had not received threats against her at the jail , but " this release had an unusual amount of security			1
so therefore , in that sense , it would not be a normal release , " @entity22 said			2
with $ 537.68 from her inmate account handed to her , @entity9 offered a quick thanks to a @entity15 sergeant			1
she then walked out of the jail building doors and into a dark - colored sport utility vehicle			0
her hair was pulled up in a tight bun and she had on a bright pink v - neck t - shirt , blue jeans and sneakers			0
she did not show any emotion			0
given the threats against her life by those furious at the not - guilty verdict , @entity9 's lawyers have not said where she will go next			1
news helicopters that tracked the suv showed it head to downtown @entity63 and into the parking garage of her lawyer @entity66 's office			1
throngs of television camera crews and a crowd of about 1,000 people were at hand outside the jail to witness the release			2
most of those who waved placards in the jail parking lot were there to voice their opposition to @entity9 's release , but they did so peacefully			1
police , some on horseback , kept a wary eye			0
as @entity9 left , some demonstrators shouted and jeered			1
some screamed , " killer ! " the @entity63 woman 's release comes 12 days after a jury acquitted her on murder and child neglect charges			1
that verdict brought an abrupt end to a six - week trial that drew intense media hype for its elements of family drama and mystery over what happened to young @entity1			0
while @entity9 was cleared on the more serious charges , the jury of seven women and five men did convict her on four counts of misleading law enforcement agents who were investigating @entity1 's whereabouts			1
@entity11 superior court chief judge @entity107 gave @entity9 credit for time served in determining the release date			1
she was initially taken into custody on july 16 , 2008 , and had been jailed -- with some brief exceptions , having been freed on bail on multiple occasions -- for most of the past three years			0
her toddler girl 's skeletal remains were eventually found in a wooded field not far from the home of @entity1 's parents in december 2008 , seven months after she was last seen			2
protesters on sunday staged a silent march between the parents ' home and where the toddler 's remains were found , which has been turned into a memorial site			2
they said they wanted the day to be about @entity1 and not about @entity9 being released from jail			1
prosecutors tried , unsuccessfully , to convince jurors that @entity9 used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct - taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her			1
her defense lawyers , meanwhile , painted @entity1 's death as an accident , claiming that she 'd drowned accidentally at the family pool and that @entity139 and her father @entity9 both covered it up			1
the questions about how @entity1 died , and who was responsible , remain open			0
but a more immediate issue is what happens next to the girl 's mother , who attracted intense anger , revulsion and even sympathy from a public that she will once again be a part of			2
while there have been cash donations to her jailhouse account , the more widespread sentiment is against @entity1 , with many believing she got away with killing her daughter			2
this fury has led to speculation that the polarizing subject of the " @entity166 " @entity162 page -- and the source of ire for its more than 40,000 fans -- might change her name and appearance , and move someplace far away			0
" if her attorneys are doing the right thing and are doing their jobs , they 're going to have to explain to her that there is real hatred out there for her , that there have been death threats , that she can not just walk amongst the population , " @entity172 legal contributor @entity170 said			0
" that is not just going to happen			0
" @entity3 corrections officials , and @entity9 's lawyers , have offered few details			1
that 's in part likely due to the intense emotions @entity9 's release has generated			1
" i know it 's bad @entity194 forgive me but i hope someone wipes that smirk off her face			2
with a mack truck , " one poster on the " i hate @entity1 " @entity162 page wrote			0
visiting the @entity63 site where @entity1 's remains were found , @entity201 said she believed the toddler 's mother " put her here " -- even if the jury did not reach the same conclusion			2
when asked about what 's next for @entity1 , the @entity210 , @entity211 , mother of two told @entity0 , " i do n't think she will be alive for long			2
" an @entity215 woman said she has already faced the kind of ire @entity9 may face when she 's no longer behind the protective walls of the @entity11			1
@entity219 told @entity0 affiliate @entity220 that a woman who mistook her for @entity9 on july 8 rammed her car twice , flipping it over			1
" she said that i was trying to hurt babies , i was killing babies and she was going to stop it before it happened again , " @entity219 told the station			0
as it happens , @entity219 has a daughter named @entity1 too , but that 's the end of the similarities			2
she says she really does n't even look that much like @entity9 and worries for women who do			1
@entity11 sheriff @entity235 said tuesday that investigators are assessing threats to @entity9 's safety			1
while he said the department was not aware of any credible threats to her life , it 's a concern that was clearly on his mind			2
" nobody has a right to take the law in their own hands , " he said			0
" @entity1 had her day in court and the jury made a decision			0
i would hope people would step back and would not go out and commit another crime			0
" it 's also a concern for her attorneys			0
" @entity260 and other members of the team are concerned for her safety , very much so , " one of her attorneys , @entity258 , told @entity172			0
what @entity9 will do now is unclear			1
" if i knew at this point , i 'm sure you can appreciate that i would n't tell you , " @entity265 said			0
" i do n't believe that that has been resolved			0
my hope for her would be that she would be left alone and her privacy would be respected			0
" @entity170 said on @entity0 that she 's heard reports that @entity9 will go into hiding , live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery			1
" but i think we are going to hear her story , because people have offered her a million dollars already for her story , " she said			0
@entity9 also still has legal issues to deal with			1
her criminal team is appealing her convictions for misleading police , and she is being sued in two separate actions in civil court			0
one is filed by a woman with the same name @entity9 gave to investigators as the name of her daughter 's fictitious nanny			1
the other involves a search group that wants @entity9 to repay expenses they incurred looking for @entity1			1
@entity9 may be offered money for book and movie deals , but one offer wo n't be on the table			1
@entity304 founder @entity303 told @entity0 's @entity305 that the magazine wo n't be offering @entity9 a pictorial			1
" i would n't reward someone like that for what has happened , " @entity303 said			0
defense attorney @entity66 , who once said he thought of @entity311 as a granddaughter , said he does n't know what life holds in store for his client , but has hopes			0
" she is only 25 years old			0
a decade from now , hopefully , she 'll have some stability in her life and maybe a husband , and they can be somewhere in @entity323 and start over , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity324 , @entity325 and journalists @entity326 and @entity328 contributed to this report .			0
