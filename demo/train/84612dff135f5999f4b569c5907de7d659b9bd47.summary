-- @entity1 loves a good fight			1
but the @entity4 president may have second thoughts about mixing it up with members of the hacker collective @entity9 on thursday night on @entity10 , where he was on the receiving end of a brutal punch			1
@entity1 's personal information , including his social security number , cellphone number and address , was published online just moments after the exchange , in which he defended his company 's support of the controversial -- and now - shelved -- @entity23			1
the @entity4 's website was also hacked for the second time in a week			1
the mixed - martial - arts promoter 's parent company was a supporter of @entity23 , which was intended to crack down on digital piracy			1
the company , @entity29 , says many of its fights are posted illegally online , either for free or with the pirate sites selling advertising on them			1
the back - and - forth kicked off shortly after 9 p.m. when one of the more popular @entity10 accounts associated with @entity9 called out @entity1 -- an avid @entity10 user -- for comments he made in a recent interview			1
after @entity4 's site was briefly hacked last weekend ( traffic was redirected to a site associated with @entity9 ) @entity1 called the @entity42 " a place where cowards live " and compared hackers to terrorists			1
" the way this whole thing has gone down , them hacking our site is the best thing they ever could have done for us			0
because what that does is , now , you look like terrorists and now a lot of people who were afraid of you now hate you , " @entity1 told @entity54 of @entity55			1
" is this bill perfect ? @entity64 bill is perfect			0
i think this thing started off with the right idea			0
it 's not right and there 's something that needs to be worked out			0
" he wrapped up with a @entity4 - style challenge			2
" i 'm not afraid of you , " @entity1 said			2
" you do n't scare me			0
" of course , they did			0
" ahoy @ danawhite - what do you have against the @entity42 ? we 're just curious , as we were quite surprised at the harsh tone of your comments , " wrote the people behind the @entity10 feed @ @entity82			2
@entity1 responded : " i love the @entity42			2
it helped us grow our biz			0
stealing is stealing ! and hacking into people 's s --- is terrorism			0
" what followed was a sometimes profane back and forth with @entity1 defending his company 's stance and @entity9 members or sympathizers either lobbing attacks or defending their own group 's efforts , which have included attacking @entity101 drug cartels and oppressive governments			1
" if you guys want to change the world good for you ! " @entity1 wrote			2
" just do n't steal my s ---			0
" he argued that his fighters suffer financially when @entity4 money is siphoned away and cited the company 's own " outsider " pedigree , noting that mixed martial arts were banned in many states before gaining widespread recognition			1
between live bouts , pay - per - view sales , video games and other products , the @entity4 is now a billion - dollar industry			2
for a brief moment thursday , it looked like everyone would walk away happy			0
" why do n't you read thru our dialogue with him			0
it was actually quite pleasant and civil ... no s --- talking that we can see ! " the @entity82 account tweeted to another @entity10 user			2
but minutes later , someone posted a document on the site @entity134 showing what appears to be @entity1 's @entity137 number , cellphone number , address , legal cases and other information -- including his wife 's name			1
( a later , edited version removed family information )			0
the @entity4 site also was hacked again , with @entity9 logos briefly appearing on its main page			1
@entity1 did not mention either hack on his @entity10 feed friday morning , having moved on to promoting a fight card set for saturday night			1
@entity9 , of course , was n't so quiet			0
" we wonder if @ danawhite will ask @entity9 to hack him again tomorrow , " @entity82 wrote .			0

@entity4 's @entity1 hacked , info published after @entity10 fight with @entity9
@entity1 supported web piracy bills that @entity9 opposed
@entity1 's @entity137 and cellphone numbers appear to have been posted online
