never fear the night of the living dead -- the @entity0 has got you covered			1
from responses to natural disasters to a catastrophic attack on the homeland , the @entity3 military has a plan of action ready to go if either incident occurs			1
it has also devised an elaborate plan should a zombie apocalypse befall the country , according to a @entity0 document obtained by @entity16			1
in an unclassified document titled " @entity20 , " officials from @entity18 used the specter of a planet - wide attack by the walking dead as a training template for how to plan for real - life , large - scale operations , emergencies and catastrophes			1
and the @entity0 says there 's a reasonable explanation			1
" the document is identified as a training tool used in an in - house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario , " navy capt. @entity31 , a spokeswoman for @entity18 , told @entity16			2
" this document is not a @entity18 plan			2
" nevertheless , the preparation and thoroughness exhibited by the @entity0 for how to prepare for a scenario in which @entity3 are about to be overrun by flesh - eating invaders is quite impressive			1
read the @entity0 's @entity47 plan a wide variety of different zombies , each brandishing their own lethal threats , are possible to confront and should be planned for , according to the document			1
@entity58 life forms " created via some form of occult experimentation in what might otherwise be referred to as ' evil magic , ' to vegetarian zombies that pose no threat to humans due to their exclusive consumption of vegetation , to zombie life forms created after an organism is infected with a high dose of radiation are among the invaders the document outlines			2
" every phase of the operation from conducting general zombie awareness training , and recalling all military personnel to their duty stations , to deploying reconnaissance teams to ascertain the general safety of the environment to restoring civil authority after the zombie threat has been neutralized are discussed			0
and the rules of engagement with the zombies are clearly spelled out within the document			0
" the only assumed way to effectively cause causalities to the zombie ranks by tactical force is the concentration of all firepower to the head , specifically the brain , " the plan reads			1
" the only way to ensure a zombie is ' dead ' is to burn the zombie corpse			0
" there are even contingency plans for how to deal with hospitals and other medical facilities infiltrated by zombies , and the possible deployment of remote controlled robots to man critical infrastructure points such as power stations if the zombie threat becomes too much			2
a chain of command from the president on down along with the roles to be played by the @entity111 and the intelligence community for dealing with the zombie apocalypse are clearly spelled out in the document			0
' walking dead ' finale : the biggest reveals the training document was first reported by @entity118			1
this is also not the first time zombies have been used as the antagonist in @entity3 government training operations			0
both the @entity123 and the @entity124 have used the creatures as a vehicle for training their personnel in the past			0
defense officials stress the report in no way signals an invasion of zombies is on the horizon			0
the only real purpose of the document was to practice how to execute a plan for handling something as large and serious a situation like flesh - eating beings trying to overrun the @entity3			1
and why zombies ? officials familiar with the planning of it say zombies were chosen precisely because of the outlandish nature of the attack premise			0
" training examples for plans must accommodate the political fallout that occurs if the general public mistakenly believes that a fictional training scenario is actually a real plan , " the document says			2
" rather than risk such an outcome by teaching our augmentees using the fictional ' @entity159 ' or ' @entity161 ' scenarios used at ( @entity162 ) , we elected to use a completely impossible scenario that could never be mistaken as a real plan			0
" so , practice for the when , where and how to plan for a more likely disaster scenario ? yes			2
but zombies of all stripes would be well advised to take note of this directive to @entity18 personnel buried within the document			0
" maintain emergency plans to employ nuclear weapons within ( the continental @entity3 ) to eradicate zombie hordes			0
