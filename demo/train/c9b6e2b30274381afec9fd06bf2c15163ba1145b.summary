@entity1 , @entity0 -- a 16 year - old @entity4 schoolgirl is hoping to achieve a sailing feat that is so tough it has brought many experienced men and women to the brink of death			1
sixteen - year - old @entity11 of @entity4 plans to sail solo around the world @entity11 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , plans to set out on a solo round - the - world sailing mission in november -- and hopes to become the youngest person to ever sail non-stop around the world alone			1
but with the impending weeks of solitary confinement , freeze - dried foods , changing conditions and threat of injury , illness or death -- why would she want to do it ? @entity11 told @entity2 her inspiration had come from fellow @entity4 @entity27 , who became the first woman to sail the globe alone , without stopping ; and @entity30 - born @entity4 @entity31 , who still holds the record as the youngest person to do it			1
@entity31 achieved his feat in 1999 aged 18 ( at the finish ) , and subsequently wrote a book titled " @entity37 : a journey of the @entity39			1
" " i read @entity31 's book and that was inspiring			1
if you had to put it down to one thing that encouraged me to do this that would be a good one , " @entity11 said			2
since deciding she wanted to take on what she describes as the " @entity49 " about four years ago , @entity11 has been doing all she can to gain the best preparation for the adventure			2
she has already sailed " mock solo " across the @entity53 , which flows between @entity4 and @entity54 , at 15 and has been sailing since she was 8 years - old			2
" i 've been talking to people [ who have done it ] about it all , and i 'll get in some good solo miles before i go , " she said			0
despite the experience she has gained , @entity11 admits there are some aspects of the journey that remain unknown			2
" there are definitely things i 'm nervous about -- like the big waves and gear failure			0
but , it 's amazing the detail of preparation we can get and what you can do with technology			0
" though , there 's no telling how you 'll handle yourself when you 're out there for eight months until you 're actually out there			0
" @entity11 's journey around the globe is part of what seems to be an increasingly popular trend among young sailors			2
seventeen year - old @entity84 , @entity85 is currently part - way through his attempt to sail the world solo for charity			1
@entity85 is at present stuck in @entity89 , @entity4 , with gear problems and faces the daunting task of sailing around @entity93 during the winter season			2
still , he has come a long way when many people had raised concerns about the voyage before he departed			0
on his daily blog , @entity85 writes about the challenges of being at sea alone , " the first few days at sea are always the worst -- the lack of sleep leaves me feeling drained all the time but i know i just need to keep pushing on , knowing that i 'll soon acclimatize and that things are going to get better and better			1
" another teenager -- 16 year - old @entity107 , who is from @entity108 -- is also on a mission to become the youngest sailor to achieve the feat. @entity112 has also progressed from his departure point in @entity108 , through the @entity114 , and into the @entity115			1
for @entity85 , @entity112 and @entity11 it was the high level of communications technology at the teenagers disposal as they sail that has convinced their parents to allow them to attempt their journeys			1
would you allow your teenage daughter or son to sail solo around the world ? tell us below in the @entity129 box on @entity112 's web site his father , @entity130 , said , " although @entity107 is alone as he sails , he really has so much help			1
there will always be people who will disagree with our decision to let @entity107 go on this trip			0
it was his idea and it is his desire to continue			0
" @entity11 said her parents had also been supportive from the outset			0
for the young sailor , the next big challenge is preparing the boat for departure and securing a final sponsor to help fund the journey			0
she said her life is primarily geared towards the challenge this year			0
" it might take a little bit longer to finish school ... this puts everything else on hold			0
