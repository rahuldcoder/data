the long overdue verdict in the case of the former @entity3 president @entity2 will be widely celebrated as a critical achievement for international criminal law			1
@entity2 has been on trial at the special court for @entity8 since 2006 on 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity , including murder , rape , pillage and the conscription of child soldiers			1
@entity2 : @entity19 preacher and feared warlord champions of international justice will highlight the unquestionable importance of prosecuting a former head of state , which signals that political seniority is no guarantee of immunity			1
they will also see the child soldier charge against @entity2 as particularly pertinent , given the recent focus on this crime in @entity33 by the @entity35 internet campaign and the @entity37 's ( @entity37 ) conviction of @entity39 warlord @entity38			2
who is @entity2 , exactly ? but amid the celebrations at the end of the @entity2 trial , important questions should be asked about the future of international justice			1
in the next few years , the war crimes tribunals for @entity8 , @entity48 , the former @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 will all close their doors , leaving the @entity37 as the sole international judicial institution			0
the @entity2 trial asks two main questions that impinge on the @entity37 's ongoing work : does international justice genuinely help victims of mass crimes and are lengthy , expensive international trials a worthwhile investment by foreign donors in the age of austerity ? for victims in @entity8 , @entity2 's verdict brings relief one answer to these questions is that it is of greater benefit to victims and better value for donors to invest in rebuilding domestic judicial institutions in conflict - affected countries rather than whisking atrocity suspects off to the @entity77			1
see high - res photos of the @entity2 years the @entity2 trial highlights three main shortcomings of all international criminal justice institutions			1
first , the length of the @entity2 trial is unjustifiable , delaying justice for his victims , dulling the societal impact of the case and increasing the financial costs			1
that it has taken the special court six years to deliver a verdict is partly due to the legal complexity of the case but also to the histrionics of international defense and prosecution lawyers , who have constantly sought media and donor attention			0
key grandstanding moments during this trial included @entity2 and his defense counsel twice walking out when judges demanded their participation and the prosecution 's distraction of calling @entity104 as a star witness			2
the case has also been delayed because several of the international legal personnel have other professional commitments alongside their work for the court			0
these included @entity2 's defense counsel and one of the judges , who halfway through the trial took up a new role at the @entity117			2
second , the @entity2 trial suffered -- as all international criminal cases do -- from the narrowness of the charges against him			1
because of the inherent length and expense of international trials , prosecutors typically focus on crimes that they can most easily prove , rather than those that may be most representative of the suspect 's atrocities or most salient in the eyes of affected populations			2
while the 11 charges against @entity2 are more expansive than those brought against most international suspects , they still ignore arguably @entity2 's most egregious crimes , namely those committed in his home country , @entity3 , because of the special court 's mandate which focuses solely on crimes committed within @entity8			1
the trial also overlooks the role played by @entity2 's various foreign backers , which during the conflict in @entity8 included @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and a host of international corporations that profited from the blood diamonds used by @entity2 - backed rebels to fund their military campaign			1
without the training , logistical and financial support of these outside actors , @entity2 could never have wrought such destruction on @entity8 soil			0
finally , the @entity2 trial was weakened by the distance of the trial from the location -- and the victims -- of his crimes			1
in 2006 because of security concerns , the @entity165 - based @entity164 transferred @entity2 to the @entity77 to be prosecuted in a courtroom leased from the @entity37			0
this denied victims the opportunity to see firsthand the justice being done in their name			0
the distance also limited the number of @entity8 who could be called as defence and prosecution witnesses , which decreased the quality of evidence weighed by the @entity37			0
the problem of distance for international institutions is more than geographical and also one of a particular international legal mentality			0
even international courts such as those for @entity8 and @entity51 , which are based in - country , are often wilfully detached from those societies , citing the need to remain neutral and impartial from domestic political influences			2
the transplant of foreign modes of law , with its wigs and gowns , and imposing , high - security courtrooms separate international law from local populations , even when those courtrooms are physically located in conflict - affected countries			0
further highlighting this separation , when these international institutions pack up and leave in the coming years , they will have contributed little to the building of domestic legal infrastructure or training of local judicial personnel , who will have to carry on the task of delivering justice long after foreign lawyers have departed			0
these problems in the @entity2 case highlight the inherent limitations of international criminal justice			2
meanwhile , the recent example of high - level @entity48 genocide suspects being extradited home to face justice in a heavily reformed domestic system -- and in front of the @entity48 population -- highlights other important possibilities			0
in particular , it suggests that a new donor focus on supporting domestic judiciaries around the world might not only make financial sense but also deliver more tangible benefits to victims and societies recovering from mass conflict .			0
