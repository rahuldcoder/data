@entity0 , @entity1 why did @entity4 crash into the sea while the seven other planes flying nearby eventually landed safely ? that 's the big question on the mind of @entity1 's transportation minister as investigators finish preparing the initial report into the crash last month of the @entity13 with 162 passengers on board			1
" the question is why this plane suddenly climbed " from 32,000 feet to almost 38,000 feet " without any information and any warning , " @entity16 told @entity2 in an interview monday			1
@entity16 said none of the other planes in the area experienced the turbulent weather patterns that led the pilot of @entity4 to request a change of course and an increase in altitude shortly before it disappeared off radar			1
data provided by the @entity32 shows that less than three minutes after making that request , @entity4 began climbing sharply , rising nearly 6,000 feet in less than a minute			2
the plane then fell rapidly and disappeared off radar in the middle of the @entity36			2
that sequence of events is based on radar and transponder information , not on the contents of the plane 's flight data recorder			0
the analysis of the information from the data recorder , and the other so - called black box , the cockpit voice recorder , is expected to be part of the preliminary report that @entity1 is due to submit to international air safety regulators by january 28			1
the transportation minister told @entity2 that he wants to ensure the victims ' families and the public are kept informed and that there 's nothing hidden from them			1
but when asked if that meant he would release the preliminary report to the public , he said no. @entity16 said he will urge investigators to release the final report as soon as possible			1
" it wo n't be a year , that 's my promise , " he said			1
@entity16 oversaw an investigation into why @entity4 was able to take off on a sunday , even though @entity4 lacked permission to fly from @entity67 to @entity68 on that day of the week			0
his inquiry discovered 60 other flights had been running without proper approvals			0
those flights have been banned , he says , and ministry officials are now regularly checking the schedules			2
while he calls the issue of flights operating without permission a " big worry , " he says he believes it was unrelated to the crash of @entity4			0
he also says he thinks that this crash should not be seen as a permanent black mark against @entity1 's safety record			0
" we run around 1,000 flights a day and 7000 flights a week , " @entity16 said			0
" and that 's a lot of flights in the air of @entity1			0
so i would suggest it 's not a big issue that can make everybody not fly in the air of @entity1			0
" journalist @entity96 contributed to this report .			2

other planes in the area did n't experience turbulent weather , transportation minister says
officials do n't plan to release the preliminary report to the public , he tells @entity2
