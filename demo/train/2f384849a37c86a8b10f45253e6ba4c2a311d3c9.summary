-- @entity2 ' career as a player - manager got off to a winning start as @entity5 defeated relegation - threatened @entity6 at @entity7			1
the @entity5 legend is temporarily at the helm of the @entity10 after @entity11 was sacked on tuesday			2
@entity2 chose not to select himself for his first game in charge and instead watched from the dugout as his side , which bore six changes from last week 's loss at @entity18 , cruised to a comfortable 4 - 0 victory			1
@entity20 opened the scoring from the penalty spot after 40 minutes and then added a second two minutes after the break			0
substitute @entity24 knocked in a @entity26 center after 62 minutes to make it three before stooping to claim his own quickfire brace after @entity28 rifled across goal 10 minutes later			0
the win matched @entity5 's biggest victory of the season and saw the them register more shots on target than in any other league game under @entity11			2
speaking to @entity37 after the game , @entity2 revealed he had struggled to sleep the night before and dreaded telling the players who would miss out of his team selection			2
" leaving the likes of @entity24 out of the starting 11 was difficult and a position i 've never been in before			0
i 'm also one of their team - mates			0
i told them all individually and some of them were upset , but they did n't sulk			0
" it 's good to end the day as we did , scoring goals and creating chances , " he added			0
" i reminded the players the tempo needed to be quicker at half - time and they reacted well to that			0
" while delighted with the result , which was @entity5 's first win since early april , @entity2 also said he was equally pleased with his team 's performance			1
@entity5 looked sharper , faster and more penetrative with their passing than they have in recent weeks , particularly after taking the lead			0
@entity6 had coped well up until then although the breakthrough arrived after some calamitous defending by the visitors			0
three @entity6 players missed opportunities to clear a weak cross into the box before the ball fell to the feet of @entity5 striker , @entity70 , who was duly hauled down by @entity71 as he was about to shoot			1
referee @entity72 pointed to the spot and @entity20 stepped up to send @entity6 keeper @entity74 the wrong way			1
the second half began just as the first ended with @entity20 pushing forward and curling a shot beyond @entity74 from 20 - yards out			2
@entity2 then brought on @entity24 who had dropped to the bench after last week 's defeat at @entity18 and the @entity82 international made it 3 - 0 just after the hour , knocking in a @entity26 cross			1
@entity6 were well beaten by this stage and a @entity24 header after @entity87 fired across goal made it four shortly after			1
@entity20 and @entity89 came close in the final ten minutes for @entity5 while a deflected shot from @entity6 's @entity91 rebounded off the bar but the game would finish without any further scoring			1
@entity6 remain a point above the relegation zone in 16th position with two games to play after @entity99 blew a two goal lead at home to @entity103 finalists @entity104 earlier in the day , spurning the chance to move above the @entity6			1
@entity99 were two up with 15 minutes to play thanks to second - half strikes from @entity108 and @entity109 but late goals from @entity104 's @entity111 and @entity112 snatched a draw			2
elsewhere in @entity115 , @entity114 took a step closer to @entity118 survival with a 1 - 0 home victory over @entity120 while @entity122 's poor run of form continued as they were defeated 4 - 1 at @entity124			1
in saturday 's lunch time kick - off , @entity18 's @entity126 hopes took a blow as they slumped to defeat at @entity130			0
own goals from @entity18 defenders @entity133 and @entity134 were enough to seal a 2 - 0 victory for the @entity130			1
a victory for @entity137 at 10 - man @entity138 means they now trail fifth placed @entity18 by just three points			0
