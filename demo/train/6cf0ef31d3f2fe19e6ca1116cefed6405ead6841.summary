-- occupy activists tossed pipes , bottles , burning flares and other objects saturday at @entity7 police , who responded by using tear gas and smoke grenades and arresting more than 100 demonstrators , city and police officials said			1
@entity7 has been a flash point of the occupy movement since october when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown			1
one demonstrator , a @entity20 veteran of the war in @entity22 , suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile , according to a veteran 's group			0
police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers			1
on saturday , police made mass arrests following an afternoon clash with protesters near the @entity34 and then later outside a downtown @entity35 , according to a police statement			2
the tension began saturday around noon when about 250 activists gathered in @entity39			0
they were joined later by another 200 people as they marched around the city			0
police said the protesters " began tearing down perimeter fences around " the @entity44 around 2:30 p.m. , with officers ordering the protesters to leave the area about 20 minutes later			2
" @entity50 of @entity7 welcomes peaceful forms of assembly and freedom of speech , but acts of violence , property destruction and overnight lodging will not be tolerated , " the statement said			2
on its @entity60 feed , @entity7 police wrote that people near the @entity35 were being arrested for unlawful assembly			1
police claimed , too , that parts of the @entity64 and @entity44 were " severely impacted , " with people cutting and tearing fences			0
occupy protesters also blocked traffic at major intersections and attacked a @entity72 television truck , damaging the truck and breaking windows , the station said			1
by nightfall , occupy protesters moved toward @entity77 , according to the group 's @entity60 feed			1
we didnt get in the building , but fought like our future depended on it , " the group tweeted			0
posts on @entity85 's @entity60 feed claim that police met the protesters " with munitions and violence			2
" one read : " # @entity92 being teargassed smoked bombed & shot at w rubber bullets			1
" @entity7 police said they used only smoke and tear gas			1
they did so after warning activists who had begun " destroying construction equipment and fencing " around the @entity44 , authorities said			0
officers were " pelted " with bottles , metal pipes , rocks and burning flares , according to another police statement released earlier in the day			1
while there was no immediate word on injuries to protesters , @entity7 police said that three of their officers were hurt in the earlier clash			1
after that incident , roughly 500 activists returned to @entity39 , according to a police statement			2
aerial video footage showed them later on the move and a post on @entity85 's @entity60 feed indicated they were planning to march to a " second building " -- an apparent reference to the @entity35			0
while touting the action as " @entity126 " on their website , @entity128 , organizers did not state what " large , vacant " building they planned to occupy			2
they also acknowledged that " like the encampment at @entity39 , the building move - in is not legal			0
" but the group said the move was necessary , in part because " since november , the city of @entity7 and its police force have made it impossible for us to meet , to serve food , and to provide a place for people to stay			2
" " @entity85 is about people providing for themselves and for others , since it is clear that the system can no longer provide for them , " the group said on its website			0
" it is a place where people who are fed up can come together and develop new forms of struggle			0
" in a letter to mayor @entity153 , the city council and the @entity7 police department , protesters threatened several actions if authorities try to " evict us again			1
" they included " blockading the airport indefinitely , occupying @entity77 indefinitely , shutting down the @entity7 ports " and getting help from the activist hacking group known as @entity162			1
in mid-december , occupy protesters shut down the @entity7 port terminal			1
following october 's clashes with protesters , police chief @entity165 said " all allegations of misconduct and excessive uses of forces are being thoroughly investigated by internal and external investigative sources , " according to a letter posted on the department 's website			0
the website also solicits " input ... about police interactions with protesters during the @entity85 protests			0
" people are asked to contact the independent investigator who is looking into authorities ' actions in october and november 2011			0
