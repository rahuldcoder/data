police officers in @entity9 , @entity4 , found @entity11 's body shortly after 9 a.m. friday on the floor of a storage room in his garage			1

" he left a suicide note , and we are verifying its validity			0
" authorities have n't disclosed the contents of that note or why @entity11 might have taken his life			2
yet the lawyer and @entity4 @entity31 leader has been under fire for the past month , having been charged with three others -- according to @entity35 newspaper -- in connection to a blogger accused of taking a picture of sen. @entity40 's wife in her nursing home bed			1
this came a week after the blogger , @entity43 , was himself charged			0
all were apparent allies of conservative state sen. @entity45 , who was then engaged in an ugly primary battle to see who would be the @entity51 @entity50 candidate from @entity4			2
the photo of @entity40 's wife -- who suffers from dementia and has lived in a nursing home for 14 years -- surfaced in a political attack ad on @entity58 that aimed to smear @entity40 , @entity35 reported			1
it 's unclear how the photo was used because the ad was removed within hours of being posted , according to the newspaper			0
this episode and others further inflamed the rhetoric in the primary fight			0

" but on friday , @entity40 -- who narrowly edged @entity45 in tuesday 's primary -- and his team showed only sympathy upon hearing about @entity11 's death			1
" this is very much a tragic and sad situation , " said @entity78 , a senior adviser to @entity40 's campaign			1
" @entity11 was a really good guy			2
on behalf of sen. @entity40 and all of us for the campaign , our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his friends			1
" report : @entity11 faced conspiracy charges @entity11 leaves behind his wife and two children			2
he also leaves a legacy in @entity4 in other ways , as a lawyer and a political leader			2
the @entity4 @entity31 remembered him as one of its founding members " and one of our biggest cheerleaders			1
" " he had a patriot 's soul , and a smile that was as big as day , " the group said on its website			1

@entity116 's arrest shakes up @entity51 primary @entity11 was later arrested along with @entity118 , an elementary school @entity119 teacher and high school coach , according to @entity35 newspaper			2
police also charged a third individual , @entity124 , but did not take him into custody because of " extensive medical conditions			0
" all three face conspiracy charges , the newspaper reported			0
@entity11 's death came two days after the runoff to decide his state 's @entity50 nominee -- an election necessitated since neither @entity40 nor @entity45 cracked 50 % in the june 3 primary			1
@entity40 won the latest contest by fewer than 7,000 votes , aided by @entity136 who were actively courted during the runoff campaign by @entity140 forces			0
according to @entity4 law , voters are not required to register with a political party , and anyone who does n't vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party 's runoff			2

@entity11 's attorney , @entity165 , said in a statement e-mailed to @entity0 that he was a client " but more importantly , he was a friend for almost 34 years			1
" my heart is completely broken			0
this is beyond tragic and the people of this community and state have lost a good man and citizen			0
" in a phone call with @entity0 , @entity165 added , " it 's not important to me how it happened			0
@entity11 's wife called and texted me that @entity11 was deceased			1
" and @entity45 posted a statement on his @entity182 page saying that , " regardless of recent allegations made against his character , @entity11 was a fine @entity186 man who was always respectful and kind			0
" " he was one of the most polite and humble men i 've ever met in politics , " the state senator added			0
