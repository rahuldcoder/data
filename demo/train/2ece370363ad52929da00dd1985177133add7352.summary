if you 're going to work for the water department in @entity3 , you better learn how to hold it			1
that 's what the city 's water utility advises after a manager was caught relieving himself into a reservoir that supplies water to millions of people			1
last month , employees with the @entity13 witnessed @entity14 , a $ 111,000 - a - year maintenance planner with the utility , urinate in the @entity17 , said @entity18 , a spokesman for the utilities commission			1
the @entity20 is a 674 million - gallon basin , located about 150 miles east of @entity3 , that provides water for 2.6 million people in the @entity24			1
the water in the reservoir is untreated and disinfected with chlorine and ultraviolet light before it reaches customers			2
there was no water in the reservoir at the time of @entity14 's bathroom break -- it had been drained for maintenance , @entity18 said -- but that made no difference			2
" there is no public health risk to be concerned about because the reservoir was not in use and the fact any water would have been treated anyway , " said @entity18			1
" still , his actions are completely unacceptable			0
" @entity14 is facing disciplinary action from the utility , which could include several days of suspension without pay			0
@entity3 is n't the only city that 's had to deal with this			2
last april , @entity50 , @entity51 , was forced to dump 38 million gallons of water from a reservoir after a teen urinated in it			2
a security camera captured the 19 - year - old , with the help of two friends , climbing a fence surrounding the reservoir and , ahem , taking care of business			0
the city decided to get rid of the water in the reservoir because it was slated to go directly to homes and there was no way to treat it			0
the teen and his two accomplices were cited by police			0
as for @entity14 or any other employees in @entity3 who may be working around a reservoir and want to save themselves a trip to the restroom , @entity18 offers a warning			1
" come to work wearing your big boy pants or diapers			0
if not , you 'll need to find another place to work			0
