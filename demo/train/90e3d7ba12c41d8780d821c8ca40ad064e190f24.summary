-- @entity1 and @entity1 were n't in the @entity3 courtroom thursday for the sentencing of their captor , @entity1			1
but their words , recorded in diaries , gave authorities a window into the horror they suffered for a decade			0
@entity13 prosecutor @entity12 wrote about the diaries in a sentencing memo			1
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity1 did " everything humanly possible to retain a sense of normalcy " @entity12 said , including marking the passage of time through written diaries			1
the diaries provide further details of the women 's life and torment			1
@entity12 reveals that one diary 's descriptions of abuse provided evidence his office used for many of the specific counts against @entity1			2
@entity1 has pleaded guilty to 937 counts of kidnapping , rape and murder			2
diaries kept by the women contain descriptions of these crimes , including sexual abuse , being locked in a dark room and being chained to a wall			0
@entity12 says other entries contain anticipation of abuse yet to come , including @entity1 's death threats			1
but the diaries also showed traces of hope , including " the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family			0
" @entity1 's entries focused on her mother , according to psychiatrist @entity59 's assessment of the women 's captivity as part of the sentencing statement			1
@entity59 , an expert in trauma , wrote that the diaries showed the women 's " will to prevail			1
" according to @entity59 , @entity16 addressed almost every entry in her diary to her mother			0
@entity16 's mother , @entity70 , worked tirelessly to find her daughter			0
@entity70 died of heart failure in 2006 ; those who knew her said it was more like a broken heart			0
after @entity16 learned of her mother 's death , she began addressing her entries to " her mother in heaven			0
" the entries show @entity16 at once seeking to " soothe her mother as she prayed for her own deliverance and the health of her little girl			0
" @entity16 's daughter , fathered by @entity1 , was born on christmas day of 2006			2
@entity12 writes that " when the baby was born she was not breathing			0
@entity1 breathed into the baby 's mouth in an effort to save her			2
" a difficult endeavor , made more intense by @entity1 's threat to kill @entity1 should the baby die			1
" miraculously , " @entity12 writes , " the baby survived			0
" the sentencing memo provides other descriptions of heroism			1
@entity59 says that @entity1 , in addition to serving as a de facto doctor to @entity16 , also " interceded when @entity1 sought to abuse @entity98			1
" an action , @entity59 says , that resulted in further physical and sexual trauma for @entity1			1
@entity59 said that " on rare occasions all four captives were allowed to be together and they managed to share faith and friendship			2
" he also noted that @entity16 managed to pass on knowledge and values to her daughter , something the other two women supported " when possible			0
" but @entity59 says the bright moments , the remarkable and inspiring ones , should not " paint a rosy picture for normalcy or quick recovery			0
" @entity1 , @entity59 writes , " turned truth and commonsense on its head and fed that to his captives			1
" the beatings , the repeated rapes , the forced miscarriages and the deprivation of basic human sanitation led to complex post-traumatic stress disorder			0
" it is the result of victimization over a long period of time , " @entity59 says , " or in the years when personality and character are being formed			0
" @entity1 " appeared to be evolving in an ever more dangerous direction , " @entity59 writes , " capturing younger and younger women , telling his captives he was hunting for replacements			1
" the women must have known that any new captives would not have meant freedom -- rather they must have known , @entity59 concludes , " replacement meant death			2
