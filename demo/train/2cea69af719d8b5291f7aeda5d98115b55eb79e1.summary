-- a @entity2 performer emerged victorious in the @entity3 on saturday , beating out competition from 25 other nations			1
@entity6 , 28 , won for " @entity7 , " an upbeat dance - style song			1
dressed in dark colors , she sang in shadows , playing off flashing lights , wind and snow			2
" i want to say that i love you so much			2
thank you for believing in me , " she said soon after winning , addressing her fans			2
" this is not just mine			2
" the annual event attracts an estimated global audience of 125 million and is loved for its combination of over-the - top costumes , kitsch pop songs , sometimes dubious talent and international rivalries			2
among the more unusual contenders this year was @entity29 , a group of self - described grannies from @entity31			0
dressed in flowing skirts and sensible shoes , they performed a choreographed baking routine			0
@entity31 finished second behind @entity2			1
@entity35 won third with a performance by @entity37			0
@entity38 , @entity40 's entry , sang " @entity43 , " ripping off a blindfold as he broke into dance			0
yet for all its entertainment value , talk in the run - up to this year 's contest was dominated by where it was being held -- @entity50 -- as its performers			1
the host nation generally uses the event to promote itself to tourists and foreign investors			0
but this year , human rights activists have questioned whether @entity50 , formerly part of the @entity58 , should have been allowed to host the contest given what they describe as its poor record on freedom of expression			1
@entity66 last month urged the contest 's organizers and other nations to put pressure on @entity50 's government to prevent " violence against journalists , social media activists , and human rights defenders ; refrain from using politically - motivated criminal charges against journalists and others ; release people imprisoned on politically - motivated charges ; and allow peaceful assemblies			1
" at present , @entity50 " remains hostile towards free media and other forms of free expression , " the group said			1
" police have violently dispersed protests , beating and arresting peaceful demonstrators and organizers			0
" @entity50 ranks 162 out of 179 countries in the latest @entity91 compiled by @entity92			1
rights advocacy group @entity93 says 12 people are currently in prison in @entity50 because of their connection to anti-government protests held last year			1
eleven of the prisoners began a hunger strike on 15 may that they intended to maintain until the end of the @entity3 , @entity93 said			0
it was not immediately what has or will happen , with the talent show now complete			0
@entity50 's ambassador to the @entity105 , @entity104 , told @entity0 that human rights are guaranteed by his country 's constitution , but admitted there are problems			1
" we are only 10 years old , and we are building a democratic society , " he said prior to the event , which he promised would showcase his country 's culture and hospitality			0
" it 's a long way to go			0
it 's not easy , it 's very challenging			0
" @entity119 , a former political prisoner in @entity50 now studying in @entity120 , accused the government of detaining a few individuals on politically - motivated grounds in order to scare other people			1
he told @entity0 he 'd hoped performers on the live show would comment on the human rights situation in @entity50 -- a statement that would be seen by tens of millions of people -- but that did n't happen			1
despite the " @entity134 - " prefix , contestants can come from any member country of the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) that includes numerous @entity140 nations , some , like @entity50 , from central @entity142			1
the @entity137 is made up of broadcasters , not governments , and each year it is up to the participating broadcaster from each country to submit one act chosen through their own selection process			0
with @entity6 's victory saturday , @entity2 joins @entity152 , the @entity105 and @entity153 as countries that have recorded five wins			1
they all trail @entity157 , whose contestants have walked away with the top prize seven times , including a run of three consecutive victories in 1992 , 1993 and 1994			0
the voting that led to @entity6 's win began after all the finalists performed			1
countries were awarded a set of points from one to eight , then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs			2
voters could not select performers from their own countries , and the scores were announced in both @entity174 and @entity152			2
television viewers cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines , which count toward the final vote			1
many perceive the voting to be tactical , with neighbors or members of regional blocs , such as the former @entity58 nations , appearing to base their scoring on geopolitical alliances rather than artistic merit			0
most winning acts or artists go on to sink without trace			0
among the few notable exceptions are @entity193 , who won in 1974 with " @entity195 , " and @entity196 , who was imported from @entity198 to represent @entity199 in the 1988 contest			2
@entity0 's @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			0
