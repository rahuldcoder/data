" @entity3 " made its tv debut in 1983 with a simple idea : use television to keep kids reading during summer by urging them to " take a look " in a book			1
the popular public television show ended its run in 2009 , but host and actor @entity10 has n't stepped away from children 's literacy , or the ideas behind the beloved show			1
on wednesday , @entity10 launched a $ 1 million @entity17 campaign to raise money for a web - based digital library of " @entity3 " books and videos			1
it exceeded its fund - raising goal by the end of the first day			2
@entity10 said the new tool will allow more children and educators to access " @entity3 " materials , beyond those using the popular " @entity3 " mobile app. the web version will be accessible through a subscription , but aims to provide " @entity3 " for free to disadvantaged classrooms			1
" if you are a reader , then you have the ability to educate yourself , " @entity10 said			2
" when you have the ability to be a lifelong learner , there are no limits on what you can acquire in terms of knowledge and information			0
it represents the ultimate freedom of mankind			0
" after all , what makes a good story has n't changed much since " @entity3 's " debut , @entity10 said			1
@entity10 said he realized the power of tv as a medium for educating and informing viewers when he played @entity56 on the " roots " miniseries , based on @entity59 's novel about slavery and african - american history			2
the story captured the nation as millions tuned in to watch the miniseries during the late 1970s			0
decades later , after reading a book on an @entity66 for the first time , he saw the potential to create an interactive reading experience			0

he launched the " @entity3 " app in 2012 , and in its first 18 months , users read 10 million books , making it the no. 1 free educational app in the @entity83 for two years			1
" i wanted to put in the hands of kids a library of books and videos , like the tv show did , all in the service of inspiring a love of literature and exploring the world -- connecting the real world to the literature that kids are reading , " said @entity10 , who received the @entity84 for his efforts to instill " a lifelong love of reading in children " during @entity88 this month			1
@entity10 's efforts come at a time when researchers and educators are trying to figure out how to use technology to encourage reading			2
since 1984 , the proportion of adolescents who read for pleasure once a week or more has dropped from 81 % to 76 % among 9 - year - olds , according to research released this week by advocacy group @entity113			2
among 13 - year - olds , rates of reading for pleasure have dropped from 70 % to 53 %			0
among 17 - year - olds , the rate dropped from 64 % to 40 %			0
the proportion who say they " never " or " hardly ever " read has gone from 8 % of 13 - year - olds and 9 % of 17 - year - olds in 1984 to 22 % and 27 % , respectively			0
" e-reading has the potential to significantly change the nature of reading for children and families , but its impact is still unknown , " said the @entity113 report " children , @entity133 and @entity134			0
" on the tv show , @entity10 became a trusted friend to children , parents and educators , recommending a variety of books and taking viewers on book - related field trips			1
he invited kids to recommend books in a segment , using the famous line , " but you do n't have to take my word for it			0
" " the books were enhanced by the show and the show brought people to read the books , " said @entity151 , president of the @entity152			1
" it sort of lays the groundwork for research later in life because @entity10 always took those books , found out something about them and went further			1
" in the app incarnation of " @entity3 , " children navigate the app in a virtual hot air balloon , traveling to themed islands and discovering books they might like to read			1
the app hosts more than 500 books and video field trips with @entity10			1
users can interact with the stories like it 's a game and receive rewards for each book they read			2
parents are encouraged to use the app along with their children , filling in youngsters ' interests for reading recommendations or exploring lessons and themes within the books together			1
kids can read by themselves , with their parents or have @entity10 narrate			2
the app is free to download , with a $ 9.99 monthly or $ 29.99 six - month fee for accessing and downloading unlimited books to read			1
" elementary school - age children are at a juncture where you have such a great opportunity to capture them as readers at that point , " said @entity193 of the @entity194			0
" the app has struck that ideal balance between enhancing the storytelling without being distracting			0
" @entity10 said he hopes the web - based version of " @entity3 " will be tailored to classroom teachers and homeschoolers			1
it will include lesson plans and tools to track students ' reading progress			0
@entity10 said he also would like to see more diversity in children 's literature			2
" @entity3 " will continue to share a variety of books , just as he did on the show , he said			1
" i firmly believe that seeing oneself reflected in the popular culture is critically important for developing a solid and healthy sense of self , " he said			0
" unless the publishing industry is proactive , this will be one of the causes of its demise			0
i do n't understand the reluctance			0
here is a sector that is woefully underserved , with an opportunity to target a market that is thirsty for literature			0
" still , not everything has changed			0
just as @entity10 's mother nurtured his interest in reading , parents and children can bond through books , whether on paper or tablets			1
" there is nothing more powerful to me than that elemental experience of storytelling : being read to aloud , following along , seeing the story in the pictures and feeling it in your heart , " @entity10 said			2
" it is really beautifully , brilliantly embodied in the sharing of a children 's book			0
" what were your favorite books as a young reader ? share your memories in the comments , on @entity260 or on @entity262 's facebook page .			0

" @entity3 " is off the air , but @entity10 continues to promote child literacy
