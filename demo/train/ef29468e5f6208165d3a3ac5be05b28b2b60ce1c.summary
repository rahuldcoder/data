-- the @entity1 is a faith - based , nonprofit organization formed when area churches wanted to help people hurt by the 1970s steel plant closings on the @entity6 of @entity7			1
it offers job training and literacy programs			2
it 's working with @entity10 and area municipalities on an infrastructure project designed to address the region 's growing population and create jobs			2
and its first executive director was @entity17			1
@entity17 : my vision for @entity20 that 's right , the man often accused of being a @entity22 spent years working for a @entity25 organization			1
the man who supposedly only wants to give handouts to people spent years empowering them through education			0
the man @entity32 accuse of only caring about himself spent his entire adult life helping those less fortunate			1
true , his first term as president has not come without its disappointments			1
he said he would cut the deficit -- he has n't			0
he said his administration would not be politics as usual and then he played politics with immigration reform and gay rights			0
and @entity43 is still open			0
but before he was president or senator or even an @entity46 state representative , @entity17 was a young man with a degree from @entity48 who could have done just about anything he wanted , and he chose to go back to his adopted home of @entity7 and help poor people			1
politics : if @entity17 wins ... a politician 's record is not confined to what he or she does in office			1
that 's important , but it 's an abbreviated version co-authored by consultants and edited by poll numbers			2
to really understand a candidate , voters have to look at the original , unabridged manuscript , the record he or she began writing before realizing someone else might read it			2
i did n't vote for @entity17 in 2008 because he was n't @entity72			1
i did n't vote for him out of racial solidarity or because he gives pretty speeches			0
i voted for @entity17 in 2008 for the same reason why i voted for him in 2012 -- his record			1
and his time as a community organizer is part of that of record			2
sure , i could rely on numbers to present a strong argument for a second term			1
about this time four years ago , the country lost 159,000 jobs , the country 's ninth consecutive month of job loss			0
last week we learned we created 171,000 jobs , the 25th consecutive month of job growth			0
regardless of party , i would think that would be seen as a good thing			2
our housing prices have rebounded to where they were nine years ago , and the @entity97 recently closed at its highest mark in five years			1
i could also point to the death of @entity100 or the currency collapse in @entity102 because of the sanctions that he 's led			0
but to fully understand why i voted for @entity17 , one only needs to look at this quote from author @entity106 : " our character is what we do when we think no one is looking			1
" opinion : what 's really at stake in election 2012 when no one was looking , @entity17 was a humble community organizer fighting for poor @entity20 who had lost their jobs			1
four years ago , his critics mocked him for that			0
today , we see a lot has changed about him ... but not that			0
he is still fighting for those @entity20 who are hurting , and it gives me a measure of peace knowing that the person in charge of making tough budget cuts has a record of working with people who are hurting			2
i 'm sure @entity130 is a decent man , and he 's given millions to his church			1
but i ca n't shake the fact the self - proclaimed " son of @entity135 " did not come around the city when it began to struggle in the 1980s			2
the great " job creator " did nothing for the city when it was hemorrhaging jobs in the 1990s and to this day he only seems to come around @entity135 during election time			2
if this is how the " son " treats family , i can only imagine the disregard he holds for strangers			0
actually i do n't have to imagine			0
i watched the 47 % video			0
the one that was taped when he thought no one outside of the room would be listening			0
this is why he 's trailing in @entity152 and @entity153 , the two states to which he 's most closely tied			2
it 's not because he 's @entity32			0
the three @entity153 governors before @entity130 were @entity32 , while four of the past six governors in @entity152 were @entity32 , including his father			1
he trails because the people there know him			0
not the manicured version he presents on the campaign trail , but the unabridged version he began writing before his life in politics began			0
the version all future politicians script with the decisions that they make			0
i 'm not wearing blinders			0
i know @entity17 is just as flawed as @entity130			1
how can he not be ? but at the end of the day i 'd rather have president @entity17 in the @entity177 , someone with a record of being about the work of helping others before he was in office , than @entity130 , someone who has a record of talking about it once he got there			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			1

@entity187 : in @entity7 , @entity17 directed faith - based group to help displaced workers
he says @entity17 not *perfect* , but his early choices showed will to help those in need
he says there are good reasons for another term : @entity200 numbers , housing prices
@entity203 : @entity130 shows up in home states in election ; @entity17 has record of helping others
