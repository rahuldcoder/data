-- on thursday , we will link arms with more than 100 women and claim the street outside the @entity5			2
we will not move until the @entity5 recognizes that women and children are at the heart of the immigration debate , and reform must treat them fairly			2
women and children constitute three - quarters of all immigrants to the @entity12 , but the debate about immigration reform -- which has stalled in the @entity5 -- has largely ignored the disproportionate burden they bear in a system that is failing			1
immigrant women make outsize contributions to our families , communities and country			1
but they are denied core @entity12 values -- the right to equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law			1
although women make up 51 % of @entity12 immigrants , only 28 % of work visas are given to them as principal holders			1
women disproportionately work in paperless or informal economies -- as nannies , housekeepers , home health care workers -- that do n't get awarded work visas			1
these jobs rarely provide proof of employment , such as a pay stub at the end of the week			0
while many immigrant men face this challenge as well , women are disproportionately affected by it			2
immigration reform efforts that link eligibility for citizenship to proof of employment fail to recognize the essential work that many immigrant women provide in these crucial roles			1
the @entity54 bill allows for alternative ways to verify employment , such as an affidavit from a church or community - based nonprofit			0
and a bipartisan group of 13 women senators also recognized the need for a merit - based visa system that would include professions that women predominantly occupy			0
unfortunately their amendment did not make it into the @entity54 bill			0
because they so rarely get work visas , most immigrant women enter the @entity12 as dependents on their spouses ' visas and they are prohibited from working			1
this not only prevents many women from contributing their considerable talents and skills , it makes their immigration status entirely dependent on another person , creating a situation primed for abuse			2
an immigrant woman in an abusive relationship may not report her spouse to authorities or seek help for fear that she will lose her ability to remain in the country			0
a comprehensive reform bill should ensure that women have equal opportunity to receive work visas by allocating them among employment categories typically held by women , not just professions typically held by men			1
as baby boomers reach retirement age , the need for caregivers and domestic workers will skyrocket			0
though these jobs are essential and in high demand , they are often less valued than the jobs -- typically held by men -- that are awarded work visas , such as in tech and finance			1
the way that most women enter the @entity12 is through the family - based visa system			2
in fact , nearly 70 % of immigrant women attain legal status this way			1
unfortunately , the family visa system has an enormous backlog -- about 4 million people are stuck in it , the majority of whom are women and children			0
some women are forced to wait for decades before being reunited with their families -- something that is unbearable even to contemplate for most parents			0
comprehensive immigration must clear this backlog and keep families together			0
we were reminded during the 50th anniversary commemoration of the march on @entity135 that the most difficult and enduring change requires the personal commitment and courage of individuals acting together			0
as the rev. @entity140 and other great leaders showed us , from time to time that can mean the willingness to be arrested for standing up for your most deeply held values and beliefs			0
inspired by @entity140 and the campaigns that made up the civil rights movement , we are putting ourselves on the line at the @entity150 as part of a national campaign , we belong together , to promote immigration laws that treat women fairly , that reflect our core @entity12 values			1
if they do n't , we are diminished as a nation			0
real reform includes a path to citizenship , keeps families together and upholds the family immigration system , provides protections for survivors of violence and against workplace abuses , protects the health and well - being of women and children , honors women 's work inside and out of the home , and is not driven by a focus on enforcement			1
every day , immigrant women from all walks of life demonstrate incredible courage and take enormous risks to contribute to the well - being and success of their families and loved ones			1
they move to the @entity12 to give their children better lives ; they work so that their families will have food on the table ; they take care of the young and the old ; they open businesses			2
@entity188 is a story that defines this country			0
while the majority of @entity12 recognize that the time is now to fix our immigration system , the @entity5 has not acted			2
it seems intent on piecemeal measures that continue to keep women from contributing fully and keeping their families together			0
if getting arrested is what it takes to show the @entity5 we 're serious , it 's worth it			0
@entity5 members must have courage and unite , as we have , to pass immigration reform that treats women fairly and keeps families united			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 and @entity211 .			2

@entity210 , @entity211 say immigration reform must bring equal treatment for women
they say only 28 % of work visas go to women , who do jobs that often are n't valued
they say reform should free up visas for those jobs -- nannies and home health care workers
writers : immigrant women make huge contributions to @entity12 and need an equal shot
