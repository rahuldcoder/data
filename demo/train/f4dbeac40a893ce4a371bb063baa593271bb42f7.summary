-- the powerful @entity1 has decided that , because of the $ 700 billion financial - system bailout , it wants to organize bank workers			1
banks that get taxpayer money need to " ensure their workers have a voice , " a union spokeswoman says			1
in an e-mail dated november 12 and obtained exclusively by @entity0 , a member of @entity1 's @entity12 outlined initial discussions to organize bank workers " since the banking industry is now being infused with billions of taxpayer dollars			1
" the e-mail was written by @entity1 's @entity17 to the director of the @entity20 office of the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , a longtime ally and partner of the union			1
" we need to get a handle on who these workers are , working conditions , etc. , " @entity17 wrote			0
" do you have @entity21 members who work for banks or @entity34 / @entity33 ? is there anyway [ sic ] you could check ? the banks we 're most concerned about are : -- @entity33 -- @entity34 -- @entity39 / @entity40 -- @entity41 -- @entity42 -- @entity44 / @entity43 -- @entity46 / @entity45 -- @entity47 / @entity48 -- @entity49 " please let me know and if you have other suggestions , i 'd love to hear them			2
" @entity17 referred questions to a union spokeswoman , who confirmed the authenticity of the e-mail and that the union is considering targeting the banks for unionizing			1
" we believe there is special responsibility for companies who receive taxpayer dollars to ensure their workers have a voice on the job , " @entity1 's @entity61 said			1
" and those workers should have a seat at the table at the companies where decisions that impact the future of their families and the companies that employ them " are made			0
" we are talking to workers really broadly in banking , " she said			0
@entity1 is the fastest - growing trade union in @entity83 , according to its own web site , with a membership of more than 2 million , including health - care industry workers and state and local government employees			1
it also represents guards and janitors who work in commercial and residential properties			0
and its clout continues to grow			0
@entity1 's $ 85 million in political donations made it the single - largest contributor to either party in the recent elections			1
the union worked vigorously for the election of @entity99 , who has named a former union official as his @entity102 political director , a post once held in the @entity105 administration by @entity106			0
the official , @entity107 , formerly was executive vice president of politics and legislation for local 1199 , the @entity1 's @entity110			1
@entity1 , which broke away from the @entity111 in 2005 , is known for its successful but sometimes controversial tactics : it often targets private equity groups ' leaders , as well as banks and companies , with loud and demonstrative rallies			1
the union 's hierarchy has made no secret it hopes to grow under the incoming @entity122 administration			2
" i would say that we 've been very vocal about the optimism about the new administration , " @entity1 's @entity123 said			1
" there are a number of newly elected members of @entity130 who agree with us on matters relating to working families			0
" one labor professor said @entity1 's timing in trying to unionize bank workers may be on target " because financial institutions are at a moment of weakness			1
" " low - wage earners are the growing sector of the work force , " said @entity141 , an economics professor at @entity142 and director of its labor studies program			0
" this is a very shrewd political move to tie this to the bailouts			0
" @entity141 said unions tend not to do well in attracting workers during economic recessions because jobs are scarce then			0
but he said recent surveys indicate a majority of workers would consider organizing , so the public 's appetite for unions may be on the upswing			2
" bank teller jobs are one of the few jobs that are actually growing , " @entity141 said			0
" and they are low - wage earners , so it makes sense that it fits into the @entity1 model			2
@entity1 has been very opportunistic in growing its membership			2
" the median annual earnings of bank tellers was about $ 22,000 in may 2006 , according to the @entity175 @entity174			0
a spokesman for the @entity177 said it had no one who could comment on labor issues			0
he said the association represents 95 percent of the industry 's $ 13.6 trillion in assets .			2
