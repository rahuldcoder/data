follow the team on @entity9			0
londonwhen it comes to getting ready for a show , fast - rising @entity3 comedian @entity10 has it all figured out			1
" my ideal setting is i walk from the streets , backstage and straight onto the stage , " says @entity10 , who last year became the first @entity3 comedian to perform on @entity16 's @entity15 in the @entity17			1
" two minutes and i am on the stage			0
that way in my head i have gone from my world and then into a social setting with my friends			0
i want my audience to be my friends -- that is when they will get the best comedy			0
if they see me as a performer , they wo n't get the best show			0
" at just 28 years old , @entity10 is already a big name in his country 's fledgling standup scene , as well as a cover star for @entity38 @entity3			1
but despite treating the audience as friends , he 's not afraid of provocative subject matter , with his latest show called " the @entity43			2
" watch @entity10 's standup the son of a black @entity3 woman and a white @entity48 man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in @entity3 , @entity10 jokes that he was " born a crime			1
" on stage , he draws upon his particular life experiences to tackle thorny issues with his funny , and sometimes trenchant , punchlines			0
" my mom would be arrested , she would be fined and still she was like ' ooh , i do n't care , i want a white man , ooh , ' " he tells a laughing audience gathered in @entity61 's @entity60			2
" and my dad was also like , well , you know how the @entity48 love chocolate			0
" @entity10 's mixed - race heritage defines his routine			1
race and ethnicity are leading themes in his standup , echoing his life while growing up in @entity72 during the apartheid years and being labeled mixed race			1
" in the streets my father could n't walk with us -- he would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me -- like a creepy pedophile , " he tells the @entity60 crowd			0
" and my mom could walk with me but every time the police went by she would drop me -- i felt like a bag of weed			0
" last year , @entity86 comedy supremo @entity85 took @entity10 to perform at the @entity87 , the biggest arts festival in the world			2
@entity10 's performance was one of the festival 's talking points , enabling the comedian to return later to the @entity86 and perform " @entity43 " to a wider audience			1
for his @entity86 tour , @entity10 tailored his standup for an international crowd			1
he says that @entity3 had been living on a high during the years immediately following apartheid , but now that the " honeymoon period is over " many of the country 's problems have re-appeared			1
" a lot of racial tension has resurfaced but it is not that it was gone , " he says			0
" it 's just that because we were having so much fun we did n't have enough time to pay attention to it and now because there is nothing , we realize there is still a lot of racial tension in the country			2
" that is why in my [ @entity3 ] show ' that 's @entity119 , ' i just love to talk about that			1
i believe if you want to talk about it , it is so much easier instead of acting like it 's not there			2
" @entity10 says he does n't write down any of his material			2
instead , he prepares his routine by " living life " and evolving the stories that are of interest to him			0
" i like to forge the story in my head , " he says			0
" most of my show is true , like 90 % of everything i say on stage is true , i just have to find the way to make it funny , that 's the difficult thing			0
" @entity10 's quick rise to success was documented in " you laugh but it 's true , " a film chronicling the days leading up to @entity10 's first one - man show in @entity145 , in 2009			1
working to raise his international profile , @entity10 lived in the @entity17 for a year , where he also made his successful appearance on the hugely popular @entity15			1
" that was a big moment , " remembers @entity10			2
" but i think bigger than just being on @entity15 for me i was proud to say that i 'm the first @entity3 that 's on @entity15 , the first @entity3 comedian performing , a live performer doing the thing which people had n't seen			1
it was so nice to say that look , this is possible			0
" he returned to @entity3 last june , where he uses his @entity17 experience to enhance his act			2
" comedy is really getting quite popular in @entity3 , " says @entity10			1
" it 's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream , which is very good			0
i think the reason it 's doing so well is because @entity3 need to laugh and @entity3 want to laugh			1
" we have a lot of stories to share , we have a lot to learn about each other because we were separated for so long , so now we 're trying to understand who we are and who everyone around us is as well			0
comedy is a great tool for that because if you laugh with people you start to understand that you share more with them than you thought did initially and you learn about them as well			0
