-- @entity1 , mother of five and daughter of coal country , believes that in this presidential election , her way of life is at stake			2
" if you ask anybody in the coal industry what would happen if @entity18 is re-elected , they 'd say the coal industry is done , " said @entity1 , whose husband , @entity8 , is a coal miner and whose family has depended on the industry for at least four generations			1
@entity1 lives in @entity20 , @entity21 , which sits on top of one of the state 's richest coal deposits			1
for nearly a century here , mining has been one of the few professions guaranteeing a good and consistent salary			0
@entity32 's original story on @entity33 but in the past two years , an increasing number of coal - powered electricity plants across the country have announced closures			1
estimates vary , but banking and industry analysis firm @entity39 put expected and known closures for 2009 - 2012 at 111 plants , that 's one - fifth of the nation 's nearly 500 coal plants			1
there are two main factors in the demise of those plants			2
first , the price of coal 's competitor , natural gas , is decreasing			1
at the same time , a new rule from the @entity54 is pushing the price of coal up			1
that change , called the @entity58 , or @entity59 , rule requires that coal - and oil - fired power plants reduce pollutant emission rates significantly			1
the rule , which operates under the @entity65 , does not stipulate a lower level of carbon output			2
but by requiring lower mercury and other toxic emissions , it would reduce carbon as well			1
coal mining families are n't the only ones facing shifts in industry the @entity54 estimates this will result in some 1 % of national electricity capacity shutting down , and a cost increase of about 3.7 % in retail electricity			1
but those in coal country give much higher estimates			2
they believe if president @entity18 stays in office and the rule continues , it will mean the end of their industry			1
" if coal fell , which is one of the main sources of employment around this area , everything would suffer , " @entity1 said while sitting on her front porch			2
" there 'd be no funding for the schools , which are already suffering			0
i ca n't see how destroying one industry benefits anything			2
" the job is a source of income for the family and pride for @entity8			0
" i like it , " the 30 - year - old said			2
" i enjoy doing it			0
... it 's provided for our family			2
we have a big family and we have n't had to worry about too much			0
" watch behind - the - scenes interview with @entity1 the @entity114 have invested a lot in their home in @entity20 , which is next to the towns where @entity8 and @entity1 grew up			1
when another mining job moved the family away , the @entity118 rented out the 100 - year - old home , keeping a foothold in their community			0
thanks to a new mining job , two weeks ago the @entity114 moved back to the area			0
they put up a " @entity128 " sign in the kitchen			0
" if all coal mines shut down , " @entity1 paused , " we would struggle ... we would definitely lose our house			0
" @entity1 voted for president @entity18 in 2008 and she is not a particular fan of @entity134 , but she 's voting for the @entity135 because she believes he is the only chance the coal industry and her community have to survive			1
@entity134 hopes all this concern helps him in the @entity141 swing state and in other coal communities			1
he has told crowds at campaign speeches that president @entity18 " sure does n't like coal			1
" the president has vigorously disagreed , saying he is for " clean coal			1
" environmentalists believe the @entity54 rule and the increasing closures of coal plants are breakthroughs that are overdue and will do dramatic good			1
@entity154 , the president of the @entity155 , points to studies that coal emissions , including mercury and other pollutants , cause more than 10,000 deaths a year			1
" it 's a war for survival , " @entity154 said , sitting in a @entity162 office filled with piles of reports and papers about the environment			0
" saving lives , not just a handful of lives , but thousands of lives			0
but more broadly , saving the planet			0
" would he like to see all coal plants closed ? " yes , " @entity154 responded , " it would be cleaner , it would be safer and it would help stabilize the climate , which is the big threat to our future			1
i mean it 's even difficult to put a price tag on that			0
" @entity154 sees the problems with coal and climate change as a very human issue that could lead to droughts in some places , including the @entity191 , and floods in other places , like the @entity191 coasts			0
in either case , @entity154 fears loss of crops , homes and lives			0
but the same issue is personal to @entity1			0
every day as @entity8 prepares to go underground , he checks a bulletin board listing the latest coal closures			1
the @entity118 ' five children are still young , aged 16 months to 10 years			2
those old enough to speak already talk about coal			0
when asked what he wants to do when he grows up , 4 - year - old @entity205 blurts out , " coal miner ! " but his parents do n't know if there will be many , or any , coal mining jobs waiting for him in @entity20 when he 's old enough			1
for both sides , the war over coal is personal			0
and it is happening this election year			0
see all of the @entity218 coverage here			0
and track the @entity220 's progress on our map			0
poll : majority oppose controversial coal mining practice @entity226 : working in @entity227 and @entity228 @entity229 offshore drilling : from ' hell no ' to ' ok ' @entity0 's @entity231 contributed to this story .			2

@entity20 , @entity21 , has a *population* of *950* and many residents work in coal industry
coal plant closures in the @entity239 are on the rise ; between 10 - 20 % closed in past three years
