-- it 's hard to imagine a scene more gruesome and disturbing than the one @entity3 encountered on an inner - city street wednesday			2
a person hacked to death , lying in a pool of his own blood			2
his assailants standing nearby , covered in blood and brandishing gore - soaked knives and meat cleavers as they spew violent rhetoric			2
a car smashed into a lamppost a few yards away			2
most bystanders kept their distance , understandably			2
yet one woman directly confronted the apparent murderers -- in fact , she jumped off her bus and rushed to the scene when she saw what looked like a car accident , then stuck around and tried to engage both attackers in conversation even after she realized what was going on			2
the woman , a 48 - year - old mother of two named @entity29 , later said she was trying to talk them down and keep them from hurting anyone else , especially children			0
why did she put herself on the line when so many others stayed away ? we do n't really know enough about @entity37 to be able to say for sure ; perhaps we never will			0
history is filled with heroes , from @entity40 to @entity41 of @entity43 fame , whose life histories could n't have predicted the extraordinary things that they later did			0
cub scout leader , ex-teacher confronted @entity48 terrorist but what we do know , thanks to social psychology , is that what separates people like @entity37 from the rest of us is often extremely subtle			1
in fact , research suggests that many of us , perhaps to our own surprise , have the potential to find our own inner hero			1
what often makes the difference between a bystander and an " upstander " are the particulars of a crisis situation and how those details interact with a person 's background			1
for instance , decades of research on the " bystander effect " has shown that even good , moral people fail to take action when confronted with an emergency			1
one famous study found that the only factor that determined whether bystanders stopped to help someone in need was whether they were in a hurry			0
other research shows people are less likely to help when they 're part of a crowd : they assume either that someone else will take responsibility or that there must not really be a crisis at all if no one else has acted yet			1
taking action would mean going against the norm , breaking from the herd ; they do n't want to rock the boat			0
the bigger the crowd , the more likely all crowd members will do nothing			0
research suggests , for example , that when people can be made to feel a personal connection to a victim , they might intervene in a situation that they would otherwise ignore			1
one @entity107 study even found that people were more willing to help an injured stranger if that stranger were wearing the jersey of their favorite soccer team			1
there are other exceptions as well			0
research by @entity117 psychologist @entity116 , who pioneered the study of the bystander effect , has found no clear personality profile distinguishes the upstanders from the bystanders			1
more important , according to @entity116 and others , is whether people can recognize a crisis and feel they have the skills to help			1
that finding resonated in @entity48 when @entity37 , trying to explain her actions , cited her role as a @entity131 leader , mentioning that she had to learn first aid for the position			1
it was her knowledge of first aid that initially prompted her to get off her bus , thinking that she could help the victim she saw lying on the ground			0
similarly , after @entity141 -- aka the @entity142 -- leaped onto @entity144 subway tracks to save someone who 'd fallen in front of a train back in 2007 , many observers later pointed to @entity141 's @entity149 service to explain why this otherwise unexceptional man sprang to action while everyone else simply watched			0
in their own extensive analysis of what makes a hero , psychologists @entity154 and @entity155 suggest that people who do n't succumb to the bystander effect are sometimes people who generally do n't adhere to social norms and conventions			1
that means they 're prone to intervene and take positive action when no one else will			0
but it may also mean they 're prone to break other rules			0
@entity154 and @entity155 cite the story of @entity170 , who was hailed as a hero after he drove 70 people to safety from the flooding caused by @entity175 , commandeering an abandoned school bus			1
@entity170 thought to do something bold that others would n't do ; he also had an extensive criminal record , which has grown in the years since			0
does this mean we can expect @entity29 to break the law in the not - too - distant future ? hardly			0
but it does challenge the notion that there 's a distinct category of exceptional people who are heroes , elevated above the rest of us			2
@entity154 and @entity155 have argued that deifying heroes like this -- what they call " the myth of the ' heroic elect ' " -- has the perverse effect of making us blind to our own heroic potential			1
if instead we believe we 're capable of heroism ourselves , we 'll be better prepared to realize that potential and snap into action if and when our time comes			2
so science still has n't gotten to the bottom of stories like @entity29 's			0
but perhaps its greatest insight so far is that her story could be ours			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity214 talked to murder *suspects* right after @entity48 hacking to calm them
@entity212 : people who step up like her often think they have skills to help , like she did
marsh : such people , sometimes , are a bit *nonconformist*
he says we all have the potential to shake the " bystander effect " and find our inner hero
