-- when it comes to tablet computers , size matters -- a lot			2
but these devices are definitely not one - size - fits - all			1
and like @entity6 , the " right size " for tablets keeps shifting			1
that 's making the tablet market curiouser and curiouser			0
many @entity12 users treasure the @entity15 gadget 's approximately 10x7 - inch expanse , and i 've seen some bristle at the suggestion that this size might be unwieldy			1
meanwhile , users of the @entity22 or @entity23 often prize having a tablet that slips easily into a pocket or purse for half the price ( or less ) of an @entity12			1
there is a large and fast - growing consumer demand for tablets across a wide range of sizes and price points			2
in february , analysts at @entity35 estimated that 3.9 million @entity22 units were sold in the last quarter of 2011			2
that 's only about a quarter of the number of @entity12 estimated as being sold during that same quarter , but it 's still pretty respectable for a new device			2
the diversifying tablet market also includes the oddball @entity42 -- a moderately pricey , stylus - bearing smartphone / tablet hybrid			2
initially greeted with skepticism , this device ended up selling five million units in its first six months			0
and soon it might come with @entity47 pre-installed			0
could the @entity12 shrink ? rumors have long been swirling that @entity15 might be preparing to launch an " ipad mini " model that 's closer in size to the @entity22			1
@entity52 reported this last week : " according to @entity60 @entity15 news site @entity58 , @entity15 's working with lcd suppliers to get a 5 - inch panel with a pixel density high enough to be able to call it a @entity57			1
that 's according to ' a reliable @entity64 source , ' the site said			0
... that smaller device would arrive sometime next year , @entity58 suggested			0
" of course , before we learn the truth of the elusive mythical ipad mini , the next version of the @entity22 , which could be released as soon as may or june , might feature a model with a larger screen as well as upgraded specifications			1
this week , @entity73 claimed that " newest reports from @entity75 suggest ... that there probably wo n't be a 10 - inch @entity22 2 , but two different 8.9 - inch tablets and a smaller 7 - inch model			1
" yes , i know , these are all just rumors , based on information allegedly leaked from @entity15 's and @entity83 's supply chains			1
but when it comes to upcoming tablet models from highly secretive and competitive electronics giants , that 's all we 've got to go on			0
one thing is clear : the @entity22 and @entity42 are runaway market success stories , despite their smaller screens			1
perhaps even because they 're smaller			0
many consumers clearly want and will use smaller tablets -- both cheaper , simpler models and costlier , more fully featured ones			1
certainly , @entity15 has noticed this development even if , as usual , they wo n't talk about it			2
so for this reason , i would n't be surprised to see @entity15 eventually launch an ipad mini			1
maybe not this year , but perhaps some time in 2013			0
however , it might not necessarily cost much less			0
@entity15 might decide to take the " small is beautiful " approach and market an ipad mini as providing extra , or at least different , value -- not as a compromise			1
that might be totally appropriate , since the perfect size is a matter of preference			0
as @entity112 told the @entity113 : " i should like to be a little larger , sir , if you would n't mind , " said @entity112			0
" three inches is such a wretched height to be			0
" " it is a very good height indeed ! " said the @entity113 angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high )			0
" the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity119 .			0

with tablets , there is now no " one - size - fits - all " answer
ipads *remain* on top , but smaller , sometimes simpler competitors , have made in - roads
rumors say @entity15 may *counter* with @entity12 ' mini , " while @entity22 might get bigger
